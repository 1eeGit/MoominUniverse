00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come. Come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you on your TV they are the movements. They are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:41.000
So come with me give me your hand. I'll take you up to a moment land. You can fly just like a bird. Sing the best song ever.

00:41.000 --> 00:58.000
There were the movements. There were the movements. There were the movements.

01:11.000 --> 01:31.000
There were the movements. There were the movements.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
It was the end of summer but still every day seemed hotter than the last.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
Movement Valley had had no rain for weeks and finally the river had dried up.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Papa says this weather is a catastrophe.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Oh not really.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
But it is. He says movement Valley will turn into a desert if it carries on.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
I don't think that will happen movement.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Papa can't ever remember it so hot even the river has dried up.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
No that does worry me. I can't fish anymore.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
In all my travels I found that droughts like this are always followed by a real heavy downpour.

02:20.000 --> 02:29.000
Well it's too hot for me anyway.

02:30.000 --> 02:39.000
Oh it's so hot I can't think.

02:39.000 --> 02:47.000
I can I can always think of something.

02:48.000 --> 03:08.000
Well well even the weeds are wilting.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
The sea never dries up does it?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Of course not stupid wherever the fish go.

03:13.000 --> 03:23.000
I'm going swimming.

03:24.000 --> 03:47.000
Here you are.

03:47.000 --> 03:57.000
Watch this.

04:18.000 --> 04:27.000
Ah!

04:27.000 --> 04:37.000
Ah!

04:38.000 --> 04:47.000
Ah!

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
Ouch that hurt.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
What's this stupid box doing here?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
I think it's floated from foreign lands.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
What's it got in it?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Perhaps it's full of priceless jewels.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
No it wouldn't float so high in the water if it was.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
A tiara packed in wood shavings.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
I can use a new comb too.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
What have you found you too?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I treasure it.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
No we don't think so. It's not heavy enough.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
But you never know snork maiden.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Let's open it and see.

05:21.000 --> 05:29.000
Come on Slays push me a shore.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Perhaps it's gold nuggets in here.

05:31.000 --> 05:39.000
Are diamonds or something to eat?

05:39.000 --> 05:47.000
What is this?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Well seeds maybe.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
What sort of seeds?

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Well at first glance I'd say they might be tropical plants.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Really?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
What plants are tropical?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Well species like banana or mango.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Banana and mango.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
Well I haven't done a lot of research on tropical plants so I can't be sure but they do look like it.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
I know mama. Why don't we plant them?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Good idea woman.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
The thing is we don't have a tropical climate.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I'm afraid they wouldn't grow here at all.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Let's plant them shall we?

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
They won't bear any fruit so don't get too excited.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
Oh well it seems tropical enough to me Mr. Hanuman.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
At least we can try can't we?

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I want to see what papaya looks like and ugly fruit.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
I want mangoes growing all around my banjo window.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Let's plant them shall we?

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
I tell you they're strictly tropical they won't take root at all.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
It certainly seems that mama is enjoying herself Mr. Hanuman.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I don't think it'll be much use.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Well perhaps not but it's still worth the fun in trying.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Imagine woman valley a tropical jungle.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Huh huh.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Oh Mr. Hanuman.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Do you think these seeds will grow into real fruit trees?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Let me see.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
What have you got here little my?

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
I could very well be mistaken but I think this one is a mango seed.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Thanks.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
And why do you want to know a little my?

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Because I'm only growing fruit trees.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Hmm thanks.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
And why do you want to know a little my?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Because I'm only growing fruit.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
I want to be sure I'm not planning stupid orchids or passion flowers or something.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Mr. Hemuman.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Can you tell me which one of these is banana?

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah I'm not really too sure but I think it's this one.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
You want to grow an orchid too snorke maiden?

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
I just want to plant a banana tree in a really special place.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
It's Moon's favorite fruit.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
I think she'll be disappointed bananas won't grow here.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
This weather doesn't belong here either.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
If it gets any hotter I'll melt.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
I can't wait for dusk so it'll cool down a bit.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Hmm.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
Isn't it wonderful to go to sleep looking at the stars?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And it's not so hot anymore.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
I'll sleep like a log tonight.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
You always do don't you little my?

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Well sleep like an extra heavy log then.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
Snorke maiden, why don't you sleep under that tree with moon men and little my?

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
Because I can't see the stars from there and it makes me feel romantic looking at them.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
But you're going to get very wet if it starts raining in the night.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
You're joking surely mama.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Not at all.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
But it hasn't rained for ages and there aren't any clouds or anything.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Just stars.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
All the toothpicks fell on the floor and that's a sure sign of rain.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Snorke maiden won't mind if she gets all wet.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Moon Mama, that should be happy.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Who, why is that?

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
Because then she'll know that the special tree will start growing and that's very important to her.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
That's true.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Good night everyone.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I hope you sleep well.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Good night everybody.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Good night woman.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Good night, don't snorke.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
It's too hot to sleep.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Why don't you sleep outside like the children?

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I think I will.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
A thunderstorm.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I told you the toothpicks are never wrong.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Hey it's raining movement.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Wake up movement.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Oh is it morning?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
The sun's really bright.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
No it's raining.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Rainy?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Look at that.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
You look I'm getting wet I'm going inside.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
So mama was right about the rain.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Hey snorke maiden.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Doesn't she look sweet?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Snorke maiden.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Is it raining?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
That's very clever.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
Your mother knows everything doesn't she?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
She does.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Not yet.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
I want to feel the rain on my face.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
It's been so long.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
You want to feel it much longer?

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
It's raining.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
It's raining.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Mangoes.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
That's impossible.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Gosh.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
By my tail a jungle that's a tropical jungle.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Wake up, wake up you two.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
There's a jungle outside.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
We've planted a jungle.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
A jungle.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
You're right moment.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Those seeds have not only sprouted.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
I know they're big trees.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I've never known trees to grow like that.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
That's bad.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I know.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I've never known trees to grow like that.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
That's...

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
It's...

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
I think I'll go and play Tarzan.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
I wish my lettuce seeds would do that move in papa.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
There's magic here somewhere mama.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Let's go and explore.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
That's rain drumming on the campus.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
It must be.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Snuffkin?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
What a nurse all this.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Well, we found a crate of tropical seeds

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
and planted them last night.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
And this morning while you can see it's like magic.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
It's fantastic.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
I know.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
We can go on a safari.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I've seen nothing like it.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
What kind of flower is this?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
It looks like an orchid to me.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
This is a real tropical jungle isn't it Snuffkin?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Not quite.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
What do you mean?

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Well, Moomin, a real jungle would have wild animals in it, wouldn't it?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Oh yeah, like tigers and snakes.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
This is more of a tropical botanical garden, I suppose.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
That's Moomin's little mind.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
He can have the peel.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
This is a life.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Stop, little mind.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Well, well.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
What are you looking for dear?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
My solar toady.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
You what?

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
My sun helmet, I can't go into the jungle without it.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I didn't know you had one.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
I used it for a fancy dress party once I know.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I put it in a box somewhere.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Oh, here it is.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Very dashing dear.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
I thought so too.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Oh, I know.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Splendid protection is hat.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
Papa, what in earth are you doing?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
I want to get into the cellar.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
What for?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
To get my gun.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Your gun?

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Only fools venture into the jungle without a proper gun.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I don't think you need a gun, Papa.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
And why not?

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Because there aren't any wild animals.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Well, one of the seas might have been an egg or something.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Look at these, for instance, they look very animal.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Very odd animals.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
More of an odd plant, I think.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
I'd stay away from them.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
They could be very dangerous.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
But they've got eyes.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Careful.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I think they're man-eating plants.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Man-eating.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Stop that.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Help.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Help.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Oh, they're trying to eat me.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
They want to feed me to their young.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, help me.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Oh, help.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
They're tearing my tail.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, oh, dear.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Help.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Oh!

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Oh, no, oh, oh, oh, oh.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Well done, my little maya.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Just saved my life.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Well, I saved your tail, anyway.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Oh.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Oh.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Oh.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Oh, oh.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.600
Oh! It's something to jam this door shut!

17:27.400 --> 17:29.540
Come on! Hurry!

17:31.000 --> 17:34.800
Oh! Oh! Oh, no! We... you can't hold on much longer!

17:34.800 --> 17:36.800
Hmm.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.800
Hmm.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.800
Huh?

17:40.800 --> 17:42.800
Hmm.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.800
Hmm.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.800
Hmm.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.800
Hmm.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.800
Hmm.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.800
Hmm.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.800
That should keep them in now, shouldn't it?

17:54.800 --> 17:56.800
Well, I don't think they could push their way through that lot.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.800
Hmm. They had a very strong grip on my tail.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.800
He mustn't underestimate them.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.800
Anything wrong?

18:02.800 --> 18:07.800
You bet! The seller's full of man-eating plants tried to gobble up moment papa!

18:07.800 --> 18:08.800
Oh!

18:08.800 --> 18:10.800
Oh my goodness!

18:10.800 --> 18:12.800
What's the matter?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.800
You can get straight from the seller into the kitchen.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.800
What? Oh no, mama!

18:28.800 --> 18:30.800
Oh my gosh!

18:30.800 --> 18:32.800
Oh, hello!

18:32.800 --> 18:34.800
Cue, we got here just in time!

18:34.800 --> 18:37.800
What ever's the matter with you? Are you all playing Tarzan?

18:37.800 --> 18:39.800
Oh no, mama!

18:39.800 --> 18:42.800
I'm making grandmas if you ever get a tropical fruit recipe.

18:42.800 --> 18:46.800
And perhaps now it's rained I can wash this dirty floor.

18:48.800 --> 18:54.800
Ah! Ah! By the great bumble I don't believe this a tropical rainforest!

18:54.800 --> 18:56.800
Ah! Ah!

18:56.800 --> 19:00.800
Ah! Ah! Transcendentia megaloids!

19:00.800 --> 19:03.800
And yes, a dispensia florian wonder!

19:03.800 --> 19:08.800
Goodness me, I can collect a whole tropical hermoreum right here in Moomin Valley!

19:08.800 --> 19:12.800
Ah, Trowel, that's what I need. I'll get one from the Moomins!

19:12.800 --> 19:16.800
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

19:16.800 --> 19:20.800
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

19:20.800 --> 19:21.800
Yeah.

19:21.800 --> 19:22.800
Yeah.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.000
Must say they're not the tiniest family.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.240
I'll have to move this.

19:26.240 --> 19:30.040
Oh, this old furniture.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.040
Yeah.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.040
Yeah.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.040
Yeah.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.040
Yeah.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.040
Huh.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.040
Huh.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.040
Huh.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.040
Huh.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.040
Huh.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.040
Huh.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.040
Huh.

19:41.040 --> 19:42.040
Huh.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.040
Huh.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.040
Huh.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.040
Huh.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.040
Huh.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.040
Huh.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.040
Huh.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.040
Huh.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.040
Huh.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.040
Huh.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.040
Huh.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.040
Huh.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.040
Oh, here we go.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.040
Me get out with Ormysik.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.040
Huh.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.040
Huh.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.040
Huh.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.040
Huh.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.040
Help!

20:01.040 --> 20:03.040
I've got many things planned after this.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.040
What?

20:04.040 --> 20:05.040
They must have got out.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.040
Huh.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.040
Huh.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.040
Huh.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.040
Huh.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.040
Huh.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.040
Huh.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.040
Huh.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.040
Huh.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.040
Huh.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.040
Huh.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.040
Huh.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.040
Huh.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.040
Huh.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.040
Huh.

20:19.040 --> 20:21.040
They were in the cellar.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.040
Did you open the door, Mr. Hamilin?

20:23.040 --> 20:24.040
Well, yes.

20:24.040 --> 20:27.040
I wanted to borrow a trowel.

20:27.040 --> 20:30.040
Mr. Hamilin, you know all about plants.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.040
Do you have any idea how we can get rid of them?

20:32.040 --> 20:34.040
They're man-eaters, you know?

20:34.040 --> 20:35.040
Can't rid of them.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.040
Huh.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.040
Well, let's see.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.040
We are in a bit of a fix.

20:39.040 --> 20:42.040
I have heard that they have reacted to music.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.040
Music.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.040
Snoopkin, you could play your harmonica.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.040
Hmm.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.040
Hmm.

21:03.040 --> 21:06.040
Look, they've started dancing.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.040
Keep it up, Snoopkin.

21:19.040 --> 21:27.040
What will they do if he stops playing?

21:27.040 --> 21:29.040
I really don't know.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.040
Oh, what's this?

21:37.040 --> 21:38.040
Oh.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.040
Oh.

21:47.040 --> 21:51.040
They're rather sweet when they don't try to eat you.

21:51.040 --> 21:54.040
And that was how a tropical jungle grew

21:54.040 --> 21:57.040
and surrounded movement house in one night.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.040
Is it going to stay?

21:59.040 --> 22:00.040
And for how long?

22:00.040 --> 22:03.040
And what will the man-eating plants do

22:03.040 --> 22:06.040
if Snoopkin stops playing?

22:08.040 --> 22:10.040
They love the laughter

22:10.040 --> 22:15.040
and they love the living, the movements.

22:15.040 --> 22:18.040
Believing in sharing and caring

22:18.040 --> 22:23.040
and giving the movements.

22:23.040 --> 22:27.040
They're always happy and always at play.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.040
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:30.040 --> 22:34.040
The movements.

22:34.040 --> 22:37.040
They love the laughter

22:37.040 --> 22:41.040
and they love the living, the movements.

22:41.040 --> 22:45.040
Believing in sharing and caring

22:45.040 --> 22:49.040
and giving the movements.

22:49.040 --> 22:53.040
They're always happy and always at play.

22:53.040 --> 22:57.040
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.040
The movements.

22:59.040 --> 23:03.040
They're taking the movements.

23:03.040 --> 23:07.040
The movements.

23:07.040 --> 23:13.040
The movements.
