1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Therefore you are your TV.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think it's a good idea. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:47,000
sing the best song ever, there were the movements, there was the movement,

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There was the movement, there was the movement,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:33,379
There was the movement, there was the movement, These days, women and snuffkin were together even more than ever. Winter would hit the Moon Valley any day now, and then they would have to part.

13
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:38,620
Moon had to go into hibernation and snuff into the forest for himself.

14
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,620
Huh?

15
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,620
Little one.

16
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:46,000
You look sad, for something upset you?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Where are you off to, Moomin?

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
To the lonely mountains.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How come you two are always stealing off somewhere?

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We're not stealing off. We're just going for a walk to lonely mountains.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Just the two of you? You're even worse than usual, never taking any of us with you.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I hadn't noticed are we really doing that?

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm not sure maybe we are.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No, maybe's about it and let me tell you it's very rude.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But we were just off for a walk.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I know.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well then, why are you going?

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It'll start snowing any day now little mite

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and then we won't be able to go anywhere will we?

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We wanted a last look at moving valley from above

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
before that happens.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,599
A likely story. But it's true, I'm off very soon and I wanted to see it all to give me a picture to remember

33
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,639
while I'm walking.

34
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,479
Hmm. Did you hear that, Snarkman? Sniff, come here!

35
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:42,240
Blow in, do you mind if we come along with you? Of course not.

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,360
You see, we thought you were probably plotting something secret

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
and weren't letting any of us in on it.

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,080
Oh, come on, we don't have any secrets from you.

39
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,159
It's just that, well, you know what I mean.

40
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,120
Snuff can be leaving for months and months very soon.

41
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,039
Never mind off we go.

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,319
It would be fun to see it all from here in the middle of winter all white. Must be very beautiful.

43
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,719
Oh, I don't think so.

44
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,599
With everything white and clean.

45
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,759
In summer, it's very beautiful.

46
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:20,520
Well, I'm coming back here in winter to see it for myself.

47
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,599
You can't do that, you're hibernating.

48
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,159
Well, maybe not.

49
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,000
I thought that this year I'd tried to keep awake all winter.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You mean just like Moomin and I did last year?

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes!

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You could never do it.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What about you? Are you hibernating?

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm not all that mad about the snow and the cold and darks all hibernate.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm very happy to be going home. I've seen it all now.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, we didn't ask you to come along a little like.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Why don't we go take a look at that beautiful lake against sniff,

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the one with the golden fish?

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh, no, that's too far away.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Ah, you're just afraid of the forest of witches, aren't you, Sniff?

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Not at all, I'm not a bit scared.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hey, look! Who's that?

63
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,379
Nobody, I know wonder what she's doing here sitting down don't say such silly things sniff

64
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,519
Hello there

65
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,000
What are you doing up there? Hello there! What are you doing up there?

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm waiting!

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
For what?

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
For grandma?

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Out here all alone.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,160
Well grandma told me there was a big rock by the path leading up to Lonely Mountains

71
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,439
into wait there.

72
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,439
But there are other rocks by the path you know?

73
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,240
Oh are there?

74
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,000
But this is the only one I've seen so far.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Your grandma must be crazy or something

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
making you wait in a place like this.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, our house is in the forest and she's coming to show me the way.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
In the forest?

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You mean the forest of witches?

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes, I suppose so. It's not very far from here.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's it, definitely.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
How long have you been waiting here?

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh, about an hour.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,800
One hour?

85
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,360
She's not very punctual.

86
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,199
Perhaps I was early.

87
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes, she was an hour early.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,600
Oh, it's grandma.

89
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Welcome, Alicia.

90
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:28,000
Where do you find all these children, my dear? I was waiting here all alone and then they came along the path and wanted to help.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Very kind of you, I'm sure. Well don't just stand there, my dear. Let's go!

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Come along!

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Excuse me, excuse me, ma'am, but don't you live in the forest?

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And did I do? Excuse me, excuse me, ma'am, but don't you live in the forest?

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And did I do?

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
In what part of it?

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let me see, it must be about right in the middle.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Interesting.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The only place I know of is an old house where they say,

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
which is used to live.

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You don't say, young man.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well, what do you know?

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What will you think of next?

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Her grandmother is... A witch, I think?

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But surely, they don't exist.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,480
Of course not, like dragons don't exist.

107
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,439
Well, she doesn't seem like a nasty one.

108
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,240
How can you tell, Moments?

109
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,959
I don't think that nice girl would have a bad one for a grandma.

110
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,720
Perhaps not.

111
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,279
So tell me what makes you think she's a witch, eh?

112
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,560
Who else could live in that forest, Papa?

113
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,360
I don't know. I can can think of anyone right now,

114
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,160
but some people would like it.

115
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,000
Yes, I suppose you're right.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,279
I hope you are.

117
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,720
I've lived in Moomin Valley for a long time,

118
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,160
and I've never once seen a witch.

119
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,399
So they don't exist?

120
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Yeah.

121
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,279
Oh, stop working now, Snork.

122
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,000
Dinner's ready.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm coming.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No wonder it's so light. Look, the moon is up.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Snork, Maiden. I think it would be very wise for you to stay with the movements from tonight on.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Why on earth do you think that, Snork?

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I've decided not to hibernate this winter.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,120
Why ever not? Leon Earth, do you think that's Norck? I've decided not to hibernate this winter.

129
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,279
Why ever not?

130
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,160
I want to complete the blueprint for my new flying ship

131
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,040
by next spring.

132
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,040
For a real inventor, sleep is an unnecessary luxury.

133
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,759
Science, my dear Snork Maiden, will not wait

134
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,759
while inventors take a nap.

135
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,439
But you know, dear Snork, how dependent you are

136
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,600
in your sleep.

137
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
I'll stay awake.

138
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Very well, then.

139
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,480
This winter, I will hibernate with the movements.

140
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,839
Excellent.

141
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,240
Shall we have dinner?

142
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,319
I'm ready now.

143
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,160
Well, certainly snorks.

144
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,000
Snork maiden will be just fine here with us.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Thank you.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is nice for Moomin too. Now he'll have Snork Maiden to keep him company.

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But who needs company when they're hibernating after all Noomin will be fast asleep?

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Never the less. Sleeping is much nicer when someone else sleeps in the same room.

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,360
When do we start hibernating, do you think?

151
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,399
With weather like this in another few days, I guess.

152
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,839
So early?

153
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,680
We'll have snow before the week is out.

154
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,919
Well, good luck with your new blueprint, Snork.

155
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,120
I look forward to seeing your flying ship in the spring.

156
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,960
Hmm, come this time next year, I'll definitely be flying about.

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Thanks again for taking Snork, Maiden. That's not trouble at all. Good night then. Good night snork. See you snorkmaiden. Good luck this winter snork. Thank goodness at last I can really concentrate on my work.

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Ah?

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't believe this!

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Am I hallucinating?

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh, no!

162
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh!

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh, which I'm sure it was. I'm positive. I'm a broomstick. When the snorke gets an idea in his head, it's not much room for anyone or anything else, is there?

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I hope you'll succeed this time.

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
At least in my dream that rounding really flew well.

166
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I often dream that I fly, but I wouldn't dream of trying it out.

167
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Snook must have had some sort of a new idea.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh!

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's snorke!

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What's the matter?

171
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh, that's my piece of cake. You look like you've seen a ghost.

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Not a ghost. She laughed at me.

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Who did? She was flying on a broom.

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No engine at all.

175
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Are you talking about the witch?

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What's the use? There's no point if you can do it so easily.

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Hurry up and get yourself together. You really so are? Yes. Are you talking about the witch? What's the use? There's no point if you can do it so easily.

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hurry up and get yourself together.

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You really so are?

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes.

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But where?

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Right near here.

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I can't see any witch up there, Snork.

184
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Just the moon up in the sky!

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And she was really flying in the sky? Is that what Snork said?

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Well, he should know about things that fly.

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Hmm. But I just can't believe it until I've seen it myself.

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,360
If she really is a witch, then what about the girl?

189
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,639
I mean, no one could be happy living with a witch.

190
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,519
I really don't know. I thought witches had to be old.

191
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,120
Maybe it's not her real grandmother. She could be adopted.

192
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,960
Well, Mumin, we must get to the bottom of this.

193
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Yes, Nufkin. We must.

194
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Hmm.

195
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Ah.

196
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,440
Hmm.

197
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,500
Hmm. Hmm. We must.

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,500
Ha, I caught you at it again, you and your secret plan.

199
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Where are you going? Today you can't come with us with a little fly.

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And why not?

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Because we're going on a dangerous mission.

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We're going to the forest of witches.

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,879
Well, if you're in any danger, then I must certainly come along to look after you,

204
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,399
Moon, and come on.

205
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,399
Besides, nothing's exciting to happen to me

206
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:25,000
since I went up with that kite. This is what we'll do. I grabbed the witch and while she's helpless, you two grabbed the girl and whisk her away to safety.

207
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That sounds great, but we don't know if she is a witch little my. If we grab her and she isn't a witch, it would be embarrassing and we could all be in trouble.

208
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Maybe the witch needed an innocent maiden to try out some potions to experiment on her.

209
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Maybe, let's find out.

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
How do we find out?

211
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
By snooping around, I suppose.

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,879
I hope you'll think of something a bit better than that before we get there.

213
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,440
Let's hide as close to the house as we can and then ask the girl as soon as she comes

214
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,720
out.

215
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,320
And what if she doesn't come out, Snuffkin?

216
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,120
Then we'll improvise a little more.

217
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,480
So this is the famous plan by the great Snuffkin.

218
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,000
Look, if she doesn't come out of the house,

219
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
we'll just go up a knock on the door.

220
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Once we're inside, I'm sure we'll be able to tell what's really what.

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't think it's a very good idea.

222
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What if she catches us balance?

223
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Little Mime will wait outside,

224
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and if we don't come out, she can run back to Moomin Valley for help.

225
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,799
That's fine, but Moomin can wait outside and all search the house.

226
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:29,600
Oh no, little Mai, you can wait outside and I will search the house.

227
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,799
Let's do it this way.

228
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,100
You stay outside and if we get caught, try to free us.

229
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,519
And run for help as quickly as you can only if you can't.

230
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,519
Is that okay?

231
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,759
Hmm, that means if you're in trouble, your lives will be in my hands.

232
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:43,759
That's right, little Mai.

233
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,600
I don't like the sound of this.

234
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,200
I'm not sure I want little my to be my last hope.

235
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,500
Well, I wouldn't now, but anyone who doesn't trust me, that's for sure.

236
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Here's that, see what I mean?

237
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Shh! Be quiet!

238
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
There's a house!

239
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,000
Look at this. It's very quiet. Do you think there's anybody home?

240
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't know. Let's wait a while and see.

241
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Do we have to stay absolutely still?

242
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But of course we do. We'll feel extremely silly if the house is empty.

243
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
They disappeared. They could have told us where they were going.

244
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm sure I don't care. Little Mywin too I think.

245
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
She's betraying us. That's just like her.

246
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't worry. I've got a pretty good idea where they were heading for.

247
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You know where they've gone? Why didn't you tell me? Where are they?

248
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
They've gone to the forest of witches.

249
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What?

250
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
They've gone to see whether the woman we met yesterday is a real witch.

251
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
A real one?

252
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,580
Why don't we go there too? I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find my way, Sniff.

253
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,159
Uh...uh...

254
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,159
What is it?

255
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,960
I don't know, it's my stomach. I better lie down.

256
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,759
Oh, it's very painful.

257
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,759
Oh...

258
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,159
Oh, how much longer we can have to stay here like this.

259
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,000
This adventure isn't the least bit exciting.

260
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Well, let's wait a little bit longer. Be quiet. At least we know the girl is definitely in there.

261
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
No, we don't. She might be out. She could be anywhere.

262
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I know that's possible, but I don't think so.

263
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
She's getting some water.

264
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
As I thought, that way she's working hard to the bone. Hey. She's getting some water.

265
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
As I thought, that bitch is working her to the bone.

266
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Hey, little boy!

267
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
She's following that girl!

268
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You go with her, Moomin, and find out as much as you possibly can about what's going on.

269
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll watch the house.

270
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Right.

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Hey, wait for me! Oh I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.

272
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

273
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

274
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

275
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

276
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

277
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

278
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

279
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

280
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

281
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. If you're looking for Alicia, she's out.

282
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh, no!

283
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,500
Listen, wait and see. I wasn't doing anything wrong!

284
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Why did you try to run away then?

285
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,500
Oh! I'll help you with that!

286
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
So will I!

287
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,000
How kind of you! It is a bit heavy to carry, you know!

288
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,500
I think I remember your name! Is it Alicia?

289
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,039
Yes it is! I'm so glad you Is it Alicia? Yes, it is.

290
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,960
I'm so glad you remembered it.

291
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,400
My name is Lumin.

292
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,240
And I'm Lumin.

293
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,640
What are you doing here in the forest of witches?

294
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,200
Well, to be perfectly honest,

295
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,920
we came because we were rather worried about you.

296
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
What about me?

297
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
Why is that?

298
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,319
Is that a woman really your grandmother?

299
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,319
Of course.

300
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,079
You're quite sure?

301
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,240
Yes, of course.

302
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,519
She's my mother's mother.

303
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:51,920
Why do you ask? Well, don't you know? He's trying to ask. That's cool. Maybe your grandmother

304
00:17:51,920 --> 00:18:00,079
is a witch. Yes, she is. Of course. Oh, I'm sorry. I was a bit taken aback. You don't

305
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:08,839
mind about your grandmother being a real witch? Oh, no! That's what she is! I was husband! I'm going to be one too when I'm grown up!

306
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,640
Oh no! You couldn't!

307
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,880
Well, you don't look anything like one!

308
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,039
Well, that's because I'm not one yet!

309
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,559
When you're born into a witch family, that's what you become, but it's not that easy, you know?

310
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,559
Oh, this is too much!

311
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,039
Now, tell me, what are you doing here in the forest of witches?

312
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,839
You don't sound like a witch.

313
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,759
Oh, really?

314
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,359
What do witches sound like?

315
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,720
Well, to be honest, you're the first one I've ever met in my whole life.

316
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,519
I'm sure that's just what you think, young man.

317
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:39,559
Is it true that the nice girl is really your granddaughter?

318
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,759
Certainly.

319
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,640
A very promising young girl.

320
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,000
Honest and hardworking, and with a lot of training,

321
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
she will make an excellent witch someday.

322
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But how can you possibly turn such a sweet girl into a witch?

323
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The sweetest girls make the best witches.

324
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Hello, didn't know you were back, grandma.

325
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Thank you for getting the water, Alicia.

326
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Oh, who's that?

327
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't know.

328
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Some naive young man ought to rescue a damsel

329
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and distress no now.

330
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,299
I remember you, your snuffkin.

331
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,200
Yes.

332
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:13,000
Your friend snuffkins in here, why don't you come in too?

333
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,099
In the house?

334
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:15,099
Really?

335
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,000
He's brought friends with him, Addy.

336
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,500
Sofkin, whatever they don't do you.

337
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
I'll take care of that.

338
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,700
Wait a second, I'll do it for you.

339
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,000
I'll take care of that. Wait a second. I'll do it for you. I'll fix it.

340
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm here!

341
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Wait. I'm gonna need you again.

342
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Where are you going?

343
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I don't think that snake ever got bitten before.

344
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll get another.

345
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm very curious. Why are you three here?

346
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
They came all the way from Moomin Valley

347
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,440
because they were really worried about me, Grandma.

348
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,640
Weren't about you?

349
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,839
Yes, they thought you might be nasty to me, so they came all this way to see if I needed help.

350
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,400
This always happens.

351
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,039
People treat witches as if they weren't ordinary, respectable, responsible citizens.

352
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,200
No, no, we're very sorry.

353
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,519
We realize.

354
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,440
She's quite okay and she's most welcome

355
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,599
to visit us in Moomin Valley at any time, isn't she, Snuffkin? Yes, certainly.

356
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:17,480
What? You said you'd visit these people? Oh, yes. I thought I'd go over there sometimes

357
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,279
after I finished with my homework, of course. I would never leave my studies half done.

358
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:25,960
Sorry, Alicia, but if you ever want to become a good witch,

359
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,759
you mustn't see any ordinary mortals.

360
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:30,119
Oh, why not?

361
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,559
I've only just become friends with them, Grandma, please.

362
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,480
I know.

363
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,160
Why don't I wait a year and study to be a witch next year?

364
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,000
Alicia.

365
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,039
This is family business.

366
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,000
So if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you were to leave.

367
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'd like you to go immediately if you please.

368
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's snowing! Well, she certainly won't be able to visit us at Moomin Valley is buried in snow, so we

369
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
might never see her again.

370
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
No, that's right, and you'll be leaving soon, won't you, Snuffkin?

371
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Winter had come once again to Moomin Valley. Yeah. Leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

372
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
They're always happy and goes at play

373
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The moments are having fun day after day, the movements

374
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The movements, the movements The Moons
