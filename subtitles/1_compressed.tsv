0	21000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.
29000	35000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.
35000	46000	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,
46000	58000	there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.
76000	91220	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
97560	100880	Have you ever heard of Moombin valley?
100880	110480	In winter, deep white snow covers the whole valley, and everyone goes to sleep so that they
110480	112480	keep warm.
112480	123760	Look, there's a woman house.
123760	131640	This woman, our hero,
131640	140920	and Papa, and Mum and Mama.
140920	154440	And this little bundle must be little my.
154440	176160	I think before our story starts, we'd better wake everyone up with some spring sunshine.
176160	196160	At last, it's spring.
196160	204160	Wake up everyone, it's spring time.
204160	224480	I can't help it if I'm happy.
224480	226280	So yeah, woke me.
226280	231000	I was having a lovely dream about living in a watermelon, but it's beautiful outside.
231000	234000	Oh gee, isn't it, is it really moving?
234000	241360	Yes, it's all fresh, the flowers are out and the sun is shining, so I like being asleep.
241360	245360	But it's spring, you said you wanted me to wake you as soon as spring was here.
245360	246960	Oh boy, did I?
246960	249160	Yes, you did little my.
249160	252640	You said you wanted to be a welcome as soon as spring was here.
252640	253640	Really?
253640	254640	Yes, you did.
254640	258000	Did I say something like that?
258000	260000	You can go back to bed if you want to.
260000	262320	Nobody's making you get up, little my.
262320	266000	No, there's really no point, Mum, and I'm not sleepy anymore.
266000	270000	Well, there you are then.
270000	271000	Mama!
271000	273000	Good spring, Mum.
273000	275840	Mum, and Mama, I'm starving.
275840	277560	Have you got any water, Mellon?
277560	280560	No, but there's lots of other things.
280560	287560	You'll all have a nice, big breakfast.
287560	294560	I can hear a snuff gun.
304560	309560	Wouldn't it be quicker to use the stairs?
309560	311560	More fun this way.
311560	313560	Are you going home now?
313560	318560	Yes, thanks very much for letting me spend the winter here.
318560	320560	Don't think your sister will be back yet, though.
320560	322560	I'll go anyway.
328560	331560	Snuff gun!
331560	333560	Oh, hello, Mum.
333560	335560	It's really good to see you, Snuffkin.
335560	337560	And you too.
337560	339560	Jack Arley, weren't you having a good time?
339560	341560	Yes, I was.
341560	344560	But I didn't want to miss springtime in Mum and Valley.
344560	346560	What did you do?
346560	348560	I'll tell you later.
348560	352560	Let's go wake up, Snuff, and think of something exciting to do.
352560	354560	I don't think he'll like it.
363560	366560	He's still snoring, Mum, and I'll do it again.
368560	372560	Well, that's done it.
374560	378560	Come on, Snuff, it's spring. Snuffkin's here.
378560	380560	Please go away, you two.
380560	383560	We're going to do something really exciting.
383560	385560	Like what, Momen?
385560	388560	I can think of more exciting things to do than this.
388560	392560	Well, let's imagine that we're the first ever to climb this mountain.
392560	394560	It's such a clear day.
394560	396560	We'll be able to see all of Mum and Valley
396560	398560	when we get to the top and the sea.
403560	405560	Good morning, Mr. Emulant.
405560	408560	Morning, Mum, and are your father and mother up?
408560	409560	Yes.
409560	411560	Mum was when I came out.
412560	413560	Good.
413560	416560	I'll never understand how you can sleep for months on end.
416560	417560	We like it.
425560	429560	Why do they always have to do something exciting?
433560	435560	What a gorgeous view.
435560	437560	It really is.
437560	441560	Hey, look, they're small coming from Mum and House.
441560	443560	We should have stayed at home.
443560	446560	My bet Mum and Mama's cooking something good.
446560	447560	Look.
447560	448560	What is it?
448560	450560	We're not the first here after all.
450560	452560	Look over there.
454560	455560	Top hat.
459560	461560	Hmm, a rather large one.
461560	463560	I wonder who's how it is.
466560	469560	I don't know, but I know Papa would like it.
474560	477560	Hmm, it's much too big.
481560	483560	Oh dear, what's it?
484560	486560	It really gets inside.
488560	489560	You see?
489560	491560	I've never put my horn on.
496560	498560	Oh, I can't movement it.
498560	499560	Stop, Mum.
504560	506560	Oh, that's enough nonsense.
506560	508560	I think I'll take it off now.
510560	512560	What's the matter?
512560	515560	I can't move it. It's stuck, Mum.
518560	519560	I'll give you a hand.
519560	521560	Paul, it's harder.
526560	528560	Oh, that's better.
528560	529560	Thank you.
529560	530560	What's all this noise?
530560	533560	Papa's head got stuck in the hat, Mum.
533560	535560	Oh, yes, and where did that come from?
535560	536560	Oh, Mum and Mama.
536560	540560	The children found it when they were out and brought it back for me.
540560	541560	Very smart.
543560	545560	What shall we do with it, Papa?
545560	547560	There is something strange about it.
547560	549560	Shall I throw it away then?
549560	552560	Oh, no, it's too good for that.
552560	554560	Do we know anyone with a very big hand?
554560	556560	No, Mum and Papa.
557560	559560	I know what we can do with it.
559560	563560	Ah, it's a...
563560	565560	A waste paper basket, Mum and Mama.
565560	567560	That's right. Well done, Snuffkin.
567560	569560	That was easy.
569560	573560	Come on, Snuffkin. Come and have some breakfast with us.
587560	589560	Beautiful.
600560	602560	Yes.
602560	605560	Sorry to disturb you, but I'm going to see Mumin.
605560	606560	Uh-huh.
606560	608560	Do you want to come with me, Snork?
608560	609560	Uh-huh.
609560	611560	Or would you rather stay here?
611560	612560	Uh-huh.
612560	614560	Well, are you coming or not?
614560	615560	Uh-huh.
615560	616560	Not coming, man?
616560	617560	Uh-huh.
617560	618560	Snork?
618560	622560	Well,~] you know my flying ship is almost finished.
623560	625560	It'll be ready this year, you'll see.
625560	627560	This is in his starlet moment.
631560	635560	Oh, dear. Perhaps it needs a little more work.
639560	642560	I wonder if you really can make a flying ship.
642560	645560	Don't be silly, of course you can't.
645560	647560	A little bit more.
647560	650560	I wonder if you really can make a flying ship.
650560	652560	Silly, of course you can't.
652560	655560	A little, my Snorks always dreamed about doing it.
655560	657560	Dreams are all right.
657560	660560	Yes, as long as they're not impossible.
660560	662560	I suppose so.
667560	670560	Snuff, you're not still feeding your face, are you?
670560	672560	Do you ever dream, Snuff?
672560	676560	Only nightmares about having no food at all, little, my.
681560	685560	Hmm, I wonder who dropped this.
685560	688560	Now where can I put it?
688560	691560	Oh, there you are.
691560	693560	Just the thing.
711560	713560	Oh.
725560	726560	Oh.
726560	727560	Wow.
727560	729560	Golly, what are they?
729560	731560	They're clouds.
731560	734560	Be careful, don't touch it. It might be poisonous.
734560	736560	It feels like cotton.
736560	737560	Well, eee.
738560	741560	This is great, I'm floating wonderful.
744560	746560	Can I try?
746560	748560	Are you ready, Snork Maiden?
748560	751560	Here we go.
761560	763560	What have you got to hide?
763560	765560	My phone.
766560	768560	Wait for me.
768560	771560	Hey, wait for me.
771560	773560	Whoa.
773560	775560	Whoa.
775560	777560	Hey, wait for me.
777560	779560	Let me get on.
779560	780560	Ow.
780560	783560	Ow, I'm falling.
788560	793560	Mumen Papa is in his study, trying to write his memoirs.
794560	797560	A lot has happened to him over the years.
797560	799560	An awful lot.
799560	802560	And he's trying to remember it.
808560	811560	What was that?
811560	813560	Mumen.
813560	814560	Hi, Papa.
814560	816560	What are you doing out there?
816560	817560	We're flying.
817560	820560	The clouds just came out of the house.
820560	823560	Yeah, try and get nearest so I can reach you.
823560	825560	Oh.
825560	826560	No, I'm alright.
826560	827560	Why don't you come for a ride?
827560	829560	Stop, wait a minute.
829560	830560	It's great.
830560	832560	You feel like a bird.
832560	833560	Mumen.
833560	834560	Oh.
834560	836560	Come on, Papa. Jump or you'll fall.
836560	838560	I think it's too late.
838560	839560	Oh.
845560	846560	Mumen Mama quickly.
846560	847560	What's the matter?
847560	849560	Have you seen what the children are doing?
850560	851560	Yes.
851560	852560	Look at them.
852560	854560	They're flying about on clouds.
854560	855560	It can't be safe.
855560	857560	Don't worry, Papa.
857560	858560	It's alright.
858560	860560	I told them to be careful.
862560	864560	Come on, Snapping.
866560	867560	Damn.
868560	870560	I won, I won.
871560	872560	Whoa.
872560	874560	Hey, wait a little cloud.
874560	875560	Wait for me.
875560	876560	Don't go away.
876560	877560	Oh.
877560	878560	I got you.
878560	879560	That was three times.
879560	881560	And I'm going to climb right up here.
881560	882560	And I'm going to get you right there.
882560	883560	This branch.
883560	884560	Come on.
884560	885560	Come on, little cloud.
885560	886560	I'm going to take you with me.
886560	887560	Hey, come on.
887560	888560	You just keep coming back.
888560	889560	Yeah.
889560	890560	Yeah.
890560	891560	I got you now.
891560	892560	You are going to get away from me.
892560	893560	Here I go.
893560	894560	Come on.
894560	895560	All of that ledge.
895560	896560	Come on.
896560	897560	Stop.
897560	899560	I want you.
900560	901560	Oh.
905560	906560	Oh, boy.
906560	907560	What's happening?
907560	909560	My cloud's starting to go.
909560	910560	Oh, whoa, whoa.
910560	911560	That was fun.
911560	914560	Yeah, it was, but I wasn't ready to stop.
914560	916560	Look, there's movement in Snork Maiden.
916560	917560	Hey.
917560	921560	Why have they still got cloud snuffed in?
921560	923560	There's a starting to go as well.
923560	925560	I think they'd better get off.
925560	926560	Hey.
929560	938560	All right.
938560	939560	All right.
939560	941560	I'll start counting.
941560	943560	One, two, three.
943560	945560	Do you want something, little mime?
945560	946560	Oh, yes.
946560	947560	A place to hide.
947560	949560	Five...
949560	954560	Six...
954560	958560	Seven...
958560	964560	Boy, I don't think there's any place to hide in here, is there?
964560	966560	No!
966560	969560	Oh, it's too dirty in there.
969560	970560	I'm gonna have...
970560	971560	I know.
971560	973560	I'll hide in the head.
981560	983560	One, two, one, two, one.
984560	987560	She hit!
1002560	1004560	Oh!
1011560	1012560	Gotcha!
1013560	1015560	What's going on?
1015560	1017560	Huh?
1017560	1019560	Huh?
1019560	1021560	Huh?
1021560	1025560	Snort made, huh?
1035560	1039560	Hehehe!
1039560	1041560	Baaah!
1043560	1045560	Moomin must be around here somewhere.
1045560	1049560	Well, last time I saw him, he was hiding in the fireplace.
1049560	1051560	Have you found him yet?
1051560	1053560	No. Have you looked in the cellar?
1053560	1055560	Yes, I have.
1057560	1059560	Wait a minute. Did you hear someone laughing?
1059560	1061560	Where'd it come from?
1061560	1063560	G.I. better go home.
1063560	1065560	Oh, is there anything wrong?
1065560	1068560	Yes. I can't find Moomin anywhere.
1068560	1070560	Well, he's too fat to be most places.
1074560	1076560	He's coming from under the hat!
1082560	1084560	Well, here I am, sniff.
1084560	1086560	Oh, on earth are you!
1088560	1090560	I one land didn't I?
1090560	1092560	You looked everywhere in the house
1092560	1094560	and you couldn't find me, could you?
1094560	1096560	So I won!
1096560	1098560	I don't want to find you anyway!
1098560	1100560	Well, you were trying hard enough, weren't you?
1100560	1102560	What is this, a new game?
1102560	1104560	My name's Snork Maiden.
1104560	1106560	What's yours?
1106560	1108560	I'm the king of Moomin Valley.
1108560	1110560	My pretty one.
1110560	1112560	You're too ugly to be the king of anything.
1112560	1116560	Well, now, that's not a very nice thing to say to your friend.
1116560	1118560	Is it, Papa?
1118560	1122560	Now, you'd better tell me what you have done with Moomin, huh?
1122560	1124560	But I'm here.
1124560	1126560	Right here.
1126560	1130560	Who are you? And where is Moomin?
1132560	1134560	Papa.
1134560	1136560	I'm certainly not your Papa.
1136560	1138560	Yes, you are. Come on. I'm Moomin.
1138560	1140560	I don't know who you are.
1140560	1142560	But you're not Moomin.
1142560	1144560	He's nice and handsome and nothing like you.
1144560	1148560	Have you looked at yourself in a mirror?
1148560	1150560	Ah!
1150560	1152560	Where's my nose gone?
1152560	1154560	I can't hear it anymore.
1154560	1156560	Ah! Oh no!
1156560	1158560	My tail's all pushy!
1158560	1160560	Ah!
1160560	1162560	Oh!
1164560	1166560	Ah!
1166560	1168560	This is terrible!
1168560	1170560	Oh!
1174560	1176560	Who are you?
1176560	1178560	What have you done with me?
1178560	1180560	It must be a nightmare!
1180560	1182560	I want to go back!
1182560	1186560	Go away, you're horrible!
1186560	1188560	Dear me, what's all this noise?
1188560	1190560	What's happened?
1192560	1194560	Mama!
1194560	1196560	Mama!
1196560	1198560	What earth is this?
1198560	1200560	He says he's Moomin, but just look at him.
1200560	1202560	You don't look like I'm Moomin.
1202560	1204560	I am, I am.
1204560	1206560	Please believe me, Mama.
1206560	1208560	I am Moomin.
1208560	1210560	Well, I don't know.
1210560	1212560	I'm sure.
1212560	1214560	Something's happened to me.
1214560	1216560	Why do I look so different?
1216560	1218560	Now then calm down.
1218560	1220560	This won't help at all.
1220560	1222560	We don't need all this noise.
1222560	1224560	If you really are Moomin,
1224560	1226560	then everything will be all right.
1226560	1228560	Just give me a minute or two and I'll know.
1228560	1230560	Mama, call me Moomin, please.
1230560	1232560	I don't know what's happened, but I am me.
1232560	1234560	Honestly, I am.
1234560	1236560	Mama, please believeed me.
1236560	1238560	Let me see.
1238560	1240560	Oh, Mama, you do know it's me.
1240560	1242560	You must.
1242560	1244560	You can't forget your little Moomin.
1244560	1246560	Please, Mama, please, Mama.
1246560	1248560	Oh, hush now, hush now.
1256560	1258560	Mama!
1258560	1260560	Shh!
1260560	1266560	Yes, you're my little Moomin, all right.
1266560	1268560	Oh, Mama!
1280560	1282560	Oh.
1285560	1288560	Oh, Moomin.
1288560	1289560	Papa.
1289560	1291560	Oh, Moomin, my boy.
1291560	1293560	Where were you hiding?
1293560	1295560	In there.
1295560	1297560	In the hat?
1305560	1309560	Let's hope it's the last we'll see of it.
1309560	1313560	Moomin Papa decided that although it was a fine hat,
1313560	1315560	it was too dangerous to keep.
1315560	1319560	So Moomin threw it in the river and it floated away.
1319560	1321560	He wasn't too sure about it though,
1321560	1325560	because it was a rather special hat.
1345560	1349560	The Moomin's are having fun day after day.
1349560	1351560	The Moomin's.
1351560	1355560	The Moomin's.
1355560	1359560	They love the laughter and they love the living.
1359560	1363560	The Moomin's.
1363560	1369560	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.
1369560	1373560	They're always happy and goes at play.
1373560	1377560	The Moomin's are having fun day after day.
1377560	1381560	The Moomin's.
1381560	1385560	The Moomin's.
1385560	1391560	The Moomin's.
1403560	1407560	Here they are for one and all.
1407560	1411560	The Moomin's are about to call.
1411560	1415560	Come on and sit down here with me.
1415560	1419560	They're here for you on your TV.
1419560	1423560	They are the Moomin's.
1423560	1427560	They are the Moomin's.
1427560	1431560	So come with me, give me your hand.
1431560	1435560	You can fly just like a bird.
1435560	1437560	Sing that song ever.
1437560	1441560	There were the Moomin's.
1441560	1445560	There were the Moomin's.
1445560	1449560	There were the Moomin's.
1449560	1453560	There were the Moomin's.
1453560	1457560	There were the Moomin's.
1457560	1463560	There were the Moomin's.
1463560	1467560	There were the Moomin's.
1467560	1471560	There were the Moomin's.
1471560	1475560	There were the Moomin's.
1475560	1479560	There were the Moomin's.
1479560	1483560	There were the Moomin's.
1483560	1489560	There were the Moomin's.
1489560	1493560	There were the Moomin's.
1493560	1497560	There were the Moomin's.
1497560	1501560	There were the Moomin's.
1501560	1505560	There were the Moomin's.
1505560	1509560	Snuffkin is put up his tent on the riverbank.
1509560	1512560	He likes being on his own and has decided to stay there until winter comes.
1512560	1516560	Snuffkin is a happy and a peace with the world.
1516560	1522560	Moomin loves to spend as much time as he can as a friend as Snuffkin.
1522560	1524560	Snuffkin?
1524560	1526560	Snuffkin?
1526560	1528560	Where are you?
1528560	1532560	He must have forgotten I was coming and gone off somewhere.
1532560	1536560	How can he enjoy being here on his own?
1536560	1538560	I'd like to be alone now and then you know.
1538560	1540560	Oh, silly, let's go and explore.
1540560	1541560	Maiden.
1541560	1543520	But we said we'd go today.
1543520	1545200	Yeah, we did too, Moomin.
1545200	1547480	You are the one that said it, you know.
1547480	1548480	Hmm, you did.
1548480	1549560	I didn't.
1549560	1550760	You did too.
1550760	1552200	Oh, you must come.
1552200	1554960	We're going to collect shells on the beach.
1554960	1556280	Come on, it'll be fun.
1556280	1557120	Oh, no.
1561120	1562440	Hey.
1562440	1564160	It's sniff.
1564160	1565960	Where are you guys going?
1565960	1568360	Oh, I envy Snuffkin.
1568360	1569400	Oh, why?
1569400	1571120	I just do.
1571120	1573960	I wonder where Snuffkin has gone.
1573960	1583600	I wonder if we'll ever find anything as exciting as the hat.
1583600	1586200	Yeah, it was very special that hat.
1586200	1588320	Did you really throw it in the river?
1588320	1589320	Yeah.
1589320	1590760	I wish you hadn't.
1590760	1592880	It was much too dangerous to keep.
1592880	1595400	Look at the horrible things it did to me.
1595400	1597720	But what about the eggshells it turned into clouds?
1597720	1600400	Yeah, it was good fun flying around.
1600400	1603280	Perhaps I'll find the nicer with a huge pearl inside.
1603280	1633280	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
1633280	1663280	What? What's happened? We were playing tag and she fell into an ant lion hole. We've got to get her out quickly. Come on, moving. Nearly there is North Maiden just a bit further. Help me, sniff. Give me your hand. Hurry! Look out! It's the ant lion! Look what you're doing to my hole. I'm sorry. I'll be out soon. Stop yelling and kicking like that. You're scaring off my prey.
1663280	1693280	Are you all right, Snark Maiden? I can't reach her. I don't have to have ants for lunch, you know. Don't be a woman, please. You better get in there, sniff. What? Me? Don't worry. I'll hold on to you. You're the only one tall enough, sniff. Come on. You look nice and tasty. I'll eat you and step. Good, sniff. Look, I'm getting there. You're big.
1693280	1701280	Don't you call me a big whip? You gotta grab hold of me. I'll work for you.
1709280	1711280	Thank you. Are you ready? Hold tight.
1711280	1717280	Come on, nearly a bit.
1741280	1753280	Where have you been, self-kin? That's a big secret, movement. I won't tell anyone.
1753280	1757280	All right. It's the magic hat. It's on a sandbank further down the river.
1757280	1763280	Gosh! But something terrible is happening. What? What is it?
1763280	1775280	Oh dear, perhaps we shouldn't have thrown it in the river. It's too late now. Let's get there, Cookie.
1775280	1787280	There it is. It's caught on a branch in the middle.
1787280	1793280	Where? Oh, Smurfkin. I can see it. Look at the water. It's all red.
1793280	1797280	Hmm. Seems to be coming from the hat. I wonder what it is, move.
1797280	1803280	I'll go and get it. Be careful. Shall I come too?
1803280	1813280	No, you stay there. Have you got it? Uh-huh.
1834280	1840280	Wow! It's raspberry juice. What should we do with the hat?
1840280	1845280	Well, I don't think it's a good idea to leave it lying around. Somebody might crawl into it.
1845280	1849280	But if we put water in it, we can have as much raspberry juice as we can drink.
1849280	1856280	Well, that would be nice. But you know, movement. It could only be river water that does that. You know what I mean, movement?
1856280	1863280	Well, I think it's worth experimenting.
1875280	1881280	What's the matter, Mullen? You look very tired. I woke up in the night and couldn't get back to sleep.
1881280	1886280	Pardon? Couldn't get back to sleep. Huh. What are you talking about?
1886280	1892280	I was awake last night too. And I know why you're so tired.
1892280	1898280	You must have been dreaming. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in a hurry. Thanks, mama.
1898280	1902280	Where are you going, movement? Movement!
1902280	1906280	Somewhere you can't come. Somewhere private.
1906280	1909280	So, what was that all about, huh?
1909280	1914280	Oh, nothing really important, movement, papa.
1914280	1916280	I think I'll go out.
1924280	1929280	Ha-ha. Nobody hides anything from little, my.
1929280	1936280	Snopkin!
1936280	1943280	Hey, I found out who's had it is. Who's?
1943280	1945280	The Hobgoblins. The Hobgoblins.
1945280	1950280	Yeah, I asked the emulant and he told me that he saw him once long ago wearing that.
1950280	1953280	I heard about the wizard who flies in the sky.
1953280	1958280	Yeah, on the back of a black panther. The Hobgoblins is hundreds of years old and cares only for rubies.
1958280	1965280	He rides all over the world, searching for them. He's truly awesome.
1965280	1968280	And so, when he dropped his hat?
1968280	1972280	He must have been looking for some rubies right here in Moomin Valley.
1972280	1975280	Do you think he's got a lot of hats, Snopkin?
1975280	1977280	Gee, I don't know.
1977280	1980280	Well, do you think perhaps he doesn't know where he dropped his hat?
1980280	1983280	Yeah, I suppose that's possible.
1983280	1987280	Snopkin, there's something I would like to try with the hat.
1987280	1994280	Just don't put it on. Will you?
1994280	1999280	He's in there somewhere. Hat lions are pretty stupid, you know.
1999280	2003280	Yes, Moomin Papa told me it takes him hours to take themselves into the sand.
2003280	2006280	Oh, no, it doesn't. It only takes the one hour.
2006280	2008280	Only an hour? You're kidding.
2008280	2012280	Well, of course, an hour is a long time to spend, digging.
2012280	2014280	Are you talking about me?
2014280	2019280	Yes, about how quickly you could dig yourself into a hole in the sand.
2019280	2022280	A lot quicker than you think it'll take.
2022280	2026280	Moomin here says it takes you only one hour to dig a hole in the sand.
2026280	2029280	But I can't believe that.
2029280	2032280	Snopkin says it takes several hours, but I think he's wrong.
2032280	2035280	I'll show you how long.
2035280	2038280	Gosh, that was rather fast.
2038280	2042280	Yeah, but it's obvious he's already got a ready-made hole hidden there.
2042280	2045280	Don't you, Aunt Lion.
2045280	2048280	No, I do not.
2048280	2053280	I can dig myself in anywhere, anywhere at all.
2058280	2060280	How about here?
2060280	2063280	Yeah, okay. Under this rock. All right?
2063280	2065280	Anywhere. Just show me.
2065280	2067280	Okay, start from here.
2067280	2069280	Yeah, just there, if you don't mind.
2070280	2072280	All right, start counting.
2076280	2079280	Wow, you only took a second and a half.
2079280	2081280	He's really something, isn't he?
2081280	2083280	He certainly is.
2083280	2085280	I'd better sit on it.
2085280	2088280	Yeah, he'll be really mad.
2100280	2104280	So you've caught the Aunt Lion. I've been watching.
2104280	2105280	Little boy.
2105280	2106280	Right.
2106280	2109280	Did you follow us last night?
2109280	2110280	Yes.
2110280	2112280	Did you tell the others?
2112280	2115280	Oh, don't be silly, you guys. I haven't said a word yet.
2115280	2118280	But you will if we don't let you join in with us.
2118280	2120280	That's what she's doing, Moomin.
2120280	2122280	No, as if I do such a thing.
2122280	2126280	Of course, I'm forgetting how nice and kind you are.
2127280	2129280	Hey, what is that?
2137280	2139280	Nope, no hat anywhere.
2145280	2147280	There's gallons of water.
2147280	2151280	Gosh, there sure must be a lot of sand in there.
2151280	2154280	He must have changed into something else by now.
2154280	2155280	Probably.
2156280	2159280	It must have been long enough. I'll jump off.
2161280	2165280	He isn't strong enough to move the rock by himself.
2165280	2166280	Shall we help him?
2166280	2167280	No, don't.
2167280	2169280	Come on, let's do it.
2173280	2175280	What's happened to him?
2175280	2177280	Let's turn it over.
2177280	2180280	Oh, no, I can't look.
2186280	2187280	Oh.
2200280	2202280	It's a hedgehog.
2204280	2206280	It's a hedgehog.
2206280	2208280	It's a hedgehog.
2209280	2210280	You.
2213280	2214280	What?
2214280	2215280	You're a hedgehog.
2217280	2218280	Yeah.
2235280	2236280	Moomin.
2239280	2241280	I'll stop it.
2241280	2243280	Don't push me a little bit.
2243280	2244280	Why?
2244280	2245280	Moomin.
2269280	2271280	Moomin.
2271280	2273280	I just saw the hobgoblin.
2273280	2274280	What?
2274280	2276280	It must have been him.
2276280	2278280	Do you think he was looking for his hat?
2278280	2279280	I'm afraid so.
2279280	2281280	I hope you hit it well.
2281280	2282280	The seller.
2283280	2285280	Will it be safe there?
2286280	2289280	Well, only little my and us two know where it is.
2289280	2290280	Hmm.
2298280	2300280	The red?
2303280	2307280	I wonder if it's possible to change it into spaghetti.
2313280	2315280	Huh?
2320280	2322280	Hmm.
2322280	2324280	Not exactly spaghetti.
2329280	2330280	Mama!
2330280	2331280	Mama!
2332280	2335280	There's something I think you ought to know.
2335280	2336280	What is it, dear?
2336280	2339280	There are strange things happening in the house.
2339280	2340280	In the house?
2340280	2342280	There's a tree in the seller.
2342280	2343280	A tree?
2343280	2345280	That's nice.
2346280	2350280	What did you say, a real tree?
2351280	2354280	Yes, and it seems to be growing and growing.
2354280	2356280	What have you done, little my?
2356280	2359280	Just dropped a bit of thread into the magic hat.
2359280	2361280	But Moomin threw it away.
2361280	2362280	Yeah, we did.
2362280	2365280	But we sort of found it again and put it in the seller.
2365280	2366280	Oh, dear.
2366280	2370280	We must tell Moomin Papa before it's too late.
2371280	2373280	Come in.
2373280	2375280	It's not locked.
2379280	2381280	Keep going, tree.
2381280	2383280	You can grow as big as you like.
2383280	2386280	And just tell me if you're thirsty or anything.
2390280	2392280	And how about some fruit soon?
2392280	2394280	I really like pears.
2395280	2398280	Come in.
2398280	2401280	I'm very sorry to disturb you, Papa.
2401280	2403280	What is it?
2403280	2405280	Well, it's not good.
2405280	2408280	What do you mean, not good?
2408280	2411280	I think you'd better come down and have a look at once.
2411280	2415280	So you can see for yourself what's happening before it's too late.
2415280	2417280	Too late?
2417280	2419280	Oh, that sounds a bit ominous.
2419280	2422280	Don't worry, I'll sort it out whatever the catastrophe.
2425280	2427280	Now, listen you.
2427280	2431280	You leave my husband's desk alone or you'll be sorry.
2431280	2433280	All right, dear.
2433280	2435280	I'm coming.
2435280	2436280	Oh.
2436280	2438280	Well, this is definitely a catastrophe.
2438280	2441280	I think you'd better get me a saw, Mama.
2441280	2443280	Oh, sure.
2443280	2447280	Everything's in the seller and it would be a bit difficult to get in there now, Moomin Papa.
2447280	2448280	They'll never mind.
2448280	2450280	We haven't got time.
2450280	2452280	I'll break them by hand.
2455280	2457280	Oh.
2469280	2471280	Gee, look at Moomin house.
2471280	2472280	Come on, Snork Maiden.
2472280	2474280	This is fun.
2474280	2476280	But what happened, little Mai?
2476280	2478280	I've been gardening that tall.
2478280	2480280	Aren't I clever?
2481280	2483280	Whoo!
2487280	2490280	Well, this catastrophe is going on too long.
2490280	2491280	I'm hungry.
2491280	2492280	Oh.
2492280	2494280	Look on the bright side, Papa.
2494280	2497280	It could be a long time before we run out of firewood.
2497280	2498280	There.
2498280	2499280	Take that.
2499280	2500280	Oh, oh.
2500280	2503280	Dad will teach you to try and take over Moomin house.
2504280	2511280	Papa, look at all these lovely flowers.
2514280	2516280	And fruit.
2519280	2522280	Papa, Papa, you must try some.
2522280	2525280	Oh, they're lovely and juicy.
2529280	2531280	Oh, no.
2531280	2534280	Little Mai must have put something into the hat.
2540280	2542280	Moomin, where are you, Moomin?
2542280	2543280	Moomin.
2543280	2544280	Here I am.
2544280	2549280	Oh, Moomin, I was afraid that you were inside the house.
2549280	2552280	Mama, Papa, little Mai.
2552280	2554280	They can't get out.
2554280	2556280	We'll need some saws and axes.
2556280	2558280	They must all be in the cellar and we can't get in this way.
2558280	2560280	We must try and find another way.
2560280	2562280	All right, I'll run and get some help.
2562280	2564280	You do not have to, little one.
2571280	2573280	Are you the hobgoblin, sir?
2573280	2574280	I am he.
2574280	2577280	I can see that you have found my hat.
2577280	2578280	Yes, sir.
2578280	2580280	It was on top of the mountain.
2580280	2582280	I think the...
2582280	2585280	That tree seems to be doing remarkably well.
2586280	2588280	However, away with thee.
2605280	2606280	Oh, my God.
2606280	2608280	Goodness be, I hope.
2608280	2610280	Oh, my God.
2616280	2621280	Oh, that really is some hat you have there, Mr. Hobgoblin.
2621280	2623280	I'm sorry, I troubled you.
2623280	2627280	We're just glad you came along when you did, Mr. Hobgoblin.
2627280	2629280	You're most kind, madam.
2629280	2633280	I don't suppose you'd have any uncommonly large rubies here, would you?
2633280	2636280	You finding my hat here must be an omen.
2639280	2642280	Here you are, Mr. Hobgoblin.
2642280	2645280	My husband, Moomin Papa, gave it to me.
2648280	2651280	It is fine indeed, and you are lucky to have it.
2651280	2655280	But I'm afraid it is not the King's Ruby I am looking for.
2655280	2657280	What do you mean, King's Ruby?
2657280	2660280	I have searched for it for hundreds of years, Moomin Mama.
2660280	2664280	I'm afraid I am obsessed by it and cannot find it anywhere.
2664280	2667280	Well, if we see it, we'll light a signal fire.
2667280	2669280	You are mosted kind, madam.
2669280	2672280	And I feel we shall meet again soon.
2684280	2687280	He's not bad for a Hobgoblin.
2690280	2694280	Come on, everybody. Let's start stacking up all this wood.
2694280	2696280	Okay, let's do it.
2696280	2698280	Come on.
2709280	2714280	And so the Hobgoblin's hat finally disappeared from Moomin Valley.
2714280	2718280	Moomin rather missed having an ever-ending supply of raspberry juice,
2718280	2722280	but his parents were more than happy that it had gone.
2723280	2732280	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
2732280	2739280	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
2739280	2743280	They're always happy and always at play.
2743280	2750280	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
2750280	2760280	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
2760280	2768280	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
2768280	2772280	They're always happy and always at play.
2772280	2779280	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
2779280	2783280	The movements.
2783280	2789280	The movements.
2789280	2793280	The movements.
2820280	2824280	The movements.
2824280	2829280	The movements.
2829280	2833280	I'll take you up to Moomin land.
2833280	2837280	You can fly just like a bird.
2837280	2839280	Sing that song ever.
2839280	2843280	There were the movements.
2843280	2847280	There were the movements.
2847280	2851280	There were the movements.
2851280	2855280	There were the movements.
2878280	2902280	The sun is shining and Moomin Valley is enjoying its usual peace and tranquility.
2902280	2903280	Wait a minute.
2903280	2906280	Moomin Valley is enjoying its usual peace and tranquility.
2906280	2908280	Who's this?
2908280	2910280	Wait for me, Moomin!
2915280	2917280	Mama! Mama!
2917280	2919280	Are they ready?
2919280	2920280	Are what ready?
2920280	2921280	The pancakes!
2921280	2924280	Not yet. This hobgoblin wood doesn't seem to burn very well.
2924280	2925280	Aren't they cooking?
2925280	2928280	They won't be long. Have some lemonade while you're waiting.
2928280	2931280	Mama! Are the pancakes ready yet?
2931280	2934280	Oh well. Everything seems normal in the Moomin house.
2935280	2939280	I'm a dumbo, I'm a no-good-me-goboot-niny.
2939280	2942280	No, you're not, Snork. You're very clever.
2942280	2946280	No, I'm a failure of floppy, frightful fraud and a misfit.
2946280	2950280	But your landship was a success? Wasn't it?
2950280	2952280	Kid stuff!
2952280	2955280	Look, if you can make a ship that runs on land,
2955280	2958280	then I'm sure you can make one that flies. I believe in you.
2958280	2962280	Fat lot of good, that does me, Snork and Maiden.
2963280	2966280	You know, last night I thought,
2966280	2970280	I'd done it, a fly ship, then I looked at it again.
2970280	2973280	No good, no good. It was all wrong.
2973280	2975280	Wouldn't, couldn't fly at all.
2975280	2979280	Or how could someone so intelligent be such an idiot?
2979280	2981280	Oh dear, oh dear.
2984280	2987280	Well, they're ready. Go and tell the others little Mai.
2987280	2989280	All right, Moomin, Mama.
2989280	2991280	Where's Moomin and Snork Maiden?
2991280	2993280	Snork Maiden's fallen again.
2995280	2997280	Come on, Snork Maiden, cheer up.
2997280	2999280	I'm sure Snork will get over it.
2999280	3002280	Inventors always feel down in the dumps when something doesn't work.
3002280	3004280	Does Moomin, Papa, do you think?
3004280	3007280	He invents stories. Doesn't he, Moomin?
3007280	3009280	Well, where Moomin was, really?
3009280	3012280	Snork Maiden, do you want some pancakes?
3012280	3014280	Oh, yes, please, Moomin, Mama.
3014280	3016280	Moomin, go and get Papa.
3016280	3019280	I have a feeling he's writing his gut stuck again.
3019280	3021280	Okay, Mama.
3021280	3024280	Now, what's the matter, Snork Maiden?
3027280	3030280	Well, the sun returned to the eastern sky when morning came
3030280	3032280	and everything started to get lighter and lighter.
3032280	3034280	Oh dear, everybody knows that.
3034280	3038280	Even the stupidest retard, really.
3038280	3041280	I have absolutely no literary talent.
3041280	3044280	I'm an ignoramus son, a literate dilatant,
3044280	3046280	nor an illiterate idiot.
3046280	3048280	It's high time I gave up writing.
3048280	3050280	Oh.
3050280	3052280	Yes?
3052280	3053280	Papa?
3053280	3055280	Yeah, what is it, Moomin?
3055280	3059280	Uh, Mama said to tell you the pancakes are ready.
3059280	3063280	Well, I can't stop now. I'm being creative. I'll eat later.
3063280	3065280	Oh, really?
3065280	3067280	Yes, anything else?
3067280	3070280	Yeah, no. I thought you said something.
3078280	3080280	Moomin, wait, I'm coming.
3087280	3089280	That was really good, Moomin, Mama.
3089280	3091280	I'm going out.
3091280	3092280	I'm coming.
3092280	3093280	No, you can't.
3093280	3095280	Snuffkin and I are going on an adventure
3095280	3097280	and it could be dangerous.
3103280	3105280	Nice, Snuffkin.
3105280	3107280	Hello, Moomin. Didn't think you were coming.
3107280	3109280	Sorry, I'm late. What's that?
3109280	3110280	A leaf boat.
3110280	3113280	Look, it sails on the river just like a real one.
3116280	3118280	I bet it goes all the way down to the sea
3118280	3120280	and maybe even to some foreign lands.
3120280	3123280	Gosh, Snuffkin, I'd like to do that one day.
3123280	3125280	Let's go then, shall we?
3125280	3129280	Little Mai wanted to come, but I told her it was too dangerous.
3129280	3132280	Hmm, perhaps that wasn't the best thing to say.
3132280	3134280	Look.
3135280	3137280	I thought they could use a bit of fun.
3137280	3139280	Wait, Moomin.
3146280	3149280	Are we really going to climb up there?
3149280	3151280	Look, I don't think we can all go.
3151280	3153280	It'll just be Moomin and me.
3153280	3155280	I'm not climbing up there.
3155280	3157280	Well, I am.
3157280	3159280	Wouldn't you like to keep me company instead?
3159280	3162280	Look, there's a cave just a little bit further along this path.
3163280	3165280	Why don't you two girls wait for us there?
3165280	3166280	We won't be long.
3166280	3169280	But if you can walk to it, why on earth climb to it?
3169280	3172280	Ah, difficult for a girl to understand.
3172280	3175280	Well, I think boys are difficult to understand.
3175280	3177280	We're not sure we can reach it from above.
3177280	3179280	Well, we'll soon find out.
3179280	3181280	Are you coming with us, Snuff?
3181280	3183280	Oh, I think I'll guard the rear.
3183280	3185280	Protect the cave from below.
3185280	3187280	Oh, yeah.
3187280	3190280	Well, someone has to look after the girls.
3190280	3192280	Someone responsible.
3212280	3214280	Oh, my goodness, it's dark in there.
3214280	3215280	Let's go in, then.
3215280	3217280	I don't like the look of it.
3217280	3219280	We'd better stay out here.
3219280	3221280	You never know who might live in there.
3221280	3222280	Don't be silly.
3222280	3224280	No one lives in there.
3224280	3225280	That's what I don't like.
3225280	3229280	Yes, exactly a place with no one living in it is really scary.
3233280	3236280	I think we must be right above the cave here.
3236280	3237280	Maybe.
3237280	3239280	I can't find a hole, though.
3239280	3242280	Let's look a bit more over that way, Moomin.
3243280	3247280	Wow, I've never seen a shell like this before.
3247280	3249280	Oh, look at that one.
3249280	3251280	They must be worth a fortune.
3251280	3253280	Come over here and look, Little Mai.
3255280	3257280	Where's Little Mai, Snork maidens?
3257280	3259280	She went into the cave, Snuff.
3259280	3261280	Oh, no, she can't do that.
3261280	3263280	It might be dangerous.
3266280	3267280	Little Mai!
3267280	3268280	Little Mai!
3268280	3269280	Come out!
3269280	3271280	No, you come in, scaredy cat.
3271280	3273280	You can't just go in like that.
3273280	3274280	You can't.
3274280	3278280	So tell me, how would you go in there and Mr. No at all?
3278280	3279280	Stay where you are.
3279280	3281280	We'll rescue you.
3281280	3284280	You're coming, too, aren't you, Snork maiden?
3284280	3286280	You can't stay here alone.
3286280	3288280	I suppose so.
3288280	3290280	What's that? Let's go.
3290280	3293280	Shall I hold your hand in case you get frightened?
3295280	3296280	Little Mai!
3296280	3298280	Where are you?
3298280	3299280	No!
3299280	3305280	Stop it, please. You're frightening Snork maiden.
3305280	3306280	Oh, really?
3306280	3307280	I thought I was frightening you.
3307280	3309280	Your voice is so shaky.
3309280	3312280	This is the way I sound normally.
3312280	3314280	Hey, be quiet.
3314280	3316280	No.
3316280	3318280	I can hear something.
3318280	3320280	Me, too.
3320280	3322280	Perhaps it's the wind.
3322280	3323280	No, Snork maiden.
3323280	3325280	It sounds like someone moaning.
3325280	3327280	You can't scare me like that.
3327280	3328280	No one lives here.
3328280	3329280	Who want to live here anyway?
3329280	3331280	It's dark and cold.
3331280	3333280	It's moment and snuffkin.
3333280	3336280	They've climbed down and we can hear their voices in the distance.
3336280	3338280	So we needn't worry.
3338280	3339280	Why would they be moaning?
3339280	3340280	No.
3340280	3342280	It's not them.
3342280	3345280	I'm going to go and investigate.
3349280	3351280	Don't, little Mai.
3351280	3353280	Please, please stop it.
3358280	3362280	Pull hard, Moomin.
3362280	3365280	Will this do?
3365280	3367280	Right, who's going first?
3367280	3368280	Me.
3368280	3370280	Okay, but please be careful.
3370280	3371280	I will.
3371280	3378280	Take it easy, Moomin.
3378280	3386280	There's no hurry.
3386280	3389280	Hey, are you alright, Moomin?
3389280	3393280	Yes, of course.
3393280	3400280	Oh, oh!
3400280	3407280	Ah, ah, ah!
3407280	3411280	Ah, ah, ah!
3411280	3416280	Ah, ah, ah!
3416280	3422280	Help me!
3422280	3425280	Woman! What's happened? Talk to me!
3425280	3427280	Woman! Are you all right?
3427280	3429280	Oh, I don't know. I think so.
3429280	3431280	My bottom's a little bit sore though.
3431280	3434280	I'm sure I heard somebody scream just now.
3434280	3437280	Well, the Himmelin was down here having a nap.
3437280	3438280	The Himmelin?
3438280	3441280	If this is another of your games, woman, I don't like it.
3441280	3444280	Mr. Himmelin, we were climbing down from the top.
3444280	3445280	We didn't know you were asleep.
3445280	3447280	That's not quite right. I wasn't asleep.
3447280	3449280	I wasn't the tall comfortable, you know.
3449280	3451280	Well, what were you doing here then?
3451280	3456280	Well, to tell you the truth, I really haven't been quite myself lately.
3456280	3460280	You haven't lost any more rare stabs, have you, Mr. Himmelin?
3460280	3463280	On the contrary, woman, I have them all.
3463280	3467280	Even the rarest, every single one.
3467280	3470280	Then what's wrong? That's good, isn't it?
3470280	3473280	I mean, my collection is complete.
3473280	3478280	No one in the world has a better stab collection than you have, Mr. Himmelin.
3478280	3482280	No, of course not mine is perfect. There isn't a stab I haven't got.
3482280	3486280	Rare ones, old ones, misprinted ones, I have them all.
3486280	3488280	I still don't understand.
3488280	3490280	There's no challenge, nothing to search for.
3490280	3493280	You're too young and you don't collect stamps.
3493280	3495280	Oh dear, me, dear me.
3495280	3498280	I'm beginning to understand.
3498280	3502280	He's not a collector anymore. He's got all the stamps he could ever want.
3502280	3506280	That's the trouble. It's not half as much fun.
3507280	3511280	That's why you're sad, isn't it, Mr. Himmelin?
3511280	3515280	Yes it is. Don't fun. Don't fun at all.
3515280	3518280	No, I understand. I can see why you're upset.
3518280	3521280	And me falling on top of you like that did it really help, did it?
3521280	3525280	Not exactly, Moomin.
3525280	3529280	Look who was taking a nap in the cave.
3529280	3531280	It's you, Mr. Himmelin.
3531280	3535280	So it must have been his snoring that we heard. What a noise he was making.
3536280	3539280	I'd never ever snore.
3539280	3542280	You certainly do.
3544280	3551280	Rubbish. Look, if you promise not to tell anyone, I'll take you to see something very special.
3551280	3553280	What is it?
3554280	3557280	Oh wait, it's not it.
3557280	3559280	It's not it.
3559280	3561280	It's not it.
3561280	3563280	It's not it.
3563280	3565280	It's not it.
3565280	3567280	It's not it.
3567280	3569280	It's not it.
3569280	3571280	It's not it.
3571280	3573280	I think it could be repaired.
3573280	3575280	Of course it could. Easy.
3575280	3579280	But you know you can't always tell. The keel doesn't look too good.
3579280	3582280	Yes, we could take it out to see a no time.
3582280	3584280	Sales got holes in it.
3584280	3587280	Hey, I can't find any owners.
3587280	3590280	You can pat a lost deer.
3590280	3593280	Look out, friends. It's going over.
3599280	3603280	Hey, hang on everybody.
3603280	3606280	I've lost my confidence and it makes me feel very unhappy.
3606280	3609280	Well, it can happen to anyone, you know.
3609280	3610280	Even to you?
3610280	3612280	Well, not much, of course.
3612280	3615280	Lucky you. I just don't know what to do.
3615280	3618280	How can I get it back? There must be a way.
3618280	3620280	It's hard to say.
3620280	3624280	Everybody's different, but with me it just happens.
3624280	3627280	Oh.
3627280	3630280	I don't think I'll ever invent anything again.
3630280	3633280	Perhaps I'll have a break from my memoirs, too.
3633280	3636280	Tea time? Oh dear, what's the matter with you, too?
3636280	3638280	You look a bit down in the dunes.
3638280	3641280	You know I might have been a bit overconfident.
3641280	3644280	Me, too, I think.
3644280	3648280	Oh, hi there.
3648280	3651280	Mom, what's the matter with you, too?
3651280	3653280	You look a bit down in the dunes.
3653280	3656280	You know I might have been a bit overconfident.
3656280	3659280	Mum and Mama! Mum and Papa!
3659280	3663280	There's no need to yell. We can hear you. Watch the matter, Sniff.
3663280	3667280	We found a boat on the beach. Come and have a look.
3667280	3670280	A shipwreck washed up on the shore.
3670280	3673280	It's not a wreck and it's got a white sail.
3673280	3674280	Oh.
3674280	3677280	We're going to repair it and then it'll be ours.
3677280	3680280	All right, I'm coming. Come on, Snork.
3680280	3684280	Let's take a look at this boat. It could be just the thing to cheer us both up.
3684280	3687280	Oh, it's got a sail, a white sail, you say.
3687280	3690280	That could be extremely interesting.
3693280	3696280	It's a sturdy little craft. It's nicely built.
3696280	3698280	Well designed.
3698280	3701280	She's abandoned. So does that mean we can keep her?
3707280	3710280	It seems to be in pretty good condition except for the hole in the bottom.
3710280	3713280	You know, maybe that's why she was abandoned here.
3714280	3716280	You could be right, Sniffkin.
3716280	3719280	Finders keepers, you guys. Of course it makes it our boat.
3719280	3722280	You'd have to wait to see if anyone claims it first, little mind.
3722280	3724280	What shall we do then, Papa?
3724280	3731280	Well, first things first, we must repair the hole and then tire up securely in case there's a storm.
3731280	3733280	Absolutely.
3733280	3738280	Then if the owner comes, we ought to give her back to him.
3738280	3741280	Mind you, he might know she's here.
3743280	3746280	So what are we going to do when we've repaired her?
3746280	3751280	It's bad for boats not to be yours, but we could sail the seven seas.
3755280	3758280	I'd be happy just to explore around here.
3758280	3763280	Don't worry, Snort Maiden. If we get big waves, we can sail between them, isn't that right?
3763280	3764280	Mom and Papa?
3764280	3769280	Well, in a way. Come on, let's get to work.
3769280	3772280	How about you, Snort? Will you help us?
3772280	3774280	Yes, of course.
3774280	3776280	Can I do anything for you, Mum and Papa?
3776280	3779280	Yes, if you'd like to, Mr. Himmelon.
3779280	3783280	Well, I'm afraid I'm not much of a builder, but if there is something I could do.
3783280	3786280	Well, let's get her out of the water first, shall we?
3786280	3788280	Yeah, mom!
3788280	3791280	And we'll need some big logs to go under her.
3791280	3794280	I think tin should be enough.
3794280	3797280	I'll be too soon. Let's go, prom!
3797280	3803280	Yes, you'll need to be safe to work on, so we'll want something strong to keep her upright as well.
3803280	3805280	And lots of tools.
3805280	3810280	I'll go home and get some, and I think we'll need a bucket and a shovel.
3810280	3813280	I'll come with you, help you, tools.
3813280	3818280	Yes, you go. I'll stay and keep guard in case the owner comes back.
3827280	3829280	Sleep well.
3841280	3843280	Man, the top sales.
3843280	3845280	What?
3858280	3861280	Are they all in bed, my dear?
3861280	3863280	Yes, dear, sleeping like logs.
3863280	3867280	I'm not surprised. They all work very, very hard today.
3867280	3871280	I can't wait until the boat's ready, and we can sail off somewhere.
3871280	3874280	My dear, we'll go anywhere in the world you like.
3874280	3878280	Anywhere at all, you've only got to say enough, we'll jolly-will-go.
3878280	3881280	It doesn't have to be far, dear.
3881280	3884280	Let's get to bed, too. We've got an early start of the morning.
3885280	3890280	Oh, intellectuals like me aren't used to this hard work.
3890280	3893280	Oh, I'm tired out, and I can hardly move.
3893280	3896280	Mama, I'd better put these tired legs to bed.
3896280	3900280	Good night, dear Moomin, Papa. This would be good for him, I think.
3900280	3904280	Oh, dear, oh, dear.
3904280	3908280	A perfect fit, if I may say so.
3908280	3910280	Well, now for the rest of her.
3910280	3912280	Right.
3912280	3916280	Look at me, Moomin. I'm doing the Tari.
3916280	3920280	I know, little Mai. I'm only doing where you can't reach.
3920280	3922280	Oh, all right, then.
3922280	3924280	Sniff you lazy land lever, bring me some more Tari.
3924280	3928280	Hey, no, I won't. Get it yourself, you lazy thing.
3928280	3930280	You wanted to do it.
3930280	3934280	I didn't want to carry Tari, though. And anyway, I'm doing the Tari.
3934280	3936280	I know, little Mai. I'm only doing where you can't reach.
3936280	3940280	Oh, all right, then. Sniff you lazy land lever, bring me some more Tari.
3940280	3943280	Tari, though. And anyway, I'm the painter.
3943280	3945280	Come on, hurry up.
3949280	3951280	Moomin, Mama, should I cut it all out?
3951280	3954280	Yes, please, not me.
3967280	3969280	Hey, feeling all right, Mr. Hemmielin?
3969280	3972280	Yes, thank you. You're fixing the boat very quickly.
3972280	3975280	Yeah, we sure are. I should be finished very soon.
3975280	3978280	Yes, I'm sure it will.
3978280	3982280	That's what I was afraid of. What shall I do then, Sniffkin?
3982280	3985280	Well, maybe you can start collecting something else. What you think?
3985280	3987280	Something else, like what?
3987280	3990280	Well, I don't know. Anything, really?
3990280	3991280	How about butterflies?
3991280	3995280	No, my second cousin does that, and he's a complete idiot.
3995280	3997280	It has to be something interesting.
3997280	3999280	Ornements? Ornements?
3999280	4001280	Yeah, you could collect those forever.
4001280	4002280	Not scientific.
4002280	4007280	Well, it's up to you, but I think you really ought to collect something, Mr. Hemmielin.
4014280	4017280	Mama! Mama!ed!
4018280	4021280	Mama, quick, hurry up. We're going to launch the new boat.
4021280	4024280	All right, wait for me. I'm coming.
4024280	4028280	The sail, you men, it is perfect, Mama. Come on!
4029280	4034280	Are you ready, everybody? I'll count to three, and then push as hard as you can.
4034280	4037280	One, two, three!
4038280	4039280	Oh!
4049280	4051280	Oh!
4053280	4057280	And so, with their new boat finally repaired and uncleaned,
4057280	4061280	Moomin and the others began to get very excited about their trip around the world.
4061280	4066280	Even Snork and Mr. Hemmielin were in unusually high spirits.
4066280	4068280	All aboard for a trial run.
4073280	4075280	I've decided what I'm going to collect.
4075280	4080280	Flowers, look, here's my first sample. It's a sweet fryer, Rosa Robiganosa.
4080280	4083280	That's great. Good for you.
4083280	4089280	Snork, Maiden, I just had a new idea for my flying ship.
4089280	4092280	I'm certain it'll work this time.
4092280	4094280	Of course it will, Snork. Good luck.
4094280	4099280	I'd better get on. All right, start paddling, everyone.
4099280	4102280	We'll be back soon, my dear Moomin, Mama.
4102280	4107280	Take as long as you like, Papa. I'll prepare something cold for when you get back.
4107280	4110280	One, two, one, two.
4110280	4114280	Away, away, into the deep blue yonder.
4114280	4118280	One, two, one, two.
4124280	4131280	They love the laughter, and they love the living, the Moomin's.
4131280	4138280	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.
4138280	4142280	They're always happy, and always at play.
4142280	4149280	The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin'sed.
4149280	4159280	They love the laughter, and they love the living, the Moomin's.
4159280	4167280	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.
4167280	4171280	They're always happy, and always at play.
4171280	4178280	The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.
4178280	4188280	The Moomin's, the Moomin's.
4188280	4210280	Here they are for one and all.
4210280	4213280	The Moomin's are about to call.
4213280	4216280	Come on and sit down here with me.
4216280	4221280	They're here for you on your TV. They are the Moomin's.
4221280	4224280	They are the Moomin's.
4224280	4227280	So come with me, give me your hand.
4227280	4230280	I'll take you up to Moomin land.
4230280	4233280	You can fly just like a bird.
4233280	4236280	Sing the best song ever.
4236280	4238280	They're with the Moomin's.
4238280	4241280	They're with the Moomin's.
4241280	4253280	They're with the Moomin's.
4253280	4263280	They're with the Moomin's.
4263280	4273280	They're with the Moomin's.
4273280	4302280	It was a lovely day, and Moomin, his family and friends,
4303280	4307280	decided to go for a trip in the boat they'd found washed up on the beach.
4307280	4313280	They didn't know where they were going, and thought it would be much more fun that way.
4313280	4316280	Mama, we're not going away forever, you know.
4316280	4317280	I hope not.
4317280	4319280	I don't think we'll need all these pots and pans.
4319280	4321280	It's best to be prepared at sea.
4321280	4323280	What do you mean?
4323280	4326280	Well, you'll only complain if you don't get a hot meal.
4326280	4327280	I never complain.
4327280	4331280	And you know how hungry the sea air made you all last timeed we went out on a boat.
4331280	4333280	You would have been glad of food then.
4333280	4336280	Hmm, you got to rough it a bit if you wanted adventure.
4336280	4342280	Yes, but it will be more fun with coffee and pancakes.
4342280	4353280	Aren't you too ready yet?
4353280	4355280	Hello, Moomin.
4355280	4357280	Hi, Snorkvagan.
4357280	4368280	Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
4368280	4370280	Must you use that ladder?
4370280	4371280	I'm all right.
4371280	4374280	Moomin, you're going to hurt yourself one of these days.
4374280	4375280	It's good practice.
4375280	4377280	It's Snork coming with us.
4377280	4382280	He says he hasn't got time for sailing boats at the moment.
4382280	4386280	I'd much rather a real sailing boat than a paper flying ship any day.
4386280	4389280	Are Mama and Papa ready yet?
4389280	4392280	They're packing a path of kitchen.
4392280	4395280	Oh, it's too full.
4395280	4397280	Have we got to take all that with us?
4397280	4401280	Uh, Mama thinks it's better to be safe than sorry and she's usually right.
4401280	4402280	Tell me, Moomin.
4402280	4404280	Where exactly are we going?
4404280	4406280	We haven't decided yet.
4406280	4407280	That's right.
4407280	4409280	Wait and see.
4409280	4410280	That's right.
4410280	4411280	Wait and see.
4411280	4437280	Mr. Hamulin.
4437280	4438280	Mr. Hamulin.
4439280	4442280	Have you found a rare plan for your collection yet?
4442280	4444280	Unfortunately not.
4444280	4446280	There are lots of these in Moomin Valley already.
4446280	4447280	Goodness.
4447280	4449280	Where are you taking all that?
4449280	4450280	We're going sailing.
4450280	4454280	How exciting, charting new seas and exploring desert islands.
4454280	4455280	Never know.
4455280	4461240	If I help
4469280	4473280	Captain the bridge!
4473280	4475280	Mount the yard arm!
4475280	4477280	Hankers away!
4477280	4478280	Sailors beware!
4478280	4480280	Slice the manbrace!
4480280	4482280	All hands on deck!
4482280	4484280	Full speed ahead!
4484280	4485280	Hey, Sniff.
4485280	4486280	Any sign of the movements?
4486280	4487280	Not yet.
4487280	4489280	It's a great day to go sailing.
4489280	4491280	I wonder where we're going.
4491280	4493280	I don't have any idea.
4493280	4496280	I don't actually like sailing.
4496280	4498280	Do you get sick?
4498280	4499280	Well, not really sick.
4499280	4500280	It's just that I can't swim.
4500280	4503280	And if it's rough, it frightens me and I panic a bit.
4503280	4505280	It looks like it's going to stay calm.
4505280	4506280	So don't worry.
4506280	4507280	Right.
4507280	4508280	That's the lot.
4508280	4509280	Now, all aboard.
4509280	4513280	Mama, little Mai, Sniffkin, Moomin, Snork Maiden,
4513280	4514280	and Mr. Hamulin.
4514280	4515280	It looks like it's going to stay calm.
4515280	4516280	So don't worry.
4516280	4517280	Right.
4517280	4518280	That's the lot.
4518280	4519280	Now, all aboard.
4519280	4524280	Mama, little Mai, Sniffkin, Moomin, Snork Maiden,
4525280	4527280	and Mr. Hamulin of course.
4527280	4529280	Isn't he a bit old for adventures?
4529280	4530280	Not at all.
4530280	4532280	No, Moomin Papa has promised to find a deserted island
4532280	4534280	where I shall search for rare plants.
4539280	4541280	No, no, no, no, no.
4547280	4549280	Come on, Sniff, hurry up.
4549280	4550280	There's no room.
4550280	4552280	Don't be silly, Sniff.
4552280	4553280	Of course there is.
4555280	4558280	It looks very full, almost thinking.
4558280	4560280	There's no way this boat could sink.
4560280	4562280	Now, come on, get him.
4562280	4563280	Oh.
4566280	4567280	Really?
4567280	4569280	I promise it'll be all right.
4569280	4570280	Won't it, Papa?
4570280	4573280	Well, if it stays like this, it will, Moomin.
4574280	4576280	I'll come next time.
4576280	4577280	Let's go, Moomin Papa.
4577280	4579280	He's just a scary cat.
4581280	4583280	We'll go without you then, Sniff.
4583280	4585280	I think that will be best.
4585280	4588280	Anyway, someone had better stay and look after Moomin House
4588280	4590280	and it might just as well be me.
4590280	4592280	That's very thoughtful of you.
4592280	4594280	There's a pancake on the kitchen table
4594280	4595280	that you can have for lunch.
4595280	4596280	Thank you, Moomin Papa.
4596280	4598280	Have a nice trip.
4603280	4605280	I wish Sniff had come.
4605280	4607280	He's a big softy.
4609280	4611280	Well, he's not very good at swimming
4611280	4613280	and he does eat rather a lot.
4634280	4636280	This is a life, isn't it, Mama?
4636280	4638280	It certainly is, dear.
4642280	4645280	Oh, look, not a breath of wind.
4645280	4647280	Shall I start rolling, Papa?
4647280	4650280	Yes, you'd better get Sniffkin to help you.
4650280	4652280	Aye-aye, Captain.
4654280	4656280	It's hardly moving.
4656280	4658280	You'll have to do better than that.
4658280	4660280	We're doing our best.
4660280	4662280	You too, Papa.
4662280	4663280	We're doing our best.
4663280	4665280	We're doing our best.
4665280	4666280	We're doing our best.
4666280	4668280	We're doing our best.
4668280	4669280	We're doing our best.
4670280	4673280	You too would be useless as galley slaves.
4673280	4675280	It's good that we're not then, isn't it?
4675280	4677280	So then, what's your excuse?
4677280	4679280	It's not easy rolling against the tide.
4679280	4681280	You try it.
4681280	4685280	No, dear, at this rate, I should be lucky to find one rare plant.
4685280	4689280	Well, Mr. Hamlin, you could always try collecting some seaweed instead.
4689280	4691280	There's plenty of that.
4691280	4693280	I have heard tales that if you whistle,
4693280	4696280	those who perished at sea will send you a wind.
4697280	4701280	Land! Hoi! Look, Moomin, Papa!
4703280	4706280	That's too small to be any good.
4710280	4712280	You're right.
4713280	4717280	Hey, look, Papa. We're moving again.
4717280	4719280	The tide's turned and the winds up.
4723280	4725280	What a beautiful island!
4725280	4727280	And a perfect place to land, too.
4727280	4731280	Oh, I bet this place has got some rare plants.
4731280	4733280	We'll be careful.
4733280	4734280	We'll be careful.
4734280	4735280	We'll be careful.
4735280	4736280	We'll be careful.
4736280	4737280	We'll be careful.
4737280	4738280	We'll be careful.
4738280	4741280	Oh, I bet this place has got some rare plants.
4741280	4743280	We'll be careful when you explore.
4743280	4745280	There could be wild animals there.
4745280	4747280	Now, if someone will go and collect some wood,
4747280	4749280	I'll get a fire started.
4749280	4753280	I bet none of you will say no to coffee and pancakes.
4753280	4755280	Watch me, you land lovers.
4755280	4757280	I'll go and pull the boat ashore.
4769280	4772280	Hmm, I suppose you were right.
4772280	4773280	This will come in handy.
4773280	4775280	As I said, Papa, it's always better to rough it
4775280	4777280	with a little bit of luxury.
4777280	4780280	I wonder if we're the first to set foot on the island.
4783280	4785280	Thank you, children.
4785280	4787280	Is there anything else you want us to do?
4787280	4789280	No, I don't think so.
4789280	4791280	Is it okay if I go explore the island?
4791280	4793280	Of course, off you go.
4793280	4795280	Coming, snort, Maida.
4795280	4797280	I'll stay and help Moomin Mama with the cooking.
4798280	4800280	Mama, you said we needed firewood.
4800280	4801280	Is this enough?
4801280	4803280	My goodness for a lot.
4807280	4810280	You know, I don't think anyone lives on this island.
4810280	4814280	I haven't seen anyone unless they're hiding in the bushes.
4814280	4816280	I've seen someone.
4816280	4817280	Oh yeah?
4817280	4818280	Who?
4818280	4819280	Well, they weren't very big.
4819280	4821280	What do you mean, this big?
4821280	4823280	Well, same as me.
4823280	4824280	What did they look like?
4824280	4827080	Sort of white and ghostly and not very friendly looking
4827080	4828080	either, Moomin.
4828080	4831080	Well, you probably just thought you saw something a little mic.
4831080	4833080	I did see them.
4833080	4834080	I did too.
4834080	4835080	Keep your hair on.
4835080	4837080	I'm not saying you didn't see anything.
4840080	4843080	Goodness, this is magnificent.
4843080	4845080	Oh, what a find.
4853080	4855080	And what's this?
4858080	4860080	Well, well, well.
4860080	4863080	I've never seen such rare and beautiful plants.
4888080	4889080	Oh.
4898080	4899080	Well, what's this?
4899080	4901080	Goodness, it's a perimeter.
4901080	4902080	Now, let's see.
4902080	4903080	Rain and storm.
4903080	4905080	Probably broken.
4913080	4914080	Oh, hello.
4914080	4916080	Who are you?
4916080	4917080	Oh, I see.
4917080	4919080	This is your perimeter, isn't it?
4919080	4920080	Now, watch it.
4920080	4922080	Mind you don't travel on those flowers, will you?
4926080	4928080	Oh, no, no, no.
4928080	4929080	They're coming to get me.
4929080	4930080	Don't go away.
4930080	4931080	Don't go away.
4934080	4937080	I think what little my saw was a hatty fatter.
4937080	4939080	They're not ghosts.
4939080	4940080	Are they snuffkin?
4940080	4942080	No, they look kind of like it,
4942080	4944080	but they're really harmless enough, Moomin.
4945080	4947080	Oh, leave me alone.
4947080	4948080	Oh, dear.
4948080	4949080	What on earth was that?
4949080	4951080	It sounded like Mr. Himulet.
4958080	4960080	Don't get away.
4960080	4962080	Oh, help me, please.
4975080	4976080	That's it.
4976080	4977080	That's what I saw.
4977080	4979080	It's Mr. Himulet.
4979080	4980080	Help!
4980080	4981080	Get me down.
4981080	4983080	Why are they after you, Mr. Himulet?
4983080	4984080	What'd you do to them?
4984080	4986080	I don't know.
4986080	4988080	I just tapped on this post,
4988080	4990080	and asked them to be careful with the flowers.
4990080	4992080	They seem a bit angry to me.
4992080	4994080	Oh, then I tapped on them.
4994080	4996080	Oh, no, no, no.
4996080	4997080	I just tapped on this post,
4997080	4999080	and asked them to be careful with the flowers.
4999080	5000080	Is that ours?
5000080	5001080	They seem a bit angry to me.
5001080	5003080	Oh, then I tapped on them.
5003080	5004080	Oh, then I tapped on the morometer
5004080	5006080	to check the weather, and they came at me.
5006080	5008080	Well, I don't think it's a flower's a mad about.
5008080	5011080	Maybe they thought you were trying to steal the morometer.
5011080	5013080	I don't want it to keep it.
5013080	5016080	My goodness, I'm collecting flowers, not the morometers.
5016080	5018080	Well, hang on.
5018080	5020080	I can't hang on much longer.
5020080	5021080	Hurry, please.
5021080	5023080	They don't look so easily frightened.
5023080	5025080	No, now let me think.
5025080	5028080	Hurry, I'm slipping.
5030080	5032080	I've got it, Mr. Himulet.
5032080	5035080	The hadifatners can't see or hear very well,
5035080	5037080	but they are very sensitive.
5037080	5039080	We'll have to try and frighten them.
5039080	5042080	I suggest you shake the post as hard as you can.
5042080	5044080	Like this.
5044080	5045080	Harder.
5045080	5049080	Harder, Mr. Himulet.
5049080	5051080	Look, they can feel the ground moving.
5051080	5055080	Keep going, Mr. Himulet.
5055080	5059080	I'm getting really tired.
5060080	5062080	They're not going.
5062080	5065080	Are you sure this will work?
5081080	5084080	You can stop now, Mr. Himulet.
5084080	5087080	Mr. Himulet.
5087080	5090080	Hey, are you all right, Mr. Himulet?
5090080	5093080	What is disgusting creatures?
5093080	5096080	I have a good mind to take their precious barometer.
5096080	5099080	I don't think that's such a good idea.
5099080	5102080	It's no good anyway, it's not working.
5102080	5105080	How do you know that, Mr. Himulet?
5105080	5108080	Look, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?
5108080	5112080	According to this barometer, it should be pouring down with rain.
5113080	5118080	This is the way to explore real home cooking.
5118080	5120080	It just takes a little thought.
5120080	5124080	And woman papa is always prepared, aren't you dear?
5124080	5128080	Double zero, it can't get any lower than that.
5128080	5129080	What does that mean?
5129080	5133080	If it was working, it would mean being for a terrible storm.
5133080	5139080	I think the reading might be right after all, Mr. Himulet.
5140080	5143080	See the way the sky is darkening.
5148080	5150080	Look at those storm clouds.
5150080	5152080	We better go before it's too late.
5152080	5154080	But there won't be time to get home.
5154080	5156080	We'll be shipwreck moving, papa.
5156080	5158080	Surely there's still time.
5158080	5161080	We don't want to go back to moving valley yet.
5161080	5164080	We've only explored half the island.
5164080	5167080	Besides, you never know what we might find, Snort Maiden.
5167080	5170080	I wanted to get my hands on those happy fat nurse.
5170080	5173080	That's the last thing I wanted to do, little mind. The very last.
5173080	5175080	I think we ought to leave now.
5175080	5177080	What do you think, mama?
5177080	5180080	Well, you're the captain, dear. It's up to you.
5180080	5183080	So I am. Now, let me think.
5198080	5200080	All right, we'll stay.
5200080	5201080	Oh, can we?
5201080	5204080	Yes, but we must put the tent up before it starts raining.
5204080	5205080	What tent?
5205080	5209080	Always be prepared. That's my motto.
5209080	5212080	You're very clever to think of everything.
5213080	5218080	First, we must lower the sails and pull the boat up so that she's out of harm's way.
5218080	5221080	Yes, but we must put the tent up before it starts raining.
5221080	5222080	What tent?
5222080	5225080	Always be prepared. That's my motto.
5225080	5228080	The boat up so that she's out of harm's way.
5244080	5245080	That should do it.
5247080	5251080	Well done, everybody. It should be safe here.
5251080	5255080	Now, hurry with the tent. The storm's nearly here.
5257080	5259080	Are you all right, Mr. Himulan?
5259080	5261080	You stay here and rest.
5261080	5263080	We'll manage without you.
5263080	5265080	I am a bit tired.
5265080	5270080	You get your breath back first, but don't forget to tie the boat to that tree before you come up.
5270080	5273080	It looks bad. A real humdinger.
5273080	5275080	You can trust me.
5277080	5279080	Right, let's get that tent up.
5280080	5282080	Oh, dear, what a day.
5296080	5298080	Oh, what's this here?
5302080	5305080	Oh, yes.
5306080	5309080	Well, fans, see that I've never seen one of these before.
5316080	5317080	It's not good.
5320080	5321080	What's happening?
5321080	5325080	It's coming really fast. Look at the rain over the sea.
5326080	5328080	We're going to get soaked if we stay here.
5328080	5329080	Just a minute.
5330080	5331080	But we'll get wet.
5332080	5334080	I know, but it's so exciting.
5335080	5337080	Things which you have no control over.
5337080	5340080	You can see this great big storm coming towards you.
5340080	5342080	And you can't do anything about it.
5344080	5345080	No.
5345080	5347080	You have to time it just right.
5349080	5351080	When to make a run for shelter, you mean?
5352080	5354080	I knew you'd understand.
5359080	5361080	I wonder what the Hattie Fatterners are doing.
5361080	5363080	Waiting for the thunderstorm.
5363080	5364080	Why?
5365080	5368080	Because they get energy from the electricity and the lightning.
5368080	5369080	Really?
5370080	5371080	That's it.
5371080	5372080	Come on.
5390080	5392080	I've never seen rain like this.
5392080	5394080	I've never seen enough, Momen.
5396080	5397080	You're dressed, Mom.
5397080	5398080	I know.
5401080	5402080	It's all right.

5457080	5458080	I know.
5458080	5459080	I know.
5459080	5460080	That was a close one.
5460080	5461080	Too close.
5461080	5463080	I think it's over, Snork Maiden.
5463080	5466080	What a find I made today.
5466080	5468080	What a find I made today.
5468080	5470080	What a find I made today.
5479080	5482080	What a find I made today.
5482080	5485080	What you find It was I made today.
5485080	5488080	What a find I made today.
5488080	5490080	What a find I made today.
5490080	5491080	What a find Hai.
5491080	5493080	What a find I made today.
5493080	5495080	What the see my time is.
5495080	5498080	What you can do is wait until it's blown itself out.
5499080	5502080	But what if the waves are so high that your boat is caught up
5502080	5504080	and washed out to sea?
5504080	5507080	That is a different story altogether.
5507080	5513080	What if the waves are so high that your boat is caught up?
5538080	5541080	They're always happy and always at play.
5541080	5545080	The movements are having fun day after day.
5545080	5549080	The movements.
5549080	5553080	The movements.
5553080	5556080	They love the laughter and they love the living.
5556080	5560080	The movements.
5560080	5567080	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
5567080	5571080	They're always happy and always at play.
5571080	5575080	The movements are having fun day after day.
5575080	5578080	The movements.
5578080	5582080	The movements.
5582080	5588080	The movements.
5590080	5594080	The movements.
5621080	5624080	They are the movements.
5624080	5627080	So come with me, give me your hand.
5627080	5630080	I'll take you up to a moment land.
5630080	5633080	You can fly just like a bird.
5633080	5635080	Sing the bass song ever.
5635080	5638080	There were the movements.
5638080	5641080	There were the movements.
5641080	5644080	There were the movements.
5644080	5647080	There were the movements.
5647080	5650080	There were the movements.
5650080	5653080	There were the movements.
5677080	5680080	There were the movements.
5680080	5683080	There were the movements.
5683080	5686080	The movements.
5708080	5713080	Papa, I think that rope is getting loose.
5713080	5714080	Okay, movement.
5714080	5718080	You'd better have a look before this wind has the whole tent down.
5718080	5721080	The eye, Captain.
5721080	5725080	A sudden storm has hit the hafifat in this island.
5725080	5735080	The movement, Papa, has decided that it would be far safer to stay the night on the island.
5735080	5739080	So they put up the tent and moored the boat.
5748080	5751080	This will show us what the weather's up to.
5751080	5753080	That's as long as it's still working.
5753080	5756080	I'm sure it's going to die down really soon.
5756080	5758080	Oh, wake up, Mr. Hemelon.
5758080	5763080	When the storm clears, we must give this barometer straight back to the hafifat in this.
5763080	5767080	Oh, I quite fancy keeping it myself to remind me of the island.
5767080	5770080	You know, it seems to work after all.
5770080	5774080	But Mr. Hemelon, that'll only remind you of the horrible hafifat in this.
5774080	5777080	What about all the tons of plants you found?
5777080	5780080	That surely is going to be enough?
5780080	5786080	Yes, I know, but there was only really one special flower amongst all those plants, and I nearly missed that one.
5786080	5788080	Look, isn't it a beauty?
5788080	5791080	I discovered it as I was about to tie up the boat.
5791080	5794080	Oh, woman, Papa.
5794080	5796080	Yes, Mr. Hemelon.
5796080	5802080	You know, when you all went to put up the tent, you told me to tie up the boat so she was safe.
5802080	5804080	Yes, of course.
5804080	5807080	Well, I'm not sure if I did.
5807080	5809080	Not sure at all.
5810080	5813080	Please try to remember, Mr. Hemelon.
5813080	5817080	I can't. It's all very unclear in my mind.
5817080	5821080	If the boat's not here, we'll be stuck on the island forever and ever.
5821080	5827080	Oh, we pulled it well ashore, so it should be okay, but we'd better check on it as soon as we can.
5827080	5829080	I'll go have a look.
5829080	5832080	Quickly, moment. Be careful.
5833080	5837080	I remember I was just going to do it when I spotted this flower.
5837080	5840080	Just by a rocket was whole dear.
5842080	5844080	Woman.
5857080	5859080	Boy, that was close.
5859080	5864080	Tie it to the tree and make sure it's tight.
5864080	5866080	That should do it.
5866080	5868080	Just in time.
5868080	5871080	You know, the waves must have been huge to reach this far.
5871080	5873080	Well, we saved the boat.
5873080	5875080	Yes.
5875080	5879080	Well, this storm will be over soon.
5884080	5887080	Is everything okay?
5887080	5889080	Yep. Everything's fine.
5889080	5893080	Oh, thank goodness. So we're not stranded after all.
5893080	5895080	Huh? No.
5895080	5897080	We needn't have worried.
5897080	5901080	I'm very sorry. Really, I am.
5901080	5906080	Are you all right, Snort Maiden? Now I am.
5917080	5926080	According to this, the storm is blowing over now and it should stop raining soon.
5926080	5928080	Well, the wind seems to have dropped.
5928080	5932080	Oh, good. All that thunder and lightning is so noisy.
5932080	5938080	Ah, right. I think I'll just go for a bit of a walk before I settle down for the night.
5938080	5941080	But it's much too dark to see anything.
5941080	5945080	The fresh air will do me good.
5946080	5951080	Oh, ah! That's a good idea. I could do with some fresh air myself.
5951080	5954080	Wait for me. I'll come too.
5954080	5956080	Let me increase the water.
5956080	5959080	There's still there hundreds of them all glowing.
5959080	5961080	The hatty fat nurse.
5961080	5964080	They're waiting for us.
5965080	5975080	The lightning must have recharged them.
5975080	5981080	Look at them all. I wonder what they want, Snort Maiden.
5981080	5985080	Such a heavy storm would have given them lots and lots of energy.
5985080	5987080	Gosh, they're ready for anything.
5987080	5990080	They're not coming any closer.
5990080	5993080	They seem fairly friendly. Maybe they just want to see what we look like.
5993080	5995080	No, I know what they're here for.
5995080	5997080	Oh, what's that, Snuffkin?
5997080	5999080	It's their barometer, Moomin Papa.
5999080	6004080	They know we've got it and they've come to get it back from us.
6004080	6007080	Yes, I think you're right, Snuffkin.
6007080	6009080	Mr. Hamilton?
6009080	6012080	I do think you'd better give it back to them.
6012080	6014080	Do I have to?
6014080	6020080	Yes, of course. After all it is there isn't there are a lot of them.
6021080	6025080	Look, why don't you take it out to them now?
6029080	6033080	You know the barometer does belong to the Mr. Hamilton.
6033080	6037080	Oh, dear, dear. Give it to me.
6037080	6039080	Let me do it, Papa.
6039080	6043080	Well done, my boy.
6043080	6046080	You must be careful, my dear.
6046080	6048080	Don't worry, Mama.
6048080	6051080	My boy isn't he brave.
6073080	6077080	I think this is what you've come for.
6078080	6081080	Here you are. You can have it back now.
6082080	6084080	Moomin!
6091080	6094080	Moomin!
6094080	6097080	Moomin! Are you all right, Moomin?
6097080	6100080	I'll tell you something. I'm real glad there's no electricity where we live.
6100080	6103080	Oh, they didn't hurt you, did they?
6103080	6105080	Ah! Go away!
6105080	6108080	They were alone.
6108080	6111080	Are you all right, Snuffkin?
6111080	6115080	I'll tell you something. I'm real glad there's no electricity where we live.
6115080	6118080	Oh, they didn't hurt you, did they?
6118080	6121080	Ah! Go away!
6122080	6124080	Are you all right, Snuffkin?
6124080	6126080	What did he do to you?
6126080	6129080	Just a bit of shock, that's all.
6129080	6133080	What's that funny smell?
6133080	6136080	Oh, my god, it's your hair.
6136080	6139080	What do you mean?
6139080	6141080	What's happened to it?
6141080	6144080	Oh, no, my hair, Mama, Mama!
6144080	6147080	Where's your mirror? Oh, Mama!
6147080	6152080	Oh, look at what those wicked, hatty fat owners have done.
6152080	6155080	It's here in my handbag somewhere.
6155080	6159080	Hurry, Mama! I must see what's happened to my hair!
6159080	6162080	Here you are, dear.
6162080	6167080	Look at me! Look at me! It's awful!
6167080	6169080	It's horrible! It's horrible!
6169080	6173080	Don't worry, we'll put some magic ointment on and it'll come back all lovely and curly.
6173080	6176080	I don't want nasty curly hair.
6176080	6180080	I want my long, beautiful hair like it was before.
6184080	6188080	You know, it really doesn't matter to me, Snuffkin.
6193080	6198080	God, oh, good. I hope that's the last we see of them.
6198080	6202080	Oh, dear, what's happened to Snuffkin?
6203080	6210080	My hair, my hair, where's my hair?
6233080	6238080	Oh, dear, what's happened to Snuffkin?
6238080	6243080	Oh, dear, what's happened to Snuffkin?
6243080	6247080	Oh, dear, what's happened to Snuffkin?
6247080	6252080	Oh, dear, what's happened to Snuffkin?
6252080	6256080	Oh, dear, what's happened to Snuffkin?
6256080	6261080	Oh, dear, what's happened to Snuffkin?
6261080	6268080	Snuffkin!
6268080	6273080	Snuffkin!
6292080	6298080	Wake up, woman. We've got to hurry.
6313080	6316080	I wonder where they're going.
6316080	6319080	Perhaps they're saving a way to a secret island.
6319080	6326080	Somewhere very far away from here where they can live happily on their own together.
6326080	6330080	Gosh, Snuffkin, they're really weird.
6330080	6333080	Well, it depends on how you look at it, woman.
6333080	6340080	They probably think we're a bit strange, too.
6341080	6347080	Snuffkin, you're really horrible. You knew I wanted to see them.
6347080	6351080	Come on, you were fast asleep, snoring your head off.
6351080	6355080	That wasn't me snoring that was Mr. Him you went.
6355080	6358080	All right, if you say so.
6358080	6361080	Well, I hope that's the last I'll see of them.
6361080	6365080	Me, too. That's a very pretty scarf, Snort Maidum.
6365080	6368080	Yes, it is, isn't it?
6368080	6372080	Can we go exploring, Mama?
6372080	6374080	I don't see why not.
6374080	6380080	It looks as though it'll be a nice day and there'll be lots of exciting things washed up by the storm.
6380080	6384080	Oh, that'll be fun. Let's look for the other side of the island.
6384080	6388080	What a good idea. I might discover some more plants.
6399080	6406080	Mr. Himmelin, hurry up, sir. Or it will be dark before we get there.
6406080	6411080	You go on, Momen. I just want to have a better look at these flowers.
6411080	6415080	Yes, all right.
6415080	6419080	Very interesting.
6419080	6424080	Just think we could find all sorts of things lying on the sand.
6424080	6427080	I hope it's secrets, sunken treasure.
6427080	6429080	Well, let's hope it's not sunken anymore.
6429080	6433080	I expect there'll be lots and lots of treasures from shipwrecks and things like that.
6433080	6436080	But I find it before you.
6436080	6440080	Oh, no, you won't.
6444080	6448080	Look at all this. It's all mine.
6448080	6452080	I'm going to die, really.
6452080	6455080	What's that over there?
6455080	6458080	It's quite shallow right here.
6458080	6461080	Well, there must be something admit it.
6461080	6463080	Oh, dear. It's empty.
6463080	6467080	I think I found something here.
6470080	6472080	Little lie, little lie.
6472080	6475080	What's the matter?
6475080	6478080	Come and see these beautiful shells I have.
6478080	6482080	I'm too busy hunting for treasure to bother with shells.
6486080	6491080	Hey, what's this?
6491080	6494080	What?
6494080	6499080	Oh, look at this one.
6499080	6502080	I've got a real collection here.
6502080	6506080	Got a lovely mama's garden.
6506080	6513080	Wow, watch that.
6514080	6516080	What?
6516080	6519080	I can't find any as nice as yours.
6519080	6522080	Don't be in such an awful hurry, little lie.
6522080	6525080	Snark maiden, snark maiden.
6525080	6527080	Look, look what I found.
6527080	6529080	A proper treasure.
6529080	6532080	Look.
6532080	6537080	Oh, there's snow inside of it.
6537080	6539080	I found it in a cave.
6539080	6542080	What is it?
6543080	6544080	What's this?
6544080	6546080	It's a ship telescope.
6546080	6548080	You can see for miles with it.
6548080	6550080	I'll give it to Papa.
6550080	6555080	It's better than anything I got.
6555080	6556080	Hey, everybody.
6556080	6558080	I found something.
6558080	6561080	Come on up and have a look.
6561080	6565080	I wish I could find something interesting.
6568080	6571080	Have you found some buried treasure?
6573080	6577080	What a big lady.
6577080	6579080	Is she dead?
6579080	6581080	It's made of wood, Snark maiden.
6581080	6585080	It's a figurehead from a ship.
6594080	6597080	She's like a queen.
6597080	6601080	Ha, she hasn't got any legs though.
6602080	6605080	Why don't we put her on the front of our boat?
6605080	6607080	Nah, it's much too heavy.
6607080	6610080	It must have come from a ship that was wrecked.
6610080	6613080	And Sank had seen?
6613080	6616080	Perhaps it did.
6616080	6618080	And all hands were lost.
6618080	6620080	I want to take it home.
6620080	6622080	What would you do with it?
6622080	6626080	Use her to frighten people away.
6628080	6631080	Help! Somebody help me!
6631080	6634080	That's old Mr. Himmelin.
6634080	6637080	Gosh, I hope it's not more haddy fattiners.
6637080	6639080	Someone help, please.
6639080	6641080	We're coming.
6649080	6653080	Woman, why do you like this old figurehead so much?
6653080	6655080	You're staring at her.
6655080	6657080	She's not all that special, you know?
6657080	6659080	Yes, I know.
6659080	6661080	She's not even real.
6661080	6664080	Only made of wood.
6664080	6667080	Do you like her eyes?
6667080	6669080	Or is it her hair?
6669080	6672080	Just because I haven't got any?
6672080	6674080	Nearly there, just a bit further.
6674080	6677080	Come on, snuff it for me.
6677080	6680080	For her to want.
6680080	6684080	You're very heavy, Mr. Himmelin.
6684080	6686080	Thank you, snuff kid.
6686080	6688080	You saved my life.
6688080	6690080	Oh!
6690080	6693080	Boy, how'd you end up there, Mr. Himmelin?
6693080	6698080	One minute, I was looking for plants the next I'd fallen right into that hole.
6698080	6701080	I think you'd be safe for collecting stamps, Mr. Himmelin.
6701080	6705080	Oh no, it's not here. Where is it?
6705080	6708080	What is it now?
6708080	6710080	Tell me.
6710080	6712080	Make a move and preserve me.
6712080	6716080	Calm down, Mr. Himmelin. Tell me what's the matter?
6716080	6720080	My sample box, my sample box, oh my goodness.
6720080	6723080	You didn't leave it in the hole, did you?
6723080	6726080	Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you, oh dear.
6726080	6729080	All my precious samples, I'm so silly.
6729080	6731080	Oh, snuff kid.
6731080	6736080	Oh, snuff kid, would you mind?
6736080	6739080	Okay, anything for some peace.
6739080	6741080	Oh dear boy, you are wonderful.
6741080	6744080	You shall have one of my rarest plants as a reward.
6744080	6748080	And he, you shall, I shall choose a magnificent one for you.
6748080	6750080	Thank you very much, Mr. Himmelin.
6750080	6753080	Gosh, you're one of her movements.
6755080	6758080	Oh, there you are. What have you been up to?
6758080	6763080	He can't take his eyes off that silly wooden lady. He just dares at her.
6763080	6764080	Really?
6764080	6768080	I do not. I just think she has a very beautiful face.
6768080	6773080	Well, woman, now that you're here, I could really do with your help.
6773080	6775080	What do you want, snuff kid?
6775080	6779080	Mr. Himmelin dropped his box of samples down this hole and I'm going to try and get it.
6779080	6784080	I didn't drop it, I fell in the hole and just forgot it when stuff can pull me out.
6784080	6786080	You're a bit absent-minded, Mr. Himmelin.
6786080	6791080	No, I'm not, I can remember every Latin name of every single plant, you know.
6791080	6795080	Okay, I'll go down, woman, but you'll have to help me get back up.
6795080	6796080	Okay.
6796080	6799080	I'll help you too, now be careful.
6799080	6801080	Can you see it yet, snuff kid?
6801080	6803080	I'm not down at the bottom yet.
6803080	6805080	Oh, forgive me, I'm sorry.
6805080	6807080	I found it.
6807080	6810080	Wonderful, tell me, are the plants all right?
6810080	6813080	You can check them yourself in a minute.
6819080	6822080	Are you all right, snuff kid?
6822080	6825080	Wait a minute, I found something else.
6826080	6828080	Oh, look!
6828080	6829080	There's the boat.
6829080	6832080	It's Mom and Mom and Mom and Papa.
6832080	6834080	Hello.
6839080	6840080	It's gold.
6840080	6843080	Hello, we've been hunting treasure.
6846080	6849080	Go and get Mom and Papa, I found gold.
6849080	6852080	Boy, oh boy, I wonder how much there is.
6852080	6854080	Mum and Papa will know.
6864080	6868080	Well, Mum and Papa, what should we do with all this beautiful gold?
6868080	6871080	It would look lovely in the garden, don't you think?
6871080	6876080	With all the shells that the snorkemaiden found, they'll look good in amongst the roses.
6876080	6878080	What do you think, Mama?
6878080	6880080	I'm sure they will, Papa.
6880080	6881080	I'm sure they will.
6883080	6887080	Mum, she's only a stupid, legless doll.
6887080	6891080	You can have my bowl full of snorkemaiden.
6891080	6893080	No thanks.
6893080	6895080	Well, I'll look after it for you.
6895080	6898080	I can pretend it's my treasure.
6898080	6899080	Oh.
6904080	6908080	And that was the end of their first adventure in the new boat.
6908080	6914080	Mum and Papa decided that it was much more fun to set off without maps and sea charts.
6914080	6917080	You never know where you might end up.
6922080	6929080	They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.
6929080	6936080	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
6936080	6940080	They're always happy and always at play.
6940080	6943080	The movements are having fun day after day.
6943080	6947080	The movements.
6947080	6951080	The movements.
6951080	6958080	They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.
6958080	6965080	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
6965080	6969080	They're always happy and always at play.
6969080	6973080	The movements are having fun day after day.
6973080	6976080	The movements.
6976080	6980080	The movements.
6980080	6986080	The movements.
6995080	7006080	The movements.
7006080	7009080	Here they are for one and all.
7009080	7012080	The movements are about to come.
7012080	7015080	Come on and sit down here with me.
7015080	7020080	There for you on your TV they are the movements.
7020080	7023080	They are the movements.
7023080	7026080	Don't come with me give me your hand.
7026080	7029080	I'll take you up to a moment land.
7029080	7032080	You can fly just like a bird.
7032080	7034080	Sing that song ever.
7034080	7037080	There were the movements.
7037080	7040080	There were the movements.
7040080	7043080	There were the movements.
7043080	7046080	There were the movements.
7046080	7049080	There were the movements.

7121080	7123080	Hello, is love for me?
7128080	7131080	A letter for the ladies!
7132080	7134080	He's gonna fall in this time.
7134080	7135080	What?
7135080	7136080	Come on.
7136080	7137080	This way, towards me.
7137080	7138080	Come on.
7138080	7139080	Come on!
7140080	7141080	Oh!
7141080	7142080	Oh!
7142080	7143080	I got him!
7143080	7144080	Did you dig that hole?
7144080	7145080	Yeah!
7145080	7146080	No, weren't, didn't it?
7148080	7149080	All right.
7149080	7151080	Who's responsible for this?
7151080	7153080	Are you all right?
7153080	7156080	Did you dig this hole, young woman?
7156080	7157080	Of course not.
7157080	7158080	Who was it then?
7165080	7168080	Hi, you, I should have known.
7168080	7170080	Come here, you just wait.
7170080	7172080	Uh, hold on, Mr. Postman.
7172080	7173080	Can I help my letter, please?
7173080	7175080	Just do wait.
7193080	7194080	Here's the letter, mama.
7194080	7195080	Hmm?
7195080	7197080	A goodness, a letter.
7197080	7199080	I think it's from mumble.
7199080	7200080	Oh, really?
7202080	7204080	Where's little my, moment?
7204080	7205080	Well, she's um...
7205080	7208080	So, who's this letter from?
7208080	7211080	It's from my sister mumble, isn't it?
7211080	7212080	Oh, should I know?
7212080	7214080	She went on holiday to get away from me.
7214080	7218080	I bet she's coming back because she's missed all the fun.
7218080	7220080	She'd stay away if she had it in a sense.
7220080	7223080	This is the third time I've fallen into a hole.
7223080	7225080	Yes, I know.
7225080	7229080	But this is only the first time I've seen you do it.
7229080	7232080	What a horrible little child you are.
7232080	7233080	Artite!
7233080	7234080	Whoop!
7234080	7235080	Whoop, that was close!
7235080	7237080	Go on, fall off!
7237080	7238080	Whoop!
7238080	7240080	Whoop!
7240080	7241080	Whoop!
7241080	7242080	Whoop!
7242080	7243080	Whoop!
7243080	7244080	Whoop!
7244080	7245080	Whoop!
7245080	7247080	Mumble says that she's coming back.
7247080	7250080	She feels that she's ready to cope with little my again.
7250080	7252080	Oh, that's good news, moment, mama.
7253080	7256080	I think that we should go and give her house a good clean.
7256080	7259080	Have you told little my now mumble's coming?
7259080	7260080	She'll be able to go home.
7260080	7264080	No, I expect the postman is still chasing her around the garden.
7265080	7268080	Don't tell me why I don't want to know.
7270080	7271080	Mama!
7271080	7272080	Mama!
7272080	7274080	Is the letter from mumble?
7274080	7275080	What does she have to say?
7275080	7277080	Is she coming home?
7278080	7283080	And a few days later, mumble returned to Mum and Valley.
7286080	7290080	Now, mumble is a lot bigger and prettier than little my.
7290080	7293080	And what's more, she's a lot quieter.
7295080	7297080	That's Mum and Valley!
7297080	7298080	Over there!
7299080	7301080	It's not full of creepy crawlies, is it?
7301080	7303080	Not as far as I knowed.
7304080	7306080	Is there a house over there?
7306080	7308080	Maybe they have food, let's go.
7308080	7310080	Oh, that's Mum and House.
7316080	7318080	Are you going to Mum and Valley, too?
7320080	7322080	Yes, we thought we would.
7322080	7324080	That's nice, so am I.
7324080	7325080	We can go together.
7327080	7329080	Your suitcase looks very heavy.
7329080	7331080	Would you like a hand with me?
7332080	7333080	Oh, no!
7334080	7335080	Okay.
7336080	7339080	Are they nice to people that live in that house?
7339080	7341080	Yes, they are.
7341080	7342080	Could we stay there?
7342080	7344080	I'm sure you can.
7344080	7346080	My little sister is staying with them.
7346080	7348080	Follow me, I know the way, shall we go?
7354080	7355080	What's the matter?
7355080	7356080	Nothing.
7356080	7357080	We'll follow you.
7357080	7358080	All right.
7362080	7363080	Mum!
7367080	7368080	Mum!
7373080	7374080	Hello.
7374080	7375080	How are you?
7375080	7376080	Fine, you.
7376080	7377080	Fine.
7377080	7379080	Do you have a nice rest without me?
7379080	7381080	Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.
7383080	7386080	Oh, by the way, I'm at two very small strangers
7386080	7388080	who said they were coming here.
7388080	7390080	Coming here, mumble?
7390080	7393080	Yes, they're both the same size as little mine.
7393080	7398080	Both a bit odd and they're carrying a very large suitcase.
7398080	7402080	Right, I'd better make them up a small double bed then.
7402080	7404080	Thanks for the tea.
7404080	7407080	Now, are you ready to come home with me now, little mine?
7407080	7408080	No, not yet.
7408080	7411080	We've got to go home and tidy the house.
7411080	7413080	It hasn't been aired for the whole winter.
7413080	7415080	It's all right, mumble.
7415080	7417080	I cleaned and swept the floors the other day
7417080	7419080	and opened all the doors and windows.
7420080	7422080	Thank you very much.
7422080	7424080	It must have been a relief to be asleep most of the time
7424080	7426080	with the mice been staying with you.
7426080	7429080	They said they haven't been bored once since we woke up
7429080	7432080	and we've had a really good time together.
7432080	7434080	Isn't that right, Mum?
7437080	7439080	Bye now.
7441080	7442080	Well, well.
7442080	7445080	What does well, well, me, Papa?
7445080	7449080	Just that I might be able to hear myself think again now.
7449080	7451080	I know what you mean.
7457080	7459080	You're not thingin' me.
7459080	7461080	No, it's your turn to be great.
7461080	7463080	What if they scream when they see us?
7463080	7466080	But the lady told us they were friendly thingin' me.
7466080	7468080	Oh, sorry.
7478080	7480080	Go on, do it.
7480080	7482080	Excuse me.
7482080	7484080	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
7490080	7494080	Now, what's the matter with you, too?
7494080	7497080	Don't forget your suitcase, will you?
7500080	7503080	It's alright, don't be frightened.
7503080	7505080	I won't eat you.
7505080	7507080	I'm the police inspector here.
7507080	7509080	Been in the valley for years.
7509080	7510080	Police?
7510080	7511080	Oh, no.
7511080	7512080	Oh, no.
7512080	7513080	We're not thieves.
7513080	7515080	Well, I'm all in the suitcase.
7515080	7516080	Oh, no.
7516080	7518080	We're under a bed.
7518080	7521080	Well, nobody said that you did.
7521080	7523080	Then you haven't come to arrest us.
7523080	7525080	Have you?
7525080	7526080	Of course I haven't.
7526080	7528080	I've come to see the movement family.
7532080	7534080	It is our suitcase.
7534080	7536080	It is.
7536080	7537080	Of course it is.
7537080	7540080	Now, have you come to see the movements, too?
7541080	7542080	Hello?
7542080	7544080	Oh, oh, oh.
7544080	7546080	Oh, there you are.
7546080	7548080	I thought it was you.
7549080	7553080	Are you expecting these two guests, Mum and Mama?
7553080	7554080	I think so.
7554080	7557080	And they've got a suitcase, so they must be staying.
7557080	7558080	That's nice.
7558080	7560080	You will stay, won't you?
7560080	7562080	Is it alright with you?
7562080	7564080	Of course it is.
7564080	7566080	I'm Mum and Mama.
7566080	7569080	I'm Dany, and this is my friend Bob, Mum and Mama.
7569080	7571080	You're welcome.
7571080	7574080	Come in and make yourselves at home.
7574080	7577080	I think it'll be okay, Dany.
7579080	7580080	Careful!
7580080	7581080	He must have dropped it!
7581080	7582080	Hi!
7584080	7586080	They are a bit strange, aren't they?
7586080	7588080	Yes, definitely.
7588080	7590080	So, what can I do for you today, Inspector?
7590080	7595080	Oh, well, I heard that Mumble was back from holiday, so...
7595080	7597080	Yes, that's right.
7597080	7599080	Oh, do you want...
7599080	7601080	Are you here now?
7601080	7602080	No, Inspector.
7602080	7604080	I'm afraid she's gone home with little Mai.
7604080	7606080	Oh, right.
7606080	7608080	I have to keep an eye on things, you know?
7608080	7610080	Very important.
7610080	7611080	Who goes away?
7611080	7613080	Who comes back?
7615080	7619080	Well, I'll say goodbye, Dan, Mum and Mama.
7620080	7623080	I do believe he's fallen for Mumble.
7623080	7625080	But has she fallen for him?
7625080	7626080	I wonder.
7626080	7627080	What are the new guests doing?
7627080	7629080	Looking scared, mostly.
7629080	7631080	Who one...
7631080	7632080	Do one...
7632080	7634080	Do one...
7637080	7639080	Do one...
7651080	7652080	Here you are.
7652080	7653080	I've emptied these drawers for you.
7653080	7655080	There should be enough room.
7655080	7657080	Thank you, Norman.
7663080	7665080	Where should we put this suitcase?
7666080	7668080	Let's see.
7668080	7670080	In this drawer?
7674080	7676080	Look, there's a good place to hide, too.
7676080	7677080	Oh, look at this.
7677080	7680080	They made such a pretty bad for us.
7680080	7682080	I like the movements.
7682080	7684080	They didn't scream at all.
7687080	7690080	You still gotta be careful, though.
7697080	7698080	No.
7700080	7703080	We've had some very strange people staying at our house,
7703080	7706080	but I think these two are really weird.
7706080	7708080	Well, they're Northerners.
7708080	7709080	I guess so.
7709080	7711080	With names like Thingamy and Bob.
7711080	7713080	And that suitcase.
7713080	7717080	They look a lot like fugitives to me, Snuffkin.
7717080	7720080	And perhaps they're dangerous criminals on the run.
7720080	7722080	Do you want to see them?
7722080	7725080	Yeah, I wouldn't mind, Mum.
7725080	7726080	Norman?
7752080	7754080	Ah, there you are.
7754080	7755080	Where are they doing now?
7755080	7756080	No idea.
7756080	7760080	I couldn't hear anything, so they must be asleep.
7760080	7763080	We think they're fugitives, Mum and Papa.
7763080	7765080	They're probably on the run from the law.
7765080	7769080	Well, they are a bit funny, but they're suitcase.
7769080	7771080	Gold coins.
7771080	7773080	Stole and state secrets.
7773080	7776080	We better hide all the matches, Papa.
7776080	7779080	Public enemies, numbers, and two,
7779080	7781080	but they don't look like it, though.
7782080	7784080	How about some tea, Snuffkin?
7784080	7785080	Sniff?
7785080	7786080	Yes, please.
7786080	7788080	Any cakes as well?
7789080	7790080	Oh.
7810080	7811080	Thingamy?
7819080	7821080	Oh, no.
7821080	7823080	This look is gone, too.
7823080	7824080	What am I going to do?
7824080	7825080	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
7825080	7826080	What am I going to do?
7826080	7828080	What am I going to do?
7828080	7830080	You wake up, ready?
7830080	7831080	Oh.
7831080	7833080	What a nerfie you're doing under the bed.
7833080	7836080	It's the safest place.
7836080	7838080	Something's about to happen, though.
7838080	7840080	I can feel her coming.
7840080	7841080	That's what woke me up.
7841080	7842080	Don't be silly.
7842080	7844080	She can't know we're here.
7844080	7845080	She can.
7845080	7848080	And I know she'll be here to hide.
7855080	7858080	Well, it's very windy tonight, moment.
7858080	7862080	You know, chilly, too, don't you think?
7862080	7865080	Oh, hello.
7867080	7869080	Did you sleep well?
7869080	7871080	Would you like some tea?
7871080	7873080	Hey, so that's them.
7874080	7875080	Don't worry.
7875080	7876080	These are good friends of mine.
7876080	7877080	Let me introduce you.
7877080	7879080	Sniff and snuff can.
7882080	7884080	And what's the matter?
7887080	7888080	She's coming.
7888080	7890080	Yes, she is.
7890080	7892080	Well, who is my dear?
7892080	7893080	The girl.
7893080	7894080	The girl.
7894080	7896080	Yes ... she's terrible.
7896080	7897080	Who?
7899080	7900080	You know who she is?
7900080	7901080	Yes.
7901080	7902080	I've never seen her.
7902080	7904080	But I've heard she's a scary monster, all right.
7904080	7905080	Scary monster?
7905080	7908080	And this, uh, grope is after you.
7908080	7910080	Yes, she is.
7922080	7924080	Now, don't you worry.
7924080	7926080	She'll think twice before she tangles with me.
7926080	7927080	Will she?
7927080	7930080	If she's a scary monster?
7930080	7931080	Monster or not.
7931080	7934080	If you're a guest in Moomin House, nothing will harm you.
7934080	7935080	Right, everyone.
7935080	7938080	Lock all the doors and you two go to your room.
7938080	7940080	Thank you, Moomin Papa.
7940080	7943080	Nobody is going to get in here.
7943080	7944080	Well said.
7944080	7948080	To Am's family, to Am's.
7948080	7951080	Ready for more tea, anyone?
7953080	7954080	What's the matter?
7954080	7957080	We're going to be attacked by a huge scary monster.
7957080	7958080	Heavens.
7959080	7962080	You'd better get the frying pan, Mama.
7962080	7963080	Oh dear.
7968080	7969080	All right.
7969080	7971080	Has everyone got a weapon?
7989080	7990080	Oh.
8012080	8015080	Well, it's midnight.
8015080	8016080	I don't know.
8016080	8017080	It's midnight.
8017080	8020080	I don't believe in that stupid grog.
8020080	8021080	I hope you're right.
8030080	8031080	She's coming.
8031080	8032080	She's here.
8032080	8034080	Yes, she's very close now.
8047080	8049080	I'm going home.
8050080	8051080	This is silly.
8051080	8052080	We can't wait up all night.
8052080	8055080	Besides, I'm getting very sleepy.
8055080	8057080	It's up to you.
8057080	8058080	Right.
8058080	8059080	I'm going, man.
8059080	8060080	Moomin Papa.
8060080	8061080	Watch your back.
8063080	8064080	Yes.
8064080	8065080	Keep in the open.
8065080	8068080	You guys are only trying to frighten me.
8068080	8071080	Well, it won't work.
8076080	8077080	She's here.
8077080	8079080	No, she's not.
8079080	8081080	There are no such things as monsters.
8081080	8084080	Just a trap blowing the candles out.
8093080	8094080	Hmm.
8094080	8095080	You see?
8095080	8097080	There's nobody there.
8097080	8102080	Well, in that case, there's nothing to stop you going home, Sniff.
8106080	8108080	Do you think I'm scared?
8108080	8109080	You're making it up.
8109080	8110080	Come on, admit it.
8110080	8112080	There aren't any grog.
8112080	8113080	Not at all.
8129080	8130080	You see?
8130080	8132080	There's no one here at all.
8137080	8138080	Uh-huh.
8150080	8152080	Oh, be careful.
8152080	8153080	Watch what you're doing.
8153080	8154080	It's here.
8154080	8155080	It's here.
8155080	8156080	Where?
8156080	8158080	Right outside that door.
8158080	8160080	Big and black and horrible.
8160080	8161080	Right.
8162080	8164080	No, don't open it.
8164080	8165080	She'll get in.
8167080	8169080	Come on, everybody.
8175080	8177080	Well, there's nobody here, Sniff.
8177080	8178080	Are you sure?
8184080	8186080	I can't see anything.
8187080	8189080	Oh, I must have scared.
8189080	8192080	That silly old grog away, moment.
8192080	8195080	That will teach her to come sniffing around here, all right?
8195080	8197080	No, that she is.
8210080	8211080	Mm-hmm.
8211080	8213080	Mrs. Groke, we'd like you to go home.
8213080	8215080	Now you just go on.
8216080	8218080	You're upsetting our guests.
8218080	8220080	And you're freezing my roses.
8220080	8222080	Yes, you've been bullied.
8224080	8227080	I'm sorry, but you really must leave.
8227080	8229080	Please go before I count to ten.
8229080	8242080	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine and a half.
8246080	8248080	All right.
8268080	8270080	All right.
8270080	8272080	All right.
8272080	8274080	What?
8276080	8278080	Hey, are you all right, moment?
8278080	8280080	Look at the ground.
8282080	8284080	It's all frozen.
8294080	8296080	That's a Groke's voice.
8297080	8299080	It's cold.
8299080	8300080	Isn't it?
8300080	8302080	I don't think she'll be back tonight.
8302080	8304080	Let's all go in and have a hot drink.
8306080	8309080	The Groke didn't come back that night.
8309080	8312080	But what did she want in movement house?
8312080	8319080	And will she return perhaps another night when they're all asleep?
8319080	8326080	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
8326080	8334080	Believing is sharing and caring and giving the movements.
8334080	8338080	They're always happy and always at play.
8338080	8341080	The movements are having fun day after day.
8341080	8345080	The movements.
8345080	8349080	The movements.
8349080	8356080	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
8356080	8363080	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
8364080	8367080	They're always happy and always at play.
8367080	8371080	The movements are having fun day after day.
8371080	8374080	The movements.
8374080	8378080	The movements.
8378080	8384080	The movements.
8393080	8404080	The movements.
8404080	8407080	Here they are for one and all.
8407080	8410080	The movements are about to come.
8410080	8413080	Come on and sit down here with me.
8413080	8415080	They're for you on your TV.
8415080	8418080	They are the movements.
8418080	8421080	They are the movements.
8421080	8424080	So come with me, give me your hand.
8424080	8427080	I'll take you up to a movement land.
8427080	8430080	You can fly just like a bird.
8430080	8432080	Sing that song ever.
8432080	8435080	There were the movements.
8435080	8438080	There were the movements.
8438080	8441080	There were the movements.
8441080	8444080	There were the movements.
8444080	8447080	There were the movements.
8447080	8450080	There were the movements.
8450080	8453080	There were the movements.
8453080	8456080	There were the movements.
8456080	8459080	There were the movements.
8459080	8462080	There were the movements.
8462080	8465080	There were the movements.
8465080	8468080	There were the movements.
8468080	8471080	There were the movements.
8471080	8474080	There were the movements.
8474080	8477080	There were the movements.
8477080	8480080	There were the movements.
8480080	8483080	There were the movements.
8503080	8505080	With all the excitement of that night,
8505080	8510080	Sniff decided not to go home and was sharing movement's bed.
8510080	8514080	Snuffkin, as always, preferred to sleep in his tent.
8514080	8516080	You remember what happened?
8516080	8522080	The horrible grok coming after thingamy and bob and everything freezing?
8522080	8527080	For a moment, however, the night wasn't quite over yet.
8535080	8538080	Mommy, papa! Help me!
8538080	8541080	The grok is after me!
8548080	8551080	I can't run anymore!
8566080	8571080	Why am I on the floor?
8571080	8574080	Sniff?
8583080	8585080	Morning, mama.
8585080	8588080	Good morning, moving. Is Sniff up yet?
8588080	8590080	You're joking.
8590080	8592080	Where is the thingamy and bob?
8592080	8594080	It's not stirred yet.
8594080	8596080	The poor things are tired out.
8596080	8598080	Papa's not still asleep, is he?
8598080	8602080	No, he's looking at my rose bushes.
8602080	8605080	Are they okay, papa?
8605080	8607080	No, frozen to death and look.
8607080	8609080	What?
8609080	8613080	That's where she was standing over there where the grass is dead.
8616080	8619080	She must have been real cold to freeze the roses.
8619080	8621080	What a shame! They were very pretty.
8621080	8626080	There's not much left to them now. We'll have to grow some new ones.
8626080	8628080	I dreamed that she was chasing me, papa.
8628080	8633080	Oh, don't worry, moment. I think she's only after thingamy and bob.
8633080	8636080	So there are not fugitives from justice, after all?
8636080	8641080	I have a feeling that they would prefer that moment.
8642080	8644080	Aren't thingamy and bob coming down?
8644080	8647080	Yes, if they could have breakfast in their room, if you didn't mind.
8647080	8649080	Well, what did they tell you?
8649080	8650080	What?
8650080	8652080	About why the groke is chasing them.
8652080	8657080	Oh, they just looked terrified and wouldn't say anything about her at all.
8657080	8661080	You know, we really ought to find out why.
8661080	8663080	Yes, you're right.
8663080	8668080	Moment, mama, why don't you take their breakfast up and see if they'll find out why?
8668080	8672080	Moment, mama, why don't you take their breakfast up and see if they'll tell you anything?
8672080	8675080	If any of us can get it out of the meal can.
8688080	8689080	Who's that?
8689080	8693080	It's only me. I've brought you both a nice breakfast.
8698080	8705080	Well, what did they say?
8705080	8709080	It seems that the groke is after the suitcase, not them.
8709080	8713080	I wonder what's in it, perhaps they've stolen her mummy as well.
8713080	8717080	And they also said that it did use to belong to her.
8717080	8721080	Oh dear, if they've stolen it, they're not.
8722080	8726080	And they also said that it did use to belong to her.
8726080	8728080	Oh dear, if they've stolen it.
8728080	8731080	I don't know about that.
8731080	8735080	I asked them how they got it, but they wouldn't say another word.
8735080	8736080	Well, this is too much.
8736080	8738080	We could be harboring criminals.
8738080	8742080	I know they don't look like it, but you never know, do you?
8742080	8744080	You can ask the groke.
8744080	8745080	Don't shout.
8745080	8747080	No, that's no good.
8747080	8750080	We don't want to come back here most definitely.
8750080	8753080	Let's ask the police inspector to question them.
8753080	8756080	We don't want to get the police involved.
8756080	8758080	Well, you'll suggest something, Anne.
8758080	8762080	Quit shouting, sniff.
8762080	8767080	Look, why don't you just wait for them to tell you a moment?
8767080	8771080	I know it seems strange, but I've noticed that if you pretend not to be interested,
8771080	8774080	people can't wait to tell you those secrets.
8774080	8778080	They told Mama about the suitcase, but they wouldn't say anything to Papa.
8778080	8782080	You know something, Moomin. They might open up to Snork Maiden.
8782080	8784080	She's someone more their own age.
8784080	8787080	You could be right.
8790080	8792080	Hey, Snork Maiden.
8792080	8793080	Where are you going?
8793080	8795080	Moomin house.
8795080	8796080	I'll come with you.
8796080	8799080	But I thought you were living there.
8799080	8801080	I was until mumble came back yesterday.
8801080	8803080	How is she?
8803080	8806080	Bossy, and she snores, too.
8806080	8807080	Moomin.
8807080	8808080	Snork Maiden.
8808080	8810080	Where are you off to?
8810080	8813080	Well, I was just on my way to see you.
8813080	8817080	Oh, that's so nice, and I've come to see you, Moomin.
8817080	8820080	I brought you a little present, Moomin.
8820080	8821080	A present for me.
8821080	8823080	Yes, and it's very beautiful.
8823080	8824080	What is it?
8824080	8826080	Something you must never break or lose.
8826080	8828080	I promise I won't.
8828080	8830080	There you are.
8830080	8831080	Thank you.
8831080	8833080	Go on, open it.
8837080	8839080	Oh, what a beautiful shell.
8839080	8843080	I spent all of yesterday on the beach searching for it just for you.
8843080	8846080	Look, we can see ourselves in it.
8846080	8847080	So we can.
8847080	8849080	Thank you very much, Snork Maiden.
8849080	8852080	It's my heart, and I want you to look after me.
8852080	8854080	Oh, I will, Snork Maiden.
8854080	8855080	I will.
8855080	8857080	I'll think of you whenever I look at it.
8857080	8858080	I'm Moomin.
8858080	8863080	I promise you that I'll always kiss the shell before I go to sleep.
8864080	8866080	It will be my most precious treasure.
8866080	8868080	Apart from me.
8870080	8871080	So what shall I do?
8871080	8873080	Take them for a walk?
8873080	8876080	Yes, but take your time and don't rush them.
8876080	8878080	I'll let them cry on my shoulder.
8878080	8881080	Yes, and try and talk to them as well, though.
8881080	8885080	I feel very important and a little bit nervous, too.
8885080	8886080	Have some tea first.
8886080	8888080	Thank you, Moomin, Mama.
8889080	8891080	Ah!
8899080	8901080	We don't need your help, little Mai.
8901080	8902080	Ha, that's what you think.
8902080	8904080	I'd be able to weedle out their secrets.
8904080	8906080	It's not an interrogation.
8906080	8908080	We only want to talk to them, you know.
8908080	8910080	So you can weedle out their secrets.
8910080	8911080	I'll be very quiet.
8911080	8915080	Little Mai, have you ever managed to be very quiet?
8916080	8919080	Not really, but there's only one way to find out.
8919080	8921080	You must let me go with Snork Maiden.
8921080	8925080	No, this situation needs a tender understanding, Moomin.
8926080	8928080	That's me, exactly!
8928080	8929080	You ready?
8929080	8931080	I suppose so.
8931080	8933080	Hello, it's Moomin.
8933080	8935080	Can I talk to you for a minute?
8937080	8938080	Hello?
8940080	8941080	This is Snork Maiden.
8941080	8943080	She's a very good friend of mine.
8943080	8946080	Hello, I'm very happy to meet you both.
8947080	8949080	She's very tender and understanding,
8949080	8950080	and she'd like to talk to you.
8950080	8951080	Can she come in?
8954080	8956080	Well, if she has to, Moomin.
8959080	8960080	Come in, Mai.
8963080	8966080	You pee, you pee, you pee.
8968080	8971080	It's very beautiful, a perfect heart shape.
8971080	8974080	I've never seen anything like it, Moomin.
8974080	8976080	Would you like one, Mama?
8976080	8977080	No, my dear.
8977080	8979080	There should only be one shell like this.
8979080	8982080	Then would you keep it somewhere safe for me?
8988080	8990080	Well, Snork Maiden.
8992080	8994080	I'm sure Snork Maiden will get it out of him.
8994080	8997080	I do hope so. I think they like it anyway.
8998080	9002080	I have a feeling in my bones that Groke will be back tonight.
9002080	9003080	Oh.
9003080	9006080	If we could find out why she's after them, we'd know what to do.
9007080	9011080	Mama won't have any garden left if that monster comes back every night.
9011080	9012080	Moomin.
9020080	9022080	Well done, Snork Maiden.
9027080	9028080	Little Mai.
9032080	9035080	Oh no, she'll ruin everything if we don't stop her.
9040080	9043080	If you interfere, little Mai, I'll never forgive you.
9043080	9045080	What, interfere? Me? Never.
9046080	9049080	Look, let's just leave it up to Snork Maiden now, little Mai.
9049080	9052080	You'll need me if Snork Maiden's not tender and understanding enough.
9053080	9054080	Hey, Moomin.
9055080	9058080	So, how is Snork Maiden getting on?
9058080	9061080	Taking them for a stroll? Where are they?
9069080	9071080	If we were narrow.
9071080	9073080	Papa, if we get much closer.
9073080	9076080	And the last thing we want is for them to see us.
9077080	9080080	Looks like I'll have to go and talk to them. You're all too big.
9080080	9082080	I'll come back later and tell you what they said.
9083080	9085080	No, don't. You'll upset Snork Maiden.
9085080	9087080	You're the one who's upsetting her.
9089080	9093080	All right. Can I ask you again about the suitcase?
9093080	9094080	Yes.
9094080	9097080	Does that suitcase belong to you or is it the groaks?
9098080	9099080	No.
9102080	9105080	Let's try it another way. Who's is that suitcase?
9105080	9107080	It's yours, it's yours.
9108080	9113080	But you told Moomin Mama that it wasn't yours. It was the groaks.
9113080	9115080	Yes, we did.
9117080	9121080	Do you mind if I ask you one more time?
9121080	9123080	Please do.
9123080	9125080	Right. Here we go.
9125080	9128080	Now, all I want is a simple yes or no.
9128080	9130080	Is that suitcase yours or not?
9130080	9132080	No, yes.
9133080	9137080	Oh, take your time, Snork Maiden.
9137080	9139080	And don't rush them, he said.
9139080	9141080	What was that, Snork Maiden?
9141080	9144080	Look, I'm sorry, but can I ask you again?
9144080	9146080	Yes, as many times as you want.
9146080	9149080	Thank you. This is the very last time.
9149080	9151080	So please tell me the truth.
9154080	9156080	Now then, the suitcase.
9156080	9157080	Yes.
9157080	9158080	You know which one?
9158080	9159080	Yes.
9159080	9161080	Does it belong to you?
9161080	9163080	Yes, it does.
9163080	9165080	So it's not the groaks.
9165080	9167080	Yes, it is not the groaks.
9167080	9170080	At last, we're getting somewhere, praise the booble.
9170080	9173080	We're very happy for you.
9173080	9175080	Snork Maiden is really having to work hard.
9175080	9178080	I wouldn't have, I'd scare them into talking.
9178080	9179080	You should have let me go.
9179080	9181080	Yeah, but we wanted someone gentle.
9181080	9184080	Snork Maiden is nice.
9184080	9187080	Everybody in this house is nice.
9187080	9190080	Do you think they'd let us stay here forever?
9190080	9191080	Of course.
9191080	9193080	If we can keep away from the grog.
9196080	9198080	It took a long time, but in the end they trusted me.
9198080	9200080	And now we're good friends.
9200080	9203080	Who wouldn't trust you and want to be good friends?
9203080	9204080	Thank you.
9204080	9208080	It wasn't easy, though. They kept speaking together and I got rather muddled.
9208080	9210080	But they did tell me somehow.
9210080	9211080	Rather muddled.
9211080	9214080	I told you guys, you should have let me do it.
9214080	9217080	Oh, I'm afraid I didn't get very much, though.
9217080	9219080	I knew you wouldn't.
9219080	9222080	So, what did you find out then, Snork Maiden?
9222080	9223080	Tell us.
9223080	9227080	Well, first of all, the suitcase does seem to be theirs.
9227080	9229080	That was one thing they made very clear.
9229080	9230080	Linhul can the grog.
9230080	9231080	Just a minute, Moomin.
9231080	9235080	What's in the suitcase on the other hand belongs to the grog.
9235080	9236080	That's the problem.
9236080	9240080	Oh, dear. So they do have something belonging to a...
9240080	9241080	Oh.
9241080	9243080	Well, Snork Maiden, what is it?
9243080	9245080	They wouldn't tell me what it is, little Mai.
9245080	9248080	Only that it is the most beautiful thing in the world.
9248080	9250080	Oh, is it?
9250080	9252080	I wonder.
9252080	9255080	This is very difficult to understand.
9255080	9259080	I mean, thing of me and Bob don't look like thieves at all, do they?
9259080	9262080	So, the grog just wanted back what is hers.
9262080	9266080	I don't see how that big ugly monster could own the most beautiful thing in the world.
9266080	9270080	Well, what they said was that she just happened to have it.
9270080	9273080	They didn't say whether it belonged to her or not.
9273080	9275080	So she might have stolen it herself.
9275080	9277080	They shouldn't have taken it, though.
9277080	9279080	Oh, dear, oh, dear.
9279080	9284080	Bob and thing of me are very frightened of how she'll take her revenge if she catches them.
9284080	9288080	But they're very determined to keep what's in the suitcase, Moomin, Papa.
9288080	9291080	Oh, this is a fine mess indeed.
9291080	9293080	The grog is sure to come back tonight.
9293080	9294080	What can we do?
9294080	9296080	What can we do?
9296080	9297080	What can we do?
9297080	9299080	We can do the same as before.
9299080	9301080	Yeah, but it's not fair to drive her away.
9301080	9304080	If what's in the suitcase really does belong to her?
9305080	9310080	She means to get the suitcase and I don't think it will be so easy to get rid of her this time.
9310080	9313080	And if she stays, we'll have a never-ending winter.
9314080	9317080	Well, I'll cover up the petunias just in case.
9317080	9319080	Are you all going to stay here?
9319080	9320080	I'll look after Snork.
9320080	9322080	I will, Moomin, Mama, I'll stay.
9322080	9324080	You'll stay, won't you, Snuffkin?
9324080	9326080	Don't look so clump, everyone.
9326080	9327080	I've got an idea.
9327080	9330080	But it would help if we knew what was in that suitcase.
9330080	9332080	But even if we didn't, it could still work.
9332080	9334080	And what is it, dear?
9334080	9337080	Just wait, Papa. You'll see.
9393080	9394080	Oh!
9407080	9409080	She's coming!
9409080	9410080	Are we?
9410080	9412080	She's not far away!
9412080	9414080	Oh, I hope Moomin Papa can do something.
9414080	9416080	It's your girl, little mom.
9416080	9417080	Yes, I know.
9417080	9419080	There's the king and the queen.
9420080	9421080	This one?
9422080	9424080	Uh-oh, she's coming.
9424080	9426080	Just when I was winning.
9426080	9429080	You better hide under the table, little my.
9429080	9430080	Don't be stupid!
9430080	9433080	How can I hit her with my rolling pin from there?
9442080	9443080	Where is she, Papa?
9443080	9445080	Exactly where she was yesterday.
9445080	9447080	I'll go for a toast, alright, Papa?
9447080	9452080	Let me go first, and then the rest of you can fan out behind me.
9452080	9454080	Moomin Mama.
9454080	9456080	What is it, Papa?
9456080	9459080	Perhaps now's the time to tell us your idea.
9459080	9461080	We haven't long.
9462080	9464080	Wait!
9473080	9477080	Don't go away! We want to talk to you!
9477080	9483080	We know that you've come back to get what thingamy and Bob took from you.
9483080	9487080	That is right, isn't it, huh?
9487080	9494080	Well, won't you let them keep it, uh, perhaps?
9494080	9499080	Now, will you sell it to them?
9499080	9501080	Oh, dear.
9501080	9505080	I have some very beautiful things here in my bag.
9505080	9509080	Maybe you'd like to trade, Groke?
9518080	9522080	What about this pendant? Isn't it lovely?
9525080	9527080	So, you don't like that?
9527080	9530080	Uh, what about this then?
9532080	9535080	Or this?
9539080	9541080	Oh.
9541080	9544080	All right. Why don't you choose?
9544080	9549080	Take anything you want from my handbag, except the hair slide.
9556080	9560080	Which one do you want, this one?
9560080	9564080	Let me see, with this.
9564080	9568080	Oh, this one?
9568080	9572080	Oh, dear, that's not really mine to give to you.
9572080	9574080	The snorkemaiden gave that to Mumen.
9574080	9578080	Is it all right if I give the shell to her Mumen?
9578080	9580080	Oh, Mum!
9580080	9581080	You'll never allow.
9581080	9582080	Are you all right?
9582080	9587080	Yes, my hand was suddenly frozen.
9587080	9590080	No, you've got the shell, Mrs. Groke.
9590080	9595080	Do you promise not to come back anymore?
9595080	9599080	Because I'll get you if you do.
9603080	9607080	Oh, Mum!
9613080	9617080	Well, that was a close thing. I'm glad that's over.
9617080	9620080	Oh, you were marvelous, Mumen.
9622080	9624080	I'm so sorry, Mumen.
9624080	9628080	I forgot that I had put your precious shell in my handbag to keep it safe.
9628080	9631080	It's all right, Mumen. You gave it in a good cause.
9633080	9636080	What snorkemaiden going to say, Mumen?
9636080	9637080	What?
9637080	9640080	I heard you. You said you'd never go to sleep without kissing it,
9640080	9643080	or something equally stupid.
9643080	9645080	Well, I'm not going to tell snorkemaiden,
9645080	9649080	but I think Mum, I did the right thing.
9649080	9652080	She'll find out I'm fed up with secrets.
9652080	9657080	I'm always going to tell the truth from now on, no matter what.
9663080	9667080	Mumen, Mumen! Look! I found one!
9667080	9669080	Really?
9669080	9674080	Well, it's very similar, but the one snorkemaiden gave me was much bigger.
9674080	9677080	Oh, a lot bigger, was it?
9677080	9680080	Mumen had decided that he had to find a shell that was exactly the same
9680080	9682080	as the one snorkemaiden had given him.
9682080	9687080	Then with luck, she would never find out what he'd done with it.
9693080	9695080	Oh!
9700080	9704080	This is it! This is it! I killed it!
9707080	9710080	It's exactly the same as the other one.
9710080	9713080	Nothing short of a miracle, isn't it?
9713080	9716080	But then in Mumen Valley, miracles do happen.
9717080	9725080	They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.
9725080	9732080	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
9732080	9736080	They're always happy and always at play.
9736080	9740080	The movements are having fun day after day.
9740080	9747080	They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.
9747080	9754080	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
9754080	9758080	They're always happy and always at play.
9758080	9762080	The movements are having fun day after day.
9762080	9765080	The movements are having fun day after day.
9765080	9770080	The movements are having fun day after day.
9770080	9773080	The movements.
9773080	9777080	The movements.
9777080	9783080	The movements.
9795080	9802080	The movements.
9802080	9805080	Here they are for one and all.
9805080	9808080	The movements are about to come.
9808080	9811080	Come on and sit down here with me.
9811080	9813080	They're here for you on your TV.
9813080	9816080	They are the movements.
9816080	9819080	They are the movements.
9819080	9822080	So come with me, give me your hand.
9822080	9825080	I'll take you up to Mumen land.
9825080	9828080	You can fly just like a bird.
9828080	9830080	Sing that song ever.
9830080	9833080	There were the movements.
9833080	9836080	There were the movements.
9836080	9839080	There were the movements.
9839080	9842080	There were the movements.
9842080	9845080	There were the movements.
9845080	9848080	There were the movements.
9852080	9855080	There were the movements.
9855080	9858080	There were the movements.
9858080	9861080	There were the movements.
9861080	9864080	There were the movements.
9864080	9867080	There were the movements.
9867080	9870080	There were the movements.
9870080	9873080	There were the movements.
9873080	9876080	There were the movements.
9876080	9879080	There were the movements.
9879080	9885080	There were the movements.
9885080	9890080	There were the movements.
9890080	9894080	There were the movements.
9894080	9897080	There were the movements.
9897080	9900080	I can't.
9900080	9917280	That's all right.
9917280	9921520	Thank you, think of me.
9921520	9922520	Are you going out?
9922520	9924520	Yes, for a walk.
9924520	9927520	We'll have fun.
9927520	9936440	It seems that think of me and Bob are well and truly part of Moomin House now.
9936440	9940920	Luckily, they don't eat a lot, and are small enough to find the pencils that fall between
9940920	9945360	the floorboards in the porch.
9945360	9950440	Hey, this looks like a great hiding place.
9950440	9952440	Nobody would ever find it here.
9952440	9953440	Come on, Bob.
9953440	9956440	Let's go get the suitcase, man.
9956440	9961240	Are you sure it's not safe for an alarm?
9961240	9964320	What would you say if someone went in when we went there?
9964320	9967880	You wouldn't like it, would you?
9967880	9971880	I think the Moomin's are much too nice to do anything like that.
9971880	9972880	It's not there.
9972880	9975320	It's the guests I'm thinking about.
9975320	9980280	You know the Moomin's let anybody stay.
9980280	9983160	Snork maiden.
9983160	9985160	You lied to me, little Mai.
9985160	9986680	Who me?
9986680	9991120	Moomin still has the shell that I gave him, but you said that he didn't.
9991120	9992120	Impossible.
9992120	9994240	Moomin mama gave it to the croak.
9994240	9996080	I was there when she did it.
9996080	9997400	Look, I saw it.
9997400	9998760	He showed it to me.
9998760	10000120	Are you really sure?
10000120	10001440	Was it the same one?
10001440	10002440	Of course it was.
10002440	10004640	I'm not stupid, you know.
10004640	10005800	That's very odd.
10005800	10008360	I saw her do it with my own eyes.
10008360	10011840	Well, I'll go and ask Moomin right now, little Mai.
10011840	10016080	It's a bit awkward, but if I'm going to be honest, Snork maiden.
10016080	10017080	What?
10017080	10020920	Well, I've decided that from now on, I'm only going to tell the truth.
10020920	10021920	Oh, yes.
10021920	10024520	And I found something you might be interested in.
10024520	10026080	Well, what is it?
10026080	10029720	Mungle and I were down on the beach yesterday, and you remember all those things we found
10029720	10031040	washed up by the storm?
10031040	10035120	Do you mean on the haddy fatter's island that we sailed to?
10035120	10036120	Yes.
10036120	10039360	And do you remember the figurehead that Moomin liked best of all?
10039360	10042400	You know, the lady made of wood and painted.
10042400	10044560	She was really lovely, wasn't she?
10044560	10045560	Yes.
10045560	10046560	I remember.
10046560	10047760	Moomin wanted to keep it.
10047760	10048760	So what about it?
10048760	10050520	Well, it's here on the beach.
10050520	10054200	It was still the same asigi as ever.
10054200	10056000	Was it the same one?
10056000	10057000	Yes.
10057000	10058000	I remember her pretty face.
10058000	10059480	No legs, though.
10059480	10061240	She's just a silly wooden doll.
10061240	10065680	Oh, I know that, but she's got those gorgeous eyes in lovely long hair.
10065680	10069840	Little Mai, why all this fuss about this silly figurehead?
10069840	10070840	Trust him.
10070840	10074160	Only someone as stupid as Moomin could fall in love with a figurehead.
10074160	10076760	It's probably still dreaming about her every night.
10076760	10077760	Ah!
10077760	10078760	Do you think it's still there?
10078760	10079760	Charles Nork Maiden.
10079760	10084680	If no one else has found her already, do you think the ocean might come and wash her
10084680	10085680	away again?
10085680	10088760	Why all these silly questions, Nork Maiden?
10088760	10091840	Moomin would go and rescue her if he knew.
10091840	10092840	So?
10092840	10094040	That would be terrible.
10094040	10095600	I couldn't bear it at all.
10095600	10097600	I really couldn't.
10097600	10099120	How pathetic.
10099120	10104200	He'll probably take her home and keep her in his room forever.
10104200	10107240	My expect she's too big to go through the door.
10107240	10110440	He'll just sit and stare at her with that lovesick look on his face.
10110440	10111440	I know he will.
10111440	10112440	Oh!
10112440	10113440	Where are you going now?
10113440	10115680	I thought you were going to Moomin house.
10115680	10118880	I was, but there's something more important I have to do.
10124160	10125360	OK, it's clear.
10134880	10137880	Hey, you two, you're not leaving, are you?
10137880	10140160	No, we're just, uh, we're going.
10140160	10143960	Why have you got the suitcase, then?
10143960	10146360	Moomin, would you help us with something?
10146360	10147360	Of course.
10151000	10152880	Thank you very much, Moomin.
10152880	10154040	Oh, that's OK.
10154040	10156240	It's a bit too big for you to carry.
10156240	10158440	We can take it from here.
10158440	10159240	It's all right.
10159240	10160440	It's not very heavy.
10163120	10164320	Oh, silly me.
10164320	10167720	It wouldn't be a very secret place if I'd seen it, would it?
10167720	10169160	I'll see you later.
10169160	10170360	Don't be too long now.
10170360	10172320	How much you won't tell anyone, will you?
10172320	10173520	Of course, I won't.
10183120	10186120	Oh.
10186120	10188840	Hey, what are you doing up there, little lie?
10188840	10189960	I'm coming down.
10189960	10191880	What does it look like?
10191880	10194320	You're much too small to do that.
10194320	10196760	The rungs are too far apart for you to reach.
10196760	10198000	Just you watch me.
10209880	10211720	Moomin, I have a problem.
10211720	10213960	Do you mind if I ask you something?
10213960	10214800	Go ahead.
10214800	10217880	Did Moomin, Mama, give Snorkman's hard-shaped shell
10217880	10219040	to the grove?
10219040	10221480	Yes, she did.
10221480	10224640	So you and the grove can't both have it, can you?
10224640	10227400	That's just where you're wrong.
10227400	10229120	But that's simply impossible.
10229120	10230840	You can't have.
10230840	10233200	The grove simply got another one.
10233200	10235200	That's not true.
10235200	10235880	All right.
10235880	10238560	But it would only upset Snorkman if she knew.
10238560	10240480	So I'm not going to tell her.
10240480	10241760	You rotten thing.
10241760	10243640	Why don't you just tell me the truth?
10243640	10245160	Because it's a secret.
10245160	10247720	But I want to know, Moomin.
10247720	10251040	Look, Moomin, now why don't you tell me your secret?
10251040	10252760	And then I'll tell you mine.
10252760	10253560	What is it?
10253560	10255680	Really very top secret.
10255680	10258080	Go on, then, tell me.
10258080	10259480	Tell me yours first.
10259480	10261880	No, you tell me first.
10261880	10262360	I know.
10262360	10264000	Let's say them together.
10264000	10265160	All right.
10265160	10266640	Ready?
10266640	10267800	One, two, three.
10267800	10268320	One, two, three.
10268320	10270320	After we get the shell to the beach today,
10270320	10272480	we'll find something that you like.
10272480	10274440	Please, so I'll have the bigger head later.
10274440	10276480	We'll just like it.
10276480	10277400	What did you say?
10277400	10278120	The figure head?
10278120	10280880	Yes, by the K.
10280880	10281760	Wait a minute.
10281760	10284000	You didn't finish telling me your secret.
10284000	10285360	I'll tell you later.
10285360	10286400	That's not there.
10286400	10288160	You've got to tell me now.
10300320	10313040	What do you think, Moomin, Starlight?
10313040	10314880	I don't know.
10314880	10317160	Maybe he's looking for shells again.
10317160	10318760	I don't think so.
10318760	10321440	He looks a bit worried to me.
10321440	10330240	Maybe he's lost something important.
10330240	10332040	We have to go.
10332040	10333800	As far as you can road.
10333800	10336120	We're a long way out already, you know.
10336120	10339040	I want to make sure that the lady will never turn up again.
10339040	10341040	We must go further out.
10341040	10342880	We must be far enough by now.
10342880	10344200	I'm tired.
10344200	10347640	No, the Kurds could still drag her in from here.
10347640	10349280	Keep going.
10349280	10360160	He looks very unhappy.
10360160	10361160	You've got to cheer him up.
10361160	10362160	But how?
10362160	10364160	There's only one way, Bob.
10364160	10367160	Yes, you're right, thing of me.
10367160	10368160	Hello.
10368160	10384400	You look so sad, Moomin, that we thought we'd try and make you happy again.
10384400	10386600	You don't mind, do you?
10386600	10388600	No, but you don't have to.
10388600	10389600	I'm all right, really.
10389600	10390600	How about this, Dan Moomin?
10390600	10391600	We're going to show you what's in our suitcase.
10391600	10392600	Go.
10392600	10393600	Would you like that, Moomin?
10393600	10394600	It's very interesting.
10394600	10395600	Oh my gosh.
10395600	10396600	Will you?
10396600	10397600	Do you need some help in there?
10397600	10398600	No, I think we can manage.
10398600	10405600	I can't believe it.
10405600	10413600	I can't believe it.
10413600	10415600	Oh my gosh.
10415600	10416600	Will you?
10416600	10417600	Mmm.
10417600	10418600	I can't believe it.
10418600	10419600	I can't believe it.
10419600	10420600	I can't believe it.
10420600	10421600	I can't believe it.
10421600	10422600	I can't believe it.
10422600	10423600	I can't believe it.
10423600	10424600	I can't believe it.
10424600	10425600	I can't believe it.
10425600	10426600	I can't believe it.
10426600	10427600	I can't believe it.
10427600	10428600	Hey!
10428600	10429600	Oh gosh.
10429600	10430600	By my tail.
10430600	10433600	Do you like it?
10433600	10434600	Oh boy.
10434600	10435600	Do I like it?
10435600	10437600	Then you're not sad anymore, Moomin?
10437600	10438600	Oh no.
10438600	10439600	That's good, isn't it?
10439600	10440600	Yes, very good.
10440600	10441600	It was such a beautiful ruby.
10441600	10447600	How it changed color from soft red to soft blue and then to pink?
10447600	10449600	What minute it was like a fluke?
10449600	10450600	Oh no.
10450600	10451600	That's good, isn't it?
10451600	10452600	Yes, very good.
10452600	10453600	It was such a beautiful ruby.
10453600	10456600	How it changed color from soft red to soft blue and then to pink?
10456660	10459000	How minute it was like a flag leaping out of the center.
10459000	10461600	Then suddenly it was like a black tulip.
10461600	10462600	It was...
10462600	10463600	Hmm...
10463600	10465600	Perhaps that's the king's ruby.
10465600	10467600	It was just beautiful.
10467600	10470600	That's the one the Hobgoblin is searching for.
10470600	10471600	Oh no.
10471600	10473600	However far away he is.
10473600	10475680	He'll come back on his black panther.
10475680	10476680	Looking for it.
10476680	10478680	And he's sure to find it.
10478680	10481600	Because he'll know that Thbingamion Bob have it.
10481600	10482600	First the G Rover.
10482600	10483600	Now the Hobgoblin.
10483600	10485600	What are we going to do?
10485600	10495600	No more than a week later, and like a bolt from the blue, a real catastrophe hit Moomin Valley.
10500600	10504600	No, it's not in the bedroom either.
10504600	10507600	That's very odd. Where did you see it last?
10507600	10510600	I'm sure it was here somewhere, Papa.
10510600	10512600	Well, perhaps it's in the garden.
10513600	10516600	No, I haven't been out here all day.
10518600	10520600	Moomin Mama's handbag is missing.
10520600	10524600	Full of useful things like socks and sweets and string.
10528600	10529600	What's the matter, Mama?
10529600	10532600	I can't find my handbag and I'm lost without it.
10532600	10533600	We've looked everywhere.
10533600	10536600	Will I get a reward if I find it, Moomin Mama?
10537600	10541600	Yes, we'll have a big party for everyone with cakes, jelly, and everything.
10542600	10546600	And as a special treat, no one has to wash or go to bed early.
10546600	10549600	I'll find it, Mama. No, I will.
10555600	10558600	Moomin Mama, I've checked the cellar. It's not there.
10558600	10560600	Oh, dear. Where could it be?
10560600	10564600	I haven't been in the cellar for days, so I didn't think it would be there.
10564600	10566600	But thank you, dear snork.
10573600	10578600	Word got round Moomin Valley of the missing handbag.
10578600	10581600	And soon everyone was helping to look for it.
10584600	10586600	What a lot of people!
10586600	10588600	I wonder what they're looking for.
10597600	10599600	What's everybody looking for?
10600600	10602600	My handbag, thingamy.
10602600	10604600	The one with the two nice little pockets?
10604600	10607600	Yes, that's the one. It's been missing for days.
10607600	10609600	Will you two help us look?
10612600	10616600	It makes such a lovely place to sleep and don't you think?
10619600	10621600	Moomin Mama looks very sad.
10621600	10623600	Perhaps we better give it back.
10630600	10631600	Oh.
10641600	10644600	Oh, you found it.
10644600	10648600	Look, everybody, thingamy and Bob have found it.
10654600	10657600	Oh, thank you. Where on earth did you find it?
10658600	10660600	In the bush under the white birch tree.
10660600	10663600	It's a very, very nice handbag.
10663600	10668600	Let's have a party tonight to celebrate the return of Mama's handbag.
10670600	10676600	As you all know, this party is in honor of thingamy and Bob finding Moomin Mama's handbag.
10676600	10680600	And to thank everyone who took part in the big search.
10680600	10682600	Let's raise our glasses to our heroes.
10682600	10689600	Here's the thingamy and Bob who found Moomin Mama's handbag without which Moomin Valley would never be the same again.
10689600	10691600	Cheers!
10699600	10702600	Now, I think Moomin would like to say a few words.
10702600	10703600	A moment.
10703600	10707600	We're very pleased that Mama's handbag is back again.
10707600	10710600	And thank you to our northern friends, thingamy and Bob.
10710600	10713600	You're seeing as how this is a very special occasion.
10713600	10717600	And also, as a thank you for the party, they have decided to show us what is in their suitcase.
10717600	10720600	And I'm sure you'll all be astounded by what you see.
10720600	10725600	Ha! Come closer, everyone. Now, thingamy and Bob, are you ready?
10730600	10732600	Ready, everyone?
10732600	10733600	Ready, everyone?
10733600	10734600	One, two, three.
10737600	10739600	How wonderful.
10739600	10744600	I don't know how the growth could swap that for an old seashell.
10746600	10750600	By my, that must be the King's Ruby.
10765600	10767600	The King's Ruby, I found it.
10769600	10771600	It's the Hub Goblin!
10775600	10778600	Yes, this is it. The Ruby I've sworn to find.
10778600	10779600	Huh?
10779600	10781600	Don't touch it! It's ours!
10781600	10784600	Go away, you nasty Hub Goblin.
10784600	10787600	But that King's Ruby belongs only to me.
10787600	10794600	No, it doesn't. The growth gave it to singamy and Bob in fair exchange for a heart-shaped shell, Mr. Hub Goblin.
10794600	10796600	Did he say a heart-shaped shell?
10796600	10798600	I think so.
10798600	10801600	Anyway, I saw her give it to them with my own eyes.
10801600	10804600	Show it belongs to them, not you.
10804600	10810600	I've spent 300 years day and night searching everywhere for this Ruby.
10810600	10813600	Well, that's very sad, but it still is.
10813600	10818600	Now then, let's see. Would you exchange the Ruby for, say, two diamond mines?
10818600	10821600	No! We don't mind anything else!
10827600	10832600	No, I can't do it. I can't take it by force.
10833600	10837600	It's been so long. What can I do?
10847600	10851600	Would you like some punch? It's very nice.
10852600	10857600	That's very kind of you, woman mama. I haven't had any for 85 years.
10864600	10866600	Ah, quince.
10866600	10870600	That's part of it, Mr. Hub Goblin. Have some more, please.
10870600	10874600	No, thank you. Hub Goblins don't really drink very much.
10874600	10880600	Well, this is a splendid punch and a splendid party. In return, I shall show you a little magic.
10881600	10886600	I will give out three presents. Now what I can do is grant three wishes,
10886600	10890600	so I want three of you to come forward and make a wish.
10890600	10893600	You're not afraid, are you?
10894600	10898600	How you look old enough not to be frightened, Mr. Emulan?
10898600	10906600	Just let me think. Oh, yes, Mr. Hub Goblin. I broke the spade I borrowed from woman papa.
10906600	10909600	No, Mr. Himmelan, have you ever make a proper wish?
10910600	10912600	I would like a new spade, if you please.
10912600	10915600	Very well, here you are.
10915600	10920600	Oh, thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Hub Goblin.
10920600	10922600	Here you are, woman papa.
10922600	10924600	Right, who's next?
10924600	10926600	Excuse me?
10928600	10931600	Yes, and what can I do for you, young lady?
10931600	10934600	Well, I'm afraid it might be a little difficult.
10934600	10936600	For me?
10937600	10939600	Is that really what you want?
10939600	10940600	Please.
10940600	10942600	All right, then close your eyes.
10943600	10946600	Your wish has now come true, young lady.
10948600	10949600	Oh!
10949600	10951600	Oh, snorke-may.
10951600	10953600	Oh, snorke-may done.
10953600	10957600	I've wanted eyes like that, wouldn't lady you think is so beautiful?
10957600	10959600	Do you think I'm beautiful now, woman?
10959600	10963600	Well, I, well, give me a mirror, someone.
10963600	10965600	They're quite nice, really.
10967600	10969600	What?
10969600	10971600	Huh?
10971600	10973600	Huh?
10973600	10976600	This is horrible, horrible.
10976600	10980600	Please, Mr. Hub Goblin, please give me my eyes back.
10980600	10984600	I'm sorry, but I can only grant one wish per person.
10984600	10988600	Oh, that's really me, no, please.
10988600	10992600	Mr. Hub Goblin, can I make a wish now?
10992600	10995600	Certainly, a golden chariot, a rock crystal goblin.
10996600	10998600	Anything at all.
10998600	11001600	A sack full of gold coins, you can be rich, woman.
11001600	11002600	Really rich.
11002600	11005600	I'm sorry, but movements is the last wish.
11005600	11008600	I know, why don't you ask for two sackfuls of gold, woman?
11008600	11010600	Then we can have one each, what do you think?
11010600	11013600	No, sniff, I know what I'm going to wish.
11013600	11014600	Oh, man.
11014600	11019600	Mr. Hub Goblin, please change snorke-mayden's eyes back to her own.
11019600	11023600	Never mind her, she can see all right, get the gold coins.
11023600	11026600	The wish is made and fulfilled.
11029600	11031600	There you are, have a look.
11031600	11035600	Oh, now next time, think before you make a wish.
11035600	11037600	Moment.
11040600	11042600	Mr. Hub Goblin?
11042600	11043600	Yes, think of me.
11043600	11048600	If you can grant wishes like that, why don't you make a wish for yourself?
11048600	11052600	I'm afraid my magic only works for other people.
11052600	11055600	Mr. Hub Goblin, can we make a wish for you then?
11055600	11057600	Please say we can't, please.
11057600	11058600	I suppose so.
11058600	11060600	Oh, please, it's important.
11060600	11063600	Very well, as it is not for you.
11063600	11066600	We wish for a movie just like yours.
11066600	11068600	You shall have it.
11074600	11077600	This is for you, Hub Goblin.
11078600	11081600	Oh, thank you, thank you.
11083600	11088600	And so that was how, after 300 years, the Hub Goblin search came to an end,
11088600	11092600	and Moomin Valley had never had such a celebration.
11092600	11099600	Everyone was happy, except possibly Sniff, who would have quite liked a sack full of gold coins.
11112600	11123600	They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.
11123600	11131600	Believing in sharing, and caring, and giving the movements.
11131600	11135600	They're always happy, and always at play.
11135600	11142600	Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.
11142600	11146600	The Moomin's.
11146600	11153600	They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.
11153600	11160600	Believing in sharing, and caring, and giving the movements.
11160600	11164600	They're always happy, and always at play.
11164600	11171600	The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.
11171600	11175600	The Moomin's.
11175600	11181600	The Moomin's.
11190600	11202600	Here they are for one and all.
11202600	11205600	The Moomin's are about to call.
11205600	11208600	Come on and sit down here with me.
11208600	11211600	They're for you on your TV.
11211600	11213600	They are the movements.
11213600	11216600	They are the movements.
11217600	11220600	So come with me, give me your hand.
11220600	11223600	I'll take you up to Moomin land.
11223600	11226600	You can fly just like a bird.
11226600	11228600	Sing that song ever.
11228600	11231600	There were the movements.
11231600	11234600	There were the movements.
11234600	11237600	There were the movements.
11237600	11240600	There were the movements.
11240600	11243600	There were the movements.
11243600	11246600	There were the movements.
11273600	11276600	There were the movements.
11276600	11279600	There were the movements.
11304600	11306600	Come on man, you were here already.
11306600	11310600	This is Moomin house.
11310600	11321600	It has been raining since lunchtime, and Moomin and his friends had spent all afternoon in Moomin house, waiting for the sun to come out.
11321600	11326600	So, Tiki's arrival was very welcome.
11326600	11328600	Good evening, Moomin.
11328600	11332600	Tiki, come here.
11332600	11335600	Mama, don't take his hair.
11335600	11337600	Come on in, Mani.
11337600	11340600	I need Moomin.
11340600	11343600	Is there someone with you?
11343600	11345600	Yes, I brought my friend, Mani.
11345600	11349600	Mani, don't be shy.
11349600	11351600	Well, there's no one there.
11351600	11352600	Yes, there is.
11352600	11354600	You just can't see her.
11354600	11355600	Really?
11355600	11359600	Yes, I'm afraid she's very, very shy.
11359600	11362600	I'll leave the door open for you, Mani.
11362600	11364600	Come in when you're ready.
11364600	11366600	She'll get soaked if she stays out there.
11366600	11370600	Maybe that doesn't matter very much if you're invisible.
11370600	11373600	Oh.
11373600	11378600	Too Tiki, how nice.
11378600	11385600	What is everyone looking at?
11385600	11389600	About Mani, you know sometimes when people are very frightened,
11389600	11393600	they can become invisible to the people around them.
11393600	11397600	Poor Mani, she's looked after by an aunt who doesn't like her,
11397600	11402600	and is really horrible to her and who only does it because she thinks it's her duty.
11402600	11406600	It wouldn't be so bad if she just got mad and yelled at her,
11406600	11409600	but she's cold and sarcastic, which is much worse.
11409600	11414600	She doesn't care if Mani is unhappy and gives her horrible jobs.
11414600	11417600	What's sarcastic?
11417600	11419600	Uh, let's see.
11419600	11421600	Suppose you tripped and fell over.
11421600	11423600	What would Mum and Mama say?
11423600	11426600	Well, she does me a fight hurt myself.
11426600	11429600	Yes, well, you're lucky that Mum and Mama is so nice,
11429600	11431600	but a lot of people would be mad at you.
11431600	11435600	Now, this nasty old lady would say that maybe you're right, dear of dancing,
11435600	11439600	but try not to do it when people are eaten, please.
11439600	11441600	Gosh, that's horrible.
11441600	11445600	Anyway, she just went on being more and more horrible to her,
11445600	11450600	so that in the end, Nini was so upset she became invisible.
11450600	11454600	And our aunt said she couldn't be bothered to look after little girl she couldn't see.
11454600	11457600	Poor Nini.
11457600	11459600	So she asked me to do it.
11459600	11461600	Nini's still outside.
11461600	11465600	Too nervous to come in.
11465600	11467600	But what did you do to this old aunt?
11467600	11470600	I hope you told her she heard Nini's feelings.
11470600	11474600	He wouldn't have done any good, not with someone like her.
11474600	11478600	So I took Nini home, and then as you're the nicest family I know,
11478600	11481600	I brought her here so you could make her visible again.
11481600	11484600	You were very flattered, of course, too, Tiki, but...
11484600	11487600	If anyone can do it, you and Mum and Mama can.
11487600	11489600	And Mum can play with her.
11489600	11491600	Does she talk at all to Tiki?
11491600	11494600	I'm afraid not. Not since she became invisible.
11494600	11495600	Oh, dear.
11495600	11499600	I'm sure I can think of lots of games, but it'll be hard to play
11499600	11503600	if I can't see her. She'll be really good at hide and seek, though.
11503600	11510600	Oh, it's okay. You'll know where she is because her aunt hung a little bell around her neck.
11513600	11516600	Oh, look, the door's opened.
11516600	11519600	That'll be Nini.
11521600	11526600	Come in, Nini. It's all right. Don't be frightened.
11526600	11533600	Come and meet everyone. This is your new home, and this is Mum and Mama and Mum and Papa.
11533600	11535600	They're both very nice.
11535600	11538600	Hello, I'm Mum and these are my friends.
11541600	11544600	We were just having some tea. Would you like some?
11544600	11547600	Oh, that is, if you can drink.
11547600	11551600	Oh, perhaps I should make some lemonade.
11552600	11557600	Well, now, perhaps you'd all like to go back to the table.
11557600	11560600	If you'd care to sit down, Nini.
11563600	11570600	I'm sorry I don't know any more about her, but I'm sure that everything will be okay now she's here.
11570600	11572600	I'm certain it will.
11572600	11575600	We'll do our best, Tiki.
11577600	11579600	Here you are, Nini.
11582600	11588600	Well, she seems to be okay now, so I'd better be getting along.
11588600	11594600	I've got a lot of things to do. I'll try and come over to see how you're all going.
11594600	11597600	That would really be nice.
11600600	11602600	Oh, it's better.
11602600	11606600	You have got room, haven't you? Didn't you have someone else stand?
11606600	11612600	Ah, yes, thing I mean Bob, but it's alright. They left last week.
11612600	11615600	That's okay then.
11617600	11623600	Oh, you must have been thirsty. Would you like some more?
11623600	11625600	Sure.
11637600	11642600	Oh, are you coming up with me?
11642600	11645600	That's nice, Nini.
11652600	11659600	This is your very own room. You'll be warm and cozy here.
11659600	11665600	I've put the lemonade on the table so you can have a drink whenever you want.
11666600	11670600	Are you sure you wouldn't like something to eat?
11670600	11673600	Ah, I see, you want to go to bed.
11673600	11676600	Well, you had a busy day, so you must be tired out.
11676600	11680600	And don't forget, if you feel frightened or lonely during the night,
11680600	11683600	just come and wake me up and we'll have a talk.
11683600	11690600	If you like, you can tinkle your little bell in my ear and that should do it many dear.
11690600	11694600	Sweet dreams, sleep well.
11697600	11699600	She asleep?
11699600	11702600	Yes.
11702600	11708600	I was wondering whether there's anything that might help her in your granny's book of household remedies.
11708600	11713600	I don't know if there's a cure for invisibility. I can't remember, but I'll have a look.
11713600	11717600	There's a remedy for most things.
11717600	11720600	I'm a phone believer in granny's remedy.
11720600	11724600	I know you are dear. I'll go and see.
11724600	11728600	I wonder what you looked like.
11728600	11731600	Hmm. Hmm.
11735600	11737600	Ah, there it is.
11737600	11742600	Now then, a droopy tail, evil eye, melancholy.
11742600	11745600	Ah, this must be it.
11755600	11763600	The prescription was at the end of the book and shakily written, but it looked like the right one.
11763600	11770600	It said, remedy for when people start getting misty and difficult to see.
11770600	11774600	It was very complicated.
11785600	11790600	Do you think it's going to work, Mama?
11790600	11794600	Granny's remedies usually do, so don't worry.
11794600	11796600	Yes, you're right.
11796600	11800600	I wonder whether we ought to go and wake her up.
11815600	11819600	Look, you can send in these shoes.
11830600	11832600	Papa! Papa!
11832600	11834600	Oh, good morning, little Mai.
11834600	11836600	Is Ninny up yet?
11836600	11838600	Yeah, she is.
11838600	11841600	Where is she? She hasn't eaten yet, has she?
11841600	11844600	I don't know, and she's probably in the dining room.
11844600	11847600	Oh, no!
11853600	11855600	I'm too late!
11855600	11857600	I'd be quiet, you two.
11857600	11860600	Ninny is just finishing her breakfast.
11860600	11864600	Come on, drink it all up.
11866600	11867600	That's good.
11867600	11871600	It should start to work in a couple of hours. Well done, Ninny.
11871600	11874600	Look, her shoes are floating.
11874600	11877600	Yeah, the seal will be seeing little bit seeing the rest of her.
11877600	11879600	Ha, they look silly.
11879600	11881600	I think they're very nice feet.
11881600	11885600	I know and woman, Mama's remedies are good, but I can't see them working that fast.
11885600	11889600	Anyway, you must look pretty bad if you want to make yourself invisible.
11889600	11893600	Don't let little Mai upset you, Ninny. It's only the way she talks.
11893600	11894600	She doesn't mean it.
11894600	11898600	Oh, yes I do. I'm bored, Moomin.
11898600	11900600	Well, what shall we do then, Moomin?
11900600	11903600	I don't know. Let's go mushroom picking.
11903600	11905600	That's boring, I never find any.
11905600	11907600	Well, I do.
11907600	11909600	Would you like to come, Ninny?
11909600	11913600	Good, and we can see who can pick the most, shall we?
11913600	11918600	They all look the same to me, so you'll have to tell me which ones are safe to eat.
11921600	11923600	I'll tell you.
11925600	11928600	Papa! Papa!
11928600	11931600	Look Papa, you can see Ninny's shoes now.
11931600	11935600	Oh, that's good. There's not many things Mama's potions won't cure.
11935600	11938600	Oh, it can't be that. She only took it a minute ago.
11938600	11942600	Well, it might be that it works faster if you're completely invisible.
11942600	11945600	I think it's being away from that horrid ant.
11945600	11947600	Yes, it could.
11947600	11950600	Mama, we're taking Ninny mushroom picking.
11950600	11952600	Have a nice time.
11952600	11954600	Morning!
11954600	11956600	Morning!
11956600	11958600	Hello!
11958600	11961600	Where's Ninny?
11978600	11981600	Oh!
11989600	11992600	Oh!
11995600	11998600	Wow, what a lot of mushrooms!
12002600	12006600	You seem to know where to find all the best ones, Ninny.
12007600	12010600	It's not fair. I haven't gotten half as many.
12010600	12013600	How are you doing, Momen?
12013600	12018600	Wow, that must be about four times as many as I've got.
12018600	12021600	Yeah, that's right.
12021600	12024600	You've never picked that many before.
12024600	12028600	You know, Momen, I think there's something fishy about this.
12030600	12033600	Uh-huh, so they're not yours at all.
12034600	12037600	Well, not really, no.
12038600	12040600	Ninny's enjoyed herself.
12040600	12043600	I'd better yak you old ant never let her go mushroom picking.
12043600	12047600	She was probably only allowed to carry the baskets, the really heavy ones.
12047600	12050600	Oh, how awful for her.
12054600	12057600	They're stinky. What's he up to now?
12057600	12060600	I'll take care of him.
12060600	12062600	Hello, Momen, long time no see.
12062600	12066600	Not long enough. Last time you dipped my swimming shorts in glue.
12066600	12069600	You know, I thought that was very funny.
12069600	12072600	Hey, what's that basket floating around up there for?
12072600	12075600	I don't want to be rude, but mind your own business.
12075600	12077600	It looks like the Hobgoblins work.
12077600	12080600	Boy, just think of all the things you could do if you were invisible.
12080600	12083600	Ninny, I'll carry your basket. Let's go.
12083600	12086600	It stinks here.
12086600	12090600	Hey, you! Is Ninny a name or just a description?
12090600	12093600	What's wrong? Is your voice invisible, too?
12093600	12096600	Please stop it, stinky. Can't you see you're frightening her?
12096600	12100600	Oh, it's a girl, is it? Why doesn't she speak for herself?
12100600	12104600	She's stupid. What a perfect name for her, Ninny.
12104600	12106600	Now look, stinky.
12106600	12108600	Oh, yes, Momen, now look what?
12108600	12112600	You stop upsetting Ninny or I'll get really angry.
12112600	12115600	Without those feet, she'd be perfect for a bank robbery.
12115600	12119600	Well, she's getting visible again, so she'll be no good to you at all, stinky.
12119600	12122600	You couldn't see any of her yesterday, not even the feet.
12122600	12125600	Oh, they're disappearing again.
12125600	12128600	You have to do a scare of it.
12128600	12132600	Oh, see, she's gone.
12132600	12134600	It's all your fault, stinky.
12134600	12138600	Yes, and like I told you before, she'd make a brilliant bank robbery.
12138600	12142600	Don't you agree? Perfect.
12142600	12145600	Ninny would never do such a thing as that.
12145600	12148600	Anyway, Mama's given her one of Granny's magic remedies.
12148600	12151600	She'll soon be visible again, so they're there.
12159600	12161600	Whose basket is this?
12161600	12163600	Mine in little mice.
12163600	12166600	Well, there's not many of them, but they certainly are pretty.
12166600	12171600	There weren't many left for us to get, because Ninny has picked them all.
12171600	12174600	It doesn't really matter how many you've got, because you can't eat them.
12174600	12177600	Let me show you.
12177600	12179600	Now, this is deadly, tufted toadstool.
12179600	12181600	And this is cow's bane.
12181600	12185600	You must remember what they look like.
12185600	12188600	These are movements and sniff, I should think.
12188600	12190600	We didn't pick any poisoners ones.
12190600	12194600	Not quite as many as snorkemaiden and little mice, but this is body fly bane
12194600	12196600	and insiduous pepper spunk.
12196600	12198600	And you've both got cow's bane, too.
12198600	12200600	You must be more careful.
12200600	12201600	Now, this is better.
12201600	12204600	There's not one mushroom in here that you can't eat.
12204600	12207600	How did Ninny manage to do this all on her own?
12207600	12210600	What a very clever girl she is.
12210600	12213600	Ninny, where are you? Come here a minute.
12213600	12216600	Ninny, didn't you hear? Mama wants you.
12219600	12222600	Ninny, this is a beautiful mushroom basket.
12222600	12224600	We'll have a feast tonight.
12226600	12228600	Her feet have come back.
12229600	12231600	Oh, I'm so glad.
12231600	12233600	We'll soon be able to see your face.
12233600	12235600	It won't take long at all, Ninny.
12235600	12238600	And you mustn't worry about stinky one little bit.
12238600	12240600	He's all talk.
12240600	12243600	If something upsets you, just think of something else.
12243600	12246600	At least that's my philosophy in life.
12246600	12248600	If somebody upsets you, ignore him.
12248600	12250600	That's my philosophy, Ninny.
12250600	12254600	Anyone who picks mushrooms like this deserves to be seen.
12254600	12257600	You mustn't let anything frighten you when you're with us.
12257600	12259600	Do you understand?
12262600	12265600	Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.
12265600	12267600	That's just great, Ninny.
12267600	12269600	Oh, that's wonderful, Ninny, wonderful.
12269600	12271600	I can't wait to see all of you.
12271600	12273600	It won't be long now.
12273600	12276600	But I don't think Mouse Gray is quite your color, you know.
12288600	12290600	You just sleep as long as you like, Ninny.
12290600	12291600	Good night now.
12291600	12293600	If you want anything, you just shout.
12318600	12319600	Oh.
12331600	12333600	Oh, where's Mom and Mama?
12347600	12352600	Well, well, what are you doing?
12352600	12354600	Do you know what time it is?
12354600	12356600	Do you like this movement, Papa?
12356600	12357600	Hmm.
12357600	12360600	Yes, it's very nice.
12360600	12362600	It's good to have someone in the house
12362600	12364600	to make clothes for at last.
12364600	12366600	I hope it'll look pretty on her.
12366600	12367600	What's this for?
12367600	12368600	Her hair.
12378600	12379600	Oh!
12399600	12401600	Good morning, movement, Papa!
12401600	12402600	Good morning, little my.
12402600	12403600	You're very early today.
12403600	12404600	Where's Nini?
12404600	12406600	Still in bed.
12407600	12408600	You're a burly?
12408600	12410600	I can't wait to see her.
12410600	12411600	Come on, man.
12417600	12420600	It's like waiting for Christmas, isn't it?
12420600	12423600	Yeah, I like having presents every day.
12423600	12424600	Isn't it, Papa?
12424600	12428600	Well, I think it's much more exciting this way.
12428600	12431600	We have to wait until she's ready to come down.
12431600	12434600	Did you hear that door opening?
12434600	12436600	She's awake!
12437600	12441600	I hope she found the dress where I left it on the table.
12442600	12444600	It's so hot!
12462600	12464600	Oh, good.
12464600	12465600	It's all right.
12465600	12467600	Now you know where to look.
12467600	12472600	Well, she's okay, I suppose.
12477600	12480600	Thank you all very much for everything.
12480600	12484600	Oh! Ha! So she can talk!
12488600	12490600	They still couldn't see Nini's face,
12490600	12493600	but at least they knew that she was there,
12493600	12495600	and that she was talking to them.
12495600	12497600	I made them all feel a lot better.
12497600	12499600	Stork made them! Look!
12525600	12527600	They're always happy and always at play.
12527600	12531600	The movements are having fun day after day.
12531600	12534600	The movements.
12534600	12537600	The movements.
12537600	12542600	They love the laughter and they love the living.
12542600	12545600	The movements.
12545600	12550600	You're leaving and sharing and caring and giving.
12550600	12552600	The movements.
12552600	12556600	They're always happy and always at play.
12556600	12560600	The movements are having fun day after day.
12560600	12562600	The movements.
12562600	12564600	The movements.
12564600	12566600	The movements.
12566600	12570600	The movements.
12570600	12574600	The movements.
12574600	12578600	The movements.
12578600	12580600	The movements.
12608600	12612600	The movements.
12612600	12614600	The movements.
12614600	12616600	The movements.
12616600	12618600	The movements.
12618600	12620600	The movements.
12620600	12622600	The movements.
12622600	12624600	The movements.
12624600	12626600	The movements.

12634600	12636600	The movements.
12636600	12638600	There were the movements.
12638600	12640600	There was the movements.

12703600	12705600	Where's Danny?
12705600	12707600	I asked her if she wanted to play with us,
12707600	12709600	and she said yes!
12711600	12713600	Danny, come on!
12713600	12715600	We're going to have some fun!
12727600	12729600	Right, let's go!
12729600	12735600	Danny, who became invisible because of her sarcastic aunt,
12735600	12737600	was now visible up to the neck.
12737600	12739600	But no matter how much of Granny's remedy she took,
12739600	12741600	or how nice the movements were to her,
12741600	12745600	her hips still remained invisible.
12745600	12747600	That's the invisible child.
12747600	12749600	I wonder what she really looks like.
12749600	12751600	Well, good morning, everybody!
12751600	12753600	Morning, lazy bones!
12753600	12755600	We've been up for hours and hours!
12755600	12757600	We're going to play hide-and-seek in the woods!
12757600	12759600	Great!
12759600	12761600	Ninny, come on!
12761600	12763600	We're going to play hide-and-seek in the woods!
12763600	12765600	That's the invisible child!
12765600	12767600	I wonder what she really looks like!
12767600	12769600	Well, good morning, everybody!
12769600	12771600	Morning, lazy bones!
12771600	12773600	We've been up for hours and hours!
12773600	12775600	Great!
12775600	12777600	Ninny, are you all right?
12777600	12779600	Yes, thanks!
12779600	12781600	This is dumb!
12781600	12783600	If I could see your face, I wouldn't have to ask!
12783600	12785600	Doesn't help with you, Sniff!
12785600	12787600	You always ask silly questions!
12803600	12807600	It's a bit big for hide-and-seek, isn't it?
12807600	12811600	But that's what's so good about it!
12815600	12817600	Okay, this is a good place to start,
12817600	12819600	but we've got a new rule for the game.
12819600	12821600	Once you find somewhere to hide,
12821600	12823600	you've got to stay in the same place,
12823600	12825600	no moving about anyone.
12825600	12827600	Do you understand, Ninny?
12827600	12829600	Right, you're to go first, Sniff!
12829600	12831600	Huh? Why isn't always me first?
12831600	12833600	We'll have a practice for Ninny's sake,
12833600	12835600	show her what to do.
12835600	12837600	Uh, hide-and-seek is an easy game!
12837600	12839600	Not for Ninny, it isn't!
12839600	12841600	She's never played it before!
12841600	12843600	What? Never ever?
12843600	12845600	No, and not just hide-and-seek!
12845600	12847600	She hasn't played any games at all!
12847600	12849600	Not even when she was visible?
12849600	12851600	No, nothing!
12851600	12853600	Oh, that's terrible!
12853600	12855600	So, will you go first?
12855600	12857600	No, I won't!
12857600	12859600	Count to 10 slowly,
12859600	12861600	so you'll have plenty of time to find somewhere!
12861600	12863600	One!
12863600	12865600	Two!
12865600	12867600	Three!
12869600	12871600	Go on, Ninny, hurry up!
12871600	12873600	Four!
12875600	12877600	Five!
12879600	12881600	I can still see you!
12883600	12885600	Six!
12887600	12891600	Seven!
12891600	12893600	Good!
12893600	12895600	Good!
12895600	12897600	Eight!
12899600	12901600	Nine!
12905600	12907600	Two!
12907600	12909600	Hello, Ninny!
12909600	12911600	Don't be frightened!
12911600	12913600	Why don't you hide in that bush over there?
12913600	12915600	He'll never find you!
12915600	12917600	I'm coming!
12917600	12919600	Thank you!
12933600	12935600	Ouch, my tail!
12935600	12937600	Got you, Sniff!
12937600	12939600	Eh!
12945600	12947600	Huh?
12949600	12951600	Huh?
12951600	12953600	Huh?
12957600	12959600	Hmm?
12959600	12961600	Ah!
12965600	12967600	Hehehe!
12975600	12977600	Huh?
12977600	12979600	Huh?
12987600	12989600	Got you, Little Mike!
12989600	12991600	No!
12991600	12993600	I'd like to know where Ninny's hiding!
12997600	12999600	Oh, look!
12999600	13001600	Oh!
13005600	13007600	Ah, come out, Ninny!
13007600	13009600	I've got you!
13009600	13011600	That was a good place, but I saw your ribbon!
13011600	13013600	Oh!
13013600	13015600	Now for Snort Maiden!
13015600	13017600	She's always easy to find!
13019600	13021600	Ha!
13021600	13023600	That's only because she wants to be found!
13023600	13025600	Found you, Snort Maiden!
13025600	13027600	One!
13031600	13033600	Two!
13033600	13037600	Three!
13037600	13039600	Don't wait, Ninny!
13039600	13041600	This is my bush!
13041600	13045600	Four!
13049600	13051600	Hey, Ninny!
13051600	13053600	I'll show you a good place!
13053600	13055600	Just come with your ankles stinky!
13063600	13067600	Now don't worry, no one will find you there!
13067600	13069600	It opens up once you're inside!
13069600	13071600	Come on!
13071600	13073600	It's a bit steep, I'll help you!
13081600	13083600	Oh!
13087600	13089600	Right! That should keep you quiet!
13089600	13091600	You're a bit too visible at the moment!
13091600	13093600	Oh, let me out!
13093600	13097600	But I'm sure if you stay here until tomorrow, no one will see it all!
13097600	13099600	Please don't leave me here!
13099600	13101600	Please!
13109600	13111600	Ha! That's it!
13111600	13113600	Now tomorrow we'll hit the bank!
13121600	13123600	Let me out!
13123600	13125600	Please let me out!
13127600	13131600	I'm very glad I thought of bringing Ninny here!
13131600	13133600	It's nice to have her here too, Tiki!
13133600	13135600	She's no trouble at all!
13135600	13137600	You're all pretty eccentric!
13137600	13141600	And it might be just what she needs to make her want to be seen again!
13141600	13143600	And you're very kind, of course!
13143600	13145600	Well, thank you!
13145600	13147600	I think I suppose we should be flattered, shouldn't we?
13147600	13149600	Oh, yes, definitely!
13149600	13153600	She started to talk, but her voice is very weak!
13153600	13155600	You have to listen very carefully!
13155600	13157600	Has it always been like that?
13157600	13159600	Or just since she was invisible?
13159600	13161600	I'm not sure I don't think it was like that before!
13161600	13165600	Lots of people manage very well without using their heads, so I'm certain Ninny will be all right!
13165600	13169600	Yes, and I'm glad she's got Moomin and the others to play with!
13169600	13171600	She's never had anybody before, you know?
13171600	13175600	I think she'd find it a bit difficult to Tiki!
13175600	13177600	Well, Mum and Mama, I think that all she needs is something to shock her out of it!
13177600	13179600	Huh, got you little, my!
13179600	13181600	Oh! That bush was too prickly anyway!
13181600	13183600	I expect I'm the last one, hey!
13183600	13185600	No, I haven't found Ninny yet!
13185600	13187600	Ninny!
13187600	13189600	I didn't think Ninny would hide so well!
13189600	13191600	And he lucked, Sniff!
13191600	13193600	There's nowhere else to look, Moomin!
13193600	13195600	Perhaps she's lost or fallen or hurt herself!
13195600	13197600	Well, I've looked absolutely everywhere!
13197600	13199600	I bet she's invisible again!
13199600	13201600	That's why I can't find her!
13201600	13203600	I bet, Sniff!
13203600	13205600	I bet Sniff hasn't looked everywhere!
13205600	13207600	She can't be far!
13207600	13209600	Do you know where she is, Moomin?
13209600	13211600	No, I haven't seen her at all!
13211600	13213600	Not since we started!
13215600	13217600	Ninny!
13217600	13219600	Come on! We're going home!
13219600	13221600	We've finished playing!
13221600	13223600	Ninny!
13223600	13225600	Oh, my goodness! Where could she be?
13225600	13227600	Ninny!
13227600	13229600	She's your turn, Sniff!
13229600	13231600	You've got to find her!
13231600	13233600	Never mind, we'll all look!
13233600	13235600	We must find her!
13235600	13237600	We are supposed to be looking after her, you know?
13239600	13241600	Oh, come on, Ninny!
13241600	13243600	The game's over!
13243600	13245600	We've finished!
13245600	13247600	Ninny!
13247600	13249600	Ninny!
13249600	13251600	Hurry up!
13251600	13255600	We're going home for cookies and lemonade!
13255600	13257600	Ninny!
13257600	13259600	Ah!
13265600	13267600	Ninny!
13267600	13269600	Ninny!
13269600	13271600	Can you hear us?
13271600	13273600	We weren't supposed to come this far, Snort Maiden.
13273600	13277600	She might be really lost or frightened or anything!
13277600	13279600	Ninny!
13279600	13281600	Where are you, Ninny?
13281600	13283600	Can you hear me?
13283600	13285600	Ninny!
13285600	13286600	Help! I'm over here!
13286600	13290600	Did you hear something?
13290600	13292600	I'm not sure!
13292600	13294600	Help! Help! I'm here!
13294600	13296600	Help!
13296600	13298600	That's her!
13298600	13300600	She's not far away!
13300600	13302600	Ninny! Where are you?
13302600	13304600	Here! Behind this rock!
13304600	13306600	Where's her voice coming from?
13306600	13308600	That way, I think!
13308600	13310600	Ninny!
13310600	13312600	I can't hear what you're saying!
13312600	13314600	Try and shout a bit louder!
13314600	13316600	Over here! Over here!
13316600	13318600	Behind the rock!
13318600	13320600	I still can't hear properly!
13320600	13322600	Louder, Ninny! Louder!
13322600	13324600	Behind the rock!
13324600	13326600	Which rock?
13326600	13328600	Over here!
13328600	13330600	The big rock!
13330600	13332600	Over there!
13332600	13336600	I've never shouted so much in my life!
13336600	13338600	Ninny!
13338600	13342600	Ninny, are you behind this rock, Ninny?
13342600	13344600	Stinky block the cave with it!
13344600	13346600	Don't worry, we'll get you out!
13346600	13348600	Hang on!
13354600	13356600	Are you all right, Ninny?
13356600	13358600	Thank you, Mummin!
13358600	13360600	Oh, thank you!
13360600	13362600	Your voice seems to be...
13362600	13364600	Oh, what?
13364600	13366600	Oh, nothing!
13366600	13368600	Try and hold on to me, and I'll pull you out!
13368600	13370600	Oh, thank you!
13370600	13372600	Oh, thank you!
13376600	13378600	Hey, what's happened?
13378600	13380600	Where'd you find her?
13380600	13382600	In the cave!
13382600	13386600	Wow, what a brilliant hiding place had you find it!
13386600	13388600	What's wrong?
13388600	13390600	Did I say something funny?
13392600	13394600	Now, that was very mean of stinking.
13394600	13398600	The clever idea, though, of interuser for a ban robbery.
13398600	13400600	Oh, Papa!
13400600	13402600	Oh, I know Stinky shouldn't have done it,
13402600	13404600	and it must have been a nasty shopping,
13404600	13406600	trapped in the dark in that cave,
13406600	13408600	but no real harm came to her,
13408600	13410600	and she didn't disappear,
13410600	13412600	and her voice got much stronger.
13412600	13414600	Because she yelled so loud!
13414600	13416600	Goodness, did you, dear?
13416600	13418600	Yes, Mummin, Mama!
13418600	13420600	Mummin told me to yell loudly,
13420600	13422600	so he'd know where I was!
13422600	13424600	And it was loud, too!
13424600	13426600	Good for you, Ninny!
13426600	13428600	You have to, and you ought to remember,
13428600	13432600	that people who speak loudly are usually very noticeable.
13432600	13434600	Go on, yell! I want to see it!
13434600	13436600	That's a good idea, Ninny!
13436600	13438600	If shouting brought back your voice,
13438600	13440600	you never know it might be just what's needed
13440600	13442600	to make the rest of you visible!
13442600	13444600	Try and get angry as well!
13444600	13446600	Yeah, that's easy! Just think about Stinky!
13446600	13448600	Yeah, and how horrible he is!
13448600	13450600	That should make you angry!
13450600	13452600	Very angry!
13452600	13454600	Just you wait, Stinky!
13454600	13456600	I can't help faster than me!
13460600	13462600	Stinky, wait!
13462600	13464600	We want to talk to you!
13464600	13466600	I don't want to talk to you!
13468600	13470600	Are you all right, Sniff?
13472600	13474600	She can't get away, Stinky!
13474600	13476600	The forest is my home ground!
13476600	13478600	You won't catch me in here!
13482600	13484600	I did it!
13484600	13486600	Hold it!
13486600	13488600	Hold it!
13494600	13496600	You can't do this to me!
13496600	13498600	We're only doing what you did to Ninny!
13498600	13500600	Now look, I needed her to help me!
13500600	13502600	I did, I tell ya!
13502600	13504600	But she didn't want to, huh?
13504600	13508600	That's why I put her down this hole to change her mind!
13508600	13510600	And scare her so much that she'd become totally invisible again!
13510600	13512600	She had to be invisible for my plan!
13512600	13514600	Now get me out of here!
13514600	13516600	It's all right, Stinky! See you tomorrow!
13516600	13518600	No!
13522600	13524600	You crushed few thieves!
13524600	13526600	I had such a wonderful plan!
13526600	13528600	Ah!
13528600	13530600	Ah! You're spiteful!
13530600	13532600	Let's hear them my next job!
13532600	13534600	But despite all that had happened,
13534600	13538600	Ninny's face was still not to be seen.
13538600	13540600	Then, about ten days later.
13554600	13558600	This weather seems to push the nails out.
13558600	13562600	I haven't seen anyone stare at the sea like Ninny does.
13562600	13566600	Well, maybe she's never seen it before!
13566600	13568600	Ah!
13568600	13570600	Ah!
13570600	13572600	Ah!
13572600	13574600	Oh, she's crying now!
13588600	13590600	What's the matter?
13590600	13592600	It's the sea!
13592600	13594600	It's far too big!
13594600	13598600	You don't have to go on it, you know.
13598600	13602600	Mama! Mama! What's up?
13602600	13604600	Hmm?
13604600	13606600	What's the matter with her?
13606600	13608600	Nothing to worry about.
13608600	13610600	She's never seen the sea before,
13610600	13614600	and she's just surprised at how big it is.
13616600	13620600	Well, there's an awful lot of water, that's for sure.
13620600	13622600	Ah!
13626600	13628600	Ninny's lucky.
13628600	13630600	I wish there was something to surprise or excite me.
13630600	13632600	Nothing's happened for weeks.
13632600	13634600	Anything would be nice.
13634600	13636600	Mama must be bored.
13636600	13638600	I think you're right.
13638600	13640600	But she never gets bored.
13640600	13642600	Well, she is now. She needs something to happen.
13642600	13644600	I think we should do something to surprise her.
13644600	13646600	Like what?
13646600	13648600	Well, I know what we can do.
13648600	13650600	Tell me.
13650600	13652600	We'll creep up behind her and just give her a little push.
13652600	13654600	What, Papa?
13654600	13656600	Push her into the sea?
13656600	13658600	Oh, Papa, you can't. Mama wouldn't like it.
13658600	13660600	Just watch me.
13660600	13662600	But the water's freezing. A mama will get all wet.
13662600	13664600	We never found the water too cold when we were your age.
13664600	13666600	You young people today have no sense of fun.
13666600	13668600	Did you really used to do things like that?
13668600	13670600	All the time.
13670600	13672600	Papa?
13672600	13674600	Yes, Mumann.
13674600	13676600	Oh, nothing.
13676600	13680600	She's a prank. She'll find it very funny. I promise.
13681600	13682600	Oh!
13703600	13706600	Papa, you're dead!
13706600	13708600	Dow?
13708600	13711600	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
13714600	13717600	Don't you dare push your end to that big horrible scene.
13717600	13718600	Let me explain to you.
13718600	13720600	There's nothing to explain.
13720600	13721600	You're a big bully.
13721600	13723600	She didn't go to a wet.
13723600	13725600	What a nasty trick.
13725600	13728600	You could never, never.
13728600	13730600	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
13730600	13732600	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
13732600	13734600	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
13734600	13736600	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
13736600	13738600	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
13738600	13740600	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
13740600	13742600	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
13742600	13744600	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
13744600	13745600	There's your face!
13745600	13746600	Hurry!
13746600	13747600	Hurry!
13747600	13749600	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
13749600	13752600	That's the last thing to see you.
13752600	13755600	What on earth happened?
13755600	13756600	Were you up to something?
13756600	13757600	Oh, nothing much?
13757600	13760600	You know, that child has got the sharpest teeth
13760600	13762600	with her without her head.
13762600	13765600	Oh, woman, woman, at last I'm visible again.
13765600	13767600	We're always, you won't disappear again.
13767600	13769600	Never, I'll never.
13769600	13770600	Brave girl.
13770600	13773600	And with a good strong set of healthy teeth, too.
13773600	13775600	Oh, I'm so happy, nanny.
13775600	13777600	Me, me, dear.
13779600	13781600	I'm very glad, too.
13781600	13789600	Oh, oh, oh.
13789600	13797600	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
13797600	13803600	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
13803600	13806600	And you?
13806600	13808600	Stop laughing, you horrible child,
13808600	13810600	Child, you use Sirtooth monster.
13815600	13817600	What's so funny, huh?
13817600	13818600	Really?
13837600	13839600	Really? Ninny laughed?
13840600	13843600	Well, she certainly changed, Mum and Mama.
13843600	13846600	All she needed was to get angry, and she did.
13846600	13848600	I hope Mum and Papa's forgiven Ninny.
13848600	13851600	Thank you all for taking such good care of her.
13851600	13855600	I hate to say it, but she sounds almost as bad as it'll mind now.
13856600	13859600	Tiki! Ninny!
13864600	13867600	And so Ninny left Mum and House with Tiki.
13867600	13871600	Now that she was completely visible and far from timid,
13871600	13873600	she was ready for anything.
13873600	13877600	Anything that is except seeing her aunt, she said.
13963600	13977600	The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves!

14083600	14113600	Snort Maiden is running as if the groke is chasing her. I don't think I've ever seen her run so fast. I wonder what's the matter? Perhaps something terrible has happened.
14113600	14143600	Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom

14233600	14258600	A snork? Wait! Wait! Please! Stop! Snork! Don't do it! Why have you brought everybody here, snork maiden?
14258600	14264600	They've come to beg you not to do it! You're too young and brilliant for such a tragic end. Thank the bobble we were in time!
14264600	14271600	As a matter of fact, you weren't. Oh, really? It looks very dangerous to me, snork.
14271600	14276600	Well, it's not a tall woman, Papa. I made these wings myself. They're perfectly balanced.
14276600	14279600	Well, yes, I'm sure they are, but...
14279600	14283600	The blueprints are detailed and precise. They're quite safe.
14283600	14288600	Tell me, snork. Why did you stop on the edge like that after running down the slope?
14288600	14292600	I was measuring the right length for my approach run.
14292600	14295600	Don't do it, snork. I don't want to lose my only brother.
14295600	14297600	Don't make such a fuss, snork maiden.
14297600	14303600	Do you really think it's safe? Of course it is. You don't see birds falling out of the sky, do you?
14303600	14309600	Well, at least. Do your test flight just above the ground so that if something happens to go wrong,
14309600	14314600	I've already done that from the roof of our house and it worked beautifully.
14314600	14317600	Did you see him? No, I didn't see anything.
14317600	14321600	Of course you didn't. Do you think I let a wimpy little sister watch me?
14321600	14323600	What's that supposed to mean, snork?
14323600	14327600	Just that I don't want you sticking your big nose into my affairs all the time.
14327600	14329600	I don't like it and there's nothing to do with you.
14329600	14332600	Yours is just as big and I don't want to lose you.
14332600	14335600	Don't go on about losing me. Why not?
14335600	14337600	Come on now, you two. Stop it.
14337600	14339600	Hey, careful.
14339600	14343600	Oops, that was close. Snork maiden, I don't think your brother is going to be stopped.
14343600	14345600	Oh dear, oh dear.
14345600	14347600	You're very brave, snork.
14349600	14353600	Hmm, right. Here we go.
14353600	14357600	This time it will be a perfect takeoff.
14357600	14361600	It's a long way. Oh look, isn't that snuffkin down there?
14361600	14364600	Where? Where is he? Where's snuffkin?
14364600	14368600	You can't see him from there, Sniff. You'll have to come here.
14368600	14370600	Is it really snuffkin?
14370600	14374600	Yes, I'm sure it is. Snuffkin!
14374600	14376600	Yeah!
14376600	14378600	Baby, here you.
14378600	14380600	No, I don't think so.
14380600	14382600	All right, here goes.
14382600	14384600	Good luck, snork.
14394600	14396600	Here.
14400600	14402600	He's flying!
14402600	14404600	I...
14408600	14410600	Whoa!
14422600	14424600	It's the snork!
14432600	14434600	Hey!
14446600	14448600	Look at him flying.
14448600	14450600	It's all right, snork maiden.
14450600	14452600	Your brother's doing fine. Come and see.
14454600	14456600	He's done it! He's done it!
14456600	14460600	Whoa, I knew he could do it.
14460600	14462600	Well, so did I, to be honest.
14462600	14466600	Huh? Yeah, snork!
14470600	14472600	Hello!
14472600	14474600	Hi! How are you doing?
14474600	14476600	How are you doing?
14476600	14480600	It's great that this test line is a great success.
14490600	14496600	Okay, just as I thought he can't fly in wave at the same time.
14496600	14498600	Interesting.
14498600	14500600	That was mean, stinky.
14500600	14504600	If I could get him to wave with both arms, he'd probably fall.
14504600	14506600	Look, we don't want you here, stinky.
14506600	14508600	Why don't you just go away?
14508600	14512600	I can find lots to do with that machine.
14512600	14514600	If you won't go away, I will.
14514600	14516600	Well, go on then, Snuffkin.
14516600	14518600	What do I care what you do?
14518600	14520600	Hmm, that would be perfect for robberies.
14520600	14524600	The wind seems to be taking him out to sea.
14524600	14526600	Why doesn't he turn around and come back?
14526600	14528600	Turning in that thing might not be so easy.
14528600	14530600	What, do you mean he can't?
14530600	14532600	I'm not sure.
14532600	14534600	I'm not sure.
14534600	14536600	I'm not sure.
14536600	14538600	I'm not sure.
14538600	14540600	Turning in that thing might not be so easy.
14540600	14542600	What, do you mean he can't?
14542600	14544600	Don't worry, Snuffkin made him.
14544600	14546600	Of course he can.
14546600	14550600	What's this I can't turn around?
14550600	14552600	Oh!
14552600	14554600	Oh!
14554600	14556600	Oh!
14556600	14558600	Oh!
14558600	14560600	Oh!
14560600	14562600	Oh, he's hit a tree.
14562600	14564600	Come on, hurry.
14568600	14570600	Oh!
14570600	14572600	Oh!
14572600	14574600	Oh!
14574600	14576600	Oh!
14576600	14578600	Oh!
14578600	14580600	Oh!
14580600	14582600	Oh!
14582600	14584600	Oh!
14584600	14588600	Is he dead?
14588600	14590600	No, he's been knocked out.
14590600	14592600	He looks dead to me anyway.
14592600	14594600	Where are they?
14594600	14596600	What's happened to the wings?
14596600	14598600	Ah!
14598600	14600600	He won't want them anymore.
14600600	14602600	So now I can have them.
14602600	14604600	Now, let me see.
14620600	14624600	So, did the test fly go all right?
14624600	14626600	Tell me what happened.
14626600	14630600	Well, it was fine until the very end.
14630600	14634600	I'm sure that you only need a bit more practice.
14634600	14636600	Flying isn't the easiest thing to master, you know.
14636600	14638600	I expect so.
14638600	14640600	Let's hope you don't run out of bandages, though.
14640600	14642600	Excuse me, snork.
14642600	14644600	Hmm?
14644600	14646600	Are you going to use the wings anymore?
14646600	14648600	I might not.
14648600	14650600	Why?
14650600	14652600	Well, I'll have them if you don't want them.
14652600	14654600	I want to fly in the sky, too.
14654600	14656600	It looks the most exciting thing I've ever seen.
14656600	14658600	Oh, please let me have them.
14658600	14660600	Well, it's not as simple as that, movement.
14660600	14664600	They need testing before the design is complete.
14664600	14666600	But I could do that, snork.
14666600	14668600	I know I could do it.
14668600	14670600	Please let me have them.
14670600	14672600	Well, I suppose I could do with some help.
14672600	14674600	There's a lot to do, fetching and carrying mostly.
14674600	14678600	You haven't said if I can have the wings or not yet, snork.
14678600	14680600	Yes, you can, but on one condition.
14680600	14684600	Well, now the blueprints are finished and the wings are more or less right.
14684600	14686600	I'll need somewhere to build the ship.
14686600	14690600	And somewhere to store all the materials so they'll be dry and at hand.
14690600	14692600	Yes, you will snork.
14692600	14694600	I can see that.
14694600	14696600	It doesn't have to be much.
14696600	14698600	Just a roof will do.
14698600	14700600	Or, and walls.
14700600	14702600	So that people can't spy on me and steal my ideas.
14702600	14704600	I can do the building myself.
14704600	14706600	But I'll need some help.
14706600	14708600	And when it's finished, you can have the wings.
14708600	14710600	I have to help you.
14710600	14714600	I'd have done that anyway, but now that I can have the wings all worked twice as hard.
14714600	14716600	You won't regret it, snork.
14716600	14718600	I promise you you won't.
14718600	14720600	Splendid, woman.
14720600	14722600	That's settled then.
14722600	14724600	Perhaps we can get more help.
14724600	14726600	I'm sure that'd be easy.
14726600	14728600	How about it, Snuffkin?
14728600	14730600	Yes, of course.
14730600	14732600	Will you help us do Sniff?
14732600	14734600	Yes, but I want something too.
14734600	14736600	I'll let you borrow the wings.
14736600	14738600	I only break them.
14738600	14740600	Don't worry, Sniff.
14740600	14742600	I'm sure I'll think of something you can have.
14742600	14744600	Oh, as long as it's something nice.
14744600	14746600	Oh, I do love helping people.
14746600	14748600	You're all hard, Sniff.
14748600	14750600	We know that, for sure.
14754600	14758600	I'm sure you'll need some expert help with the shed, snork.
14766600	14770600	Surely this must be deep enough, Papa?
14770600	14772600	Oh, no.
14772600	14774600	We moments always build for posterity.
14774600	14776600	Besides, I like pouring cement.
14776600	14778600	Okay, Papa.
14778600	14780600	Hey, Papa.
14794600	14798600	I've given your present a lot of fortune, though.
14798600	14802600	And I think I'll give you one of my invaluable books on machinery.
14802600	14804600	Oh?
14804600	14806600	Don't you want it?
14806600	14810600	Well, if there was something else, I'm not much of a reader.
14810600	14814600	What about my invaluable fountain pen?
14814600	14816600	Invaluable fountain pen?
14816600	14818600	What about my invaluable...
14818600	14820600	Do you have anything that's not invaluable, Snork?
14820600	14824600	Well, what about a gold coin?
14824600	14826600	Well, that sounds great.
14826600	14828600	A real gold coin?
14828600	14830600	Oh, boy.
14836600	14838600	Hey.
14850600	14852600	You are digging a very deep hole.
14852600	14856600	Oh, why don't you stop and have some sandwiches?
14856600	14858600	Should we do that, Papa? Go on.
14858600	14860600	Yes, I think we can stop now.
14860600	14862600	Sniff and your brother in the woods.
14862600	14864600	Yes, I know. I hurt them.
14866600	14868600	Hi, Snork Maiden.
14868600	14870600	Oh, no.
14870600	14872600	Wait a minute, I want to ask you something.
14872600	14874600	What is it?
14874600	14876600	Tell me, Snork Maiden.
14876600	14878600	Is it true that your brother gave those wings to a woman?
14878600	14882600	Yes, it is. He's helping Snork to build the shed his payment.
14882600	14884600	I thought they'd been broken up.
14884600	14886600	They hit that tree very hard.
14886600	14888600	Well, my brother's repairing them.
14888600	14890600	Will you let me pass?
14890600	14892600	I've got to take his lunch to him.
14892600	14894600	And will he be able to repair them?
14894600	14896600	He can repair anything.
14896600	14898600	Mmm.
14898600	14900600	Gosh, what a lot of wood you've got.
14900600	14904600	Well, the shed has to be a lot bigger than my flying ship.
14904600	14906600	Moomin' and Moomin' Papa are digging holes.
14906600	14908600	They sure are deep.
14908600	14910600	Oh, boy.
14910600	14912600	Oh, boy.
14912600	14914600	It'll be a lot bigger than my flying ship.
14914600	14918600	Moomin' and Moomin' Papa are digging holes. They sure are deep.
14918600	14922600	Everybody's being very kind, very kind indeed.
14924600	14928600	Mama's cooking and Snuffkin's gone to get nails.
14928600	14932600	There are some other things I need him to get as well.
14932600	14934600	Will you write them down?
14934600	14936600	Of course, I will, Snork.
14936600	14938600	Oh, you're such a planner.
14938600	14940600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14940600	14942600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14942600	14944600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14944600	14946600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14946600	14948600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14948600	14950600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14950600	14952600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14952600	14954600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14954600	14956600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14956600	14958600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14958600	14960600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14960600	14962600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14962600	14964600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14964600	14966600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14966600	14968600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14968600	14970600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14970600	14972600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14972600	14974600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14974600	14976600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14976600	14978600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14978600	14980600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14980600	14982600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14982600	14984600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14984600	14986600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14986600	14988600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14988600	14990600	Oh, I'm afraid.
14996600	14998600	Hey, what's up?
14998600	15000600	The...
15000600	15002600	The...
15002600	15004600	The...
15004600	15006600	The...
15006600	15008600	Your...
15008600	15010600	Moment here.
15010600	15012700	Come in, moving.
15012700	15014600	Thank you for all your help.
15014600	15018600	You did so much that these wings are hardly paymented enough.
15018600	15020600	But if you're happy with them.
15020600	15022600	Oh, no, it was great fun building the shed.
15022600	15024600	I changed the design a bit,
15024600	15026100	so it's easier to take off and land.
15026100	15028540	We have a problem anymore.
15028540	15032340	You must remember to give yourself plenty of time though, woman.
15032340	15033340	Thank you, Snork.
15033340	15035060	I can't wait to try them out.
15035060	15036060	I'm so excited.
15036060	15037060	I don't think I'll sleep tonight.
15037060	15039060	Are you trying them out tomorrow?
15039060	15040580	As soon as I can.
15040580	15042700	You will be careful.
15042700	15046860	You must practice a lot just above the ground to get used to wearing them before you try
15046860	15048180	to go too high.
15048180	15050460	I don't want anything to happen to you.
15050460	15058380	I'll practice, I promise.
15058380	15060140	Where are you going to practice tomorrow?
15060140	15061780	I haven't decided.
15061780	15069580	I'll find somewhere when I come out tomorrow, perhaps on that small hill near the cliff.
15069580	15071700	But that can't be too dangerous.
15071700	15073700	I'll see you there.
15074700	15076700	Hey!
15079700	15080700	Hey!
15080700	15082700	Hey!
15082700	15084700	Hey!
15084700	15085700	Hey!
15104700	15106700	Hey!
15121700	15122700	Hi, Momen.
15122700	15124700	Where do you put the wings?
15126700	15128700	On the table outside.
15128700	15132700	You must have gone past them if you came in through the veranda door.
15132700	15134700	No, I didn't.
15134700	15135700	They're not there.
15135700	15136700	What?
15141700	15143700	Oh no, you're right.
15143700	15145700	They're gone.
15145700	15147700	Oh dear, I thought it was my wish.
15147700	15149700	What's happened to them?
15149700	15150700	Somebody stolen them.
15150700	15152700	What's the matter with you, too?
15152700	15153700	Is something wrong?
15153700	15156700	Yes, somebody stolen Momen's wings.
15156700	15159700	Well, perhaps they have them in stolen.
15160700	15164700	Of course they have, and I bet I know who did it, too.
15164700	15165700	Come on.
15165700	15166700	Where are we going?
15166700	15168700	Do you know where they are?
15176700	15177700	It's stinky.
15177700	15178700	Oh, yeah.
15178700	15180700	Well, it certainly didn't take you long.
15180700	15182700	Just a minute, stinky.
15182700	15184700	Those are my wings.
15184700	15186700	See, I knew it was him.
15189700	15191700	You are the creature.
15191700	15193700	I certainly will back.
15193700	15196700	If you give them back, stinky, I'll let you try them out later.
15196700	15197700	I promise.
15197700	15198700	No way, boom.
15198700	15202700	When they're mine now, I'm going to be a high flier.
15202700	15204700	Look out, moving.
15207700	15208700	Oh, stop!
15208700	15210700	Oh no!
15211700	15213700	You're pathetic.
15213700	15215700	The wings are mine.
15215700	15218700	I'll become a master criminal now.
15220700	15222700	All rotten seabing.
15222700	15225700	You shouldn't have left them outside, Momen.
15225700	15228700	Yeah, but who'd think let each steal them?
15228700	15229700	Where his friends?
15229700	15230700	Well, almost.
15230700	15233700	I didn't think even stinky would do something like that.
15233700	15234700	Well, he did, didn't he?
15234700	15236700	Now, don't worry, Momen.
15236700	15238700	We'll find him and get them back.
15238700	15239700	I know it.
15245700	15246700	Look, Momen.
15246700	15248700	Now he's going towards the sea.
15250700	15253700	Oh no, turn around.
15253700	15255700	But stinky didn't know how to maneuver the wings.
15255700	15258700	It must take him further and further out.
15261700	15263700	Turn around, we'll get turned back.
15264700	15265700	Until?
15273700	15275700	You're at least he's having a bath for once.
15275700	15277700	The wings will be badly damaged.
15278700	15279700	Never mind.
15279700	15281700	Snark will build another pair.
15281700	15283700	I sure hope so.
15308700	15313700	They love the laughter and they love the living.
15313700	15316700	The movements.
15316700	15324700	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
15324700	15328700	They're always happy and always at play.
15328700	15332700	The movements are having fun day after day.
15332700	15335700	The movements.
15336700	15340700	The movements.
15340700	15343700	They love the laughter and they love the living.
15343700	15347700	The movements.
15347700	15354700	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
15354700	15358700	They're always happy and always at play.
15358700	15362700	The movements are having fun day after day.
15362700	15365700	The movements.
15365700	15369700	The movements.
15369700	15375700	The movements.
15393700	15397700	Here they are for one and all.
15397700	15400700	The movements are about to come.
15400700	15403700	Come on and sit down here with me.
15403700	15405700	Therefore you are your TV.
15405700	15408700	They are the movements.
15408700	15411700	They are the movements.
15411700	15414700	So come with me, give me your hand.
15414700	15417700	I'll take you up to a movement land.
15417700	15420700	You can fly just like a bird.
15421700	15423700	Sing that song ever.
15423700	15426700	There were the movements.
15426700	15429700	There were the movements.
15429700	15432700	There were the movements.
15432700	15435700	There were the movements.
15435700	15438700	There were the movements.
15438700	15441700	There were the movements.
15450700	15453700	There were the movements.
15453700	15456700	There were the movements.
15456700	15459700	There were the movements.
15459700	15462700	There were the movements.
15462700	15465700	There were the movements.
15465700	15468700	There were the movements.
15468700	15471700	There were the movements.
15471700	15475700	There were the movements.
15476700	15486700	Captain Blood and his band of feared pirates had sailed the seas for many years,
15486700	15489700	but never could he remember a storm such as this.
15489700	15495700	He began to wonder whether his ship could withstand the battering and buffeting of the angry waves for much longer.
15495700	15501700	Alas, it is now too late to launch the lifeboat, he thought, as he lashed himself to the wheel.
15501700	15504700	His voice rose against the wind.
15504700	15511700	Captain Blood can think of no better death than to journey to the bottom of the sea, losing the last battle against his old adversary.
15511700	15518700	But if only I could see the life of the young and beautiful princess who I rescued from the dupe scallion before a ciker.
15518700	15525700	I care not about the three chests of doubloons, two chests of jewels, and 36 bales of the richest and most colorful silks.
15525700	15530700	But oh, must she too perish in this terrible storm.
15531700	15537700	What a terrible storm, it's not easing at all.
15537700	15538700	No.
15538700	15541700	I'm so glad I'm not on my own in a night like this.
15541700	15544700	I feel safe in the moment house.
15544700	15546700	Oh, what was that?
15546700	15549700	It sounded like a tree breaking.
15549700	15550700	Hey, moment.
15550700	15553700	Why don't you read your story out loud?
15553700	15554700	Oh, okay.
15554700	15556700	But can I start where I got to?
15556700	15560700	As long as you tell us what's happened before, we won't know what it's about.
15560700	15562700	And we might have missed something important.
15562700	15564700	Just the main points we'll do, women.
15564700	15566700	Well, there's this brave pirate.
15566700	15568700	Oh, it's so much fun when someone reads out loud.
15568700	15570700	Go on, moment.
15570700	15571700	Captain Blood.
15571700	15575700	And he and his men have captured a rich and royal gallery.
15575700	15579700	They've taken lots of gold, silver, and jewels and things.
15579700	15581700	And oh, yes, a princess too.
15581700	15583700	It's exciting, isn't it?
15583700	15584700	Yes, it is.
15586700	15591700	The storm that rose that night was so violent that at first,
15591700	15596700	it seemed inevitable the ship found before the waves had engulfed it.
15596700	15599700	Not bad, if I say so myself.
15599700	15604700	Captain Blood saw that the poor princess had indeed swooned.
15604700	15609700	With only the rats for company, how frightened she must have been down in the old.
15609700	15615700	The noise of the storm was deafening as the ship was thrown above under swirling sea.
15616700	15619700	The captain's brave heart went out to his young and beautiful captain.
15619700	15620700	Could I have some tea, Mama?
15620700	15621700	Of course, dear.
15621700	15623700	Would you like me to bring it up to you?
15623700	15625700	No thanks. I finished for the day.
15625700	15628700	That's good. Shall we all have some tea and lemonade?
15628700	15630700	Yes, please. I'm very thirsty.
15630700	15633700	You read very well. Thank you, women.
15633700	15635700	Great story, isn't it?
15635700	15637700	Could I have some strawberry juice, please, Mama?
15637700	15640700	It's not, Maiden. When is your brother coming home?
15640700	15641700	Oh, he didn't say exactly.
15641700	15644700	But in a couple of days, I should think...
15644700	15649700	It was a good idea to let snort Maiden stay while he was away, wasn't it, Papa?
15649700	15654700	Yes, it wouldn't be very nice to be all on your own at night in a storm like this.
15654700	15656700	Hmm, not at all.
15671700	15673700	She seems to be sinking.
15673700	15675700	She won't be able to hold out much longer.
15675700	15678700	We must get to the crew without delay.
15678700	15680700	How could we launch a boat in this weather?
15680700	15682700	Any survivors?
15682700	15685700	We haven't found anyone yet.
15685700	15688700	So what about further along the coast?
15688700	15690700	Any reports of survivors turning up?
15690700	15693700	No, I'm afraid not, Inspector. We haven't heard anything.
15693700	15695700	Well, tell me if you do.
15695700	15697700	Ah, Inspector.
15697700	15698700	Yes?
15698700	15700700	It seems to me it was a pirate ship that sunk.
15700700	15702700	What did you say?
15704700	15708700	Well, I'm pretty sure I saw the skull and crossbones flying from the mast.
15708700	15711700	And I think I caught sight of a cannon, but I could have been mistaken.
15711700	15713700	You must be joking.
15713700	15714700	I never joke.
15714700	15720700	I can't see anything. It's too far away to make out any sort of skull and crossbones.
15720700	15721700	Try this.
15721700	15726700	Ah, you've got a telescope. Now why didn't you let me have this before? It might have helped.
15734700	15735700	Oh!
15742700	15744700	Ah, that's it. She's gone.
15750700	15753700	I suppose that there aren't many pirate ships around today.
15753700	15758700	Any that are afloat must be so old that they'd probably break up easily.
15758700	15762700	That's if it was a pirate ship, but it sure looked like one right enough.
15763700	15765700	Nothing's been washed up on the shore yet.
15765700	15767700	No, not a thing.
15770700	15774700	Isn't it strange that I was reading that book about pirates yesterday?
15774700	15777700	They probably wouldn't be quite so romantic in real life.
15777700	15781700	Well, in the book they were really great. I wish I'd been one.
15781700	15782700	A pirate?
15782700	15784700	Yeah, what could be more exciting?
15784700	15786700	You can't mean that.
15786700	15792700	Oh, yes, I do. To sail across the seven seas, the holds of your ship's crowned with treasures.
15792700	15796700	But you'd have to steal the treasure from somebody first, so, Moomin.
15796700	15802700	Well, yes, alright. I suppose so. But I wouldn't steal anything from anyone.
15802700	15806700	Ah, then you're just a sailor. Not a pirate at all.
15806700	15813700	Moomin, Mama, do you know where Moomin is?
15813700	15816700	He's probably in Stuffkin's tent.
15816700	15817700	Oh, yeah?
15817700	15820700	Snork maiden, I have a letter for you.
15820700	15823700	Yeah, you are. It's from the snork.
15823700	15828700	Oh, thank you. Wait a minute, little Mai. I want to read Snork's letter.
15828700	15830700	Take your time.
15837700	15840700	Oh, what's the matter?
15840700	15842700	It's Snork. He's coming home today.
15842700	15844700	Well, that's nice.
15844700	15847700	But Moomin, Mama, there's no food in the house at all.
15847700	15850700	Now, don't worry about that, Snork maiden.
15850700	15854700	I'll whistle up some dinner for us, and Snork can tell us all about his trip.
15854700	15855700	Boom and Papa like that.
15855700	15859700	Oh, thank you, Mama. Snork doesn't like missing his meals.
15859700	15862700	He must have got the part sooner than he thought.
15862700	15864700	Ha, that's great news.
15864700	15866700	He should finish his flying ship soon, hey?
15866700	15868700	I guess so.
15868700	15871700	He should make it into a pirate flying ship.
15871700	15875700	I could be his first maid, and no one would be able to catch us.
15875700	15877700	Nobody at all!
15879700	15881700	Not here.
15881700	15884700	Oh, dear. I wonder where they've gone, little Mai.
15884700	15887700	There's nobody here.
15887700	15890700	Moomin probably wanted to go looking for an adventure.
15890700	15894700	I bet they went down to the beach to see if anything's been washed out.
15894700	15896700	At least the hangar's not been damaged.
15896700	15899700	Let's go down to the beach. We may find a treasure chest.
15899700	15902700	Huh?
15905700	15907700	What is it?
15907700	15909700	I just thought I heard something.
15909700	15911700	Where? From in there.
15911700	15913700	Hmm, weird.
15913700	15916700	Oh, I know. The snork must have come back.
15916700	15919700	Oh, yes. Snork. Of course.
15920700	15923700	Hello, snork.
15923700	15926700	Oh, snork? Are you in here?
15926700	15928700	Mm-hmm.
15928700	15930700	Ah!
15932700	15934700	Snork me.
15934700	15936700	Huh?
15936700	15938700	Huh?
15941700	15944700	Put her down.
15945700	15948700	Oh, really? It was actually a pirate ship.
15948700	15953700	It was indeed Moomin Papa, and we caught the pirates when they swam ashore.
15953700	15956700	Do you think you captured all of them, Inspector?
15956700	15960700	Well, of course, we don't know exactly how many there were to begin with.
15960700	15966700	Hmm, right. I better barricade ourselves in Moomin House just to be on the safe side.
15966700	15972700	Oh, dear. And I suppose I ought to stand guard over my greenhouse as well.
15973700	15978700	Blast me, baby. So, come here, you little pineapple.
15978700	15982700	Do let snork me go. You'll be sorry. You great big hairy folly.
15982700	15987700	No, not in your life, though. It's just my hostage. I needed to make good my escape, but go.
15987700	15990700	Then you only have yourself to blame.
15990700	15995700	Hey, what? Blame? Stay where you are now. I will not be bitten again.
15995700	15997700	Keep away a little cat.
15997700	15999700	Well, don't hurt her then.
15999700	16003700	Don't hurt her, you little shark. She's a hostage. Come me one at that.
16003700	16006700	She'll be my safe passenger. These rough waters are perished.
16006700	16010700	Well, then you better take me instead, because I'm much easier to carry.
16010700	16014700	You, huh? Then nobody would care if I fed you slowly to the shrimps.
16014700	16017700	Oh, yes, lots of people. When you overstab win, baby.
16017700	16022700	All right, all right. Hold your head. We'd blow me down. No, what's your name, girl?
16022700	16024700	I'm Lil Mai.
16024700	16028700	Well, I'm Captain Rumpod. Not going to get whatever authorities you have in this backwater.
16028700	16031700	Hurry, my patience is short.
16031700	16035700	I'll only go if you promise that you won't hurt Snork Maiden.
16035700	16037700	Of course I won't.
16037700	16041700	If I find that you've heard her in any way at all, my revenge will be terrible.
16041700	16044700	All right, all right, all right.
16044700	16046700	Oh, boy.
16046700	16073700	Captain Rumpod, you are surrounded.
16073700	16076700	Let Snork Maiden go. Do you hear me, Captain?
16076700	16080700	Do a gold button land lover like you never.
16080700	16084700	She's a good-looking wench fair skinned and nicely rounded.
16084700	16088700	Pirates prefer blondes. Give me a ship and you can have her back.
16088700	16091700	What do you say to let my buck-hole?
16091700	16096700	You're on your own, Captain. We've got all your men locked up tight.
16096700	16098700	All me crew?
16098700	16102700	You're the last one. Now let her go immediately.
16102700	16106700	Thank you for saving me crew. I feared they were all lost.
16106700	16109700	Don't thank me. They're all in jail.
16109700	16112700	Ah, someone said it's the best place for them.
16112700	16116700	But not me. Now let them out. I need them and a proper ship.
16116700	16119700	Oh, with two masks and fifty cannon.
16119700	16123700	No tricks. Else it'll be worse for the girl.
16123700	16126700	This is too much.
16126700	16129700	The school for constables didn't tell us about theirs.
16129700	16131700	What should we do, Inspector?
16132700	16135700	Please get Snorke making away from him.
16135700	16138700	I'm afraid he'll hurt her and she'll be frightened.
16138700	16141700	I'm trying my best, but it's very awkward all this.
16141700	16144700	I've not come across anything like it before.
16144700	16147700	Oh, but it's not her fault that his ship sank, Inspector.
16147700	16150700	I know, I know. Oh, dear, oh dear.
16150700	16153700	Oh, I should have been a gardener.
16153700	16156700	Hey, are you still there, you ruffian?
16156700	16161700	Let my men go and get my ship. Two masks and fifty cannon mine.
16161700	16165700	Look, Captain Rumpod, I'm afraid that times have changed.
16165700	16168700	Sailing ships don't have cannon these days.
16168700	16171700	Shiver me timbers. How do you sink each other then?
16171700	16174700	I don't try to fool me. Remember, I've got the girl.
16174700	16178700	I think Moomin Papa has an old blender bus. I'm sure he'll let you have.
16178700	16181700	I don't know if it'll work, though. That's all I've got.
16181700	16185700	I'm one of you, pea brain. This is my final word. So listen well.
16185700	16188700	You have two hours to get the ship ready to sail,
16188700	16192700	and all my crew with her mine. Or else I'll...
16192700	16195700	Now, don't worry, my pretty one. I won't have a single hair on your head,
16195700	16198700	but I must have something to threaten them with.
16198700	16202700	Or else I'll feed her to the hungry shark.
16203700	16206700	Husker, I won't hurt you.
16206700	16207700	Are you sure?
16207700	16211700	Either I get my ship. Oak, fifty cannon, and at least two masters.
16211700	16213700	Master shall be food for lobsters.
16213700	16215700	it's your choice me has he
16215700	16218700	that you do it.
16218700	16222700	he sounds as if you'll do it too.
16222700	16226700	two hours he says a real feeder to the sharks, oh dear, dear.
16226700	16230700	what will snorks say, oh dear, dear.
16230700	16234700	I have a great idea, sir.
16234700	16237700	Why don't we climb on to the roof, drill a hole,
16237700	16239700	and then drops up on his hand.
16239700	16242700	No, Constable, I've always thought you were an idiot,
16242700	16243700	now you've proved it.
16243700	16245700	Excuse me, Inspector.
16245700	16249700	If we set fire to the hangar, then they'll have to come out.
16249700	16253700	Shut up! Why am I surrounded by fools?
16253700	16255700	This is no good.
16255700	16259700	I must calm down. I must calm down.
16259700	16261700	Captain Rumbot!
16261700	16263700	Can you hear me, Captain?
16263700	16266700	Aha, you found a ship already, have you?
16266700	16270700	Well, no, there aren't any real sailing ships in Moomin Valley.
16270700	16272700	The chief Constable has a yacht.
16272700	16276700	He doesn't usually let anyone borrow it, but I'm sure in this case he...
16276700	16279700	I want something big enough to take me to the Spanish main!
16279700	16280700	I warned you!
16280700	16282700	Calm down, Captain. Calm down.
16282700	16284700	Now just listen to me.
16284700	16286700	You haven't done anything wrong here.
16286700	16288700	No pirating or such like.
16288700	16291700	So if you forget about the boat, we'll let you all go.
16291700	16292700	Think about it.
16292700	16295700	Three to go anywhere you like. On foot, of course.
16295700	16299700	The fresh air, the sun on your face. No worry of shipwrecks.
16299700	16301700	No storms at sea.
16301700	16303700	What do you think we are?
16303700	16305700	We're pirates, not highwaymen.
16305700	16308700	It's not so bad being a highwayman, you know.
16308700	16311700	There'll be lots of rich travelers on the other side of Lonely Mountain.
16311700	16314700	I'm sure. And lots of adventures with jewels and gold.
16314700	16318700	Day me with flagens are rubbing a chicken brain, nitwit!
16318700	16319700	Nitwit?
16319700	16321700	No, niggum poop! Dumbbell!
16321700	16323700	I'm Captain Rumbot!
16323700	16325700	You're making me very angry!
16325700	16327700	If I had you on my ship, you'd dangle from the yard!
16327700	16329700	I'm yet to walk the flag!
16329700	16331700	The inspector's losing control.
16331700	16333700	We had better calm him down.
16334700	16336700	What the clank would I?
16336700	16339700	And in my prison, you'd get no butter on their bread.
16339700	16341700	And maggots on your biscuits!
16341700	16343700	Please calm down.
16343700	16345700	Is this what the pilot said?
16345700	16347700	Calm down. Take the museum.
16347700	16349700	Sure. We water.
16349700	16351700	I'd see too that the bread was milled.
16353700	16355700	That's 30 minutes gone already!
16368700	16370700	I warned you, gold button.
16370700	16374700	Now there is only one hour to her painful and horrible death!
16375700	16377700	Oh!
16379700	16381700	Cheer up, Snark Maiden!
16381700	16384700	Try and hold on! We'll get you out!
16384700	16386700	Water? Water?
16386700	16388700	Huh? What did you say?
16388700	16391700	Water, please. I'm so thirsty.
16391700	16392700	Water?
16392700	16395700	Mastik's stuff, still.
16395700	16397700	Hey, land lovers!
16397700	16398700	Compliments to the galley!
16398700	16400700	The young lady wants a drink!
16400700	16403700	All right, Captain. I'm coming, Snark Maiden!
16404700	16406700	I'll take it, Inspector.
16406700	16409700	It's too dangerous. You must leave it to us now, Momen.
16409700	16411700	Just a minute, Inspector.
16411700	16413700	I think we should let Momen go.
16413700	16415700	And I've got an idea that just might work.
16415700	16417700	Snark Maiden!
16417700	16419700	It'll take an awful lot of courage.
16419700	16421700	And you'll have to do it all on your own.
16421700	16422700	Do you think you can do it, Momen?
16422700	16424700	Of course.
16428700	16431700	Splice me, babe. Raise what's taken him so long.
16431700	16433700	Keep an eye on the lady. Wait.
16433700	16436700	It's all right. I really don't mind waiting.
16436700	16439700	Tell you the truth. I can do it and drink myself.
16439700	16442700	It's thirsty work. Shouting at idiot policeman.
16442700	16445700	Don't you worry, little one. They'll be here soon.
16445700	16449700	Get me a drink, too. You're here and quick about it!
16449700	16453700	I've brought you something to drink, Captain.
16453700	16457700	All right. Come on, then. And no funny stuff.
16457700	16460700	Don't worry. I'm on my own.
16460700	16462700	Have you done a drink for me, too?
16462700	16463700	Yes, Captain.
16463700	16466700	All right. Stay there and put down the tree.
16468700	16470700	The bigger one is for you, Captain.
16470700	16472700	And the little one for Snark Maiden.
16472700	16474700	Now move away.
16475700	16477700	That's far enough. Stay there.
16481700	16483700	Hmm. Why is it so red?
16484700	16488700	Well, it's strawberry juice. It's very good.
16492700	16496700	I'll be polite. She can drink from this one and I'll have hers.
16496700	16500700	But, Captain, there's not enough for you in the small one.
16500700	16503700	Strawberry juice isn't exactly my favorite tip of you.
16503700	16505700	Oh, no. The small one will do.
16506700	16508700	Here you are, young lady.
16509700	16512700	No, no, Snark Maiden. Please, don't drink it.
16513700	16516700	Why not, my young Bucco? It's not poison, is it?
16516700	16519700	Don't be silly. Poisoned? Oh, no, no.
16519700	16521700	Perhaps a sleeping potion.
16523700	16528700	Hmm. As I thought, I deemed mighty strange the two cups were prepared.
16528700	16530700	You drink it.
16530700	16533700	Oh, no, no, no, sir. I'm not thirsty at all.
16533700	16537700	What's the matter, Milad? You said the drink wasn't poisoned, didn't you?
16537700	16539700	So drink.
16539700	16540700	Movement?
16540700	16542700	Ah, you're her swing, are you?
16542700	16545700	I shall never understand women anyway.
16545700	16548700	One of you will have to drink it and now.
16549700	16552700	Not her. I'll do it. I'll do it. Give it to me.
16552700	16556700	No, Movement, don't. There's something in it. You'll be poisoned.
16556700	16561700	It's all right, Snark Maiden. It's nothing dangerous. Don't worry about me.
16561700	16563700	I'm drinking.
16566700	16569700	That's it. Drink up again.
16572700	16574700	Down the hatch, Milad.
16575700	16579700	You're lucky and wasn't poisoned.
16579700	16581700	Yeah.
16581700	16584700	And no sleeping potion, neither?
16584700	16588700	No, nothing at all. Nothing at all.
16591700	16593700	Oh, Movement! Oh, no, Movement!
16593700	16595700	You're not my pretty one.
16595700	16600700	Your wimpy little bow is just taking a nap. You'll be right as rain so...
16601700	16607700	And he thought he could fool me. Me, Captain Rumpot.
16607700	16611700	But she can. Well, I'll have the other one.
16614700	16616700	Not bad.
16616700	16618700	No, I'm sorry, young lady.
16618700	16620700	They'll have to bring you another.
16620700	16623700	Shall we order one without the draft?
16623700	16627700	They'll be surprised when they see me still on my pins.
16627700	16630700	Why do I not sleep at all?
16632700	16634700	Let's go and give my surprise.
16647700	16649700	A moment!
16649700	16652700	It's all right. I'm okay, Snark Maiden.
16652700	16655700	There's nothing in this drink. Would you like some?
16655700	16657700	A moment! You mean you!
16657700	16660700	Why was pretending? So I convinced you, too, huh?
16660700	16662700	A moment!
16668700	16671700	Captain Rumpot didn't wake up that day.
16671700	16676700	Or the next. And when he did, he had a terrible headache which served him right.
16676700	16686700	The inspector let all the pirates go after a week.
16686700	16691700	Well, they hadn't done any pirating in Moomin Valley. And wouldn't be doing any either.
16691700	16694700	Not without a ship.
16695700	16697700	A moment!
16703700	16709700	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
16709700	16717700	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
16718700	16722700	They're always happy and always at play.
16722700	16729700	The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.
16729700	16733700	The movements.
16733700	16740700	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
16740700	16746700	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
16747700	16751700	They're always happy and always at play.
16751700	16758700	The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.
16758700	16762700	The movements.
16762700	16768700	The movements.
16777700	16787700	The movements.
16787700	16793700	Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come.
16793700	16798700	Come on and sit down here with me. They're here for you on your TV.
16798700	16804700	They are the movements. They are the movements.
16804700	16810700	So come with me, give me your hand. I'll take you up to Moomin Land.
16810700	16818700	You can fly just like a bird. Sing that song ever. There were the movements.
16818700	16824700	There were the movements. There were the movements.
16824700	16830700	There were the movements. There were the movements.
16830700	16834700	There were the movements.
16860700	16886700	The rain was falling on Moomin Valley as though the heavens had decided to empty themselves.
16886700	16893700	It was the wettest weather that anyone could remember.
16917700	16923700	The rain was falling on Moomin Valley as though the heavens had decided to empty themselves.
16923700	16931700	The rain was falling on Moomin Valley as though the heavens had decided to empty themselves.
16931700	16940700	Mama, can I borrow this? Of course, dear.
16941700	16945700	You'll miss one too? Yes, dear, but what do you need them for?
16945700	16948700	It's a secret. A secret? Yeah, sure.
16948700	16953700	I'll want to see a back moment, but you can keep the jar if you like. Thanks.
16971700	16977700	Oh, dear. Oh, there are puddles everywhere. Oh, dear.
16977700	16983700	Oh, dear. Mr. Hemmilan, what a mess. Hello, Mr. Hemmilan.
16983700	16992700	Oh, good morning, Moomin. Oh, it's all misty now. What are you doing, Moomin?
16992700	16999700	Observing very closely. Oh, splendid, my boy. I'm glad you find botany so excited.
16999700	17001700	Hi, dear.
