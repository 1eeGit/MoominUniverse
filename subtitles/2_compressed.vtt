00:00.000 --> 00:02.500
Oh, what exactly is it you're observing?

00:02.500 --> 00:05.500
I'm sure I saw a beautiful crayfish in there.

00:05.500 --> 00:09.500
Crayfish? Excuse me, young man, but that is zoology.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.500
Quite the most uninteresting field.

00:12.500 --> 00:14.500
There it is.

00:42.500 --> 00:49.500
Oh! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:13.500 --> 01:19.500
I got him! I got him!

01:19.500 --> 01:24.500
I got him!

01:36.500 --> 01:38.500
A dragon?

01:43.500 --> 01:47.500
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.500
Papa!

01:52.500 --> 01:54.500
Oh, what have you got there?

01:54.500 --> 01:55.500
Oh, oh, nothing, Papa!

01:55.500 --> 01:58.500
Everything's so fresh after the rain, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.500
Yes it is.

02:03.500 --> 02:07.500
I gotta show this to Snuffkin before anybody else sees it.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.500
Mm-hmm.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.500
Oh!

02:25.500 --> 02:26.500
Mm-hmm.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.500
Boom, moment!

02:28.500 --> 02:30.500
What have you got there, Moomin?

02:30.500 --> 02:32.500
Oh, oh, nothing! Nothing at all, little lion.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.500
Oh, yes, you have, I saw it! Don't lie to me!

02:35.500 --> 02:38.500
It's just one of Mama's old jars.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.500
Liar, liar, I know there's something.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.500
I don't think there's nothing.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.500
Then why are you hiding it?

02:47.500 --> 02:50.500
Oh, why did a little lion see me, it's not fair.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.500
Dragon?

03:00.500 --> 03:02.500
Ah, yeah, I was right.

03:03.500 --> 03:08.500
It must be a baby dragon, probably the very last one on earth and washed up by the rain.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.500
A dragon of my own.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.500
That's wonderful.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.500
Oh, I hope I didn't frighten you.

03:20.500 --> 03:25.500
I know what I'll do, I'll take the lid off the jar so you can get some fresh air, little dragon.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.500
See, that's better, isn't it?

03:32.500 --> 03:35.500
Come on little fella, we'll give you a car to make you feel better.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.500
Oh, that burnt me!

03:43.500 --> 03:45.500
What a piercing dragon you are!

03:45.500 --> 03:47.500
Don't worry, I'll look after you.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.500
I'll take good care of you.

03:49.500 --> 03:53.500
And when you're bigger and start to like me, I'll take you swimming in the sea.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.500
Oh, I'm sorry, you must be starving.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.500
I'll get you something from my nighttime emergency food box.

04:02.500 --> 04:06.500
I've got lots of things in there, bound to be something you like.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.500
The one, take anything you want.

04:39.500 --> 04:44.500
Gosh, that's really clever little dragon.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.500
Moving, lunch is ready.

04:48.500 --> 04:49.500
Coming!

04:50.500 --> 04:51.500
Now you stay here.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.500
Don't worry, I'll be back in no time at all.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.500
Remember, you're my own little dragon.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.500
Oh!

05:05.500 --> 05:08.500
Where's Sniff? I thought he was here as well.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.500
He's collecting worms for fishing.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.500
He'll be here soon.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.500
We'll start without him then.

05:13.500 --> 05:17.500
You know, Mama, certain people keep secrets in glass jars.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.500
Secrets?

05:20.500 --> 05:24.500
Oh, yes, a little secret that hisses.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.500
Moment, Mama, I found this near the big puddle.

05:30.500 --> 05:31.500
Thank you, Sniff.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.500
Moment, I told you I wanted it back.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.500
It's my very best one.

05:36.500 --> 05:40.500
Sorry, Mama, I was so excited I must have left it when I found...

05:40.500 --> 05:41.500
I mean, when I was...

05:41.500 --> 05:44.500
And I'm sure you know who I mean by certain people.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.500
Did you catch anything with the sieve, Moment?

05:47.500 --> 05:51.500
Yes, he did. Something that's now hidden in his room.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.500
Big mouth.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.500
If it's a secret little my, perhaps he doesn't want to tell anyone.

05:56.500 --> 05:59.500
Yeah, probably because his new pet bites.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.500
Well, it hasn't bitten you yet, hasn't it?

06:01.500 --> 06:03.500
Huh, if it did, I'd bite it back.

06:03.500 --> 06:07.500
Is it true? Does your secret really bite people?

06:07.500 --> 06:11.500
Well, it couldn't bite very hard if it was small enough to go in a jar, could it, Papa?

06:11.500 --> 06:15.500
I suppose certain people might keep other small things in jars,

06:15.500 --> 06:20.500
beetles and spiders, mosquitoes, scorpions, or poisonous centipedes, horrible things.

06:20.500 --> 06:25.500
That multiply and multiply every week and grow and grow until the jars are too small.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.500
See? Like that.

06:29.500 --> 06:34.500
And there'll be so many of them, thousands and thousands, and they'll take over Moon Valley and eat us all.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.500
Oh, well, I haven't got a centipede.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.500
Hmm, I wonder if centipedes come from outer space.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.500
But this is the Earth's deer.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.500
The rain could have brought them down from space, Mama, couldn't it?

06:45.500 --> 06:49.500
Well, you could be right. It was raining very hard yesterday.

06:49.500 --> 06:52.500
And it wasn't like ordinary rain.

06:52.500 --> 06:55.500
I saw a puddle as big as a lake.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.500
What's the matter, Moon?

06:58.500 --> 07:00.500
It isn't a centipede.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.500
Ha, we're on the right track, though.

07:05.500 --> 07:09.500
Well, I'm glad it's not a poisonous centipede. I shouldn't have liked that.

07:10.500 --> 07:14.500
Oh, you're asleep. Moonman's little dragon.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.500
Is it okay if I go see snuffkin, Mama?

07:20.500 --> 07:22.500
Have you finished already?

07:22.500 --> 07:28.500
Yes, I have. Tell them they mustn't go into my room. Or they'll have to take the consequence.

07:28.500 --> 07:32.500
All right, Moonman. I'll make sure no one thinks.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
I promise.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.500
Oh, but he's going to tell snuffkin this secret.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.500
I should think he is.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.500
Best friends always come first, little my.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.500
Hey, snuffkin!

08:08.500 --> 08:09.500
Hi!

08:09.500 --> 08:11.500
Fishing again?

08:11.500 --> 08:16.500
Yep. The cards told me that if I caught five minutes, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.500
South?

08:18.500 --> 08:20.500
You're joking!

08:20.500 --> 08:22.500
Not at all. I believe in the cards.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.500
But snuffkin, winter's not here yet.

08:25.500 --> 08:29.500
I know that. But the cards tell you things for a reason, Moonman.

08:29.500 --> 08:34.500
Oh, do they really? But it would be awfully few anyway, snuffkin. Just awful.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.500
I mean, I'd be very lonely.

08:36.500 --> 08:40.500
Well, anyway, who would I talk to or tell my secrets to?

08:42.500 --> 08:46.500
Oh, snuffkin, quickly! You always come up to Moonman House.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.500
Now?

08:47.500 --> 08:48.500
Yeah.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.500
Well, I suppose I could fish later.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.500
No, no, there's no point.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.500
But I have to catch five minutes.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.500
Oh!

08:55.500 --> 09:01.500
The fish won't bite after all his rain. You'd catch nothing. It'll be better to wait until it stops flowing so fast.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.500
Well, perhaps you're right.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.500
So what's this big secret all about?

09:06.500 --> 09:08.500
Hey, Moonman.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.500
Have you ever seen a dragon snuffkin?

09:11.500 --> 09:16.500
No, of course not. They all disappeared off the face of the earth many hundreds of years ago.

09:16.500 --> 09:21.500
But perhaps they didn't all disappear. What if there was one alive somewhere?

09:21.500 --> 09:23.500
That's impossible.

09:23.500 --> 09:26.500
It could be so small that it would go in a glass jar, snuffkin.

09:26.500 --> 09:31.500
Are you sure you're not daydreaming, Moonman? But still, anything is possible, I suppose.

09:31.500 --> 09:35.500
But you know me. I have to see it right in front of me before I believe it.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.500
Oh!

09:41.500 --> 09:43.500
Oh, where is it?

09:44.500 --> 09:46.500
Oh, where is it?

09:46.500 --> 09:49.500
Mama promised me that she wouldn't let anyone in.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.500
It's not here either.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.500
Well, you were right, Moonman.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.500
Huh?

10:04.500 --> 10:06.500
Ah, there he is.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
I think you've found a real dragon.

10:08.500 --> 10:12.500
How do you get up there? He must have full. He might lose his tail.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.500
Oh, little dragon. And snuffkin, keep quiet.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.500
You might get frightened and do something silly.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.500
Don't worry. I'll soon have you down.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.500
This will do. I'll lay it on the floor here.

10:22.500 --> 10:25.500
Jump, little dragon. Don't be afraid.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.500
Come on. Hold on to this. It will bring you down slowly.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.500
Don't panic.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.500
I don't think it's a very good idea, Moonman.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.500
You'll only scare him away.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.500
Why don't you just leave him alone?

10:37.500 --> 10:41.500
He'll come down when he's ready. Dragons aren't helpless, you know. Even little baby ones.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.500
But he's so small. Come to Moonman.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.500
Come on. Don't you understand?

10:47.500 --> 10:49.500
Hold on to that and I'll listen to that.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.500
Look at him.

11:02.500 --> 11:06.500
My dragon can fly. He's flying. He's flying.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.500
Come down, little dragon. You might question or something.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.500
Come down.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.500
Be careful snuffkin. He might bite.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.500
I don't think so. He's a very unusual pet.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.500
I think he likes you more than me.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.500
What a charming little creature, Moonman.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.500
He's lovely. What's his name?

11:54.500 --> 11:56.500
He's called Little Dragon.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.500
Ha. I don't think he's lovely at all.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.500
Small but savage, if you ask my opinion.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.500
That sounds just like you, little my.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.500
You think so?

12:05.500 --> 12:06.500
Ow!

12:09.500 --> 12:11.500
Ow, ow, ow.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.500
Now look here.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.500
He seems to have a thing about ears, doesn't he?

12:22.500 --> 12:24.500
Step snuffkins. Why doesn't he bite him?

12:24.500 --> 12:29.500
Go on, dragon. Go on, bite him. He's really tasty. Go on.

12:30.500 --> 12:35.500
Good news. I think he's trying to heat up snuffkins coffee. He must really like him.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.500
Clevver, little sea.

12:40.500 --> 12:44.500
Well, I hope he's careful with that hot breath. We don't want to start a fire.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.500
All right, that's enough.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.500
He might be useful. When he's bigger, we can put him in the cellar

12:51.500 --> 12:54.500
and he'll be able to heat the whole house just like a furnace.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.500
No, we will not.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.500
Go away! You pass!

13:08.500 --> 13:10.500
Ow!

13:10.500 --> 13:12.500
And you!

13:12.500 --> 13:15.500
He only thought you were trying to get his fly.

13:15.500 --> 13:19.500
I'll get him if he bites me again. Just you watch me do it.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.500
Come on, little dragon.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.500
Ow!

13:35.500 --> 13:39.500
I'm sure that'll keep him quiet. That better go. Thanks for the coffee, Mumma.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.500
Oh no, it'll suffocate him.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.500
He only seems to like snuffkin.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.500
Well, we all like snuffkin.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.500
Stupid old dragon.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.500
No, he isn't.

14:22.500 --> 14:27.500
Mum and dear, why don't you take him to your room? He'll be happier there.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.500
This will be best for him.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.500
Oh, I wonder if he'll come back to visit us.

14:38.500 --> 14:42.500
Why did you do that? He was cute and we could have always worn earmuffs.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.500
You can visit him in snuffkin's tent.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.500
I expect little dragons already sitting on his shoulder.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.500
It doesn't matter anyway, snuffkin's going south soon.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.500
They'll be able to go together.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.500
Oh, my dear, Mumma. Never mind.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.500
Well, you're a bit of a problem.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.500
I don't want you here, little dragon.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.500
Go on, go away. Go to Mumma.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.500
Don't do that.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.500
Oh, come on, please go to Mumma.

15:14.500 --> 15:17.500
Look, you're very nice and it'll be fun to have you along.

15:17.500 --> 15:21.500
But there's movement, and he'd know you were here and you'd be upset.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.500
Oh, there's another one.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.500
That's the fifth? Oh, dear.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.500
Hmm?

15:41.500 --> 15:43.500
Any luck?

15:43.500 --> 15:45.500
Not bad. Are you going far?

15:45.500 --> 15:47.500
Oh, I'm far away.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.500
Would you like some fresh fish?

15:50.500 --> 15:52.500
I'm sure you'll get hungry.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.500
Yeah, what do you want in return?

15:57.500 --> 15:59.500
A small favor.

16:05.500 --> 16:10.500
Take this as far as you can, open the lid and just leave it.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.500
What? Just leave it?

16:12.500 --> 16:17.500
Yes, in a nice quiet place, with lots and lots of flies.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.500
Flies? What's in there?

16:19.500 --> 16:20.500
A dragon.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.500
A dragon? Does it bite?

16:22.500 --> 16:23.500
Well, it might.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.500
This is a big favor. I don't even like minnows.

16:26.500 --> 16:29.500
Oh, they're not too bad if you roast them.

16:29.500 --> 16:33.500
Keep the lid on, but make sure you open it up later so it can catch the flies.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.500
All right, as long as it doesn't try to bite me.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.500
Don't worry, it won't.

16:51.500 --> 16:52.500
Hello.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.500
Hi.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.500
Oh, well, where is he?

16:56.500 --> 16:57.500
Who is that?

16:57.500 --> 17:00.500
My dragon. He must have come here, snuffkin.

17:01.500 --> 17:04.500
Oh, really? I thought he was home with you, sleeping in your room.

17:04.500 --> 17:07.500
No, I left him out.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.500
Ah, well, dragons are very fickle.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.500
All they really care about is big fat flies.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.500
It's best to forget about a moment.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.500
Did you catch your five minnows?

17:20.500 --> 17:23.500
No, you were right. The water's too fast.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.500
Oh, really?

17:24.500 --> 17:26.500
So I won't go south until winter comes.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.500
You'll stay here then?

17:28.500 --> 17:31.500
Well, I'm sure it wouldn't do to go against the cards.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.500
Now what a moment, my friend.

17:33.500 --> 17:36.500
Oh, that's great. You're staying snuffkin.

17:36.500 --> 17:40.500
That's fantastic. That's really, really good.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.500
Ah, perhaps I shouldn't have painted the float bright red.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.500
It might have scared those little minnows right away.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.500
Okay, let's go.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.500
Yeah.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.500
That dragon was sort of stupid.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.500
Baby dragons are.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
They make the world's worst pets.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.500
They never want to settle in one place.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.500
Yeah, you're right.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.500
It was very funny, though, when it bit little mice here.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.500
I think it gave her a taste of her own medicine.

18:08.500 --> 18:12.500
The movement was very happy that snuffkin was staying in movement valley

18:12.500 --> 18:15.500
and not going south until winter.

18:15.500 --> 18:21.500
And as for the dragon, well, who wants to be loved by a silly old dragon?

18:21.500 --> 18:28.500
They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.

18:28.500 --> 18:35.500
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

18:35.500 --> 18:39.500
They're always happy and always at play.

18:39.500 --> 18:43.500
The movements are having fun day after day.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.500
The movements.

18:46.500 --> 18:50.500
The movements.

18:50.500 --> 18:57.500
They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.

18:57.500 --> 19:04.500
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

19:04.500 --> 19:08.500
They're always happy and always at play.

19:08.500 --> 19:12.500
The movements are having fun day after day.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.500
The movements.

19:15.500 --> 19:19.500
The movements.

19:19.500 --> 19:26.500
The movements.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.500
Here they are for one another.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.500
The movements are about to come.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.500
Come on and sit down here with me.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.500
Therefore you want your TV.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.500
They are the movements.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.500
They are the movements.

20:02.500 --> 20:05.500
So come with me, give me your hand.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.500
I'll take you up to a movement land.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.500
You can fly just like a bird.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.500
Sing that song ever.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.500
There were the movements.

20:16.500 --> 20:21.500
There were the movements.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.500
There were the movements.

20:23.500 --> 20:26.500
There were the movements.

20:26.500 --> 20:30.500
There were the movements.

20:30.500 --> 21:00.500
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

21:30.500 --> 21:32.500
Have you found a new plant or something?

21:32.500 --> 21:37.500
I'm afraid not, and I think I must have examined every single plant in Moomin Valley.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.500
I know what you mean.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.500
There isn't a single person living here that I don't know.

21:42.500 --> 21:45.500
Oh, yes, yes, quite.

21:45.500 --> 21:50.500
Look, why don't you come over and have a cup of tea, Mr. Evelyn?

21:50.500 --> 21:52.500
Hmm?

21:52.500 --> 21:55.500
Isn't that Moomin and little Mai?

21:55.500 --> 21:57.500
Yes, I think it is.

21:57.500 --> 22:00.500
Really, a moment, Papa, peeping into people's homes.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.500
Oh, it's an empty house, Mr. Evelyn.

22:03.500 --> 22:07.500
Oh, it's an empty house, Mr. Evelyn.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.500
Moomin, what are you looking at?

22:10.500 --> 22:13.500
Oh, what are you looking at?

22:13.500 --> 22:15.500
I'm not looking at you.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.500
I'm not looking at you.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.500
Moomin, what are you looking at?

22:20.500 --> 22:21.500
Oh, hello, Papa.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.500
Nobody's lived in there for years.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.500
Somebody's just moved in.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.500
Oh, really?

22:27.500 --> 22:30.500
Let me have a look.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.500
Oh, goodness.

22:32.500 --> 22:33.500
How tidy they are.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.500
Perhaps the children will play with us.

22:36.500 --> 22:39.500
Oh, they might, but they seem a bit too well behaved for that.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.500
I must have a closer look at them.

22:41.500 --> 22:45.500
Me too, Moomin, Papa, but the trouble is they never come outside the fence.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.500
Well, in that case, we'll have to go in.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.500
How do we do that, Papa?

22:49.500 --> 22:51.500
We can't just walk in there.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.500
See, you want to borrow some sugar?

22:53.500 --> 22:55.500
That should do it.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.500
Oh, Mr. Hamilton, where's your imagination?

22:58.500 --> 23:01.500
Will you please lend me your magnifying glass?

23:01.500 --> 23:02.500
But surely.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.500
Here it is.

23:04.500 --> 23:08.500
Oh, that should do it.

23:08.500 --> 23:13.500
What are you going to do, Papa?

23:13.500 --> 23:16.500
Now then, you all stay out here.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.500
My plan will only work if it looks as though I'm on my own.

23:19.500 --> 23:23.500
Oh, but what is your plan, Papa?

23:33.500 --> 23:35.500
I hope Papa knows what he's doing.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.500
They don't look that friendly to me.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.500
Me neither.

23:43.500 --> 23:51.500
Mama, there's someone coming.

23:51.500 --> 23:55.500
Oh, what do you want, my good man?

23:55.500 --> 23:57.500
Come on, tell me quickly.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.500
Do you hear me?

23:59.500 --> 24:01.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.500
I didn't think anyone lived here.

24:03.500 --> 24:06.500
Well, we do know you know we just moved in.

24:06.500 --> 24:07.500
Really?

24:07.500 --> 24:09.500
Oh, do forgive me, madame.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.500
I certainly didn't mean to trespass.

24:11.500 --> 24:14.500
Ah, so what are you doing here in the garden, man?

24:14.500 --> 24:17.500
Researching the travel system of ants.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.500
I didn't know they had one.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.500
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's fascinating.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.500
How they find their way and build their roads,

24:23.500 --> 24:25.500
and they're not here now, of course.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.500
But this is their main road.

24:27.500 --> 24:30.500
It's very quiet at the moment, but at busy times, it's packed.

24:30.500 --> 24:33.500
I'm afraid I can't see any main road.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.500
Oh, you would if you were an expert.

24:35.500 --> 24:38.500
Anyway, I'll point it out to you next time they're on the move

24:38.500 --> 24:41.500
in the vicinity, of course, but it's worth looking out for.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.500
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.500
I'm your next door neighbor, though.

24:45.500 --> 24:46.500
We live quite a long way away.

24:46.500 --> 24:47.500
I'm Moomin.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.500
Ah, so you must be Moomin Papa, aren't you?

24:50.500 --> 24:52.500
Yes, that's me.

24:52.500 --> 24:55.500
How did you know?

24:55.500 --> 24:58.500
Did someone mention my name to you?

24:58.500 --> 25:02.500
We were told the movements were a bit unusual.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.500
Very nice, they said, though.

25:04.500 --> 25:07.500
How very flattering, thank you.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.500
And you're Mrs.

25:10.500 --> 25:13.500
Billy Junk, mother and housewife.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.500
Well, it's an honour to meet you, Mrs. Philly Junk.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.500
Well done, Papa.

25:18.500 --> 25:21.500
It looks like you found us some new friends to play with.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.500
Oh, welcome, party.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.500
Don't you think it's a good idea?

25:25.500 --> 25:28.500
We haven't had a party for ages, Mama.

25:28.500 --> 25:32.500
But you hardly know them, and I've never even met them.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.500
But Mama, how can we show them that they're really welcome

25:35.500 --> 25:38.500
if they could meet everyone at a party, couldn't they?

25:38.500 --> 25:40.500
And I could take care of all the children.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.500
I know just what to do.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.500
Splendid, Moomin.

25:44.500 --> 25:47.500
Ah, Mr. Hebblin, I know Moomin Papa.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.500
You'd like me to do the fireworks.

25:49.500 --> 25:52.500
It looks like we're throwing a party.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.500
We'll have lots of pretty flowers.

25:57.500 --> 26:01.500
Just tell me what you want, Mama, and we'll do it.

26:05.500 --> 26:08.500
It's great.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.500
Those kids will just love it.

26:10.500 --> 26:13.500
If they survive, Moomin.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.500
Now then, children.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.500
The Moomin's are all a little bit odd.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.500
So behead properly.

26:33.500 --> 26:36.500
Yes, mother, we will.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.500
They'll be here soon.

26:40.500 --> 26:42.500
Take this in, Moomin.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.500
Okay.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.500
The children work really well.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.500
Good. I must try it.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.500
Mmm, these look nice.

26:50.500 --> 26:53.500
Oh, stiff. Leave them alone, will you?

26:53.500 --> 26:56.500
Oh, all right. Just this one.

26:56.500 --> 26:58.500
Huh?

26:58.500 --> 27:00.500
Huh? They're here.

27:00.500 --> 27:03.500
Come on, everybody. They'll soon be at the door.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.500
Right. Come on, children.

27:05.500 --> 27:08.500
Help me with the flowers.

27:10.500 --> 27:13.500
Oh, dear. Fireworks now are later on.

27:13.500 --> 27:17.500
Oh, later on. I think you'll very whole-finally.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.500
Welcome to Moomin House, Mrs. Fitzgerald.

27:25.500 --> 27:28.500
It was very kind of you to invite us, Moomin, Mama.

27:28.500 --> 27:31.500
Come in, please, and make yourselves at home.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.500
Oh, thank you all very much indeed.

27:39.500 --> 27:42.500
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

27:42.500 --> 27:46.500
Oh, all in my hair.

27:46.500 --> 27:49.500
It looks very untidy, doesn't it, mother?

27:49.500 --> 27:52.500
It's a surprise. They should have been rose buds,

27:52.500 --> 27:54.500
but we couldn't find any at all.

27:54.500 --> 27:57.500
Oh, yes. Dear, what a mess.

27:57.500 --> 28:02.500
Oh, Mrs. Philly chunk, let me introduce the children.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.500
They all look different.

28:04.500 --> 28:07.500
Well, yes. Only Moomin is really ours.

28:07.500 --> 28:12.500
The others are sort of, uh, I'm sure they'll all get on.

28:12.500 --> 28:15.500
Oh, I'm afraid my children do not play.

28:15.500 --> 28:18.500
They would much rather read or study.

28:18.500 --> 28:22.500
Oh, are you sure they've got to have some time for play?

28:22.500 --> 28:24.500
I'm sure.

28:25.500 --> 28:29.500
Well, come into the dining room anyway.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.500
You can watch the others play.

28:31.500 --> 28:34.500
Make sure the chairs are clean.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.500
Yes, mother, we will.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.500
Won't you let them play at all?

28:41.500 --> 28:43.500
No, I will not.

28:48.500 --> 28:49.500
Come on, everybody.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.500
Wouldn't you like to have a go on our slide?

28:51.500 --> 28:53.500
No.

28:53.500 --> 28:56.500
Hmm. You'd really enjoy it once you got going.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.500
I know you would.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.500
No, thank you. No, no, not at all.

29:00.500 --> 29:03.500
No, definitely not.

29:03.500 --> 29:06.500
And you're really quite sure, are you?

29:06.500 --> 29:08.500
Yes.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.500
I thought so.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.500
Then we've got it all to ourselves.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.500
Yahoo!

29:24.500 --> 29:27.500
Moomin sounds like he's having fun.

29:37.500 --> 29:40.500
Oh, and that's little Mayan sniff.

29:40.500 --> 29:43.500
Your children seem very quiet, Mrs. Billy Junk.

29:43.500 --> 29:47.500
Good children are seen and not heard, my dear.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.500
That was one of mine.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.500
And that was another.

29:55.500 --> 29:58.500
Well, it sounds like they're having fun for once.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.500
Now, have a biscuit, Mrs. Billy Junk.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.500
They have an unusual taste.

30:02.500 --> 30:05.500
I'd run out of flowers, so I used them.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.500
Don't worry.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.500
Moomin will look after them.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.500
Go on, it's your turn now.

30:23.500 --> 30:25.500
My children.

30:31.500 --> 30:33.500
Stop it. It's too dangerous.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.500
You might hurt yourself.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.500
Oh, come on, stop it at once.

30:42.500 --> 30:44.500
Now, don't you worry, Mrs. Billy Junk.

30:44.500 --> 30:47.500
I've got ointment in my bag if they hurt themselves.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.500
But you'll hear mother.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.500
Stop children, you hear me.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.500
We're going home now.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.500
Stop it.

30:59.500 --> 31:01.500
Oh, this is great.

31:01.500 --> 31:04.500
It's time for the glorious finale, Papa.

31:04.500 --> 31:07.500
I can't say I wasn't warned.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.500
Exposing them to this.

31:10.500 --> 31:13.500
Moomin Valley is no place for proper children.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.500
No place for children.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.500
No place for children.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.500
No place for children.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.500
No place for children.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.500
No place at all.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.500
Oh, dear, what's this?

31:26.500 --> 31:29.500
There are fireworks in your honor.

31:29.500 --> 31:30.500
Fireworks.

31:31.500 --> 31:34.500
I made them especially to welcome you.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.500
Goodbye, come back soon.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.500
Yeah, we'll come tomorrow.

31:51.500 --> 31:53.500
No, you will not.

31:53.500 --> 31:56.500
I don't think Mrs. Billy Junk enjoyed her party.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.500
She's very lucky that I didn't bite her.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.500
She should have had a go on the slide.

32:02.500 --> 32:04.500
I'm sure she would have loved it,

32:04.500 --> 32:06.500
and then she wouldn't have shouted at her children.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.500
Don't, don't slide down, shoot, sniff.

32:08.500 --> 32:10.500
They're too afraid of looking silly.

32:10.500 --> 32:12.500
Whoa!

32:12.500 --> 32:14.500
Oh, oh.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.500
Papa.

32:16.500 --> 32:19.500
Oh, I'm very sorry, Moomin, but don't worry.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.500
I'll fix it.

32:20.500 --> 32:21.500
Is it nothing much broken?

32:21.500 --> 32:23.500
What happened, my dear?

32:23.500 --> 32:28.500
Well, I thought it had been such a long time since I'd been on the slide that I'd have a go.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.500
I didn't think I'd be too heavy for it.

32:32.500 --> 32:33.500
I know.

32:33.500 --> 32:37.500
When we mend it, why don't we make it strong enough for me and Mama to play on as well?

32:37.500 --> 32:39.500
I think she'd like that.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.500
That's a good idea, Papa.

32:41.500 --> 32:43.500
But we want to use it, too.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.500
Well, that's a cool idea.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.500
I'll just try it out, now and again.

32:57.500 --> 33:00.500
I want you to stay here while I'm out.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.500
What if somebody asks us to play?

33:02.500 --> 33:04.500
What do you mean, play?

33:06.500 --> 33:09.500
I hope you're not thinking of the Moomin, are you?

33:09.500 --> 33:14.500
I don't want you mixing with those noisy children ever again, do you hear me?

33:14.500 --> 33:16.500
Where are you going, mother?

33:16.500 --> 33:18.500
To look for another house.

33:18.500 --> 33:21.500
It was a terrible mistake coming to Moomin Valley.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.500
Look, there's Mrs. Philly drunk.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.500
Good afternoon.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.500
Please stay away from my children.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.500
But why?

33:38.500 --> 33:41.500
We thought they might like to come and have an adventure with us.

33:43.500 --> 33:44.500
Oh, never mind.

33:44.500 --> 33:45.500
Let's go.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.500
Hey, hang on a minute.

34:08.500 --> 34:10.500
Oh, you're Tarzan.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.500
I can't take it.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.500
It's too late for you now, Sniff.

34:27.500 --> 34:31.500
Oh, no, not the hungry crocodile at the bottom of the porch.

34:31.500 --> 34:34.500
We should have brought the Philly Junks with us.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.500
But Moomin missed his Philly Junks.

34:36.500 --> 34:38.500
He's not told her.

34:38.500 --> 34:41.500
Have you been killed and eaten yet, Sniff?

34:41.500 --> 34:47.500
No, I fell on top of the crocodile and knocked him out and then swam me shore.

34:47.500 --> 34:50.500
Sniff, but I thought you couldn't swim.

34:50.500 --> 34:53.500
On your own business.

34:53.500 --> 34:56.500
Hey, that looks like the Philly Junks.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.500
Why don't they come over here?

35:03.500 --> 35:06.500
I bet their mother told them not to talk to us.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.500
See if I care you.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.500
Hey, what are you doing?

35:20.500 --> 35:23.500
Why aren't you playing with Moomin and the others?

35:23.500 --> 35:25.500
I don't think they want to play with us.

35:25.500 --> 35:28.500
They didn't call for us when they weren't past.

35:28.500 --> 35:32.500
Stinky's arrived and wonder what he's doing here.

35:32.500 --> 35:35.500
I bet you it's no fun stuck in that garden.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.500
No, we'd rather be out here playing.

35:38.500 --> 35:41.500
Well, I know somewhere much better than Moomin's.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.500
It's a great place to play.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.500
Do you?

35:44.500 --> 35:45.500
Yes, would I lie to you?

35:45.500 --> 35:48.500
It's a bit of a way off, but it'll be really exciting and lots of fun.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.500
So do you want to come or not?

35:50.500 --> 35:52.500
Well, it is a bit boring here.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.500
Yes, very.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.500
Do you really think they don't want to play with us?

35:57.500 --> 35:59.500
Doesn't it look like it?

35:59.500 --> 36:01.500
There's absolutely right.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.500
So come on if you're coming because I can't wait.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.500
What stinky up to?

36:05.500 --> 36:07.500
I don't trust him.

36:22.500 --> 36:25.500
Okay, now this is the place I told you about.

36:25.500 --> 36:26.500
Good, isn't it?

36:26.500 --> 36:31.500
Now, if you hang on to that rope, you can swing over to the other side and back again.

36:31.500 --> 36:34.500
Don't worry, it's quite safe.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.500
That's great.

36:36.500 --> 36:39.500
I've never been anywhere like this.

36:39.500 --> 36:41.500
A bit frightening.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.500
Without the thrill, where's the fun?

36:44.500 --> 36:47.500
You need a bit of danger to spice it up.

36:47.500 --> 36:51.500
Gee, Willikers, it looks like the other side is harder than this side.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.500
Yes, I bet it's all right.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.500
You just have to put your legs up, that's all.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.500
Who wants to go first?

36:57.500 --> 37:01.500
I've got it. Why don't you all go together?

37:01.500 --> 37:03.500
What? The three of us?

37:03.500 --> 37:06.500
See, this way you won't feel so scared, Willik.

37:06.500 --> 37:08.500
No, not together.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.500
Well, why don't you go one at a time then?

37:11.500 --> 37:14.500
That way it's always more fun.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.500
Can you do it, stinky?

37:16.500 --> 37:18.500
Don't be silly. Of course I can.

37:18.500 --> 37:19.500
I do it all the time.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.500
One of the things I'm best at.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.500
Even if I do say so myself.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.500
So, why don't you show us, stinky?

37:26.500 --> 37:28.500
Moonman!

37:28.500 --> 37:30.500
I didn't know you were such a robespringer, stinky.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.500
I'm sure he didn't either.

37:33.500 --> 37:37.500
So, this is your usual place, is it?

37:37.500 --> 37:39.500
Well, sort of.

37:39.500 --> 37:40.500
You know something?

37:40.500 --> 37:43.500
If you hadn't said that you'd done this lots of times,

37:43.500 --> 37:46.500
I wouldn't have believed that I could have done it myself.

37:46.500 --> 37:49.500
Come on, stinky. Show us how you do it.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.500
If you go first, I'll be second.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.500
No, it's all right. You can go first, moment.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.500
Hello, I want to see how it's done.

37:57.500 --> 38:00.500
Then throw me the rope, and I'll follow.

38:00.500 --> 38:02.500
Now, tell the truth.

38:02.500 --> 38:04.500
You've never done it. Have you, stinky?

38:04.500 --> 38:07.500
Of course I've done it, stupid.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.500
Now, come on. Come on.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.500
Don't be such a spoiled sport.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.500
We're all here waiting to cheer you on.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.500
All right, everybody.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.500
I give you the brave and bold Tarzan, stinky.

38:18.500 --> 38:19.500
Are you watching?

38:19.500 --> 38:21.500
Are you ready, stinky?

38:21.500 --> 38:23.500
A big cheer, everyone.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.500
Waiting for you.

38:25.500 --> 38:28.500
Oh, stinky, my big brave hero, jump.

38:28.500 --> 38:31.500
Well, go on. We're all waiting for you, stinky.

38:31.500 --> 38:33.500
Come on, stinky. Show us how it's done.

38:33.500 --> 38:34.500
Come on, stinky.

38:34.500 --> 38:35.500
Come on, stinky.

38:35.500 --> 38:36.500
Come on, stinky.

38:36.500 --> 38:37.500
Come on, stinky.

38:42.500 --> 38:45.500
Ah!

38:46.500 --> 38:49.500
Oh, so this is how you've done it lots of times before, is it?

38:49.500 --> 38:51.500
Yes, the rope must have shrunk.

38:51.500 --> 38:52.500
Oh!

38:52.500 --> 38:54.500
He was trying to fool you.

38:54.500 --> 38:58.500
It was a dangerous game, and he knew very well it couldn't be done.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.500
I did it!

39:00.500 --> 39:03.500
Now, why don't you come with us and play properly?

39:03.500 --> 39:06.500
You're gonna be Tarzan as long as you like.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.500
And we're all here.

39:08.500 --> 39:10.500
Oh, you're gonna be fine.

39:10.500 --> 39:13.500
Now, why don't you come with us and play properly?

39:13.500 --> 39:15.500
You're gonna be Tarzan as long as you like.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.500
And when you get tired, just let go of the rope.

39:17.500 --> 39:18.500
All right, stinky.

39:18.500 --> 39:20.500
Come on, stinky.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.500
Yeah!

39:21.500 --> 39:24.500
You can't just leave me here, you fox.

39:24.500 --> 39:25.500
Ah!

39:25.500 --> 39:27.500
It isn't fair, please.

39:27.500 --> 39:28.500
Help!

39:28.500 --> 39:31.500
Don't leave me here.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.500
Woo!

39:39.500 --> 39:42.500
Woo!

39:42.500 --> 39:43.500
Yeah!

39:43.500 --> 39:48.500
But stinky was left on his own to decide whether to climb up the rope or drop into the river.

39:48.500 --> 39:51.500
And the filajong children had more fun than they'd ever had before,

39:51.500 --> 39:54.500
but they didn't get home until very late in the evening.

39:54.500 --> 39:57.500
Bye, we'll see you tomorrow.

39:57.500 --> 39:58.500
Okay, mommy.

39:58.500 --> 39:59.500
Bye, momen.

39:59.500 --> 40:00.500
Bye-bye.

40:00.500 --> 40:01.500
Bye-bye.

40:04.500 --> 40:07.500
Oh, my dear children, I told you to stay at home!

40:07.500 --> 40:10.500
What earth have you been? Where have you been?

40:10.500 --> 40:12.500
With movement of the others.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.500
They kidnapped you, did they?

40:14.500 --> 40:16.500
No, we've been playing with them.

40:16.500 --> 40:21.500
Well, you can just forget about the movements we're moving out as soon as we possibly can.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.500
Moving, mother?

40:22.500 --> 40:28.500
Yes, right away from this valley, this is no place for a spotless and well-ordered home.

40:28.500 --> 40:31.500
What's the matter?

40:31.500 --> 40:33.500
No, we don't want to move.

40:33.500 --> 40:34.500
Ah!

40:34.500 --> 40:36.500
We want to stay, mother.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.500
Oh!

40:39.500 --> 40:41.500
Movement house is nice and dusty.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.500
We want to stay in the movement valley forever.

40:43.500 --> 40:46.500
Oh, please, mother, we love it here.

40:46.500 --> 40:49.500
Oh, after all I've done for you children.

40:49.500 --> 40:54.500
And my experience children usually get what they want.

41:06.500 --> 41:21.500
And that was how Phila John and her three children became permanent residents.

41:21.500 --> 41:39.500
And that was how Phila John and her three children became permanent residents of movement valley.

41:39.500 --> 41:46.500
They loved the laughter and they loved the living the movements.

41:46.500 --> 41:53.500
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

41:53.500 --> 41:57.500
They're always happy and always at play.

41:57.500 --> 42:01.500
The movements are having fun day after day.

42:01.500 --> 42:04.500
The movements.

42:04.500 --> 42:08.500
The movements.

42:08.500 --> 42:15.500
They loved the laughter and they loved the living the movements.

42:15.500 --> 42:22.500
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

42:22.500 --> 42:26.500
They're always happy and always at play.

42:26.500 --> 42:30.500
The movements are having fun day after day.

42:30.500 --> 42:33.500
The movements.

42:33.500 --> 42:37.500
The movements.

42:37.500 --> 42:44.500
The movements.

43:07.500 --> 43:14.500
The movements.

43:14.500 --> 43:19.500
The movements.

43:19.500 --> 43:23.500
The movements.

43:23.500 --> 43:29.500
The movements.

43:29.500 --> 43:34.500
The movements.

43:34.500 --> 43:41.500
There were the movements.

43:41.500 --> 43:48.500
There were the movements.

43:48.500 --> 43:55.500
The movements.

43:55.500 --> 44:00.500
The movements.

44:00.500 --> 44:06.500
The movements.

44:06.500 --> 44:12.500
The movements.

44:12.500 --> 44:19.500
The movements.

44:19.500 --> 44:26.500
The movements.

44:26.500 --> 44:38.500
For a whole week, snort maiden had been curled up on the sofa, reading fairy tales.

44:38.500 --> 44:50.500
It's a lovely day and at last movement is persuaded to come out for a walk in the lonely mountains.

44:50.500 --> 44:56.500
It's beautiful up here, aren't you glad you came now?

44:56.500 --> 45:01.500
This is much better than fairy tales, isn't it snort maiden?

45:01.500 --> 45:08.500
Oh look, moment, it's Adelweis.

45:08.500 --> 45:12.500
No, it isn't. That doesn't grow here at all.

45:12.500 --> 45:15.500
I'm sure it is. I know what it looks like.

45:15.500 --> 45:18.500
I'm sorry, but it's not.

45:18.500 --> 45:21.500
Oh, it's just like in Heidi.

45:21.500 --> 45:23.500
No, it's not. It's just a daisy.

45:23.500 --> 45:26.500
Oh, come on. I want to pick it.

45:26.500 --> 45:28.500
Oh, no, it's too dangerous.

45:28.500 --> 45:33.500
I know then. You can do it. You're my boyfriend, aren't you, Moomin?

45:33.500 --> 45:37.500
Well, I suppose we could climb down there, but I promise you it's not Adelweis.

45:37.500 --> 45:41.500
That only grows in the Alps and there are hundreds of miles away.

45:41.500 --> 45:47.500
I know it's Adelweis.

45:47.500 --> 45:51.500
Be careful. They don't care about danger in fairy tales.

45:51.500 --> 45:56.500
That's why they call them fairy tales, silly.

45:59.500 --> 46:03.500
Fairy Princess, please accept this, my humble offering.

46:03.500 --> 46:07.500
Thank you, Brave Knight. You were right, Moomin. This isn't Adelweis.

46:07.500 --> 46:12.500
See, I told you, it's going to be hard to get down from here, you know?

46:12.500 --> 46:15.500
Can't we go back the way we came?

46:15.500 --> 46:19.500
Well, I think it'll be easier to try to get to that path.

46:19.500 --> 46:22.500
If you say so.

46:23.500 --> 46:27.500
It's nearer anyway, and better than going up.

46:27.500 --> 46:31.500
I'm surprised you're such a good climber.

46:31.500 --> 46:35.500
Oh, Royalty is good at practically everything.

46:35.500 --> 46:39.500
Oh, it's not made of.

46:39.500 --> 46:49.500
It's not made of.

46:49.500 --> 46:56.500
It's not made of.

46:56.500 --> 47:02.500
It's not made of.

47:02.500 --> 47:09.500
Let me see six pebbles.

47:09.500 --> 47:14.500
What was that, a giant snowball? It can't be, it isn't winter.

47:14.500 --> 47:20.500
Well, nothing of interest to me. Now, where was I?

47:20.500 --> 47:24.500
We start hemulating. Has Snork Maiden just gone past you?

47:24.500 --> 47:28.500
Snork Maiden. No, all I've seen going past is a very large snowball.

47:28.500 --> 47:30.500
That was Snork Maiden.

47:30.500 --> 47:34.500
But she's not made of snow.

47:34.500 --> 47:40.500
Stop! Snork Maiden, stop!

47:41.500 --> 47:46.500
Snork Maiden!

47:46.500 --> 47:50.500
Snork Maiden!

47:50.500 --> 48:03.500
Oh, I'll praise the boob all she's still breathing. She's just knocked herself out.

48:04.500 --> 48:10.500
Oh, Mom, what's happened to her?

48:10.500 --> 48:12.500
She's unconscious.

48:12.500 --> 48:14.500
Oh, what are you trying to do?

48:14.500 --> 48:17.500
I want to get her home to Mama.

48:17.500 --> 48:20.500
Oh, difficult. She should lose a bit of weight.

48:20.500 --> 48:25.500
Perhaps she'd come around if we splashed cold water on her face.

48:25.500 --> 48:29.500
Oh, there's nothing to fetch it in.

48:29.500 --> 48:34.500
Ah, if you cut some bark off a tree trunk, you could make a small container.

48:34.500 --> 48:38.500
What a good idea. If you stay here, I'll go and do that.

48:41.500 --> 48:44.500
Wake up, Snork Maiden.

48:44.500 --> 48:57.500
Oh, that's cold.

48:57.500 --> 49:07.500
Has she come around yet, Mr. Himulet?

49:07.500 --> 49:08.500
No.

49:08.500 --> 49:12.500
Okay.

49:13.500 --> 49:15.500
Oh, good. It's working.

49:15.500 --> 49:18.500
How are you feeling, Snork Maiden?

49:18.500 --> 49:21.500
Are you all right, Snork Maiden?

49:21.500 --> 49:23.500
Where am I?

49:23.500 --> 49:26.500
We're still up in Lonely Mountains.

49:26.500 --> 49:28.500
Who am I?

49:28.500 --> 49:33.500
Why Royal Highness the Princess of Lonely Mountains?

49:33.500 --> 49:35.500
What? A Princess?

49:35.500 --> 49:39.500
Oh, yes, of course.

49:39.500 --> 49:40.500
And who are you?

49:40.500 --> 49:43.500
I am the Prince of Lonely Mountains.

49:43.500 --> 49:44.500
Oh, yeah.

49:44.500 --> 49:45.500
Oh, yeah.

49:45.500 --> 49:47.500
With that ridiculous shape?

49:47.500 --> 49:48.500
No.

49:48.500 --> 49:50.500
A gesture, perhaps.

49:50.500 --> 49:52.500
You want?

49:52.500 --> 49:53.500
You there.

49:53.500 --> 49:56.500
Do not laugh.

50:04.500 --> 50:07.500
I think the poor girl must have lost her memory.

50:07.500 --> 50:10.500
Of course not. She's just pretending.

50:10.500 --> 50:14.500
One does not whisper with royalty present.

50:14.500 --> 50:15.500
Do you hear?

50:15.500 --> 50:20.500
So sorry, Royal Highness.

50:20.500 --> 50:23.500
A poor crafters cabin.

50:23.500 --> 50:25.500
This is your castle, ma'am.

50:25.500 --> 50:27.500
Royalty doesn't live in shacks.

50:27.500 --> 50:29.500
Snork Maiden.

50:29.500 --> 50:31.500
Stop calling us that.

50:31.500 --> 50:33.500
It's very rude.

50:33.500 --> 50:35.500
Oh, forgive me.

50:35.500 --> 50:38.500
Our royal castle is elsewhere.

50:38.500 --> 50:39.500
Is it not?

50:39.500 --> 50:40.500
What?

50:40.500 --> 50:42.500
That must be hunting lodge.

50:42.500 --> 50:44.500
No, of course that's what it is.

50:44.500 --> 50:47.500
Good. We accept that.

50:55.500 --> 50:59.500
Are you two going to tell me what you're so busy looking at?

50:59.500 --> 51:08.500
Send a maid to my room, my good man.

51:08.500 --> 51:11.500
A maid?

51:11.500 --> 51:15.500
My good man.

51:19.500 --> 51:22.500
Papa, have you seen Snork Maiden?

51:22.500 --> 51:25.500
Yes, up there.

51:26.500 --> 51:31.500
Mama, please would you go on have a word with Snork Maiden?

51:31.500 --> 51:33.500
Have you been quarreling?

51:33.500 --> 51:34.500
Oh, no.

51:34.500 --> 51:36.500
It's just that she fell and banged her head.

51:36.500 --> 51:39.500
And now she thinks she's a royal princess.

51:39.500 --> 51:42.500
What?

51:48.500 --> 51:51.500
Ah, Nanette! Come here, please.

51:51.500 --> 51:52.500
Nanette?

51:52.500 --> 51:54.500
I'm Boomin, Mama.

51:54.500 --> 51:57.500
Oh, we're too weary for your foolish jokes, girl.

51:57.500 --> 52:01.500
Oh, we are very tired indeed, Nanette.

52:01.500 --> 52:05.500
Please bring our silk nighty with the hand embroidered swans and clowns.

52:05.500 --> 52:08.500
Then you may go.

52:12.500 --> 52:13.500
I wish you, Mama.

52:13.500 --> 52:15.500
All right, I'm sure.

52:15.500 --> 52:17.500
But she seems convinced she's a princess.

52:17.500 --> 52:20.500
Sounds as if it's dangerous, doesn't it, Mama?

52:20.500 --> 52:21.500
Oh, I don't think so.

52:21.500 --> 52:24.500
I was only joking when I called her a princess.

52:24.500 --> 52:27.500
I'm very glad you didn't call her an opera singer.

52:27.500 --> 52:29.500
Is Snork Maiden asleep now?

52:29.500 --> 52:30.500
Oh, yes.

52:30.500 --> 52:33.500
In a night gown with crowns and swans embroidered on it.

52:33.500 --> 52:36.500
And another thing, Boomin, she wants a canopy put up immediately.

52:36.500 --> 52:38.500
What's that?

52:38.500 --> 52:43.500
Oh, a fancy cover over the bed that's draped in silks, envelopes, and tassels.

52:43.500 --> 52:47.500
Oh, she was very upset because there wasn't one there already.

52:47.500 --> 52:49.500
It might not be necessary.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.500
Her memory could have come back by the time she wakes up.

52:51.500 --> 52:53.500
Why don't we wait and see?

52:53.500 --> 52:55.500
She might be fine after a rest.

52:55.500 --> 52:57.500
I sure hope so.

52:57.500 --> 53:00.500
But what do we do if it hasn't come back?

53:00.500 --> 53:02.500
Let's think about that if it happens.

53:02.500 --> 53:04.500
We might not have to build that canopy.

53:04.500 --> 53:06.500
Let me try it.

53:06.500 --> 53:07.500
Try what?

53:07.500 --> 53:09.500
To get Snork Maiden's memory back, what else?

53:09.500 --> 53:10.500
Oh, how?

53:10.500 --> 53:13.500
Well, I think that if she sees me, she'll remember me

53:13.500 --> 53:15.500
and then she'll remember everything else too.

53:15.500 --> 53:17.500
Don't be silly little Maiden.

53:17.500 --> 53:20.500
If she doesn't remember me, why should you remember you, eh?

53:20.500 --> 53:23.500
Simple, because I'm unforgettable.

53:23.500 --> 53:25.500
There is that, I suppose.

53:31.500 --> 53:33.500
She's still fast asleep.

53:33.500 --> 53:35.500
Well, I'm glad we made the canopy anyway.

53:35.500 --> 53:37.500
It looks really great, doesn't it?

53:39.500 --> 53:42.500
Oh, look, she's opening her eyes.

53:43.500 --> 53:45.500
Are you awake?

53:45.500 --> 53:47.500
Get up, Snork Maiden.

53:47.500 --> 53:48.500
Come on.

53:48.500 --> 53:50.500
Let's go down to the beach.

53:50.500 --> 53:52.500
And who is that person?

53:52.500 --> 53:54.500
Come on, you remember me.

53:54.500 --> 53:56.500
I warn you if you don't, you'll be sorry.

53:56.500 --> 53:58.500
Oh, quite amusing.

53:58.500 --> 54:00.500
Ah, so you remember me now.

54:00.500 --> 54:02.500
Of course we do.

54:02.500 --> 54:04.500
There you are, I told you.

54:04.500 --> 54:05.500
Who am I then?

54:05.500 --> 54:08.500
Well, you're another court jester.

54:08.500 --> 54:09.500
Of course.

54:09.500 --> 54:15.500
Don't be little like a court jester.

54:15.500 --> 54:19.500
Oh, very funny.

54:19.500 --> 54:21.500
She's a better clown than the other one.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.500
You can perform at our wedding.

54:23.500 --> 54:25.500
You're a wedding.

54:30.500 --> 54:33.500
Hey, hey, hey, boy.

54:33.500 --> 54:37.500
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

54:38.500 --> 54:40.500
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

54:40.500 --> 54:42.500
There you are.

54:47.500 --> 54:48.500
Hi, stinky.

54:48.500 --> 54:50.500
What are you doing here?

54:50.500 --> 54:52.500
A moment asked me to come over to a moment house

54:52.500 --> 54:55.500
and propose to some princess.

54:55.500 --> 54:57.500
Moments lost his marbles as well then.

54:57.500 --> 54:59.500
I think he wanted stinky as a contrast.

54:59.500 --> 55:01.500
You what?

55:01.500 --> 55:03.500
You mean to tell me you're both my rivals

55:03.500 --> 55:05.500
for the hands of the royal princess?

55:05.500 --> 55:07.500
Well, it's not very original.

55:07.500 --> 55:09.500
But in order to win the princess

55:09.500 --> 55:11.500
and have her kingdom stinky,

55:11.500 --> 55:13.500
you'll need to solve three riddles.

55:13.500 --> 55:14.500
Hey, that's great.

55:14.500 --> 55:17.500
What's this kingdom like?

55:17.500 --> 55:19.500
All right, sooner number one,

55:19.500 --> 55:20.500
you may now enter.

55:20.500 --> 55:22.500
Oh, that's me.

55:32.500 --> 55:33.500
Oh!

55:35.500 --> 55:37.500
Oh, hi, princess.

55:37.500 --> 55:39.500
How are you doing?

55:39.500 --> 55:41.500
Jester, is this man a suitor?

55:41.500 --> 55:43.500
He is.

55:43.500 --> 55:45.500
I fear he does not treat us with respect.

55:45.500 --> 55:47.500
Forgive him, your highness.

55:47.500 --> 55:49.500
He is from a foreign land.

55:49.500 --> 55:53.500
And does not know the ways of your kingdom.

55:53.500 --> 55:54.500
Hmm.

55:54.500 --> 55:56.500
Well, all right.

55:56.500 --> 55:57.500
Very well.

55:57.500 --> 55:58.500
Here is the first riddle.

55:58.500 --> 56:00.500
Are you ready?

56:00.500 --> 56:01.500
Are you away?

56:01.500 --> 56:02.500
Now then, listen.

56:02.500 --> 56:04.500
What is it that is yellow?

56:04.500 --> 56:06.500
Has four legs and sings.

56:06.500 --> 56:07.500
Oh, dear.

56:07.500 --> 56:09.500
An unusual canary?

56:09.500 --> 56:11.500
With four legs, you nincompoop.

56:11.500 --> 56:14.500
I don't know any birds with four legs.

56:14.500 --> 56:16.500
Who said it was a bird?

56:16.500 --> 56:17.500
All right, then.

56:17.500 --> 56:19.500
What's the answer, snark baby?

56:19.500 --> 56:21.500
He shows no respect.

56:21.500 --> 56:24.500
Throw him into a dungeon and give him no food.

56:24.500 --> 56:26.500
Your highness, he is temporarily out of his mind

56:26.500 --> 56:28.500
after a long journey here.

56:28.500 --> 56:29.500
Hang on.

56:29.500 --> 56:30.500
I'm not out of my mind.

56:30.500 --> 56:31.500
Shut up, kid.

56:31.500 --> 56:32.500
That's what's the answer.

56:32.500 --> 56:34.500
That's what I want to know.

56:34.500 --> 56:37.500
Silence, it does not concern you.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.500
We believe you to be of lowly birth.

56:45.500 --> 56:47.500
Sorry about this, napkin.

56:47.500 --> 56:48.500
Don't worry.

56:51.500 --> 56:52.500
Hmm.

56:52.500 --> 56:53.500
No, sir.

56:53.500 --> 56:54.500
Galad, but not bad.

56:54.500 --> 56:57.500
I am honored to be here, your royal highness.

56:57.500 --> 56:58.500
He'll do.

56:58.500 --> 57:00.500
An easy riddle to start.

57:00.500 --> 57:01.500
Here it is.

57:01.500 --> 57:05.500
First, what is the number of which we think?

57:05.500 --> 57:06.500
Take your time.

57:06.500 --> 57:07.500
Two?

57:07.500 --> 57:10.500
For a faux-galat night, that is correct.

57:10.500 --> 57:11.500
Now, listen.

57:11.500 --> 57:13.500
What is the word upon our mind?

57:13.500 --> 57:14.500
Love.

57:14.500 --> 57:15.500
That's amazing.

57:15.500 --> 57:18.500
Truly, the suitor has brains as well as looks.

57:18.500 --> 57:19.500
Question three.

57:19.500 --> 57:21.500
There are two numbers on our mind.

57:21.500 --> 57:22.500
What do they add up to?

57:22.500 --> 57:24.500
Answer carefully for it.

57:24.500 --> 57:26.500
Could unlock your princess's heart.

57:26.500 --> 57:27.500
21.

57:28.500 --> 57:29.500
Oh.

57:29.500 --> 57:31.500
Was that right, too?

57:31.500 --> 57:32.500
Oh, no.

57:32.500 --> 57:33.500
It was 22.

57:39.500 --> 57:41.500
My heart is heavy.

57:41.500 --> 57:44.500
For chance, we should have said it was correct.

57:44.500 --> 57:45.500
He was rather cute.

57:45.500 --> 57:47.500
Was he not just her?

57:47.500 --> 57:49.500
It's your turn now, stinky.

57:49.500 --> 57:52.500
Well, I suppose that even half of Snortiles

57:52.500 --> 57:53.500
would be something.

57:54.500 --> 57:57.500
Think she'll ever get her memory back?

57:57.500 --> 57:59.500
Of course she will.

57:59.500 --> 58:01.500
This is not our idea of a suitor.

58:01.500 --> 58:05.500
His heart is aching for you, royal highness.

58:05.500 --> 58:07.500
Ah, let it ache.

58:07.500 --> 58:08.500
Oh, alright.

58:08.500 --> 58:09.500
I'll give him a chance.

58:09.500 --> 58:11.500
Here is a question number one.

58:11.500 --> 58:13.500
What is the number we are thinking of?

58:13.500 --> 58:15.500
Well, of all our stupid questions.

58:15.500 --> 58:17.500
We haven't all day.

58:17.500 --> 58:19.500
Oh, well, oh.

58:21.500 --> 58:22.500
For.

58:22.500 --> 58:23.500
Indeed not.

58:23.500 --> 58:27.500
It is 3,598,765.

58:27.500 --> 58:29.500
Begone out.

58:29.500 --> 58:31.500
Please, Snortiles, let's up there.

58:31.500 --> 58:33.500
What room is up with his hands?

58:33.500 --> 58:35.500
It's not fair, right?

58:35.500 --> 58:36.500
Go home.

58:36.500 --> 58:39.500
I'll give you another one I want after.

58:39.500 --> 58:41.500
Oh, what a rude suitor.

58:41.500 --> 58:44.500
We are no longer in the mood for royal marriage, jester.

58:44.500 --> 58:46.500
At least not today.

58:46.500 --> 58:47.500
A wise decision.

58:47.500 --> 58:50.500
Oh, princess of the lonely mountains.

58:50.500 --> 58:52.500
They will be prostrated with grief,

58:52.500 --> 58:54.500
but bid the other suitors to go home.

58:54.500 --> 58:55.500
Do not let them beg.

58:55.500 --> 58:57.500
We would not like that.

58:57.500 --> 58:59.500
Very well, your royal highness.

58:59.500 --> 59:00.500
Do it kindly.

59:00.500 --> 59:01.500
We wish them no pain at all.

59:01.500 --> 59:03.500
From this day on, we shall devote ourselves

59:03.500 --> 59:06.500
to good works and to the well-being of our people.

59:06.500 --> 59:08.500
Oh.

59:08.500 --> 59:11.500
You, I didn't want to marry you anyway.

59:11.500 --> 59:13.500
Wonder what Snort-Mayton's up to now?

59:13.500 --> 59:15.500
Upstairs thinking.

59:15.500 --> 59:18.500
She says she'll devote her life to good works.

59:18.500 --> 59:21.500
Works, what works?

59:21.500 --> 59:23.500
I don't know, but she probably wants to be remembered

59:23.500 --> 59:25.500
in the history books.

59:25.500 --> 59:29.500
The princess who was adored by her subjects.

59:29.500 --> 59:32.500
Oh, she's coming down.

59:35.500 --> 59:36.500
Your royal highness.

59:36.500 --> 59:38.500
May I assist you?

59:38.500 --> 59:40.500
Send the net to us.

59:40.500 --> 59:42.500
She is on an errand, your highness.

59:42.500 --> 59:44.500
Then have someone else make soup?

59:44.500 --> 59:46.500
Nursing, but not too rich.

59:46.500 --> 59:48.500
Soup, highness?

59:48.500 --> 59:49.500
Yes, indeed.

59:49.500 --> 59:53.500
And then we shall take it to our poor subjects ourselves.

59:53.500 --> 59:55.500
What kind of soup?

59:55.500 --> 59:56.500
We don't know.

59:56.500 --> 59:57.500
We eat.

59:57.500 --> 59:58.500
We don't cook.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.500
The poor will be happy with anything brought

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.500
by the princess herself.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:03.500
Now hurry, man.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.500
Be quick about it.

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.500
No, she wants some soup.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.500
This will be ample.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.500
The poor do not eat much.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.500
It would only make the meal.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.500
I don't know anyone poor around here, your majesty.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.500
Nonsense.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:29.500
One, two, one, two, one.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.500
Greetings, jester.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.500
What now?

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.500
We're taking soup to the poor.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.500
Made with our own regal fingers.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.500
Do you know where they are, jester?

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:40.500
Your fingers?

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.500
Oh, I know.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.500
Good.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.500
Wonderful.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:44.500
Take us to them now.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.500
They will be so grateful.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.500
You bet, princess.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.500
That house there.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.500
Oh, yes.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.500
It's nice to know that the poor and my kingdom are so well off.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.500
Oh, you, please come over here.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.500
Hmm?

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.500
Will you?

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.500
I'm the princess of Lonely Mountain.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.500
Princess?

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.500
Oh, what moment you're all highness.

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.500
Do not keep us waiting.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.500
We have a lot to do.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.500
I'm coming.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.500
I'm coming.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.500
Forgive me, you're all highness.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.500
I had no idea you were...

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.500
My, my, smart maiden.

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.500
That common name again?

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:50.500
We are princess.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:51.500
Handle sticks.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.500
You're not right in the head coming here bothering your elders

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.500
and betters like this.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.500
My betters?

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.500
Oh, are you the queen then?

01:01:58.500 --> 01:01:59.500
Hmm?

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.500
I am Mrs. Philly jog.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.500
Now what do you want?

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.500
You're just fulfilling our royal duty bringing soup to the poor.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.500
Giving cheer to those less fortunate that ourselves.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.500
Here my good woman.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.500
Now if you just...

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.500
Oh, there you call me poor.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.500
You who doesn't have a stitch of clothing to your name.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:20.500
Oh, the rich aroma of the soup must have overcome you, Mrs. Philly jog.

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:21.500
Ah!

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.500
Eat it yourself, your majesty.

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.500
Ah!

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.500
This is how I treason.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.500
Send for the guard.

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.500
Take her to the tower.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.500
Hahaha!

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.500
Oh!

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.500
Oh!

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.500
We cannot see.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.500
I'm afraid that serves you right, Snork maiden.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.500
Snork maiden!

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.500
Don't use that common name.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.500
Help us.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:46.500
We cannot see.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.500
Please don't steal.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.500
You're all highness.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.500
Oh, hold a moment.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.500
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.500
I think it's stuck moment.

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.500
Use the handle.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.500
Ah!

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.500
Stop!

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.500
You're hurting me.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.500
I'll get it on.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.500
Out of the way.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.500
Ah!

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.500
Wait a minute.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.500
You can't break that soup, Turin.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.500
It's a family heirloom.

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.500
And you mustn't hit Snork maiden on the head.

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.500
You might hurt her.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.500
Stop fooling around and get this thing off, will you?

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.500
All right.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.500
Oh, poor Snork maiden.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.500
You didn't have to get up that hard.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.500
Difficult to judge it with a broom.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.500
You never hit anyone wearing a scepter in before.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.500
Oh, you will write your royal highness.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.500
Oh, forgive us, your royal highness.

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.500
Sprinkle some cold water over her face.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.500
No, she'd hate that, mama.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.500
Snork maiden.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.500
Oh, it's no good, moment.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:40.500
I don't think she'll wake up to anything, but your royal highness.

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.500
Your highness.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.500
Your highness.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.500
Come out!

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.500
Snork maiden.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.500
Oh, I'm so glad your royal highness is with us again.

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:54.500
I hope your royal highness is not badly hurt.

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.500
Oh.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.500
Where am I?

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.500
In moment, Valley, of course, stupid. Where do you think?

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.500
That's weird.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:06.500
I thought moment and I had gone for a walk in the lonely mountains.

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.500
Didn't we, moment?

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:09.500
Huh?

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.500
Do you remember who I am, Snork maiden?

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:14.500
Moment, what are you talking about, of course I do.

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.500
And you don't think you're a princess anymore?

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.500
Princess?

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.500
Have you gone crazy or something?

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.500
Or what princess?

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.500
What do you mean, moment?

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.500
Hooray!

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.500
She's back to normal.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.500
Snork maiden's back to normal.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.500
Yes, it's nice to have you back again.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.500
Yes, it's wonderful.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.500
Welcome home.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.500
What is?

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.500
What's wonderful?

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.500
Have you all gone loopy or something?

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.500
Never mind, Snork maiden.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.500
You bumped your head, that's all.

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:44.500
And so Snork maiden's brief spell as a royal princess came to an end.

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.500
Except that she was the only one who didn't remember it.

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.500
But everyone else in movement valley breathed a sigh of relief.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:02.500
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:10.500
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:14.500
They're always happy and always at play.

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:21.500
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:25.500
The movements.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:32.500
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:40.500
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.500
They're always happy and always at play.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:50.500
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:54.500
The movements.

01:05:54.500 --> 01:06:00.500
The movements.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:22.500
Here they are for one and all.

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.500
The movements are about to come.

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:28.500
Come on and sit down here with me.

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:31.500
They're for you on your TV.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.500
They are the movements.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.500
They are the movements.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.500
Come with me, give me your hand.

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:43.500
I'll take you up to a movement land.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.500
You can fly just like a bird.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.500
Sing that song ever.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.500
There were the movements.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:54.500
There were the movements.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.500
There were the movements.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.500
There were the movements.

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:03.500
There were the movements.

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:06.500
There were the movements.

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:09.500
There were the movements.

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.500
There were the movements.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:15.500
There were the movements.

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:18.500
There were the movements.

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:21.500
There were the movements.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:24.500
There were the movements.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:28.500
There were the movements.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:32.500
There were the movements.

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:38.500
There were the movements.

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:41.500
There were the movements.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:46.500
There were the movements.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:56.500
With all the planets in outer space, there must be other forms of life different to that on Earth.

01:07:56.500 --> 01:08:01.500
We don't know what they look like because no one from here has ever seen them.

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:13.500
However, we do know that they don't look like this because this is sniffed one of movement's friends.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.500
There were the movements.

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:44.500
There were the movements.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:51.500
There were the movements.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:09:00.500
So, it looks as though the rumor was right.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.500
Oh, what room was that?

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:07.500
That we were about to be invaded by aliens from outer space.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:10.500
Oh, dear, do you mean that thing that was chasing me

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.500
might have been one of them?

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:13.500
Well, yes.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:16.500
I thought they were just after me.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.500
I wouldn't have thought you'd have been that important to them, sniff,

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:22.500
but I suppose you never know, do you?

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:26.500
It says here in this book that aliens from outer space

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:31.500
are very civilized and peace-loving and would never want to invade us.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.500
It seemed as though they're quite happy where they are.

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.500
I do, it's not a very scientific book.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:41.500
Well, it was definitely attacking me, Mom and Papa, I know it was.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:45.500
Well, it might have been a civilization from another planet, sniff.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.500
They were just hungry.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.500
Huh?

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:53.500
Well, the inspector told me that he thought we were being invaded by aliens, and he shouldn't know.

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.500
I'm sure he's exaggerating.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.500
I wonder what they look like.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.500
Why don't you come and help me in the garden?

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.500
You never know, we might see one.

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.500
Mama, wait for me!

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.500
Mama, what's that?

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.500
Well, I would say it's not a vegetable, that's for sure.

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.500
It looks like a flying saucer.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:28.500
I wonder if there are any aliens in it.

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.500
They might be heard, Mama.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.500
Let's have a look.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.500
I think there's something there.

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.500
This looks odd.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.500
I wonder what it is.

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.500
It's a bit like a radio, isn't it?

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.500
Oh yeah, an alien radio.

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:59.500
Do you think there's anyone in there moving?

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.500
Anybody there?

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.500
It seems to have been deserted.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:10.500
There's a funny noise coming from it.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.500
Well, it doesn't look to me like it could fly again.

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.500
It could be repaired.

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.500
You'd need to know about flying saucers.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.500
Papa could do it?

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:25.500
I don't think flying saucers should make that sort of noise.

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.500
Do you, woman?

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:30.500
I don't think so, but I don't know very much about them.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:33.500
It does seem a bit odd, as if they've said it to be blown up

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.500
so that no one would be able to steal it,

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.500
because they want to keep the design a secret.

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.500
Do you think it will?

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.500
Oh!

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:45.500
I'm not sure, Mama, but let's get away in case it does explode.

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:49.500
That's why it's empty, but I wish it hadn't landed in the Asparagus patch.

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.500
I'll take the radio with me.

01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.500
It won't be too long now, Mama.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.500
No, it won't.

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.500
Good morning.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.500
It's vanished.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.500
Less my soul.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:13.500
Papa's book said they could be a very advanced life form.

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:24.500
There's nothing to show it was ever here,

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:28.500
except the hole in the ground, and this radio thing.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.500
Hmm.

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:35.500
Me, is it a radio, Papa?

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.500
I don't know. It looks a bit like one.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:41.500
Let's try pressing one of these buttons.

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:44.500
The red one first, I think.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.500
Oh!

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.500
Papa, where have you gone?

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.500
Well, I'm right here.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.500
No, I wonder what happens if I press this one.

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:10.500
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't see you either, dear.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.500
What?

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:17.500
Oh, I see.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.500
So if you press the red button, you become invisible.

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.500
What a fascinating machine.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.500
Papa, I think I'd rather see you, dear.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.500
Well, of course you would.

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:32.500
Well, then let's try the yellow one.

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.500
Can you see me now?

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.500
No, Papa.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:37.500
Oh, that's odd.

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.500
Do you want me to try, Papa?

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.500
Please, Mama.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.500
There, that's it.

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.500
Oh, Papa.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.500
Oh, that's a very dangerous machine.

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:56.500
I don't want to disappear ever again.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.500
It's not a nice experience.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.500
No, dear. I didn't like you vanishing like that.

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.500
Well, we must put it somewhere safe, Mama,

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.500
where the children can't find it.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.500
Yes, dear.

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:14.500
Mom!

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.500
Snorke made it. What an earth's the matter.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.500
We found a strange creature.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.500
Strange creature?

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.500
I think it's an alien.

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.500
Does it look like a jellyfish?

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.500
No, not at all.

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.500
Little mice keeping an eye on it.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.500
Come on.

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.500
Where are you going, Mum and Papa?

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.500
Going me. Oh, no, Especial.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.500
Mum and Mama, hang on.

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:42.500
I've got a few questions for you.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:45.500
Really, Inspector?

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.500
I was told that a flying saucer

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.500
had landed in your garden,

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.500
but all I can see is a big hole.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:53.500
Where is it?

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.500
What have you done with the saucer?

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:56.500
Nothing.

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:57.500
Well, where is it?

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.500
It's not there now.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.500
It was there, but then it just vanished.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.500
Vanished?

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.500
Yes, that's right.

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:08.500
When you say vanished, you mean it flew away again?

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.500
No, it just went woof.

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.500
Gone.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.500
Moments are it, too.

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.500
That's very odd.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.500
Yes, it was.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.500
Did you see any aliens on board by any chance?

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:20.500
No.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.500
Are you telling me the truth?

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:23.500
Of course.

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.500
Why should I lie to you?

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:26.500
Well, I can't.

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.500
Think of any reason.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.500
I'm sorry, but it's upsetting

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.500
aliens invading Mum and Valley.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.500
Yes, it is. Can we go now?

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.500
Certainly.

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.500
Where are you all going, by the way?

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.500
Oh, only to the beach to collect shells.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.500
See you, Inspector.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.500
Collecting shells indeed,

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:50.500
while I'm hunting for aliens.

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:53.500
Ah! Over here!

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.500
Ah!

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:56.500
Ah!

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:59.500
Ah!

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.500
Ah, ah, you did the thing now.

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.500
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.500
Is that an alien?

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.500
It certainly is, but not like it says in the book.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.500
Have you tried talking to it?

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.340
Yes, but it wouldn't answer.

01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:14.860
Well, let me try.

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:17.980
Are you from outer space?

01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:18.900
Go show Wattley.

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:20.900
Wattley, do I see Dachydachadali nodding?

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:24.980
Yes, it looks like a laugh and laugh a little bit.

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:27.780
It looks like an alien child to me.

01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:29.020
More like a lamp.

01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:29.900
Poor thing.

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:31.260
He must be hungry.

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:32.860
Let's take him home.

01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:35.860
Yeah, well, we don't want the inspector to see him.

01:16:41.500 --> 01:17:01.580
I'm sorry we can't understand you, but I'm sure you'll like milk, even if you don't

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:02.580
speak English.

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:06.580
Just try it and see.

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:09.620
I think he's missing his home.

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:14.140
Wherever in the universe that might be, I wonder where his parents are.

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.620
He can't have come on his own.

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:17.380
He seems far too little for that.

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:18.860
Well, I don't know.

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:23.060
But he's obviously missing them and he seems very unhappy.

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:26.660
Do you think the inspector would really arrest him, Owen Papa?

01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:27.660
Possibly.

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:29.820
He would think it is duty.

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:32.140
Well that would be horrible of him.

01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:33.140
I know.

01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:34.140
It's inspector.

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:40.140
Oh dear, he mustn't find him here.

01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:44.140
And he's got stinky with him.

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:45.140
Oh, stinky.

01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:46.140
Well, that means trouble.

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:47.140
Quick, he can hide in the kitchen.

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.140
We got to do something.

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.140
And quickly.

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:50.140
I know what to do.

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:51.140
What, Mama?

01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:52.140
We'll use the machine.

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:53.140
Oh yeah.

01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:54.140
I know what to do.

01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:55.140
I know what to do.

01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:56.140
What, Mama?

01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:57.140
We'll use the machine.

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:58.140
Oh yeah.

01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.140
I know what to do.

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:00.140
I know what to do.

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:01.140
I know what to do.

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:02.140
I know what to do.

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:12.140
We'll just keep him outside.

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:22.140
Now him, this one, right?

01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:28.140
Oh dear.

01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:31.140
I think they're here!

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:40.140
Oh, moving papa, I heard there was an alien here with what's happening?

01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:46.140
What's happened to me?

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:48.140
Goodness, Inspector, you're very shiny.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:51.140
Oh dear, yes, how very, very strange.

01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:54.140
You look like a great big glow worm.

01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:57.140
An inspector in shining armor, you mean, Little My?

01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:59.140
That's just what I thought.

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:03.140
You'll never need a lamp to be seen, Inspector.

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:04.140
I like it.

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.140
Criminals will be afraid of me.

01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:10.140
I can't wait to get back to the station and show the constables.

01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:12.140
Handy for reading in bed, too.

01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:15.140
Well, duty calls. Bye!

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.140
What are you doing?

01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:28.140
I didn't know that the machine was still working.

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:30.140
Oh, you can speak English.

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:31.140
Of course I can.

01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:34.140
It's just that I need my language converted to help me to translate.

01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:36.140
And if you hadn't taken it from my ship and hidden it,

01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:38.140
I would have been able to talk sooner.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:41.140
That's a good way to learn, isn't it?

01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:42.140
Where are you going?

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:44.140
To see that nice shiny man.

01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:46.140
But he'll arrest you!

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:49.140
He came here looking for you, but he forgot about it

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:51.140
when the machine started him glowing.

01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:55.140
No! Don't go there!

01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:57.140
Hey, why?

01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:59.140
I love that light of shimmer.

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:03.140
It's just like, oh, it makes me feel really safe.

01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:06.140
Hello! Hello, Inspector.

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.140
Yes, what is it?

01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:09.140
Take me with you.

01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:10.140
What?

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:13.140
Well, you're so bright and beautiful Inspector.

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:15.140
Oh, you think so?

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:17.140
Hello, everyone, shimmers like that.

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:18.140
Everyone.

01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:20.140
Well, that must be very nice for them.

01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:22.140
I want to pose you, please.

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:26.140
I'm sorry, I'm too busy, but it was nice talking to you.

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:29.140
You see, the aliens have invaded Moomin Valley

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:31.140
and I must find them.

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:34.140
Oh, I just remembered.

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:38.140
I was tipped off that there was one of them in Moomin House.

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:47.140
The inspector's coming back.

01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:49.140
What about the alien?

01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:50.140
He's running after him.

01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:52.140
Has he been handcuffed, Moomin?

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:54.140
I don't think so.

01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:03.140
Open up in the name of the law, Moomin Papa.

01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:05.140
Well, certainly for you, Inspector.

01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:08.140
Come on in, you're very welcome.

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:11.140
Moomin Papa, I have information from a reliable source,

01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:13.140
well, sort of reliable,

01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:16.140
that you have been hovering a fugitive.

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:18.140
I'm sorry.

01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:22.140
In other words, I believe you have been hiding an alien here.

01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:24.140
Oh, Inspector, I don't think hiding is the right word.

01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:27.140
That suggests we are trying to keep something from you.

01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:28.140
Well, Mama?

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:31.140
Would we do that, Inspector?

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:37.140
Hmm, that stinky is tricked me again.

01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:39.140
Isn't it lucky he didn't find you?

01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:41.140
I want a nice inspector.

01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.140
Look, how many times must I tell you?

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:45.140
He'll lock you up in an nasty cell.

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:47.140
I like him. I want to see him.

01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:49.140
No, don't!

01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:02.140
Perhaps if we press the yellow button, he'll stop sharing.

01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:03.140
Good idea, Papa.

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:04.140
Be quick, Mama.

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:07.140
The yellow button.

01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:08.140
Here goes.

01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:18.140
You don't want him now that he stopped shining.

01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:20.140
Do you, little fella?

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:21.140
No.

01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:23.140
Let's go home, man.

01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:27.140
Moomin Mama, come and look, we've saved the alien.

01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:33.140
Moomin Mama, the inspector's not glowing anymore.

01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:35.140
Isn't that something?

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:36.140
Mama?

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:47.140
Where are you?

01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:48.140
I'm here.

01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:50.140
Where?

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:52.140
Where are you, Mama?

01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:55.140
Well, Mama?

01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:56.140
Right here.

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.140
Mama?

01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:02.140
Oh, no, what's happened to you?

01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:03.140
I don't know.

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:05.140
Probably that machine again.

01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:09.140
Oh, so it shrinks you as well as making you invisible, does it?

01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:10.140
Well, well.

01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:11.140
Oh, dear.

01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:13.140
I need an apron.

01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:16.140
Papa, can you get a handkerchief from my handbag?

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:19.140
You really are quite small.

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:23.140
But you look very cute, of course, Mama.

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:25.140
Would you like to stay like that for a while?

01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:26.140
No, I would not.

01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:29.140
Push another button quickly before anyone sees me.

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:31.140
Go on now, hurry up, Papa.

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.140
Yeah.

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:34.140
Oh, dear.

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:35.140
What's up?

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:38.140
The machine's gone.

01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:40.140
Oh.

01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:43.140
Hey, you.

01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:45.140
Tinky, give me back.

01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:46.140
Hey.

01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:47.140
Papa.

01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:48.140
Don't worry, Mama.

01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:50.140
I'll get it back.

01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:00.140
Oh, look at that way.

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:01.140
Yeah.

01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:03.140
Stop him, Moments.

01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:04.140
Stop him.

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:05.140
He stole the machine.

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:07.140
We'll get him, Papa.

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.140
Hey, sniff!

01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:12.140
Sniff!

01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:14.140
Don't let Stamkey get away!

01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:15.140
Right.

01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:19.140
Inventory!

01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:25.140
Please let me pass, Sniff.

01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:26.140
I'll give you a gold stopper and...

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:27.140
A gold stopper?

01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:28.140
I mean, free.

01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:29.140
No, no, five.

01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:30.140
Five.

01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:31.140
No.

01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:33.140
Give me the machine, Stamkey.

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:41.140
Where is it, Moments?

01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:43.140
What's happened to the machine?

01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:48.140
It's at the bottom of the river, Papa.

01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:51.140
Oh, poor Mama. Poor Mama.

01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:52.140
What's wrong with her?

01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:55.140
She needs the machine to get back to normal.

01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:57.140
Normal?

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:07.140
Well, at least this is a chance to do some really fine embroidery.

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.140
Don't worry, Mama.

01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:12.140
I promise we'll look after you.

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:14.140
It's all right, Moomin.

01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:15.140
I'll manage.

01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:18.140
I'll have to get some smaller pots and pans, though.

01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:21.140
And we'll have to have smaller helpings.

01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:23.140
But that might be a bad idea.

01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.140
Oh.

01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:40.140
Oh.

01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:51.140
Here.

01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:52.140
Here.

01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:53.140
My house.

01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:54.140
Come for me.

01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:56.140
Mama.

01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:57.140
Papa.

01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:11.140
It's like the one we saw in the garden.

01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:36.140
Mama. Papa.

01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:38.540
Mama, oh.

01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:43.140
Oh, wait.

01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:02.640
Impealing.

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.140
They are telling you of aren't they?

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:06.960
I took a flying saucer.

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:11.380
Look, would you ask your parents to make mama a normal size again?

01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:14.880
Yes, of course.

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.540
Fiddler grassly grassy group!

01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:18.740
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.780
Oh, well, that's more like it.

01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:31.820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, dear.

01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:34.380
Oh, oh, oh, no, stop, it's too much.

01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:37.580
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry, but could you try again, please?

01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:39.580
I know, but the more a mama there is, the better,

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:42.220
but you're getting very large, very large indeed.

01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.220
You need to go.

01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:45.380
Uh-oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:46.420
Oh.

01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:05.380
So Mumen Valley hadn't really been invaded at all,

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:07.300
and the movements and the friends that found out

01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:09.140
where aliens really looked like.

01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:20.140
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.

01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:28.140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:32.140
They're always happy, and always at play.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:38.140
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:50.140
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.

01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:57.140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:01.140
They're always happy, and always at play.

01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:07.140
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:12.140
The movements.

01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:18.140
The movements.

01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:40.140
Here they are for one and all.

01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:46.140
The movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:51.140
They're for you on your TV, they are the movements.

01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:54.140
They are the movements.

01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:57.140
So come with me, give me your hand.

01:29:57.140 --> 01:30:00.140
I'll take you up to a moment land.

01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:05.140
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever.

01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:08.140
There were the movements.

01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:11.140
There were the movements.

01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:14.140
There were the movements.

01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:19.140
There were the movements.

01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:24.140
There were the movements.

01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:29.140
There were the movements.

01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:34.140
There were the movements.

01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:39.140
There were the movements.

01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:44.140
There were the movements.

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:49.140
There were the movements.

01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:57.140
There were the movements.

01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:19.140
The movements.

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:27.140
The movements.

01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:34.140
Mumen Valley is enjoying another still peaceful summer's day.

01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:38.140
However, this lazy lifestyle, no matter how pleasant it might be,

01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:43.140
does not suit everyone.

01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:45.140
Yes.

01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:48.140
Would you like a cup of coffee, dear?

01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:51.140
Yes, I think I need one, Mama.

01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:54.140
Oh, dear, is it your memoirs?

01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:55.140
I'm stuck.

01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:57.140
Ah, can I help?

01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:59.140
How can I create in this?

01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:00.140
In what?

01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:02.140
In this sleepy atmosphere.

01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:04.140
I've also come to a boring part.

01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:05.140
When was that?

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:07.140
The time I wrote poems.

01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:10.140
Were they any good?

01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:11.140
No.

01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:14.140
Well, miss that bit out then.

01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:15.140
I can't.

01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:18.140
I must put it down for posterity.

01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:20.140
It is my duty.

01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:23.140
But how can I get inspiration here in this place

01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:26.140
when nothing ever happens, nothing ever happens at all?

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:30.140
Oh, I think this means another adventure.

01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:36.140
Yes, Mama, but I need it to be big, exciting, and frightening.

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:40.140
Mama, what's the matter?

01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:41.140
Are you all right?

01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:44.140
Your father says that because nothing ever happens here,

01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.140
he can't write.

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:48.140
So I'm looking for an adventure for him.

01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:49.140
Can you think of anything?

01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:52.140
He wants it to be big, exciting, and frightening.

01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:54.140
Does he want something really exciting?

01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:55.140
Yes, dear.

01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:57.140
I'm afraid so.

01:32:57.140 --> 01:33:00.140
I think I could manage that.

01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:12.140
That looks like the footprint of a huge monster.

01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:26.140
Oh, it's a good feeling giving others a bit of excitement.

01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:35.140
Just a couple more.

01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:41.140
I'm praised.

01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:45.140
The booboo I don't have to do modest work very often.

01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:50.140
Phew, that was harder than I thought.

01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:54.140
Oi, sleepy hands.

01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:56.140
Wake up, everybody.

01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:59.140
Mom and Papa, quickly get up.

01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:01.140
Mom and Mama, a monster.

01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:04.140
You've been visited by a monster.

01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:06.140
Wake up before you eat and alive.

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:09.140
Come on, hurry, hurry.

01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:13.140
I want huge tracks.

01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:18.140
That should keep them guessing for a while.

01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:23.140
Hmm, it could be a monster from the depths of the ocean.

01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:25.140
Something's not right here.

01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:28.140
Don't you think it's a bit odd that it came directly to Moome House?

01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:30.140
Well, look at the footsteps.

01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:32.140
They go in a straight line.

01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:38.140
Someone must have told it to go to Moome House.

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:40.140
And they're only going one way.

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:43.140
Look, there are tiny footsteps going back to the sea.

01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:46.140
Oh, Mama, the monster must still be here then.

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:49.140
Oh, well, not necessarily.

01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:52.140
Retracing one's own footsteps is the sign of an advanced intelligence.

01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:55.140
Stepping back exactly the way you came.

01:34:55.140 --> 01:34:58.140
The tough question is, why would the monster do that?

01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:02.140
One is led to believe that it wants us to think it's still here.

01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:06.140
Well, in fact, it has gone back to wherever it came from.

01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:09.140
Fatal battle is my dear mother, would say.

01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:12.140
But why would it want us to think that, Papa?

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.140
It's a spy.

01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:15.140
Oh, it's a spy.

01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:16.140
Something it shouldn't.

01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:20.140
It'd hardly be a good spy if we knew they have to sneak in and out.

01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:22.140
I think it's still here.

01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:23.140
I can feel it.

01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:25.140
You know what I mean?

01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:27.140
Perhaps tonight.

01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:29.140
Tonight?

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:30.140
What about tonight?

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:31.140
That's when they'll attack.

01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:33.140
It's gone back to give its report.

01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:35.140
How do you know that, Papa?

01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:40.140
Well, obviously, that's why it still wants us to believe it's here.

01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:41.140
Mama!

01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:42.140
Yes, what is it, Moome?

01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:44.140
Something terrible is going to happen.

01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:47.140
A monster is going to attack us tonight.

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:49.140
And Papa's excited about it.

01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:50.140
Oh, good.

01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:52.140
That's nice for him.

01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:55.140
Hurry, everyone.

01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:58.140
I expect the monster will be here soon.

01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:04.140
Oh, poor.

01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:07.140
Now hold it still.

01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:11.140
This is going to be a good barricade, don't you think?

01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:14.140
We'd better make sure it's big enough.

01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:18.140
It's hardly any fun at all playing tricks on them.

01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:20.140
They're so gullible!

01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:25.140
If we catch the monster, we can sell it to a zoo.

01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:28.140
I'll handle the sale, of course.

01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:31.140
I'd rather tame it and keep it as a pet.

01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:35.140
Well, you could ride on it to go pigneking.

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:40.140
Oh, no, no.

01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:52.140
All right, now for the moat.

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:53.140
Here we go.

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:56.140
I hope the well's got enough water in it.

01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:00.140
It'll be able to swim in this, Papa.

01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:04.140
Yes, it'll remind you to the sea and keep it calm.

01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:06.140
This is fresh water, Papa.

01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:08.140
We'd better put some salt in it.

01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:10.140
Good idea, Moome.

01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:13.140
We'll plant some seaweed and put some rocks in too,

01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:15.140
and then it'll feel really at home.

01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:23.140
I wonder when it'll come.

01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:27.140
I don't know, but I can feel in my bones it'll be tonight.

01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:29.140
And we keep watching till it comes?

01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:31.140
Of course we will, constantly.

01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:35.140
What if it doesn't come until tomorrow night or the night after that?

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:40.140
It might be a long wait, so we'll take it in turns and remember everybody.

01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:44.140
The safety of Moome in Valley relies upon our vigilance.

01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:46.140
We must be ready.

01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:50.140
Huh?

01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:07.140
Look at what those fools have done.

01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:09.140
It was worth all the trouble.

01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:14.140
Huh?

01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:17.140
Look, they put down food as bait.

01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:19.140
Moome and Papa must be worn out.

01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:22.140
Well, I'll take the food anyway.

01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:23.140
Carefully, does it?

01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:25.140
Don't want to wake up the guard.

01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:27.140
And this is great.

01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:33.140
I've managed to play a really good trick on the stupid moments,

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:36.140
and they've given me a slap-up meal as well.

01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:38.140
Ah!

01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:42.140
Well, well, what's that?

01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:44.140
The monster's here.

01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:45.140
Shut the gate.

01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:49.140
Ah, there's the rope. Quickly.

01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:52.140
No, no.

01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:54.140
Stop it, stop it, everybody.

01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:55.140
To wash.

01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:00.140
No, it's only me.

01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:02.140
Make room. I'll get it.

01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:03.140
Oh, what is it?

01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:04.140
Oh, what is it?

01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:06.140
There's no monster only me.

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:09.140
Please, it's me. It's me, Stinky.

01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:10.140
Stinky?

01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:12.140
Well, it sounds like Stinky.

01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:14.140
Be careful, everybody. It's a baby monster.

01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:17.140
Another monster, please help me.

01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:19.140
I made the footprints.

01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:22.140
You did. He's obviously lying. He's too small.

01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:24.140
Watch him, or he'll go get his daddy.

01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:26.140
No, please, I beg you.

01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:28.140
Ah, Moome and Papa.

01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:30.140
Oh, hello, Snuffkin.

01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:32.140
Why don't you let Stinky go? It really is him, you know.

01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:34.140
It is?

01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:37.140
Yes, it was Stinky.

01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:39.140
And he really did make those footprints.

01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:41.140
How do you know that, Snuffkin?

01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:46.140
I was fishing off the shore last night when I saw him digging the holes.

01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:49.140
The little rascal was at it for hours and hours.

01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:05.140
Why don't you come inside, Stinky?

01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:06.140
This is great.

01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:09.140
It was very good of you to make the footprints.

01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:11.140
Papa hasn't had so much fun at ages.

01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:15.140
I'm glad it was hard work and I lost all my hair, too.

01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:18.140
Well, mischief isn't always easy, you know.

01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:21.140
You can say that again. This is delicious.

01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:35.140
Papa!

01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:53.140
Papa, are you all right?

01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:55.140
Yes, thank you, Moome.

01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:04.140
Mama.

01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:05.140
Yes, dear?

01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:08.140
Shh, I've got something important to tell you.

01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:09.140
What is it, Papa?

01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:12.140
A secret in my mind is made up.

01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:13.140
Of course, dear.

01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:15.140
I'm going to run away on an adventure trip.

01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:17.140
That's nice for you.

01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:20.140
It's a trip without a destination full of mystery,

01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:23.140
hazards and hardships and you're coming to, Mama.

01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:25.140
Oh, splendid.

01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:28.140
Shall we take all the children or just move in?

01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:31.140
No, no children.

01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:34.140
That would be the same as here, only somewhere else.

01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:35.140
We'll run away.

01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:37.140
Run away, Moome and Papa?

01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:39.140
I'll be an adventurer again,

01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:41.140
just as I was in my lost youth.

01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:44.140
And with you by my side, we'll have adventure romance.

01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:47.140
All we desire, the sun, the stars.

01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:50.140
But what about Moome? He'll be frantic.

01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:53.140
Whoa, then it's time he learned to stand on his own feet.

01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:55.140
Fan for himself. Become a man.

01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:57.140
We can't protect him forever, you know.

01:41:57.140 --> 01:42:00.140
He's big enough to be left by himself.

01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:11.140
I'm on, Mama.

01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:15.140
Oh, just a moment, Papa.

01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:18.140
You can't take anything more with us.

01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:22.140
No, I know, but I forgot to write down where the sugar is.

01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:26.140
If they can't find it, they'll just have to do without.

01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:28.140
But then they won't be able to make cakes,

01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:30.140
and the tea will taste awful.

01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:32.140
Oh, and they'll never find this cinnamon on them.

01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:34.140
Where shall I leave it?

01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:37.140
Goodness, Mama, cinnamon, I ask you,

01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:40.140
when the unknown is calling to us.

01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:43.140
I should have gone on my own, indeed, I should.

01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:45.140
But then what good as an adventure, when you can't say who?

01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:47.140
That was a close shave to someone after us.

01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:49.140
Is there anything wrong, Papa?

01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:53.140
No, everything is fine, but we must leave before dawn.

01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:55.140
All right.

01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:57.140
We have a long way to go.

01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:59.140
How far and where?

01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:01.140
It's very dark, you know.

01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:02.140
Yes, isn't it?

01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:05.140
We'll just follow our feet, and they say this way.

01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:16.140
Oh, God.

01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:21.140
Good morning, Mama.

01:43:22.140 --> 01:43:24.140
Mama, where are you?

01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:27.140
What's the matter, Moomin?

01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:29.140
My parents are missing.

01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:30.140
Are you sure?

01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:32.140
Of course, I'm sure.

01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:34.140
That's a bit of a problem, I'm getting hungry.

01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:35.140
I need my breakfast.

01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:37.140
I have to start the day with a good meal.

01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:38.140
I'm starving.

01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:40.140
Me, too.

01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:44.140
I'm starving.

01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:45.140
I'm starving.

01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:46.140
I'm starving.

01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:47.140
I'm starving.

01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:48.140
I'm starving.

01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:50.140
I'm starving.

01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:51.140
I'm starving.

01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:53.140
I'm starving.

01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:56.140
Don't worry, Moomin.

01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:59.140
I'm sure that Moomin, Mama and Moomin, Papa

01:43:59.140 --> 01:44:01.140
will be back home very soon.

01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:03.140
But where could they have gone to, Snuffkin?

01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:04.140
No idea.

01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:06.140
Have they left a note?

01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:08.140
Have you had your breakfast yet, Moomin?

01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:10.140
No, nothing.

01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:12.140
It's not the shame without Mama.

01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:14.140
Cheer up, Moomin.

01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:16.140
You can have this fish.

01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:20.140
And I'll come up to Moomin House and cook it especially for you, if you like.

01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:22.140
Thanks, Snuffkin.

01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:24.140
But there are two cooks there already.

01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:27.140
Little May and Snuff are both trying to cook.

01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:29.140
A bit of this, a bit of that.

01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:31.140
This is great.

01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:35.140
There's lots of delicious things I want to try out.

01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:38.140
Where are we, Papa?

01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:40.140
No idea, Mama.

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:43.140
Too dark to see anything at all.

01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:45.140
We've been gone for hours.

01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:48.140
I think it should have been light by now.

01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:51.140
Oh dear, we have to face it.

01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:52.140
I'm afraid we're lost.

01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:54.140
I'm sorry, Mama, but there it is.

01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:56.140
Oh, what do you mean?

01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:59.140
Well, in the dark, we must have wandered into some caves.

01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:01.140
Who knows how many different tunnels we took.

01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:04.140
It could be weeks before we find our way.

01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:12.140
Little May, it's burning.

01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:13.140
Mind your own business.

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:15.140
I might like burnt food.

01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:16.140
It's very nutritious.

01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:17.140
Watch your own cooking.

01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:20.140
Couldn't be any worse than the last lot you made for us.

01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:21.140
Ha!

01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:22.140
I wonder where Moomin is.

01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:23.140
He likes my food.

01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:24.140
I'll get him to try it.

01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:26.140
He can try mine first.

01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:28.140
Now that I've practiced, it'll be perfect.

01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:31.140
Oh man, I've done something for you!

01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:43.140
Ah!

01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:49.140
Mama!

01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:02.140
Mama!

01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:05.140
Mama!

01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:20.140
Mama!

01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:30.140
What was that?

01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:40.140
Mom and Papa, wake up!

01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:43.140
Mom and Papa?

01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:50.140
Mom and Papa, wake up!

01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:05.140
Ooh!

01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:11.140
It tastes brackish.

01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:13.140
We must be quite near the sea.

01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:19.140
Mama!

01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:39.140
That's a big one.

01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:44.140
Gotcha!

01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:49.140
Moomin!

01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:50.140
Moomin!

01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:52.140
Where are you so far from home?

01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:53.140
Mama!

01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:54.140
At last!

01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:56.140
Look, I've got a big fish!

01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:58.140
Come and help me quickly!

01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:00.140
Don't let it get away!

01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:12.140
I've never seen such a big fish moving!

01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:14.140
Just wait till Papa sees it!

01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:17.140
Oh yes, Moomin Papa.

01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:18.140
This looks familiar.

01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:20.140
It's Moomin Falley, isn't it?

01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:23.140
Of course it is, just outside the cave.

01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:24.140
Oh dear.

01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:27.140
I'm afraid that your father will be a bit disappointed.

01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:28.140
Where is he then?

01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:29.140
Well...

01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:34.140
He's gone, looking for adventure.

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:35.140
Adventure?

01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:36.140
Where?

01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:37.140
I don't really know.

01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:38.140
Somewhere.

01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:40.140
I could have gone with him.

01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:42.140
When's he coming home?

01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:45.140
I'm afraid I don't know that either.

01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:48.140
You know Papa tonight, tomorrow night.

01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:50.140
Next Christmas.

01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:53.140
Your guess is as good as mine, Moomin.

01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:54.140
Wow!

01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:57.140
I bet he's having a great adventure right now!

01:48:57.140 --> 01:48:58.140
Hey, Mama!

01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:11.140
Mama!

01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:15.140
Hello, where are you?

01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:17.140
Oh.

01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:20.140
Oh, the cave dwellers must have her.

01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:22.140
Oh.

01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:23.140
Mama.

01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:32.140
Mama!

01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:33.140
Mama!

01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:34.140
Oh!

01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:36.140
Can you hear me?

01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:37.140
Oh!

01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:45.140
Goodness, the sea.

01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:57.140
Oh, this looks like...

01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:59.140
Oh, it gets...

01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:01.140
Oh, dear.

01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:07.140
Terry, me, I don't...

01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:10.140
Oh, well...

01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:12.140
Oh, my...

01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:14.140
Oh, you see?

01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:16.140
In my video...

01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:18.140
Here, this is it.

01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:20.140
Oh, yeah!

01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:21.140
Of course!

01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:23.140
Helio, me.

01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:33.140
Oh, look! Look! It's Papa!

01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:36.140
Papa's back, everyone!

01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:37.140
Uh-huh.

01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:39.140
Hi, Papa!

01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:42.140
Oh.

01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:45.140
Well, I'm back.

01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:47.140
I'm so pleased to see you again.

01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:49.140
Thank you, Mama.

01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:52.140
Papa, how was your adventure?

01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:54.140
I'm unexpected.

01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:55.140
Yes, that's what I'd say.

01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:57.140
Unexpected. Any food.

01:50:57.140 --> 01:50:59.140
Oh, yes. You can try mine.

01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:00.140
First, Moomin, Papa.

01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:02.140
Oh, mine's the best. Try mine, Papa.

01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:04.140
Oh, that's good. I'm starving.

01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:06.140
Tell us about your adventure.

01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:08.140
I love you.

01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:11.140
Were you an immortal danger? Did you eat any rats?

01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:12.140
Yeah, I am.

01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:13.140
Suppose there's adventure.

01:51:13.140 --> 01:51:16.140
I don't think Papa wants to talk about his adventure yet.

01:51:16.140 --> 01:51:18.140
Maybe later.

01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:21.140
And that was the end of Mama and Papa's adventure.

01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:23.140
They didn't get far, but then...

01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:26.140
You don't have to sometimes for things to happen.

01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:29.140
Or at least for you to think they're happening.

01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:39.140
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:47.140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:51.140
They're always happy and always at play.

01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:58.140
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

01:51:58.140 --> 01:52:08.140
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:16.140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:52:16.140 --> 01:52:20.140
They're always happy and always at play.

01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:27.140
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:31.140
The movements.

01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:37.140
The movements.

01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:43.140
The movements.

01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:13.140
The movements.

01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:17.140
The movements.

01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:21.140
The movements.

01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:27.140
The movements.

01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:31.140
The movements.

01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:35.140
The movements.

01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:39.140
The movements.

01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:43.140
The movements.

01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:47.140
The movements.

01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:53.140
The movements.

01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:57.140
The movements.

01:53:57.140 --> 01:54:01.140
The movements.

01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:05.140
The movements.

01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:15.140
The movements.

01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:31.140
It was the end of summer, but still every day seemed harder than the last.

01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:33.140
It was the end of telescending for the last.

01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:37.140
Womenbowl had no rain for weeks and finally the river had dried up.

01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:41.140
Dad says this weather is a catastrophe snuffing.

01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:43.140
Oh no, ready.

01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:45.140
But it is.

01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:47.140
He says this mountain valley will turn into a desert if it carries on.

01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:49.140
I don't think that will happen.

01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:52.140
Dad can't ever remember it so hot.

01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:54.140
Even the river has dried up.

01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:56.140
No, that does worry me.

01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:58.140
I can't fish anymore.

01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:02.260
When all my travels, I found that droughts like this are always followed by a real heavy

01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:03.260
downpour.

01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:10.500
Well, it's too hot for me anyway.

01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:23.620
Oh, it's so hot, I can't think.

01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:52.220
Well, well, even the weeds are wilting.

01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:54.500
The sea never dries up, does it?

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:57.220
Of course not stupid, wherever the fish go.

01:55:57.220 --> 01:56:02.220
I'm going swimming.

01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:31.500
Here you are.

01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:44.540
It's loose.

01:56:44.540 --> 01:57:14.540
I'm going to have to go back to my old house, but I'm not going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house,

01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:22.280
Look at this.

01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:32.360
Like a tile, like a tile.

01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:42.360
Oh, that hurt. What's this stupid box doing here? I think it's floated from foreign lands.

01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:47.360
What's it got in it? Perhaps it's full of priceless jewels.

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:50.360
No, it wouldn't float so high in the water if it was.

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:55.360
A tiara packed in wood shavings. I could use a new comb, too.

01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:58.360
What have you found you, too, a treasure?

01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:02.360
No, we don't think so. It's not heavy enough. But you never know, Snork Maiden.

01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:04.360
Let's open it and see.

01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:07.360
Come on, Slay's. Push me a shore.

01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.360
Perhaps it's gold nuggets in here. Our diamonds are something to eat.

01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:30.360
What is this?

01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:33.360
Seeds, maybe.

01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:34.360
What sort of seeds?

01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:42.360
Hmm. Well, at first glance, I'd say they might be tropical plants.

01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:43.360
Oh, really, Mr. Hemie.

01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:45.360
What plants are tropical?

01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:47.360
Well, species like banana are mangoes.

01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:50.360
Banana? And mangoes.

01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:56.360
Well, I haven't done a lot of research on tropical plants, so I can't be sure, but they do look like it.

01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:59.360
I know, Mama. Why don't we plant them?

01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:00.360
Good idea, Moomin.

01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:05.360
The thing is, we don't have a tropical climate. I'm afraid they wouldn't grow here at all.

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:07.360
Let's plant them, shall we?

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:10.360
They won't bear any fruit, so don't get too excited.

01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:14.360
Oh, well, it seems tropical enough to me, Mr. Hemie.

01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:16.360
At least we can try, can't we?

01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:19.360
I want to see what papaya looks like and ugly fruit.

01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:22.360
I want mangoes growing all around my bedroom window.

01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:24.360
Let's plant them, shall we?

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:32.360
I tell you, they're strictly tropical. They won't take root at all.

01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:57.360
It certainly seems that Mama is enjoying herself, Mr. Hemie.

01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:59.360
I don't think it'll be much use.

01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:03.360
Perhaps not, but it's so worth the farm and trying.

02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:07.360
Imagine Moomin Valley, a tropical jungle.

02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:13.360
Oh, Mr. Hemie, do you think these seeds will grow into real fruit trees?

02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:23.360
Let me see. What have you got here, little my? I could very well be mistaken, but I think this one is a mango seed.

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:25.360
Thanks.

02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:28.360
And why do you want to know, little my?

02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:35.360
Because I'm only growing fruit. I want to be sure I'm not planting stupid orchids or passion flowers or something.

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:43.360
Mr. Hemie, can you tell me which one of these is banana?

02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:46.360
I'm not really too sure, but I think it's this one.

02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:49.360
You want to grow an orchid too, snorkemaiden?

02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:55.360
No, I just want to plant a banana tree in a really special place. It's Moomin's favorite fruit.

02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:03.360
I think she'll be disappointed bananas won't grow here.

02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:10.360
This weather doesn't belong here either. If it gets any hotter, I'll melt. I can't wait for dusk so it'll cool down a bit.

02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:25.360
Isn't it wonderful to go to sleep looking at the stars?

02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:28.360
And it's not so hot anymore.

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:30.360
I'll sleep like a log tonight.

02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:33.360
You always do, don't you, little my?

02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:36.360
Well, sleep like an extra heavy log, then.

02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:46.360
Snorkemaiden, why don't you sleep under that tree with Moomin and little my?

02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:51.360
Oh, because I can't see the stars from there and it makes me feel romantic looking at them.

02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:55.360
But you're going to get very wet if it starts raining in the night.

02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:57.360
You're joking, surely, Mama.

02:01:57.360 --> 02:01:59.360
Not at all.

02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:04.360
But it hasn't rained for ages, and there aren't any clouds or anything. Just stars.

02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:08.360
All the toothpicks fell on the floor, and that's a sure sign of rain.

02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:12.360
Snorkemaiden won't mind if she gets all wet, Moomin, Mama. That should be happy.

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:15.360
Who? Why is that?

02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:21.360
Because then she'll know that the special tree will start growing, and that's very important to her.

02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:27.360
That's true. Good night, everyone. I hope you sleep well.

02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:37.360
Good night, everybody.

02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:48.360
Good night, Moomin.

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:50.360
Good night, don't snore.

02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:08.360
It's too hot to sleep.

02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:12.360
Why don't you sleep outside like the children?

02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:14.360
I think I will.

02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:26.360
A thunderstorm.

02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:29.360
I told you the toothpicks are never wrong.

02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:39.360
Oh!

02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:41.360
Hey, it's raining, Moomin!

02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:44.360
Wake up, Moomin!

02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:46.360
Oh, is it morning?

02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:48.360
The sun's really bright.

02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:50.360
No, it's raining.

02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:52.360
Rainy?

02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:54.360
Look at that.

02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:57.360
You look, I'm getting wet, I'm going inside.

02:03:57.360 --> 02:03:59.360
So Mama was right about the rain.

02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:02.360
Hey, Snorkemaiden!

02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:04.360
Doesn't she look sweet?

02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:06.360
Snorkemaiden!

02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:07.360
Is it raining?

02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:08.360
That's very clever.

02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:11.360
Your mother knows everything doesn't she?

02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:12.360
She does.

02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:14.360
Now let's get into the house.

02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:17.360
Not yet. I want to feel the rain on my face.

02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:19.360
It's been so long.

02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:23.360
Ah!

02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:26.360
Do you want to feel it much longer?

02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:13.360
Oh!

02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:15.360
It's the raining.

02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:23.360
Mangoes!

02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:25.360
That's impossible!

02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:27.360
Gosh!

02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:31.360
By my tail, a jungle!

02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:33.360
That's a tropical jungle!

02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:34.360
Wake up!

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:36.360
Wake up, you two!

02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:38.360
There's a jungle outside!

02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:40.360
We've planted a jungle!

02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:41.360
A jungle?

02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:07.360
Your right moment, those seeds have not only sprouted.

02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:09.360
I know, they're big trees.

02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:12.360
I've never known trees to grow like that.

02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:13.360
That's...

02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:15.360
I think I'll go and play Tarzan.

02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:20.360
I wish my lettuce seeds would do that moment, Papa.

02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:22.360
There's magic here somewhere, Mama.

02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:24.360
Let's go and explore.

02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:30.360
That's rain drumming on the campus.

02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:36.360
It must be.

02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:38.360
Snuffkin!

02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:45.360
What a nurse all this!

02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:49.360
Well, we found a crate of tropical seeds and planted them last night.

02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:52.360
And this morning, while you can see it's like magic.

02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:54.360
It's fantastic.

02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:57.360
I know. We can go on a safari.

02:06:58.360 --> 02:07:00.360
I've seen nothing like it.

02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:08.360
What kind of flower is this?

02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:10.360
It looks like an orchid to me.

02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:13.360
This is a real tropical jungle, isn't it, Snuffkin?

02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:14.360
Not quite.

02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:15.360
What do you mean?

02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:19.360
Well, Moomin, a real jungle would have wild animals in it, wouldn't it?

02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:21.360
Oh, yeah, like tigers and snakes.

02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:26.360
This is more of a tropical botanical garden, I suppose.

02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:30.360
That's Moomin's little mind.

02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:32.360
He can have the peel.

02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:43.360
This is a life.

02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:48.360
Stop, little mind.

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:50.360
Well, well.

02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:55.360
What are you looking for, dear?

02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:57.360
My solar topi.

02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.360
You what?

02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:01.360
My sun helmet, I can't go into the jungle without it.

02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:03.360
I didn't know you had one.

02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:06.360
I used it for a fancy dress party once, I know.

02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:08.360
I put it in a box somewhere.

02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:10.360
Oh, here it is.

02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:12.360
Very dashing, dear.

02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:13.360
I thought so too.

02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:15.360
Oh, I know.

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:23.360
Oh!

02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:25.360
Oh!

02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:34.360
Splendid protection is hat.

02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:41.360
Papa?

02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:43.360
What in earth are you doing?

02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:46.360
I want to get into the cello.

02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:47.360
What for?

02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:49.360
To get my gun.

02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:50.360
Your gun?

02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:54.360
Only fools venture into the jungle without a proper gun.

02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:56.360
I don't think you need a gun, Papa.

02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:58.360
And why not?

02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:00.360
Because there aren't any wild animals.

02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:04.360
Well, one of the seas might have been an egg or something.

02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.360
Look at these, for instance.

02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:08.360
They look very animal.

02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:12.360
Very odd animals.

02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:14.360
More of an odd plant, I think.

02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:15.360
I'd stay away from them.

02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:17.360
They could be very dangerous.

02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:19.360
Look, they've got eyes.

02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:21.360
I think they're man-eating plants.

02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:23.360
Man-eating.

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:25.360
Hey, stop that.

02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:27.360
Stop that.

02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:29.360
Help!

02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:31.360
They're trying to eat me.

02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:33.360
But they want to feed me to that young.

02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, help me.

02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:37.360
Help!

02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:39.360
They're tearing my tail up.

02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:43.360
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:45.360
Oh, no, oh, dear.

02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:47.360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:54.200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:55.200
Oh, oh.

02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:56.400
Uh-oh.

02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:00.840
Well, done, my little Maya just saved my life.

02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:03.160
Well, I saved your tail anyway.

02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:04.880
Oh, oh.

02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:05.880
Huh.

02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:08.540
Look, oh, oh.

02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:11.540
Get something to jam this door shut.

02:10:11.540 --> 02:10:12.540
Come on.

02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:13.520
Hurry.

02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:16.340
Oh, oh.

02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:18.340
I don't know. You can't hold on to much longer.

02:10:36.340 --> 02:10:38.340
That should keep them in now, shouldn't it?

02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:41.340
Well, I don't think they could push their way through that lot.

02:10:41.340 --> 02:10:43.340
They had a very strong grip on my tail.

02:10:43.340 --> 02:10:45.340
He mustn't underestimate them.

02:10:45.340 --> 02:10:46.340
Anything wrong?

02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:49.340
You bet the seller's full of man-eating plants

02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:51.340
trying to gobble up moment papa.

02:10:51.340 --> 02:10:54.340
Oh, my goodness.

02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:55.340
What's the matter?

02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:58.340
You can get straight from the seller into the kitchen.

02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:01.340
What? Oh, no, mama.

02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:02.340
Oh.

02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:17.340
Oh, hello.

02:11:17.340 --> 02:11:19.340
Cue, we got here just in time.

02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:22.340
Whatever's the matter with you, are you all playing Tarzan?

02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:23.340
Oh, no, mama.

02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:27.340
I'm making grandmas if you ever get a tropical fruit recipe.

02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:30.340
And perhaps now it's rained I can wash this dirty floor.

02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:39.340
Ah, by the great bumble, I don't believe this a tropical rainforest.

02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:44.340
Ah, ah, a transcendentia, megaloids.

02:11:44.340 --> 02:11:47.340
And yes, a dyspepsia, flora, and munda.

02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:52.340
Goodness me, I can collect a whole tropical hermoreum right here in Mum and Valley.

02:11:52.340 --> 02:11:56.340
I travel. That's what I need. I'll get one from the Mormons.

02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:06.340
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

02:12:06.340 --> 02:12:08.340
Must say they're not the tiniest family.

02:12:08.340 --> 02:12:11.340
I'll have to move this.

02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:14.340
Oh, this old furniture.

02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:28.340
Do I look that funny?

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:29.340
No, you look great.

02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:32.340
Maybe you and Tarzan have different muscles.

02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:34.340
Me, Tarzan.

02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:35.340
You, Jay.

02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:36.340
Oh, oh.

02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:38.340
Oh, here we go.

02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:40.340
Me, get out with Army Six.

02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:43.340
Ah!

02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:44.340
Ah, help!

02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:47.340
I've got man-eating plants after this.

02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:49.340
What? They must have come out.

02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:51.340
Oh.

02:12:55.340 --> 02:12:57.340
Uh-oh.

02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:03.340
They were in the cellar.

02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:05.340
Did you open the door, Mr. Hamilon?

02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:08.340
Well, yes, I wanted to borrow a trowel.

02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:11.340
Mr. Hamilon, you know all about plants.

02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:13.340
Do you have any idea how we can get rid of them?

02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:15.340
They're man-eaters, you know?

02:13:15.340 --> 02:13:17.340
Can't rid of them.

02:13:17.340 --> 02:13:19.340
Well, let's see.

02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:21.340
We are in a bit of a fix.

02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:24.340
I have heard that they have react to music.

02:13:24.340 --> 02:13:25.340
Music.

02:13:26.340 --> 02:13:27.340
Music.

02:13:27.340 --> 02:13:30.340
Snuffkin, you could play your harmonica.

02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:31.340
Hmm.

02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:50.340
Look, they've started dancing.

02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:52.340
Keep it up, Snuffkin.

02:13:55.340 --> 02:13:56.340
Hmm.

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:11.340
What will they do if he stops playing?

02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:13.340
I really don't know.

02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:21.340
Oh, that's this.

02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:22.340
Oh.

02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:27.340
Oh.

02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:35.340
They're rather sweet when they don't try to eat you.

02:14:35.340 --> 02:14:38.340
And that was how a tropical jungle grew

02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:41.340
and surrounded movement house in one night.

02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:42.340
Is it going to stay?

02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:44.340
And for how long?

02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:50.340
And what will the man-eating plants do if Snuffkin stops playing?

02:14:51.340 --> 02:14:59.340
They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.

02:14:59.340 --> 02:15:06.340
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:10.340
They're always happy and always at play.

02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:14.340
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:21.340
They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.

02:15:21.340 --> 02:15:28.340
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:15:28.340 --> 02:15:32.340
They're always happy and always at play.

02:15:32.340 --> 02:15:37.340
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:15:37.340 --> 02:15:40.340
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:15:40.340 --> 02:15:44.340
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:47.340
The movements.

02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:51.340
The movements.

02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:57.340
The movements.

02:16:10.340 --> 02:16:19.340
Here they are for one and all.

02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:22.340
The movements are about to come.

02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:25.340
Come on and sit down here with me.

02:16:25.340 --> 02:16:27.340
They're here for you on your TV.

02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:30.340
They are the movements.

02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:33.340
They are the movements.

02:16:33.340 --> 02:16:36.340
So come with me, give me your hand.

02:16:36.340 --> 02:16:39.340
I'll take you up to a movement land.

02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:42.340
You can fly just like a bird.

02:16:42.340 --> 02:16:44.340
Sing that song ever.

02:16:44.340 --> 02:16:47.340
There were the movements.

02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:50.340
There were the movements.

02:16:50.340 --> 02:16:53.340
There were the movements.

02:16:53.340 --> 02:16:56.340
There were the movements.

02:16:56.340 --> 02:16:59.340
There were the movements.

02:16:59.340 --> 02:17:02.340
There were the movements.

02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:39.340
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

02:17:39.340 --> 02:18:09.340
The seeds that movement and his friends had found in a box that had been cast up on the beach had grown into a tropical forest. It was beautiful, but also dangerous, with man-eating plants kept at bay by snuffkin playing his harmonica. But for how long?

02:18:09.340 --> 02:18:27.340
Oh dear. Oh! Snuffkin, don't stop playing your harmonica whatever you do or did they'll only get angry and attack us all over again. If I don't stop soon, I might never want to play again.

02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:38.340
Well, perhaps the music has made them more friendly. Be careful, Mr. Himmelon. Oh, don't worry.

02:18:38.340 --> 02:18:48.340
Mr. Himmelon, look out!

02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:58.340
Huh? Ah, ah, ah! I warn him. I don't think the quickly snuffkin' play again.

02:18:58.340 --> 02:18:59.340
Ah!

02:19:01.340 --> 02:19:02.340
Ah!

02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:03.340
Ah!

02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:04.340
Ah!

02:19:04.340 --> 02:19:05.340
Ah!

02:19:05.340 --> 02:19:06.340
Ah!

02:19:06.340 --> 02:19:07.340
Ah!

02:19:07.340 --> 02:19:08.340
Ah!

02:19:08.340 --> 02:19:10.340
Ah!

02:19:10.340 --> 02:19:12.340
Ah!

02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:14.340
Ah!

02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:16.340
Ah!

02:19:16.340 --> 02:19:17.340
Ah!

02:19:17.340 --> 02:19:19.340
Ah!

02:19:19.340 --> 02:19:21.340
Ah!

02:19:21.340 --> 02:19:23.340
Ah!

02:19:23.340 --> 02:19:27.340
Papa, we must make sure the trap door won't open again.

02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:29.340
Ah, yes.

02:19:29.340 --> 02:19:31.340
What's this about a trap door?

02:19:31.340 --> 02:19:32.340
In the kitchen.

02:19:32.340 --> 02:19:34.340
They almost got in before and attacked Mama.

02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:36.340
We reached her just in time.

02:19:43.340 --> 02:19:45.340
Ah, there they are.

02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:50.340
Ah!

02:19:50.340 --> 02:19:52.340
Ah!

02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:54.340
Ah!

02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:55.340
Ah!

02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:56.340
Ah!

02:19:56.340 --> 02:19:57.340
Ah!

02:19:57.340 --> 02:19:58.340
Ah!

02:19:58.340 --> 02:19:59.340
Ah!

02:19:59.340 --> 02:20:00.340
Ah!

02:20:00.340 --> 02:20:01.340
Ah!

02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:02.340
Ah!

02:20:02.340 --> 02:20:03.340
Ah!

02:20:03.340 --> 02:20:04.340
Ah!

02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:05.340
Ah!

02:20:05.340 --> 02:20:06.340
Ah!

02:20:06.340 --> 02:20:07.340
Ah!

02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:08.340
Ah!

02:20:08.340 --> 02:20:09.340
Ah!

02:20:09.340 --> 02:20:11.340
Ah!

02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:12.340
Ah!

02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:13.340
Ah!

02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:14.340
Ah!

02:20:14.340 --> 02:20:15.340
Ah!

02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:16.340
Ah!

02:20:16.340 --> 02:20:17.340
Ah!

02:20:17.340 --> 02:20:18.340
Ah!

02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:19.340
Ah!

02:20:19.340 --> 02:20:20.340
Ah!

02:20:20.340 --> 02:20:21.340
I feel sorry for them.

02:20:21.340 --> 02:20:23.340
It can be helpful, Snowfkin.

02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:24.340
We'll let them out.

02:20:24.340 --> 02:20:25.340
We'll be...

02:20:25.340 --> 02:20:26.340
It in a life.

02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:31.340
It makes me feel very uncomfortable,

02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:33.340
having man-eating plants under the floor.

02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:35.340
Always keep a kettle of boiling water,

02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:38.340
handy in case they break through.

02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:41.340
The children are playing Tarzan.

02:20:41.340 --> 02:20:43.340
They might as well,

02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:45.340
seeing as they've got a jungle to play in.

02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:48.340
Still, planting those seeds might have been a terrible mistake.

02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:51.340
Well, Mama, I'm very glad that you did.

02:20:51.340 --> 02:20:53.340
Just think what I would have missed,

02:20:53.340 --> 02:20:55.340
and movement value suddenly being full

02:20:55.340 --> 02:20:57.340
of tropical plants is wonderful.

02:20:57.340 --> 02:20:59.340
I'm not fond of traveling, as you know,

02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:02.340
and you've brought the plants to me.

02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:04.340
Oh, the trees make it much cooler,

02:21:04.340 --> 02:21:06.340
but those man-eaters,

02:21:06.340 --> 02:21:08.340
who I could do without them.

02:21:08.340 --> 02:21:09.340
Ah!

02:21:09.340 --> 02:21:11.340
Ah!

02:21:16.340 --> 02:21:18.340
You're just like Tarzan.

02:21:18.340 --> 02:21:20.340
Tarzan loves Jane.

02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:22.340
Oh, what bliss!

02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:27.340
Stinky's over there.

02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:28.340
Stinky!

02:21:28.340 --> 02:21:31.340
Tarzan, teach Old Betty lesson.

02:21:31.340 --> 02:21:33.340
Yaaah!

02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:37.340
Ah!

02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:38.340
Ah!

02:21:44.340 --> 02:21:45.340
Oh!

02:21:45.340 --> 02:21:46.340
Oh, dear!

02:21:46.340 --> 02:21:49.340
Pretty stupid moment playing Tarzan

02:21:49.340 --> 02:21:50.340
without wild animals.

02:21:50.340 --> 02:21:52.340
Well, animals don't come from seeds.

02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:54.340
No, but you need them to have a real jungle.

02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:56.340
I can get you some if you want.

02:21:56.340 --> 02:21:57.340
Really?

02:21:57.340 --> 02:21:59.340
I'll do anything for my friends.

02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:01.340
That's very kind of you.

02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:02.340
Not too wild, though.

02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:05.340
No lions or tigers or anything.

02:22:05.340 --> 02:22:07.340
Maybe, yet maybe chimpanzee.

02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:10.340
I know exactly what you need.

02:22:13.340 --> 02:22:15.340
Cheese.

02:22:15.340 --> 02:22:17.340
Bread.

02:22:17.340 --> 02:22:19.340
Ah!

02:22:21.340 --> 02:22:23.340
What are you doing, Mama?

02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:27.340
Well, I don't like the thought of all those man-eaters still in the cellar.

02:22:27.340 --> 02:22:30.340
So your father and I are going to sleep in the bathhouse.

02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:32.340
We'll sleep outdoors, too.

02:22:32.340 --> 02:22:34.340
We've just built ourselves a hut.

02:22:34.340 --> 02:22:36.340
It's not made in a little mind, too.

02:22:36.340 --> 02:22:38.340
Yes, there's plenty of room.

02:22:38.340 --> 02:22:39.340
Oh, right.

02:22:39.340 --> 02:22:42.340
So that only leaves Mr. Himmel and sleeping in the house.

02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:45.340
And he still busy checking all the different plans.

02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:50.340
Mama, is everything ready?

02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:52.340
Oh, yes, dear.

02:22:54.340 --> 02:22:56.340
Oh, I'm all ready.

02:22:56.340 --> 02:22:58.340
Yes, we are, Mr. Himmel and...

02:22:58.340 --> 02:23:00.340
See you later.

02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:11.340
Stinky said he could get some wild animals, Papa.

02:23:11.340 --> 02:23:12.340
Where ever fro?

02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:13.340
I don't know.

02:23:13.340 --> 02:23:14.340
I wouldn't trust him.

02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:17.340
He'll probably put a head jog in your sleeping bag.

02:23:17.340 --> 02:23:18.340
There it is.

02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:19.340
The hut.

02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:23.340
Oh, oh. Very well built.

02:23:23.340 --> 02:23:24.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:24.340 --> 02:23:25.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:25.340 --> 02:23:26.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:27.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:28.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:28.340 --> 02:23:29.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:30.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:31.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:31.340 --> 02:23:32.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:32.340 --> 02:23:33.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:33.340 --> 02:23:34.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:35.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:35.340 --> 02:23:36.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:37.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:37.340 --> 02:23:38.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:38.340 --> 02:23:39.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:39.340 --> 02:23:40.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:40.340 --> 02:23:41.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:41.340 --> 02:23:42.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:42.340 --> 02:23:43.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:43.340 --> 02:23:44.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:45.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:45.340 --> 02:23:46.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:46.340 --> 02:23:47.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:48.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:48.340 --> 02:23:49.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:50.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:51.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:51.340 --> 02:23:52.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:53.340 --> 02:23:54.340
Oh, oh.

02:23:59.340 --> 02:24:00.340
Oh!

02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:02.340
Oh.

02:24:02.340 --> 02:24:04.340
Oh.

02:24:04.340 --> 02:24:06.340
I tell you, it's a wonderful place.

02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:07.340
You love it.

02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:09.340
A real tropical jungle.

02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:11.340
Are you sure it's quite nice here?

02:24:11.340 --> 02:24:13.340
Of course, therein!

02:24:13.340 --> 02:24:14.340
There yaaay!

02:24:14.340 --> 02:24:18.340
Oh, lovely. It is to run free.

02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:24.340
Darling, let's be the first to get to Moomin Valley.

02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:26.340
Oh, my God.

02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:28.340
Oh, my God.

02:24:28.340 --> 02:24:30.340
Oh, my God.

02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:32.340
Oh, my God.

02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:34.340
Oh, my God.

02:24:34.340 --> 02:24:36.340
Oh, my God.

02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:38.340
Oh, my God.

02:24:38.340 --> 02:24:42.340
Oh, my God.

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:44.340
Ugh.

02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:46.340
Ugh.

02:24:46.340 --> 02:24:48.340
Ugh.

02:24:48.340 --> 02:24:52.340
Soon I'll have the largest collection in the botanic world.

02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:56.340
And I will be famous and people will come from all over.

02:24:56.340 --> 02:24:58.340
Ugh.

02:24:58.340 --> 02:25:02.340
Now what have we here?

02:25:02.340 --> 02:25:06.340
Ugh.

02:25:06.340 --> 02:25:08.340
Ugh.

02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:18.340
Go away, I'm not a zoologist.

02:25:18.340 --> 02:25:20.340
Look, Moomin, those must be the monkey stinky promise.

02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:22.340
Well, that's a surprise.

02:25:22.340 --> 02:25:24.340
Not like him at all.

02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:28.340
I just don't trust him.

02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:30.340
What sweet things.

02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:34.340
Just like in Tarzan.

02:25:34.340 --> 02:25:36.340
What was that?

02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:38.340
I don't know.

02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:42.340
Ugh.

02:25:42.340 --> 02:25:48.340
That sounds like some really wild animal, a lion or a tiger.

02:25:48.340 --> 02:25:54.340
I'm frightened, Moomin.

02:25:54.340 --> 02:25:58.340
Huh?

02:25:58.340 --> 02:26:02.340
Ugh.

02:26:02.340 --> 02:26:04.340
Very odd.

02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:06.340
Just like home, isn't it?

02:26:06.340 --> 02:26:08.340
Even if it isn't very big.

02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:10.340
Perhaps we could live here.

02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:12.340
Let's go hunting first.

02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:14.340
I smell Moomin's.

02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:16.340
Oh, be careful darling.

02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:20.340
You're very out of practice.

02:26:20.340 --> 02:26:26.340
I must warn them.

02:26:26.340 --> 02:26:28.340
See anything?

02:26:28.340 --> 02:26:30.340
No other thing.

02:26:30.340 --> 02:26:34.340
I must have been imagination.

02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:36.340
Moomin.

02:26:36.340 --> 02:26:38.340
Keep quiet.

02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:40.340
Little Moin.

02:26:40.340 --> 02:26:42.340
I've just seen some tigers.

02:26:42.340 --> 02:26:44.340
They're coming to get you.

02:26:44.340 --> 02:26:46.340
Tigers.

02:26:46.340 --> 02:26:48.340
Let's get back to the house quick.

02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:50.340
There's no time.

02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:52.340
They're nearly here.

02:26:52.340 --> 02:26:56.340
We'll go to the bathhouse.

02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:04.340
Shall we eat him up?

02:27:04.340 --> 02:27:08.340
You know that Hamilins upset your tummy, dear rest?

02:27:08.340 --> 02:27:12.340
I wonder where the Moomin's are.

02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:18.340
Huh?

02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:24.340
Ugh, just more animals that's all.

02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:30.340
Papa!

02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:36.340
Papa! Help!

02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:40.340
What's the matter, Moomin?

02:27:40.340 --> 02:27:44.340
Little Moin has seen two tigers and they're looking for us.

02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:46.340
Tigers after us.

02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:50.340
That rotten sticky probably told them we're good to eat or something.

02:27:50.340 --> 02:27:52.340
Maybe we are.

02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:53.340
They'll be here in a minute.

02:27:53.340 --> 02:27:57.340
Right, Moomin. You go and find the biggest stone you can and bring it back with you.

02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:01.340
Okay.

02:28:09.340 --> 02:28:13.340
This way.

02:28:23.340 --> 02:28:25.340
Papa, will this one do?

02:28:25.340 --> 02:28:29.340
Yes, that's perfect. Right, get into the bathhouse and it's quickly now.

02:28:53.340 --> 02:28:57.340
Here they come.

02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:05.340
Are you really going to eat them, dear rest?

02:29:05.340 --> 02:29:09.340
Of course, my love. You see, I think they're hiding in that little house up there.

02:29:09.340 --> 02:29:13.340
They've been very quiet if they are.

02:29:13.340 --> 02:29:17.340
Huh, they're just too scared to move. That's all.

02:29:17.340 --> 02:29:21.340
Why's that stone there?

02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:25.340
My darling!

02:29:25.340 --> 02:29:27.340
It's worth, Papa.

02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:31.340
Well, of course, Moomin.

02:29:31.340 --> 02:29:35.340
My husband is drowning.

02:29:35.340 --> 02:29:39.340
Oh, I'm so sorry. Papa, we must help.

02:29:39.340 --> 02:29:43.340
He was just about to try and eat us, Mama.

02:29:43.340 --> 02:29:47.340
I'm sure he won't do it again.

02:29:47.340 --> 02:29:51.340
I suppose so, Moomin.

02:30:11.340 --> 02:30:15.340
Oh, my love.

02:30:15.340 --> 02:30:21.340
I thought I'd see the day. Moomin's rescuing a tiger.

02:30:21.340 --> 02:30:25.340
Here you are, dear. Tie this tightly around him and we'll lift him out.

02:30:25.340 --> 02:30:29.340
Thank you, Mama.

02:30:29.340 --> 02:30:33.340
Oh, darling.

02:30:33.340 --> 02:30:37.340
Are you all right, my love?

02:30:37.340 --> 02:30:39.340
What happened? Did we eat them?

02:30:39.340 --> 02:30:43.340
No, you were drowning and they rescued you.

02:30:43.340 --> 02:30:45.340
Oh, now embarrassing.

02:30:45.340 --> 02:30:47.340
Well, they're in that cabin behind you.

02:30:47.340 --> 02:30:49.340
If you still feel like it.

02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:51.340
Oh, darling.

02:30:51.340 --> 02:30:55.340
Are you all right, my love?

02:30:55.340 --> 02:30:57.340
What happened? Did we eat them?

02:30:57.340 --> 02:30:59.340
They're in that cabin behind you.

02:30:59.340 --> 02:31:03.340
If you still feel hungry, but it was rather good of them to save you.

02:31:03.340 --> 02:31:05.340
No, my appetite's completely gone.

02:31:05.340 --> 02:31:07.340
We'll come back here then and we'll go.

02:31:07.340 --> 02:31:09.340
I'll just jump over.

02:31:15.340 --> 02:31:17.340
Oh!

02:31:17.340 --> 02:31:19.340
What's the matter?

02:31:19.340 --> 02:31:21.340
I can't remember how to jump.

02:31:21.340 --> 02:31:23.340
We've been stuck in that zoo for too long.

02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:25.340
Let's try and swim across, dear.

02:31:27.340 --> 02:31:29.340
Okay.

02:31:31.340 --> 02:31:33.340
Hmm?

02:31:39.340 --> 02:31:42.340
We come, everyone. The tigers are leaving.

02:31:42.340 --> 02:31:45.340
I'm glad you didn't grow.

02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:52.340
I knew they wouldn't be mean enough to eat us after saving him.

02:31:52.340 --> 02:31:56.340
Shall we jump in and swim back as well? It's not far.

02:31:56.340 --> 02:31:58.340
Yes. I'll go first.

02:31:58.340 --> 02:32:00.340
I want to go first.

02:32:00.340 --> 02:32:02.340
Darling, am I?

02:32:02.340 --> 02:32:04.340
Be careful, movement.

02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:06.340
Look over there.

02:32:10.340 --> 02:32:12.340
Crocodiles.

02:32:12.340 --> 02:32:16.340
Hurry up, movement. Swim around the back and come up the ladder.

02:32:22.340 --> 02:32:24.340
Huh?

02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:28.340
How can there be crocodiles in the sea?

02:32:28.340 --> 02:32:31.340
I thought they only lived in fresh water.

02:32:31.340 --> 02:32:34.340
How are we going to get back to the shore now?

02:32:34.340 --> 02:32:36.340
We'll have to wait for a boat to come past.

02:32:36.340 --> 02:32:40.340
No, I'm afraid we'll have to think of something else, Mama.

02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:43.340
We could be waiting for a wink or something for that to happen.

02:32:43.340 --> 02:32:45.340
A whole week!

02:32:45.340 --> 02:32:49.340
But we'll starve. All they'll find is our bones bleached, waiting the sun.

02:32:49.340 --> 02:32:53.340
Don't worry, little mind. Papa will think of something you'll see.

02:32:53.340 --> 02:32:55.340
Good morning.

02:32:57.340 --> 02:32:59.340
Snuffkin, what are you leaving?

02:32:59.340 --> 02:33:01.340
I was going to go sea fishing.

02:33:01.340 --> 02:33:03.340
But I changed my mind.

02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:07.340
I didn't fancy landing a sea monster.

02:33:12.340 --> 02:33:17.340
Help! Someone help! Help anybody!

02:33:17.340 --> 02:33:19.340
That's Mr. Himmelin.

02:33:19.340 --> 02:33:23.340
Oh, the tigers must be after him quickly.

02:33:31.340 --> 02:33:35.340
I never made you so cross. I just told you not to eat my plants.

02:33:35.340 --> 02:33:41.340
And please, someone anyone help!

02:33:41.340 --> 02:33:43.340
Help!

02:33:44.340 --> 02:33:46.340
Let me in!

02:33:55.340 --> 02:33:57.340
That fella's always been clumsy.

02:33:57.340 --> 02:33:59.340
We can't really help him.

02:33:59.340 --> 02:34:00.340
No.

02:34:06.340 --> 02:34:07.340
Are you alright, Himmelin?

02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:09.340
Oh, dear, I think so.

02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:11.340
What about him?

02:34:11.340 --> 02:34:14.340
What do you do when a rhino gets stuck in your brando?

02:34:14.340 --> 02:34:16.340
Oh, this is a new one, aren't we?

02:34:16.340 --> 02:34:18.340
So I'm loose. I can't think of any other way.

02:34:18.340 --> 02:34:20.340
You have to be very careful, though.

02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:22.340
I think you're right.

02:34:32.340 --> 02:34:33.340
Ah, look where you're going!

02:34:33.340 --> 02:34:36.340
It was you who brought all the animals in, wasn't it?

02:34:36.340 --> 02:34:38.340
Yes, you're right. That's what you wanted.

02:34:38.340 --> 02:34:41.340
It's a jungle now. I did a good job.

02:34:41.340 --> 02:34:44.340
Oh, really? Well, they're not wild animals at all.

02:34:44.340 --> 02:34:45.340
They're quite friendly.

02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:47.340
Friendly?

02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:11.340
See what I mean? They make very good pets.

02:35:11.340 --> 02:35:13.340
Cute, aren't they?

02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:23.340
Snake! Go stick where are you?

02:35:25.340 --> 02:35:27.340
What do you want?

02:35:27.340 --> 02:35:30.340
The rhino and the tigers have become pets of the movement family.

02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:32.340
You're not going to let that happen to you.

02:35:32.340 --> 02:35:33.340
Well, are you?

02:35:33.340 --> 02:35:34.340
It's not.

02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:37.340
I'll bring snorked maiden and movement here tonight.

02:35:37.340 --> 02:35:41.340
There's no need to eat all of them. Just bite off their tails, all right?

02:35:41.340 --> 02:35:43.340
Okay.

02:35:45.340 --> 02:35:48.340
You'll be really amazed, like I was.

02:35:48.340 --> 02:35:51.340
It's big enough for both of you to sit on.

02:35:51.340 --> 02:35:53.340
How lovely, a giant water lily.

02:35:53.340 --> 02:35:57.340
I wonder if the seeds came from that box you all found.

02:35:57.340 --> 02:35:59.340
Oh, I can't wait to see it.

02:35:59.340 --> 02:36:01.340
Looking at the size of the jungle,

02:36:01.340 --> 02:36:04.340
there must have been an awful lot of seeds in that box.

02:36:04.340 --> 02:36:07.340
I suppose the wind could have blown them anywhere.

02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:11.340
Where's the giant water lily?

02:36:11.340 --> 02:36:13.340
Let's see now.

02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:16.340
Over there.

02:36:21.340 --> 02:36:23.340
How wonderful.

02:36:23.340 --> 02:36:26.340
You see, I wish you'd learn to trust me.

02:36:26.340 --> 02:36:28.340
I'm a very honest guy.

02:36:30.340 --> 02:36:33.340
It's so soft and pink and beautiful.

02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:36.340
Yeah.

02:36:39.340 --> 02:36:42.340
How romantic to be on a boat made from a flower.

02:36:42.340 --> 02:36:44.340
This is unbelievable.

02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:47.340
Our old box seems to have grown into a tropical swamp.

02:36:47.340 --> 02:36:48.340
It's a lot nicer.

02:36:48.340 --> 02:36:50.340
Hey, stinky.

02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:52.340
Stinky?

02:36:52.340 --> 02:36:53.340
Oh.

02:36:53.340 --> 02:36:56.340
I can't see him anywhere.

02:36:58.340 --> 02:37:00.340
I wonder how far will float.

02:37:00.340 --> 02:37:03.340
It's getting dark, Moomin.

02:37:03.340 --> 02:37:05.340
Whoa!

02:37:07.340 --> 02:37:09.340
Whoa!

02:37:13.340 --> 02:37:15.340
Gotcha!

02:37:15.340 --> 02:37:17.340
We must get away!

02:37:17.340 --> 02:37:19.340
I don't know yet.

02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:21.340
Look, there's the seed.

02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:23.340
Put the crooked aisles.

02:37:23.340 --> 02:37:26.340
Over there, start making a boat.

02:37:26.340 --> 02:37:30.340
Well, it's the only way we'll get away from least monster.

02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:32.340
Whoa!

02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:50.340
Keep going, Snorkmaid.

02:37:50.340 --> 02:37:52.340
We're almost there.

02:37:54.340 --> 02:37:56.340
Wait.

02:37:56.340 --> 02:38:00.340
Moomin and Snorkmaid kept swimming as fast as they could.

02:38:00.340 --> 02:38:03.340
They had a head start on the snake, but now he was catching up.

02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:06.340
Even though Moomin's are very good swimmers,

02:38:06.340 --> 02:38:10.340
unfortunately for them, so are snakes.

02:38:12.340 --> 02:38:19.340
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

02:38:19.340 --> 02:38:26.340
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:38:26.340 --> 02:38:30.340
They're always happy and always at play.

02:38:30.340 --> 02:38:34.340
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:37.340
The movements.

02:38:37.340 --> 02:38:41.340
The movements.

02:38:41.340 --> 02:38:48.340
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

02:38:49.340 --> 02:38:56.340
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:38:56.340 --> 02:39:00.340
They're always happy and always at play.

02:39:00.340 --> 02:39:04.340
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:39:04.340 --> 02:39:07.340
The movements.

02:39:07.340 --> 02:39:11.340
The movements.

02:39:11.340 --> 02:39:17.340
The movements.

02:39:19.340 --> 02:39:23.340
Here they are for one and all.

02:39:23.340 --> 02:39:26.340
The movements are about to come.

02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:29.340
Come on and sit down here with me.

02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:32.340
They have for you on your TV.

02:39:32.340 --> 02:39:36.340
They are the movements.

02:39:36.340 --> 02:39:39.340
Here they are for one and all.

02:39:39.340 --> 02:39:42.340
The movements are about to come.

02:39:42.340 --> 02:39:45.340
Come on and sit down here with me.

02:39:45.340 --> 02:39:47.340
Here for you on your TV.

02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:50.340
They are the movements.

02:39:50.340 --> 02:39:53.340
They are the movements.

02:39:53.340 --> 02:39:56.340
So come with me, give me your hand.

02:39:56.340 --> 02:39:59.340
I'll take you up to a moment land.

02:39:59.340 --> 02:40:02.340
You can fly just like a bird.

02:40:02.340 --> 02:40:04.340
Sing that song ever.

02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:07.340
There were the movements.

02:40:07.340 --> 02:40:10.340
There were the movements.

02:40:10.340 --> 02:40:13.340
There were the movements.

02:40:13.340 --> 02:40:18.340
There were the movements.

02:40:18.340 --> 02:40:22.340
There were the movements.

02:40:43.340 --> 02:40:50.340
The movements.

02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:57.340
The movements.

02:40:57.340 --> 02:41:06.340
The movements.

02:41:06.340 --> 02:41:08.340
The movements.

02:41:08.340 --> 02:41:10.340
Where are you moving?

02:41:10.340 --> 02:41:12.340
It's not made in.

02:41:12.340 --> 02:41:16.900
The rhino and the tigers that stinky set free from the zoo are now living in the jungle

02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:21.940
that has grown up around Moomin house, and have settled into the restful life of Moomin Valley.

02:41:24.740 --> 02:41:26.340
Hey, have you seen Moomin?

02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:28.340
No, you haven't seen him all evening.

02:41:30.340 --> 02:41:32.340
I wonder where they got to.

02:41:34.340 --> 02:41:39.020
Meanwhile, Moomin and Snorkmaiden chased by the snake, are swimming as fast as they can

02:41:39.020 --> 02:41:40.020
out to sea.

02:41:42.340 --> 02:41:43.540
I can't swim another.

02:41:43.540 --> 02:41:45.540
Snorkmaiden, you must!

02:41:47.940 --> 02:41:50.740
Hey! Hey, you there!

02:41:54.740 --> 02:41:56.740
Come on, Snorkmaiden, nearly there!

02:41:57.740 --> 02:42:01.940
Look, there's a couple of hippos that come and towards us. We better get them on board.

02:42:01.940 --> 02:42:05.940
That's funny. I haven't heard about any hippos reported missing from the zoo lately.

02:42:07.140 --> 02:42:09.140
Just a bit further, Snorkmaiden.

02:42:12.740 --> 02:42:16.740
We made it.

02:42:16.740 --> 02:42:20.740
I didn't know hippos could climb so well.

02:42:20.740 --> 02:42:26.740
Oh, thank you so much. There was a huge snake chasing us.

02:42:26.740 --> 02:42:29.940
Yes, we saw you were lucky we came along when we did.

02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:32.340
Thank you for your help. Who's ship is this?

02:42:32.340 --> 02:42:34.340
Ours, we're from the zoo.

02:42:34.340 --> 02:42:38.340
The zoo? Oh, you've got one of the crocodiles.

02:42:38.340 --> 02:42:40.340
Yes, and a lot of trouble he gave us as well.

02:42:41.140 --> 02:42:44.340
There's another one around here somewhere. We saw them.

02:42:44.340 --> 02:42:47.140
Yes, we know there is, but we haven't been able to find him yet.

02:42:47.140 --> 02:42:51.140
Oh, boy, I wish they'd come as quietly as you hippos did.

02:42:51.140 --> 02:42:53.140
Hippos? Hippos?

02:42:53.140 --> 02:42:57.140
Which zoo are you from? I bet they'd pay well to get you back.

02:42:57.140 --> 02:43:00.340
Now, look here. I'm a Mormon, not a hippo.

02:43:00.340 --> 02:43:02.340
Are you saying that I look like a hippo?

02:43:02.340 --> 02:43:05.140
Well, perhaps they don't look exactly like hippos.

02:43:05.140 --> 02:43:07.140
No, but they're close enough, Cam.

02:43:07.940 --> 02:43:10.740
I'm sure they've escaped from the zoo somewhere, though.

02:43:10.740 --> 02:43:11.540
Yes, sir.

02:43:11.540 --> 02:43:14.740
We haven't escaped from anywhere, certainly not a zoo.

02:43:14.740 --> 02:43:17.140
We live in Moomin Valley. We're Moomin's.

02:43:17.140 --> 02:43:19.940
It's all right, Snork Maiden. I'll not be taken for a hippo.

02:43:19.940 --> 02:43:21.540
Come on, let's run for it.

02:43:21.540 --> 02:43:25.140
Hey, wait. There's a nice cozy cage already for you.

02:43:25.140 --> 02:43:26.340
Hurry, Snork Maiden.

02:43:26.340 --> 02:43:28.340
Ask to them.

02:43:28.340 --> 02:43:30.340
Stop them now. Don't let them get away.

02:43:31.540 --> 02:43:33.540
Where are we going, Moomin?

02:43:33.540 --> 02:43:35.540
Now to the sea.

02:43:37.940 --> 02:43:40.340
Quickly, man, lower the live boat.

02:43:40.340 --> 02:43:42.340
They're not going to put us in any zoo.

02:43:47.540 --> 02:43:50.740
Why did you come back? I thought you were on the boat.

02:43:50.740 --> 02:43:51.540
Oh, no.

02:43:51.540 --> 02:43:54.340
Don't worry. I never eat anything when I'm not swimming.

02:43:54.340 --> 02:43:56.340
Are you sure?

02:43:56.340 --> 02:43:58.340
I'm sure. Now where's this ship?

02:43:59.540 --> 02:44:01.540
Oh, they're catching up with us.

02:44:01.540 --> 02:44:04.340
They want to put us in a cage and take us to the zoo.

02:44:04.340 --> 02:44:07.540
Me too, I expect. They're always trying to get me.

02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:08.740
They've got one of the crocodiles.

02:44:08.740 --> 02:44:10.900
Oh, did they? They were my friends.

02:44:10.900 --> 02:44:13.060
Right. Hang on to me, you two.

02:44:13.060 --> 02:44:15.540
I'm certainly not going back to any zoo.

02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:17.540
Never, let's go.

02:44:18.740 --> 02:44:19.540
Oh, no.

02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:21.540
Hold on tight.

02:44:23.540 --> 02:44:26.740
Come back, you horrible reptile. Come back.

02:44:30.340 --> 02:44:32.340
Moomin's been caught by a big snake.

02:44:32.340 --> 02:44:35.060
Yes, mama snorked maiden as well.

02:44:35.060 --> 02:44:37.540
Dear stinky, that's not true, is it?

02:44:37.540 --> 02:44:40.500
I wish people would realize that I almost never lie.

02:44:40.500 --> 02:44:43.140
I'm sorry about them, but I thought I'd better tell you.

02:44:43.140 --> 02:44:46.180
There aren't any snakes that big in Moomin Valley.

02:44:46.180 --> 02:44:47.700
There are tigers here, aren't there?

02:44:47.700 --> 02:44:49.140
Well, there's big snakes too.

02:44:50.020 --> 02:44:52.100
You brought the snake here, didn't you?

02:44:52.100 --> 02:44:54.980
Papa, I'm not saying that I believe him,

02:44:54.980 --> 02:44:58.820
but I think we'd better look for them just to be on the safe side, don't you?

02:44:58.820 --> 02:45:02.180
Okay, don't believe me. I told you so my conscience is clear.

02:45:02.180 --> 02:45:04.740
Where exactly did the snake attack them, stinky?

02:45:04.740 --> 02:45:06.740
Down in the swamp by the sea.

02:45:06.740 --> 02:45:07.940
Let's go, mama.

02:45:08.820 --> 02:45:10.100
I'll come with you.

02:45:10.100 --> 02:45:11.780
No, you'd better stay little, my,

02:45:11.780 --> 02:45:14.340
until Moomin, where we've gone, if he comes back,

02:45:14.340 --> 02:45:16.980
he'll only worry if there's no one here.

02:45:16.980 --> 02:45:19.700
And stinky, you'll show us where to go.

02:45:19.700 --> 02:45:20.340
Okay.

02:45:20.420 --> 02:45:22.020
Okay.

02:45:28.020 --> 02:45:31.460
Oh, no.

02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:32.580
Oh, no.

02:45:32.580 --> 02:45:32.980
Oh, oh, no.

02:45:32.980 --> 02:45:34.500
Hey, you!

02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:36.660
Have you eaten Moomin and Snorkmaden?

02:45:36.660 --> 02:45:38.980
It's alright, mama. We're here.

02:45:38.980 --> 02:45:40.980
Oh, praise the boob, the boob, the boob.

02:45:40.980 --> 02:45:42.220
Say...

02:45:42.220 --> 02:45:43.220
Me time, you friend.

02:45:43.220 --> 02:45:44.900
What a very big friend.

02:45:44.900 --> 02:45:47.860
Please come in as much of you as you like.

02:45:47.860 --> 02:45:49.940
Stinky just told us that you and Snorkmaden

02:45:49.940 --> 02:45:52.480
They didn't been caught by a big snake, so we...

02:45:52.480 --> 02:45:54.480
Where are you going, Stinky?

02:45:55.480 --> 02:45:57.080
She did chase us at first.

02:45:57.080 --> 02:45:58.580
Then we managed to get on a boat,

02:45:58.580 --> 02:46:00.180
but they wanted to put us in a cage,

02:46:00.180 --> 02:46:02.780
so we jumped back in the sea, met the snake again,

02:46:02.780 --> 02:46:04.020
then they tried to catch her too,

02:46:04.020 --> 02:46:06.680
so she helped us to get away, and now she's our friend.

02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:08.180
Who are they?

02:46:08.180 --> 02:46:09.620
Men from the zoo.

02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:11.620
They've come to recapture all the animals

02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:13.060
and take them away from the jungle

02:46:13.060 --> 02:46:14.820
and put them in cages again.

02:46:14.820 --> 02:46:15.820
Mm, nice.

02:46:15.820 --> 02:46:18.260
Second, you don't want to go back in the zoo.

02:46:18.260 --> 02:46:20.340
Papa, we've got to protect our friends.

02:46:20.340 --> 02:46:21.860
Yes, we have.

02:46:21.860 --> 02:46:24.300
I'm sure that the tigers and that nice rhino

02:46:24.300 --> 02:46:25.500
don't want to go back even.

02:46:25.500 --> 02:46:27.540
Oh, of course they don't.

02:46:27.540 --> 02:46:30.340
They want to be free and live again, our jungle.

02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:31.900
Why don't you go and explore it?

02:46:31.900 --> 02:46:33.820
I'm sure it'll be just like home.

02:46:33.820 --> 02:46:35.140
And if you see the zoo people,

02:46:35.140 --> 02:46:36.900
you can come back here, can't you?

02:46:37.900 --> 02:46:40.340
I'm sure you'll like it here, Mrs. Snake.

02:46:40.340 --> 02:46:42.460
Yes, I'm sure I will.

02:46:42.460 --> 02:46:44.460
Come on, I'll show you the jungle.

02:46:44.460 --> 02:46:45.460
Eh!

02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:50.460
I'm so relieved that you're both all right at home.

02:46:50.460 --> 02:46:54.460
So are we, Mama, but there's something we haven't told you.

02:46:54.460 --> 02:46:57.460
Yes, they thought we were hippopotamuses.

02:46:57.460 --> 02:46:58.460
What?

02:46:58.460 --> 02:46:59.460
Who did?

02:46:59.460 --> 02:47:01.460
They need their eyes, Destiny.

02:47:01.460 --> 02:47:03.460
The men from the zoo.

02:47:03.460 --> 02:47:05.460
They thought we had escaped from another zoo

02:47:05.460 --> 02:47:08.460
and were trying to catch us and they nearly succeeded.

02:47:08.460 --> 02:47:09.460
Now, rude.

02:47:09.460 --> 02:47:12.460
We're not at all like hippos, the cheek of it.

02:47:13.460 --> 02:47:16.460
So these men were only trying to capture our new friends,

02:47:16.460 --> 02:47:18.460
but you and Snork Maiden as well.

02:47:18.460 --> 02:47:20.460
And me and Papa, if they'd known about us.

02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:21.460
That's right, Mama.

02:47:21.460 --> 02:47:22.460
They're idiots.

02:47:22.460 --> 02:47:25.460
Hippopotamuses don't wear aprons or right memoirs.

02:47:25.460 --> 02:47:27.460
That's really made me angry.

02:47:27.460 --> 02:47:30.460
I bet they never faced the wrath of a movement Papa before.

02:47:30.460 --> 02:47:35.460
I want to see you wrap yourself round and choke somebody.

02:47:35.460 --> 02:47:36.460
I know.

02:47:36.460 --> 02:47:37.460
How about the tiger?

02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:38.460
He do.

02:47:38.460 --> 02:47:40.460
I'd rather not.

02:47:40.460 --> 02:47:43.460
We became friends in the zoo.

02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:44.460
Oh, I know.

02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:45.460
Choke stinky.

02:47:45.460 --> 02:47:46.460
That'll be much better.

02:47:46.460 --> 02:47:52.460
Yes, my dewey did let us out of the zoo.

02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:54.460
Well, you're a great disappointment to me.

02:47:54.460 --> 02:47:57.460
I let you out because I thought you'd attack the movements,

02:47:57.460 --> 02:47:58.460
but you have tea with them instead.

02:47:58.460 --> 02:47:59.460
You're pathetic.

02:47:59.460 --> 02:48:00.460
You know that?

02:48:00.460 --> 02:48:03.460
I'm sorry, but we were brought up in captivity

02:48:03.460 --> 02:48:05.460
and we never had to hunt for our food.

02:48:05.460 --> 02:48:07.460
All our meals are brought to us, you see.

02:48:07.460 --> 02:48:10.460
But your tigers what do you eat them?

02:48:10.460 --> 02:48:13.460
Well, we love cat food.

02:48:13.460 --> 02:48:14.460
Cat food.

02:48:14.460 --> 02:48:17.460
Oh, I don't believe it.

02:48:17.460 --> 02:48:21.460
Yes, it's easy to chew and it leaves our fur all sleek and shiny.

02:48:21.460 --> 02:48:24.460
We like the yellow tins with the black cat, don't we, honey?

02:48:24.460 --> 02:48:25.460
Yes, it's our favorite.

02:48:25.460 --> 02:48:28.460
You wouldn't happen to have any on you, would you?

02:48:38.460 --> 02:48:39.460
Mama!

02:48:39.460 --> 02:48:41.460
Papa, quickly!

02:48:42.460 --> 02:48:43.460
They're here.

02:48:43.460 --> 02:48:45.460
The zoo men are here.

02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:49.460
Oh, get all the animals into the house first, you.

02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:51.460
Hurry, moment.

02:48:51.460 --> 02:48:52.460
Okay, Papa.

02:48:55.460 --> 02:48:57.460
The zoo men have come to get you.

02:48:57.460 --> 02:48:58.460
They're here.

02:48:58.460 --> 02:48:59.460
The zoo men are here.

02:48:59.460 --> 02:49:02.460
Oh, get all the animals into the house first.

02:49:02.460 --> 02:49:03.460
Hurry, moment.

02:49:03.460 --> 02:49:04.460
Okay, Papa.

02:49:05.460 --> 02:49:07.460
The zoo men have come to get you.

02:49:07.460 --> 02:49:10.460
Hurry, you'll be safe in the moment house.

02:49:10.460 --> 02:49:12.460
Quick as you can, Rhino.

02:49:12.460 --> 02:49:13.460
Into the house.

02:49:13.460 --> 02:49:14.460
Go on.

02:49:19.460 --> 02:49:21.460
Now, Rhino, push him.

02:49:21.460 --> 02:49:22.460
I'm sorry.

02:49:35.460 --> 02:49:40.460
Um, I don't think that's a good place to hide, Mrs. Snake.

02:49:43.460 --> 02:49:46.460
I'm afraid that doesn't look quite right, Tiger.

02:49:46.460 --> 02:49:49.460
I thought I might just look like a thick rug.

02:49:49.460 --> 02:49:52.460
I'll just lie here like a beautiful porcelain ornament.

02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:55.460
They'll never know we're here, darling.

02:49:55.460 --> 02:49:59.460
Well, they'd never expect to find a Rhino under there.

02:49:59.460 --> 02:50:00.460
That's what I thought.

02:50:00.460 --> 02:50:01.460
Where are they?

02:50:01.460 --> 02:50:04.460
They can't just have vanished into thin air.

02:50:07.460 --> 02:50:08.460
Hmm.

02:50:08.460 --> 02:50:09.460
Look.

02:50:09.460 --> 02:50:10.460
Up there.

02:50:11.460 --> 02:50:12.460
In the chimney.

02:50:17.460 --> 02:50:19.460
So they're in there, are they?

02:50:32.460 --> 02:50:33.460
Papa!

02:50:35.460 --> 02:50:38.460
They've seen the snake. They're nearly here.

02:50:41.460 --> 02:50:44.460
Now, I want you to calm down and be quiet, everyone.

02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:45.460
We won't let them take you away.

02:50:45.460 --> 02:50:49.460
I promise you they'll have a fight on the hands if they try.

02:50:49.460 --> 02:50:50.460
Teeth, please, my love.

02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:51.460
Of course, dear.

02:51:02.460 --> 02:51:03.460
Hello.

02:51:06.460 --> 02:51:07.460
Hello.

02:51:08.460 --> 02:51:09.460
Hello.

02:51:10.460 --> 02:51:11.460
Hello.

02:51:17.460 --> 02:51:19.460
Hello, having a picnic, are you?

02:51:19.460 --> 02:51:20.460
It's lovely day for you.

02:51:20.460 --> 02:51:21.460
Not at all.

02:51:21.460 --> 02:51:23.460
We're all here from the zoo, sir.

02:51:23.460 --> 02:51:25.460
Oh, are you on some sort of expedition?

02:51:25.460 --> 02:51:28.460
Excuse me, but are you the owner of this house?

02:51:28.460 --> 02:51:31.460
Yes, indeed, I am. I'm moving Papa.

02:51:31.460 --> 02:51:33.460
Well, what can I do for you?

02:51:33.460 --> 02:51:35.460
Well, you could send out the animals hiding in your house.

02:51:35.460 --> 02:51:37.460
That'll do for a start.

02:51:37.460 --> 02:51:38.460
Animals?

02:51:38.460 --> 02:51:39.460
Oh, no.

02:51:39.460 --> 02:51:42.460
We have firm believers that they belong outside.

02:51:42.460 --> 02:51:46.460
Sir, you can't see from where you are, but I can assure you that there is a python

02:51:46.460 --> 02:51:48.460
sticking its head out of your chimney.

02:51:48.460 --> 02:51:49.460
A python?

02:51:49.460 --> 02:51:51.460
Yes, that's right.

02:51:51.460 --> 02:51:53.460
No, it isn't.

02:51:53.460 --> 02:51:54.460
It isn't.

02:51:54.460 --> 02:51:56.460
No, it's my daughter.

02:51:56.460 --> 02:51:58.460
She happens to look like a python.

02:51:58.460 --> 02:52:01.460
Not all the time you understand.

02:52:01.460 --> 02:52:03.460
Right, come on, man.

02:52:03.460 --> 02:52:05.460
We'll go and get the zoo's property.

02:52:05.460 --> 02:52:07.460
No, you will not enter my house.

02:52:07.460 --> 02:52:09.460
All right, well, you let the animals out.

02:52:09.460 --> 02:52:10.460
We won't have to.

02:52:10.460 --> 02:52:11.460
It's up to you, sir.

02:52:11.460 --> 02:52:14.460
There are no animals, and you won't enter my house.

02:52:14.460 --> 02:52:15.460
Now, wait a minute.

02:52:15.460 --> 02:52:16.460
I do believe, yes.

02:52:16.460 --> 02:52:19.460
You're one of those hippos, aren't you?

02:52:19.460 --> 02:52:20.460
I am not.

02:52:20.460 --> 02:52:23.460
I'm moving Papa, and I am the owner of this house.

02:52:23.460 --> 02:52:24.460
No, you're not.

02:52:24.460 --> 02:52:25.460
You're a hippopotamus.

02:52:25.460 --> 02:52:26.460
How did?

02:52:26.460 --> 02:52:30.460
A hippo who owns a house, and it's also running in an illegal zoo.

02:52:30.460 --> 02:52:32.460
Break down the doors.

02:52:32.460 --> 02:52:34.460
That is against the law.

02:52:34.460 --> 02:52:35.460
Oh, it is, isn't?

02:52:35.460 --> 02:52:39.460
Well, there's a nice cage winning for you as well, woman Papa, hippo.

02:52:39.460 --> 02:52:43.460
I warn you, if you touch that door, you'll regret it.

02:52:43.460 --> 02:52:44.460
Go, yeah?

02:52:46.460 --> 02:52:47.460
Great boys.

02:52:47.460 --> 02:52:48.460
Let's go in.

02:52:48.460 --> 02:52:49.460
Charge!

02:52:54.460 --> 02:52:55.460
Ah!

02:52:55.460 --> 02:52:56.460
Ah!

02:52:56.460 --> 02:52:57.460
Ah!

02:52:57.460 --> 02:52:58.460
Ah!

02:52:58.460 --> 02:52:59.460
Ah!

02:52:59.460 --> 02:53:00.460
Ah!

02:53:00.460 --> 02:53:01.460
Ah!

02:53:01.460 --> 02:53:02.460
Ah!

02:53:02.460 --> 02:53:03.460
Ah!

02:53:03.460 --> 02:53:04.460
Ah!

02:53:04.460 --> 02:53:05.460
Ah!

02:53:05.460 --> 02:53:06.460
Ah!

02:53:06.460 --> 02:53:07.460
Ah!

02:53:07.460 --> 02:53:08.460
Ah!

02:53:08.460 --> 02:53:10.460
Ah!

02:53:10.460 --> 02:53:11.460
Ah!

02:53:11.460 --> 02:53:12.460
Ah!

02:53:12.460 --> 02:53:14.460
Now then, what's going on?

02:53:14.460 --> 02:53:16.460
Little Mike brought the inspector.

02:53:16.460 --> 02:53:19.460
All right, what do you men think you're doing?

02:53:19.460 --> 02:53:22.460
Ah, there are high animals from the zoo in this house.

02:53:22.460 --> 02:53:23.460
We want them back.

02:53:23.460 --> 02:53:26.460
I tried to reason with the hippo, but it was no good.

02:53:26.460 --> 02:53:30.460
Oh, have you know that's willful destruction of property, my good man?

02:53:30.460 --> 02:53:31.460
It's not.

02:53:31.460 --> 02:53:32.460
Well, for we're from the zoo.

02:53:32.460 --> 02:53:33.460
We got to get in somehow.

02:53:33.460 --> 02:53:38.460
Oh, have you, and can you be sure that there are zoo animals in there?

02:53:38.460 --> 02:53:40.460
You just take a look up there at the chimney.

02:53:40.460 --> 02:53:42.460
That's all I'm sure.

02:53:42.460 --> 02:53:44.460
Go on.

02:53:44.460 --> 02:53:47.460
See that python's head sticking out?

02:53:47.460 --> 02:53:49.460
That's all.

02:53:49.460 --> 02:53:51.460
I can't see a python's head.

02:53:51.460 --> 02:53:53.460
There was a python's head up there.

02:53:53.460 --> 02:53:54.460
I saw it.

02:53:54.460 --> 02:53:57.460
Ugh, I can't breathe.

02:53:57.460 --> 02:54:00.460
Now you listen to me, zoo man.

02:54:00.460 --> 02:54:01.460
Huh?

02:54:01.460 --> 02:54:04.460
Either you stop bothering my friends or I'll arrest you.

02:54:04.460 --> 02:54:05.460
Is that clear?

02:54:05.460 --> 02:54:06.460
Well, is it?

02:54:06.460 --> 02:54:07.460
Yes, sir, it is.

02:54:07.460 --> 02:54:09.460
But what about the zoo animals?

02:54:09.460 --> 02:54:11.460
You heard the inspector.

02:54:11.460 --> 02:54:12.460
Now go away.

02:54:12.460 --> 02:54:13.460
Do you see that?

02:54:13.460 --> 02:54:14.460
See what?

02:54:14.460 --> 02:54:15.460
The hippopotamus.

02:54:15.460 --> 02:54:16.460
What?

02:54:16.460 --> 02:54:17.460
The hippopotamus.

02:54:17.460 --> 02:54:19.460
He's a fellow's been hiding all our zoo animals.

02:54:19.460 --> 02:54:21.460
A nice cage lined up for him as well, inspector.

02:54:21.460 --> 02:54:23.460
Oh, so that's your plan, is it?

02:54:23.460 --> 02:54:25.460
Ha, they want to take them all.

02:54:25.460 --> 02:54:27.460
Moomin's, Norkman, Mama, and Papa.

02:54:27.460 --> 02:54:29.460
Hmm, the criminal conspiracy.

02:54:29.460 --> 02:54:30.460
Conspiracy?

02:54:30.460 --> 02:54:33.460
It would probably be called kidnapping.

02:54:33.460 --> 02:54:35.460
Once you can't kidnap a hippo.

02:54:35.460 --> 02:54:37.460
That's a movement.

02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:39.460
It could be white slavery, though.

02:54:39.460 --> 02:54:42.460
I'm sure I could add incitement to riot to the list.

02:54:42.460 --> 02:54:45.460
Now I hate paperwork, so I'll tell you one.

02:54:45.460 --> 02:54:47.460
If you're gone within 10 minutes, I won't arrest you.

02:54:47.460 --> 02:54:50.460
Why don't you put them in the deepest dungeon, inspector?

02:54:50.460 --> 02:54:52.460
The one with all the rats and spiders and scorpions

02:54:52.460 --> 02:54:54.460
that'll teach them to put Moomin's encages.

02:54:54.460 --> 02:54:56.460
That's a good idea, little mind.

02:54:56.460 --> 02:54:58.460
They like animals.

02:54:58.460 --> 02:55:01.460
I'll start counting now.

02:55:01.460 --> 02:55:04.460
One, two, three.

02:55:04.460 --> 02:55:05.460
Get around, men.

02:55:05.460 --> 02:55:06.460
Quickly.

02:55:06.460 --> 02:55:07.460
All right.

02:55:07.460 --> 02:55:09.460
We'll have to think quickly on this one, men.

02:55:09.460 --> 02:55:10.460
Come on now.

02:55:10.460 --> 02:55:12.460
Does anybody have any smart ideas?

02:55:12.460 --> 02:55:13.460
Come on.

02:55:13.460 --> 02:55:16.460
We're running out of time.

02:55:16.460 --> 02:55:17.460
One minute.

02:55:17.460 --> 02:55:19.460
Look, guys, we're going to figure something out right now.

02:55:19.460 --> 02:55:20.460
Ready and look.

02:55:20.460 --> 02:55:23.460
One minute, 30 seconds.

02:55:23.460 --> 02:55:24.460
Two minutes.

02:55:24.460 --> 02:55:26.460
Three minutes, 30 seconds.

02:55:26.460 --> 02:55:27.460
Look.

02:55:27.460 --> 02:55:28.460
Leave us alone.

02:55:28.460 --> 02:55:29.460
Way we're conferring.

02:55:29.460 --> 02:55:30.460
All right.

02:55:30.460 --> 02:55:32.460
Six minutes and 50 seconds.

02:55:32.460 --> 02:55:33.460
Time's up.

02:55:33.460 --> 02:55:34.460
You're cheating.

02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:35.460
The police don't cheat.

02:55:35.460 --> 02:55:37.460
And now you've got...

02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:39.460
Nine minutes and 30 seconds.

02:55:39.460 --> 02:55:40.460
How about that?

02:55:40.460 --> 02:55:41.460
Nine minutes, 50 bucks.

02:55:41.460 --> 02:55:42.460
I give up.

02:55:42.460 --> 02:55:44.460
Everybody beat it.

02:55:44.460 --> 02:55:45.460
But we're still discussing it.

02:55:45.460 --> 02:55:46.460
No, we're not.

02:55:46.460 --> 02:55:47.460
We're getting out.

02:55:47.460 --> 02:55:48.460
Look, everyone.

02:55:48.460 --> 02:55:49.460
The zoom in.

02:55:49.460 --> 02:55:51.460
We're running off.

02:55:51.460 --> 02:55:52.460
Great.

02:55:52.460 --> 02:55:55.460
You've got to come and see this, Mama.

02:55:55.460 --> 02:55:57.460
Nine minutes and 50 and a half seconds.

02:55:57.460 --> 02:55:58.460
And don't come back.

02:55:58.460 --> 02:56:00.460
We'll be the dungeon for you.

02:56:00.460 --> 02:56:03.460
And I make that 10 minutes up to you.

02:56:03.460 --> 02:56:04.460
You saved his little mind.

02:56:04.460 --> 02:56:07.460
It was really clever of you to fetch the inspector.

02:56:07.460 --> 02:56:10.460
Well, there were too many of them for me to fight.

02:56:10.460 --> 02:56:11.460
Okay.

02:56:11.460 --> 02:56:12.460
Everyone.

02:56:13.460 --> 02:56:15.460
Help!

02:56:15.460 --> 02:56:18.460
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

02:56:18.460 --> 02:56:20.460
And so everyone was saved.

02:56:20.460 --> 02:56:22.460
And eventually, they all came out of the house

02:56:22.460 --> 02:56:24.460
to go and have fun in the jungle again.

02:56:24.460 --> 02:56:26.460
As long as the warm weather lasted,

02:56:26.460 --> 02:56:28.460
there were plenty of things to do.

02:56:28.460 --> 02:56:30.460
But one day, the weather changed.

02:56:30.460 --> 02:56:33.460
And cold winds blew down Moomin Valley.

02:56:35.460 --> 02:56:38.460
Oh, it feels like autumn has arrived.

02:56:38.460 --> 02:56:40.460
The jungle won't like the cold weather.

02:56:41.460 --> 02:56:43.460
Do you think it will die, Mama?

02:56:43.460 --> 02:56:45.460
I'm afraid it will, little mind.

02:56:45.460 --> 02:56:49.460
It grew very quickly, so perhaps it will go the same way.

02:56:51.460 --> 02:56:52.460
And it did.

02:56:52.460 --> 02:56:56.460
The whole jungle with it and died in just one night.

02:57:02.460 --> 02:57:04.460
I think I've done a cold coming, Mama.

02:57:04.460 --> 02:57:05.460
I'm sorry.

02:57:05.460 --> 02:57:06.460
I can't get the house any hotter.

02:57:06.460 --> 02:57:07.460
I missed the zoo.

02:57:07.460 --> 02:57:09.460
At least it was warm now.

02:57:09.460 --> 02:57:11.460
Yes, this cold is awful.

02:57:11.460 --> 02:57:14.460
It would warm them up if we burned the dead jungle.

02:57:31.460 --> 02:57:32.460
Now they're happy again.

02:57:32.460 --> 02:57:33.460
But for how long?

02:57:40.460 --> 02:57:42.460
Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys.

02:57:42.460 --> 02:57:43.460
It's cold again.

02:57:43.460 --> 02:57:45.460
It was warm in our cages.

02:57:45.460 --> 02:57:47.460
But you're free here.

02:57:47.460 --> 02:57:49.460
Yes, free to have pneumonia.

02:57:49.460 --> 02:57:53.460
I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spanning the winter here.

02:57:53.460 --> 02:57:57.460
Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys.

02:57:57.460 --> 02:57:58.460
It's cold again.

02:57:58.460 --> 02:58:00.460
It was warm in our cages.

02:58:00.460 --> 02:58:02.460
What are you afraid here?

02:58:02.460 --> 02:58:04.460
Yes, free to have pneumonia.

02:58:04.460 --> 02:58:08.460
I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spanning the winter here.

02:58:10.460 --> 02:58:14.460
And so all the animals decided to return to the zoo.

02:58:14.460 --> 02:58:17.460
Perhaps we'll let you come back next summer, Mrs. Snake.

02:58:17.460 --> 02:58:20.460
I like that when it's warmer.

02:58:24.460 --> 02:58:27.460
Hey, look, the animals are on their way back.

02:58:27.460 --> 02:58:29.460
All right.

02:58:29.460 --> 02:58:30.460
That wonderful.

02:58:30.460 --> 02:58:32.460
Oh, it's good to see you.

02:58:32.460 --> 02:58:34.460
You don't know how much we missed you.

02:58:34.460 --> 02:58:36.460
Oh, good.

02:58:36.460 --> 02:58:37.460
Gosh.

02:58:37.460 --> 02:58:39.460
It's good to see you.

02:58:39.460 --> 02:58:40.460
Come on now.

02:58:40.460 --> 02:58:41.460
Get back to your cages quickly.

02:58:41.460 --> 02:58:43.460
We've been keeping them nice and warm for you.

02:58:43.460 --> 02:58:45.460
Go on, off you go now.

02:58:45.460 --> 02:58:48.460
You look all right, but I'm sure you must all be starving.

02:58:48.460 --> 02:58:51.460
We'll do you a special meal tonight.

02:58:51.460 --> 02:58:52.460
All right.

02:58:52.460 --> 02:58:54.460
Ah, the hippos too.

02:58:54.460 --> 02:58:56.460
For the last time, we're moments, not hippos.

02:58:56.460 --> 02:58:57.460
You must be cold as well.

02:58:57.460 --> 02:58:59.460
We'll warm up a cage for you.

02:58:59.460 --> 02:59:01.460
It'll be nice and cozy there.

02:59:01.460 --> 02:59:02.460
No.

02:59:02.460 --> 02:59:04.460
No, it just came to send the animals off.

02:59:04.460 --> 02:59:06.460
Hey, get a cage ready for the hippos.

02:59:06.460 --> 02:59:07.460
Will you?

02:59:07.460 --> 02:59:08.460
Nice and warm.

02:59:08.460 --> 02:59:10.460
At the risk of sounding repetitive.

02:59:10.460 --> 02:59:11.460
We are moments.

02:59:11.460 --> 02:59:12.460
Don't be ridiculous.

02:59:12.460 --> 02:59:14.460
We'll let it here.

02:59:14.460 --> 02:59:16.460
But we're nothing like hippos.

02:59:16.460 --> 02:59:20.460
We know you're not pure breads, but the public will never be able to tell.

02:59:25.460 --> 02:59:28.460
Do we have to stay here forever, Papa?

02:59:28.460 --> 02:59:29.460
Of course not, moment.

02:59:29.460 --> 02:59:30.460
Don't worry.

02:59:30.460 --> 02:59:31.460
I'll think of something.

02:59:31.460 --> 02:59:32.460
You will, won't you?

02:59:32.460 --> 02:59:34.460
Have you got any ideas?

02:59:34.460 --> 02:59:38.460
Well, not yet, but I am a writer, you know.

02:59:42.460 --> 02:59:44.460
Don't cry, Snorth Maiden.

02:59:44.460 --> 02:59:47.460
I'm sure there won't be only hay to eat.

02:59:47.460 --> 02:59:49.460
I don't mind as long as we're together.

02:59:49.460 --> 02:59:52.460
But what if they put us in separate cages?

02:59:52.460 --> 02:59:53.460
No.

02:59:53.460 --> 02:59:54.460
That would be awful.

02:59:54.460 --> 02:59:56.460
They wouldn't do that.

02:59:57.460 --> 03:00:00.460
Well, perhaps the inspector will come looking for us.

03:00:00.460 --> 03:00:03.460
When he realizes that we've gone as well as the animals,

03:00:03.460 --> 03:00:06.460
he'll bring the full power of the Lord to bear on them.

03:00:06.460 --> 03:00:07.460
Oh, look.

03:00:07.460 --> 03:00:08.460
There's someone coming.

03:00:08.460 --> 03:00:09.460
It's Snorthkin.

03:00:09.460 --> 03:00:10.460
And Hamilun.

03:00:10.460 --> 03:00:11.460
And a little Mai.

03:00:11.460 --> 03:00:12.460
Snorthkin.

03:00:15.460 --> 03:00:16.460
Hi, movement.

03:00:16.460 --> 03:00:17.460
Don't worry.

03:00:17.460 --> 03:00:20.460
We'll have you guys out in just a minute.

03:00:23.460 --> 03:00:24.460
Please come out.

03:00:27.460 --> 03:00:30.460
Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to let you out.

03:00:30.460 --> 03:00:32.460
I'm in charge of this zoo.

03:00:32.460 --> 03:00:34.460
I'm afraid it was quite an understandable mistake.

03:00:34.460 --> 03:00:38.460
But please accept this token of apology from the board of trustees.

03:00:38.460 --> 03:00:39.460
Here you are, madam.

03:00:40.460 --> 03:00:43.460
Mr. Hamilun and I went to the Royal Academy of Science

03:00:43.460 --> 03:00:45.460
just to sort all this out.

03:00:45.460 --> 03:00:47.460
We've been given a letter from the President

03:00:47.460 --> 03:00:49.460
stating that you are not hippos.

03:00:49.460 --> 03:00:52.460
Mr. Hamilun's scientific background helped persuade him.

03:00:52.460 --> 03:00:54.460
So you can all come home now.

03:00:55.460 --> 03:00:59.460
Well, it just goes to show you must never judge by appearances alone.

03:01:02.460 --> 03:01:03.460
Mama.

03:01:03.460 --> 03:01:04.460
Yes, Papa.

03:01:04.460 --> 03:01:07.460
Do you think I should grow a beard?

03:01:07.460 --> 03:01:08.460
No, Papa.

03:01:15.460 --> 03:01:18.460
And so autumn came to Moomin Valley.

03:01:18.460 --> 03:01:22.460
A new season with different weather and different pleasures.

03:01:54.460 --> 03:01:57.460
The Moomin's.

03:01:57.460 --> 03:02:02.460
They love the laughter and they love the living.

03:02:02.460 --> 03:02:05.460
The Moomin's.

03:02:05.460 --> 03:02:13.460
You're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

03:02:13.460 --> 03:02:17.460
They're always happy and goes at play.

03:02:17.460 --> 03:02:20.460
The Moomin's are having fun day after day.

03:02:20.460 --> 03:02:24.460
The Moomin's.

03:02:24.460 --> 03:02:27.460
The Moomin's.

03:02:27.460 --> 03:02:34.460
The Moomin's.

03:02:51.460 --> 03:02:56.460
Here they are for one and all.

03:02:56.460 --> 03:02:59.460
The Moomin's are about to come.

03:02:59.460 --> 03:03:02.460
Come on and sit down here with me.

03:03:02.460 --> 03:03:04.460
Therefore you want your TV.

03:03:04.460 --> 03:03:07.460
They are the Moomin's.

03:03:07.460 --> 03:03:10.460
They are the Moomin's.

03:03:10.460 --> 03:03:13.460
So come with me, give me your hand.

03:03:13.460 --> 03:03:16.460
I'll take you up to a Moomin land.

03:03:16.460 --> 03:03:19.460
You can fly just like a bird.

03:03:19.460 --> 03:03:21.460
Sing that song ever.

03:03:21.460 --> 03:03:24.460
There was the Moomin's.

03:03:24.460 --> 03:03:29.460
There was the Moomin's.

03:03:29.460 --> 03:03:32.460
There was the Moomin's.

03:03:32.460 --> 03:03:37.460
There was the Moomin's.

03:03:37.460 --> 03:03:40.460
There was the Moomin's.

03:03:40.460 --> 03:04:10.460
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

03:04:10.460 --> 03:04:40.460
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

03:04:40.460 --> 03:04:43.180
Oh, I'm just taking my brother his lunch little my

03:04:43.180 --> 03:04:47.020
Hmm. He must have nearly finished the flying ship by now

03:04:47.020 --> 03:04:49.980
Oh, no. Not even snork works that quickly

03:04:51.500 --> 03:04:55.980
Well, have you seen it? No, I haven't. He won't even let me come into his workshop

03:04:55.980 --> 03:04:58.140
Is he afraid it'll disappear if someone sees it?

03:04:58.700 --> 03:05:02.940
He hasn't said why but I suppose all great inventors have to be very careful

03:05:02.940 --> 03:05:04.940
Someone might want to steal their ideas

03:05:05.820 --> 03:05:07.820
Moment told me he's dying to have a look at it

03:05:19.260 --> 03:05:23.420
A moment open the door. I've got my hands fall. Come on quickly

03:05:24.940 --> 03:05:27.340
Look what I've got. It's a runner player

03:05:35.740 --> 03:05:42.540
Do you think you can get it working, do you? Oh, yes, of course, Mama

03:05:42.540 --> 03:05:47.660
Why did people always give me things that are broken? It'd be nice to have something that worked for a change

03:05:51.180 --> 03:05:53.260
Moment, Papa will get it working for you

03:05:53.900 --> 03:05:59.900
My auntie said that the record was all right though. It's dance music. She's had it for ages, but I've never heard it

03:05:59.900 --> 03:06:04.060
Oh, that's nice. It's years since I danced but it seems like only yesterday

03:06:04.540 --> 03:06:10.780
Do you remember what funny was papa dancing? Oh, oh, yeah, I see

03:06:11.660 --> 03:06:13.660
Have you fixed it papa?

03:06:21.740 --> 03:06:25.260
Huh, I can hear music doesn't sound like snuffkin

03:06:34.860 --> 03:06:36.860
Oh

03:06:54.540 --> 03:06:58.380
Right have you got the idea now? Yes, I think so

03:06:59.180 --> 03:07:00.940
Me too

03:07:00.940 --> 03:07:03.420
Come on. Well, let's see you then

03:07:06.060 --> 03:07:08.060
Meal?

03:07:08.860 --> 03:07:10.860
Did it

03:07:11.900 --> 03:07:13.900
Oh, wow

03:07:20.620 --> 03:07:23.580
Look at papa moving. He's a great dancer

03:07:24.220 --> 03:07:26.220
Oh

03:07:33.740 --> 03:07:38.300
Well, then can you dance sniff I've never tried right. Well tried now

03:07:47.500 --> 03:07:49.500
Yep

03:07:53.580 --> 03:07:54.580
One day...

03:07:54.580 --> 03:08:02.120
Пол is there it's quite quick!

03:08:02.120 --> 03:08:10.580
Oh that was fun...

03:08:10.580 --> 03:08:16.180
Uh Dad, Saint Neofer, you still have me out like this?

03:08:16.180 --> 03:08:18.380
You've got no sense of rhythm at all, sneak!

03:08:18.380 --> 03:08:22.840
I can still dance though can I?

03:08:22.840 --> 03:08:24.280
Oh, are you ready, Papa?

03:08:24.280 --> 03:08:26.380
Well, I think I'll have to sit this one out, Mama.

03:08:26.380 --> 03:08:27.220
All right.

03:08:31.400 --> 03:08:33.080
No, Mom, no, thank you.

03:08:33.080 --> 03:08:34.160
I'll dance on my own.

03:08:34.160 --> 03:08:34.960
Well, then.

03:08:34.960 --> 03:08:37.160
Why don't you dance with me and dance, Smith?

03:08:37.160 --> 03:08:38.000
Ah.

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:55.640
Oh, it looks like it's here for the day.

03:08:55.640 --> 03:09:07.280
Oh, what horrible weather, Snuffkin.

03:09:07.280 --> 03:09:09.160
Yes.

03:09:09.160 --> 03:09:10.760
They're having fun.

03:09:10.760 --> 03:09:14.480
Well, Smith brought this old record player over, and we've been dancing.

03:09:14.480 --> 03:09:16.400
I haven't done it for years and years.

03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:18.040
And, well, aren't you coming in?

03:09:18.040 --> 03:09:20.600
I can smell winter in the air, Moomin, Papa.

03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:22.640
Huh?

03:09:22.640 --> 03:09:24.640
Oh, yes, you're right.

03:09:31.840 --> 03:09:33.240
Snuffkin, hi.

03:09:38.280 --> 03:09:41.000
Snuffkin, come and dance with me.

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:42.600
No, thanks, I'm fine.

03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:49.600
Sorry.

03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:51.400
I'm sorry.

03:09:51.400 --> 03:09:59.400
Oh, you.

03:09:59.400 --> 03:10:07.200
Hmm, what's the matter with this, huh?

03:10:07.200 --> 03:10:08.480
I'm afraid it's broken.

03:10:08.480 --> 03:10:10.360
Just when we were having so much fun.

03:10:10.360 --> 03:10:12.920
Will you be able to fix it again, dear?

03:10:12.920 --> 03:10:14.880
No, even I can't mend it now.

03:10:14.880 --> 03:10:17.320
Oh, please, try, Papa, will you?

03:10:17.320 --> 03:10:21.960
Hmm, Snuffkin, do you know anything about record players?

03:10:21.960 --> 03:10:23.120
No, I'm afraid not.

03:10:23.120 --> 03:10:24.080
Oh, dear.

03:10:24.080 --> 03:10:25.560
But what?

03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:28.120
I'll play my harmonic if you want to continue to dance,

03:10:28.120 --> 03:10:30.040
and then you can fiddle around with the machine.

03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:31.240
How would that be?

03:10:31.240 --> 03:10:32.520
Oh, yes, please.

03:10:32.520 --> 03:10:34.040
That'd be great, Snuffkin.

03:10:34.040 --> 03:10:35.320
Thanks.

03:10:35.320 --> 03:10:37.600
Now then, what would be a good tune to dance to?

03:10:37.600 --> 03:10:38.360
Let's see.

03:11:05.320 --> 03:11:17.400
Now what's this, oh, oh, oh, no, I give up.

03:11:17.400 --> 03:11:20.640
May I?

03:11:20.640 --> 03:11:43.960
You're thinking about going away again, aren't you, Snuffkin?

03:11:43.960 --> 03:11:44.960
Hmm.

03:11:44.960 --> 03:11:49.440
I know that you go south every year when winter comes, but I'll still miss you, though,

03:11:49.440 --> 03:11:52.640
and I wish you could stay here in Moomin Valley.

03:11:52.640 --> 03:11:56.440
I know, Moomin.

03:11:56.440 --> 03:12:04.000
Who are they?

03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:05.240
How do you fathomers, I think?

03:12:05.240 --> 03:12:07.240
I wonder where they're going.

03:12:07.240 --> 03:12:08.240
I don't know.

03:12:08.240 --> 03:12:11.240
A deserted island, I expect.

03:12:11.240 --> 03:12:14.960
Probably the best place for them.

03:12:14.960 --> 03:12:16.960
When are you leaving, Snuffkin?

03:12:16.960 --> 03:12:19.120
Oh, I haven't decided yet.

03:12:19.120 --> 03:12:22.720
So you'll be here for a bit longer, then.

03:12:22.720 --> 03:12:24.880
Do you know where you're going?

03:12:24.880 --> 03:12:25.880
No.

03:12:25.880 --> 03:12:27.720
It must be fun traveling.

03:12:27.720 --> 03:12:30.720
Yes, most of the time.

03:12:30.720 --> 03:12:34.120
It's the best way of meeting new people and still being on your own.

03:12:34.120 --> 03:12:38.760
I wish we could do that, but even when we hibernate and go to sleep, we're never really

03:12:38.760 --> 03:12:39.760
alone.

03:12:39.760 --> 03:12:43.560
I guess I'd hibernate too if I had to stay up here in Moomin, during all the freezing

03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:50.840
winter snows.

03:12:50.840 --> 03:12:58.720
Do you think I could go south with Snuffkin, Papa?

03:12:58.720 --> 03:12:59.720
Not really.

03:12:59.720 --> 03:13:02.720
It's the moment way to hibernate.

03:13:02.720 --> 03:13:07.080
It's a family custom passed down through the years by our ancestors.

03:13:07.080 --> 03:13:09.840
But Papa, I don't want to go to sleep for months on end.

03:13:09.840 --> 03:13:12.240
I want to travel south with Snuffkin.

03:13:12.280 --> 03:13:17.320
Oh, Moomin, you promise you'll be back on the first day of spring.

03:13:17.320 --> 03:13:18.520
Oh, Mama!

03:13:18.520 --> 03:13:21.440
Does that mean I can really go?

03:13:21.440 --> 03:13:23.280
I can't wait to tell Snuffkin.

03:13:23.280 --> 03:13:24.760
I can, can't I?

03:13:24.760 --> 03:13:28.080
Well, if you really want to, I don't suppose we'll stop you.

03:13:28.080 --> 03:13:30.280
Will we, Papa?

03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:33.880
Now, my parents didn't mind when I traveled around in my youth.

03:13:33.880 --> 03:13:35.880
So yes, all right, Moomin.

03:13:35.880 --> 03:13:37.480
Oh, thank you, Mama.

03:13:37.480 --> 03:13:40.360
Oh, thank you, Mama.

03:13:40.360 --> 03:13:42.600
That's great, but why won't Snuffkin say?

03:13:50.080 --> 03:13:52.280
Well, it's a good idea.

03:13:52.280 --> 03:13:55.120
And I got to say it'd be fun to have you along, Moomin.

03:13:55.120 --> 03:13:58.520
So I can come with you, Snuffkin?

03:13:58.520 --> 03:13:59.480
No.

03:13:59.480 --> 03:14:00.560
What?

03:14:00.560 --> 03:14:03.720
I'm sorry, but I've got to go on my own.

03:14:03.720 --> 03:14:05.000
Don't be disappointed, Moomin.

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.080
I told you I travel alone.

03:14:07.080 --> 03:14:08.040
I need to.

03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:09.680
After spending the rest of the year here,

03:14:09.680 --> 03:14:12.640
just as I need to be here, after spending the winter alone,

03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:14.640
and the joy of returning to Moomin Valley

03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:16.080
is something I wouldn't miss.

03:14:16.080 --> 03:14:18.360
Which Snuffkin, I thought.

03:14:18.360 --> 03:14:20.160
The time will soon pass, and you'll

03:14:20.160 --> 03:14:22.120
be asleep through most of it.

03:14:22.120 --> 03:14:23.760
You won't notice I'm not here.

03:14:23.760 --> 03:14:26.720
I'll see you next spring, Moomin.

03:14:26.720 --> 03:14:28.800
I'll be back on the first day as usual.

03:14:28.800 --> 03:14:31.600
I promise, as soon as the weather warns.

03:14:31.600 --> 03:14:33.520
And when the flowers start to grow, nothing

03:14:33.520 --> 03:14:35.000
will keep me from Moomin Valley.

03:14:38.560 --> 03:14:41.880
I'm sorry, I didn't work out for you, Moomin.

03:14:41.880 --> 03:14:43.320
Oh, it's all right.

03:14:43.320 --> 03:14:45.760
Oh, come on, Moomin.

03:14:45.760 --> 03:14:47.480
You'll have to tie them a bit tighter than that.

03:15:08.520 --> 03:15:11.280
It'll be a cold winter, so we'll need lots of wood

03:15:11.280 --> 03:15:13.320
to keep us going till spring comes.

03:15:13.320 --> 03:15:14.000
I know.

03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:17.440
Now you want to stay warm, don't you?

03:15:17.440 --> 03:15:20.720
When I grow up, I'll go south for my own, too.

03:15:20.720 --> 03:15:22.560
Yes, of course you will.

03:15:39.040 --> 03:15:41.960
It's Moomin home.

03:15:41.960 --> 03:15:43.920
Yes?

03:15:43.920 --> 03:15:45.080
How is he?

03:15:45.080 --> 03:15:46.960
Is he still down in the dumps?

03:15:46.960 --> 03:15:47.920
I'm afraid so.

03:15:47.920 --> 03:15:50.440
Grandma's cheer you up recipe didn't work.

03:15:50.440 --> 03:15:53.960
Oh, I think he's being silly just because Snuffkin's

03:15:53.960 --> 03:15:54.640
going away.

03:15:54.640 --> 03:15:56.440
I suppose he is.

03:15:56.440 --> 03:15:58.920
But don't worry, Mama.

03:15:58.920 --> 03:16:00.600
He won't be miserable much longer,

03:16:00.600 --> 03:16:02.400
because I've got a surprise for him.

03:16:08.040 --> 03:16:15.040
Are you there, Moomin?

03:16:15.040 --> 03:16:17.040
Oh, Moomin, don't cry.

03:16:17.040 --> 03:16:19.040
Boys don't cry, I suppose.

03:16:19.040 --> 03:16:20.040
Of course they do.

03:16:20.040 --> 03:16:22.040
Well, I'm not crying, so they're...

03:16:22.040 --> 03:16:23.040
All right.

03:16:23.040 --> 03:16:25.040
But I do think you should get up now.

03:16:25.040 --> 03:16:27.040
Oh, and why should I?

03:16:27.040 --> 03:16:29.040
I have a surprise for you.

03:16:29.040 --> 03:16:31.040
I don't want any surprises.

03:16:31.040 --> 03:16:33.040
Oh, Moomin, don't cry.

03:16:33.040 --> 03:16:35.040
Boys don't cry, I suppose.

03:16:35.040 --> 03:16:36.040
Of course they do.

03:16:36.040 --> 03:16:37.040
Well, I'm not crying, so they're...

03:16:37.040 --> 03:16:38.040
They don't want any surprises.

03:16:38.040 --> 03:16:42.040
Come on, I'm going to go and see Snuffkin his workshop.

03:16:42.040 --> 03:16:44.040
But you know he won't let us in.

03:16:44.040 --> 03:16:45.040
I've tried before.

03:16:45.040 --> 03:16:46.040
Oh, yes.

03:16:46.040 --> 03:16:47.040
He will today.

03:16:47.040 --> 03:16:48.040
I promise.

03:16:48.040 --> 03:16:49.040
What?

03:16:49.040 --> 03:16:52.040
You mean Snuffkin shows his flying ship a glass?

03:16:52.040 --> 03:16:53.040
Yes, he says.

03:16:53.040 --> 03:16:55.040
Has he really finished it then?

03:16:55.040 --> 03:16:57.040
No, not yet.

03:16:57.040 --> 03:16:59.040
There's still a lot of work to do on it.

03:16:59.040 --> 03:17:01.040
Then I wonder why he's letting us see it.

03:17:01.040 --> 03:17:03.040
He's always refused before.

03:17:03.040 --> 03:17:05.040
What's made him change his mind?

03:17:05.040 --> 03:17:07.040
But I asked him this time.

03:17:07.040 --> 03:17:09.040
I said I wanted to show it to you.

03:17:09.040 --> 03:17:10.040
It just needed a woman's touch.

03:17:10.040 --> 03:17:12.040
What did you say to him?

03:17:12.040 --> 03:17:14.040
First he said absolutely not.

03:17:14.040 --> 03:17:16.040
But when I told him how ill you were in that

03:17:16.040 --> 03:17:18.040
you probably wouldn't be with us much longer.

03:17:18.040 --> 03:17:20.040
He gave in and said we could see it.

03:17:20.040 --> 03:17:21.040
Just you and me of course.

03:17:21.040 --> 03:17:23.040
I'm not that ill snorke maiden.

03:17:23.040 --> 03:17:24.040
Oh good.

03:17:24.040 --> 03:17:26.040
Because sometimes when people are very depressed

03:17:26.040 --> 03:17:29.040
and just lying bad, they've done something bad.

03:17:29.040 --> 03:17:32.040
Oh stop it snorke maiden, don't say things like that.

03:17:36.040 --> 03:17:38.040
I'm only trying to cheer you up.

03:17:38.040 --> 03:17:40.040
So remember, don't tell us all.

03:17:40.040 --> 03:17:42.040
No one else must know anything about it.

03:17:42.040 --> 03:17:43.040
Okay.

03:17:51.040 --> 03:17:52.040
Let's go.

03:17:53.040 --> 03:17:54.040
No.

03:17:58.040 --> 03:17:59.040
Oh little my.

03:17:59.040 --> 03:18:00.040
Little my.

03:18:00.040 --> 03:18:01.040
Trouble.

03:18:01.040 --> 03:18:02.040
Big Trouble.

03:18:02.040 --> 03:18:03.040
We must fool her.

03:18:03.040 --> 03:18:04.040
Yes but how?

03:18:04.040 --> 03:18:05.040
What can we do?

03:18:06.040 --> 03:18:08.040
I know what we'll do.

03:18:08.040 --> 03:18:09.040
What?

03:18:09.040 --> 03:18:10.040
Quick movement.

03:18:10.040 --> 03:18:13.040
You just agree with everything I say snorke maiden.

03:18:13.040 --> 03:18:14.040
Oh.

03:18:14.040 --> 03:18:17.040
I know what we'll do.

03:18:17.040 --> 03:18:18.040
Quick movement.

03:18:18.040 --> 03:18:21.040
You just agree with everything I say snorke maiden.

03:18:21.040 --> 03:18:22.040
Oh.

03:18:22.040 --> 03:18:25.040
I thought you were in bad movement.

03:18:25.040 --> 03:18:26.040
No.

03:18:26.040 --> 03:18:27.040
We're going to see snorke.

03:18:27.040 --> 03:18:28.040
Yes.

03:18:28.040 --> 03:18:29.040
Really?

03:18:29.040 --> 03:18:30.040
Yes.

03:18:30.040 --> 03:18:32.040
She needs to clear a runway for when the flying ship is finished.

03:18:32.040 --> 03:18:33.040
We're going to help him do it.

03:18:33.040 --> 03:18:34.040
That's all.

03:18:34.040 --> 03:18:35.040
Yes.

03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:36.040
Are you really moving?

03:18:36.040 --> 03:18:38.040
You got out of bed to do that.

03:18:38.040 --> 03:18:41.040
I'm afraid I find it very strange that snorke is asked to go along

03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:44.040
and help him cut down bushes and dig up roots and things.

03:18:44.040 --> 03:18:47.040
You might have noticed I'm not a complete fool.

03:18:47.040 --> 03:18:48.040
But it's true little my.

03:18:48.040 --> 03:18:49.040
Oh, yes.

03:18:49.040 --> 03:18:51.040
Well, at least you could have invented a better lie.

03:18:51.040 --> 03:18:56.040
You must think I'm pretty stupid to believe a pathetic story like that.

03:18:56.040 --> 03:18:57.040
But it's the truth.

03:18:57.040 --> 03:18:59.040
And we need your help.

03:18:59.040 --> 03:19:00.040
Yeah.

03:19:00.040 --> 03:19:01.040
Don't bother, don't bother.

03:19:01.040 --> 03:19:02.040
I don't want to hear anymore.

03:19:02.040 --> 03:19:05.040
I think it's very sad that you have to pretend.

03:19:05.040 --> 03:19:07.040
You're trying to hide something from me.

03:19:07.040 --> 03:19:10.040
And I'm not interested in what sort of sneaky underhanded thing it is.

03:19:10.040 --> 03:19:11.040
But little my.

03:19:11.040 --> 03:19:12.040
No buts.

03:19:12.040 --> 03:19:16.040
And anyway, I'm a little too busy at the moment to take any notice of what's going on.

03:19:16.040 --> 03:19:17.040
Bye.

03:19:17.040 --> 03:19:18.040
Come on.

03:19:18.040 --> 03:19:19.040
Phew.

03:19:19.040 --> 03:19:20.040
That was close.

03:19:20.040 --> 03:19:21.040
Yeah.

03:19:21.040 --> 03:19:22.040
Ha.

03:19:22.040 --> 03:19:23.040
Think, thank you.

03:19:23.040 --> 03:19:26.040
Keep a secret from me, do they?

03:19:26.040 --> 03:19:27.040
Ha.

03:19:27.040 --> 03:19:28.040
Ha.

03:19:28.040 --> 03:19:29.040
Ha.

03:19:29.040 --> 03:19:30.040
Ha.

03:19:30.040 --> 03:19:31.040
Think, thank you.

03:19:31.040 --> 03:19:33.040
Keep a secret from me, do they?

03:19:33.040 --> 03:19:34.040
Ha.

03:19:34.040 --> 03:19:35.040
Ha.

03:19:35.040 --> 03:19:36.040
Ha.

03:19:36.040 --> 03:19:37.040
Ha.

03:19:37.040 --> 03:19:38.040
Ha.

03:19:38.040 --> 03:19:39.040
Ha.

03:19:39.040 --> 03:19:40.040
Ha.

03:19:40.040 --> 03:19:41.040
Ha.

03:19:41.040 --> 03:19:42.040
Ha.

03:19:42.040 --> 03:19:43.040
Ha.

03:19:43.040 --> 03:19:44.040
Ha.

03:19:44.040 --> 03:19:45.040
Ha.

03:19:45.040 --> 03:19:46.040
Of course we are.

03:19:46.040 --> 03:19:49.040
I promised, didn't I?

03:19:49.040 --> 03:19:52.040
Come in, then.

03:19:52.040 --> 03:19:59.040
Wow.

03:19:59.040 --> 03:20:08.040
It's nearly ready, isn't it?

03:20:08.040 --> 03:20:10.040
Oh no, there's a lot more to do.

03:20:10.040 --> 03:20:12.040
The machine isn't half finished yet.

03:20:12.040 --> 03:20:19.040
And as you can see, there's a lot to do on the ship itself, but I'm getting there slowly.

03:20:19.040 --> 03:20:23.040
I never thought it would be so fantastic, smork.

03:20:23.040 --> 03:20:28.040
Well, I suppose you could say the design wasn't a complete failure.

03:20:28.040 --> 03:20:31.040
I'm quite sure it'll fly beautifully.

03:20:31.040 --> 03:20:32.040
Oh, thank you.

03:20:32.040 --> 03:20:35.040
Do you really think it will, woman?

03:20:35.040 --> 03:20:36.040
I can see it now.

03:20:36.040 --> 03:20:41.040
High up in the air, dodging in and out of the clouds, way up above the world.

03:20:41.040 --> 03:20:45.040
Well, I'm glad to see that you're so perceptive and quite right.

03:20:45.040 --> 03:20:47.040
Oh, how very thoughtful of me.

03:20:47.040 --> 03:20:49.040
Shouldn't you sit down and rest?

03:20:49.040 --> 03:20:50.040
You know, you're illness.

03:20:50.040 --> 03:20:52.040
It doesn't help to get too excited.

03:20:52.040 --> 03:20:53.040
Ha.

03:20:53.040 --> 03:20:54.040
I shouldn't worry, Snork.

03:20:54.040 --> 03:20:56.040
There's nothing wrong with him.

03:20:56.040 --> 03:20:59.040
Oh, little my.

03:20:59.040 --> 03:21:00.040
How did you get in here?

03:21:00.040 --> 03:21:02.040
Throw that door.

03:21:02.040 --> 03:21:03.040
But I always keep it.

03:21:03.040 --> 03:21:06.040
Oh, oh, oh, no.

03:21:06.040 --> 03:21:09.040
I must have forgotten to lock it.

03:21:09.040 --> 03:21:12.040
And it's a bit late to do it now, isn't it?

03:21:12.040 --> 03:21:13.040
But don't worry.

03:21:13.040 --> 03:21:16.040
If I wanted to get in, I'd get in locks or no locks.

03:21:16.040 --> 03:21:18.040
Oh, you lied to us, little my.

03:21:18.040 --> 03:21:19.040
Of course, but so did you.

03:21:19.040 --> 03:21:21.040
Telling me that stupid story.

03:21:21.040 --> 03:21:23.040
Now we're even, right?

03:21:23.040 --> 03:21:25.040
Now, listen, little my.

03:21:25.040 --> 03:21:27.040
Don't ever tell anybody what you see over here.

03:21:27.040 --> 03:21:29.040
All right.

03:21:29.040 --> 03:21:31.040
Ha.

03:21:31.040 --> 03:21:38.040
This invention contains so many outstanding new features it is difficult to know where to begin.

03:21:39.040 --> 03:21:48.040
But let me start with the most exciting part of the whole construction.

03:21:48.040 --> 03:21:58.040
It began as a dream or rather the concept of a dream, thrilling, beautiful, impossible, dangerous.

03:22:09.040 --> 03:22:11.040
Oh.

03:22:23.040 --> 03:22:25.040
Can you take the ship down, movement?

03:22:25.040 --> 03:22:28.040
I'd like you to land at that side of the lake.

03:22:28.040 --> 03:22:30.040
Oh, why do you want to get off?

03:22:30.040 --> 03:22:33.040
Aren't you having fun flying about up here?

03:22:33.040 --> 03:22:35.040
I want to be on my own.

03:22:35.040 --> 03:22:37.040
Oh, please stay here.

03:22:37.040 --> 03:22:39.040
I'll let you steer if you want.

03:22:39.040 --> 03:22:41.040
No, really, movement, please.

03:22:41.040 --> 03:22:43.040
Bye now.

03:22:43.040 --> 03:22:45.040
No!

03:22:48.040 --> 03:22:51.040
Snuff me!

03:22:54.040 --> 03:22:56.040
Ugh!

03:23:08.040 --> 03:23:10.040
So long then, movement, my friend.

03:23:10.040 --> 03:23:12.040
I'll see you again next year.

03:23:12.040 --> 03:23:15.040
The first day of spring.

03:23:38.040 --> 03:23:41.040
Goodbye, then, Snuffkin.

03:24:02.040 --> 03:24:04.040
Off for the winter, Asian Afghan.

03:24:04.040 --> 03:24:05.040
Yes.

03:24:05.040 --> 03:24:06.040
Goodbye, Mr. Hemilan.

03:24:06.040 --> 03:24:09.040
We'll be seeing you in the spring.

03:24:09.040 --> 03:24:12.040
Yes, when the snows are gone.

03:24:18.040 --> 03:24:22.040
Oh, to be young and follow the sun wherever it goes.

03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:25.040
And so the snow fell, and winter came to movement valley.

03:24:25.040 --> 03:24:28.040
And in movement's hearts, Snuffkin and the spring

03:24:28.040 --> 03:24:31.040
seemed a long, long way away.

03:24:31.040 --> 03:24:36.040
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living,

03:24:36.040 --> 03:24:38.040
the woman.

03:24:38.040 --> 03:24:41.040
And so the snow fell, and winter came to movement valley.

03:24:41.040 --> 03:24:44.040
And in movement's hearts, Snuffkin and the spring

03:24:44.040 --> 03:24:47.040
seemed a long, long way away.

03:24:47.040 --> 03:24:50.040
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living,

03:24:50.040 --> 03:24:53.040
the woman.

03:24:53.040 --> 03:24:57.040
Believing in sharing and caring and giving,

03:24:57.040 --> 03:25:01.040
the woman.

03:25:01.040 --> 03:25:05.040
They're always happy, and always at play.

03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:08.040
The women are having fun day after day.

03:25:08.040 --> 03:25:12.040
The woman.

03:25:12.040 --> 03:25:16.040
The woman.

03:25:16.040 --> 03:25:19.040
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living,

03:25:19.040 --> 03:25:23.040
the woman.

03:25:23.040 --> 03:25:27.040
Believing in sharing and caring and giving,

03:25:27.040 --> 03:25:31.040
the woman.

03:25:31.040 --> 03:25:34.040
They're always happy, and always at play.

03:25:34.040 --> 03:25:38.040
The women are having fun day after day.

03:25:38.040 --> 03:25:42.040
The woman.

03:25:42.040 --> 03:25:45.040
The woman.

03:25:45.040 --> 03:25:52.040
The woman.

03:26:10.040 --> 03:26:13.040
Here they are for one another.

03:26:13.040 --> 03:26:16.040
The movements are about to come.

03:26:16.040 --> 03:26:19.040
Come on and sit down here with me.

03:26:19.040 --> 03:26:22.040
Here for you on your TV.

03:26:22.040 --> 03:26:25.040
They are the movements.

03:26:25.040 --> 03:26:28.040
They are the movements.

03:26:28.040 --> 03:26:31.040
So come with me, give me your hand.

03:26:31.040 --> 03:26:34.040
I'll take you up to a moment land.

03:26:34.040 --> 03:26:37.040
You can fly just like a bird.

03:26:37.040 --> 03:26:39.040
Sing that song ever.

03:26:39.040 --> 03:26:42.040
There were the movements.

03:26:42.040 --> 03:26:49.040
There were the movements.

03:26:49.040 --> 03:26:56.040
There were the movements.

03:26:56.040 --> 03:27:26.040
Bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat

03:27:56.040 --> 03:28:01.120
on everything, waiting until they all wake up again at the first day of spring and start

03:28:01.120 --> 03:28:08.080
to get everything in movement house clean and ready for the coming summer.

03:28:08.080 --> 03:28:19.040
But what's this?

03:28:19.040 --> 03:28:22.920
It looks like movement as restless as if something has disturbed him.

03:28:22.920 --> 03:28:32.440
I wonder what he was dreaming about.

03:28:32.440 --> 03:28:37.680
I wonder what time it is.

03:28:37.680 --> 03:28:41.320
Oh, it's nearly 20 after two.

03:28:41.320 --> 03:28:44.600
Wonder whether it's morning or afternoon.

03:28:44.600 --> 03:28:46.720
It doesn't really matter, I suppose.

03:28:46.720 --> 03:28:47.720
Oh, it stopped.

03:28:53.320 --> 03:28:55.800
Oh, it's frozen.

03:28:55.800 --> 03:28:59.920
It looks really dark out there.

03:29:13.320 --> 03:29:17.520
Mama, Mama, please wake up.

03:29:17.520 --> 03:29:26.160
Papa, Papa, Mama, Mama, Mama, what's wrong with me?

03:29:26.160 --> 03:29:28.160
I feel way too weak.

03:29:28.160 --> 03:29:52.160
It's very odd, I don't usually wake up when I'm hibernating.

03:29:52.160 --> 03:30:07.160
Oh, dear, the whole house is buried in snow.

03:30:07.160 --> 03:30:37.160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

03:30:37.160 --> 03:30:48.040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

03:31:07.160 --> 03:31:22.760
what was that perhaps I better go home no what's the matter with me everyone's

03:31:22.760 --> 03:31:28.160
asleep and the furniture's all covered up and movements don't give up

03:31:37.160 --> 03:31:45.080
I wish Northkin were here he's probably in the far south where it's warm and

03:31:45.080 --> 03:31:47.400
sunny

03:32:08.160 --> 03:32:12.160
I wonder what that is

03:32:12.160 --> 03:32:14.160
oh

03:32:34.060 --> 03:32:36.960
that sounds like

03:32:36.960 --> 03:32:41.200
Oh, he has his little mind.

03:32:41.200 --> 03:32:44.240
By the bobo, what are you doing here, Moomin?

03:32:44.240 --> 03:32:45.760
What am I doing here?

03:32:45.760 --> 03:32:50.440
I heard strange noises and came to see what it was, then you crashed into me like an avalanche

03:32:50.440 --> 03:32:52.360
and I've just lifted the box off you.

03:32:52.360 --> 03:32:53.960
Oh, don't be stupid, Moomin.

03:32:53.960 --> 03:32:57.600
I mean, why are you out in the snow and not hibernating like the others?

03:32:57.600 --> 03:32:58.960
Spring's not for ages.

03:32:58.960 --> 03:33:00.680
Oh, I don't know.

03:33:00.680 --> 03:33:03.240
I just woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.

03:33:03.320 --> 03:33:07.160
What about you, sliding about like that, you should be asleep too.

03:33:07.160 --> 03:33:09.560
Yes, I should, but I just woke up as well.

03:33:09.560 --> 03:33:11.000
Probably to look after you.

03:33:11.000 --> 03:33:14.200
I tried to wake my stupid sister, but she kept on snoring.

03:33:14.200 --> 03:33:16.520
But I think this snow is really great.

03:33:16.520 --> 03:33:17.800
Well, I don't.

03:33:17.800 --> 03:33:23.160
It's cold, it's slippy, much too bright, and it's everywhere and far too quiet.

03:33:23.160 --> 03:33:24.920
I saw the grok.

03:33:24.920 --> 03:33:26.280
Huh?

03:33:26.280 --> 03:33:28.840
That horrible freezing monster?

03:33:28.840 --> 03:33:32.920
She should feel at home in this and there's no point in her trying to freeze anything.

03:33:32.920 --> 03:33:34.440
I saw her on the hill.

03:33:34.440 --> 03:33:36.200
Then it was her voice, I heard.

03:33:36.200 --> 03:33:39.080
Yes, and the trouble with the horrid thing is that she's so cold,

03:33:39.080 --> 03:33:41.480
I wouldn't even want to touch her, Moomin.

03:33:41.480 --> 03:33:42.280
Huh?

03:33:42.280 --> 03:33:43.160
It's her!

03:33:53.160 --> 03:33:55.000
I'm getting cold shivers all over.

03:33:55.000 --> 03:33:57.160
Well, why do you expect in the snow?

03:33:57.160 --> 03:33:58.520
No, it's the grok's fault.

03:33:58.520 --> 03:33:59.320
She's done it.

03:33:59.320 --> 03:34:01.640
Look at my skin, it's all goose bumpy.

03:34:01.720 --> 03:34:05.800
It's not like that in the summer, it's smooth, not lumpy.

03:34:05.800 --> 03:34:09.480
It's not the snow that makes me feel so cold, it's her staring at me.

03:34:09.480 --> 03:34:10.200
I'm scared.

03:34:18.920 --> 03:34:20.280
That was great.

03:34:20.280 --> 03:34:21.320
Good, isn't it?

03:34:21.320 --> 03:34:22.920
You can have as much as you like.

03:34:22.920 --> 03:34:25.080
We picked more raspberries than ever this year,

03:34:25.080 --> 03:34:27.400
and Mama made lots of juice.

03:34:27.400 --> 03:34:28.680
Thanks.

03:34:28.680 --> 03:34:30.200
Oh.

03:34:30.440 --> 03:34:32.280
Ah, I want that.

03:34:34.200 --> 03:34:35.880
Mama's silver tray?

03:34:35.880 --> 03:34:36.360
Yeah.

03:34:36.360 --> 03:34:37.720
What do you want it for?

03:34:37.720 --> 03:34:40.600
To slide on the snow with a coarse stupid.

03:34:40.600 --> 03:34:43.240
But it's a sort of family treasure in heirloom.

03:34:43.240 --> 03:34:46.360
Well, you never use it and it's so shiny.

03:34:46.360 --> 03:34:49.480
It'll make a great sled and go really fast.

03:34:55.800 --> 03:34:58.120
Doesn't look like they'll wake up till spring.

03:34:58.120 --> 03:35:00.120
They're lucky, they're still sleeping.

03:35:00.120 --> 03:35:02.600
I think it's very unfair that I woke up like this.

03:35:06.280 --> 03:35:08.120
So, what should we do now?

03:35:08.120 --> 03:35:10.040
I want to go look at the sea.

03:35:10.040 --> 03:35:11.240
Good idea.

03:35:11.240 --> 03:35:12.920
At least that won't be covered in snow.

03:35:26.520 --> 03:35:28.760
I bet the great cold was just like this.

03:35:30.840 --> 03:35:34.600
Oh, no.

03:35:34.600 --> 03:35:35.560
What's the matter?

03:35:35.560 --> 03:35:36.840
I forgot the tray.

03:35:36.840 --> 03:35:37.560
Never mind.

03:35:37.560 --> 03:35:39.800
You couldn't use it as a boat anyway, it would sink.

03:35:40.440 --> 03:35:41.480
Yes, you could.

03:35:41.480 --> 03:35:41.960
What?

03:35:41.960 --> 03:35:42.440
How?

03:35:42.440 --> 03:35:43.320
Oh, look.

03:35:43.320 --> 03:35:44.200
There's the sink.

03:35:51.240 --> 03:35:52.920
But it's all frozen.

03:35:52.920 --> 03:35:54.600
So we'll be able to slide on it.

03:35:56.280 --> 03:35:57.480
What's that over there?

03:36:00.360 --> 03:36:01.320
It's forgotten.

03:36:23.800 --> 03:36:24.760
Sorry.

03:36:25.800 --> 03:36:26.120
Let go.

03:36:26.120 --> 03:36:27.440
Oh, no.

03:36:27.440 --> 03:36:28.440
Oh, hold on.

03:36:28.440 --> 03:36:30.440
Hello, you, too.

03:36:32.440 --> 03:36:34.440
You're not hibernating, either?

03:36:34.440 --> 03:36:38.440
Oh, no. I haven't got time to spend four months sleeping.

03:36:38.440 --> 03:36:42.440
Why not? Little May and I just woke up and now we don't know what to do.

03:36:42.440 --> 03:36:44.440
I'm sure you can think of something.

03:36:44.440 --> 03:36:45.440
Who's supposed to?

03:36:45.440 --> 03:36:48.440
I've never seen the sea frozen before.

03:36:48.440 --> 03:36:50.440
Did you make that horse too ticky?

03:36:50.440 --> 03:36:52.440
Yes, I did. Can I sit on it?

03:36:52.440 --> 03:36:55.440
No, you can't. I need it for the lady of the cold.

03:36:55.440 --> 03:36:57.440
Oh, I see.

03:36:57.440 --> 03:36:59.440
I suppose you've heard of her.

03:36:59.440 --> 03:37:03.440
Yes, she's very beautiful, but if she looks into your eyes, you're turned into a block of ice.

03:37:03.440 --> 03:37:05.440
She's not a very nice lady.

03:37:05.440 --> 03:37:09.440
That's right, Little May and Spring can never come while she's here. It waits for her to go.

03:37:09.440 --> 03:37:13.440
Oh, I see. And are you hoping she'll ride away on this horse, then?

03:37:15.440 --> 03:37:17.440
Yes, and it will take her back to the north,

03:37:17.440 --> 03:37:21.440
where she stays until she comes here again next winter and drives the sun away.

03:37:21.440 --> 03:37:25.440
The horse doesn't look very solid to me, too, Tiki.

03:37:25.440 --> 03:37:31.440
That's why I'm going to pour water over it when it gets really cold, and then it'll freeze solid.

03:37:31.440 --> 03:37:33.440
When is the lady of the cold coming?

03:37:33.440 --> 03:37:39.440
You can never tell, but soon, tonight, perhaps, it feels much colder already.

03:37:39.440 --> 03:37:41.440
What's happened to the sun, Tiki?

03:37:41.440 --> 03:37:43.440
Do you know when the sun will come back again?

03:37:43.440 --> 03:37:45.440
Uh-당히.

03:37:45.440 --> 03:37:51.440
It's in the south, shining on snuffkin, but it'll be back soon, and then it will stay a bit longer each day.

03:37:51.440 --> 03:37:53.440
Good, I can't wait.

03:37:53.440 --> 03:37:55.440
Now, I'll wait for it.

03:37:55.440 --> 03:37:57.440
If you don't come back, it's a good thing to do.

03:37:57.440 --> 03:37:59.440
What's happened to the sun, Tiki?

03:37:59.440 --> 03:38:01.440
Do you know when the sun will come back again?

03:38:01.440 --> 03:38:03.440
It's in the south, shining on snuffkin.

03:38:03.440 --> 03:38:07.440
But it'll be back soon, and then it will stay a bit longer each day.

03:38:07.440 --> 03:38:13.240
Good I can't wait. Now there'll be a full moon tonight and we'll be able to see everything.

03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:16.640
Great! I can get my tray out. I can't wait to try it on the sea.

03:38:16.640 --> 03:38:18.440
What do you mean, your tray?

03:38:18.440 --> 03:38:23.940
Well, let's move in, Mama's tray, but I'm using it. I'm going to put a sail on it and slide across the ice.

03:38:23.940 --> 03:38:25.440
Why not wait till tomorrow?

03:38:25.440 --> 03:38:29.440
Wait until tomorrow? No. When I want to do something, I do it now.

03:38:29.440 --> 03:38:32.440
What if the ice suddenly melts or something?

03:38:33.440 --> 03:38:34.440
It...

03:38:35.440 --> 03:38:36.440
Yeah!

03:38:37.440 --> 03:38:42.440
I like it here. It's warm and cozy. I hope Moomin Papa doesn't mind me using it.

03:38:42.440 --> 03:38:48.440
This is Papa's bathhouse. He built it himself and he'd be very glad to know you're using it.

03:38:48.440 --> 03:38:51.440
It's great. The windowpains are different colors.

03:38:51.440 --> 03:38:56.440
If you look out through one, the world is red and through another one, the world is green.

03:39:08.440 --> 03:39:15.440
Oh, you don't hibernate either, do you? Now Scram! The horrible lady of the cold is coming and if she looks you in the eye, you'll turn to ice!

03:39:15.440 --> 03:39:17.440
Go on! Go away!

03:39:18.440 --> 03:39:19.440
Moomin!

03:39:35.440 --> 03:39:37.440
Moomin! Toothiggy!

03:39:38.440 --> 03:39:39.440
Moomin!

03:39:41.440 --> 03:39:44.440
Moomin! Toothiggy, why you?

03:39:44.440 --> 03:39:46.440
Little Mike, we're over here, huh?

03:39:48.440 --> 03:39:50.440
Why are you doing down there?

03:39:50.440 --> 03:39:53.440
Don't take his trying to catch some fish!

03:39:53.440 --> 03:39:56.440
If she does, she's gonna cook us some dinner!

03:39:56.440 --> 03:39:59.440
Right! I've got to get sailing, man!

03:39:59.440 --> 03:40:02.440
I'd better go see what she's doing to Mom and Silver Trey.

03:40:02.440 --> 03:40:03.440
Okay.

03:40:06.440 --> 03:40:08.440
Ah, got one.

03:40:14.440 --> 03:40:16.440
Oh dear, me.

03:40:18.440 --> 03:40:21.440
Mmm, it's cold and wet under that ice.

03:40:21.440 --> 03:40:23.440
How are you doing, little Mike?

03:40:23.440 --> 03:40:25.440
Very well, thank you.

03:40:26.440 --> 03:40:29.440
How can you get under the ice anyway?

03:40:29.440 --> 03:40:32.440
I guess the water must be low and there's a gap left there.

03:40:32.440 --> 03:40:33.440
Oh, how?

03:40:33.440 --> 03:40:38.440
I don't know, but perhaps the tide was in when the sea froze and some of it got stuck to the shore.

03:40:38.440 --> 03:40:41.440
Oh, I suppose it's possible.

03:40:41.440 --> 03:40:46.440
Doothiggy told me that she has fish soup every day in the wintertime.

03:40:48.440 --> 03:40:52.440
I know. I'll go see if the horse is frozen yet.

03:40:52.440 --> 03:40:54.440
Make sure you shut the door behind you.

03:40:54.440 --> 03:40:56.440
Oh, my thumb!

03:41:05.440 --> 03:41:08.440
Mmm, I don't think it's hard enough yet.

03:41:08.440 --> 03:41:11.440
I'll collapse if the lady if the cold gets on it now.

03:41:15.440 --> 03:41:18.440
Oh, it's getting colder and colder!

03:41:39.440 --> 03:41:41.440
The Grooke.

03:41:44.440 --> 03:41:47.440
Don't tell me you want to ride the horse.

03:41:49.440 --> 03:41:52.440
I don't think you'd better.

03:41:52.440 --> 03:41:55.440
This is for the lady of the cold, you know.

03:41:57.440 --> 03:41:59.440
There's no telling what she'd do to you.

03:41:59.440 --> 03:42:02.440
Look you in the eye, probably.

03:42:09.440 --> 03:42:11.440
Even the Grooke is frightened of the lady of the cold.

03:42:19.440 --> 03:42:22.440
Ah, now it looks frozen.

03:42:25.440 --> 03:42:27.440
Wee!

03:42:31.440 --> 03:42:33.440
Wee!

03:42:34.440 --> 03:42:35.440
Ha!

03:42:37.440 --> 03:42:39.440
Great, isn't it, movement?

03:42:39.440 --> 03:42:41.440
Yeah, that old tree really moves.

03:42:41.440 --> 03:42:42.440
Want to go?

03:42:42.440 --> 03:42:44.440
No thanks, I'm too big.

03:42:44.440 --> 03:42:48.440
Come on now, the fish soup is ready and it's time you were inside, little my.

03:42:48.440 --> 03:42:50.440
Keep it warm for me, I'm having another go.

03:42:50.440 --> 03:42:51.440
No, little my.

03:42:52.440 --> 03:42:53.440
Why not?

03:42:53.440 --> 03:42:57.440
Have you forgotten what I told you the lady of the cold may be coming?

03:42:57.440 --> 03:42:58.440
Oh.

03:42:58.440 --> 03:43:00.440
Well, I want to see her, I'm not scared of her.

03:43:00.440 --> 03:43:02.440
I'll be moving so fast she won't get a chance.

03:43:02.440 --> 03:43:05.440
No, now listen to me, little my.

03:43:05.440 --> 03:43:08.440
All you have to do is not let her look you in the eye.

03:43:08.440 --> 03:43:12.440
But what happens if you're not quick enough and she catches you before you turn away?

03:43:12.440 --> 03:43:16.440
I know, if we watch her from the bathhouse, she won't see us.

03:43:20.440 --> 03:43:21.440
Please, little my.

03:43:21.440 --> 03:43:23.440
Come in, she's almost here.

03:43:23.440 --> 03:43:25.440
We can watch her from inside.

03:43:25.440 --> 03:43:32.440
That's no good, I want to see her properly.

03:43:32.440 --> 03:43:33.440
No, little my.

03:43:33.440 --> 03:43:34.440
Don't go.

03:43:39.440 --> 03:43:41.440
Come back, little my.

03:43:44.440 --> 03:43:45.440
Oh dear.

03:43:45.440 --> 03:43:48.440
Come on, let's get back in the cabin before it's too late.

03:43:48.440 --> 03:43:50.440
Weeee.

03:43:50.440 --> 03:43:53.440
No, no, no, no.

03:43:56.440 --> 03:43:59.440
No, no, no, no.

03:44:03.440 --> 03:44:05.440
Oh, the lady of the cold.

03:44:06.440 --> 03:44:10.440
No, no, no.

03:44:13.440 --> 03:44:18.440
No, no, no.

03:44:20.440 --> 03:44:27.440
I saw her face, I saw her face.

03:44:27.440 --> 03:44:31.440
I saw her and she didn't turn away to eye.

03:44:31.440 --> 03:44:34.440
Trust little my to get away with it.

03:44:34.440 --> 03:44:37.440
I don't know how she does it.

03:44:37.440 --> 03:44:39.440
I think her nerves are made of steel.

03:44:39.440 --> 03:44:41.440
I hope she's alright.

03:44:41.440 --> 03:44:42.440
She's fine.

03:44:42.440 --> 03:44:43.440
She's fine.

03:44:43.440 --> 03:44:45.440
I don't know how she does it.

03:44:45.440 --> 03:44:47.440
I think her nerves are made of steel.

03:44:47.440 --> 03:44:49.440
I hope she's alright.

03:44:49.440 --> 03:44:53.440
She should try not to make so much noise out there.

03:44:53.440 --> 03:44:55.440
Oh dear.

03:44:55.440 --> 03:44:59.440
You are home.

03:44:59.440 --> 03:45:09.440
Oh dear.

03:45:09.440 --> 03:45:17.440
Oh dear.

03:45:17.440 --> 03:45:25.440
Oh dear.

03:45:25.440 --> 03:45:32.440
Oh dear.

03:45:32.440 --> 03:45:40.440
Oh dear.

03:45:40.440 --> 03:45:43.440
Yeah, I know her face.

03:45:43.440 --> 03:45:47.440
I know her face.

03:45:47.440 --> 03:45:53.440
Oh.

03:45:53.440 --> 03:46:00.440
Oh.

03:46:00.440 --> 03:46:06.440
Oh dear.

03:46:06.440 --> 03:46:10.440
Oh dear.

03:46:10.440 --> 03:46:17.440
Little boy.

03:46:17.440 --> 03:46:22.440
Oh.

03:46:22.440 --> 03:46:29.440
Oh.

03:46:29.440 --> 03:46:36.440
Oh.

03:46:37.440 --> 03:46:43.440
Oh.

03:46:43.440 --> 03:46:50.440
Oh.

03:46:59.440 --> 03:47:05.440
Little boy.

03:47:07.440 --> 03:47:09.440
Little my.

03:47:09.440 --> 03:47:12.440
Come on, please.

03:47:12.440 --> 03:47:18.440
Wake up, please.

03:47:18.440 --> 03:47:21.440
Oh, please don't stay frozen, little my.

03:47:21.440 --> 03:47:22.440
Don't worry, little my.

03:47:22.440 --> 03:47:23.440
We'll thought you out.

03:47:23.440 --> 03:47:24.440
Don't worry.

03:47:24.440 --> 03:47:31.440
It's nice and warm here.

03:47:37.440 --> 03:47:41.440
Ow, that's hot moment.

03:47:41.440 --> 03:47:43.440
Praise the ball, Bob.

03:47:43.440 --> 03:47:48.440
You come back.

03:47:48.440 --> 03:47:52.440
So little my came back from the cold, little the worst for wear.

03:47:52.440 --> 03:47:54.440
Movement need not have worried.

03:47:54.440 --> 03:48:03.440
For the little my's in this world are practically indestructible.

03:48:03.440 --> 03:48:10.440
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

03:48:10.440 --> 03:48:18.440
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

03:48:18.440 --> 03:48:22.440
They're always happy and always at play.

03:48:22.440 --> 03:48:29.440
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

03:48:29.440 --> 03:48:36.440
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

03:48:36.440 --> 03:48:43.440
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

03:48:43.440 --> 03:48:48.440
They're always happy and always at play.

03:48:48.440 --> 03:48:55.440
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

03:48:55.440 --> 03:49:02.440
The movements, the movements.

03:49:02.440 --> 03:49:09.440
The movements.

03:49:25.440 --> 03:49:30.440
Here they are for one and all.

03:49:30.440 --> 03:49:33.440
The movements are about to come.

03:49:33.440 --> 03:49:36.440
Come on and sit down here with me.

03:49:36.440 --> 03:49:38.440
They're here for you on your TV.

03:49:38.440 --> 03:49:41.440
They are the movements.

03:49:41.440 --> 03:49:44.440
They are the movements.

03:49:44.440 --> 03:49:47.440
So come with me, give me your hand.

03:49:47.440 --> 03:49:50.440
I'll take you up to a movement land.

03:49:50.440 --> 03:49:53.440
You can fly just like a bird.

03:49:53.440 --> 03:49:56.440
Sing that song ever.

03:49:56.440 --> 03:49:59.440
There were the movements.

03:49:59.440 --> 03:50:02.440
There were the movements.

03:50:02.440 --> 03:50:05.440
There were the movements.

03:50:05.440 --> 03:50:08.440
There were the movements.

03:50:08.440 --> 03:50:11.440
There were the movements.

03:50:11.440 --> 03:50:14.440
There were the movements.

03:50:14.440 --> 03:50:44.440
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

03:50:44.440 --> 03:51:06.940
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba ...

03:51:06.940 --> 03:51:11.260
little my woke up in the middle of it. I couldn't get back to sleep.

03:51:11.260 --> 03:51:17.260
Ah, this is great. I'm really starving. I hope there's lots.

03:51:17.260 --> 03:51:21.500
Oh, there's plenty left. Mama thought she'd made too much this year, but it's lucky for

03:51:21.500 --> 03:51:24.900
us she did. I don't know what we'd have had to eat otherwise.

03:51:24.900 --> 03:51:36.580
Shh, they're still sleeping. Well at least you got me to play with

03:51:36.580 --> 03:51:38.580
Moomin.

03:51:56.180 --> 03:52:01.220
That was fun. Why don't you have a go, Moomin? I'm probably a bit heavy for it.

03:52:01.220 --> 03:52:05.900
So get something else, dummy. I might later. Anyway, I thought we were going to see

03:52:05.900 --> 03:52:11.020
you too, Tiki. Come on, I'll pull you. Okay.

03:52:14.220 --> 03:52:19.260
I know why you don't want to go, Moomin. You're scared of sliding down from the top, aren't you?

03:52:19.260 --> 03:52:22.460
No, of course I'm not.

03:52:29.340 --> 03:52:34.300
Tiki's not here. I wonder where she's gone too. That's her over there, isn't it?

03:52:34.300 --> 03:52:38.220
Oh, yeah, I think it is.

03:52:38.220 --> 03:52:41.500
Jane Moomin, she looks like she's sliding.

03:52:41.500 --> 03:52:45.500
Sliding? Yes, it's obvious. She's sliding, of course.

03:52:45.500 --> 03:52:48.700
She's coming over.

03:52:49.980 --> 03:52:52.300
What were you doing out there, Tiki?

03:52:52.300 --> 03:52:57.260
Watching the sun go down. It's the only place you can see it from. I just caught it for

03:52:57.260 --> 03:53:02.140
it disappeared over the horizon. Where did it go to? It comes up again in the south and will

03:53:02.140 --> 03:53:06.540
probably shine on snuffkin. Hey, Tiki, what are those things you got on your feet?

03:53:07.340 --> 03:53:11.500
They're called skates, and they're the best thing possible for moving across the ice quickly.

03:53:12.140 --> 03:53:15.820
Just what I need. Come on, show me how to do it. Yes, okay?

03:53:19.020 --> 03:53:25.900
That's great. I'm going to make myself some skates, too. It's not as easy as you think, little lie.

03:53:25.900 --> 03:53:30.460
Pathetic. All you need is a sword and knife on your shoes, and that sounds easy enough to me.

03:53:32.300 --> 03:53:41.340
You know, it's strange, but I've got a funny kind of feeling that there's someone else, apart from us, in the bathhouse.

03:53:41.340 --> 03:53:44.540
Hmm, well, there it is. Who is it? Where are they?

03:53:46.540 --> 03:53:48.220
Little lie. You can't see them.

03:53:48.860 --> 03:53:52.860
Ha, what do you mean I can't see them? Where are they hiding in the cupboard?

03:53:52.860 --> 03:53:55.980
No, they're invisible. Look, I'll show you.

03:54:02.780 --> 03:54:07.180
Oh, oh, there's something on my head! See, that's two of the shoe mice.

03:54:07.180 --> 03:54:10.620
They're eight of them all together. Now, don't walk on the little lie.

03:54:14.540 --> 03:54:19.580
I didn't see any shoe mice here in the summer, although if they're invisible, I wouldn't have done.

03:54:20.220 --> 03:54:26.220
No, probably not, as in the summer when we come across new little animals that we've never seen before,

03:54:26.220 --> 03:54:29.900
and who likes snuffkin, go away when the wind and snow comes.

03:54:30.540 --> 03:54:36.700
Then, when the days are shorter and everyone else is hibernating, they come out, and some are so shy

03:54:36.700 --> 03:54:40.380
they're invisible, dear. I'm afraid I don't understand winter at all.

03:54:41.100 --> 03:54:45.660
Well, of course you don't. You moments have always slept through and don't know very much about it.

03:54:46.700 --> 03:54:51.020
Oh, I can't wait to tell Mum or Papa about all this. They'll be really amazed.

03:54:51.100 --> 03:54:52.860
Oh!

03:54:56.860 --> 03:54:57.420
Moomin!

03:54:58.380 --> 03:54:59.020
What is it?

03:54:59.660 --> 03:55:01.660
We will wake up tomorrow, won't we, Moomin?

03:55:02.220 --> 03:55:04.060
I'm sure we will. Why?

03:55:04.060 --> 03:55:07.180
I just don't want to go on sleeping and sleeping until spring.

03:55:07.500 --> 03:55:09.500
Well, we woke up today so…

03:55:09.500 --> 03:55:11.500
But we don't know about tomorrow!

03:55:11.500 --> 03:55:14.300
No, of course not. We'll have to wait and see.

03:55:14.300 --> 03:55:17.580
If we're awake, we'll know, and if we're asleep, then it doesn't matter.

03:55:17.580 --> 03:55:22.580
Well, if I'm not awake and you are, wake me up, okay, Moomin?

03:55:22.580 --> 03:55:24.580
Yes, all right. Go to sleep now.

03:55:24.580 --> 03:55:27.580
What if it's the other way around, Moomin?

03:55:27.580 --> 03:55:30.580
Well, what if I wake up and you're still fast asleep?

03:55:30.580 --> 03:55:35.580
I don't mind sleeping all winter. Now stop talking to me, my.

03:55:35.580 --> 03:55:37.580
You'd better wake me up, or else.

03:55:47.580 --> 03:55:57.580
Hey, little mind. Or have you gone to?

03:55:58.580 --> 03:56:04.580
Hey, little mind. Or have you gone to?

03:56:14.580 --> 03:56:16.580
Oh!

03:56:16.580 --> 03:56:21.580
Hello! Well, well, wonderful place for skiing you've got here.

03:56:21.580 --> 03:56:24.580
What are those funny things on your feet?

03:56:25.580 --> 03:56:27.580
Hey, what? You're joking.

03:56:27.580 --> 03:56:29.580
You mean you really don't know what these are?

03:56:29.580 --> 03:56:31.580
That's why I'm asking you.

03:56:31.580 --> 03:56:34.580
Well, they're skis, didn't you see me come down?

03:56:34.580 --> 03:56:38.580
Yes, I did. Can you slide on the ice with these and go just as fast?

03:56:38.580 --> 03:56:41.580
Oh no, on ice, you have to use skates.

03:56:41.580 --> 03:56:43.580
What is that, young lady?

03:56:43.580 --> 03:56:47.580
Oh, it's a snowboard. You slide on the snow with it.

03:56:55.580 --> 03:57:00.580
Oh, that's not bad, but it's only a silver tray, isn't it?

03:57:00.580 --> 03:57:01.580
That's right, mister.

03:57:01.580 --> 03:57:02.580
I'll teach you to ski.

03:57:02.580 --> 03:57:04.580
No, thank you. I'll learn by watching you.

03:57:04.580 --> 03:57:05.580
Won't take me long at all.

03:57:05.580 --> 03:57:08.580
I'm afraid skiing is not that easy, young lady.

03:57:08.580 --> 03:57:10.580
Don't worry. It won't be for me.

03:57:10.580 --> 03:57:13.580
Everything is once I decide to do it.

03:57:14.580 --> 03:57:15.580
Epee!

03:57:21.580 --> 03:57:24.580
Oh, so you spend all year going where the snow is?

03:57:24.580 --> 03:57:25.580
That must be tiring.

03:57:25.580 --> 03:57:28.580
Not at all. Life should be a struggle.

03:57:28.580 --> 03:57:30.580
This jam is really good.

03:57:30.580 --> 03:57:34.580
Does it always have to be winter, catch a struggle in spring and summer instead?

03:57:34.580 --> 03:57:36.580
Well, no, that would be too easy.

03:57:36.580 --> 03:57:38.580
You could just sit back and relax.

03:57:38.580 --> 03:57:42.580
No, you've got to face up to the cold and exercise to keep warm.

03:57:42.580 --> 03:57:45.580
Oh, that sounds very interesting, Mr. Brisk.

03:57:45.580 --> 03:57:51.580
One clear cold bath a day keeps all those unnecessary thoughts away.

03:57:51.580 --> 03:57:53.580
My own little poem.

03:57:53.580 --> 03:57:56.580
What? You don't mean you swim in this weather, do you?

03:57:56.580 --> 03:57:59.580
The water must be very close to freezing.

03:57:59.580 --> 03:58:02.580
Well, the sea is a lot colder than that. It is frozen.

03:58:02.580 --> 03:58:03.580
Is there a river?

03:58:03.580 --> 03:58:07.580
Yes, there is, but the water looks very, very cold.

03:58:07.580 --> 03:58:09.580
Sounds just right.

03:58:10.580 --> 03:58:14.580
Have you got any more of this wonderful jam? It's delicious.

03:58:14.580 --> 03:58:19.580
There's some more in the cellar, but we've got cranberry up here if you'd like that.

03:58:19.580 --> 03:58:22.580
No, thanks. This will do for now.

03:58:22.580 --> 03:58:26.580
I'd appreciate some after my daily swim. It'll work up an appetite.

03:58:32.580 --> 03:58:34.580
Oh, this is great.

03:58:35.580 --> 03:58:38.580
I can hardly watch. It makes me shiver all over.

03:58:38.580 --> 03:58:41.580
Is everybody like you? Where you come from?

03:58:41.580 --> 03:58:44.580
I'm personally not. Why did you join me?

03:58:44.580 --> 03:58:46.580
No, thank you.

03:58:48.580 --> 03:58:51.580
Hello? What are you two looking at?

03:58:51.580 --> 03:58:52.580
Huh?

03:58:53.580 --> 03:58:55.580
Oh, hello there, little dog.

03:58:55.580 --> 03:58:58.580
We're watching that madman down there.

03:58:59.580 --> 03:59:01.580
He looks like he's swimming.

03:59:01.580 --> 03:59:04.580
Moon Valley is full of very odd people.

03:59:04.580 --> 03:59:07.580
He's not from Moon Valley as a matter of fact.

03:59:07.580 --> 03:59:09.580
Who are you?

03:59:09.580 --> 03:59:12.580
I'm sorry, and I'm looking for my brothers.

03:59:12.580 --> 03:59:15.580
I don't suppose you've seen them, have you?

03:59:15.580 --> 03:59:18.580
Your brothers? Have you lost them?

03:59:18.580 --> 03:59:21.580
Are they hibernating somewhere, do you think?

03:59:21.580 --> 03:59:24.580
Oh, no, not them. They never do that.

03:59:24.580 --> 03:59:27.580
Well, everyone else in Moon Valley is hibernating.

03:59:27.580 --> 03:59:30.580
Except little Mai here, now too ticky, and the invisible mice.

03:59:30.580 --> 03:59:33.580
Me? Oh, and that crazy person down in the middle.

03:59:37.580 --> 03:59:39.580
Oh, yeah!

03:59:44.580 --> 03:59:47.580
My brothers are up in the Lonely Mountains. Is that far from here?

03:59:47.580 --> 03:59:49.580
No, not far.

03:59:49.580 --> 03:59:53.580
Lonely Mountains. I know there are wolves up there, but I never heard of any dogs.

03:59:54.580 --> 03:59:57.580
Well, wolves and dogs are brothers, didn't you know?

04:00:01.580 --> 04:00:06.580
Oh, you know, this tastes even better after an invigorating swim.

04:00:06.580 --> 04:00:09.580
That's my favorite jam, much nicer than cranberry.

04:00:09.580 --> 04:00:11.580
Oh, I agree.

04:00:13.580 --> 04:00:16.580
And doggie, now don't you want your jam?

04:00:16.580 --> 04:00:18.580
What? No, you haven't.

04:00:18.580 --> 04:00:20.580
Oh, thank you.

04:00:20.580 --> 04:00:23.580
Oh, you look as though you're a bit worried about something.

04:00:23.580 --> 04:00:25.580
Yes, I suppose I am.

04:00:25.580 --> 04:00:27.580
Worried spat?

04:00:27.580 --> 04:00:29.580
Put it out of your mind.

04:00:29.580 --> 04:00:34.580
Why do you think your brothers are wolves? Did someone tell you they were?

04:00:34.580 --> 04:00:37.580
Of course they are. Everyone knows that.

04:00:37.580 --> 04:00:39.580
And besides, I can feel the wolf in me.

04:00:39.580 --> 04:00:42.580
Well, you might feel it, but nobody can see it for a star.

04:00:42.580 --> 04:00:44.580
Wolves are much bigger than you.

04:00:44.580 --> 04:00:46.580
I want to go and find them, and then we can all hell at the moon.

04:00:46.580 --> 04:00:48.580
I've been practicing.

04:00:48.580 --> 04:00:51.580
I can see why he wants to be a wolf, but we'd better keep him here.

04:00:51.580 --> 04:00:54.580
He could get her if he goes up there on his own.

04:00:54.580 --> 04:00:57.580
You don't really want to live with wolves, do you?

04:00:57.580 --> 04:00:59.580
Oh, I do very much.

04:00:59.580 --> 04:01:01.580
Why don't you travel around with me, sorry, you?

04:01:01.580 --> 04:01:05.580
I've got little dogs. They could be your brothers and sisters if you want.

04:01:05.580 --> 04:01:06.580
Well, I don't know.

04:01:06.580 --> 04:01:09.580
Look, I'm going to stay here and move in valley for a while,

04:01:09.580 --> 04:01:11.580
and we can become great friends.

04:01:11.580 --> 04:01:13.580
You're going to stay here?

04:01:13.580 --> 04:01:16.580
Yes, marvelous slopes, fine swimming, the most wonderful jam,

04:01:16.580 --> 04:01:18.580
and I'll build myself an igloo.

04:01:18.580 --> 04:01:20.580
An igloo? You mean a house made of snow?

04:01:20.580 --> 04:01:22.580
Yes, that's exactly.

04:01:22.580 --> 04:01:26.580
If it's alright with you, I'll take this jam with me, just to keep me going.

04:01:44.580 --> 04:01:48.580
Hello there. Can I borrow your spade for a minute, Mr. Brisk?

04:01:48.580 --> 04:01:50.580
Of course. What for, my friend?

04:01:50.580 --> 04:01:52.580
I want to break up this barrel.

04:01:52.580 --> 04:01:55.580
Oh, that's easy. Allow me, little mind.

04:01:55.580 --> 04:01:58.580
Here, here, here.

04:01:58.580 --> 04:02:01.580
How's that young lady?

04:02:05.580 --> 04:02:09.580
Mr. Brisk really loves this jam. He can't stop eating it.

04:02:09.580 --> 04:02:13.580
Well, it's very nice, Moomin. I can't imagine anyone not liking it.

04:02:13.580 --> 04:02:15.580
Do you know how to ski to a tiki?

04:02:15.580 --> 04:02:18.580
Well, of course I do. I just haven't done it yet.

04:02:18.580 --> 04:02:22.580
Mr. Brisk says that he's going to teach me.

04:02:22.580 --> 04:02:23.580
Oh.

04:02:25.580 --> 04:02:28.580
I can't move my legs tied up like this.

04:02:28.580 --> 04:02:32.580
That's the whole point. You don't have to. You just move your skis. He's his winking.

04:02:33.580 --> 04:02:35.580
No, no, no.

04:02:38.580 --> 04:02:41.580
First of all, you have to learn how to fall properly.

04:02:41.580 --> 04:02:45.580
Well, then if I learn to ski first, then I won't fall.

04:02:51.580 --> 04:02:53.580
Little mind has skis, too.

04:02:53.580 --> 04:02:57.580
Oh, they're just made from an old barrel. You're too much more sophisticated.

04:02:57.580 --> 04:03:01.580
Now, an advantage in ease and lean forward. Are you ready?

04:03:01.580 --> 04:03:06.580
I don't think I like this. It's too steep. Can I practice on something a bit flatter?

04:03:06.580 --> 04:03:10.580
Well, maybe next time. Now then, I'll have a few rolls.

04:03:22.580 --> 04:03:25.580
Trying to start an avalanche, Moomin?

04:03:25.580 --> 04:03:28.580
You know, I think this hill is even steeper than the last one.

04:03:28.580 --> 04:03:31.580
There's nothing to worry about. You've already mastered falling down.

04:03:31.580 --> 04:03:32.580
Have you gone in?

04:03:43.580 --> 04:03:44.580
Oh, stop it, please.

04:03:44.580 --> 04:03:46.580
You can do it yourself. Just calm down.

04:03:52.580 --> 04:03:55.580
Oh, look at that. Marvelous. You need it.

04:03:56.580 --> 04:03:59.580
Please, someone stop me, please.

04:04:03.580 --> 04:04:06.580
That was terrific, Moomin. Let's do it again.

04:04:16.580 --> 04:04:18.580
What are you looking at, sorry, you?

04:04:18.580 --> 04:04:20.580
I can hear all my brothers howling out there.

04:04:20.580 --> 04:04:22.580
They're probably hungry and looking for food.

04:04:22.580 --> 04:04:25.580
No, I know they're calling me.

04:04:25.580 --> 04:04:29.580
I'm going to see them. I've really got to, Moomin.

04:04:43.580 --> 04:04:45.580
Got anything? No, not yet.

04:04:45.580 --> 04:04:49.580
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble. We're running out of jam.

04:04:50.580 --> 04:04:52.580
Mr. Bresch, I suppose.

04:04:52.580 --> 04:04:54.580
You can't stop eating it.

04:04:54.580 --> 04:04:56.580
Well, you have to ask him to leave.

04:04:56.580 --> 04:04:57.580
I can't do that.

04:04:57.580 --> 04:05:01.580
Well, of course you can. It's your home and you can choose who you have.

04:05:12.580 --> 04:05:15.580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

04:05:15.580 --> 04:05:18.580
Usually, a sign that spring is not far away.

04:05:20.580 --> 04:05:22.580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

04:05:22.580 --> 04:05:25.580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

04:05:25.580 --> 04:05:27.580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

04:05:27.580 --> 04:05:29.580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

04:05:29.580 --> 04:05:31.580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

04:05:31.580 --> 04:05:33.580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

04:05:33.580 --> 04:05:35.580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

04:05:35.580 --> 04:05:37.580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

04:05:37.580 --> 04:05:40.580
A snowstorm.

04:06:08.580 --> 04:06:10.580
Hello, Moomin.

04:06:10.580 --> 04:06:13.580
Oh, hello, Mr. Bresch.

04:06:13.580 --> 04:06:16.580
Look, I'm sorry, but all the jam's gone.

04:06:16.580 --> 04:06:18.580
I'm just an empty jar.

04:06:18.580 --> 04:06:20.580
Oh, well, never mind. It was a great jam.

04:06:20.580 --> 04:06:23.580
But I have more important things on my mind.

04:06:23.580 --> 04:06:27.580
You see, now that spring is here, I have to leave, Moomin Valley.

04:06:27.580 --> 04:06:30.580
Oh, do you?

04:06:30.580 --> 04:06:34.580
Hmm, it's sad, but there you are. I have to go.

04:06:34.580 --> 04:06:36.580
Goodbye, Moomin.

04:06:36.580 --> 04:06:38.580
Goodbye, then, Mr. Bresch.

04:06:38.580 --> 04:06:40.580
Keep some jam for me.

04:07:07.580 --> 04:07:09.580
Hello, I'm sorry. I'm your brother.

04:07:09.580 --> 04:07:12.580
I've wanted to be with you for a long, long time.

04:07:12.580 --> 04:07:15.580
I'm afraid I'm not very brave or strong, but if you'd let me stay with you.

04:07:15.580 --> 04:07:18.580
Oh, don't you know me?

04:07:18.580 --> 04:07:21.580
Looks like I was wrong.

04:07:21.580 --> 04:07:23.580
Oh, well, go on.

04:07:23.580 --> 04:07:26.580
Eat me if you want to.

04:07:26.580 --> 04:07:31.580
It's a pity I didn't sleep at night instead of learning to howl.

04:07:31.580 --> 04:07:35.580
Moomin was right. I shouldn't have come.

04:08:27.580 --> 04:08:31.580
Oh, hello, little buggy. What are you doing here?

04:08:31.580 --> 04:08:35.580
Have you been waiting for me?

04:08:35.580 --> 04:08:39.580
We'll have a great time traveling around the world together.

04:08:40.580 --> 04:08:54.580
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

04:08:54.580 --> 04:09:07.580
Diverdi! Diverdi! Diverdi!

04:09:24.580 --> 04:09:29.580
That was spring breaking through the ice.

04:09:29.580 --> 04:09:32.580
Look at the theme moment, it's free again.

04:09:32.580 --> 04:09:34.580
Will Little Mike get back?

04:09:34.580 --> 04:09:35.580
Oh.

04:09:35.580 --> 04:09:37.580
Oh my goodness.

04:09:55.580 --> 04:09:58.580
Little Mike, hang on to me.

04:09:58.580 --> 04:09:59.580
Thank you, Movement.

04:09:59.580 --> 04:10:01.580
Let's go.

04:10:01.580 --> 04:10:02.580
It's all right, Movement.

04:10:02.580 --> 04:10:04.580
Don't panic, I'm with you.

04:10:04.580 --> 04:10:05.580
You're okay.

04:10:05.580 --> 04:10:06.580
Oh.

04:10:06.580 --> 04:10:07.580
Oh.

04:10:07.580 --> 04:10:08.580
Oh.

04:10:08.580 --> 04:10:09.580
Oh.

04:10:09.580 --> 04:10:10.580
Oh.

04:10:10.580 --> 04:10:11.580
Oh.

04:10:11.580 --> 04:10:12.580
Oh.

04:10:12.580 --> 04:10:13.580
Oh.

04:10:13.580 --> 04:10:14.580
Oh.

04:10:14.580 --> 04:10:15.580
Oh.

04:10:15.580 --> 04:10:16.580
Oh.

04:10:16.580 --> 04:10:17.580
Oh.

04:10:17.580 --> 04:10:18.580
Oh.

04:10:18.580 --> 04:10:19.580
Oh.

04:10:19.580 --> 04:10:20.580
Oh.

04:10:20.580 --> 04:10:21.580
Oh.

04:10:21.580 --> 04:10:22.580
Oh.

04:10:22.580 --> 04:10:23.580
Oh.

04:10:23.580 --> 04:10:24.580
Oh.

04:10:24.580 --> 04:10:26.580
Over there, Movement.

04:10:26.580 --> 04:10:27.580
Quick, do.

04:10:27.580 --> 04:10:33.580
See, if you knew what I'd tell you, there's nothing to be afraid of.

04:10:33.580 --> 04:10:34.580
Just trust me, Movement.

04:10:34.580 --> 04:10:36.580
I'm always right, aren't I?

04:10:36.580 --> 04:10:43.580
Yes, I know you are, Little Mike, but we'd still better hurry.

04:10:43.580 --> 04:10:50.580
Come on, you two just a bit further.

04:10:51.580 --> 04:10:52.580
Uh-oh.

04:10:52.580 --> 04:10:53.580
No.

04:10:53.580 --> 04:10:55.580
Wow.

04:10:55.580 --> 04:10:58.580
Oh, it's cold in here.

04:10:58.580 --> 04:11:00.580
Quickly, let's get inside and light a fire.

04:11:00.580 --> 04:11:02.580
You'll soon warm up.

04:11:05.580 --> 04:11:07.580
Shoot.

04:11:12.580 --> 04:11:16.580
And so Mr. Brisk and the ice both left Woman Valley.

04:11:16.580 --> 04:11:23.580
And spring returned once more after a long and eventful winter.

04:11:23.580 --> 04:11:30.580
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

04:11:30.580 --> 04:11:37.580
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:11:37.580 --> 04:11:41.580
They're always happy and always at play.

04:11:41.580 --> 04:11:48.580
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

04:11:48.580 --> 04:11:52.580
The movements.

04:11:52.580 --> 04:11:59.580
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

04:11:59.580 --> 04:12:07.580
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:12:07.580 --> 04:12:10.580
They're always happy and always at play.

04:12:10.580 --> 04:12:17.580
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

04:12:17.580 --> 04:12:21.580
The movements.

04:12:21.580 --> 04:12:27.580
The movements.

04:12:37.580 --> 04:12:49.580
Here they are for one and all.

04:12:49.580 --> 04:12:52.580
The movements are about to come.

04:12:52.580 --> 04:12:55.580
Come on and sit down here with me.

04:12:55.580 --> 04:12:58.580
They're here for you on your TV.

04:12:58.580 --> 04:13:01.580
They are the movements.

04:13:01.580 --> 04:13:04.580
They are the movements.

04:13:04.580 --> 04:13:07.580
They'll come with me, give me your hand.

04:13:07.580 --> 04:13:10.580
I'll take you up to a moment land.

04:13:10.580 --> 04:13:13.580
You can fly just like a bird.

04:13:13.580 --> 04:13:15.580
Sing that song ever.

04:13:15.580 --> 04:13:18.580
There were the movements.

04:13:18.580 --> 04:13:21.580
There were the movements.

04:13:21.580 --> 04:13:24.580
There were the movements.

04:13:24.580 --> 04:13:27.580
There were the movements.

04:13:27.580 --> 04:13:30.580
There were the movements.

04:13:30.580 --> 04:13:33.580
There were the movements.

04:13:33.580 --> 04:14:03.580
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

04:14:03.580 --> 04:14:33.580
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

04:14:33.580 --> 04:14:36.580
and enjoying the sunshine and the flowers.

04:14:38.080 --> 04:14:40.580
Everyone that is except for Mumen

04:14:40.580 --> 04:14:43.580
was in bed with a terrible cold.

04:14:56.580 --> 04:14:59.580
Oh dear, Mumen, that's a nasty cough.

04:14:59.580 --> 04:15:01.580
My throat is very sore.

04:15:01.580 --> 04:15:03.580
Ah, this will help soothe it.

04:15:03.580 --> 04:15:05.580
It's one of grandma's best potions.

04:15:09.580 --> 04:15:10.580
It's hard.

04:15:10.580 --> 04:15:13.580
Never mind. Nice tasting medicines don't always work as well.

04:15:16.580 --> 04:15:18.580
I wanted to go out, it's spring.

04:15:19.580 --> 04:15:22.580
I know dear, but you'd catch pneumonia or something.

04:15:23.580 --> 04:15:24.580
Mama?

04:15:25.580 --> 04:15:28.580
Does anyone know why snuffkin hasn't come back yet?

04:15:29.580 --> 04:15:33.580
No, perhaps spring came earlier this year and he wasn't ready.

04:15:37.580 --> 04:15:39.580
Snuffkin had always come back to Mumen Valley

04:15:39.580 --> 04:15:41.580
on the very first day of spring.

04:15:42.580 --> 04:15:43.580
But not this year.

04:15:48.580 --> 04:15:49.580
Snuffkin.

04:15:49.580 --> 04:15:50.580
Mumen.

04:15:56.580 --> 04:15:59.580
I'm Mumen Papa, is Mumen any better?

04:15:59.580 --> 04:16:02.580
No, I'm a Fred not, he's still got a nasty cough.

04:16:02.580 --> 04:16:03.580
Can I go up and see him?

04:16:03.580 --> 04:16:05.580
No, you'd better not, you might catch it.

04:16:10.580 --> 04:16:11.580
Papa's right, Snuffkin.

04:16:11.580 --> 04:16:13.580
You know how poorly you get when you're ill.

04:16:13.580 --> 04:16:15.580
It's best not to take the risk.

04:16:15.580 --> 04:16:17.580
I should think he'll be up and about before very long.

04:16:17.580 --> 04:16:20.580
Yes, it's better to be safe than sorry.

04:16:20.580 --> 04:16:23.580
Mumen shouldn't have gone out in the winter, should he, Mama?

04:16:24.580 --> 04:16:26.580
No, but he couldn't go back to sleep.

04:16:26.580 --> 04:16:29.580
Snow would have that effect on anyone.

04:16:29.580 --> 04:16:33.580
Not you, little Mai was out in the cold with him and look at her.

04:16:33.580 --> 04:16:35.580
She seems healthy enough.

04:16:37.580 --> 04:16:39.580
I'll take these flowers to Mumen later.

04:16:39.580 --> 04:16:42.580
Little Mai's too small to catch a cold.

04:16:48.580 --> 04:16:50.580
This is boring.

04:16:50.580 --> 04:16:52.580
I can't believe that Mumen's sick.

04:16:52.580 --> 04:16:55.580
And Snuffkin's not back either.

04:16:55.580 --> 04:16:57.580
I sure wonder what's happened to him.

04:16:57.580 --> 04:17:01.580
I bet you Mumen gets better as soon as Snuffkin arrives in Mumen Valley.

04:17:01.580 --> 04:17:04.580
He's never been this late coming back before.

04:17:04.580 --> 04:17:07.580
Perhaps he's got better with you guys.

04:17:07.580 --> 04:17:10.580
Impossible, he's very fond of me.

04:17:10.580 --> 04:17:12.580
He's told me so lots of times.

04:17:12.580 --> 04:17:14.580
He likes Mumen too, of course.

04:17:14.580 --> 04:17:17.580
He might have been captured by a highwayman.

04:17:18.580 --> 04:17:20.580
Let's go and look for him.

04:17:20.580 --> 04:17:21.580
A highwayman?

04:17:21.580 --> 04:17:23.580
First Snuffkin, Silly.

04:17:23.580 --> 04:17:25.580
He's got to come back so Mumen will get better.

04:17:25.580 --> 04:17:26.580
We must find him.

04:17:26.580 --> 04:17:28.580
But where do we look, Snork Maiden?

04:17:28.580 --> 04:17:29.580
In the south.

04:17:29.580 --> 04:17:32.580
It's a big place. He could be anywhere.

04:17:32.580 --> 04:17:35.580
Well, I don't care how big it is I'm going anywhere.

04:17:35.580 --> 04:17:36.580
You're being silly.

04:17:36.580 --> 04:17:37.580
No, I'm not.

04:17:37.580 --> 04:17:39.580
I don't think your brother will like it.

04:17:39.580 --> 04:17:41.580
In fact, I know he won't.

04:17:41.580 --> 04:17:44.580
Have you gone completely bananas?

04:17:44.580 --> 04:17:45.580
No, I haven't.

04:17:45.580 --> 04:17:47.580
And you'll just have to make your own muffins.

04:17:47.580 --> 04:17:49.580
There's more to food than muffins.

04:17:49.580 --> 04:17:51.580
I was speaking figuratively.

04:17:51.580 --> 04:17:53.580
Anyway, I'm going, dear brother.

04:17:53.580 --> 04:17:56.580
And nothing you can do or say will stop me.

04:17:56.580 --> 04:17:57.580
It's for Mumen.

04:17:57.580 --> 04:17:59.580
That's a sort of hairbrain scheme

04:17:59.580 --> 04:18:01.580
that could only have been dreamed up by you.

04:18:01.580 --> 04:18:02.580
What good will it do?

04:18:02.580 --> 04:18:04.580
You don't even know where he is.

04:18:04.580 --> 04:18:07.580
It is not. Mumen is pining for Snuffkin.

04:18:07.580 --> 04:18:08.580
Rubbish.

04:18:08.580 --> 04:18:10.580
Men don't pine for their friends.

04:18:10.580 --> 04:18:12.580
If he isn't back yet, then he isn't coming.

04:18:12.580 --> 04:18:15.580
And if he isn't going to come, what's the point of looking for him?

04:18:15.580 --> 04:18:17.580
You won't find him anyway.

04:18:19.580 --> 04:18:22.580
He will come when he knows that Mumen is sick.

04:18:22.580 --> 04:18:24.580
Black males just like a sister.

04:18:24.580 --> 04:18:27.580
Something done for love could never be black male.

04:18:27.580 --> 04:18:29.580
Oh no, you're not going and that's fine.

04:18:29.580 --> 04:18:32.580
Look, why don't you and little Mai go by yourselves?

04:18:32.580 --> 04:18:35.580
Well, I didn't really make a definite decision.

04:18:35.580 --> 04:18:37.580
I just sort of said that I might come along,

04:18:37.580 --> 04:18:39.580
but if Snort Maiden isn't going,

04:18:39.580 --> 04:18:41.580
then there doesn't seem any point, does there?

04:18:41.580 --> 04:18:44.580
And I'm not going because I think it's stupid and hairbrain, too.

04:18:44.580 --> 04:18:46.580
Snuffkin will come back soon.

04:18:46.580 --> 04:18:47.580
Not Snort Maiden.

04:18:47.580 --> 04:18:49.580
What do you say to that?

04:18:49.580 --> 04:18:52.580
How is Mumen feeling any better?

04:18:52.580 --> 04:18:55.580
He's asleep now, but the cough doesn't seem so bad.

04:18:55.580 --> 04:18:57.580
And is temperature still there?

04:18:57.580 --> 04:18:58.580
Yes, it is.

04:18:58.580 --> 04:18:59.580
And is temperature still there?

04:18:59.580 --> 04:19:00.580
Yes, it is.

04:19:00.580 --> 04:19:01.580
And is temperature still there?

04:19:01.580 --> 04:19:02.580
Yes, it is.

04:19:02.580 --> 04:19:03.580
Yes, it is.

04:19:03.580 --> 04:19:04.580
It doesn't seem so bad.

04:19:04.580 --> 04:19:07.580
And is temperature still quite high?

04:19:34.580 --> 04:19:35.580
Snuffkin!

04:19:39.580 --> 04:19:40.580
Snuffkin!

04:19:51.580 --> 04:19:53.580
Am I pleased to see you, Mumen?

04:19:53.580 --> 04:19:55.580
You look like you needed a lift.

04:19:55.580 --> 04:19:58.580
This magic cloud must be one of those we got

04:19:58.580 --> 04:20:00.580
from the Hobgoblins top hat.

04:20:00.580 --> 04:20:01.580
That's right.

04:20:01.580 --> 04:20:02.580
I had one of them away.

04:20:02.580 --> 04:20:04.580
What a good idea, Mumen.

04:20:04.580 --> 04:20:05.580
You are clever.

04:20:05.580 --> 04:20:08.580
Well, it was so much fun the last time, wasn't it?

04:20:08.580 --> 04:20:09.580
Hi, Mumen!

04:20:09.580 --> 04:20:10.580
Hi!

04:20:10.580 --> 04:20:12.580
Oh, look, Snuffkin.

04:20:12.580 --> 04:20:14.580
I didn't know they were here, too.

04:20:20.580 --> 04:20:21.580
Snuffkin!

04:20:25.580 --> 04:20:26.580
Mumen!

04:20:26.580 --> 04:20:28.580
Snuffkin!

04:20:29.580 --> 04:20:33.580
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

04:20:37.580 --> 04:20:39.580
Not just a dream.

04:20:39.580 --> 04:20:40.580
Snuffkin!

04:20:47.580 --> 04:20:49.580
You look blousy, Mumen.

04:20:49.580 --> 04:20:50.580
Oh, thanks, stinky.

04:20:50.580 --> 04:20:52.580
You'd better keep away.

04:20:52.580 --> 04:20:54.580
There's no need, bugs, and things like that.

04:20:54.580 --> 04:20:55.580
Stay away from me.

04:20:55.580 --> 04:20:57.580
They're probably frightened of someone so healthy.

04:20:58.580 --> 04:21:00.580
Mama isn't letting anyone in here.

04:21:00.580 --> 04:21:01.580
It's very dull.

04:21:01.580 --> 04:21:02.580
You followed a bed or something?

04:21:02.580 --> 04:21:03.580
Yes, I did.

04:21:03.580 --> 04:21:04.580
I know.

04:21:04.580 --> 04:21:06.580
You were dreaming, weren't you?

04:21:06.580 --> 04:21:08.580
Unfortunately, yes.

04:21:08.580 --> 04:21:10.580
I know how you feel.

04:21:10.580 --> 04:21:12.580
I have that dream a lot.

04:21:12.580 --> 04:21:15.580
Oh, you stand on a windowsill,

04:21:15.580 --> 04:21:17.580
getting ready to break the glass,

04:21:17.580 --> 04:21:19.580
and inside there's diamonds.

04:21:19.580 --> 04:21:20.580
And then, moment, you fall.

04:21:20.580 --> 04:21:23.580
It's not the same dream at all, stinky.

04:21:23.580 --> 04:21:25.580
Snuffkin hasn't come back yet.

04:21:25.580 --> 04:21:26.580
Have you heard anything from him?

04:21:26.580 --> 04:21:27.580
He's very late.

04:21:27.580 --> 04:21:28.580
Oh, Snuffkin.

04:21:29.580 --> 04:21:30.580
Huh.

04:21:30.580 --> 04:21:31.580
You know something, don't you?

04:21:31.580 --> 04:21:33.580
All I know is that he went away

04:21:33.580 --> 04:21:34.580
as usual last autumn.

04:21:34.580 --> 04:21:35.580
It hasn't come back yet.

04:21:35.580 --> 04:21:36.580
And then...

04:21:36.580 --> 04:21:37.580
Yes, what?

04:21:37.580 --> 04:21:39.580
Snork Maiden wanted to go looking for him

04:21:39.580 --> 04:21:42.580
because she thinks that if Snuffkin comes back,

04:21:42.580 --> 04:21:43.580
you won't be sick anymore.

04:21:43.580 --> 04:21:45.580
But Snork wouldn't let her.

04:21:45.580 --> 04:21:47.580
Snork Maiden?

04:21:50.580 --> 04:21:52.580
Hey, Snork Maiden!

04:21:52.580 --> 04:21:54.580
Snork Maiden!

04:21:57.580 --> 04:21:59.580
You're not serious, are you?

04:21:59.580 --> 04:22:01.580
I feel perfectly all right.

04:22:01.580 --> 04:22:03.580
You look like that's warmed up, if you ask me.

04:22:03.580 --> 04:22:05.580
Thanks a lot.

04:22:05.580 --> 04:22:09.580
Now, stinky, tell me which way does Snuffkin normally travel south?

04:22:09.580 --> 04:22:11.580
Hey, are you going looking for him?

04:22:11.580 --> 04:22:14.580
Yes, it's not really spring in Moomin Valley

04:22:14.580 --> 04:22:15.580
if he's not around.

04:22:15.580 --> 04:22:17.580
It's just not right somehow.

04:22:17.580 --> 04:22:20.580
Okay, you're all as mad as each other.

04:22:20.580 --> 04:22:22.580
But you'll help me?

04:22:22.580 --> 04:22:24.580
I've got to try and find him, stinky.

04:22:24.580 --> 04:22:27.580
Yes, all right, but don't tell your parents I helped you.

04:22:27.580 --> 04:22:29.580
Don't worry, I won't say a thing.

04:22:49.580 --> 04:22:51.580
Sorry, stinky. Are you okay?

04:22:51.580 --> 04:22:53.580
No, I'm fine.

04:22:54.580 --> 04:22:56.580
Here's your lunch, Moomin.

04:22:56.580 --> 04:22:58.580
How are you feeling?

04:22:58.580 --> 04:23:00.580
Moomin?

04:23:00.580 --> 04:23:03.580
Papa, come here quickly.

04:23:06.580 --> 04:23:09.580
Oh, Papa, Moomin's gone. He's not in his bed.

04:23:09.580 --> 04:23:12.580
Not in his bed? Are you sure, Mama?

04:23:12.580 --> 04:23:17.580
Of course I am. His room is empty and there's no sign of him.

04:23:17.580 --> 04:23:19.580
Perhaps he's in one of the other rooms.

04:23:19.580 --> 04:23:21.580
Don't worry, Mama, I'll find him.

04:23:24.580 --> 04:23:28.580
Yo, Moomin.

04:23:28.580 --> 04:23:31.580
Moomin.

04:23:31.580 --> 04:23:33.580
Hi, Moomin, Papa.

04:23:33.580 --> 04:23:34.580
Oh, little Mai.

04:23:34.580 --> 04:23:36.580
What's wrong? You look worried.

04:23:36.580 --> 04:23:38.580
A moment's gone off somewhere.

04:23:38.580 --> 04:23:41.580
I expect you must have gone to look for Snuffkin.

04:23:41.580 --> 04:23:43.580
Snuffkin?

04:23:43.580 --> 04:23:46.580
Well, you know how crazy Moomin is about him.

04:23:46.580 --> 04:23:48.580
It's stupid if you ask me.

04:23:48.580 --> 04:23:51.580
But he's not well, he's got a fever.

04:24:17.580 --> 04:24:19.580
Are you sure this is the right way?

04:24:19.580 --> 04:24:22.580
Of course I'm sure. I live in this forest, don't I?

04:24:22.580 --> 04:24:24.580
Why don't we miss each other somewhere?

04:24:24.580 --> 04:24:27.580
Well, if you think you might, don't go there and it's up to you.

04:24:27.580 --> 04:24:31.580
But I've got to...

04:24:31.580 --> 04:24:33.580
Moomin!

04:24:33.580 --> 04:24:35.580
Oh, Snarkmaid.

04:24:35.580 --> 04:24:37.580
Huh?

04:24:37.580 --> 04:24:40.580
Where are you taking him, Stinky? You can see he's not well.

04:24:40.580 --> 04:24:43.580
I'm not taking him. He insisted on going. I came to look after him.

04:24:43.580 --> 04:24:45.580
Is that really right, Moomin?

04:24:45.580 --> 04:24:49.580
Yes, I wanted to find Snuffkin, so he'd come back.

04:24:49.580 --> 04:24:51.580
Well, I was going to find him for you.

04:24:51.580 --> 04:24:54.580
Little Mai and Sniff were coming too, but they chickened out so I came on my own.

04:24:54.580 --> 04:24:56.580
What did Snork say about that?

04:24:56.580 --> 04:24:57.580
That he wasn't happy.

04:24:57.580 --> 04:24:59.580
Oh, he made a big fuss and I just let him.

04:24:59.580 --> 04:25:01.580
So you just walked out and came on your own?

04:25:01.580 --> 04:25:03.580
Brothers, always think they can tell you what to do.

04:25:03.580 --> 04:25:06.580
I just ignore him. Did you tell your parents where you were?

04:25:06.580 --> 04:25:08.580
Ah, no.

04:25:08.580 --> 04:25:11.580
Did you put him up to this Stinky? It's just a sort of thing you do.

04:25:11.580 --> 04:25:12.580
No, I did not.

04:25:12.580 --> 04:25:14.580
That's true, Snork Maiden.

04:25:14.580 --> 04:25:19.580
Well, I don't know how you did it, Stinky, but I know you and I know you're to blame

04:25:19.580 --> 04:25:21.580
and I don't think I won't find out.

04:25:21.580 --> 04:25:24.580
That's not fair, Snork Maiden. It was nothing to do with me at all.

04:25:24.580 --> 04:25:26.580
Oh, he's right, Snork Maiden.

04:25:26.580 --> 04:25:28.580
He didn't want to show me the way, but I made him.

04:25:30.580 --> 04:25:32.580
I'm taking you home.

04:25:32.580 --> 04:25:34.580
Oh, but Snork Maiden.

04:25:34.580 --> 04:25:38.580
No, buts. You're sick and you should be in bed and your parents must be very worried.

04:25:38.580 --> 04:25:40.580
Look!

04:25:41.580 --> 04:25:42.580
Moomin!

04:25:42.580 --> 04:25:45.580
Oh, it's Papa. Isn't that Snork behind him?

04:25:45.580 --> 04:25:47.580
I guess it is.

04:25:47.580 --> 04:25:49.580
Uh-oh, it's time I wasn't here.

04:25:49.580 --> 04:25:53.580
I'm glad you hadn't gone too far, Moomin. I might never have found you.

04:25:53.580 --> 04:25:55.580
I'm very sorry, Papa.

04:25:57.580 --> 04:26:01.580
I have a feeling you're behind this, Stinky. Come on, quickly, out with it.

04:26:01.580 --> 04:26:05.580
Why doesn't anyone believe me? It was Moomin's idea. I swear it was.

04:26:05.580 --> 04:26:08.580
It was, Papa. I wanted to find Snorkkin.

04:26:09.580 --> 04:26:11.580
Are you all right, Moomin?

04:26:11.580 --> 04:26:13.580
Snork Maiden!

04:26:14.580 --> 04:26:17.580
Uh, here we go again.

04:26:17.580 --> 04:26:21.580
Snork Maiden, what are you doing here? I thought I told you not to go on this silly jump.

04:26:21.580 --> 04:26:23.580
Well, I didn't say I wouldn't. Did I?

04:26:23.580 --> 04:26:25.580
Listen to me, Snork.

04:26:25.580 --> 04:26:30.580
You're looking guilty, Stinky. How did you persuade her to disobey me?

04:26:30.580 --> 04:26:32.580
See, I told you.

04:26:33.580 --> 04:26:41.580
You stay nice and warm in bed and I'll mix some of grandma's potion with honey for you.

04:26:41.580 --> 04:26:46.580
You'll have to be better soon because I have a feeling Snuffkin's on his way.

04:26:52.580 --> 04:26:56.580
My wish Snuffkin would hurry up, then we could all get back to normal at last.

04:26:56.580 --> 04:26:59.580
My sentiment's exactly.

04:27:00.580 --> 04:27:02.580
So where is Snuffkin?

04:27:02.580 --> 04:27:05.580
Well, he's on his way back to Moomin Valley.

04:27:05.580 --> 04:27:10.580
But he's had a very long walk and is getting very tired now.

04:27:21.580 --> 04:27:25.580
Poor Snuffkin. He's had a terrible cold as well.

04:27:25.580 --> 04:27:28.580
Disfeeling rather weak.

04:27:30.580 --> 04:27:32.580
Snuffkin.

04:27:49.580 --> 04:27:52.580
Hello, I know you don't I?

04:27:52.580 --> 04:27:53.580
Oh?

04:27:53.580 --> 04:27:56.580
Yes, you're Snuffkin.

04:28:00.580 --> 04:28:01.580
Oh!

04:28:09.580 --> 04:28:12.580
Isn't that water still a little cold for that?

04:28:20.580 --> 04:28:24.580
You'd better come by the fire and keep warm or you'll catch cold.

04:28:30.580 --> 04:28:32.580
This is nice.

04:28:38.580 --> 04:28:41.580
Just think, I'll be the one that's set by Snuffkin's fire.

04:28:41.580 --> 04:28:44.580
And he told me to keep warm and not catch cold.

04:28:44.580 --> 04:28:48.580
Hmm, that's no big thing, little fella. It's a pretty chilly night out here.

04:28:48.580 --> 04:28:52.580
Oh, it is. I've heard so many stories about you from everybody.

04:28:52.580 --> 04:28:57.580
And each year I try to watch you should go past, but I've never been brave enough to talk to you before.

04:28:57.580 --> 04:29:00.580
Stories from everybody, I don't know if I like that.

04:29:00.580 --> 04:29:02.580
In fact, I'm sure I don't.

04:29:02.580 --> 04:29:04.580
What's your name, little fella?

04:29:05.580 --> 04:29:07.580
Oh, well, I haven't got one.

04:29:07.580 --> 04:29:09.580
I'm so small that nobody's ever asked me before.

04:29:09.580 --> 04:29:12.580
I've always wanted to have a name, you know?

04:29:12.580 --> 04:29:14.580
And it was you who asked me.

04:29:14.580 --> 04:29:17.580
And I've actually met you and sat next to you at your camp fire.

04:29:17.580 --> 04:29:21.580
Oh, it's so wonderful. You don't know how happy it makes me meeting you like this.

04:29:21.580 --> 04:29:25.580
Oh, come on. You do go on a bit, old fella. You just get warm now.

04:29:25.580 --> 04:29:29.580
Do you think, Snuffkin? Oh, I don't know whether I should ask you or I don't want to offend you.

04:29:29.580 --> 04:29:31.580
Oh, well, why not? Yes, I will.

04:29:33.580 --> 04:29:38.580
Perhaps you'd be kind enough to. I mean, would it be too much trouble for you to think of a name for me?

04:29:40.580 --> 04:29:42.580
There. I've said it now.

04:29:44.580 --> 04:29:48.580
Well, choosing a name is important. I'd have to think carefully about that.

04:29:48.580 --> 04:29:51.580
But it will be easy for you. You know everything.

04:29:51.580 --> 04:29:56.580
Now listen to me. You can't look up to people too much if you want to be yourself. It's not right.

04:29:56.580 --> 04:30:01.580
But Snuffkin, you're so clever. You can do anything, anything at all. I know you can.

04:30:01.580 --> 04:30:06.580
I've always wanted to be free like you to do whatever I feel.

04:30:06.580 --> 04:30:12.580
Oh, I'm sorry I'm talking too much. I want to listen to you too. All about your travels for a start.

04:30:12.580 --> 04:30:15.580
I know you're on your way to the Moon Valley to see all your friends.

04:30:16.580 --> 04:30:21.580
The hedgehog told me the Moon stayed out for most of the winter. Just waiting for you to come back.

04:30:21.580 --> 04:30:23.580
Now isn't that wonderful? What?

04:30:23.580 --> 04:30:27.580
I'd love to have someone that missed me so much they were miserable until I came back.

04:30:27.580 --> 04:30:30.580
You don't know how lucky you are that you're so special.

04:30:30.580 --> 04:30:35.580
Well, perhaps I'm not going there. I might have somewhere else to visit instead.

04:30:38.580 --> 04:30:42.580
Oh, Moon will be very sad if you don't go back.

04:30:42.580 --> 04:30:45.580
Yes, but you've got to have time to be on your own as well.

04:30:45.580 --> 04:30:49.580
Of course you have and I've taken up too much of yours now.

04:30:49.580 --> 04:30:51.580
Wait, I think I'll be off.

04:30:51.580 --> 04:30:53.580
Okay, thanks.

04:30:57.580 --> 04:30:59.580
Goodbye Snuffkin.

04:30:59.580 --> 04:31:01.580
Good night, little fella.

04:31:13.580 --> 04:31:16.580
Hey, wait a minute. What about your name?

04:31:16.580 --> 04:31:18.580
You remembered.

04:31:18.580 --> 04:31:22.580
Well, what do you think of TD Wu, my friend?

04:31:22.580 --> 04:31:24.580
Yes, TD Wu.

04:31:24.580 --> 04:31:28.580
It's nice and happy to start with and then a little sadness.

04:31:28.580 --> 04:31:30.580
TD Wu.

04:31:30.580 --> 04:31:33.580
That's right. TD Wu.

04:31:33.580 --> 04:31:36.580
TD Wu.

04:31:36.580 --> 04:31:39.580
TD Wu. TD Wu.

04:31:39.580 --> 04:31:41.580
TD Wu.

04:31:41.580 --> 04:31:43.580
TD Wu.

04:31:43.580 --> 04:31:45.580
TD Wu.

04:31:45.580 --> 04:31:49.580
That's right. It's a wonderful name.

04:31:49.580 --> 04:31:51.580
TD Wu.

04:31:51.580 --> 04:31:57.580
I'm glad you like it. It's the first time I've ever given anyone a name.

04:31:57.580 --> 04:32:03.580
I think I'll be able to house and then I can put up a real name plate that says TD Wu.

04:32:03.580 --> 04:32:07.580
Ah, good idea, TD Wu. About what I said before.

04:32:07.580 --> 04:32:08.580
Huh?

04:32:08.580 --> 04:32:14.580
You know, not going back to Moon Valley? Well, I am. I've missed Moon and all my friends.

04:32:14.580 --> 04:32:18.580
Oh, I didn't take that seriously. You just got upset at something I said.

04:32:18.580 --> 04:32:21.580
I'm afraid that happens a lot. I guess I talked too much.

04:32:21.580 --> 04:32:23.580
Maybe you do.

04:32:23.580 --> 04:32:28.580
I'll be going back to Moon Valley a bit behind schedule and this year Spring came along early too.

04:32:28.580 --> 04:32:32.580
But I suppose it's better late than never, as I say.

04:32:32.580 --> 04:32:37.580
Moment will be happy. Say hello to everyone from TD Wu.

04:32:37.580 --> 04:32:40.580
I will. And I'll tell them how it came about.

04:32:40.580 --> 04:32:45.580
That's where you keep your harmonica, isn't it, Snuffkin? It's really famous, you know?

04:32:45.580 --> 04:32:47.580
I didn't realize that.

04:32:47.580 --> 04:32:51.580
Do you know? I've never ever heard any music.

04:32:54.580 --> 04:32:56.580
Really? What would you like me to play?

04:32:56.580 --> 04:33:01.580
Anything. Oh, I know. What about Moon's favorite?

04:33:01.580 --> 04:33:03.580
I don't know.

04:33:32.580 --> 04:33:38.580
Hmm? That's Snuffkin!

04:33:53.580 --> 04:33:55.580
Don't know.

04:34:01.580 --> 04:34:03.580
Snuffkin!

04:34:31.580 --> 04:34:38.580
Now at last Spring really has come to Moon Valley.

04:35:02.580 --> 04:35:08.580
The Moon is. The Moon is.

04:35:08.580 --> 04:35:15.580
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moon is.

04:35:15.580 --> 04:35:22.580
Believing and sharing and caring and giving the Moon is.

04:35:22.580 --> 04:35:26.580
They're always happy and goes at play.

04:35:26.580 --> 04:35:33.580
The Moon's are having fun day after day. The Moon is.

04:35:33.580 --> 04:35:43.580
The Moon is. The Moon is.

04:35:57.580 --> 04:36:03.580
Here they are for one and all. The Moon's are about to call.

04:36:03.580 --> 04:36:17.580
Come on and sit down here with me. They're here for you on your TV. They are the Moon's.

04:36:17.580 --> 04:36:23.580
They are the Moon's. So come with me, give me your hand.

04:36:23.580 --> 04:36:29.580
I'll take you up to Moon and land. You can fly just like a bird.

04:36:29.580 --> 04:36:34.580
Sing that song ever. There were the Moon's.

04:36:34.580 --> 04:36:37.580
There were the Moon's.

04:36:37.580 --> 04:36:40.580
There were the Moon's.

04:36:40.580 --> 04:36:43.580
There were the Moon's.

04:36:43.580 --> 04:36:46.580
There were the Moon's.

04:36:46.580 --> 04:36:49.580
There were the Moon's.

04:36:53.580 --> 04:36:58.580
There were the Moon's.

04:36:58.580 --> 04:37:03.580
There were the Moon's.

04:37:03.580 --> 04:37:07.580
There were the Moon's.

04:37:07.580 --> 04:37:12.580
There were the Moon's.

04:37:12.580 --> 04:37:18.580
There were the Moon's.

04:37:18.580 --> 04:37:22.580
There were the Moon's.

04:37:23.580 --> 04:37:27.580
All is peaceful in Moon Valley.

04:37:27.580 --> 04:37:30.580
Mama waters the flowers.

04:37:30.580 --> 04:37:35.580
While Papa relaxes in the shade on the porch.

04:37:35.580 --> 04:37:39.580
Look, Mama, Moon Papa is sleeping again.

04:37:39.580 --> 04:37:41.580
He had a long nap yesterday.

04:37:41.580 --> 04:37:43.580
I think it must be the weather.

04:37:43.580 --> 04:37:45.580
Too hot and sunny for me.

04:37:45.580 --> 04:37:48.580
I wonder if he's worried about anything.

04:37:48.580 --> 04:37:51.580
You don't sleep if you're worried you do something about it.

04:37:52.580 --> 04:37:56.580
But Moon and Papa does have something on his mind.

04:37:56.580 --> 04:38:03.580
Although it doesn't keep him awake.

04:38:03.580 --> 04:38:08.580
He's having a nice dream as well.

04:38:22.580 --> 04:38:26.580
Oh, a lighthouse.

04:38:26.580 --> 04:38:29.580
That's it.

04:38:29.580 --> 04:38:31.580
That's it, a lighthouse.

04:38:31.580 --> 04:38:33.580
What about a lighthouse, Papa?

04:38:33.580 --> 04:38:35.580
We're going to visit one.

04:38:35.580 --> 04:38:36.580
When?

04:38:36.580 --> 04:38:37.580
Right now.

04:38:37.580 --> 04:38:40.580
Well, as soon as I find one, anyway.

04:38:40.580 --> 04:38:42.580
That should stop you being bored, Mama.

04:38:42.580 --> 04:38:44.580
Oh, I'm not really dear, but it would be nice.

04:38:44.580 --> 04:38:45.580
Yeah.

04:38:45.580 --> 04:38:48.580
Oh, I'm really excited.

04:38:49.580 --> 04:38:52.580
It turns into a lovely water.

04:38:52.580 --> 04:38:56.580
Yeah, I'll write an exciting, epic novel of the sea.

04:38:56.580 --> 04:38:58.580
I'm sure it will be a great success.

04:38:58.580 --> 04:39:02.580
If he puts some action in it, misses out the romantic stuff.

04:39:12.580 --> 04:39:15.580
Stop it!

04:39:19.580 --> 04:39:21.580
Tell me.

04:39:21.580 --> 04:39:24.580
Does Moonman Papa want all of you to go away to this lighthouse?

04:39:24.580 --> 04:39:25.580
Oh, yes.

04:39:25.580 --> 04:39:26.580
It'll be great fun.

04:39:26.580 --> 04:39:28.580
Just think of all the ships we'll be able to see.

04:39:28.580 --> 04:39:30.580
Yes, that will be good.

04:39:30.580 --> 04:39:33.580
Papa says he wants to write an exciting story about the sea.

04:39:33.580 --> 04:39:35.580
With ships and storms and stuff.

04:39:35.580 --> 04:39:37.580
Probably pirates, too.

04:39:37.580 --> 04:39:40.580
Oh, he's stuck writing his memoirs again, is he?

04:39:40.580 --> 04:39:43.580
Well, I guess that might have something to do with it.

04:39:43.580 --> 04:39:45.580
But I think he just wants another adventure.

04:39:45.580 --> 04:39:46.580
He's bored.

04:39:46.580 --> 04:39:48.580
Well, it sounds a bit odd to me, Moonman.

04:39:48.580 --> 04:39:49.580
No, it's not.

04:39:49.580 --> 04:39:55.580
We're going to live in a real lighthouse and save ships from the rocks and being wrecked terrible storms.

04:39:55.580 --> 04:39:56.580
Oh, I see.

04:39:56.580 --> 04:39:59.580
What do you think the lighthouse keeper might say about you moving in?

04:39:59.580 --> 04:40:01.580
Oh, he won't mind at all.

04:40:01.580 --> 04:40:04.580
It'll be company for it, and I'm sure he'd like someone to talk to.

04:40:04.580 --> 04:40:07.580
Looking after lighthouse is a very lonely job.

04:40:07.580 --> 04:40:12.580
Ah, but if you thought, Moonman, that might be exactly why he chooses to do it.

04:40:13.580 --> 04:40:17.580
You mean that he might want to be on his own all the time?

04:40:17.580 --> 04:40:19.580
Well, some people like it like that.

04:40:19.580 --> 04:40:22.580
Sometimes I like being on my own.

04:40:22.580 --> 04:40:24.580
Not for long, though.

04:40:24.580 --> 04:40:26.580
It'll be a lot of fun.

04:40:26.580 --> 04:40:29.580
Snuffkin, why don't you come with us?

04:40:29.580 --> 04:40:31.580
What, to a lonely lighthouse?

04:40:31.580 --> 04:40:33.580
Yes.

04:40:34.580 --> 04:40:38.580
Oh, no, which one is it?

04:40:38.580 --> 04:40:40.580
There, that's the one.

04:40:41.580 --> 04:40:43.580
So small, you can hardly see it.

04:40:43.580 --> 04:40:46.580
How long would it take us to get their Moonman, Papa?

04:40:46.580 --> 04:40:49.580
A day or two, I should say, depending on the wind.

04:40:49.580 --> 04:40:51.580
But it looks so tiny.

04:40:51.580 --> 04:40:52.580
Oh, I don't know.

04:40:52.580 --> 04:40:53.580
Well, I think so.

04:40:53.580 --> 04:40:55.580
How do we know which one is which?

04:40:55.580 --> 04:40:58.580
Oh, don't you worry about that.

04:40:58.580 --> 04:41:04.580
I've got an old compass somewhere, and we've got the map, then at night we'll be able to see the light itself.

04:41:04.580 --> 04:41:06.580
Anyway, an old sailor.

04:41:06.580 --> 04:41:07.580
An old sailor?

04:41:07.580 --> 04:41:09.580
Well, I'm not really that young.

04:41:09.580 --> 04:41:10.580
And you're no sailor.

04:41:10.580 --> 04:41:11.580
Is this mutiny?

04:41:11.580 --> 04:41:12.580
Don't be stupid.

04:41:15.580 --> 04:41:17.580
How long do you think you'll want to stay, Papa?

04:41:17.580 --> 04:41:18.580
About a month.

04:41:18.580 --> 04:41:21.580
Oh, we'll need to take lots and lots of food, then.

04:41:22.580 --> 04:41:23.580
Well, bless me.

04:41:23.580 --> 04:41:25.580
I think that'll be enough, Mama.

04:41:25.580 --> 04:41:27.580
Surely there'll be somebody living there already.

04:41:27.580 --> 04:41:28.580
Don't be stupid.

04:41:28.580 --> 04:41:29.580
Of course there is.

04:41:29.580 --> 04:41:31.580
A lighthouse must have a keeper.

04:41:32.580 --> 04:41:36.580
Yes, a man dedicated to the sea, suffering loneliness and hardship,

04:41:36.580 --> 04:41:39.580
saving countless lives with no regard for his own.

04:41:45.580 --> 04:41:46.580
Huh?

04:41:46.580 --> 04:41:47.580
Is that you, Sniff?

04:41:47.580 --> 04:41:49.580
Yes, hi, Mr. Hamilton.

04:41:49.580 --> 04:41:52.580
I thought you'd be busy packing for the trip to the lighthouse.

04:41:52.580 --> 04:41:55.580
No, well, I'm not going with them this time.

04:41:55.580 --> 04:41:57.580
I've decided to stay here.

04:41:57.580 --> 04:42:00.580
Oh, dear me, really? Sniffkin said he was going.

04:42:00.580 --> 04:42:02.580
Well, I have something very important to do.

04:42:02.580 --> 04:42:03.580
Important?

04:42:03.580 --> 04:42:05.580
Sniff is just a big whip, that's all.

04:42:05.580 --> 04:42:07.580
Oh, shut up, little mind.

04:42:07.580 --> 04:42:08.580
Ah, don't tell me to shut up.

04:42:08.580 --> 04:42:10.580
I don't listen to whims.

04:42:10.580 --> 04:42:13.580
Hmm, now, now children, no squabbling.

04:42:13.580 --> 04:42:15.580
It wouldn't be fair to the others.

04:42:15.580 --> 04:42:17.580
I'm not a very good swimmer.

04:42:17.580 --> 04:42:19.580
You mean if you fell and then we're drowning,

04:42:19.580 --> 04:42:20.580
we'd have to jump in and save you.

04:42:20.580 --> 04:42:21.580
Don't fall in, then.

04:42:21.580 --> 04:42:23.580
Anyway, you could hang on to an or something.

04:42:23.580 --> 04:42:25.580
What if it got swept away?

04:42:25.580 --> 04:42:28.580
We'll put a life jacket on you stupid, don't worry.

04:42:28.580 --> 04:42:29.580
What about the sharks?

04:42:29.580 --> 04:42:31.580
They might take a fancy to me.

04:42:31.580 --> 04:42:32.580
Wait a minute.

04:42:32.580 --> 04:42:34.580
I know I'm not as�ologist,

04:42:34.580 --> 04:42:36.580
but I don't think there are any sharks around here.

04:42:36.580 --> 04:42:38.580
I'm sure I would have heard if there were.

04:42:44.580 --> 04:42:46.580
Well, it's a real fine day for sailing.

04:42:46.580 --> 04:42:49.580
Where are mama and the others?

04:42:49.580 --> 04:42:52.580
Don't worry, Mumma, there's no hurry.

04:42:52.580 --> 04:42:55.580
Are you sure that isn't too heavy for you, Sniff?

04:42:55.580 --> 04:42:57.580
No, not at all, mama.

04:42:57.580 --> 04:42:59.580
It's a shame that you're not coming with us,

04:42:59.580 --> 04:43:01.580
but if you've got something important to do,

04:43:01.580 --> 04:43:03.580
it won't be the same without you, though.

04:43:03.580 --> 04:43:05.580
We'll miss you, Sniff.

04:43:05.580 --> 04:43:06.580
Thank you.

04:43:06.580 --> 04:43:08.580
Oh, dear, I left a jar of strawberry jam

04:43:08.580 --> 04:43:11.580
and a whole batch of pancakes on the kitchen table.

04:43:11.580 --> 04:43:13.580
Do you think you could manage to eat them?

04:43:13.580 --> 04:43:14.580
Leave it to me.

04:43:14.580 --> 04:43:17.580
Hi, y'all be lucky if there's any food left in the lard or mama.

04:43:17.580 --> 04:43:19.580
He's a my.
