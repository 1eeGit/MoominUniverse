1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're here for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:30,239
They are the movements, they are the movements,

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:37,159
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land, you can fly

8
00:00:37,159 --> 00:01:47,000
just like a bird, sing that song ever, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la The rain was falling on Mumen Valley as though the heavens had decided to empty themselves.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It was the wettest weather that anyone could remember. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going this? Of course, dear. And this one too?

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, dear, but what do you need them for?

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll give you some.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll give you some.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll give you some.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll give you some.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll give you some.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll give you some.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll give you some.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll give you some.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll give you some. I'll give you some. You'll miss one too? Yes, dear, but what do you need them for? It's a secret.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
A secret?

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah, sure.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll want to see a back moment, but you can keep the jar, if you like.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Thanks. Oh, dear me. Oh, there are puddles everywhere. Oh, dear me, Mr. Hemmielen.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What a mess.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hello, Mr. Hemmielen.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, dear me.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, dear me.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, dear me.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, dear me.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh, dear me.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, dear me.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, dear me.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, dear me.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, dear me.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Mr. Hemmielen. What a mess dear me, Mr. Hemmielin, what a mess!

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hello, Mr. Hemmielin!

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, good morning, Momen!

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, it's all misty now.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What are you doing, Momen?

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Observing very closely.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, splendid, my boy. I'm glad you find botany so exciting.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, what exactly is boy. I'm glad you find botany so exciting.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,599
Oh, what exactly is it you're observing?

54
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sure I saw a beautiful crayfish in there.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Crayfish?

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,039
Excuse me, young man, but that is the wall

57
00:03:54,039 --> 00:05:01,000
of Zeequette, the most uninteresting field. There it is. Oh Oh! Hey! Hey! Hey!

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! I got him! I got him! I got him!

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I got him!

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Huh?

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, dragon!

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh, dragon.

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Papa!

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh, what have you got there?

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, oh, nothing, Papa.

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Everything's so fresh after the rain.

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh, woman.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes, it is.

70
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,500
I got to show this to Snuffkin before anybody else sees it.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh. Oh Boom moment! What do you got there, Moonman?

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, nothing! Nothing at all, little lion.

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh yes, you have, I saw it! Don't lie to me!

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's just one of Mama's old jars!

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Liar! Liar! I know there'sar, liar, I know there's nothing.

76
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't think there's nothing.

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Then why are you hiding it?

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, right, you little mice. See me, it's not fair.

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Dragon. Ah, yeah, I was right.

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It must be a baby dragon.

81
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Probably the very last one on Earth and washed up by the rain.

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
A dragon of my own.

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Well, that's wonderful.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, I hope I did it frighten you.

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I know what frighten you.

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I know what I'll do. I'll take the lid off the jar so you can get some fresh air and little dragon.

87
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
See? That's better, isn't it? Come on, little fella. We'll give you a cut so make you be starving. I'll get you something from my nighttime emergency food box. I've got lots of things in there. Bound to be something you like.

88
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Go on. Take anything you won. Ah! Oh!

89
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh!

90
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh!

91
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh!

92
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh!

93
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh!

94
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh!

95
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh!

96
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh!

97
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh!

98
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh! Oh! Oh!

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Gosh!

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's really clever, little dragon!

101
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Moving! Lunch is ready!

102
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Coming!

103
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Now you stay here.

104
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't worry, I'll be back in no time at all!

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Remember, you're my own little dragon!

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh! Remember, you're my own little dragon. Mm-hmm.

107
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Oh.

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh.

109
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Where's Sniff? I thought he was here as well.

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He's collecting worms for fishing.

111
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He'll be here soon.

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We'll start without him then.

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You know, Mama, certain people keep secrets and glass jars.

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,100
Secrets?

115
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,440
Oh, yes, a little secret that hisses.

116
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,360
Moment mama, I found this near the big puddle.

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,679
Thank you, sniff. Moment, I told you I wanted it back.

118
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,759
It's my very best one.

119
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,840
Sorry mama, I was so excited.

120
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:29,120
I must have left it when I found, I mean when I was was and I'm sure you know who I mean by certain people.

121
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,519
Did you catch anything with the sieve moment?

122
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,440
Yes he did something that's now hidden in his room.

123
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,840
Big mouth.

124
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,600
If it's a secret little my perhaps he doesn't want to tell anyone.

125
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,159
Yeah probably because his new pet bites.

126
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,899
Well it hasn't bitten you yet, hasn't it?

127
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:49,200
Huh, if it did, I'd bite it back.

128
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,039
Is it true?

129
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,600
Does your secret really bite people?

130
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,100
Well, it couldn't bite very hard

131
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,279
if it was small enough to go in a jar, good at papa?

132
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,080
I suppose certain people might keep

133
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,600
other small things in jars, beetles and spiders,

134
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,720
mosquitoes, scorpions, or poisonous centipedes, horrible things that multiply

135
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,519
and multiply every week and grow and grow until the jars

136
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,519
are too small.

137
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,600
See, like that.

138
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,919
And there'll be so many of them, thousands and thousands,

139
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,879
and they'll take over moving valley and eat us all.

140
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:22,840
Oh, well, I haven't got a centipede.

141
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,500
I wonder if centipedes come from out of space.

142
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,240
But this is the Earth's deer.

143
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,080
The rain could have brought them down from space, Mama, couldn't it?

144
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,320
Well, you could be right.

145
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,879
It was raining very hard yesterday.

146
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,679
And it wasn't like ordinary rain.

147
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,679
I saw a puddle as big as a lake.

148
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,919
What's the matter, Moomin?

149
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,000
It isn't a centipede.

150
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ha, we're on the right track, though. Well, I'm glad it's not a poisonous centipede.

151
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I shouldn't have liked that.

152
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, you're asleep.

153
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Moomin's little dragon.

154
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,480
Oh, you're asleep. Moments little dragon. Is it okay if I go see Snuffkin, mama?

155
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,080
Have you finished already?

156
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,919
Yes, I have.

157
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,919
Tell them they mustn't go into my room.

158
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,720
Or they'll have to take the consequence, sis.

159
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
All right, Momen.

160
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
I'll make sure no one goes in there.

161
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
I promise.

162
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh, but he's gonna tell Snuffkin. I have to take the consequence, sis. All right, movement. I'll make sure no one goes in there.

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I promise.

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,500
Oh, but he's gonna tell snuck in the secret.

165
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,000
I should think he is.

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Best friends always come first, little my. Hey, Snuffkin!

167
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Hi!

168
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Fishing again?

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yep.

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The cards told me that if I caught five minnows, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south.

171
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
South?

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You're joking!

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Not at all.

174
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I believe in the cards.

175
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm not joking.

176
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm not joking.

177
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm not joking. I'm not joking. I'm not joking. I'm not joking. The cards told me that if I caught five minnows, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south.

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,500
South?

179
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You're joking. Not at all. I believe in the cards.

180
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But snuffkin, winter's not here yet.

181
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,000
I know that, but the cards tell you things for a reason, movement.

182
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh, do they really?

183
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,000
But it would be awful if you and your way snuffkin, just awful. I mean, I'd be very lonely.

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And anyway, who would I talk to or tell my secrets to?

185
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, snuff can quickly.

186
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You must come up to the moment house.

187
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Now?

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

189
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Well, I suppose I could fish later.

190
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
No, no. There's no point.

191
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But I have to catch five minnows.

192
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh.

193
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The fish won't bite after all his rain.

194
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You'd catch nothing.

195
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It'll be better to wait until it's stopped flowing so fast.

196
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Well, perhaps you're right.

197
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So what's this big secret all about?

198
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Hey, Moonman.

199
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Have you ever seen a dragon snuffkin?

200
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
No, of course not.

201
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They all disappeared off the face of the earth many hundreds of years ago.

202
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:08,259
But perhaps they didn't all disappear.

203
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,860
What if there was one alive somewhere?

204
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,159
That's impossible.

205
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,299
It could be so small that it would go in a glass jar, though, again.

206
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:17,820
Are you sure you're not daydreaming, Moomin?

207
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,179
But still, anything is possible, I suppose.

208
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:21,500
But you know me.

209
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,000
I have to see it right in front of me before I believe it.

210
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh!

211
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh, where is it? Mama promised me that she wouldn't let anyone in.

212
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I's not here either.

213
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Well, you were right, Moomin.

214
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,960
Huh? here either. Well you were right movement. What?

215
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,759
Ah there he is. I think you found a real dragon. How do you get up there? He

216
00:13:54,759 --> 00:14:00,200
mustn't fall. He might lose his tail. Don't move little dragon and snuff can keep quiet.

217
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:07,399
He might get frightened and do something silly. Don't worry, I'll soon have you down. This will do a lead on the floor here.

218
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,759
Jump, little dragon.

219
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,279
Don't be afraid.

220
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,799
Come on, hold onto this.

221
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,480
It will bring you down slowly.

222
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,240
Don't panic.

223
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,879
I don't think it's a very good idea, Moomin.

224
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,240
You'll only scare him away.

225
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,879
Why don't you just leave him alone?

226
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:23,919
He'll come down when he's ready.

227
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,000
Dragons aren't helpless, you know, even little baby ones.

228
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But he's so small. Come to a moment.

229
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Come on. Don't you understand?

230
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Hold onto that and I'll listen to you.

231
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Oh!

232
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh!

233
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Oh!

234
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh!

235
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Look at him! My dragon can fly! He's flying!

236
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
He's flying!

237
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Come down, little dragon!

238
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You might crush into something!

239
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Come down!

240
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh!

241
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh!

242
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh!

243
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh!

244
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh!

245
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh!

246
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Oh!

247
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Be careful, Snuffkin. He might bite.

248
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,399
I don't think so. He's a very unusual pet.

249
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,000
I think he likes you more than me.

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Ah!

251
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What a charming little creature, Moon.

252
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He's lovely. What's his name? He's called Little Dragon.

253
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,519
Ha! I don't think he's lovely at all. Small but savage, if you ask my opinion.

254
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,759
That sounds just like you, little mime.

255
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,000
You think so?

256
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Ow!

257
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah!

258
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,679
No, oh, oh, oh.

259
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:57,679
Whoa!

260
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,679
Oh!

261
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,679
Ow!

262
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:00,679
Now look here.

263
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,679
Oh, wait.

264
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,679
Ah.

265
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He seems to have a thing about ears, doesn't he?

266
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Step Snuffkins, why doesn't he bite him?

267
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Go on, dragon.

268
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Go on, vitamin! He's really tasty! Go on!

269
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Good news, I think he's trying to heat up Snuffkins coffee.

270
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
He must really like him.

271
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Clevver little thing.

272
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Well, I hope he's careful with that hot breath.

273
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We don't want to start a fire.

274
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
All right, that's enough.

275
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
He might be useful.

276
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
When he's bigger, we can put him in the cellar

277
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and he'll be able to keep the whole house just like a furnace.

278
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
No, we will not.

279
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,759
Huh? Not Go away you pass

280
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,379
And you he only thought you were trying to get his fly I'll get him if he bites me again just you watch me doing

281
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,759
Come on little dragon.

282
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm sure that'll keep him quiet. That better go. Thanks for the coffee, Moomin' Mama.

283
00:17:37,000 --> 00:18:00,680
Oh no, it'll suffocate him! He only seems to like Snuffkin.

284
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,200
Well we all like Snuffkin.

285
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,599
Stupid old dragon. No, he isn't.

286
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,000
Moomin, dear. Why don't you take him to your room?

287
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
He'll be happier there.

288
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
This will be best for him.

289
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh, I wonder if he'll come back to visit us.

290
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,400
Why did you do that?

291
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,200
He was cute and weak and aball is more an ear muff.

292
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,400
You can visit him in Snuffkin's tent.

293
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,599
I expect little dragons already sitting on his shoulder.

294
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:36,000
It doesn't matter anyway. Snuffkin's going south soon.

295
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We'll be able to go together.

296
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh, my dear, Moomin. Never mind.

297
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Well, you're a bit of a problem.

298
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't want you here, little dragon.

299
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Go on, go away. Go to movement.

300
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Don't do that.

301
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Oh, come on, please go to movement.

302
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Look, you're very nice and it'd be fun to have you along.

303
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But there's movement, and he'd know you were here and you'd be upset.

304
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh, there's another one.

305
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's the fifth? Oh, dear.

306
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Hm? I'm sure you'll get hungry. Yeah, what do you want in return? A small favor.

307
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm sure you'll get hungry. I'm sure you'll get hungry.

308
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah, what do you want in return?

309
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
A small favor.

310
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm sure you'll get hungry.

311
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Yeah, what do you want in return?

312
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:53,039
A small favor.

313
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,079
Take this as far as you can, open the lid and just leave it. What? Just leave it?

314
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,519
Yes, in a nice quiet place, with lots and lots of flies.

315
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:04,359
Flies? What's in there?

316
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,400
A dragon. A dragon? Does's in there? A dragon.

317
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
A dragon? Does it bite?

318
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,799
Well, it might.

319
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,000
This is a big favor. I don't even like minors.

320
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh, they're not too bad if you rose them.

321
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,500
Keep the lid on, but make sure you open it up later.

322
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,000
So it can catch the flies.

323
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,400
All right, as long as it doesn't try to bite me.

324
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:36,000
Don't worry. It won't.

325
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Hello. Hi.

326
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Oh, oh, oh.

327
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Where is he?

328
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Who is that?

329
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,299
My dragon. He must have come here snuffkin. Oh

330
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,539
Really I thought he was home with you sleeping in your room

331
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
No, I let him out

332
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:58,599
Well dragons are very fickle all they really care about is big fat flies. It's best to forget about a moment

333
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,000
Did you catch your five minnows?, you were right. The water is too fast.

334
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Oh, really?

335
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So I won't go soft until winter comes.

336
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You'll stay here then?

337
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, I'm sure it wouldn't do to go against the cards.

338
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Now what did Moomin' my friend?

339
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, that's great!

340
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You're staying stuff, kid.

341
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Fantastic! That's really, really good!

342
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Ah, perhaps I shouldn't have painted the float bright red.

343
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It might have scared those little minors right away.

344
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Okay, let's go.

345
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah.

346
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That dragon was sort of stupid.

347
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Baby dragons are.

348
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
They make the world's worst pets.

349
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
They never want to settle in one place.

350
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah, you're right.

351
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,160
It was very funny though when it bit little mice here. I think it could be a little bit more fun. They make the world's worst pets. They never want to settle in one place. Yeah, you're right.

352
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,160
It was very funny though when it bit little mice here.

353
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,559
I think it gave her a taste of her own medicine.

354
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,839
LAUGHTER

355
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,559
The woman was very happy that Snuffkin was staying in Mumen Valley

356
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,799
and not going south until winter.

357
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:06,000
And as for the dragon, well, who wants to be loved by a silly old dragon?

358
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements

359
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements

360
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,000
They're always happy and always at play. The movements are having fun day after day.

361
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The movements.

362
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The movements.

363
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
They love the laughter and they love the living.

364
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The movements.

365
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

366
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
They're always happy and goes at play.

367
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

368
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The movements, the moment
