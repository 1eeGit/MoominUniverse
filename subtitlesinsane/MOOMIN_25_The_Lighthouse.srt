1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're here for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I think it's a good idea.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. There with me, there for you on your TV, there are the moments,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There are the moments, so come with me, give me your hand

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird

00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,319
Mama waters the flowers.

14
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,379
While Papa relaxes in the shade on the porch.

15
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:46,799
Look, Mama, aomin Papa is sleeping again.

16
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,799
Hmm.

17
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,599
You had a long nap yesterday.

18
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,000
I think it must be the weather.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,599
It's too hot and sunny for me.

20
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,599
I wonder if he's worried about anything.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,799
You don't sleep if you're worried you do something about it.

22
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:13,400
But Moomin Papa does have something on his mind, although it doesn't keep him awake.

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:27,000
He's having a nice dream as well. Oh, a lighthouse.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's it.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, that's it. A lighthouse.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What about a lighthouse, Papa?

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We're going to visit one.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
When?

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Right now. Well, as soon as I find one anyway. Lighthouse. What about a lighthouse, Papa? We're going to visit one.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
When?

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Right now.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, as soon as I find one anyway.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That should stop you being bored, Mama.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, I'm not really dear, but it would be nice.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, I'm really excited.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Just the time's letting lovely water.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll write an exciting, epic novel of the sea.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sure it will be a great success.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If he puts some action in it, misses out the romantic stuff.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Stop it!

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Tell me, does Moomin Papa want all of you to go away to this lighthouse?

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh yes, it'll be great fun. Just think of all the ships we'll be able to see.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes, that will be good.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,460
Papa says he wants to write an exciting story about the sea, with ships and storms and stuff. Probably pirates too.

47
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,939
Oh, he's stuck writing his memoirs again, is he?

48
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:55,060
Well, I guess that might have something to do with it, but I think he just wants another adventure.

49
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,840
He's bored.

50
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,080
Well, it sounds a bit odd to me, Moomin.

51
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,240
No, it's not.

52
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,560
We're going to live in a real lighthouse and save ships from the rocks and being wrecked terrible storms.

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,719
Oh, I see. What do you think the lighthouse keeper might say about you moving in?

54
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,840
Oh he won't mind at all. It'll be company for it and I'm sure he'd like someone to talk to.

55
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,399
Looking after lighthouses a very lonely job.

56
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,600
Ah but if you thought Moomin that might be exactly why he chooses to do it.

57
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,800
You mean that he might want to be on his own all the time?

58
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,360
Well, some people like it like that.

59
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,120
Sometimes I like being on my own.

60
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,360
Not for long though.

61
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,720
It'll be a lot of fun.

62
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,160
Snuffkin, why don't you come with us?

63
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,399
What to a lonely lighthouse?

64
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,399
Yes.

65
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:52,720
Oh no, which one is it is it there that's the one. Where? So small you can hardly see it.

66
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,240
How long would it take us to get their movement Papa? A day or two I should say

67
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,000
depending on the wind. But it looks so tiny. Oh I don't know. Well I think think so. How do we know which one is which?

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, don't you worry about that.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I've got an old compass somewhere,

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and we've got the map, then at night,

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
we'll be able to see the light itself.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Anyway, an old sailor.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
An old sailor?

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, I'm not really that young.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And an old sailor.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Is this mutiny?

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't be stupid.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
How long do you think you'll want to stay, Papa?

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
About a month.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, we'll need to take lots and lots of food then.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, bless me.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I think that'll be enough, Mama.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Surely there'll be somebody living there already.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't be stupid.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Of course there is.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A lighthouse must have a keeper.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes, a man dedicated to the sea,

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,040
suffering loneliness and hardship,

89
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,879
saving countless lives with no regard for his own.

90
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,040
Is that you, Sniff?

91
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,800
Yes, hi, Mr. Hemmillon.

92
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,439
I thought you'd be busy packing for the trip to the lighthouse.

93
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:05,000
No, well, I'm not going with them this time.

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I decided to stay here.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Oh dear me really, Snuffkin said he was going.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Well I have something very important to do.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Important?

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Sniff is just a big whip that's all.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh shut up little mind.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't tell me to shut up.

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't listen to whims.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Now now children, no squabbling.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,699
It wouldn't be fair to the others. I'm not a very good swimmer.

104
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,000
You mean if you fell and then we're drowning, we'd have to jump in and save you.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't fall in then. Anyway, you can hang on to an or something.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What if it got swept away?

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We'll put a life jacket on you stupid, don't worry.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What about the sharks? They might take a fancy to me.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,399
Wait a minute. I know I'm not as aologist, but I don't think there are any sharks around

110
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,399
here.

111
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,399
I'm sure I would have heard if there were.

112
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,399
Ugh.

113
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:56,800
Well, it's a real fine day for sailing.

114
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,199
Where are Mama and the others?

115
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't worry, Moments.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,399
There's no hurry.

117
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,800
Are you sure that isn't too heavy for you, Sniff?

118
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,639
No, not at all, Mama.

119
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,360
It's a shame that you're not coming with us,

120
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,040
but if you've got something important to do, you must do it.

121
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,680
It won't be the same without you, though.

122
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,839
We'll miss you, Sniff.

123
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,720
Thank you.

124
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,079
Oh, dear, I left a jar of strawberry jam

125
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,079
in a whole batch of pancakes on the kitchen table.

126
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,879
Do you think you could manage to eat them?

127
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,319
Leave it to me.

128
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,319
Hi, you'll be lucky if there's any food left in the

129
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,040
lard or mama.

130
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,639
He's a my.

131
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,879
Off we go then.

132
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,720
Ike is away.

133
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,480
He won't have to road too hard.

134
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,720
The wind will pick us up soon.

135
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,480
Goodbye.

136
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,519
Have a good time, everyone.

137
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,920
Goodbye, Snuffkin.

138
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,000
Now, don't forget to shut all the windows

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,240
if it rains, will you?

140
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
No.

141
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
No.

142
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
No.

143
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,240
No.

144
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
No.

145
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
No.

146
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
No.

147
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
No.

148
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
No.

149
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
No.

150
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
No.

151
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
No.

152
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
No.

153
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Hey!

154
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,240
Wake for me.

155
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
I want to have a good time.

156
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,000
Cool. Hey, wake. Huh? I want to have a good time too!

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Hey, stay away!

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Huh?

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm here!

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Look, Sniff is still waving.

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He's a sweet boy.

162
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Let's keep waving, Moonman, till we're out of sight.

163
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Bye, Sniff! Bye, bye!

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Bye, bye!

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Bye! No, not waving! Bye, bye! Bye! Bye!

166
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No, I'm not waving goodbye over the cutscene!

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't eat other old Mary Tam, I've got...

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's no good shouting, little Mai. He can't hear you.

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He's giving us a great send-off though,

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
for Snape should have come with us.

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Nancy, I'm going off and leaving me here on my own.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Snuffkin, if you wouldn't mind, I think we need some music to send us on our way.

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What do you say? Are you sure we're on the right course with the island, Papa?

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes, the winds with us and the sails are fine.

175
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I bet if we keep this speed up, we'll be there by tomorrow.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Well, if the wind stays like this, you could be right.

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The wind's not dying down at all.

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm surprised. I never thought we'd keep up this speed.

179
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Now make sure you're allergic to them.

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Of course we will be, Papa. If we carry on like this,

181
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
perhaps we'll see the light from the lighthouse while it's still dark.

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Well, we don't want to hit anything at this speed.

183
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't worry. We're watching.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Ah, this is the life.

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Papa, the wind's dropped. I'm going to have to go to the house. I'm going to have to go to the house. I'm going to have to go to the house. I'm going to have to go to the house.

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

187
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

190
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

193
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm going to have to go to the house. I'm going to see the lighthouse at night.

195
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's getting foggy too.

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I can't even see the stars anymore.

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Right, snuffkin. Wake me in two hours and I'll take over.

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay, Moomin, Papa. What's the matter, little my?

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I thought I heard something.

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh.

201
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's coming from over there somewhere.

202
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Can you see anything?

203
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
No, but I can hear it.

204
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So can I. Can you see anything? No. But I can hear it.

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So good I, and it's getting closer.

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Little.

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
MUMMUM POP!

208
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Get up, MUMMUM!

209
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Stop it, little my!

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What's the matter with you?

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You two, move in quickly before it's too late!

212
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What's the matter, little my?

213
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I can hear a ship. Stop it, little Mai! What's the matter with you? You too, move in quickly, before it's too late!

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What's the matter, little Mai?

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I can hear her ship! I can't see it, but it's very close and getting closer.

216
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
A ship? Where?

217
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Over there, and she's bearing down on us.

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Quickly, we don't have much time.

219
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes, by the boobalier right.

220
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We must let them know we're here, a signal. Right? All hands on deck.

221
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Maybe if we all shout as loud as we can.

222
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Look!

223
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Oh!

224
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Too late for shouting.

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's huge!

226
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Look out! It's gonna hit us!

227
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I think movement's right. What can we do?

228
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's too late for anything. Just brace ourselves and be ready to swim for it.

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Quick! Get down from the line!

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't believe it! I will buy!

231
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Huh?

232
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's hard! The ship didn't hit us!

233
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh yes, she did.

234
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What?

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It went straight into our rudder when nothing happened.

236
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It went right through us.

237
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Right through us, that's impossible she couldn't have.

238
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I wonder if there was anyone on board that ship.

239
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I can't see any lights.

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I know, Snuffkin, I think it's a ghost ship.

241
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
A ghost ship?

242
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,799
Well, there's no wash and no damage to us.

243
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,100
It's the only explanation. I think she's right.

244
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,799
A ghost ship. We've actually seen one.

245
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh dear, oh dear. I need to sit down. All this excitement's too much.

246
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Papa, don't they say that if you see a ghost ship something terrible is going to happen to you?

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,500
What happened in the first place to make it become a ghost ship? That's what I want to know.

248
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:59,000
Well that's just some old sailor's tale moment. If it had been a real ship we'd probably be sinking now.

249
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Don't you think so, it's enough kid.

250
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,500
Yeah, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.

251
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,200
Come on, cheer up you guys!

252
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,000
At least it was fun!

253
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah!

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What's the matter?

255
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
There's something happening.

256
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What are you laughing at?

257
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's so funny!

258
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Are you going to tell us?

259
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Why didn't you wake me up, you little?

260
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Well, I think you would be very rude.

261
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh, what a beautiful sky.

262
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Just look at it.

263
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, the's it dozed off? Oh, another beautiful day, not a ghost ship in sight.

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh!

265
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The lighthouse!

266
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, what a beautiful day!

267
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh, what a beautiful day!

268
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh, what a beautiful day!

269
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh, what a beautiful day!

270
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh, what a beautiful day!

271
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh, what a beautiful day!

272
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:26,179
Oh, what a beautiful day! Oh, what a beautiful day, not a ghost ship for hours. Oh, there it is. This is ridiculous.

273
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:27,820
We've been next to it all night.

274
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,620
We could have gone and slept there.

275
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,899
I can't wait to go ashore.

276
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,519
All right, everyone.

277
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,720
Jump to it.

278
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,620
Man the old.

279
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,460
Great.

280
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,460
Let's go.

281
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,259
There's something strange going on here.

282
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:44,059
What is it, Snowfgan?

283
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm not sure.

284
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Woman Papa.

285
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Our boat didn't move at all last night, did it?

286
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
No, it doesn't seem to have moved at all.

287
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So why couldn't we see the light from the lighthouse, even when the fog cleared?

288
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I can't work it out.

289
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes, you're right, Snuffkin. It seems very odd.

290
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
We should have seen it.

291
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,879
Well, perhaps the lighthouse keeper forgot to put it on, Moomin Papa.

292
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,440
I don't think so, little Mai.

293
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,000
You can't forget a thing like that.

294
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,399
I suppose it could be broken.

295
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,519
There could be lots of reasons for it.

296
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,759
Why don't we hurry up and get a shore,

297
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,960
and then we can ask the keeper.

298
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,000
Look, there's someone in a boat!

299
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Hmm.

300
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It looks like he's fishing.

301
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He know about the lighthouse.

302
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
He probably lives on the island.

303
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Let's get closer. Easy now.

304
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Ahoi there, good morning.

305
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Any luck?

306
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Not yet, but it's still early.

307
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hmm, yes, quite a... I'll ask him straight out.

308
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Do you know if the lighthouse was working last night?

309
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't know.

310
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

311
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
He said, no, it wasn't.

312
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What did I tell you? He forgot to light it.

313
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Oh, it wasn't only last night. You'll never see a light in that lighthouse.

314
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Not even on stormy nights.

315
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Never. So what does the keeper do then?

316
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,480
Nothing. There is does the keeper do then? Nothing.

317
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
There is an lighthouse keeper.

318
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
Why?

319
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
I'm sorry.

320
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,759
I'm afraid I don't know.

321
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,680
All I can say is I haven't seen one.

322
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,039
Do you live on the island?

323
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,039
Hey, mister.

324
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,960
You're asking too many questions.

325
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,200
Who are you?

326
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Huh?

327
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,740
I'm Moment Papa from from Moment Valley and this is my

328
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,079
family. We've come a long way in order to do some important work. You know work on

329
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:56,180
this island. No, you better go back home. You see I've come here to research an

330
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:02,140
epic novel about the sea. Just turn around and go back. You're too far from home.

331
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh please wait!

332
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Shh, dear, don't shout. We mustn't scare the fish away.

333
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Let's go a show and have some breakfast. I expect we're all hungry.

334
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Bunny, Pear. The old ones lost his marbles.

335
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,500
Look, Moomin Papa, there's a path here leading to the lighthouse.

336
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We'll leave this stuff here and we'll go and explore it first. Right, to the lighthouse everyone!

337
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Up!

338
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh!

339
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Come on!

340
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Oh!

341
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What's wrong?

342
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Why do you always get so upset when somebody mentions the lighthouse?

343
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's not your call, sir, and business. Business boy doesn't concern you at all.

344
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You were like that when I asked you about it before. Maybe if you were to tell me, I might be able to understand. I could try anyway.

345
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Either talk about something else or keep quiet. Do you understand that? It's so very rocky I don't think it would work what a garden Hello there! Is there anybody at home?

346
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
There's nobody here! That boy was right! It's been empty for ages I think!

347
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh the door was left unlocked! I know we do it but most people don't!

348
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Something terrible's happened! Something terrible! Please little my you know! Oh, the door was left unlocked. I know we do it, but most people don't.

349
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Something terrible's happened. Something terrible. Please, little my. You know I hate things like that.

350
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Don't worry, snort maidun. Little my is just trying to scare you.

351
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't like hearing about anything horrible.

352
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Flag your ears, then snort maidun, because I haven't finished yet, and the next bit's really horrible.

353
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh, well, where have you been finished there?

354
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

355
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Well, the lighthouse keeper is still up there.

356
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He got scurvy and had to be able to move for months.

357
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And nobody's heard his cries for help,

358
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and with no food he's almost to skeleton.

359
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
If he isn't dead already, he'll be at the top of the stairs

360
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
crawling towards his his fingers,

361
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
lading and ripped up ribbons of flow of smoke!

362
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
God, my death was terrible as ribbons and flowers, mouth, garbage, that was tiseless mouth!

363
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,119
Shut up, little mime!

364
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,000
Reminds right, that's enough.

365
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,680
Hmm, it was a good imagination though.

366
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,000
I'll let you use it in your book if you like.

367
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,960
Oh, come on.

368
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,839
Tell me what did she say, Moonman?

369
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,039
Oh, nothing, really.

370
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,200
Nothing at all.

371
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,559
Tell me, Moonman, but leave out the bits I wouldn't like.

372
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,200
Where are you going, Papa?

373
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,759
Well, listen, everyone.

374
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,400
First, I'm going to get the lamp working.

375
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Then we'll give the place a good clean and then we'll move in.

376
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:21,400
We'll be the new lighthouse keepers, and once again the seas around this island will be safe for ships to navigate in troubled water.

377
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Good old Papa!

378
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Great!

379
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,319
Care for everyone to take anything from water. Good old papa! Crap! Care for him, my dear.

380
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,480
I can't wait to see those dangerous.

381
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,480
Oh!

382
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,000
Will Mumen Papa be able to get the light working again?

383
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Where is the lighthouse keeper?

384
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And what could have made him go without locking the door,

385
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
leaving the ships in peril and the seas with no one to guide them away from the rocks?

386
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And who is the mysterious fisherman?

387
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:26,480
They love the laughter and they love the living, the women. the mysterious fishermen. Happy and always a play the movements are having fun day after day the

388
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,000

The Moves

390
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements

391
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Believing and sharing and caring and giving the movements

The movements, the Moon, the Moon
