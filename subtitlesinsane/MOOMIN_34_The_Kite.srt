1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They're for you on your TV.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, what do you think?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements, so come with me give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there was the time of year for movement to get restless.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,439
Snuff can to leave Mogen Valley on his yearly trek south.

11
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,280
Good morning, Papa. That bonfire looks inviting.

12
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,000
I hear up already.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mm-hmm.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We're buried in leaves this morning after that wind last night.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes, winders on the way.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, this is a lovely bonfire.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes, isn't it?

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I guess we're hibernating again this winter. Are we moving, Papa?

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hmm, well, of course. We always hibernate in the winter.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,800
If Snuffkin says I could go with him,

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,479
couldn't I give this winter a miss

22
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,639
and hibernate longer next year?

23
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,639
Mawd.

24
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,719
Oh, please, moving, Papa.

25
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:39,080
Snuffkin will rather go alone, I think, moving.

26
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,120
But I might get him to change his mind.

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,960
But Snuffkin's not really a person

28
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,520
who likes to be pressed.

29
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,360
Why not?

30
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,319
Well, he's a very solitary person.

31
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,039
His winter trip is the only time he can really be alone for a while.

32
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,759
I know, but I was just hoping.

33
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,840
Snoughkin likes you very much.

34
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,120
I know that.

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,080
And I think that's why he stays in Momen Valley

36
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,120
for the rest of the year.

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,000
But at heart, he's a vagabond and he needs time away from us.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He's not a family man, so he's free to do as he wants.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And as his friend, you should try to understand.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I know you'd like to go with him, but I don't think it is such a good idea.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He'd really hate to turn you down, I know.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I guess.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But he'd have to.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why aren't they biting?

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I haven't had a proper catch for days.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Getting too cold is it?

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
When are you leaving?

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Huh?

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're about to leave, aren't you?

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Could I ask you something? What? Don't go without telling me.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But why?

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm always sad when you leave, even though I know you'll return in the spring.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah. Me too, sort of.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's why this year I'd plan to leave without saying anything.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'd like to wish you good luck and all that.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I miss you so much when you're away. Please, Nuffkin. But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly. I'd like to wish you good luck and all that.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I miss you so much when you're away.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Please, Snuffkin.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Mumin, I have a better idea.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I won't leave until after you've started hibernating.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Then you won't miss me, will you?

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're right.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll take my great idea, Snuffkin.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Then we won't really part at all, won't we?

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Nope.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,680
Because I promised to be back here in Movement Valley before you even woken up.

72
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,519
Wonderful! What a super idea!

73
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:55,759
Hey, moment!

74
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,279
Oh, sniff!

75
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,000
Moment, come here a minute! There's something funny caught up in a tree!

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
What do you mean, funny?

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
I don't know exactly never saw anything like it before.

78
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,800
Snortman and little My found it first, but it's too high to get it down.

79
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Okay, I'll come have a look.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Be careful!

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Careful! What is it, moving?

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I know what it is, it's a kite.

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh what? A kite is something you fly in the sky.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There's no wings.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, you send it up against the wind on a string. Oh, oh a sec!

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh, throw it down!

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes, all right!

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, song!

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is what a kite looks like.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Looks broken to me.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sure we can fix it and make it fly.

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Let's see.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh no, the string must have broken when someone was flying it

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and the wind blew it down into the tree.

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, why don't we repair it?

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes, let's.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,600
Looks pretty badly broken to me.

98
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,240
Well I don't know, we'll have to see.

99
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,160
It is a kite isn't it? Hmm. Can we mend it? Maybe.

100
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,000
A very odd kite? It must have come from far away.

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You think it can be repaired?

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Of course.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Well, come on, then snork will help you repair it.

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I can repair it without your help,

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
as long as you can find us some really long string,

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
strong but not too thick of possible.

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I think I have what you need, some string.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Good, excellent. I'll start immediately. I'm so excited.

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh, I'm so excited.

110
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, I'm so excited.

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh, I'm so excited.

112
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Oh, I'm so excited.

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh, I'm so excited.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, I'm so excited.

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Oh, I'm so excited.

116
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,559
Oh, I'm so excited. Oh, I'm so excited. Oh, I'm so excited. This is a really exciting project I haven't flown a kite for years.

117
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,840
I do hope that string is long enough.

118
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,759
Snowark is this okay?

119
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,759
Fine, who's gonna fly it?

120
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,759
I'll do it.

121
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,240
Who cares, sniff?

122
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
Moving?

123
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,639
Hold the kite up high.

124
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,220
Like this? Hmm. All right, sniff, are you ready? I'll do it! Who cares, Sniff? Moomin, hold the kite up high!

125
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:46,779
Like this? Hmm.

126
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:48,720
Alright, Sniff, are you ready?

127
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:50,740
Yeah, I'm ready.

128
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,500
Don't let go, do I say win?

129
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Win, moment!

130
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,500
Ho!

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Uh-oh, it's fallen. Try again and this time start running and when the wind catches the kite you start paying out the light.

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Alright fine. Hold it up again, moment.

133
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Right. Ready?

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, I'm ready. Let go of it!

135
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Easy going up yet!

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No, it isn't. Stop! Let go of it! Yeezy going up again!

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No it isn't! Stop, Snap! You're breaking a kite!

138
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't think this kite's any good for anybody!

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The kite's fine! It's just that the wind is too weak!

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You're right. We'll have to wait for it to get stronger.

141
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Titty though, we certainly had a good strong wind yesterday.

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Is it okay?

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I think the wind is getting stronger, Moomin. Oh, my God! There it goes!

144
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
With me, all the strength, little man.

145
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Boy, this wind is really strong! Can I let out the strength now?

146
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Do it slowly, my...

147
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,200
All right. Boy, this wind is really strong! Can I let out the string now?

148
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
Do it slowly, Mike!

149
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Alright!

150
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Let me do it!

151
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Snip them on!

152
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
It's my turn!

153
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,600
Let me break your kiln, little boy!

154
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Why not?

155
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Because you don't win, I'm taller!

156
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
I'm very strong!

157
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
My gun's quite dry!

158
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:52,799
You come up with it!

159
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
You're still... Yes, Papa?

160
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,600
The difficulty could hold it for a while.

161
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,000
Well, yes, you'd like it.

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
Hold it really tight, then.

163
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
All right, I could do this long before he was born!

164
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Oops!

165
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Watch the rain!

166
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Papa, why did you drop quickly?

167
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And I'm winding, I'm winding!

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:45,279
Faster! Oh, winding Faster, open the faster! With such a strong wind up there, I think we have to lower the centre of gravity a bit.

169
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
The kite's all right, Papa!

170
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,919
Hmm, maybe it would take me with it.

171
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's it! I suppose that's to stop it from spinning around, is it snorke? Yes, that's right!

172
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hmm...

173
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What is it?

174
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Listen, I'm gonna ride that kite!

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What did you say?

176
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I think it's going to be okay now.

177
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If I hold on really tight,

178
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I think I could have a wonderful ride on that kite.

179
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yes, maybe it'd be wonderful while you're up in the sky,

180
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
but you've seen how fast it can come down again.

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But the snork just said it won't fall down again.

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Even so!

183
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm gonna do it.

184
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,580
But no one must see me or they might try again. But the snork just said it won't fall down again.

185
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,779
Even so!

186
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,179
I'm gonna do it.

187
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,019
But no one must see me or they might try to stop me if they guess what I'm up to.

188
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,480
Oh, please don't do it.

189
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,320
Shh!

190
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,120
What are you doing?

191
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,419
Listen carefully.

192
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:58,419
Yes.

193
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,159
When we fly the kite next time...

194
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,600
Huh?

195
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,000
What are you two whispering about?

196
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We weren't, Snork Maiden,

197
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I was just saying to Snif that the kite wouldn't fall down again.

198
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It won't, Snork is fixed it!

199
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But you can't be absolutely sure!

200
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And you'll be holding the kite, won't you, Snif?

201
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Me?

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Now then, do you want to do it, Moomin?

203
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes, and this time I'll let out all the line.

204
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And Snif, you could hold it up, okay?

205
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes, that's fine.

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No!

207
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,559
I'm counting on you, sniff.

208
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,559
And so am I, sniff.

209
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,559
Hmm.

210
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:46,000
Are you sure you'll be alright? Of course I will, silly.

211
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Well I'm not so sure.

212
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Why don't you keep your eyes closed then?

213
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Good idea.

214
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay, now let's do it when I say ready.

215
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hi.

216
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Ready! Yeah! Oh!

217
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh!

218
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh!

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh!

220
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh!

221
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh!

222
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh!

223
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh!

224
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh!

225
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh!

226
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:42,200
Oh! Oh! Oh

227
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,559
That's it that's all of the line

228
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's very high must be some wind up there. It's flying really well, isn't it?

229
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Certainly is. Oh! What's that? Let's see, there's something very strange happening on that kite.

230
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Huh! What is it? I can't see properly from here.

231
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I saw something.

232
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Could it be a bird, maybe?

233
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The kite is turned again, but it wasn't a bird.

234
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Or a twig or something, then.

235
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I doubt it.

236
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Can you see the back of the kite from where you are, Sniff?

237
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
No, Mom and Mama, because my eyes are closed.

238
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh. I think I know who it is.

239
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Little Mai.

240
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What?

241
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,600
No, I haven't seen all my fur.

242
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,200
She seems to have disappeared.

243
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,399
Don't ask me anything.

244
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,399
I know nothing at all about it.

245
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,399
Sniff, what do you mean?

246
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,000
No, she was dead set on riding the it. Sniff, what do you mean?

247
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
No, she was dead set on riding the kite. I couldn't stop her.

248
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What?

249
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Moment, bring it down very slowly.

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Huh?

251
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Take it easy, moving. That wind is strong strong it could break the line.

252
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But that was what a grand was best stream.

253
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's the knot I wore in the board knot.

254
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The warmth between our line and the bit that was still hanging from the kite when we found it.

255
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:44,320
The knot is fine if the knot is another method. Oh

256
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Hang on tight little Marl. That wind is getting stronger. Oh, this is more scarier than I thought.

257
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'll just have to hang on as best as I can.

258
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Don't move around so much.

259
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I can't help it.

260
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's almost down.

261
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm going to take a little more. I can't move. Don't move around so much.

262
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I can't help it.

263
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's almost down.

264
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What?

265
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's the open.

266
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Come on.

267
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Jeff, get up over.

268
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
All right.

269
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Snort, play yourself together.

270
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yes, all right.

271
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
She's being blown away towards Lonely Mountain.

272
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Snort me out.

273
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Ooh, I do hope little My really is indestructible.

274
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Where in the world is this guy taking me?

275
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
All lonely mountains, I'm a long way from home.

276
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Little My! Little Mai!

277
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Now she's going towards the forest of witches!

278
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
She'll be alright if she fell into a tree, wouldn't she?

279
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I can't see her, there's no sign of her!

280
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Well, I'm almost sure she was heading this way.

281
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What is it, Sniff?

282
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Imagine she might have fallen somewhere, she might be lying there waiting for help.

283
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh, stop imagining things, Sniff.

284
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
She's still up there. I'm sure of it.

285
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Huh?

286
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What is it, Papa?

287
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I saw something up there.

288
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Little Mai?

289
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
No, Sniff.

290
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,299
No, it looked more like the hobg goblin riding his panther through the sky.

291
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,299
Really?

292
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:49,299
Did you see that? Did you?

293
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:51,299
You found me lying.

294
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,799
No, the hob goblin.

295
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,799
Then it was him.

296
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,500
Forget the hob goblin. We're looking for little lion.

297
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:26,000
All you can think of is the hob goblin. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, I'm not going to sleep. I'm not going to sleep. I'm not going to sleep.

298
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm not going to sleep.

299
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm not going to sleep.

300
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm not going to sleep.

301
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm not going to sleep.

302
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm not going to sleep.

303
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm not going to sleep.

304
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm not going to sleep.

305
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm not going to sleep.

306
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm not going to sleep. I'm not going to sleep. I'm not going to sleep. Where could she be?

307
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
This is no good. We'll never find her wondering about like this.

308
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Moomin over here.

309
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You found her?

310
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There she is.

311
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Try to cheer up, Snork Maiden. I'll try.

312
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Don't worry, Snork Maiden.

313
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Movement Pupp will find her for sure.

314
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Eh?

315
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Mama, Snork Maiden!

316
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Feel the light. Mama, snork maiden! Oh, I'm so glad to see you, but I just knew you'd be alright.

317
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,400
Like Moomin Mama said, little lie really is indestructible, but just possibly it served her right to have her hair pulled.

318
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,599
Mmm, there's still no sign of little My?

319
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,599
No.

320
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:08,000
Be careful, Momen!

321
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Doom!

322
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What the fuck?

323
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Hang on, Momen! Help me, Momen, Papa!

324
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Finally, the name was rescued too.

325
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,900
But he almost certainly had a fine worst scare than the

326
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:46,000
blind. Leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

327
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
They're always happy and goes at play

328
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The movements are having fun day after day

329
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The movements

330
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The movements

331
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The movements The moon, the moon
