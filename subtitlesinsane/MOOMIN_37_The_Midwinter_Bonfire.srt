They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm not sure.

00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There was the moments, there was the moments During his long winter sleep, Mumin had a dream. And strangely enough, he dreamt that he was sleeping.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Mummann! Mummann! Mummann!

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Huh?

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Felicia! Felicia! Wow! You can fly on the broomstick now!

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's right! I'm a fully fledged witch now, Mummann! Alicia, wow, you can fly on the broomstick now.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's right, I'm a fully fledged witch now, woman.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Wait, give me a ride, Alicia. Can't do that.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, don't be mean, Alicia, because someone's already riding with me.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oops, man, it's me.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Little boy, would you mind if we went a little higher, Alicia?

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Sure. Oh, wow little higher, Alicia? Sure.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, wow!

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Higher, Alicia!

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Keep it going!

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, wow!

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What?

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, please, listen!

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Come back!

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Please, give me a ride, Nick!

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hahahaha!

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh!

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh!

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah!

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,919
Wow! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

36
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,439
Oh, thank you, Moon.

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,400
Well, you give me a right now. Come on, now.

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,240
Oh!

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,080
Eh!

40
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,919
Ah!

41
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,000
Ah! Oh! Eh! Huh? Uh-huh!

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Uh-huh!

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Uh-huh!

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Momen Valley's really beautiful from up here.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes, lovely!

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Whoa!

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh!

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, at least you'd be careful.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Don't do things like that.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,800
We're not doing anything, Momen! A little boy, it least you'd be careful. Don't do things like that. What are you talking about? We're not doing anything, movement.

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,199
A little moody. It's you again.

54
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,699
No wonder the broom is shaking so much.

55
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:14,699
How do you like it? I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?

56
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:17,900
Where did you get this broom from, little moody?

57
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,500
I've brooded from the wits.

58
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,300
I borrowed it.

59
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,300
For a while.

60
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,500
That's the wits, isn't it?

61
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Looks like it.

62
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,000
Maybe we better get out of here. You're right. Stop. You two little bees. For a while. That's the winch, isn't it? Looks like it.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Maybe we better get out of here.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're right.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Stop!

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You two little bees, give me back my brum at once.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No!

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You have your own room.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You winches should learn how to share.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But there's only one who's just a spare.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I want my veil from back right now.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Finders, keepers, it's my broom.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Cut out a brum.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,039
Huh, why don't you take a closer look at it?

76
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,259
That's not a broom.

77
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,180
What do you mean?

78
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,979
This is not a broom.

79
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:51,979
Oh!

80
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:52,979
Oh!

81
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,979
Oh!

82
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:55,979
Hey!

83
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:56,979
Hey!

84
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:57,979
Hey!

85
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:58,979
Oh!

86
00:03:58,979 --> 00:03:59,979
Oh!

87
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:00,979
Oh!

88
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:01,979
Oh, my!

89
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:02,979
Hey!

90
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:03,979
Moomin!

91
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:04,979
You alright, little my?

92
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:05,400
Little my isn't here, Moomin hey! Moomin! You alright, little my?

93
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,599
Little my isn't here, Moomin.

94
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, oh, oh, I must have been dreaming.

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,879
You were yelling out loud.

96
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,120
Oh, I'm so sorry.

97
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,919
I didn't mean to wake you up, Snorkman.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Can you see anything? Only snow. Everything's so light. Yes, the moon is up.

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, what an eerie light.

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Spring hasn't arrived yet, has it?

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Not yet.

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Everybody else is still asleep then?

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes, most of them anyway.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Wendr with my brother still up.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Well, he did say before we started hybrinating

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
he wanted to finish his blueprints before spring if he could. Yes, most of them anyway. Wonder if my brother's still up. Well, he did say before we started hybrinating,

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
he wanted to finish his blueprints before spring, if he could.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I hope he'll succeed this time.

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
When he go out?

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Huh?

112
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Outside, just to see what the snow looks like.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, no. I don't really feel like it.

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,100
It's nice and warm here. Why don't we sleep till spring like the others?

115
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,100
Spring is still a long way off.

116
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Guess you're right.

117
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:49,720
It is nice and warm in here. I'm so very hungry moment. Your mother's raspberry juice is really the best.

118
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,040
It is, isn't it?

119
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,920
Everybody said that last winter too.

120
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
A moment.

121
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
Yeah?

122
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
I have a funny feeling.

123
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,720
Someone is watching us and I don't like you one little bit.

124
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,920
Moment poppig had explained it.

125
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
I'm sure.

126
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Of course someone's watching.

127
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
What the hell?

128
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
And how do you know?

129
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,000
Two-ticky told me all about it last winter snort maiden. I'm sure. Of course someone's watching. What? But who?

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And how do you know?

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,639
Two-ticky told me all about it last winter, Snort Maiden.

132
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,399
She doesn't hibernate, you know?

133
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,759
She lives in our bathhouse and watches over us in the winter.

134
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,000
She said that many things are too shy to show themselves.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,480
Oh, have you seen them yourself?

136
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Sort of.

137
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Except they were invisible, of course.

138
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Like under the sink.

139
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,000
Or in the clock, maybe. Except they were invisible, of course, like under the sink.

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Or in the clock, maybe.

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
In the empty fireplace and other dark corners of the room, I can feel it.

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Did you actually look anywhere for them?

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, no. They'd be very upset. It's better not to let them know we know where they are.

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I wonder what these things look like.

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Some of them look very much like us, too, Tiki said.

146
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,720
Old ancestors of ours from way back, she thinks.

147
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Some of them look like us, she said.

148
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,120
Well, I've never seen them for myself.

149
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,720
I wonder if there is good looking as we are.

150
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,560
Wouldn't it be a good idea to stay up and wait for the sunrise?

151
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,699
A great idea!

152
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,639
Now, don't say anything to scare them, but this is one of the movement's ancestors from way back.

153
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,500
Is him morning already?

154
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,540
Are you sure?

155
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,540
I think so.

156
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,379
There are no clouds, so why can't we see the sun?

157
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:28,000
I guess maybe the sun doesn't come up at all this time of the year.

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Mom and I don't like this.

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
I don't like you one little bit.

160
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,759
You silly little girl.

161
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,759
What do you need this for?

162
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,920
Please grandma, I won't be long, I promise.

163
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
What are you talking about?

164
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,480
Is if you could fly a broom, get back back to me at once.

165
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,879
No, I won't give it back.

166
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,079
Now give me back that broom and don't be silly.

167
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,360
How many times from sight tell you

168
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,639
you can't go visiting Moomin Valley?

169
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,279
But it's so boring here.

170
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,079
I want some company grandma.

171
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,560
Come on, Brum, fly off.

172
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Take me to Moomin Valley.

173
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,000
Up, up, up. Help me up grandma, please. I'm going to get a moment Valley.

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Help me up grandma, please.

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Alright, my girl, I'll help you up, shall I?

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't believe it! I'm floating!

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, this! How fun! This is great! Wait!

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, I'm falling!

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh!

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, hey!

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh, how about that of these?

182
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll find the bird around here.

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh!

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh, to bury things a bit, how about this?

185
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh, no!

186
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Stop the drum, Grandma!

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Please!

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Oh!

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Come on, you wanted to ride on the brum didn't you?

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You first saw the bike?

191
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, we did.

192
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Mom, please don't!

193
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Hm.

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If you want to learn to fly on this brum, Alicia, you can forget all about those dreaded movements and really start studying.

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's hard work, you know, young woman.

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You must learn to concentrate.

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Hey, you up there!

198
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Are you making fun of me, too?

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh, I can't go. I'm going to have to go. Are you up there? Are you making fun of me, too?

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, I can't climb down there. Of course you can. Even if you fall, you can't hurt yourself on this soft snow.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't shake the ladder, Moment! This is scary!

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Slowly does it. Take it easy and don't look down.

203
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Maybe going out wasn't such a good idea after all.

204
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
We can always change our minds and go back to sleep, you know.

205
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
See, you've made it.

206
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's very cool though to hear moving, but I'd rather like it.

207
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh, this is the roof over the front door, isn't it?

208
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes, and everything will be snowed up now to spring.

209
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,679
Oh no, what's happened to our firewood?

210
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,279
What's the matter?

211
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,080
There's not much wood left in here.

212
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,840
Someone else must be burning it.

213
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,679
Yes, but who and for what I wonder?

214
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,759
I can feel it.

215
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,240
We're not alone in this forest.

216
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm sure someone's watching us.

217
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
All those winter creatures. No, I don't think it's them.

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The grog.

219
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Goodness me, look how big she gets in the winter time.

220
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Move in! I'm scared!

221
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,000
It'll be alright. Girl, stop right there!

222
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,840
Don't come any closer if you please.

223
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,279
You're much, much too cold for us, you see.

224
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,480
You could freeze a stiff, you know.

225
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,000
Is it possible that you get lonely all by yourself?

226
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't think there's anything we can do to help you know, not without fur coats and earmuffs and worn gloves anyway.

227
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:31,500
We must go! Oh.

228
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,000
Someone's been stealing our firewood. I wonder what they're doing with it. Nothing bad. There's no doubt about that.

229
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:58,320
Must've been several people did this. Yes!

230
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,960
We had a lot of fun here in the summer. Remember?

231
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,559
Well, the she is still here round the ice.

232
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,340
I hope.

233
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:08,580
Too, Tiki! Too, Tiki!

234
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,740
There's no one here. Are you sure? Look for yourself.

235
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,840
I know they're invisible, but I'm a schrooom I sin here.

236
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,919
Hard to tell. With things you can't see.

237
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,500
Oh! What is it?

238
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:28,500
It felt like something scampering on my back.

239
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,200
That's all right. It must be one of the shrewel mice.

240
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,799
Moman! Moman!

241
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,100
Oh, where could he have gone?

242
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:48,000
My goodness! I've never seen anything quite like this before!

243
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Hi, it's good to see you!

244
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You're right! She's fishing!

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Hi, Tukki! Hello, Tukki!

246
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So this winner's not made in woke up too, huh?

247
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I walk her up by mistake!

248
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You know that spring is still a long way off, don't you?

249
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,360
I thought it must be seeing there's no sun at all.

250
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,000
But the sun is gonna come back tomorrow, Momen.

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Tomorrow?

252
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,600
It's Nord made me was so worried about the sun not showing.

253
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,919
The sun will rise tomorrow, Momen, but it'll go down very soon.

254
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,000
To take you know, I think there must be records in Moonwind Valley.

255
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Records in Winter?

256
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,440
There's an enormous pile of firewood up on the hillside.

257
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,600
Oh, I know.

258
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,120
It took a long time to collect that wood.

259
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,840
But some of it belongs to us.

260
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,440
That doesn't really surprise me, though, Momen.

261
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,039
I'm afraid the winner creatures unfree careful about ownership.

262
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:39,919
They need a lot.

263
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,879
So if they see it, they take it.

264
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,919
It's for their big winner, Bonfire.

265
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,200
A bonfire?

266
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,299
Yes, and now your firewood can take part in the big celebration.

267
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:53,100
They light it every window to make sure the sun comes back, you know.

268
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,100
Oh, you mean otherwise the sun wouldn't come back to a ticket?

269
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Well, since they always light it on this day, you don't really know, do you?

270
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,299
Tonight you might see the winner creatures.

271
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:07,000
Okay, we come along as well, too, Tiki.

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yes, you can, if you sit quietly and don't scare them in any way.

273
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Wonderful, you're coming along too, aren't you?

274
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Of course!

275
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Stop! Help me!

276
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Someone shouting for help?

277
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Who could it be?

278
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, wait! Get away from me!

279
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I didn't do it on purpose!

280
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I didn't mean any harm.

281
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
If you don't leave me alone, Grandma will turn you into a towed.

282
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,720
Oh, it's so cold!

283
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,240
Go away, please!

284
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
Ah!

285
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
Ah!

286
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
Ah!

287
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
Ah!

288
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
Oh!

289
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
Grow! Leave her alone!

290
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,480
What are you doing, Grog?

291
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,000
No, man her alone! What are you doing, Grog?

292
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No, man! Alicia!

293
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Now listen, Grog.

294
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Why can't you be nice to her?

295
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Alicia is one of my friends.

296
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
She was just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis.

297
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I nearly bumped into her, but I didn't touch her.

298
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That's all right, Alicia.

299
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Tell me, Grog, what's gotten into you?

300
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Why are you so nasty to such a sweet little girl?

301
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It isn't like you at all.

302
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I must have startled her, I guess.

303
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And I did apologize and all, but it made no difference.

304
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
This is really very odd.

305
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Then I asked if she had seen you,

306
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and that's when she started to get mad at me.

307
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But she doesn't even know me.

308
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's a mystery.

309
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,679
Whatever's the matter with you, Groke.

310
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,519
Oh, I was so scared.

311
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,919
I'm so glad you've come to see us.

312
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,480
So am I, women. Somehow I felt certain you so glad you've come to see us. So am I, Moments.

313
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,120
Somehow I felt certain you hadn't gone into hibernation yet.

314
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,720
But what did your grandmother say?

315
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,559
Nothing because I didn't tell her I was coming.

316
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,159
Thank you for chasing off that terrible monster.

317
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:00,000
The Grog hasn't actually ever attacked anyone.

318
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,480
Well, maybe she doesn't like the look of Alicia.

319
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,399
Snork maiden.

320
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,960
It's really a mystery to me why the gropes here at all.

321
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,639
She was here looking for a moment no doubt.

322
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,480
Was she?

323
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,840
He suddenly become very popular.

324
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,840
Huh? You don't mean...

325
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:25,000
Ha! What? What? What? What? What?

326
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What?

327
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What?

328
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What?

329
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What?

330
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What?

331
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What?

332
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What?

333
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What?

334
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What?

335
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What?

336
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What?

337
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What?

338
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What?

339
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What?

340
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What?

341
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What?

342
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What?

343
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What?

344
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What?

345
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What? What? What? What? What? not serious, it's out of the question. It's her ridiculous idea, don't be so silly.

346
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,480
Where's all that drumming noise coming from?

347
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,279
From the invisible shroom ice.

348
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,359
How long before everybody arrives?

349
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,319
Oh, they're here already, Moomin, all around us.

350
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,319
They are?

351
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,319
Where?

352
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,319
I can't see them.

353
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,799
Are they really invisible?

354
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:24,559
I can't see them either, but I can feel their presence all around me.

355
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,119
But she's been studying witchcraft, hasn't she?

356
00:17:28,140 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm sure you and Moomin will be able to feel their presence quite soon. Oh Oh! I can see some of them looking all over there! Oh!

357
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh!

358
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh!

359
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh!

360
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh!

361
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh!

362
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh!

363
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh!

364
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh!

365
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh!

366
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Oh!

367
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh!

368
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh!

369
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I can see some of them looking all over there!

370
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Oh!

371
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh!

372
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh!

373
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I can't see them too, you guys.

374
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Do you think you can tell me if I can't see all of them?

375
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Well, we can never see them all.

376
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't understand how did you know earlier on the Shroom Lice were playing the drums.

377
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,220
I just know because they sometimes play the drums. We see all of them. Well, we can never see them all. I don't understand how did you know earlier on the

378
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,220
Shroom Bites were playing the drums. I just know because they sometimes play them in the batch house as well.

379
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,420
What a wonderful celebration! Isn't it lucky I came over here?

380
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:07,000
If I had not have missed a most memorable evening. What's going on here?

381
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The grog.

382
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What?

383
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What's she going on here?

384
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
She must be looking for a movement again, I guess.

385
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
No, I guess.

386
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
No, I think she just wants to warm herself by the fire.

387
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What's she doing?

388
00:19:47,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Well, that's the end of the mid-winter bonfire.

389
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Pull Grog she freezes everything she touches.

390
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,200
Whatever she sits on, even the hottest bonfire, turns freezing cold in a matter of seconds.

391
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,299
Well, at least she's managed to save some of our wood.

392
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,500
Go! Hold on tight, now Snorkemaid, and I'm be careful!

393
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I can't wait to get into bed. I wanted to stay up until the sun came up again.

394
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But I don't know if I could keep awake till then.

395
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So long till spring, man, room, man.

396
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Goodbye.

397
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And take care, Alicia.

398
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I will, room, and the moon will light my way back.

399
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
This time the movements have gone too far. Something must be done. I'll teach them a lesson they'll never forget.

400
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
They won't get the better at me!

401
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Now what does the witch mean by teach them a lesson? That sounds very ominous.

402
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Let's hope at least that she lets them sleep till next spring. We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

403
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
They're always happy and goes at play

404
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The moments are having fun day after day, the movements

405
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The movements, the movements The Moons
