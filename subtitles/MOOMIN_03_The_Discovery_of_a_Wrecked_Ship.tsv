312920	319920	a leaf boat look it sails on the river just like a real one

363920	368720	there's a cave just a little bit further along this path why don't you two girls wait for a
368720	375560	sec we won't be long but if you can walk to it why on earth climb to it difficult for a girl to

428480	438320	what I don't like yes exactly a place with no one living in it is really scary I think we must be
438320	445000	right above the cave here maybe I can't find a hole though let's look a bit more over that way moving
445000	455560	wow I've never seen a shell like this before look at that one they must be worth a fortune come

530280	534040	you can't scare me like that no one lives here who want to live here anyway it's dark and cold
535640	540840	it's moment and snuffkin they've climbed out and we can hear their voices in the distance

617720	619720	oh
626200	633800	movement what's happened talk to me movement are you all right oh I don't know I think so
633800	639240	my bottom's a little bit sore though I'm sure I heard somebody scream just now well the
639240	645880	hamilin was down here having a nap the hamilin if this is another of your games movement I don't like
645880	650920	Mr. Hamilin we were climbing down from the top we didn't know you were asleep that's not quite right
650920	656600	I wasn't asleep I wasn't at all comfortable you know well what were you doing here then well
656600	663080	to tell you the truth I really haven't been quite myself lately you haven't lost any more rare
663080	670760	stabs have you Mr. Hamilin on the contrary movement I have them all even the rarest every single one
670760	678840	then what's wrong that's good isn't it I mean my collection is complete I know one in the
678840	685240	world has a better stamp collection than you have Mr. Hamilin no of course not mine is perfect there
685240	691560	isn't a stamp I haven't got rare ones old ones misprinted ones I have them all I still don't
691560	697720	understand there's no challenge nothing to search for you're too young and you don't collect stamps
697720	706200	oh dear me dear me I'm beginning to understand he's not a collector anymore he's got all the stamps
706200	713000	he could ever want that's the trouble it's not half as much fun that's why you're sad isn't it Mr.
713000	723000	Hamilin yes it is no fun no fun at all now I understand I can see why you're upset and me falling
723000	731400	on top of you like that didn't really help did it not exactly moment look who was taking a
731400	738680	nap in the cave oh it's you Mr. Hamilin so it must have been his snoring that we heard what a noise
738680	745320	he was making I'd never ever snore you certainly do
749160	762360	Robbys look if you promise not to tell anyone I'll take you to see something very special what is it
762360	782200	I think it could be repaired of course it could easy but you know you can't always tell the keel
782200	788280	doesn't look too good yes we could take it out to see a no time the sales got holes in it hey I
788280	796760	can't find any owners you can paddle all steer look out friends it's going over
803400	806200	hey hang on everybody
806520	818440	I've lost my confidence and it makes me feel very unhappy well it can happen to anyone you know
818440	826120	even to you well not much of course lucky you I just don't know what to do how can I get it back
826200	833240	there must be a way it's hard to say everybody's different but with me it just happens
837560	843320	I don't think I'll ever invent anything again perhaps I'll have a break from my memoirs too
845160	850440	tea time oh dear what's the matter with you too you look a bit down in the dance you know I might
850440	866120	have been a bit overconfident me too I think there's no need to yell we can hear you watch
866120	873480	the matter sniff we found a boat on the beach coming have a look a shipwreck washed up on the
873480	880680	shore it's not a wreck and it's got a white sail oh we're going to repair it and then it'll be ours
881800	886840	all right I'm coming come on snort let's take a look at this boat it could be just the thing
886840	893160	to cheer us both up so it's got a sail a white sail you say that could be extremely interesting
893160	904680	hmm it's a sturdy little craft is nicely built well designed she's abandoned so does that we can keep her
910200	915960	well it seems to be in pretty good condition except for the hole in the bottom you know maybe
915960	922200	that's why she was abandoned here you could be right stuff can finders keepers you guys of course it
922200	927160	makes it our boat you'd have to wait to see if anyone claims it first little mine what shall we do
927160	934680	then papa well first things first we must repair the hole and then tire up securely in case there's a
934680	944840	storm absolutely then if the owner comes we are to give her back to him mine you might know she's here
945480	952600	so what are we going to do when we've repaired her oh it's bad for boats not to be yours don't we
952600	964200	could sail the seven seas I'd be happy just to explore around here don't worry snort maiden if we
964200	972120	get big waves we can sail between them isn't that right moment papa well in a way now come on let's
972120	980680	get to work how about you snort will you help us yes of course can I do anything for you moment papa
980680	985960	yes if you'd like to Mr. Himmelon well I'm afraid I'm not much of a builder but if there is
985960	993800	something I could do well let's get her out of the water first shall we and we'll need some
993800	1002280	big logs to go under her I think ten should be enough I'll be so let's go prime she'll need to
1002280	1009800	be safe to work on so we'll want something strong to keep her upright as well and lots of tools
1009800	1015160	now go home and get some and I think we'll need a bucket and a shovel or I'll come with you
1015160	1021320	help you choose yes you go I'll stay and keep guard in case the owner comes back
1045480	1053480	sleep well man the top cells what
1066040	1072680	are they all in bed my dear yes dear sleeping like logs I'm not surprised they all work very very
1072680	1079880	hard today I can't wait until the boat's ready and we can sail off somewhere my dear will go anywhere
1079880	1085800	in the world you like anywhere at all you've only got to say enough will jolly will go it doesn't
1085800	1093800	have to be far dear let's get to bed too we've got an early start the morning oh intellectuals
