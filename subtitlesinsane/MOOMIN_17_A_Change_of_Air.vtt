00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
However, this lazy lifestyle, no matter how pleasant it might be, does not suit everyone.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Oh!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Yes?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Would you like a cup of coffee, dear?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Yes.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I think I need one, Mama.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Oh, dear, is it your memoirs?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm stuck.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Ah, can I help?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
How can I create in this?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
In what?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In this sleepy atmosphere, and I've also come to a boring part.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
When was that?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The time I wrote poem is.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.199
Were they any good?

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.599
No.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.599
Well, miss that bit out then.

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.599
I can't.

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.599
I must put it down for posterity. It is my duty.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.599
But how can I get inspiration here in this place

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.599
when nothing ever happens, nothing ever happens at all?

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.599
Oh, I think this means another adventure.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.719
Yes, Mama, that I need it to be big, exciting, and frightening.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.639
Mama, what's the matter? Are you all right?

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.759
Your father says that because nothing ever happens here,

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:20.879
he can't write.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.360
So I'm looking for an adventure for him.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.759
Can you think of anything?

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.000
He wants it to be big, exciting, and frightening.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Does he want something really exciting?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Yes, dear, I'm afraid so.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I think I could manage that.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
That looks like the footprint of a huge monster.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:25.500
Oh, it's a good feeling giving others a sight-man. Yeah, I was harder than I thought.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.500
Oi! Sleepy heads!

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Wake up everybody, Mom and Papa! Quickly get up! Mom and Mama, a monster! You've been visited by a monster!

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Wake up before you eatin' alive!

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Come on, hurry! Hurry!

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
My, what huge tracks!

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:51.199
Ah, that should keep them guessing for a while!

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.600
Hmm, it could be a monster from the depths of the ocean.

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.800
Something's not right here.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.000
Don't you think it's a bit odd that it came directly to Moome House?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.399
Yeah.

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:06.500
Well, look at the footsteps! They go in a straight line!

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.500
Someone must have told it to go to Moome House!

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.300
And they're only going one way!

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.800
Look, there are tiny footsteps going back to the sea!

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.800
Oh, now that the monster must still be here then!

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.800
Oh, well, not necessarily!

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.399
Retracing one's own footsteps is the sign of an advanced intelligence.

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:33.399
Stepping back exactly the way you came. The tough question is why would the monster do that?

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:37.199
One is led to believe that it wants us to think it's still here.

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.600
Well, in fact, it has gone back to wherever it came from.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.399
Fiddled battle is my dear mother would say?

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:47.000
But why would it want us to think that, Papa?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It's a spy.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Oh, it's a spy.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Something it shouldn't.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It'd hardly be a good spy if we knew

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
if they have to sneak in and out.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I think it's still here.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I can feel it. You know what I mean?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Perhaps tonight.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Tonight? What about tonight? That's when they'll attack. It's gone back to give its report.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
How do you know that, Papa?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Well, obviously, that's why it still wants us to believe it's here.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Mama! Mama! Yes? What is it, Mum?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Something terrible is going to happen.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
A monster is going to attack us tonight!

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And Papa's excited about it!

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Oh, good. That's nice for him.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Hurry everyone!

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I expect the monster will be here soon.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Oh, poor!

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Now hold it still.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This is gonna be a good barricade, don't you think?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Hmm, we'd better make sure it's big enough.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
It's hardly any fun to tall-playing tricks on them. They're so gullible!

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
If we catch the monster, we can sell it to a zoo. I'll handle a sale, of course.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
I'd rather tame it and keep it as a pet.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Well, you could ride on it to go pig-nicking.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Oh no.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000
All right, now for the moat. Here we go. Hope the well's got enough water in it.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It'll be able to swim in this, Papa.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Yes, it'll remind you to the sea and keep it calm.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:50.120
This is fresh water, Papa. We'd better put some salt in it. Good idea, Momen. We'll plant some seaweed and put some rocks in too, and then it'll feel really at home.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.920
I wonder when it'll come.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.920
I don't know, but I can feel in my bones. It'll be tonight.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.120
And we keep watching till it comes? Of course we will, constantly.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.000
What if it doesn't come till tomorrow night,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.639
or the night after that?

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:14.000
It might be a long wait, so we'll take it in turns

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.560
and remember everybody.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.120
The safety of Moon in Valley relies upon our vigilance.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.000
We must be ready. Ready. Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Huh?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Huh?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Huh?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Huh?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Huh?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Huh?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Huh?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Huh?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Huh?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Huh?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Huh?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Huh?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Huh?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Huh?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Huh?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Huh?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Huh?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Huh?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Huh?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.539
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Look at what those fools have done. It was worth all the trouble. Oh.

00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:46.539
Oh.

00:08:46.539 --> 00:08:47.539
Oh.

00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:48.539
Oh.

00:08:48.539 --> 00:08:51.860
Look, they put down food.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.860
His bait, moving papa must be worn out.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.960
Well, I'll take the food anyway.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.460
Carefully, does it?

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.620
Don't want to wake up the guard.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.059
This is great.

00:09:02.059 --> 00:09:03.059
Ugh.

00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:04.059
Ugh.

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:12.000
Ugh. I've managed to play a really good trick on the stupid moments and they've given me a slap-up meal as well.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Oh, what's that?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
The monsters here shut the gate.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
There's the rope. Quickly!

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
No, no! Stop! Wake up, everybody!

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
To wash!

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Oh, no!

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
No, it's only me!

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Big room! I'll get it!

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Oh, what?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Oh, where is it?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
There's no monster only me!

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Please, it's me! It's me, Stinky!

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.720
Stinky? Well well it sounds like stinky

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:53.419
Be careful everybody it's a baby monster I'm not a monster please help me I made the

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Why don't you let Stinky go?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
It really is him, you know.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It is?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Yes, it was Stinky.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And he really did make those footprints.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
How do you know that Snuffkin?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
I was fishing off the shore last night when I saw him digging the holes.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:47.000
The little rascal was at it for hours and hours. Why don't you come inside Stinky? This is great! It was very good of you to make the footprints.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Papa hasn't had so much fun at ages.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I'm glad it was hard work and I lost all my hair too!

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Well, Miss Jeff isn't always easy, you know.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
You can say that again!

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.000
This is delicious!

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
No!

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Papa, are you alright? Yes, thank you, Mummian. Mama.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Yes, dear?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Shh. I've got something important to tell you.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
What is it, Papa?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
A secret in my mind is made up.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Of course, dear. I'm going to tell you. What is it, Papa?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
A secret in my mind is made up.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Of course, dear.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I'm going to run away on an adventure trip.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
That's nice for you.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
It's a trip without a destination full of mystery,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
hazards and hardships, and you're coming to, Mama.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Oh, splendid.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Shall we take all the children or just move in?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
No, no children. That would be the same as here, only somewhere else. We'll run away.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Run away, mumin, Papa?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I'll be an adventurer again, just as I was in my lost youth, and with you by my side will have adventure romance.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
All we desire, the sun, the stars.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.200
But what about mumin? He'll be frantic.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.279
You won't, and it's time he learned to stand on his own feet.

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:30.360
Fan for himself, become a man.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.759
We can't protect him forever, you know.

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:34.559
He's big enough to be left by himself.

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:46.000
I'm on, Mama.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Oh, just a milk-mout-papa.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Well, you can't take anything more with us.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
No, I know, but I forgot to write down where the sugar is.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
If they can't find it, they'll just have to do without.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
But then they won't be able to make cakes and the tea will taste awful.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Oh, and they'll never find this cinnamon on them. Where shall I leave it?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Goodness, Mama, cinnamon I ask you when the unknown is calling to us.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I should have gone on my own, indeed, I should. But then what good is an adventure when you can't say who?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
That was a close shave to someone after us.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Is there anything wrong, Papa?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.559
No, everything is fine, but we must leave before dawn.

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:30.559
All right.

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.559
We have a long way to go.

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:36.559
How far and where? It's very dark, you know.

00:13:36.559 --> 00:13:49.000
Yes, isn't it? We'll just follow our feet and they say this way. Hey.

00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:54.600
Oh, my God.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.399
Good morning, mama.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Mama, where are you? What's the matter, Moomin? My parents are missing. Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. That's a bit of a problem I'm getting hungry.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
I need my breakfast.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I have to start the day with a good meal.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I'm starving.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Me too.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
What's the matter, Moomin?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
My parents are missing.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Are you sure?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Of course I'm sure.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
That's a bit of a problem I'm getting hungry.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I need my breakfast.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.740
I have to start the day with a good meal. I'm starving. Me too!

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:36.580
Don't worry, Moomin. I'm sure that Moomin, Mama and Moomin Papa will be back home very soon.

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:39.000
But where could they have gone to, Snuffkin?

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.940
No idea. Have they left a note? Have you had your breakfast yet, Moomin?

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.000
No, nothing. It's not the shame without Mama.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Cheer up, Moomin! You can have this fish.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And I'll come up to Moomin House and cook it especially for you, if you like.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Thanks, enough kin. But there are two cooks there already.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Little Mayan's sniff, a bull trying to cook.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I bet it fair, I bet it fair.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
This is great. There's lots of there, I bet it's there. This is great.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
There's lots of delicious things I want to try out.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Where are we, Papa?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
No idea, Mama.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Too dark to see anything at all.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
We've been gone for hours.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I think it should have been light by now.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Oh dear, we have to face it.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I'm afraid we're lost.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I'm sorry, Mama, but there it is.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Oh, what do you mean?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Well, in the dark we must have wandered into some caves.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Who knows how many different tunnels we took.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
It could be weeks before we find our way.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Little Miley, it's morning! Mind your own business. Little mind's burning.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Mind your own business, I might like burnt food.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
It's very nutritious. Watch your own cooking.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
It couldn't be any worse than the last lot you made for us.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Ha! I wonder where Moomin is. He likes my food.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
I'll get him to try it.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:26.000
He can try mine first. Now that I I practice it'll be perfect. Momen, I've got something for you! Mom! Mom! Mom!

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Mom!

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Mom!

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Mom!

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Mom!

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Mom!

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Mom!

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Mom!

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Mom!

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Mom!

00:16:44.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Mom! Mom! What was that?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Moment, Papa.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Wake up.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Moment, Papa. Oh! It tastes brackish! We must be quite near the sea.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:18:16.000
I'm going to have to go to the beach. I'm going to must be quite near the sea. That's a big one.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Gotcha! Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.799
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, I've never seen such a big fish movement.

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:49.599
Just wait till Papa sees it.

00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:52.720
Oh yes, moment Papa.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.720
This looks familiar.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.720
It's moment Fally isn't it?

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.079
Of course it is just outside the cave.

00:18:58.079 --> 00:18:59.079
Oh dear.

00:18:59.079 --> 00:19:02.240
I'm afraid that your father will be a bit disappointed.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.039
Where is he then?

00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:05.299
Well...

00:19:07.539 --> 00:19:09.539
He's gone, looking for adventure.

00:19:09.539 --> 00:19:11.140
Adventure? Where?

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.740
I don't really know. Somewhere.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.339
I could have gone with him.

00:19:16.339 --> 00:19:18.220
When's he coming home?

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.519
I'm afraid I don't know that either.

00:19:20.519 --> 00:19:23.720
You know Papa tonight, tomorrow night.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.839
Next Christmas, your guess is as good as mine, Moomin.

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:31.640
Wow, I bet he's having a great adventure right now.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.640
Hey, Mama?

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.359
Oh, oh, you...

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Mama? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, can you hear me? Oh! Goodness, the sea.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Oh, this looks like... Oh, it gets... oh, dear.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Terry, me, I don't...

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Oh, well, oh, my! my oh you see I'm in my middle.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Oh yeah of course I'm in my middle. Oh look, look it's Papa! Papa's back everyone!

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Uh huh!

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Hi, Papa!

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Ah, well, I'm back.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I'm so pleased to see you again.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.400
Thank you, Mama. Papa, how was your adventure?

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.000
Eh, unexpected.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Yes, that's what I'd say.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Unexpected. Any food.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Oh, yes. You can try mine first, Moomban Papa.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Oh, mine's the best. Try mine, Papa.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Oh, that's good. I'm starving.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Tell us about your adventure.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I love you.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Were you an mortal danger? Did you eat any rams? Yeah, I am supposed to. It your adventure. I love you. Were you an mortal, danger? Did you eat any rags?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
I am supposed to eat adventure, but...

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
I don't think Papa wants to talk about his adventure yet. Maybe later.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And that was the end of Mama and Papa's adventure.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
They didn't get far, but then you don't have to sometimes for things to happen.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Or at least for you to think they're happening. The movements. They're always happy and always at play.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
The movements.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
The movements.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:41.000
They love the laughter and they love the living.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:52.000
The movements. The living, the movements We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
They're always happy and goes at play

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:07.000
The moments I have in fun day after day, the movements The Move is the Move is the Move is
