    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're here for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They are the movements.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, what do you think?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm not sure.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm not sure.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. with me, they're for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.840
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land, you can fly

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:47.000
just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there was the moments

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
There was the moments, there was the moments

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:17.000
There was the moments, there was the moments Oh, my God.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Oh, no.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Oh, oh. Oh.

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.199
Oh. Oh Oh, oh. The witch has come to Moomin Valley.

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:17.360
What could she be up to this time?

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.800
Eldritch cabal assume! Eldritch cabal assume!

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.439
Eldritch cabal assume! Eldritch cabal assume!

00:02:23.439 --> 00:03:07.000
Eldritch cabal assume! Eldritch cabal assume! Eldritch cabal assume! Eldritch cabal assume! Elderscapella Zoom! Yeah, I must get a covered brown. What? The Great Thaw had come at last.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
The Moomin Valley.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I think I can smell spring.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Oh, I've never seen anything like this one before.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Hello there, Mr. Hemmielun.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Hello, Sniff, you're up early this year?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Yes, I think I've even beat Mom and do it.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It's a great day. Hello there Mr. Hemiellon. Hello Sniff, you're up early this year?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Yes, I think I've even beat Momen to it.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Is that so? Why are the Momen so late this year?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Momen, wake up! Sprig is here! It's time to wake up!

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.400
Momen! Maybe Snorkmaiden's easier to wake up! Sprig is here! It's time to wake up! Moment!

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.900
Maybe Snork made it easier to wake up.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400
Snork me in!

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.199
And I thought I was difficult to wake up. I must get closer.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
What are you doing, Sniff? What am I doing? You can see, can't you? Of course I can, but why are you climbing up that? Mom and his fart maintenance still asleep. I have to wake them up.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Why don't you go this way? It's easier!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Ugh! What I do now!

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Funny, even momentary.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I'm not going to be able to do it. Uh! What I do now!

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Funny even Mom and Mom is still asleep.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Wrong room.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Come on, wake up lazy bones.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Moment, spring has come.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
We'll look at that. Wake up, you sleepyhead. Oh, you really are impossible.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Moment, moment, moment. This is odd, even for a moment.

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:28.920
Open the window, little mind!

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.120
Was I scared?

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.680
Ooh, I haven't you opened them up!

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.560
I've tried, but they won't.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.199
You're kidding.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.160
No one can resist this little mime.

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:53.759
Wake up, oh man.

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.360
I know you're ticklish.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.879
Oh man, oh man!

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.040
I told you so.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Oh man, come on! I told you so. Moment!

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Come on!

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Ow!

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Ow!

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Ow!

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Ow!

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Ow!

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Ow!

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I can't stop.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
How strange.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
How sad.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
What do you mean?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I think... You know what? You don don't think, it's hard to tell.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
I was listening for his heartbeat.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
He's still breathing.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And snort made it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Wake up you slug of it!

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Snort made it!

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.199
They won't wake up. This is strange. Wake up, you slug of it! Stop, me!

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.399
They won't wake up.

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:48.519
This is strange.

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:49.920
Why don't we go and try the other?

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.360
Yes, why not?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.079
I hate it when others are asleep while I'm up.

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:56.720
But then I don't like it much the other way around either.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720
Do I sniff?

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.360
Moment drop up, please wake up.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.000
We've tried to wake up, Moment, but he won't. Wakey, Moment, mom, I breakfast time. Come on, Moment Pop, please wake up! We've tried to wake up, Moment, but he woo!

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Wakey, Moment, Moment breakfast time!

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Come on, Moment Pop, boy!

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Wake up! This is no use!

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Goodness, it seems the Moments are still hibernating.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And so is Snort Maiden. That's odd, she always wakes up even before me. Goodness, it seems the Moomins are still hibernating.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And so is Snort Maiden.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
That's odd, she always wakes up even before me.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Oh, Moomin' too, but this year it seems to be different.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.639
I'll go back home, and I'll come over again in a little while when the Moomin' family

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:38.639
will have woken up.

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:39.639
If they ever do.

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:40.639
Huh?

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:45.500
We've tried everything to wake them up short of buckets of water and there's no moving them.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.000
We've shouted and shook and pissed and tickled and stopped!

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Oh dear!

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
It's not just strange, it's ominous!

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Oh my, surely not.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Hello, everybody!

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
How is everyone?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
What is it?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
You all look very scared.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.199
Eh?

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.199
Still hibernating?

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.800
It's all very strange, have you lint?

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.600
Moment!

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.800
See?

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.000
Yes indeed.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
All we can really do. Who is waiting?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I suppose you're right.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Don't worry. The days are getting longer all the time now.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So the moment can't sleep much longer.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Unsnort maiden?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Cheat too, of course.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Bet you anything, moment wakes up when Snuffkin returns.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I think you're right, Sniff.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And then, one day about a week later,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:09:53.500
Snuffkin did come back from his yearly trip south. I Snowden! Snowden! Hmm.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Where's Moomin? He's in bad.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Moomin's still asleep.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:10.000
A sleep. They won't wake up no matter what you do.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
What do you think, Snuffkin?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I think they're very sick.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
That's a possibility.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Sleeping sickness, perhaps?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
It's very difficult to say.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
To me, though, if you want my honest opinion,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.379
I think somebody has cast a very nasty spell

00:10:26.379 --> 00:10:27.379
on them.

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:28.379
A spell?

00:10:28.379 --> 00:10:30.720
But who would do that?

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.720
I think I know.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.720
Huh?

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.360
Are you mean the witch?

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.519
Alice is grandmother, but why?

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:40.360
To tell you the truth, I haven't the biggest idea.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.879
How do we find out?

00:10:43.879 --> 00:10:45.600
I'll go to the forest and see her.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.600
And if she did cast a spell, do you think she'd tell you?

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.399
I really don't know, but we have to do something.

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:54.399
We can't just leave them sleeping here forever.

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:56.600
I'll go with you.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.799
I guess I better stay here to take care of things.

00:10:59.799 --> 00:11:03.000
Well, if they suddenly wake up, somebody needs to be here.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.700
Snuffkin.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.500
Huh?

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.500
That's him!

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.700
At last!

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.700
Moving.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.700
Moving?

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.700
Moving?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.500
He's dreaming.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.000
Just looking at him makes me feel sleepy.

00:11:20.299 --> 00:11:46.000
Moving, I promise to get this horrible spell cast off for you. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Oh, my God.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Oh, my God.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Oh, my God.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Oh, my God.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Oh, my God.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Oh, my God.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Where are you going?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I've done all the chores, even washed out your old push-in jars.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So where are you going? I've done all the chores, even washed out your old potion jars.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
So where are you going?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Spring is here, Grandma. I thought I'd take some time off to celebrate.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
But what about your work?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I'm just going out for the day, Grandma.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And I know where.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I only want to see the Moomins.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
They're still hibernating.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
No, they're not. It isn't winter anymore.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Winter or spring, I happen to know the mommens are still asleep.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
How could you know what the mommens are up to, Grandma?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Hm. Oh, which is no everything, my dear girl.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Really? Well, I'll go and see.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Come here.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.080
I have to admit that I can't help being worried about the moments. Their windows are open for the spring.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.759
So they can smell the first spring flowers.

00:12:56.759 --> 00:13:05.000
Well, I suppose I'd best be getting on. Why didn't you tell them about the witch in the spell?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Well after all that was just an idea I got.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Ideas can be embarrassing if you were wrong, so don't tell anyone for the time being.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
All right.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I'm going.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And I'm leaving too.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Okay.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:28.580
There's Alicia. And I'm leaving too. Okay.

00:13:29.879 --> 00:13:31.080
There's Alicia.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.779
Hi, everyone. It's me.

00:13:35.179 --> 00:13:37.179
Why do you get a teller? We better tell of the truth, I guess.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
The best thing would be for me to talk to her first. Yes, I agree. She's unbelievable, how kuchy!

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I can hardly believe you could be so mean, grandma! Calm down, my dear!

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Why, I did it all for you, Alicia!

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
You did it for me!

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
If the moments are asleep, why should you go there?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Do them a world of good, too, along sleep!

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
How would you do that? I'm it for me! If the moments are asleep, why should you go there?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.500
Do them a world of good, too, along sleep!

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.000
How ridiculous, grandmother!

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.500
Alicia, you've done quite well in your studies, and if you keep at it,

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.000
I see no reason why you shouldn't be a fully-fledged witch before 30.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And if I do see the moments, I won't be a witch till I'm 31, is that what you mean?

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:31.600
Now, the moments are very bad, and the l ones on you, they are so disgustingly good, and if you want to be a witch, you mustn't see them.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.000
Hmm...

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:41.000
And if I promise never to go near Moomin Valley again, will you lift the spell, Grandma?

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.080
Good girl, that's exactly what I wanted here. You promised me that, Alicia.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.279
I promise, Grandma.

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:49.559
Right. The spell should be lifted.

00:14:49.559 --> 00:14:50.679
Snuff guard.

00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:51.600
What do you want?

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.919
There are two different ways of lifting the spell I cast on the movements.

00:14:54.919 --> 00:14:55.720
Uh-huh.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.440
The first one is that I go to Moomin Valley myself

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.159
and chant the magic words outside their bedroom window.

00:15:01.159 --> 00:15:03.799
Hey, Grandma, that's not a good idea.

00:15:03.799 --> 00:15:09.440
Oh, oh, you mean people who might be upset about me casting a spell on the moments?

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.440
You may be right.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.919
So therefore, Snuff Kid, I have no choice but to ask you to perform the task.

00:15:14.919 --> 00:15:17.240
Oh, but why me?

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.960
You do have your harmonica with you?

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.960
Of course.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:25.600
Let me have it, please.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.240
Eldritch Cabalasome, Eldritch Cabalasome, Eldritch Cabalasome, Eldritch Cabalasome. Eldritch Cabalasome, Eldritch Cabalasome.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.240
Eldritch Cabalasome, Eldritch Cabalasome.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.240
Eldritch Cabalasome, Eldritch Cabalasome, Eldritch Cabalasome.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.399
If you don't stop staring at me, my witchcraft won't be effective.

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:38.919
Alicia, get me the next potion now.

00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:40.759
Oh.

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:41.679
Oh.

00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:47.000
All right, grandmother.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Eldridge Cabalazone, Eldridge Cabalazone, Eldridge Cabalazone. Oh, she can't do it if we look at her, huh?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Now, listen, Inspector, you must do something.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
You are the police, aren't you?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Well, I have to tell you, waking people up is not really part of our job.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.879
But you're our last hope inspector you must do something

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:14.240
Perhaps if you could possibly use your whistle to wake them up. Uh-huh. It's very shrill indoors good Friday

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:29.000
No, and fire your revolver. I'm sure that would do it in specter. I don't carry guns. They're dangerous. Oh, dear.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Hey, Snuffkin! Little Y!

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
He sounds worried, I bet they're still fast asleep.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Hmm.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Right, Snuffkin?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Get on with it. It's not working, is it? Get my pants, nap.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Snuck in! Snork made on!

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Wake up!

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Spring is here!

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Come on!

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.500
Ah! Hmm...

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.500
Hmm...

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.500
Ah...

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.500
Oh, spring is here already.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.000
Good morning, Papa Deer.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.500
Hmm, good morning.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.000
I have a feeling we've over-slaped.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.500
I wonder whether the others are up yet.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.000
Oh, she's made of full of those nuffkin.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
I'm shut up, Sniff.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Maybe she forgot how to cast off the spell.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Hi, Snuffkin!

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Hi!

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Good morning!

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Good morning, everybody!

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Hi, Snuffkin!

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I'm so glad you were right back already, Snuffkin.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Yes!

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
You woke up early too!

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Did you hear that?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
It's you that woke up late, Moonman!

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Who me?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Hmm?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Ah!

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Now I say, Moonman's already up about!

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
What?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.700
I snore!

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.700
Oh, it's you, you're awake!

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.700
I'm glad I didn't blow my whistle!

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.200
But we did have a reason to be worried, Inspector.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.200
He's right, what about Moom and Mama?

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.200
And Moom and Papa?

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.700
Hello there, everybody.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.700
Is anything the matter?

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.200
Nothing at all!

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.200
There are weak!

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.000
Oh, dear, I don't understand!

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
You don't understand words!

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
We were very worried because you just wouldn't wake up!

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Oh really, you do know we always have a night, don't you?

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Sleep all winter and we always wake up in this room!

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Of course, of course, but this year, start your turn!

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Right, well we did have a bit of a problem.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
You see, Moomin Papa, we couldn't swim!

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.160
Snuffkin! Back all right ass.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.359
Why don't you listen to us mimin papa?

00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:12.839
Very well. Why don't you all come in and we'll have a nice cup of tea.

00:19:12.839 --> 00:19:15.680
And we can discuss your problem properly.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.519
But it's your problem I'm afraid not ours.

00:19:18.519 --> 00:19:22.119
What does he mean? We don't have a problem doing.

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:28.059
Please do come in anyway everybody. Please. you too, all of you come in.

00:19:28.059 --> 00:19:29.660
Come in, everybody.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.980
I'm on the side. I'm in Georgia.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:48.000
Whatever happens to us this year. Hey, Snuffkin?

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Alicia!

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Oh, man! We've come to see you, Alicia.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
That was nice of you.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Your grandmother isn't home, is she?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
No. Then we can play hideous games. Come in! We've come to see you, Alicia. That was nice of you.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Your grandmother isn't home, is she?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
No.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Then we can play hide and seek.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
I can't.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
I promise Grandma there.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Yes, I know.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Snuff can tell me.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
That was a really great thing to do.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
But you didn't promise not to see us.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
You just promised not to go to Mom and Valley, didn't you?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Yeah.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.279
And listen, you never promised not to play with us either, did you?

00:20:27.279 --> 00:20:28.279
No.

00:20:28.279 --> 00:20:31.319
So if we came here to see you instead of you to us,

00:20:31.319 --> 00:20:33.960
then it's all right, and you don't have to break your promise.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.960
Oh, I suppose so.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.839
Yes, I suppose you're right.

00:20:37.839 --> 00:20:39.759
Well, let's play.

00:20:39.759 --> 00:20:40.359
Yeah.

00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:42.359
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:47.000
13, 4, 3, 5, 8.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
That afternoon they all had the most wonderful time playing hide and seek in the woods.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Hi, Jule.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Pre- your tins are my six seven. And... We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
They're always happy and goes at play

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
The Moons are having fun day after day, the Moons

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
The Moons

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000
The Moons The Moon, the Moon, the Moon.
