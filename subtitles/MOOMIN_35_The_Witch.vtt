00:00.000 --> 00:20.560

00:20.560 --> 00:32.800
me here for you on your TV they are the moments they are the moments so come with me give me your hand

00:32.800 --> 00:41.360
I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just like a bird sing the best song ever there

00:41.360 --> 00:56.800
were the moments there were the moments there were the moments

01:12.240 --> 01:27.400
these days moman and snuffkin were together even more than ever winter would

01:27.400 --> 01:34.280
hit moman valley any day now and then they would have to park moman to go into

01:34.280 --> 01:45.720
the hibernation and snuffkin to be for his trip so you look sad for something upset you

01:45.720 --> 01:50.640
where are you off to moman to the lonely mountains how come you two are always

01:50.640 --> 01:55.840
stealing off somewhere we're not stealing off we're just going for a walk to

01:55.840 --> 02:00.320
lonely mountains just the two of you you're even worse than usual never taking any

02:00.320 --> 02:07.040
of us with you I hadn't noticed are we really doing that I'm not sure maybe we are no

02:07.040 --> 02:13.280
maybe's about it let me tell you it's very rude but we were just off for a walk I know well

02:13.280 --> 02:18.160
then why are you going it'll start snowing any day now little night and then we won't be able

02:18.160 --> 02:23.440
to go anywhere will we we wanted a last look at moman valley from above before that happens a

02:23.440 --> 02:29.120
likely story but it's true I'm off very soon and I wanted to see it all to give me a picture to

02:29.120 --> 02:34.240
remember while I'm walking did you hear that snorke main sniff come here

02:38.480 --> 02:43.520
when do you mind if we come along with you of course not you see we thought you were

02:43.520 --> 02:48.640
probably plotting something secret and weren't letting any of us in on it oh come on we don't

02:48.640 --> 02:53.440
have any secrets from you it's just that well you know what I mean snuffkin will be leaving for

02:53.440 --> 02:56.720
months months very soon never mind off we go

03:05.680 --> 03:11.360
it would be fun to see it all from here in the middle of winter all white must be very beautiful

03:11.360 --> 03:16.480
oh I don't think so with everything white and clean in summer it's very beautiful

03:17.040 --> 03:22.640
well I'm coming back here in winter to see it for myself you can't do that you're hibernating

03:22.640 --> 03:28.480

03:28.480 --> 03:36.000
moman and I did last year yes you could never do it what about you are you hibernating I'm not all

04:35.360 --> 04:44.240
wait there but there are other rocks by the path you know are there but this is the only one I've

04:44.240 --> 04:49.600

04:49.600 --> 04:55.040
house is in the forest and she's coming to show me the way in the forest you mean the forest of

04:55.040 --> 05:02.240
witches yes I suppose so it's not very far from here that's it definitely how long have you been

05:02.240 --> 05:08.400

05:23.280 --> 05:28.080

05:28.080 --> 05:35.280
along the path and wanted to help very kind of you I'm sure well don't just stand there my dear

05:35.280 --> 05:45.680
let's go come along excuse me excuse me ma'am but don't you live in the forest

05:47.360 --> 05:54.800
and did I do in what part of it let me see it must be about right in the middle interesting the

05:54.800 --> 06:00.160
only place I know of is an old house where they say witches used to live you don't say I'm

06:00.160 --> 06:04.400
mad well what do you know what will he think I'm next

06:04.400 --> 06:06.400
oh

06:17.600 --> 06:25.840
her grandmother is a witch I think but surely they don't exist of course not like dragons don't exist

06:27.360 --> 06:33.760
well she doesn't seem like a nasty one how can you tell moment I don't think that nice girl would

06:33.760 --> 06:42.560
have a bad one for grandma perhaps not so tell me what makes you think she's a witch yeah who else

06:42.560 --> 06:48.000
could live in that forest papa I can't think of anyone right now but some people would like it

06:48.000 --> 06:53.600
yes I suppose you're right I hope you are well I've lived in movement valley for a long time

06:53.600 --> 06:57.280
and I'm never once seen a witch so they don't exist

07:01.520 --> 07:05.840
yeah oh stop working now snork dinner's ready I'm coming

07:11.040 --> 07:17.200
no wonder it's so light look the moon is up snork maiden I think it would be very wise for you

07:17.200 --> 07:22.880
to stay with the movements from tonight on why on earth do you think that snork I've decided not

07:22.880 --> 07:29.040
to hibernate this winter why ever not I want to complete the blueprint for my new flying ship

07:29.040 --> 07:36.880
by next spring for a real inventor sleep is an unnecessary luxury science my dear snork maiden

07:36.880 --> 07:43.280
will not wait while inventors take a nap but you know dear snork how dependent you are in your sleep

07:43.280 --> 07:48.080
I'll stay with very well then this winter I will hibernate with the movements

07:48.400 --> 07:52.080
excellent shall we have dinner I'm ready now

08:02.560 --> 08:07.360
most certainly snork snork maiden will be just fine here with us thank you

08:08.560 --> 08:13.360
this is nice for movement too now you'll have snork maiden to keep him company yes

08:14.160 --> 08:18.160
but who needs company when they're hibernating after all moment will be faster sleep

08:18.720 --> 08:24.000
never the less sleeping is much nicer when someone else sleeps in the same room when do we start

08:24.000 --> 08:30.240
hibernating do you think with weather like this in another few days again so early we'll have

08:30.240 --> 08:35.120
snow before the week is out well good luck with your new blueprint snork I look forward to seeing

08:35.120 --> 08:40.880
your flying ship in the spring hmm come this time next year I'll definitely be flying about

08:44.080 --> 08:52.000
thanks again for taking snork maiden it's not trouble at all good night then good night snork see you

08:52.000 --> 09:06.320
snork maiden good luck this winter snork thank goodness at last I can really concentrate on my work

09:13.840 --> 09:17.120
I don't believe this

09:21.760 --> 09:31.760
am I hallucinating

09:44.320 --> 09:49.920
oh a witch I'm sure it was I'm positive I'm a broomstick

09:51.200 --> 09:56.240
when the snork gets an idea in his head it's not much room for anyone or anything else is there

09:56.640 --> 10:02.000
I hope you'll succeed this time at least in my dream that rounding really flew well

10:02.000 --> 10:08.400
I often dream that I fly but I wouldn't dream of trying it out snork must have had some sort of a new idea

10:08.560 --> 10:11.360
oh it's snork

10:16.720 --> 10:20.720
what's the matter

10:27.440 --> 10:29.120
oh that's my piece of cake

10:29.280 --> 10:36.000
you look like you've seen a ghost not a ghost she left at me

10:36.480 --> 10:42.640
murdered she was flying on a broom no engine at all are you talking about the witch what's the

10:42.640 --> 10:49.920
use there's no point if you can do it so easily holding itself together you really swore yes

10:49.920 --> 11:03.200
but what right near I can't see any witch up there snork just the moon up in the sky

11:13.520 --> 11:18.560
and she was really flying in the sky is that what snork said well he should know about

11:18.640 --> 11:25.040
things that fly hmm but I just can't believe it until I've seen it myself if she really is a witch

11:25.040 --> 11:30.720
then what about the girl I mean no one could be happy living with a witch I really don't know I

11:30.720 --> 11:36.640
thought witches had to be old maybe it's not her real grandmother she could be adopted well

11:36.640 --> 11:40.560
woman we must get to the bottom of this yes enough can we must

11:49.440 --> 11:55.360
huh cop you at it again you and your secret plan where are you going today you can't come with

11:55.360 --> 12:00.720
us little fly and why not because we're going on a dangerous mission we're going to the forest of

12:00.720 --> 12:06.320
witches well if you're in any danger then I must certainly come along to look after you moon and

12:06.320 --> 12:14.880
come on besides nothing's exciting to happen to me since I went up with a kite this is so exciting

12:16.480 --> 12:21.440
sleeping only through a set of four that I must cram in one adventure first this is what we'll do

12:21.440 --> 12:25.520
I grab the witch and while she's helpless you two grab the girl and whisk her away to safety

12:25.520 --> 12:30.640
that sounds great but we don't know if she is a witch little my if we grab her and she isn't a

12:30.720 --> 12:35.760
witch it would be embarrassing and we could all be in trouble maybe the witch needed an innocent

12:35.760 --> 12:42.400
maiden to try out some potions to experiment on her maybe let's find out how do we find out by

12:42.400 --> 12:47.440
snooping around I suppose I hope you'll think of something a bit better than that before we get

12:47.440 --> 12:52.640
there let's hide as close to the houses we can and then ask the girl as soon as she comes out

12:53.360 --> 13:00.560
and what if she doesn't come out snuffkin then we'll improvise little my so this is the famous plan

13:00.560 --> 13:06.160
by the great snuffkin look if she doesn't come out of the house we'll just go up a knock on the door

13:08.800 --> 13:14.400
once we're inside I'm sure we'll be able to tell what's really what I don't think it's a very

13:14.400 --> 13:19.920
good idea what if she catches a spell on us little my will wait outside and if we don't come out she

13:19.920 --> 13:25.200
can run back to moonman valley for help that's fine but moonman can wait outside and I'll search the

13:25.200 --> 13:31.040
house oh no little my you can wait outside and I will search the house let's do it this way you stay

13:31.040 --> 13:37.280
outside and if we get caught try to free us and run for help as quickly as you can only if you can't

13:37.280 --> 13:43.280
is that okay that means if you're in trouble your lives will be in my hands that's right little

13:43.280 --> 13:48.640
my I don't like this out of this I'm not sure I want little my to be my last home while I

13:48.640 --> 13:52.800
wouldn't help anyone who doesn't trust me that's for sure you're that see what I mean

13:54.160 --> 13:57.200
be quiet there's a house

14:03.600 --> 14:10.160
look at this it's very quiet do you think there's anybody home I don't know let's wait a while and see

14:11.280 --> 14:17.440
do we have to stay absolutely still but of course we do we'll feel extremely silly if the house is

14:17.440 --> 14:23.840
empty they've disappeared they could have told us where they were going I'm sure I don't care

14:23.840 --> 14:30.400
little my went to I think she's betrayed us that's just like her don't worry I've got a pretty good

14:30.400 --> 14:36.400
idea where they were heading for you know where they've gone why didn't you tell me where are they

14:36.400 --> 14:42.000
they've gone to the forest of witches what they've gone to see whether the woman we met yesterday's

14:42.000 --> 14:49.280
a real witch a real one why don't we go there too I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find my way sniff

14:51.120 --> 15:02.160
what is it no it's my stomach I better lie down oh it's very painful oh how much longer we

15:02.160 --> 15:07.760
can have to stay here like this this adventure isn't the least bit exciting well let's wait a

15:07.760 --> 15:12.640
little bit longer be quiet at least we know the girl is definitely in there no we don't she

15:12.640 --> 15:16.880
might be out she could be anywhere I know that's possible but I don't think so

15:22.880 --> 15:29.600
she's getting some water as I thought that way she's working her to the bone hey little boy

15:29.600 --> 15:34.160
she's following that girl you go with her movement and find out as much as you possibly can about

15:34.160 --> 15:43.280
what's going on I'll watch the house right hey wait for me

16:04.160 --> 16:09.280
oh

16:34.160 --> 16:59.160
If you're looking for Alicia, she's up.

17:00.160 --> 17:04.160
Stop! Listen, wait and see.

17:04.160 --> 17:07.160
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

17:07.160 --> 17:14.160
Why did you try to run away then?

17:14.160 --> 17:16.160
Oh, I'll help you with that.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.160
So will I.

17:17.160 --> 17:21.160
How kind of you. It is a bit heavy to carry, you know.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.160
I think I remember your name. Is it Alicia?

17:24.160 --> 17:26.160
Yes, it is. I'm so glad you remembered it.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.160
My name is Lohman.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.160
And I'm Lohman.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.160
What are you doing here in the forest of witches?

17:31.160 --> 17:35.160
Well, to be perfectly honest, we came because we were rather worried about you.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.160
What about me? Why is that?

17:37.160 --> 17:40.160
Is that a woman really your grandmother?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.160
Of course.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.160
You're quite sure?

17:42.160 --> 17:46.160
Yes, of course. She's my mother's mother. Why do you ask?

17:46.160 --> 17:48.160
Well, don't you know?

17:48.160 --> 17:50.160
He's trying to ask.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.160
That's cool.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.160
Or maybe your grandmother is a witch.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.160
Yes, she is.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.160
Of course.

17:56.160 --> 17:59.160
Oh, I'm sorry. I was a bit taken aback.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.160
You don't mind about your grandmother being a real witch?

18:02.160 --> 18:03.160
Oh, no.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.160
That's what she is. I was husband.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.160
I'm going to be one, too, when I'm grown up.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.160
Oh, no. You couldn't.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.160
Well, you don't look anything like one.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.160
Well, that's because I'm not one yet.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.160
When you're born into a witch family, that's what you become.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.160
But it's not that easy, you know.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.160
Oh, this is too much.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.160
Now, tell me, what are you doing here in the forest of witches?

18:25.160 --> 18:27.160
You don't sound like a witch.

18:27.160 --> 18:30.160
Oh, really? What do witches sound like?

18:30.160 --> 18:33.160
Well, to be honest, you're the first one I've ever met in my whole life.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.160
I'm sure that's just what you think, young man.

18:36.160 --> 18:39.160
Is it true that the nice girl is really your granddaughter?

18:39.160 --> 18:42.160
Certainly. A very promising young girl.

18:42.160 --> 18:46.160
Honest and hardworking, and with a lot of training, she will make an excellent witch someday.

18:46.160 --> 18:49.160
But how can you possibly turn such a sweet girl into a witch?

18:50.160 --> 18:52.160
The sweetest girls make the best witches.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.160
Hello, didn't know you were back, Grandma.

18:54.160 --> 18:57.160
Thank you for getting the water, Alicia.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.160
Oh, who's that?

18:59.160 --> 19:03.160
I don't know. Some naive young man ought to rescue a damsel in distress now.

19:03.160 --> 19:06.160
I remember you, your snuffkin.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.160
Yes.

19:10.160 --> 19:13.160
Your friend snuffkins in here, why don't you come in, too?

19:13.160 --> 19:14.160
In the house?

19:14.160 --> 19:15.160
Really?

19:15.160 --> 19:17.160
He's brought friends with him, has he?

19:17.160 --> 19:20.160
Suffkin, whatever they're done to you.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.160
I'll take care of that.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.160
Wait a second, I'll do it for you.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.160
I'll fix it.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.160
Wait, I'm gonna need you again.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.160
Where are you going?

19:35.160 --> 19:38.160
I don't think that snake ever got bitten before.

19:38.160 --> 19:39.160
I'll get another.

19:39.160 --> 19:42.160
I'm very curious, why are you three here, huh?

19:42.160 --> 19:46.160
They came all the way from Moomin Valley because they were really worried about me, Grandma.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.160
What about you?

19:48.160 --> 19:54.160
Yes, they thought you might be nasty to me, so they came all this way to see if I needed help.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.160
This always happens.

19:56.160 --> 20:01.160
People treat witches as if they weren't ordinary, respectable, responsible citizens.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.160
No, no, we're very sorry.

20:03.160 --> 20:10.160
We realize she's quite okay and she's most welcome to visit us in Moomin Valley at any time, isn't she snuffkin?

20:10.160 --> 20:12.160
Yes, certainly.

20:12.160 --> 20:15.160
What? You said you'd visit these people?

20:15.160 --> 20:20.160
Yes, I thought I'd go over there sometimes after I finished with my homework, of course.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.160
I would never leave my studies half done.

20:22.160 --> 20:28.160
Sorry, Alicia, but if you ever want to become a good witch, you mustn't see any ordinary mortals.

20:28.160 --> 20:33.160
Oh, why not? I've only just become friends with them, Grandma, please.

20:33.160 --> 20:38.160
I know. Why don't I wait a year and study to be a witch next year?

20:38.160 --> 20:40.160
Alicia.

20:41.160 --> 20:47.160
This is family business, so if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you were to leave.

20:47.160 --> 20:51.160
And I'd like you to go immediately if you'd please.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.160
It's snowing.

21:04.160 --> 21:11.160
While she certainly won't be able to visit us at Moomin Valley is buried in snow, so we might never see her again.

21:11.160 --> 21:16.160
No, that's right, and you'll be leaving soon, won't you snuffkin?

21:16.160 --> 21:21.160
Winter had come once again to Moomin Valley.

21:21.160 --> 21:24.160
It's snowing.

21:51.160 --> 21:58.160
The Moons are having fun day after day, the Moons.

21:58.160 --> 22:01.160
The Moons.

22:01.160 --> 22:08.160
The Moons.
