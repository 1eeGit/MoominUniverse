Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're here for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:30.239
They are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:37.159
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land, you can fly

00:00:37.159 --> 00:01:47.000

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It was the wettest weather that anyone could remember. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going this? Of course, dear. And this one too?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Yes, dear, but what do you need them for?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'll give you some.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'll give you some.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I'll give you some.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'll give you some.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I'll give you some.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I'll give you some.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I'll give you some.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'll give you some.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I'll give you some. I'll give you some. You'll miss one too? Yes, dear, but what do you need them for? It's a secret.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
A secret?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Yeah, sure.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I'll want to see a back moment, but you can keep the jar, if you like.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Thanks. Oh, dear me. Oh, there are puddles everywhere. Oh, dear me, Mr. Hemmielen.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
What a mess.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Hello, Mr. Hemmielen.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Oh, dear me.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Oh, dear me.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Oh, dear me.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Oh, dear me.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Oh, dear me.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Oh, dear me.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Oh, dear me.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Oh, dear me.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Oh, dear me.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Mr. Hemmielen. What a mess dear me, Mr. Hemmielin, what a mess!

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Hello, Mr. Hemmielin!

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Oh, good morning, Momen!

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Oh, it's all misty now.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
What are you doing, Momen?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Observing very closely.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Oh, splendid, my boy. I'm glad you find botany so exciting.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Oh, what exactly is boy. I'm glad you find botany so exciting.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.599
Oh, what exactly is it you're observing?

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.000
I'm sure I saw a beautiful crayfish in there.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Crayfish?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.039
Excuse me, young man, but that is the wall

00:03:54.039 --> 00:05:01.000
of Zeequette, the most uninteresting field. There it is. Oh Oh! Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! I got him! I got him! I got him!

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I got him!

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Huh?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Oh, dragon!

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Oh, dragon.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Papa!

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Oh, what have you got there?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Oh, oh, nothing, Papa.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Everything's so fresh after the rain.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Oh, woman.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Yes, it is.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.500
I got to show this to Snuffkin before anybody else sees it.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Oh. Oh Boom moment! What do you got there, Moonman?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Oh, nothing! Nothing at all, little lion.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Oh yes, you have, I saw it! Don't lie to me!

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
It's just one of Mama's old jars!

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Liar! Liar! I know there'sar, liar, I know there's nothing.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I don't think there's nothing.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Then why are you hiding it?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Oh, right, you little mice. See me, it's not fair.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Dragon. Ah, yeah, I was right.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
It must be a baby dragon.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Probably the very last one on Earth and washed up by the rain.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
A dragon of my own.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Well, that's wonderful.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Oh, I hope I did it frighten you.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I know what frighten you.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I know what I'll do. I'll take the lid off the jar so you can get some fresh air and little dragon.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
See? That's better, isn't it? Come on, little fella. We'll give you a cut so make you be starving. I'll get you something from my nighttime emergency food box. I've got lots of things in there. Bound to be something you like.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Go on. Take anything you won. Ah! Oh!

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Oh!

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Oh!

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Oh!

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Oh!

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Oh!

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Oh!

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Oh!

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Oh!

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Oh!

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Gosh!

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
That's really clever, little dragon!

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Moving! Lunch is ready!

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Coming!

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Now you stay here.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Don't worry, I'll be back in no time at all!

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Remember, you're my own little dragon!

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Oh! Remember, you're my own little dragon. Mm-hmm.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Oh.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Oh.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Where's Sniff? I thought he was here as well.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
He's collecting worms for fishing.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
He'll be here soon.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
We'll start without him then.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
You know, Mama, certain people keep secrets and glass jars.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.100
Secrets?

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.440
Oh, yes, a little secret that hisses.

00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:15.360
Moment mama, I found this near the big puddle.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.679
Thank you, sniff. Moment, I told you I wanted it back.

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:21.759
It's my very best one.

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:23.840
Sorry mama, I was so excited.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.120
I must have left it when I found, I mean when I was was and I'm sure you know who I mean by certain people.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.519
Did you catch anything with the sieve moment?

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:36.440
Yes he did something that's now hidden in his room.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.840
Big mouth.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.600
If it's a secret little my perhaps he doesn't want to tell anyone.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.159
Yeah probably because his new pet bites.

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:46.899
Well it hasn't bitten you yet, hasn't it?

00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:49.200
Huh, if it did, I'd bite it back.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.039
Is it true?

00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:52.600
Does your secret really bite people?

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.100
Well, it couldn't bite very hard

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.279
if it was small enough to go in a jar, good at papa?

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:59.080
I suppose certain people might keep

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.600
other small things in jars, beetles and spiders,

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.720
mosquitoes, scorpions, or poisonous centipedes, horrible things that multiply

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.519
and multiply every week and grow and grow until the jars

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:10.519
are too small.

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:14.600
See, like that.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.919
And there'll be so many of them, thousands and thousands,

00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:19.879
and they'll take over moving valley and eat us all.

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:22.840
Oh, well, I haven't got a centipede.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.500
I wonder if centipedes come from out of space.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.240
But this is the Earth's deer.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.080
The rain could have brought them down from space, Mama, couldn't it?

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.320
Well, you could be right.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.879
It was raining very hard yesterday.

00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:37.679
And it wasn't like ordinary rain.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.679
I saw a puddle as big as a lake.

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:43.919
What's the matter, Moomin?

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:46.000
It isn't a centipede.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Ha, we're on the right track, though. Well, I'm glad it's not a poisonous centipede.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
I shouldn't have liked that.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Oh, you're asleep.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Moomin's little dragon.

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:10.480
Oh, you're asleep. Moments little dragon. Is it okay if I go see Snuffkin, mama?

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.080
Have you finished already?

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.919
Yes, I have.

00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:15.919
Tell them they mustn't go into my room.

00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:18.720
Or they'll have to take the consequence, sis.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.720
All right, Momen.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.720
I'll make sure no one goes in there.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.720
I promise.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.000
Oh, but he's gonna tell Snuffkin. I have to take the consequence, sis. All right, movement. I'll make sure no one goes in there.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I promise.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.500
Oh, but he's gonna tell snuck in the secret.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.000
I should think he is.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Best friends always come first, little my. Hey, Snuffkin!

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Hi!

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Fishing again?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Yep.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
The cards told me that if I caught five minnows, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
South?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
You're joking!

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Not at all.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I believe in the cards.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I'm not joking.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I'm not joking.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I'm not joking. I'm not joking. I'm not joking. I'm not joking. The cards told me that if I caught five minnows, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.500
South?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
You're joking. Not at all. I believe in the cards.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
But snuffkin, winter's not here yet.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.000
I know that, but the cards tell you things for a reason, movement.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.000
Oh, do they really?

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:25.000
But it would be awful if you and your way snuffkin, just awful. I mean, I'd be very lonely.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And anyway, who would I talk to or tell my secrets to?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Oh, snuff can quickly.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
You must come up to the moment house.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Now?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Yeah.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Well, I suppose I could fish later.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
No, no. There's no point.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
But I have to catch five minnows.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Oh.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
The fish won't bite after all his rain.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
You'd catch nothing.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It'll be better to wait until it's stopped flowing so fast.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Well, perhaps you're right.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So what's this big secret all about?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Hey, Moonman.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Have you ever seen a dragon snuffkin?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
No, of course not.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
They all disappeared off the face of the earth many hundreds of years ago.

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:08.259
But perhaps they didn't all disappear.

00:13:08.259 --> 00:13:10.860
What if there was one alive somewhere?

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.159
That's impossible.

00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:15.299
It could be so small that it would go in a glass jar, though, again.

00:13:15.299 --> 00:13:17.820
Are you sure you're not daydreaming, Moomin?

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.179
But still, anything is possible, I suppose.

00:13:20.179 --> 00:13:21.500
But you know me.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:27.000
I have to see it right in front of me before I believe it.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Oh!

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Oh, where is it? Mama promised me that she wouldn't let anyone in.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I's not here either.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Well, you were right, Moomin.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.960
Huh? here either. Well you were right movement. What?

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.759
Ah there he is. I think you found a real dragon. How do you get up there? He

00:13:54.759 --> 00:14:00.200
mustn't fall. He might lose his tail. Don't move little dragon and snuff can keep quiet.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:07.399
He might get frightened and do something silly. Don't worry, I'll soon have you down. This will do a lead on the floor here.

00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:08.759
Jump, little dragon.

00:14:08.759 --> 00:14:10.279
Don't be afraid.

00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:11.799
Come on, hold onto this.

00:14:11.799 --> 00:14:13.480
It will bring you down slowly.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.240
Don't panic.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.879
I don't think it's a very good idea, Moomin.

00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:21.240
You'll only scare him away.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.879
Why don't you just leave him alone?

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:23.919
He'll come down when he's ready.

00:14:23.919 --> 00:14:27.000
Dragons aren't helpless, you know, even little baby ones.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
But he's so small. Come to a moment.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Come on. Don't you understand?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Hold onto that and I'll listen to you.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Oh!

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Oh!

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Oh!

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Oh!

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Look at him! My dragon can fly! He's flying!

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
He's flying!

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Come down, little dragon!

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
You might crush into something!

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Come down!

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Oh!

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Oh!

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Oh!

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Oh!

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Oh!

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Oh!

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Oh!

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Be careful, Snuffkin. He might bite.

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:23.399
I don't think so. He's a very unusual pet.

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:27.000
I think he likes you more than me.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Ah!

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
What a charming little creature, Moon.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
He's lovely. What's his name? He's called Little Dragon.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.519
Ha! I don't think he's lovely at all. Small but savage, if you ask my opinion.

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:48.759
That sounds just like you, little mime.

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:50.000
You think so?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Ow!

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Yeah!

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.679
No, oh, oh, oh.

00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:57.679
Whoa!

00:15:57.679 --> 00:15:58.679
Oh!

00:15:58.679 --> 00:15:59.679
Ow!

00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:00.679
Now look here.

00:16:00.679 --> 00:16:01.679
Oh, wait.

00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:02.679
Ah.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
He seems to have a thing about ears, doesn't he?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Step Snuffkins, why doesn't he bite him?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Go on, dragon.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Go on, vitamin! He's really tasty! Go on!

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Good news, I think he's trying to heat up Snuffkins coffee.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
He must really like him.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Clevver little thing.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Well, I hope he's careful with that hot breath.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
We don't want to start a fire.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
All right, that's enough.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
He might be useful.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
When he's bigger, we can put him in the cellar

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
and he'll be able to keep the whole house just like a furnace.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
No, we will not.

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:50.759
Huh? Not Go away you pass

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.379
And you he only thought you were trying to get his fly I'll get him if he bites me again just you watch me doing

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.759
Come on little dragon.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.000
I'm sure that'll keep him quiet. That better go. Thanks for the coffee, Moomin' Mama.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:18:00.680
Oh no, it'll suffocate him! He only seems to like Snuffkin.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.200
Well we all like Snuffkin.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.599
Stupid old dragon. No, he isn't.

00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:11.000
Moomin, dear. Why don't you take him to your room?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
He'll be happier there.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.400
This will be best for him.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Oh, I wonder if he'll come back to visit us.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.400
Why did you do that?

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.200
He was cute and weak and aball is more an ear muff.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.400
You can visit him in Snuffkin's tent.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.599
I expect little dragons already sitting on his shoulder.

00:18:32.599 --> 00:18:36.000
It doesn't matter anyway. Snuffkin's going south soon.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
We'll be able to go together.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Oh, my dear, Moomin. Never mind.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Well, you're a bit of a problem.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I don't want you here, little dragon.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Go on, go away. Go to movement.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Don't do that.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Oh, come on, please go to movement.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Look, you're very nice and it'd be fun to have you along.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
But there's movement, and he'd know you were here and you'd be upset.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Oh, there's another one.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
That's the fifth? Oh, dear.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Hm? I'm sure you'll get hungry. Yeah, what do you want in return? A small favor.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
I'm sure you'll get hungry. I'm sure you'll get hungry.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Yeah, what do you want in return?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
A small favor.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I'm sure you'll get hungry.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Yeah, what do you want in return?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:53.039
A small favor.

00:19:55.839 --> 00:19:58.079
Take this as far as you can, open the lid and just leave it. What? Just leave it?

00:19:58.079 --> 00:20:02.519
Yes, in a nice quiet place, with lots and lots of flies.

00:20:02.519 --> 00:20:04.359
Flies? What's in there?

00:20:04.359 --> 00:20:05.400
A dragon. A dragon? Does's in there? A dragon.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.400
A dragon? Does it bite?

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.799
Well, it might.

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:12.000
This is a big favor. I don't even like minors.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Oh, they're not too bad if you rose them.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.500
Keep the lid on, but make sure you open it up later.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.000
So it can catch the flies.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.400
All right, as long as it doesn't try to bite me.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:36.000
Don't worry. It won't.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Hello. Hi.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Oh, oh, oh.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Where is he?

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Who is that?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.299
My dragon. He must have come here snuffkin. Oh

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.539
Really I thought he was home with you sleeping in your room

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.720
No, I let him out

00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:58.599
Well dragons are very fickle all they really care about is big fat flies. It's best to forget about a moment

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.000
Did you catch your five minnows?, you were right. The water is too fast.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Oh, really?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
So I won't go soft until winter comes.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
You'll stay here then?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Well, I'm sure it wouldn't do to go against the cards.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Now what did Moomin' my friend?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Oh, that's great!

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
You're staying stuff, kid.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Fantastic! That's really, really good!

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Ah, perhaps I shouldn't have painted the float bright red.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
It might have scared those little minors right away.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Okay, let's go.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Yeah.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
That dragon was sort of stupid.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Baby dragons are.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
They make the world's worst pets.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
They never want to settle in one place.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Yeah, you're right.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.160
It was very funny though when it bit little mice here. I think it could be a little bit more fun. They make the world's worst pets. They never want to settle in one place. Yeah, you're right.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.160
It was very funny though when it bit little mice here.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.559
I think it gave her a taste of her own medicine.

00:21:51.559 --> 00:21:53.839
LAUGHTER

00:21:53.839 --> 00:21:57.559
The woman was very happy that Snuffkin was staying in Mumen Valley

00:21:57.559 --> 00:21:59.799
and not going south until winter.

00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:06.000
And as for the dragon, well, who wants to be loved by a silly old dragon?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:13.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:28.000
They're always happy and always at play. The movements are having fun day after day.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
The movements.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
The movements.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
They love the laughter and they love the living.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
The movements.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:50.000
You're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
They're always happy and goes at play.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:10.000
The movements, the moment
