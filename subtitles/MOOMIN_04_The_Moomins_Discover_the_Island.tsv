132000	136000	And you know how hungry the sea air made you all last time we went out on a boat.
136000	138000	You'd have been glad of food then.
138000	141000	You got to rough it a bit if you want an adventure.
141000	144000	Yes, but it will be more fun with coffee and pancakes.
147000	149000	Aren't you two ready yet?
158000	160000	Hello, Mummin!
161000	163000	Hi, Snorgvagan!
174000	176000	Must you use that ladder?
176000	177000	I'm all right.
177000	180000	Mummin, you're going to hurt yourself one of these days.
180000	182000	It's good practice. It's Snorg coming with us.
182000	186000	He says he hasn't got time for sailing boats at the moment.
187000	191000	I'd much rather a real sailing boat than a paper flying ship any day.
195000	197000	Are Mumma and Papa ready yet?
197000	199000	They're packing up half the kitchen.
199000	201000	Oh, it's too full.
203000	205000	Have we got to take all that with us?
205000	209000	Mumma thinks it's better to be safe than sorry and she's usually right.
209000	212000	Tell me, Mummin, where exactly are we going?
212000	214000	We haven't decided yet.
214000	216000	That's right. Wait and see.
216000	218000	Let's see.
242000	244000	Mr. Hamulin?
245000	248000	Have you found a rare plan for your collection yet?
248000	252000	Unfortunately not. There are lots of these in Mummin Valley already.
252000	254000	Goodness, where are you taking all that?
254000	256000	We're going sailing.
256000	259000	Have exciting, charting new seas and exploring desert islands.
259000	260000	Never know.
260000	264000	If I help you load up the boat, can I please come with you?
275000	277000	Captain the bridge!
277000	280000	Man the yard arm!
280000	281000	Hankers away!
281000	283000	Sailors beware!
283000	285000	Spikes the manbrace!
285000	287000	All hands on deck!
287000	289000	Full speed ahead!
289000	292000	Hey, Sniff. Any sun in the movements?
292000	293000	Not yet.
293000	295000	It's a great day to go sailing.
295000	297000	I wonder where we're going.
297000	299000	I don't have any idea.
299000	302000	Hmm, I don't actually like sailing much.
302000	304000	Do you get sick?
304000	305000	Well, not really sick.
305000	307000	It's just that I can't swim.
307000	311000	And if it's rough, it frightens me and I panic a bit.
311000	313000	It looks like it's going to stay calm.
313000	315000	So don't worry.
317000	320000	Right, that's the lot.
320000	322000	Now all aboard.
322000	327000	Mama, little Mai, Sniffkin, Mummin, Snork Maiden,
327000	329000	and Mr. Hamulin, of course.
329000	331000	Isn't he a bit old for adventures?
331000	335000	Not at all. No, Mummin Papa has promised to find a deserted island
335000	337000	where I shall search for rare plants.
350000	353000	Come on, Sniff, hurry up!
353000	355000	There's no rum.
356000	359000	Don't be silly, Sniff. Of course there is.
361000	363000	It looks very full, almost thinking.
363000	365000	There's no way this boat could sink.
365000	367000	Now come on, get him.
371000	372000	Really?
372000	374000	I promise it'll be all right.
374000	375000	Won't it, Papa?
375000	378000	Well, if it stays like this, it will, Mummin.
379000	381000	I'll come next time.
381000	383000	Let's go, Mummin Papa.
383000	385000	He's just a scaredy cat.
387000	389000	We'll go without you then, Sniff.
389000	391000	I think that will be best.
391000	394000	Anyway, someone had better stay and look after Mummin House,
394000	396000	and it might just as well be me.
396000	398000	That's very thoughtful of you.
398000	401000	There's a pancake on the kitchen table that you can have for lunch.
401000	404000	Thank you, Mummin, Mama. Have a nice trip.
409000	411000	I wish Sniff had come.
411000	413000	He's a big softy.
414000	416000	Well, he's not very good at swimming,
416000	418000	and he doesn't eat rather a lot.
418000	419000	What?
439000	442000	This is the life, isn't it, Mama?
442000	444000	It certainly is, dear.
449000	451000	Oh, look, not a breath of wind.
451000	453000	Shall I start rowing, Papa?
453000	455000	Yes, you'd better get Sniffkin to help you.
455000	457000	Aye-aye, Captain.
459000	461000	It's hardly moving.
461000	463000	You'll have to do better than that.
463000	465000	We're doing our best.
465000	467000	You two would be useless as Gally's slaves,
467000	469000	and you'd have to do your best to help them.
469000	471000	We're doing our best.
471000	473000	You two would be useless as Gally's slaves,
473000	475000	and you'd have to do your best to help them.
476000	478000	You two would be useless as Gally's slaves.
478000	481000	It's good that we're not then, isn't it?
481000	483000	So then, what's your excuse?
483000	485000	It's not easy rowing against the tide.
485000	487000	You try it.
487000	491000	No, dear, at this rate, I should be lucky to find one rare plant.
491000	495000	Well, Mr. Hamlin, you could always try collecting some seaweed instead.
495000	497000	There's plenty of that.
497000	499000	I have heard tales that if you whistle,
499000	503000	those who perished at sea will send you a wind.
503000	506000	Land! Hoi! Look, Moomin, Papa!
509000	511000	That's too small to be any good.
515000	517000	You're right.
529000	532000	Hey, look, Papa. We're moving again.
532000	534000	The tide's turned and the winds up.
538000	540000	What a beautiful island!
540000	543000	And a perfect place to land, too.
543000	546000	Oh, I bet this place has got some rare plants.
546000	550000	Be careful when you explore. There could be wild animals there.
550000	554000	Now, if someone will go and collect some wood, I'll get a fire started.
554000	558000	I've had none of you will say no to coffee and pancakes.
558000	562000	Watch me, you land lovers. I'll go and pull the boat ashore.
576000	578000	Hmm, I suppose you're right. This will come in handy.
578000	582000	As I said, Papa, it's always better to rough it with a little bit of luxury.
582000	586000	I wonder if we're the first to set foot on the island.
588000	590000	Thank you, children.
590000	592000	Is there anything else you want us to do?
592000	594000	No, I don't think so.
594000	596000	Is it okay if I go explore the island?
596000	598000	Of course, off you go.
598000	600000	Coming, snort, Maiden.
600000	602000	I'll stay and help Moomin Mama with the cooking.
602000	605000	Mama, you said we needed firewood. Is this enough?
605000	607000	My goodness for a lot.
612000	615000	You know, I don't think anyone lives on this island.
615000	619000	I haven't seen anyone unless they're hiding in the bushes.
619000	621000	I've seen someone.
621000	623000	Oh, yeah? Who?
623000	625000	Well, they weren't very big.
625000	627000	What do you mean, this big?
627000	629000	Well, same as me.
629000	631000	What did they look like?
631000	633000	Sort of white and ghostly and not very friendly looking either, Moomin.
633000	637000	Well, you probably just thought you saw something a little, Maiden.
637000	639000	I did see them. I did too.
639000	643000	Keep your hair on. I'm not saying you didn't see anything.
645000	648000	Goodness, this is magnificent.
648000	651000	Oh, what a find.
658000	661000	And what's this?
676000	680000	Oh, well.
680000	683000	Well, well, well.
683000	687000	I've never seen such rare and beautiful plants.
688000	691000	Oh.
703000	706000	Well, what's this? Goodness, it's a perimeter.
706000	711000	Now, let's see. Rain and storm. Probably broken.
718000	721000	Oh, hello. Who are you?
721000	725000	Oh, I see. This is your perimeter, isn't it? Now, watch it.
725000	729000	Mind you don't travel on those flowers, will you?
731000	734000	Oh, no, no, no. They're coming to get me.
734000	737000	Don't go away. Don't go away.
740000	743000	I think what little my saw was a hatty fattener.
743000	745000	They're not ghosts. Are they snuffkin?
745000	749000	No, they look kind of like it, but they're really harmless enough.
749000	752000	Oh, leave me alone.
752000	754000	Oh, dear. What on earth was that?
754000	757000	It sounded like Mr. Himulet.
763000	769000	Don't get away. Oh, help me, please.
775000	778000	That's it. That's what I saw.
778000	781000	It's Mr. Himulet.
781000	784000	Help! Get me down.
784000	788000	Why are they after you, Mr. Himulet? What'd you do to them?
788000	793000	I don't know. I just tapped on this post and asked them to be careful.
793000	796000	Is that what I saw? It's Mr. Himulet.
796000	799000	Help! Get me down.
799000	802000	Why are they after you, Mr. Himulet? What'd you do to them?
802000	805000	I just tapped on this post and asked them to be careful.
805000	808000	Is that ours? They seem a bit angry to me.
808000	812000	Well, then I tapped the marrometer to check the weather and they came at me.
812000	814000	Well, I don't think it's a flower's a mad about.
814000	817000	Maybe they thought you were trying to steal the marrometer.
817000	822000	I don't want it to keep it. My goodness, I'm collecting flowers, not marrometers.
822000	824000	Well, hang on.
824000	827000	I can't hang on much longer. Hurry, please.
827000	829000	They don't look so easily frightened.
829000	831000	No, now let me think.
831000	834000	Hurry, I'm slipping.
835000	837000	I've got it, Mr. Himulet.
837000	842000	The haddifatators can't see or hear very well, but they are very sensitive.
842000	844000	We'll have to try and frighten them.
844000	847000	I suggest you shake the post as hard as you can.
847000	849000	Like this.
849000	852000	Harder. Harder, Mr. Himulet.
854000	857000	Look, they can feel the ground moving.
857000	859000	Keep going, Mr. Himulet.
861000	864000	I'm getting really tired.
864000	866000	I'm exhausted, I can't.
866000	867000	They're not going.
867000	869000	Are you sure this will work?
886000	888000	You can stop now, Mr. Himulet.
889000	891000	Mr. Himulet.
896000	898000	Hey, are you all right, Mr. Himulet?
898000	901000	What disgusting creatures.
901000	904000	I have a good mind to take their precious barometer.
904000	906000	I don't think that's such a good idea.
906000	909000	It's no good anyway, it's not working.
909000	912000	How do you know that, Mr. Himulet?
912000	914000	Look, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?
914000	918000	But according to this barometer, it should be pouring down with rain.
921000	924000	This is the way to explore real home cooking.
924000	926000	It just takes a little thought.
926000	930000	And woman papa is always prepared, aren't you dear?
930000	934000	Double zero, it can't get any lower than that.
934000	935000	What does that mean?
935000	939000	If it was working, it would mean we'd be in for a terrible storm.
940000	944000	I think the reading might be right after all, Mr. Himulet.
945000	948000	See the way the sky is darkening.
953000	955000	Look at those storm clouds.
955000	957000	We better go before it's too late.
957000	959000	But there won't be time to get home.
959000	961000	We'll be shipwreck, woman papa.
962000	964000	Surely there's still time.
964000	966000	We don't want to go back to moving valley yet.
967000	969000	We've only explored half the island.
969000	972000	Besides, you never know what we might find, Snort Maiden.
972000	975000	I wanted to get my hands on those happy fat nurse.
975000	978000	That's the last thing I wanted to do, little mind, the very last.
978000	980000	I think we ought to leave now.
980000	982000	What do you think, mama?
982000	985000	Well, you're the captain, dear. It's up to you.
985000	988000	So I am. Now, let me think.
997000	998000	Oh.
1012000	1014000	Right, we'll stay.
1014000	1015000	Oh, can we?
1015000	1018000	Yes, but we must put the tent up before it starts raining.
1018000	1019000	What tent?
1020000	1022000	Always be prepared.
1022000	1024000	That's my motto.
1024000	1027000	You're very clever to think of everything.
1027000	1033000	First, we must lower the sails and pull the boat up so that she's out of harm's way.
1049000	1050000	That should do it.
1051000	1054000	Well done, everybody.
1054000	1056000	It should be safe here.
1056000	1060000	Now hurry with the tent, the storm's nearly here.
1062000	1064000	Are you all right, Mr. Himulan?
1064000	1066000	You stay here and rest, eh?
1066000	1068000	We'll manage without you.
1068000	1070000	I am a bit tired.
1070000	1075000	You get your breath back first, but don't forget to tie the boat to that tree before you come up.
1075000	1078000	It looks bad. A real humdinger.
1078000	1080000	You can touch me.
1082000	1084000	Right, let's get that tent up.
1085000	1087000	Oh, dear, what a day.
1101000	1103000	Oh, what's this here?
1108000	1111000	Oh, yes.
1111000	1115000	Well, fancy that I've never seen one of these before.
1121000	1123000	Snuffkin?
1125000	1126000	What's happening?
1126000	1128000	It's coming really fast.
1128000	1131000	Look at the rain over the sea.
1131000	1134000	We're going to get soaked if we stay here.
1134000	1135000	Just a minute.
1135000	1137000	But we'll get wet.
1137000	1139000	I know, but it's so exciting.
1139000	1140000	Huh?
1140000	1142000	Things which you have no control over.
1142000	1145000	You can see this great big storm coming towards you,
1145000	1148000	and you can't do anything about it.
1149000	1150000	No.
1150000	1153000	You have to time it just right.
1153000	1157000	When to make a run for shelter, you mean?
1157000	1160000	I knew you'd understand.
1164000	1166000	I wonder what the Hattie Fatterners are doing.
1166000	1168000	Waiting for the thunderstorm.
1168000	1169000	Why?
1169000	1173000	Because they get energy from the electricity and the lightning.
1173000	1174000	Really?
1175000	1176000	That's it!
1176000	1177000	Come on!
1177000	1180000	I've never seen rain like this.
1180000	1183000	It'll be over soon enough, Momen.
1184000	1186000	You're dressed, Mom.
1186000	1187000	I know.
1189000	1191000	It's all right.
1191000	1192000	I know.
1192000	1193000	I know.
1193000	1194000	I know.
1194000	1195000	I know.
1195000	1196000	I know.
1196000	1197000	I know.
1197000	1198000	I know.
1198000	1199000	I know.
1199000	1200000	I know.
