There was the moments, there was the moments During his long winter sleep, Mumin had a dream. And strangely enough, he dreamt that he was sleeping.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Mummann! Mummann! Mummann!

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Huh?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Felicia! Felicia! Wow! You can fly on the broomstick now!

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
That's right! I'm a fully fledged witch now, Mummann! Alicia, wow, you can fly on the broomstick now.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
That's right, I'm a fully fledged witch now, woman.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Wait, give me a ride, Alicia. Can't do that.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Oh, don't be mean, Alicia, because someone's already riding with me.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Oops, man, it's me.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Little boy, would you mind if we went a little higher, Alicia?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Sure. Oh, wow little higher, Alicia? Sure.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Oh, wow!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Higher, Alicia!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Keep it going!

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Oh, wow!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
What?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Oh, please, listen!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Come back!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Please, give me a ride, Nick!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Hahahaha!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Oh!

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Oh!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Yeah!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.919
Wow! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.439
Oh, thank you, Moon.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.400
Well, you give me a right now. Come on, now.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.240
Oh!

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.080
Eh!

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.919
Ah!

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.000
Ah! Oh! Eh! Huh? Uh-huh!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Uh-huh!

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Uh-huh!

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Momen Valley's really beautiful from up here.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Yes, lovely!

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Whoa!

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Oh!

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Oh, at least you'd be careful.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Don't do things like that.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
What are you talking about?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.800
We're not doing anything, Momen! A little boy, it least you'd be careful. Don't do things like that. What are you talking about? We're not doing anything, movement.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.199
A little moody. It's you again.

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:11.699
No wonder the broom is shaking so much.

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.699
How do you like it? I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:17.900
Where did you get this broom from, little moody?

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.500
I've brooded from the wits.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.300
I borrowed it.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.300
For a while.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.500
That's the wits, isn't it?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.500
Looks like it.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.000
Maybe we better get out of here. You're right. Stop. You two little bees. For a while. That's the winch, isn't it? Looks like it.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Maybe we better get out of here.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
You're right.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Stop!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
You two little bees, give me back my brum at once.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
No!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Yeah.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
You have your own room.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
You winches should learn how to share.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
But there's only one who's just a spare.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I want my veil from back right now.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Finders, keepers, it's my broom.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Cut out a brum.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.039
Huh, why don't you take a closer look at it?

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.259
That's not a broom.

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:49.180
What do you mean?

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.979
This is not a broom.

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:51.979
Oh!

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:52.979
Oh!

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.979
Oh!

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:55.979
Hey!

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:56.979
Hey!

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:57.979
Hey!

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:58.979
Oh!

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:59.979
Oh!

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:00.979
Oh!

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:01.979
Oh, my!

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:02.979
Hey!

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:03.979
Moomin!

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:04.979
You alright, little my?

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:05.400
Little my isn't here, Moomin hey! Moomin! You alright, little my?

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.599
Little my isn't here, Moomin.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.000
Oh, oh, oh, I must have been dreaming.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.879
You were yelling out loud.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.120
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.919
I didn't mean to wake you up, Snorkman.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Can you see anything? Only snow. Everything's so light. Yes, the moon is up.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Oh, what an eerie light.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Yes.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Spring hasn't arrived yet, has it?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Not yet.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Everybody else is still asleep then?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Yes, most of them anyway.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Wendr with my brother still up.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Well, he did say before we started hybrinating

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
he wanted to finish his blueprints before spring if he could. Yes, most of them anyway. Wonder if my brother's still up. Well, he did say before we started hybrinating,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
he wanted to finish his blueprints before spring, if he could.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I hope he'll succeed this time.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
When he go out?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Huh?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Outside, just to see what the snow looks like.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Oh, no. I don't really feel like it.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.100
It's nice and warm here. Why don't we sleep till spring like the others?

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.100
Spring is still a long way off.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.100
Guess you're right.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:49.720
It is nice and warm in here. I'm so very hungry moment. Your mother's raspberry juice is really the best.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.040
It is, isn't it?

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.920
Everybody said that last winter too.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.920
A moment.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.920
Yeah?

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.920
I have a funny feeling.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.720
Someone is watching us and I don't like you one little bit.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.920
Moment poppig had explained it.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.920
I'm sure.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.920
Of course someone's watching.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.920
What the hell?

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.920
And how do you know?

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.000
Two-ticky told me all about it last winter snort maiden. I'm sure. Of course someone's watching. What? But who?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And how do you know?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.639
Two-ticky told me all about it last winter, Snort Maiden.

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.399
She doesn't hibernate, you know?

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:13.759
She lives in our bathhouse and watches over us in the winter.

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.000
She said that many things are too shy to show themselves.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.480
Oh, have you seen them yourself?

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.480
Sort of.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.480
Except they were invisible, of course.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.480
Like under the sink.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.000
Or in the clock, maybe. Except they were invisible, of course, like under the sink.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Or in the clock, maybe.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
In the empty fireplace and other dark corners of the room, I can feel it.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Did you actually look anywhere for them?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Oh, no. They'd be very upset. It's better not to let them know we know where they are.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I wonder what these things look like.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Some of them look very much like us, too, Tiki said.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.720
Old ancestors of ours from way back, she thinks.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.720
Some of them look like us, she said.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.120
Well, I've never seen them for myself.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.720
I wonder if there is good looking as we are.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.560
Wouldn't it be a good idea to stay up and wait for the sunrise?

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:09.699
A great idea!

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.639
Now, don't say anything to scare them, but this is one of the movement's ancestors from way back.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.500
Is him morning already?

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.540
Are you sure?

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.540
I think so.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.379
There are no clouds, so why can't we see the sun?

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:28.000
I guess maybe the sun doesn't come up at all this time of the year.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Mom and I don't like this.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.759
I don't like you one little bit.

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:34.759
You silly little girl.

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:36.759
What do you need this for?

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:39.920
Please grandma, I won't be long, I promise.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.920
What are you talking about?

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.480
Is if you could fly a broom, get back back to me at once.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.879
No, I won't give it back.

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:49.079
Now give me back that broom and don't be silly.

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:50.360
How many times from sight tell you

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.639
you can't go visiting Moomin Valley?

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.279
But it's so boring here.

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:57.079
I want some company grandma.

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:59.560
Come on, Brum, fly off.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.560
Take me to Moomin Valley.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.000
Up, up, up. Help me up grandma, please. I'm going to get a moment Valley.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Help me up grandma, please.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Alright, my girl, I'll help you up, shall I?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I don't believe it! I'm floating!

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Oh, this! How fun! This is great! Wait!

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Oh, I'm falling!

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Oh!

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Oh, hey!

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Oh, how about that of these?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I'll find the bird around here.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Oh!

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Oh, to bury things a bit, how about this?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Oh, no!

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Stop the drum, Grandma!

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Please!

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Oh!

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Come on, you wanted to ride on the brum didn't you?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
You first saw the bike?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Well, we did.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Mom, please don't!

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Hm.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
If you want to learn to fly on this brum, Alicia, you can forget all about those dreaded movements and really start studying.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
It's hard work, you know, young woman.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
You must learn to concentrate.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Hey, you up there!

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Are you making fun of me, too?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Oh, I can't go. I'm going to have to go. Are you up there? Are you making fun of me, too?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Oh, I can't climb down there. Of course you can. Even if you fall, you can't hurt yourself on this soft snow.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Don't shake the ladder, Moment! This is scary!

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Slowly does it. Take it easy and don't look down.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Maybe going out wasn't such a good idea after all.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
We can always change our minds and go back to sleep, you know.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
See, you've made it.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
It's very cool though to hear moving, but I'd rather like it.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Oh, this is the roof over the front door, isn't it?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Yes, and everything will be snowed up now to spring.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.679
Oh no, what's happened to our firewood?

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.279
What's the matter?

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:14.080
There's not much wood left in here.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.840
Someone else must be burning it.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.679
Yes, but who and for what I wonder?

00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:21.759
I can feel it.

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:23.240
We're not alone in this forest.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.000
I'm sure someone's watching us.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
All those winter creatures. No, I don't think it's them.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
The grog.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Goodness me, look how big she gets in the winter time.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Move in! I'm scared!

00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:50.000
It'll be alright. Girl, stop right there!

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.840
Don't come any closer if you please.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.279
You're much, much too cold for us, you see.

00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:59.480
You could freeze a stiff, you know.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:05.000
Is it possible that you get lonely all by yourself?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I don't think there's anything we can do to help you know, not without fur coats and earmuffs and worn gloves anyway.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:31.500
We must go! Oh.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.000
Someone's been stealing our firewood. I wonder what they're doing with it. Nothing bad. There's no doubt about that.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:58.320
Must've been several people did this. Yes!

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:01.960
We had a lot of fun here in the summer. Remember?

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.559
Well, the she is still here round the ice.

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:05.340
I hope.

00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:08.580
Too, Tiki! Too, Tiki!

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.740
There's no one here. Are you sure? Look for yourself.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.840
I know they're invisible, but I'm a schrooom I sin here.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.919
Hard to tell. With things you can't see.

00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:25.500
Oh! What is it?

00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:28.500
It felt like something scampering on my back.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.200
That's all right. It must be one of the shrewel mice.

00:12:35.799 --> 00:12:37.799
Moman! Moman!

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.100
Oh, where could he have gone?

00:12:43.899 --> 00:12:48.000
My goodness! I've never seen anything quite like this before!

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Hi, it's good to see you!

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
You're right! She's fishing!

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Hi, Tukki! Hello, Tukki!

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
So this winner's not made in woke up too, huh?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I walk her up by mistake!

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
You know that spring is still a long way off, don't you?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.360
I thought it must be seeing there's no sun at all.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.000
But the sun is gonna come back tomorrow, Momen.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Tomorrow?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.600
It's Nord made me was so worried about the sun not showing.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.919
The sun will rise tomorrow, Momen, but it'll go down very soon.

00:13:17.919 --> 00:13:22.000
To take you know, I think there must be records in Moonwind Valley.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Records in Winter?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.440
There's an enormous pile of firewood up on the hillside.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.600
Oh, I know.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.120
It took a long time to collect that wood.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.840
But some of it belongs to us.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.440
That doesn't really surprise me, though, Momen.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.039
I'm afraid the winner creatures unfree careful about ownership.

00:13:39.039 --> 00:13:39.919
They need a lot.

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:41.879
So if they see it, they take it.

00:13:41.879 --> 00:13:43.919
It's for their big winner, Bonfire.

00:13:43.919 --> 00:13:45.200
A bonfire?

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.299
Yes, and now your firewood can take part in the big celebration.

00:13:49.299 --> 00:13:53.100
They light it every window to make sure the sun comes back, you know.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.100
Oh, you mean otherwise the sun wouldn't come back to a ticket?

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:02.100
Well, since they always light it on this day, you don't really know, do you?

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.299
Tonight you might see the winner creatures.

00:14:04.299 --> 00:14:07.000
Okay, we come along as well, too, Tiki.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Yes, you can, if you sit quietly and don't scare them in any way.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Wonderful, you're coming along too, aren't you?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Of course!

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Stop! Help me!

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Someone shouting for help?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Who could it be?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Oh, wait! Get away from me!

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I didn't do it on purpose!

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I didn't mean any harm.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
If you don't leave me alone, Grandma will turn you into a towed.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.720
Oh, it's so cold!

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.240
Go away, please!

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.240
Ah!

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.240
Ah!

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.240
Ah!

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.240
Ah!

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.240
Oh!

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.240
Grow! Leave her alone!

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.480
What are you doing, Grog?

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.000
No, man her alone! What are you doing, Grog?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
No, man! Alicia!

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Now listen, Grog.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Why can't you be nice to her?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Alicia is one of my friends.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
She was just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I nearly bumped into her, but I didn't touch her.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
That's all right, Alicia.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Tell me, Grog, what's gotten into you?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Why are you so nasty to such a sweet little girl?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
It isn't like you at all.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
I must have startled her, I guess.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And I did apologize and all, but it made no difference.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
This is really very odd.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Then I asked if she had seen you,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and that's when she started to get mad at me.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
But she doesn't even know me.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
It's a mystery.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.679
Whatever's the matter with you, Groke.

00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:41.519
Oh, I was so scared.

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:43.919
I'm so glad you've come to see us.

00:15:43.919 --> 00:15:45.480
So am I, women. Somehow I felt certain you so glad you've come to see us. So am I, Moments.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.120
Somehow I felt certain you hadn't gone into hibernation yet.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.720
But what did your grandmother say?

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.559
Nothing because I didn't tell her I was coming.

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:57.159
Thank you for chasing off that terrible monster.

00:15:57.159 --> 00:16:00.000
The Grog hasn't actually ever attacked anyone.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.480
Well, maybe she doesn't like the look of Alicia.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.399
Snork maiden.

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:07.960
It's really a mystery to me why the gropes here at all.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.639
She was here looking for a moment no doubt.

00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:11.480
Was she?

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.840
He suddenly become very popular.

00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:16.840
Huh? You don't mean...

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:25.000
Ha! What? What? What? What? What?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
What?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
What?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
What?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
What?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
What?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
What?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
What?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
What?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
What?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
What?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
What?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
What?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
What?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
What?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
What?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
What?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
What?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
What?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
What?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
What? What? What? What? What? not serious, it's out of the question. It's her ridiculous idea, don't be so silly.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.480
Where's all that drumming noise coming from?

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.279
From the invisible shroom ice.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.359
How long before everybody arrives?

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:14.319
Oh, they're here already, Moomin, all around us.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:15.319
They are?

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:16.319
Where?

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.319
I can't see them.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.799
Are they really invisible?

00:17:19.799 --> 00:17:24.559
I can't see them either, but I can feel their presence all around me.

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:27.119
But she's been studying witchcraft, hasn't she?

00:17:28.140 --> 00:18:05.000
I'm sure you and Moomin will be able to feel their presence quite soon. Oh Oh! I can see some of them looking all over there! Oh!

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Oh!

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Oh!

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Oh!

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Oh!

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Oh!

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Oh!

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Oh!

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Oh!

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Oh!

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Oh!

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Oh!

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Oh!

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
I can see some of them looking all over there!

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Oh!

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Oh!

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Oh!

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I can't see them too, you guys.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Do you think you can tell me if I can't see all of them?

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Well, we can never see them all.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
I don't understand how did you know earlier on the Shroom Lice were playing the drums.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.220
I just know because they sometimes play the drums. We see all of them. Well, we can never see them all. I don't understand how did you know earlier on the

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:51.220
Shroom Bites were playing the drums. I just know because they sometimes play them in the batch house as well.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.420
What a wonderful celebration! Isn't it lucky I came over here?

00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:07.000
If I had not have missed a most memorable evening. What's going on here?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
The grog.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
What?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
What's she going on here?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
She must be looking for a movement again, I guess.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000
No, I guess.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
No, I think she just wants to warm herself by the fire.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:47.000
What's she doing?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Well, that's the end of the mid-winter bonfire.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Pull Grog she freezes everything she touches.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.200
Whatever she sits on, even the hottest bonfire, turns freezing cold in a matter of seconds.

00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:12.299
Well, at least she's managed to save some of our wood.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.500
Go! Hold on tight, now Snorkemaid, and I'm be careful!

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
I can't wait to get into bed. I wanted to stay up until the sun came up again.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
But I don't know if I could keep awake till then.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
They're always happy and goes at play

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
The moments are having fun day after day, the movements

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:07.000
The movements, the movements The Moons
