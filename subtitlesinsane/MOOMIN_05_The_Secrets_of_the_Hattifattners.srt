1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:30,239
They are the movements, there are the movements,

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:37,640
so come with me give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:01:47,000
like a bird, sing the bass song ever, there were a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la- Bapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapap I think that rope is getting loose. Okay, Moonman, you'd better have a look before this wind has the whole tent down.

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I, I, Captain.

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
A sudden storm has hit the happy fatness I've had.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Papa, I think that rope is getting loose.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay, Moonman, you'd better have a look before this wind has the whole tent down.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,400
I, I, Captain.

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,400
A sudden storm has hit the havy fad in this island.

15
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,199
Mumen Papa has decided that it would be far safer to stay the night on the island,

16
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,360
so they put up the tent and moored the boat. This will show us what the weather's up to.

17
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,319
That's as long as it's still working.

18
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,599
I'm sure it's going to die down really soon.

19
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,520
I wake up, Mr. Hemmler.

20
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,699
When the storm clears, we must give this barometer

21
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,879
straight back to the haddy fatness.

22
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,680
Oh, I quite fancy keeping it myself to remind me of the island.

23
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,280
You know, it seems to work after all.

24
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,719
But Mr. Hemelon, that'll only remind you

25
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,680
of the horrible haddy fatness.

26
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,199
What about all the tons of plants you've found?

27
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,000
That surely is going to be enough?

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes, I know, but there was only really one special flower amongst all those plants,

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and I nearly missed that one.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Look, he's in a beauty.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I discovered it as I was about to tie up the boat.

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, woman, Papa.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes, Mr. Hermann.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,439
You know when you all went to put up the tent, you told me to tie up the boat so she was safe.

35
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes, of course.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,800
Well, I'm not sure if I did.

37
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,159
Not sure at all.

38
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,840
Please try to remember, Mr. Hemelin.

39
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,719
I can't. It's all very unclear in my mind.

40
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,939
If the boat's not here, we'll be stuck on the island forever and ever.

41
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:50,240
Well, we pulled it well ashore so it should be okay,

42
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,280
but we'd better check on it as soon as we can.

43
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
I'll go have a look.

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,439
Quickly, Moment. Be careful.

45
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,840
I remember I was just going to do it when I spotted this flower.

46
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,439
Just by a rocket was, oh dear.

47
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,759
Mumin.

48
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,399
Boy, that was close.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Tied to the tree and make sure it's tight. That should do it.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Just in time.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You know the waves must have been huge to reach this far.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, we saved the boat.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Well, this storm will be over soon.

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is everything okay? Yep, everything's fine.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh, thank goodness! So we're not stranded after all.

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Huh? No.

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We needn't have worried.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm very sorry, really I am.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Are you alright, Snort Maiden?

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Now I am. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm going to get you.

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm going to get you.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm going to get you.

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm going to get you.

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm going to get you.

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm going to get you.

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm going to get you.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm going to get you.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm going to get you.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm going to get you. I settle down for the night. But it's much too dark to see anything.

72
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,199
The fresh air will do me good.

73
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:56,699
Oh, that's a good idea. I could do with some fresh air myself.

74
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Wait for me. I'll come too.

75
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Let me and Crick are the money!

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,439
There's still there hundreds of them all glowing!

77
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,959
The hadifatners.

78
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,519
They're waiting for us.

79
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,040
The lightning must have recharged them.

80
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,279
Look at them all.

81
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,000
I wonder what they're once snuck in.

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Such a heavy storm would have given them lots and lots of energy. Gosh, they're ready for anything.

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They're not coming any closer.

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They seem fairly friendly. Maybe they just want to see what we look like.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No, I know what they're here for. Well, what's that Snuffkin?

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's their barometer, Moomin Papa. They know we've got it and they've come to get it back from us.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes, I think you're right snuffkin. Mr. Hamilton, I do think you'd better give it back to them.

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,759
Do I have to? Yes of course. After all it is there, isn't there a lot of them?

89
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,600
Look, why don't you take it out to them now?

90
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:18,519
You know the Burrometer does belong to the Mr. Hamilton.

91
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,519
Oh, dear, dear. Give it to me.

92
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:24,959
Let me do it, Papa.

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Well done, my boy.

94
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You must be careful, my dear.

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't worry, Mama.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:08:03,839
A boy isn't he brave. I think this is what you come for.

97
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,839
Here you are.

98
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,000
You can have it back now.

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Come on! I'm not going to be able to get out of here. I'm not going to be able to get out of here. I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

101
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

103
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

106
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

108
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here. I'm not going to be able to get out of here. They didn't hurt you, did they? Ah! Go away!

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Lover alone!

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Are you alright, Snorgmaiden?

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What did he do to you?

113
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Just a bit of shock, that's all.

114
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What's that funny smell?

115
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Oh my god, it's your hair!

116
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What?

117
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,039
What do you mean?

118
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,840
What's happened to it?

119
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,759
Oh, no, my hair.

120
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,600
Mama, mama.

121
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,799
Where's your mirror?

122
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,679
Oh, mama.

123
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,799
Oh, look at what those wicked, haddy fat nurse have done.

124
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,159
It's here in my handbag somewhere.

125
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,360
Hurry, mama.

126
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,639
I must see what's happened to my hair.

127
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,000
Here you are, dear. Look at me. Hurry, mama. I must see what's happened to my hair. Here you are, dear.

128
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,759
Look at me.

129
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,759
Look at me.

130
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,759
It's awful.

131
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,759
It's horrible.

132
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,759
It's horrible.

133
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,759
Don't worry.

134
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,759
We'll put some magic ointment on and it'll come back all lovely and curly.

135
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,559
I don't want nasty curly hair.

136
00:09:41,559 --> 00:10:07,000
I want my long, beautiful hair like it was before. Good, I hope that's the last we see of them. Oh dear, what's happened to Snort Maiden?

137
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:26,000
My ear, my ear, where's my ear? I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it.

138
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

139
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

141
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

142
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

144
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

145
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

146
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

147
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you.

148
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm going to get you.

149
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm going to get you.

150
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm going to get you.

151
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm going to get you.

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm going to get you.

153
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm going to get you.

154
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm going to get you.

155
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm going to get you.

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm going to get you.

157
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm going to get you. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

160
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

161
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

162
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

166
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

167
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm going to go to the next room. We've got to hurry. My wonder where they're going. Perhaps a saving away to a secret island.

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,960
Somewhere very far away from here where they can live happily on their own together.

169
00:11:52,960 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm not sure if I can find a way to find a way to find a way to find a way to find a way Where are they going? Perhaps they're sailing away to a secret island. Something very far away from here where they can live happily on their own together.

170
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,399
Gosh, enough kids, they're really weird.

171
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,799
Well, it depends on how you look at a woman.

172
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:32,500
They probably think we're a bit strange too.

173
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,779
Snuffkin, you're really horrible. You knew I wanted to see them.

174
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,120
Come on, you were fast asleep.

175
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,340
Snoring your head off.

176
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,600
That wasn't me snoring.

177
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,639
That was Mr. Him you lnd.

178
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,519
All right.

179
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,759
If you say so.

180
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:49,600
Well, I hope that's the last I'll see of them.

181
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,240
Me too.

182
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,960
That's a very pretty scarf, Snort Maiden.

183
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,720
Yes, it is, isn't it?

184
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,440
Can we go exploring, Mama?

185
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,440
I don't see why not.

186
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,639
It looks as though it'll be a nice day,

187
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,960
and there'll be lots of exciting things

188
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,500
washed up by the storm. Oh, it'll be a nice day, and there'll be lots of exciting things washed up by the storm.

189
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh, that'll be fun.

190
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's look for the other side of the island.

191
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What a good idea! I might discover some more plants! Mr. Hamillin, hurry up, sir, or it will be dark before we get there.

192
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Ah, you go on, Momen. I just want to have a better look at these flowers.

193
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes, alright.

194
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Very interesting.

195
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Just think. We could find all sorts of things lying on the sand. I hope in secret, sunken treasure.

196
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Well, let's hope it's not sunken anymore.

197
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I expect there'll be lots and lots of treasures from shipwrecks and things like that.

198
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But I find it before you!

199
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, no, you won't!

200
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Look at all this! It's all mine!

201
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm gonna die real quick!

202
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Man, what's that over there?

203
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's quite shallow right here.

204
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Well there must be something you've minute.

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, dear, it's empty.

206
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I think I found something here.

207
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Ugh!

208
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Little lie, little lie.

209
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What's the matter?

210
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Come and see these beautiful shells I have!

211
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm too busy hunting for treasuren to bother with shells!

212
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Hey, what's this?

213
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, look at this one! I've got a real collection here.

214
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Golly, lovely, and Mama's garden.

215
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Wow, watch that.

216
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What? I can't find any as nice as yours.

217
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,600
Don't be in such an awful hurry, little my.

218
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,100
Snark maiden!

219
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,100
Snark maiden!

220
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Look!

221
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
Look what I found!

222
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
A proper treasure!

223
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Look!

224
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Oh!

225
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,100
There's snow inside of it!

226
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:50,559
I found it in a cave! What is it? What's this? It's a ship.

227
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:56,679
Tell us, go. You can see for miles with it. I'll give it to Papa. It's better than

228
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:05,700
anything I got. Hey everybody, I found something. Come on up and have a look.

229
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,200
I wish I could find something interesting.

230
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Have you found some buried treasure?

231
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,200
What a big lady. Is she dead?

232
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,000
It's made of wood snork maiden. It's a figurehead from a ship.

233
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
She's like a queen!

234
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,320
Ha! She hasn't got any legs though

235
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,960
Why don't we put her on the front of our boat?

236
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,879
Nah, it's much too heavy. It must have come from a ship that was wrecked

237
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,919
And sank and see

238
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
perhaps it did

239
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,880
And all hands were lost. I want to take it home

240
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What would you do with it?

241
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Use it to frighten people away.

242
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Help! Somebody help me please!

243
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
That's old Mr. Hamlin!

244
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Gosh, I hope it's not more haddy fadders.

245
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Someone help please!

246
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,380
We're coming!

247
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:38,440
Woman, why do you like this old figurehead so much?

248
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,400
You're staring at her.

249
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,680
She's not all that special, you know?

250
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,279
Yes, I know.

251
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:47,000
She's not even real. Only made of wood.

252
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Do you like her eyes?

253
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Or is it her hair?

254
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Just because I haven't got any?

255
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Nearly there just a bit further.

256
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Come on, snuff it for me.

257
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Pull harder, come on.

258
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You're very heavy, Mr. Hemmulin. Oh, thank you, snuff getting safe my life.

259
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh!

260
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Boy, how'd you end up there, Mr. Hemmulin?

261
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
One minute I was looking for plants the next I'd fall and right into that hole.

262
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,099
I think you'd be safe for collecting stamps, Mr. Hemulin.

263
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:30,400
Oh no, it's not here. Where is it?

264
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Oh, oh, oh.

265
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
What is it now?

266
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Tell me.

267
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,599
Uh-huh.

268
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,299
May the mubulp preserve me.

269
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:40,200
Calm down, Mr. Hemulin.

270
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,000
Tell me what's the matter?

271
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,099
My sample box, my sample box.

272
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:45,599
Oh my goodness!

273
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,000
You didn't leave it in the hole, did you?

274
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,200
Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you! Oh dear!

275
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,400
All my precious samples, I'm so silly! Oh, Snuffkin!

276
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
Oh...

277
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,799
Oh, Snuffkin, would you mind?

278
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,400
Okay, anything for some peace.

279
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,900
Oh dear boy, you are wonderful.

280
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,599
You shall have one of my rarest plants as a reward.

281
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,599
And indeed you shall, I shall choose a magnificent one for you.

282
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,500
Thank you very much, Mr. Hamelon.

283
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Gosh, your one-room movement is...

284
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Oh, there you are. What have you been up to?

285
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,799
He can't take his eyes off that silly wooden lady. He just dares at her.

286
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,799
Really?

287
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:34,000
I do not. I just think she has a very beautiful face.

288
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,299
Well, Moomin, now that you're here, I could really do with your help.

289
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,299
What do you want, Snuffkin?

290
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:44,299
Mr. Hemmillen dropped his box of samples down this hole and I'm going to try and get it.

291
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:48,700
I didn't drop it. I fell in the hole and just forgot it when stuff can pull me out.

292
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,700
You're a bit absent-minded, Mr. Hemmulin.

293
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,200
No, I'm not. I can remember every Latin name of every single plant, you know.

294
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Okay, I'll go down, Moomin, but you'll have to help me get back up.

295
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Okay.

296
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,000
I'll help you too. Now be careful.

297
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,720
Can you see it yet, Snuffkin?

298
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,839
I'm not down at the bottom yet.

299
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:09,839
Oh, forgive me.

300
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,079
I'm sorry.

301
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,799
I found it.

302
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,799
Wonderful.

303
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:14,799
Tell me.

304
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,839
Are the plants all right?

305
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:19,839
You can check them yourself in a minute.

306
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,839
Oh.

307
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:27,000
Are you all right, Snuffkin? Wait a minute. I found something else.

308
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Oh, look! There's the boat! It's moment, moment, moment, Papa!

309
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Hello!

310
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's gold!

311
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Hello! We've been hunting treasure! Go and get Moomin' Pop-I-Found Gold!

312
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Boy, oh boy, I wonder how much there is.

313
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Moomin' Pop-I-Wall-No?

314
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Well, I'm not going to get a little bit of a reward.

315
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm not going to get a little bit of a reward.

316
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm not going to get a little bit of a reward. Well, loom and papa, what should we do with all this beautiful gold?

317
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It would look lovely in the garden, don't you think?

318
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
With all the shells that the snorkemaiden found,

319
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
they look good in amongst the roses.

320
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What do you think, Mama?

321
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm sure they will, Papa. I'm sure they will.

322
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Moomin, she's only a stupid, legless doll.

323
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You can have my bowl full of snorkemaiden.

324
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
No, thanks.

325
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Will I look after it for you?
