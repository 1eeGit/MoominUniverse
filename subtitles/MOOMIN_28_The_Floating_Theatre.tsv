1121180	1123380	it reminds me of NASA, but it reminds me of, it reminds me of...
1123380	1124900	but it reminds me of a brainwarming scene in the sensual house
1124900	1126700	and it reminds me of a brain of a brainwarming scene in the sensual house
1126700	1128360	and it reminds me of a brainwarming scene
1129400	1130500	and it reminds me of a brain nerd
1130500	1131740	and it reminds me of a brainrü 떨어�ives
1131740	1132900	And it reminds you of a Mary projections
1134420	1136500	I remember this
1136500	1138080	when I first saw...
1138080	1139100	a cat who threw her shoes
1139100	1140700	under my shoes
1140700	1142700	and it reminds me of a brain [(Shortcutting their shoes by himself-)]
1143140	1144260	and it reminds me of...?
1144260	1144940	I remember Gabriel Peng and his brother
1144940	1146040	when I first saw him
1146040	1147320	when I first saw him
1147320	1148900	when I first saw him
1148900	1152900	That looks safe. We could easily spend the night here.
1152900	1158900	We'd better tie the theatre to the tree so it won't drift away if that's all right with Emma.
1158900	1162900	Emma, is it all right to tie the theatre to the tree?
1162900	1166900	Do what you want, as long as you don't damage the theatre to here.
1166900	1168900	All right.
1168900	1173900	Don't whistle you idiot. Don't ever whistle in a theatre.
1173900	1177900	That's the worst luck possible. How dare you?
1177900	1179900	Oh.
1191900	1195900	This is great snork maiden. We can look at the moon.
1195900	1199900	And the flowers, they smell so good.
1199900	1201900	What's the matter?
1201900	1203900	I hope that snorks all right?
1203900	1208900	Don't you worry. He was standing guard over a flying ship after all.
1208900	1213900	All you have to do is get on board and fly away.
1234900	1238900	What's going on here?
1238900	1241900	Huh?
1241900	1249900	No, they're trying to destroy the pamphor's box. I've never seen anything like it.
1249900	1253900	These people are bunch of vandals.
1263900	1283900	Meanwhile, movement and snork maiden are fast asleep, blissfully unaware of what was happening.
1283900	1287900	But whatever they do, stranded on the treetop.
1287900	1297900	They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.
1297900	1305900	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1305900	1309900	They're always happy and goes at play.
1309900	1316900	The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.
1316900	1326900	The movements. The movements.
