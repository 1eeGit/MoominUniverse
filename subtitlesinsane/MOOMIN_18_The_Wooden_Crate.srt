Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come. Come on and sit down here with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird,

4
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Mumen Valley had had no rain for weeks, and finally the river had dried up.

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Papa says this weather is a catastrophe, Snuffman.

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, not really.

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But it is. He says Mumen Valley will turn into a desert if it carries on.

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,120
I don't think that will happen, Mum.

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,280
Papa can't ever remember it so hot.

10
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,000
Even the river is dried up.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,400
No, that does worry me.

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,039
I can't fish anymore.

13
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:20,439
And all my travels I found that droughts like this are always followed by a real heavy downpour.

14
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:35,000
Well, it's too hot for me anyway.

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, it's so hot I can't think.

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I can always think of something. Well, well, even the weeds are wilting.

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The sea never dries up, does it? Of course not, stupid wherever the fish go! I'm going swimming! Here you are. What's this? Oh, no! Oh, no!

18
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, no!

19
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh, no!

20
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh, no!

21
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh, no!

22
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh, no!

23
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, no!

24
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, no!

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh, no!

26
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, no!

27
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, no! Oh, no! I'm going to go to the next one. Ah! Ah! Ah!

28
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Ah!

29
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Ah!

30
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Ah!

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ah!

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Ah!

33
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Ah!

34
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ah!

35
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Ah!

36
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Ah!

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Ah! Ah! Oh, that hurt.

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What's this stupid box doing here?

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I think it's floated from foreign lands.

40
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What's it got in it?

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Perhaps it's full of priceless jewels.

42
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, it wouldn't float so high in the water if it was.

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
A tiara packed in wood shavings.

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,639
I could use a new product. I'm going to use it for a new one. in it. Perhaps it's full of priceless jewels. No, it wouldn't float so high in the water if it was.

45
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,720
A tiara packed in wood shavings. I could use a new comb too.

46
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,240
What have you found you two? A treasure?

47
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,560
No, we don't think so. It's not heavy enough.

48
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,399
But you never know, Snork Maiden.

49
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,639
Let's open it and see.

50
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:29,000
Come on, Slay's pushed me a shore.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Perhaps it's gold nuggets in here. Our diamonds are something to eat.

52
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What is this?

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Seeds, maybe.

54
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What sort of seeds?

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hmm.

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, at first glance, I'd say they might be tropical plants.

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, really? Mr. Hemmier.

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What plants are tropical?

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, species like banana are mangoes.

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,199
Banana? And mangoes? Well, I like banana are mangoes. Banana?

61
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,560
And mangoes?

62
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,439
Well, I haven't done a lot of research on tropical plants

63
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,839
so I can't be sure, but they do look like it.

64
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,839
I know, mama.

65
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,480
Why don't we plant them?

66
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,040
Good idea, woman.

67
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,839
The thing is, we don't have a tropical climate.

68
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,120
I'm afraid they wouldn't grow here at all.

69
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,839
Let's plant them, shall we?

70
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,540
They won't bear any fruit, so don't get too excited.

71
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,939
Oh, well, it seems tropical enough to me, Mr. Hanuman.

72
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:33,040
At least we can try, can't we?

73
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,180
I want to see what papaya looks like and ugly fruit.

74
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,420
I want mangoes growing all around my bedroom window.

75
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,720
Let's plant them, shall we?

76
00:06:43,519 --> 00:07:13,439
I tell you, they're strictly tropical tropical they won't take root at all. It certainly seems that Mama is enjoying herself, Mr. Hamulun.

77
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,439
I don't think it'll be much use.

78
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,240
Well, perhaps not, but it's still worth the fun and trying.

79
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,920
Imagine, Mum and Valley, a tropical jungle.

80
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,519
Huh, huh.

81
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,000
Oh, Mr. Hamulun, do you think these seeds will grow into real fruit trees? Imagine moving valley, a tropical jungle. Huh. Huh.

82
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, Mr. Hamulin, do you think these seeds

83
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
will grow into real fruit trees?

84
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hmm, let me see.

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What have you got here, little my?

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I could very well be mistaken,

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
but I think this one is a mango seed.

88
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hmm, thanks.

89
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And why do you want to know, little my?

90
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,500
Because I'm only growing fruit.

91
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,500
I want to be sure I'm not planning stupid orchids

92
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
or passion flowers or something.

93
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Ha ha ha!

94
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Mr. Hemiellin, can you tell me which one of these is banana?

95
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Yeah, I'm not really too sure, but I think it's this one.

96
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,199
You want to grow an orchid too, Snorkmaiden?

97
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,959
No, I just want to plant a banana tree in a really special place.

98
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,639
It's Mouin's favorite fruit.

99
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,279
I think she'll be disappointed bananas won't grow here.

100
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,279
This weather doesn't belong here either.

101
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,240
If it gets any hotter, I'll melt.

102
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,920
I can't wait for dusk so it'll cool down a bit.

103
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Hmm.

104
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,080
Isn't it wonderful to go to sleep looking at the stars?

105
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,159
And it's not so hot anymore.

106
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll sleep like a log tonight.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You always do, don't you, Little Maw?

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, sleep like an extra heavy log, then.

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Snorke, Maiden. Why don't you sleep under that tree with moon men and Little Maw?

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,080
Oh, because I can't see the stars from there and it makes me feel romantic looking at them.

111
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,000
But you're going to get very wet if it starts raining in the night.

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,519
You're joking, surely, Mama.

113
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,519
Not at all.

114
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,360
But it hasn't rained for ages, and there aren't any clouds or anything.

115
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
Just stars.

116
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,559
All the toothpicks fell on the floor, and that's a sure sign of rain.

117
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,000
It's not made in real mind if she gets all wet, Lumen Mama. Just stars! All the toothpicks fell on the floor, and that's a sure sign of rain.

118
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,600
It's not made in my mind if she gets all wet, Lumen mama.

119
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
That should be happy!

120
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,000
Who? Why is that?

121
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,600
Because then she'll know that the special tree will start growing, and that's very important to her.

122
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
That's true.

123
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:48,000
Good night, everyone. I hope you sleep well.

124
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, oh, oh. Good night, everybody.

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Good night, woman.

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Good night. Don't snore.

127
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, it's too hot to sleep. Why don't you sleep outside like the children?

128
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I think I will.

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll be back.

130
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll be back. Oh, it's too hot to sleep.

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why don't you sleep outside like the children?

132
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think I will.

133
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
A thunderstorm.

134
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I told you the toothpicks are never wrong.

135
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh!

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hey, it's raining, movement!

137
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Wake up, movement!

138
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, is it morning?

139
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The sun's really bright.

140
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No, it's raining.

141
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Rainy?

142
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Look at that.

143
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You look, I'm getting wet, I'm going inside.

144
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So mama was right about the rain.

145
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Hey, snork, Maiden!

146
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Hmm?

147
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Doesn't she look sweet?

148
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Snork, Maiden!

149
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Is it raining?

150
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,399
That's very clever. Your mother knows everything doesn't she?

151
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,200
She does.

152
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,799
Now let's get into the house.

153
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,799
Not yet.

154
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,000
I want to feel the rain on my face.

155
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,600
It's been so long.

156
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,299
Ha!

157
00:11:39,299 --> 00:12:36,000
You want to feel it much longer? It's going to go. Oh, it's the breathing.

158
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Huh? Oh.

159
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Mangoes! That's impossible!

160
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Gosh!

161
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
By my tail, a jungle! That's a tropical jungle!

162
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Wake up! Wake up you two! There's a jungle outside! We've planted a jungle!

163
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
A jungle?

164
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,700
You're right, Moments! Those seeds have not only sprouted. I know. They're big trees.

165
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,000
I've never known trees to grow like that.

166
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,299
That's... that's...

167
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:31,299
I think I'll go and play Tarzan.

168
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I wish my lettuce seeds would do that, Moments Papa.

169
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,500
Oh, there's magic here somewhere, Moments. Let's go and explore.

170
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's rain drumming on the campus.

171
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It must be.

172
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Snuffkin!

173
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What a nurse all this?

174
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,879
Well, we found a crate of tropical seeds and planted them last night.

175
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,639
And this morning, while you can see it's like magic.

176
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,120
It's fantastic.

177
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,799
I know. We can go on a safari.

178
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,840
I've seen nothing like it.

179
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,320
What kind of flower is this?

180
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,639
It looks like an orchid to me.

181
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,919
This is a real tropical jungle isn't it, Snuffkin?

182
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:30,919
Not quite.

183
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,919
What do you mean?

184
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,320
Well, Moomin, a real jungle would have wild animals in it, wouldn't it?

185
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,240
Oh yeah, like tigers and snakes.

186
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:51,000
This is more of a tropical botanical garden I suppose.

187
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's a woman's little mind. He can have the peel.

188
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This is a life.

189
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Stop, little mind.

190
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Now where? Stop, little mind! Well, well...

191
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What are you looking for, dear? My solar toady.

192
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You what?

193
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
My son helmet, I can't go into the jungle without it.

194
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I didn't know you had one.

195
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I used it for a fancy dress party once, I know.

196
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I put it in a box somewhere.

197
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Oh, here it is.

198
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Very dashing, dear. I thought so too. once, I know I put it in a box somewhere. Oh, here it is.

199
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Very dashing deer.

200
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I thought so too.

201
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, I know.

202
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Oh!

203
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh!

204
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh!

205
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh!

206
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh!

207
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh!

208
00:15:44,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh! Oh! Oh, splendid protection this hat. to get into the cello. What for? To get my gun.

209
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Your gun?

210
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Only fools venture into the jungle without a proper gun.

211
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I don't think you need a gun, Papa.

212
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And why not?

213
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Because there aren't any wild animals.

214
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Well, one of the seas might have been an egg or something.

215
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Look at these, for instance, they look very animal.

216
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Very odd animals. More than odd plant, I think. I'd stay away from them. They could be very dangerous.

217
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But they've got eyes.

218
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Careful. I think they're man-eating plants.

219
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Man-eating.

220
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Stop that.

221
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Help! Help!

222
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,519
They're trying to eat me.

223
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,000
But they want to feed me to their young.

224
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, help me!

225
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh, help!

226
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:05,000
They're tearing my toe! Oh no! Oh dear! Oh oh! Oh oh! Oh! Oh!

227
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Help!

228
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh! Oh no!

229
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh oh!

230
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh oh!

231
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh oh!

232
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Well done my little Maya, just saved my life!

233
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Well I saved your tail anyway! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, That should keep them in now, shouldn't it?

234
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, I don't think they could push their way through that lot.

235
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Hmm, they had a very strong grip on my tail.

236
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He mustn't underestimate them.

237
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Anything wrong?

238
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You bet the sellers fall of man-eating plants,

239
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
trying to gobble up moment-papa!

240
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh!

241
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh, my goodness!

242
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!

243
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! You mustn't underestimate them. Anything wrong? You bet the seller's full of man-eating plants

244
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
trying to gobble up moment papa!

245
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh!

246
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh my goodness!

247
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What's the matter?

248
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You can get straight from the seller into the kitchen.

249
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What?

250
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh no, mama! Oh, hello. Cue, we got here just in time. Whatever's the matter with you, are you all playing Tarzan?

251
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh, no, mama.

252
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm making grandmas if you ever get a tropical fruit recipe.

253
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And perhaps now it's rained I can wash this dirty floor.

254
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Ah, I'm going to have a drink.

255
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm going to have a drink.

256
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm going to have a drink.

257
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm going to have a drink. I'm going to have a drink. making grandmas if you ever get a tropical fruit recipe and perhaps now it's reigned I can wash this dirty floor.

258
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Ah, by the great bumble I don't believe this a tropical rainforest.

259
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Ah, ah, a transcendentia, megaloids.

260
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And yes, at this Pepsi of Florium Wonder! Goodness me, I can collect a whole tropical

261
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Hermoreum right here in Mum and Valley!

262
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'd try, well, that's what I need. I'll get one from the Moomins!

263
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Must say they're not the tiniest family.

264
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll have to move this.

265
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh, this old furniture.

266
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yeah.

267
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah.

268
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Uh.

269
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Do I look that funny?

270
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
No, you look great!

271
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Maybe you and Tarzan have different muscles.

272
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Me, Tarzan!

273
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You, Jay.

274
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh, here we go.

275
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Me, get out with Ormysick!

276
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Ah!

277
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Ah, help!

278
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I've got many things planned after this!

279
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,960
What? They must have got out! Uh-huh.

280
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Ow!

281
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Uh-oh!

282
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,359
They were in the cellar.

283
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,599
Did you open the door, Mr. Hamillet?

284
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,000
Well, yes, I wanted to borrow a trowel. Mr. Hemmielin. Mr. Hemmielin, you know all about plants. Do you have any idea how we can get rid of them?

285
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
They're man-eaters, you know?

286
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Can't rid of them.

287
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Well, let's see.

288
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
We are in a bit of a fix.

289
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I have heard that they have reacted to music.

290
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Music.

291
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Snowfkin, you could play your harmonica.

292
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Hmm.

293
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Hmm.

294
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,839
I'm not sure if I can play it. I'm not sure if I can play it. the day of reacting music music. Snuffkin, you could play your harmonica.

295
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,000
Look, they've started dancing. Keep it up, snuffkin!

296
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What will they do if he stops playing?

297
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I really don't know.

298
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I don't know.

299
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't know.

300
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't know.

301
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I don't know.

302
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What's this? Oh!

303
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The rather sweet when they don't try to eat you.

304
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm not going to eat you.

305
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm not going to eat you.

306
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm not going to eat you.

307
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:52,079
I'm not going to eat you. I'm not going to eat you. I don't try to eat you.

308
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,000
And that was how a tropical jungle grew and surrounded

309
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,440
movement house in one night.

310
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,039
Is it going to stay?

311
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,799
And for how long?

312
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:27,099
And what will the man eating plants do if Snuffton stops playing? The movements. They're always happy and always at play.

313
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:30,599
The movements are having fun day after day.

314
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,299
The movements.

315
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:38,299
The movements.

316
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:41,700
They love the laughter and they love the living.

317
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:52,480
The movements. They love the living, the movements Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements

318
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,279
They're always happy and goes at play

319
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:13,359
The movements are having fun day after day, the Moves, the Moves
