0	8000	Off we go then, Hank is away, he won't have to road too hard, the wind will pick us up soon.
9000	12000	Goodbye, have a good time, everyone.
12000	17000	Goodbye, Snuffkin, now don't forget to shut all the windows if it rains, will you?
17000	18000	No.
23000	25000	Up towards!
31000	36000	Hey! Wait for me, I want to have a good time too!
36000	39000	Hey, wait!
42000	45000	Look, Snuff is still waving.
45000	47000	He's a sweet boy.
48000	51000	Let's keep waving, Moonman, till we're out of sight.
51000	54000	Bye, Snuffkin! Bye, bye!
54000	56000	Bye!
56000	60000	No, I'm not waving goodbye, I want to go too!
60000	63000	Don't eat all the road, Mary Tabo, we're gone!
63000	66000	It's no good shouting little Mai, he can't hear you.
66000	71000	He's giving us a great send-off though, for Snuff, he should have come with us.
76000	79000	Nancy, I'm going off and leaving me here on my own.
85000	89000	Snuffkin, if you wouldn't mind, I think we need some music to send us on our way.
89000	91000	What do you say?
115000	118000	Are you sure we're on the right course for the island, Papa?
118000	122000	Yes, the winds with us and the sails are fine.
122000	126000	I bet if we keep this speed up, we'll be there by tomorrow.
126000	130000	Well, if the wind stays like this, you could be right.
145000	148000	The wind's not dying down at all.
148000	151000	I'm surprised, I never thought we'd keep up this speed.
151000	153000	Now make sure you're allergic.
153000	159000	Of course we will be, Papa, if we carry on like this, perhaps we'll see the light from the lighthouse while it's still dark.
159000	162000	Well, we don't want to hit anything at this speed.
162000	164000	Don't worry, we're watching.
164000	167000	Ah, this is the light.
175000	179000	Papa, the wind's dropped.
179000	184000	Well, that's strange, it shouldn't happen that quickly.
184000	187000	Do you want us to start rowing, Moomin, Papa?
187000	191000	No, Snuffkin, I think we'd better get some sleep.
193000	197000	Stupid wind, I really wanted to see the lighthouse at night.
197000	199000	It's getting foggy too.
199000	201000	I can't even see the stars anymore.
201000	205000	Right, Snuffkin, wake me in two hours and I'll take over.
205000	208000	Okay, Moomin, Papa.
221000	224000	What's the matter, Little My?
226000	228000	I thought I heard something.
229000	232000	It's coming from over there somewhere.
232000	235000	Can you see anything?
235000	239000	No, but I can hear it.
239000	243000	It's so good eye, and it's getting closer.
250000	252000	Little Moomin, Papa, get up, Moomin!
252000	255000	Stop it, Little My! What's the matter with you?
255000	257000	You too, Moomin, quickly, before it's too late!
257000	259000	What's the matter, Little My?
259000	264000	I can hear her ship, I can't see it, but it's very close and getting closer.
264000	266000	A ship? Where?
266000	268000	Over there, and she's bearing down on us.
268000	270000	Quickly, we don't have much time.
273000	275000	Yes, by the boobalier right.
275000	277000	We must let them know we're here, a signal.
277000	279000	Right, all hands on deck.
279000	282000	Maybe if we all shout as loud as we can.
282000	284000	Look!
284000	286000	Oh!
291000	293000	Too late for shouting!
293000	295000	It's huge!
295000	298000	Look out! It's gonna hit us!
299000	301000	I think Moomin's right, what can we do?
301000	305000	It's too late for anything, just brace ourselves and be ready to swim for it.
310000	312000	Quick, get down, Little My!
315000	317000	Oh!
323000	325000	I don't believe it!
325000	327000	Little My!
330000	332000	Huh?
332000	334000	That's hard, the ship didn't hit us.
334000	336000	Oh yes, he did!
336000	337000	What?
337000	339000	It went straight into our rudder when nothing happened!
339000	341000	It went right through us!
341000	345000	Right through us, that's impossible she couldn't have.
345000	348000	I wonder if there was anyone on board that ship.
348000	350000	I can't see any lights.
350000	353000	I know, Snuffkin, I think it's a ghost ship.
353000	355000	A ghost ship?
355000	358000	Well, there's no wash and no damage to us.
358000	360000	It's the only explanation, I think she's right.
360000	363000	A ghost ship, we've actually seen one.
364000	368000	Oh dear, oh dear, I need to sit down, all this excitement's too much.
368000	373000	Papa, don't they say that if you see a ghost ship, something terrible is gonna happen to you?
373000	377000	What happened in the first place to make it become a ghost ship? That's what I wanna know.
377000	380000	Well, that's just some old sailor's tail, Moomin.
380000	384000	If it had been a real ship, we'd probably be sinking now.
384000	386000	Don't you think so, Snuffkin?
386000	388000	Yeah, I suppose.
388000	391000	That's one way of looking at it.
391000	394000	Come on, cheer up you guys, at least it was fun.
394000	396000	What's the matter?
396000	397000	Has something happened?
397000	398000	What are you laughing at?
398000	400000	What's so funny?
400000	402000	Are you going to tell us?
402000	405000	Why didn't you wake me up, Moomin?
405000	406000	Oh!
406000	409000	Well, I think we're doing very well.
409000	411000	We're doing very well.
411000	413000	We're doing very well.
414000	416000	Oh!
416000	419000	Well, I think we're doing very well.
420000	424000	Oh, what a beautiful sky, just look at it.
424000	427000	Oh, the fog is lifting.
444000	448000	Oh, what's it dozed off?
451000	454000	Another beautiful day, not a ghost ship in sight.
458000	461000	The lighthouse.
462000	464000	Hey, wake up everybody, the lighthouse.
464000	467000	I can see the lighthouse we're there.
469000	472000	Oh, the sun shining, we must have slept for hours.
472000	475000	Oh, there it is.
475000	477000	This is ridiculous.
477000	479000	We've been next to it all night.
479000	481000	We could have gone and slept there.
481000	483000	I can't wait to go ashore.
483000	486000	All right, everyone, jump to it.
486000	488000	Man the old.
491000	493000	There's something strange going on here.
493000	495000	What is it, Snuffkin?
495000	496000	I'm not sure.
496000	497000	Moomin Papa.
497000	499000	Our boat didn't move at all last night, did it?
499000	502000	No, it doesn't seem to have moved at all.
502000	504000	So why couldn't we see the light from the lighthouse,
504000	506000	even when the fog cleared?
506000	508000	I can't work it out.
508000	511000	Yes, you're right, Snuffkin, it seems very odd.
511000	513000	We should have seen it.
513000	516000	Well, perhaps the lighthouse keeper forgot to put it on, Moomin Papa.
516000	518000	I don't think so, little Mai.
518000	520000	You can't forget a thing like that.
520000	523000	I suppose it could be broken.
523000	525000	There could be lots of reasons for it.
525000	527000	Why don't we hurry up and get ashore,
527000	530000	and then we can ask the keeper.
533000	536000	Look, there's someone in a boat.
536000	537000	Hmm.
537000	540000	It looks like he's fishing.
540000	542000	He know about the lighthouse.
542000	544000	He probably lives on the island.
544000	546000	Let's get closer.
546000	548000	Easy now.
549000	558000	Now, hoi there, good morning.
558000	561000	Any luck?
561000	566000	Not yet, but it's still early.
566000	569000	Hmm, yes, quite.
569000	571000	I'll ask him straight out.
571000	574000	Do you know if the lighthouse was working last night?
574000	576000	I don't know.
577000	580000	Sorry, I didn't catch that.
581000	583000	He said, no, it wasn't.
583000	584000	What did I tell you?
584000	586000	He forgot to light it.
586000	588000	Oh, it wasn't only last night.
588000	590000	You'll never see a light in that lighthouse.
590000	592000	Not even on stormy nights.
592000	593000	We'll never.
593000	595000	So what does the keeper do then?
595000	596000	Nothing.
596000	598000	There is an lighthouse keeper.
598000	600000	Why?
600000	601000	I'm sorry.
601000	602000	I'm afraid I don't know.
602000	605000	All I can say is I haven't seen one.
605000	607000	Do you live on the island?
607000	609000	Hey, mister.
609000	611000	You're asking too many questions.
611000	613000	Who are you?
613000	617000	I'm Moment Papa from Moment Valley, and this is my family.
617000	620000	We've come a long way in order to do some important work here.
620000	622000	No work on this island.
622000	624000	No, you better go back home.
624000	629000	You see, I've come here to research an epic novel about the sea.
629000	631000	Just turn around and go back.
631000	633000	You're too far from home.
633000	635000	Oh, please, wait.
635000	636000	Shh.
636000	637000	Dear, don't shout.
637000	639000	We mustn't scare the fish away.
639000	641000	Let's go a show and have some breakfast.
641000	643000	I expect we're all hungry.
651000	653000	Bunny, pair.
653000	655000	The old ones lost his marbles.
663000	665000	The old ones lost his marbles.
665000	667000	The old ones lost his marbles.
667000	669000	The old ones lost his marbles.
669000	671000	The old ones lost his marbles.
671000	673000	The old ones lost his marbles.
673000	675000	The old ones lost his marbles.
675000	679000	Look, Moment Papa. There's a path here leading to the lighthouse.
679000	683000	We'll leave this stuff here and we'll go and explore it first.
683000	685000	Right, to the lighthouse, everyone.
685000	687000	Up, bow.
687000	689000	Come on!
689000	691000	What's wrong?
691000	695000	Why do you always get so upset when somebody mentions the lighthouse?
695000	697000	It's not your call, sir.
697000	699000	Business boy doesn't concern you at all.
699000	701000	You were like that when I asked you about it before.
701000	705000	Maybe if you were to tell me, I might be able to understand.
705000	707000	I could try anyway.
707000	709000	Either talk about something else or keep quiet.
709000	711000	You understand that?
721000	725000	It's so very rocky, I don't think it would work.
725000	729000	What? A garden.
739000	741000	Hello there!
741000	743000	Is there anybody at home?
743000	745000	There's nobody here.
745000	749000	That boy was right. It's been empty for ages, I think.
751000	757000	Oh, the door was left unlocked. I know we do it, but most people don't.
757000	759000	Something terrible's happened.
759000	763000	Something terrible! Please, little my, you know I had things like that.
763000	765000	Don't worry, snort maiden.
765000	767000	Little my, it's just trying to scare you.
767000	769000	I don't like hearing about anything horrible.
769000	773000	Flag your ears then, snort maiden, because I haven't finished yet.
773000	775000	And the next bit's really horrible.
775000	777000	Oh, well, where have you been finished there?
777000	781000	Well, the lighthouse keeper is still up there.
781000	783000	He got scurvy and hats and been able to move for months.
783000	785000	And nobody's heard his cries for help.
785000	787000	And with no food, he's almost a skeleton.
787000	793000	If he isn't dead already, he'll be at the top of the stairs, crawling towards his fingers,
793000	795000	lading and ripped up ribbons and flowers, mouth.
795000	797000	God, it's endless, mouth.
797000	799000	Shut up, little my.
799000	801000	That's enough.
801000	803000	It was a good imagination though.
803000	805000	I'll let you use it in your book, if you like.
805000	807000	Come on, tell me what did she say, Moonman?
807000	809000	Oh, nothing, really. Nothing at all.
809000	813000	Tell me, Moonman, but leave out the bits I wouldn't like.
813000	817000	Where are you going, Papa?
817000	819000	Well, listen, everyone.
819000	821000	First, I'm going to get the lamp working.
821000	825000	Then we'll give the place a good clean and then we'll move in.
825000	827000	We'll be the new lighthouse keepers.
827000	833000	And once again, the seas around this island will be safe for ships to navigate in troubled water.
833000	835000	Come on, Papa!
835000	837000	Careful, careful.
837000	839000	Touch anything, that's dangerous.
845000	847000	Oh!
855000	857000	Will Moonman Papa be able to get the light working again?
857000	859000	Where is the lighthouse keeper?
859000	861000	And what could have made him go without locking the door,
861000	867000	leaving the ships in peril and the seas with no one to guide them away from the rocks?
869000	873000	And who is the mysterious fisherman?
875000	881000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the moments.
881000	889000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
889000	893000	They're always happy and always at play.
893000	897000	The movements are having fun day after day.
897000	901000	The movements.
901000	905000	The movements.
905000	909000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
911000	919000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
919000	923000	They're always happy and always at play.
923000	927000	The movements are having fun day after day.
927000	931000	The movements.
931000	935000	The movements.
935000	939000	The movements.
959000	961000	Here they are for one and all.
961000	963000	The movements are about to come.
963000	967000	Come on and sit down here with me.
967000	969000	They're here for you on your TV.
969000	971000	They are the movements.
971000	975000	They are the movements.
975000	977000	So come with me.
977000	979000	Give me your hand.
979000	981000	I'll take you up to a moment land.
981000	985000	You can fly just like a bird.
985000	987000	Sing that song ever.
987000	989000	There were the movements.
989000	991000	There were the movements.
991000	995000	There were the movements.
995000	999000	There were the movements.
999000	1001000	There were the movements.
1001000	1005000	There were the movements.
1021000	1046840	The movements came to this island to visit a real lighthouse, but when they got there,
1046840	1054840	I found it was completely deserted, no light, and no lighthouse keeper.
1054840	1063840	Woman Papa is going to try and mend the lamp, and the others are all helping to clean up.
1063840	1066840	This is it, then. Do you think it's broken, Papa?
1066840	1075840	Well, I'm not sure. I've not had a great deal of experience with this sort of thing.
1075840	1080840	Look over there, woman. It's the boy and the fisherman from the boat.
1080840	1082840	They're a bit strange, aren't they?
1082840	1085840	They must live somewhere here on the island.
1085840	1090840	Hmm, let's see. Let's see.
1090840	1094840	Oh, my God.
1095840	1108840	Oh, thank you. Leave it by the door when you haven't quite finished yet.
1108840	1111840	Well, at least we can see the floor now.
1111840	1115840	I think the keeper must be lying dead under the dust.
1115840	1118840	Nobody's cleaned here for a long time, that's for sure.
1118840	1122840	That probably means the lighthouse lamp hasn't been working for ages either.
1123840	1126840	I wonder if Papa will be able to fix it.
1126840	1132840	I wonder if they're going to manage to get the light working all right.
1132840	1140840	Well, the lighthouse without a lamp is pretty sad, isn't it?
1140840	1142840	Come on, light, will you?
1142840	1148840	Right, I'll give you one last chance.
1148840	1153840	Then I'm getting the big spanner. Now, you don't know me, but I don't give in easily, especially to machines.
1153840	1162840	Have you thought, brass brain, what will happen tonight if there's a storm and there's a ship out there looking for land or trying to keep off the rocks and there's no light to guide them?
1162840	1164840	You'll be sorry, Dan, but it'll be too late.
1164840	1168840	And all I can say is that if the light hasn't been working for some time,
1168840	1171840	then I'm afraid that there could have been many shipwrecks.
1171840	1173840	Oh, that's awful.
1173840	1177840	It would be dangerous to come too close to the island without a light to help you.
1177840	1181840	I wouldn't be surprised if that ghost ship went one of them.
1181840	1187840	It all seems very strange, and I wonder what made the lighthouse keeper leave in such a hurry.
1187840	1190840	Unspeakable horror, please be quiet, little my.
1190840	1191840	It's obvious.
1191840	1195840	Close thrown above dishes left unwashed, jigsaw puzzles have finished.
1195840	1199840	It's an unsolved mystery of the sea, just like the Marie Celeste.
1199840	1203840	And if you don't understand that, then you're being even stupider.
1203840	1205840	Then usual.
1205840	1208840	Oh dear poor man, I wonder what he was like.
1208840	1212840	He must have been very lonely here on his own.
1212840	1216840	He scribbled messages over the walls like no side of a ship.
1216840	1218840	It's Christmas, another month gone.
1218840	1224840	I must clean the lamp, and I need to talk to someone.
1224840	1229840	Oh, well, if he didn't see many ships, at least they could have been many shipwrecks either.
1229840	1231840	Oh, I hope not Papa.
1231840	1233840	That would be one good thing anyway.
1233840	1238840	Perhaps the sea came and took him on a dark and stormy night, and he was swept out, and no one saw him go.
1238840	1240840	That's rubbish, little my.
1240840	1245840	On dark and stormy nights, lighthouse keeper sits safe by a fire drinking hot tea laced with rum.
1245840	1248840	He might have run out of rum and gone to get more.
1248840	1251840	Well, I don't think anything terrible happened to him.
1251840	1255840	He just got more and more lonely and fed up, and then went off and got a girlfriend.
1255840	1257840	Be careful, snuffkin.
1257840	1260840	It's very rough and not even, and you don't want to fall into the sea.
1260840	1262840	I certainly don't.
1262840	1265840	Now, watch your step. The rocks are very slippery.
1265840	1268840	Are you alright?
1268840	1272840	Yes, Lang, so I didn't think they'd be a slippery as all that.
1272840	1274840	What's the matter?
1274840	1277840	Look over there. There's something moving, but I can't see what it is.
1277840	1279840	It's probably a boat.
1279840	1282840	No, that's what I call a real ship.
1282840	1284840	It's not a real one.
1284840	1286840	What do you mean?
1286840	1289840	It's the ghost ship, the one we saw last night.
1289840	1294840	You're right. Why isn't it come back snuffkin? What does it want?
1294840	1299840	I don't know. Perhaps it followed us to the island and for some reason wants to make contact.
1299840	1309840	Let's go home snuffkin. I don't like this.
1330840	1334840	What's up?
1334840	1338840	I'm having a great dream and you can be with me.
1338840	1341840	Oh, it was horrible. Someone stepped on my face.
1341840	1343840	Well, none of us sleep.
1343840	1345840	We were all asleep. What are you doing?
1345840	1347840	It's very odd.
1350840	1353840	No, somebody's on my stomach now.
1353840	1356840	Don't be stupid.
1356840	1361840	Oh, I have a look snuffkin. There must be something there. Please snuffkin, please.
1361840	1364840	I can't see any.
1364840	1366840	What's that?
1366840	1367840	What is it?
1367840	1371840	I don't know yet, movement. I think I can see a pair of feet.
1371840	1372840	A pair of feet.
1372840	1374840	No legs, just feet.
1374840	1376840	But that means a ghost.
1376840	1379840	Oh, help! Get it off me! Go away, go away!
1379840	1385840	Let me at them! Where are they? I'll teach them to spoil my dream!
1385840	1388840	They're on my face now. Go away, will you?
1388840	1390840	Show me it, but no, stamp on it!
1390840	1391840	Stop it, move!
1391840	1393840	No, it's my foot!
1409840	1411840	You go fishing again today?
1411840	1412840	No, I'm not.
1412840	1416840	Oh, do you need me or is it alright if I go and see those people?
1416840	1417840	In the lighthouse.
1417840	1419840	Oh, don't let you want.
1419840	1421840	Okay, goodbye then.
1427840	1429840	You mean this room is really haunted?
1429840	1431840	It certainly is.
1431840	1433840	But we only saw a pair of feet.
1434840	1437840	I'll sleep here tonight. Don't worry. I'll protect you.
1437840	1439840	Are you going to scare it away, Papa?
1439840	1441840	Mm-hmm.
1443840	1445840	I can't find any good shells.
1445840	1447840	You're me.
1451840	1453840	What about this one?
1453840	1455840	Oh, yes, that's lovely.
1457840	1460840	Go on, take it. I don't collect them.
1463840	1464840	Who are you?
1464840	1466840	Well, I'm a ghost, sort of.
1466840	1468840	Are you the rat who walked over us last night?
1468840	1470840	You were lucky I didn't grab you.
1470840	1472840	Sorry, it wasn't just me.
1472840	1473840	There were a few of us.
1473840	1474840	And walk over each other.
1474840	1476840	Can I give you a present?
1476840	1478840	You can't get around me that easily.
1478840	1480840	You better show yourselves or you'll be sorry.
1480840	1482840	It's just me.
1482840	1484840	The others have all left me and gone off with the ship.
1484840	1487840	Ha, so why didn't you go with them?
1487840	1490840	Oh, I wanted to, but uh, well...
1490840	1492840	Come on, out with it.
1492840	1498840	Never got me and left me all of my own and I was frightened.
1498840	1502840	Well, I can see why they wouldn't want a drippy thing like you around.
1502840	1504840	You call yourself a ghost.
1504840	1507840	No, I'm sorry.
1507840	1510840	I just can't work out what's wrong with it.
1510840	1513840	Let's try and see what happens here.
1513840	1518840	Oh, oh, oh, oh, heavens, oh, my.
1518840	1520840	Oh, good.
1520840	1523840	Oh, no, oh, what?
1530840	1532840	You were right, papa!
1532840	1534840	Oh, thank goodness you're here.
1534840	1537840	Quick, open all the windows, I'm choking!
1537840	1543840	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
1550840	1560840	Mmm, this is great. That soup I've had for ages, Moome and Mama.
1560840	1561840	Would you like some more?
1561840	1568840	Oh, he has, please. Can I have the recipe? I could make some for the fisherman. I know he'd love it.
1568840	1571840	I'll write it out for you. What's his name?
1571840	1577840	I don't know. He doesn't say. I've come from the north. I left about three months ago.
1577840	1583840	Although it seems a lot longer, and I'd been rowing south in my small boat, trying to reach Moome and Valley.
1583840	1585840	Oh, really? We live there.
1585840	1590840	Do you? You're lucky. It must be very nice. I've never been there, but I've heard that it's beautiful.
1590840	1598840	Anyway, there was a violent storm in my little boat capsized. He rescued me, and I've stayed with him in his cabin ever since.
1598840	1602840	And he doesn't talk about himself at all. That's very strange.
1602840	1605840	No, but I think he does have a big secret.
1606840	1607840	How do you know, Toft?
1607840	1612840	Well, sometimes he just stares and stares at the lighthouse in any sort of size.
1612840	1613840	I wonder why.
1613840	1617840	I did ask him once, but he glared at me in such a nasty way.
1617840	1619840	I haven't dared say a word about it since.
1619840	1621840	You don't want to stay with him then?
1621840	1630840	Oh, yes. Well, most of the time he's really nice to me, and since I've been here, I've sort of taken care of him, because you see he doesn't really look after himself.
1630840	1633840	Can I have a cup of tea, please, Mama?
1634840	1637840	Yes, dear. How is the light coming along?
1637840	1640840	Oh, not very well. There's still a few more things I could try, though.
1640840	1643840	Hello. You were on that boat fishing, weren't you?
1643840	1646840	Yes, I was. My name is Toft, Mum and Papa.
1646840	1652840	Oh, please, to meet you. Is your friend here as well? I wanted to ask him something. There's something ever quite important.
1652840	1653840	Ask him what?
1653840	1656840	Well, about this lighthouse for one thing.
1656840	1659840	Well, he won't talk about that. He just refuses to.
1659840	1664840	Oh, dear, does he? The thing is, I'm trying to light this beacon, but having no success.
1664840	1669840	I wondered whether he might know if there's an easy way of doing it. You never know. I haven't missed something.
1669840	1672840	It's very quiet.
1672840	1674840	He might be out fishing, you know.
1674840	1676840	Come on, let's go.
1676840	1678840	Where are you going, Moomin?
1678840	1680840	I want to ask that man some questions.
1680840	1683840	He doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who does a lot of talking.
1683840	1686840	Do you think he might know something about the lighthouse keeper?
1686840	1688840	That's what I want to find out.
1690840	1700840	Hello, my name is Moomin, and this is my friend Snuffkin.
1700840	1703840	What's your business here?
1703840	1709840	I wonder, do you live here? I suppose you must have met the lighthouse keeper, have you?
1709840	1711840	I didn't want people to talk about that.
1711840	1715840	We were just curious about why you left the lighthouse. Do you know why?
1715840	1718840	No, he kept himself to himself.
1718840	1723840	Oh, so you do know it. When did he leave? Where did he go? You must know.
1723840	1724840	Get.
1724840	1728840	Oh, please. Had the light stopped working before he left?
1728840	1732840	Why did he leave the door open? Were there any shipwrecks?
1732840	1735840	Oh! Wait a minute. Just one more question, please.
1735840	1739840	Oh, don't go. There's something very important I need to know.
1739840	1742840	You're the only other person on the island apart from the go ship.
1742840	1746840	Oh, please come back. Look, my father is trying to get the lamp working again,
1746840	1750840	but not getting anywhere. So if you know where the keeper is, or better still,
1750840	1754840	how to light it when you please help, it's not only for us, but for all those ships
1754840	1758840	that might be in danger without it.
1760840	1762840	Moomin.
1762840	1765840	I don't think that man knows much about anything.
1765840	1769840	Well, at least he's heard you and knows what you want.
1769840	1771840	Let's go, Moomin.
1777840	1782840	Look, over there, what's Moomin Papa doing?
1782840	1786840	Snork made an a little Maya helping him.
1786840	1788840	Hiya!
1788840	1790840	Come on.
1790840	1792840	Yeah.
1792840	1796840	It's about time. Where are you two being?
1796840	1800840	What are you building now? We're making a raft. Why?
1800840	1804840	Because we wanted to stupid, why else would we build it? Do you like it?
1804840	1806840	But why do you want a raft?
1806840	1809840	It's not really a raft, is it Papa?
1809840	1812840	Let me present our very own hand-built ghost ship.
1812840	1814840	A ghost ship?
1814840	1818840	He must be here somewhere.
1818840	1822840	Well, if he's the one that walked on me last night, I want a word with him.
1822840	1826840	Yeah, sorry. I'm afraid that was me.
1826840	1828840	I want a word with him.
1828840	1831840	Yeah, sorry. I'm afraid that was me and my friends.
1831840	1833840	Oh, where are you?
1833840	1836840	Show us a bit of leg at least. I like to see you I'm talking to.
1836840	1839840	Yes, all right.
1839840	1843840	Oh, well, at least he looks like a ghost.
1843840	1844840	Thank you.
1844840	1847840	Ghosts look pretty silly when the sun's shining if you ask me.
1847840	1849840	Well, it was your idea.
1849840	1851840	I always thought ghosts were frightening.
1851840	1853840	Yes, we forgot our chains last night.
1853840	1855840	It's very hard to be ghostly without them.
1855840	1857840	We did our best to scare you, though.
1857840	1860840	The ghost came to this island because a lighthouse was a bit like an ancient castle.
1860840	1862840	We feel more at home in castle.
1862840	1865840	And now when they found us here, they changed their minds and gave up.
1865840	1867840	That's funny, isn't it?
1867840	1869840	What's the matter?
1869840	1871840	You look a bit fed up.
1871840	1874840	That's because he's been left behind by the other ghosts.
1874840	1876840	They've gone off in the ghost ship.
1876840	1879840	Wow, they didn't tell me they were going straight away.
1879840	1882840	And I'd gone to the lighthouse keepers cabin.
1882840	1884840	The lighthouse keeper?
1884840	1885840	Why did you go there?
1885840	1888840	Well, I wanted to tell him that some strange people.
1888840	1889840	I'm sorry.
1889840	1893840	I mean, strangers had moved into the lighthouse and that he'd be better off with us
1893840	1895840	because ghosts don't damage things.
1895840	1897840	I didn't know you then, of course.
1897840	1898840	But some people are very kind.
1898840	1899840	Where is his cabin?
1899840	1901840	Is it easy to find?
1901840	1903840	At the southern end of the island.
1903840	1906840	But it was a waste of time because he wouldn't talk to me.
1906840	1907840	I shouldn't have bothered.
1907840	1909840	And then I would have caught the boat.
1909840	1912840	Anyway, he's not going back to his job, so that's that.
1913840	1914840	Bye-bye.
1914840	1916840	Thanks again for the raft.
1916840	1917840	Take care.
1917840	1920840	I hope you catch up with your friends real soon.
1920840	1921840	Thank you.
1921840	1922840	You're okay for mortals.
1922840	1925840	I promise next time we meet Abbey Rally's scurry.
1925840	1926840	Chains and all.
1926840	1929840	Lots of chains and we promise to be terrified.
1929840	1932840	You can come and scare me anytime you want.
1932840	1934840	Bye-bye.
1934840	1935840	Relating a try.
1935840	1936840	Bye-bye.
1936840	1937840	Bye-bye.
1937840	1941840	He said anything that could float would do.
1941840	1944840	But that raft seemed a bit flimsy to me.
1944840	1945840	I wouldn't like to chance it.
1945840	1947840	It can be rough out there.
1947840	1949840	Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
1949840	1950840	Those can't drown.
1950840	1951840	Can they?
1951840	1952840	They're dead already.
1959840	1960840	Mama.
1960840	1962840	What is it, Mum and Dia?
1962840	1964840	Papa's gone fishing again.
1964840	1967840	Well, he enjoys it.
1967840	1969840	Well, that's all he seems to do these days.
1969840	1972840	He's not working on the lamp at all.
1972840	1975840	Well, perhaps living in a new place makes him want to do a new thing.
1975840	1978840	And he does catch one now and again.
1983840	1985840	What are you making, little boy?
1985840	1986840	An elevator.
1986840	1988840	An elevator?
1988840	1991840	Yes, and when that's finished, I'm going to build a house.
1991840	1992840	Oh, my goodness.
1992840	1994840	A house of my very own.
2000840	2002840	Mum and Papa doesn't seem his usual happy self,
2002840	2005840	even though he enjoys his fishing.
2005840	2008840	He's upset that he couldn't make the lamp work
2008840	2010840	and isn't used to failure,
2010840	2013840	but nothing he tries makes any difference.
2013840	2015840	What a pity it would be to leave the island
2015840	2018840	without seeing the beautiful beams shining over the water.
2029840	2032840	What a pity it would be to leave the island.
2032840	2035840	And when that's finished, I'm going to build a house of my own.
2035840	2038840	I'll build a house of my own.
2041840	2043840	And that's all he's got.
2048840	2053840	Yeah, hey, coming up along, everyone, I've finished my house.
2053840	2054840	Ah!
2055840	2057840	Hey, Mum and Papa!
2057840	2059840	Come here, the fisherman's coming!
2060840	2061840	Wow, the fisherman!
2064840	2065840	Yes, and the boy is with them!
2065840	2067840	He's off to his outside?
2074840	2076840	You don't want to do it, do you?
2076840	2078840	No, but I gotta do it.
2080840	2081840	Right!
2088840	2090840	Here you are.
2095840	2098840	So, what can we do for you?
2104840	2105840	Oh!
2108840	2111840	Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you!
2112840	2113840	Hmm?
2113840	2118840	Tough just told us it's your birthday today, so all the best wishes from us.
2118840	2121840	My birthday? Is it really?
2121840	2124840	Excuse me for asking, but how old are you?
2124840	2126840	I just don't remember.
2126840	2130840	It doesn't matter. I'm sorry we don't have any presents.
2133840	2136840	I haven't had coffee for many, many years.
2137840	2140840	Bring the barrel, woman mama.
2140840	2141840	Yes, dear.
2142840	2144840	Now, let me see. I found this...
2144840	2145840	...sawester.
2146840	2149840	I wonder if it suits me. What do you think?
2149840	2150840	Well...
2150840	2153840	I suppose this must belong to the lighthouse keeper.
2156840	2158840	Why don't you try it on?
2158840	2161840	You look good in a sowester. There it suits you.
2161840	2168840	We'd love to know why you left the island and why you didn't come back here.
2168840	2171840	And also why you didn't like the land.
2171840	2175840	We really would like to know if you feel you could tell us.
2177840	2179840	I was so lonely.
2179840	2181840	For years and years.
2181840	2184840	Then I just went away.
2185840	2187840	I'm afraid that's all.
2188840	2192840	But you did come back. Surely that must mean something.
2192840	2197840	I knew I'd lived here for too long. Much too long.
2197840	2200840	You see, I didn't really fit in anywhere else.
2206840	2211840	This is the lighthouse keeper's uniform, isn't it? Why don't you put it on again?
2211840	2215840	And look, it's nice here. I'd like to stay. Would you mind that?
2215840	2217840	I'll stay if you let me.
2217840	2219840	Ah, I'd love that.
2219840	2223840	It'd be fun to see you looking like a lighthouse keeper.
2233840	2236840	Oh, hooray!
2245840	2249840	Three days later, the Moomans left the island.
2249840	2257840	They decided to leave at night with the safe blow of the lighthouse beans guiding their path out and away to Mooman Valley.
2257840	2265840	Mooman Papa had quite forgotten about his epic novel of the sea, but couldn't wait to start again on his memoirs.
2266840	2270840	The Moomans
2271840	2278840	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomans
2278840	2285840	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomans
2286840	2296840	They're always happy and always at play. The Moomans are having fun day after day. The Moomans
2296840	2300840	The Moomans
2300840	2307840	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomans
2307840	2314840	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomans
2315840	2325840	They're always happy and always at play. The Moomans are having fun day after day. The Moomans
2325840	2329840	The Moomans
2329840	2335840	The Moomans
2344840	2369840	Here they are for one and all. The Moomans are about to call. Come on and sit down here with me. They're for you on your TV. They are the Moomans
2369840	2372840	They are the Moomans
2372840	2375840	So come with me, give me your hand
2375840	2378840	I'll take you up to a moment land
2378840	2381840	You can fly just like a bird
2381840	2386840	Sing that song ever, there were the Moomans
2386840	2389840	There were the Moomans
2389840	2392840	There were the Moomans
2392840	2395840	There were the Moomans
2395840	2398840	There were the Moomans
2398840	2401840	There were the Moomans
2407840	2410840	Mom
2413840	2415840	Everything's so boring
2415840	2416840	Let's do something then
2416840	2422840	Like what, for instance, I think we've done everything one could possibly do
2422840	2426840	None of you three can think of a single thing to do. You're useless, aren't you?
2426840	2430840	Well, can you think of anything except catching grasshoppers?
2430840	2433840	There must be something we can do
2433840	2440840	Now we've all had times like this, haven't we? Fortunately, right then, the mailman arrived
2440840	2443840	Hello, a letter for you
2443840	2447840	Oh, a letter that must be from my sister for me
2447840	2450840	Oh no, it's from a woman Papa this time
2450840	2455840	That's all? Who would write to him? A woman? Someone called Jane?
2455840	2456840	Huh?
2456840	2458840	See that he gets it now
2458840	2460840	Who could this Jane possibly be?
2460840	2463840	It's your father's old girlfriend, of course
2463840	2464840	Never
2464840	2466840	Oh, I'm sure he had dozens and dozens
2466840	2469840	Moom and Papa was very kind and handsome young man
2469840	2471840	A voice from the past
2471840	2474840	Moom and Papa, liquid, I've got for you
2475840	2476840	Hmm
2478840	2480840	Oh, no
2480840	2481840	I was right
2481840	2482840	Yeah, you were
2484840	2487840	Moom and Mama, I think you should go back to the kitchen
2487840	2489840	Whatever, for a little lie
2489840	2492840	Because Moom and Papa store me youth is catching up with him
2492840	2495840	Please, Papa, tell us it's not that kind of letter
2495840	2498840	Oh, what would you do?
2499840	2500840	Don't worry
2500840	2505840	Whatever it was, it was a long time ago, long before I ever met you
2505840	2508840	No, it's not that kind of letter
2508840	2510840	What sort of letter is it then?
2510840	2513840	Oh, much worse, it's from Aunt Jane
2513840	2514840	Who's that?
2514840	2517840	Mine, my dear, is on my father's side
2517840	2519840	Oh, how boring
2519840	2522840	You look very pale suddenly, dear
2522840	2525840	Yes, because she's coming for a visit tomorrow
2525840	2530840	Oh, don't worry, there's plenty of time for arranging a welcome party
2530840	2534840	But I don't like her, and I don't want her to come for a visit
2534840	2536840	Moom and Papa, why not?
2536840	2538840	Well, you'll soon see, she's very rich
2538840	2540840	Very rich
2540840	2544840	Yes, and she bosses everyone, and we won't have a moment of peace
2544840	2548840	Oh, maybe she's so rich, she'll give us all wonderful presents
2548840	2553840	Goodness, this is so unexpected, why is she coming here all of a sudden?
2553840	2558840	Oh, she says she wants to discuss money matters, good heavens with me
2558840	2561840	She says there's no one else, so you see, I'm in a very difficult situation
2561840	2564840	Oh, why can't you tell if you're not an expert?
2564840	2568840	You don't tell Aunt Jane things, she tells you when that's that
2568840	2570840	Is that what you explained?
2570840	2572840	When you meet her, you'll know exactly what I mean
2572840	2575840	What do I know about money matters?
2575840	2576840	Nothing
2576840	2578840	Not surprising since we've never had any
2578840	2582840	How can she expect a poor creature like you to know anything about money?
2582840	2585840	Also, she's very, very suspicious
2585840	2588840	And she says money is a terrible burden
2588840	2591840	Oh, I wouldn't mind shouldering her burden
2591840	2594840	Maybe you'll inherit it, and then we could share the money
2594840	2597840	And have a wonderful time together
2598840	2620840	This time, I almost did it
2620840	2650840	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
2650840	2679840	I'm sure she jumped at it. Hmm, there'd be no harm in asking, I guess. What's the matter, Mr.
2679840	2685840	Hamilton, you look so unhappy. I'm stuck, that's my problem. How's that?
2686840	2696840	Stuck in my research, this magnifying glass is very good, of course, but I just can't get any further with my botanical research with this old fashioned equipment.
2697840	2706840	What I really need is a microscope and a laboratory. Hmm, and they're expensive, I guess. Yes, they are, and I don't have any money.
2706840	2713840	Well, moment Papa's aunt is coming over tomorrow, and I know she's got any amount of money. Any amount, Sniff?
2714840	2724840	I'll get her to finance you, Hamilton, and we'll get a big greenhouse, and you'll grow orchids and roses and other things, and then we'll sell them, oh, oh, I'll get rich. You too!
2736840	2764840	Hey, you over there. Hmm, are you talking to me? Of course I am. Who else? I say do you know the way to move in a house young man? Yes, she might say I do. Show me where it is then.
2765840	2773840	Over there, it's tall and blue, just follow that stream and you can't miss it. Good, would you be kind enough to take my suitcase?
2774840	2779840	I'm sorry I can't, I'm too busy. I'll reward you handsomely for your efforts, think again young man.
2780840	2784840	But all I want to do is fish. What? You don't want money?
2785840	2791840	I heard you were coming to visit moment Papa, you're a Jane, aren't you?
2791840	2797840	Oh, well, please to meet you, I'm here to take you to moment house. Is this your suitcase?
2800840	2803840	Wow, this suitcase is very heavy.
2803840	2806840	Should be, it's full of golden coins.
2807840	2813840	Oh, I'll take care of this. Let's go and take.
2822840	2829840	I can't stay in this house, I don't think I can take Aunt Jane. I'm going to hide out in the cave until she's gone.
2830840	2842840	Bye bye, then dear. Careful now Aunt Jane. The banks have been slippery here and there.
2849840	2853840	A roundhouse, how stupid, typical of my nephew.
2853840	2856840	Welcome to moment house Aunt Jane.
2856840	2858840	Welcome Aunt Jane.
2858840	2861840	I'd like you to meet us up in a minute.
2861840	2863840	Please to meet you.
2865840	2867840	She's very small for a daughter.
2867840	2871840	Oh little Mai isn't ours, she just lives here.
2871840	2873840	And I won't get any bigger, either.
2873840	2876840	Hmm, she's like a member of the family.
2876840	2880840	And where's my worthless nephew? Why isn't he here?
2880840	2884840	Oh, well, he's not, is he not at home?
2885840	2888840	Well, no, when will he be back? I don't know.
2888840	2892840	He's away looking for inspiration for his work, so he won't be back for a while.
2892840	2895840	Since when has he worked? I'm here to see him.
2895840	2897840	Maybe you can see me instead.
2897840	2901840	What a splendid idea, how clever of you, moment.
2901840	2903840	Ridiculous, he knows nothing about money.
2903840	2910840	In that case, it is high time he learned. As for his father, I may still disinherit him.
2911840	2915840	I'm a member of his family, too. I could talk to you about money matters.
2915840	2916840	Really?
2916840	2919840	Oh, sniff is a great friend of mine.
2919840	2921840	Hmm.
2921840	2925840	But hardly a member of the family.
2925840	2929840	Hello, moment. And you must be on Jane.
2929840	2934840	I brought my brother to snort with me. He wanted to meet you.
2934840	2937840	This is Aunt Jane, the nice dog.
2938840	2940840	Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane.
2940840	2945840	This is my lovely sister, snort maiden, who is Moomin's special friend.
2945840	2948840	The snorts and the Moomin's may one day be related.
2948840	2951840	So in a way, we're all really family.
2951840	2954840	You maybe, but not to me.
2954840	2959840	I'm an inventor, and due to an accident, I'm looking around for a sponsor.
2959840	2963840	A golden opportunity for anyone with some loose capital.
2963840	2966840	Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane.
2966840	2969840	I'm Hemmielin, a botanist of note.
2969840	2973840	I heard that you might be willing to fund my scientific research, Aunt Jane.
2973840	2977840	A golden opportunity for anyone with some spare money, eh?
2977840	2979840	You'd like me to fund your research?
2979840	2981840	It was my idea.
2981840	2986840	If we built a greenhouse and grow rare orchids and roses, we can make a lot of money.
2986840	2988840	And you'll make a lot of money.
2988840	2990840	Young man, I have a lot of money already.
2990840	2993840	Oh, hasn't sniff discussed this with you, Mom?
2993840	2994840	Yes, sniff.
2994840	2996840	Well, I was just getting around to it, Hemmielin.
2996840	2997840	Confusing?
2997840	3001840	When I am famous for my botanical research, Aunt Jane, I...
3001840	3003840	I don't know that will ever happen.
3003840	3005840	This is very confusing indeed for me.
3005840	3008840	Now, you're snorkemaid and a friend of Moomin, is that right?
3008840	3010840	Oh, no, I'm the snorric snort maiden's brother.
3010840	3012840	I'm a friend of Moomin, Aunt Jane.
3012840	3015840	Did you really explain about my important research, Sniff?
3015840	3018840	Did you really explain that I'm a member of the family?
3018840	3020840	Hey, she got it!
3020840	3024840	So, Aunt Jane would be grateful to all of you and make you a member of the family.
3024840	3026840	Thank you, Aunt Jane.
3038840	3040840	Here's your rule, Aunt Jane.
3040840	3044840	Oh, I do hope you'll be comfortable here.
3044840	3046840	Just call if you need anything.
3051840	3053840	Oh...
3053840	3055840	Come out.
3060840	3062840	Here's your suitcase.
3062840	3063840	It was very heavy.
3063840	3064840	Thank you.
3067840	3069840	Hemm...
3069840	3070840	What is it?
3070840	3071840	You want a reward?
3071840	3073840	No, no, Aunt Jane.
3073840	3077840	I mean, yes, I do, but...
3078840	3079840	Uh...
3079840	3080840	Which is it?
3080840	3082840	Will you make up your mind, young man?
3082840	3085840	I know where Moomin Papa is right now.
3085840	3087840	He's a whale and a trip, I know.
3087840	3089840	No, no. He's somewhere quite near.
3089840	3091840	Quite near here?
3091840	3092840	Well, where is he?
3092840	3095840	Moomin Papa said not to tell you where he's hiding.
3095840	3096840	It's a secret.
3096840	3097840	A secret?
3097840	3098840	Yes.
3098840	3101840	I suppose I could tell you, but he'll be very angry.
3101840	3103840	Where is he? Tell me now.
3103840	3106840	Well, if I tell you I'm taking a big risk...
3106840	3107840	Hmm.
3107840	3108840	Oh, very well.
3108840	3110840	How much do you want?
3110840	3112840	I'll leave that to you.
3134840	3136840	Thank you for the information.
3136840	3138840	Now you shall have your reward.
3138840	3140840	Hold out your hand.
3140840	3143840	Oh, is that all?
3143840	3147840	Until I've seen him for myself with my own eyes.
3147840	3148840	Yes!
3154840	3155840	Huh?
3155840	3156840	What?
3156840	3159840	Oh, there's nobody here.
3159840	3161840	Where is my worthless nephew?
3161840	3164840	Hey, this is very strange.
3164840	3167840	You tricked me, haven't you?
3167840	3170840	Well, no, I swear I would never do that.
3170840	3173840	You certainly deserve no reward.
3173840	3174840	Huh?
3174840	3175840	But no, wait.
3175840	3177840	If we just look around, we'll find him.
3177840	3179840	He's in here somewhere I know it.
3179840	3182840	Hey, Moomin Papa, I got rid of her.
3187840	3189840	Moomin, Mama.
3189840	3191840	Yes, Aunt Jane, what is it?
3191840	3194840	Tell me where my nephew is hiding.
3194840	3196840	Well, as I said before...
3196840	3198840	I want to know the truth.
3198840	3199840	Dear, he's...
3199840	3201840	Now let me see...
3201840	3202840	Come on, hurry up.
3202840	3205840	He's hiding in the cave down by the beach.
3205840	3209840	I've just been there, Moomin Mama, and I can't find him.
3209840	3212840	Then he really must have gone away on a trip.
3212840	3215840	And why should he want to hide from me anyway?
3215840	3218840	I think he might be a little bit afraid of you.
3218840	3219840	Afraid of me?
3219840	3221840	Afraid of his own aunt?
3221840	3223840	But why?
3223840	3225840	Mostly he's afraid of money matters.
3225840	3226840	Incredible.
3226840	3229840	Afraid of me because of money matters?
3229840	3232840	He must be utterly mad.
3232840	3234840	What a family.
3234840	3236840	I don't understand.
3236840	3242840	It seems that only Smith knows anything about money.
3242840	3245840	I know where Moomin Papa is right now.
3245840	3248840	So you want some of my gold, who do you young lady?
3248840	3251840	I couldn't care less about your silly gold.
3251840	3253840	My silly gold indeed.
3253840	3257840	With silly gold, I assure you you can do just anything you want.
3257840	3262840	Seems to me your silly gold doesn't even help you to find Moomin Papa.
3262840	3263840	Hmm?
3263840	3265840	I think you should forget about your money.
3265840	3269840	Young lady, money isn't something you can just forget about.
3269840	3271840	It needs constant looking after.
3271840	3274840	That's why I must talk to Moomin Papa at once.
3274840	3277840	Now take me to that rascal nephew of mine.
3277840	3280840	If you really know where he is, do you hear me?
3280840	3283840	Do you have me?
3283840	3284840	Of course.
3284840	3286840	Oh wow, frivolous.
3286840	3287840	Not really.
3287840	3292840	If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too.
3292840	3295840	Oh well, Frederick and I were frivolous once.
3295840	3296840	Really?
3296840	3297840	Of course.
3297840	3298840	Oh wow, frivolous.
3298840	3299840	Not really.
3299840	3302840	If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too.
3302840	3303840	I'd be frivolous once.
3303840	3304840	Really?
3304840	3308840	If you say so, I suppose I have to believe you.
3311840	3312840	Huh?
3312840	3313840	Look.
3313840	3314840	What?
3314840	3317840	Little May and Anne Jane walking together.
3319840	3321840	What are they doing?
3321840	3323840	Little May is plotting something.
3323840	3324840	Really?
3324840	3326840	Moomin?
3326840	3333840	Sniffs are right, really.
3333840	3338840	But sometimes he just can't withstand the lure of gold.
3338840	3340840	Check me.
3340840	3341840	No.
3341840	3343840	Well you can't be right.
3343840	3345840	Let's go back then.
3345840	3349840	Fine, just take your time.
3349840	3350840	Hi guys.
3350840	3353840	Little May, what's the matter?
3353840	3354840	We have a guest.
3354840	3355840	A guest?
3356840	3357840	Hmm.
3357840	3359840	Move it, Papa.
3359840	3360840	What?
3360840	3362840	Move it, Papa.
3366840	3368840	Oh, so?
3368840	3371840	This is where you've been hiding.
3371840	3372840	Oh, what else?
3372840	3373840	Wait.
3373840	3376840	Oh, I'm here to shoot you.
3376840	3378840	I'm here to save your friend.
3378840	3380840	Wait, Jane.
3380840	3381840	No, you wait.
3381840	3382840	What are you worst?
3383840	3385840	Wait, please.
3385840	3388840	Moomin, Papa, was sort of on his way back from a trip
3388840	3391840	and then stopped by to play chess with me.
3391840	3392840	Yes.
3392840	3393840	Exactly.
3393840	3394840	No, yes.
3394840	3396840	Moomin, Mama told you the truth.
3396840	3399840	Oh, I sort of stopped by.
3399840	3401840	Why are you so afraid of me, young man?
3401840	3403840	Well, I'm not, not really.
3403840	3405840	I mean, it's not you.
3405840	3406840	It's your money.
3406840	3407840	I'm afraid of it.
3407840	3408840	Really scared.
3408840	3410840	Scared of my money?
3410840	3413840	Well, I'm not.
3413840	3416840	It's perfectly good money and all in gold coins.
3416840	3417840	Listen, nephew.
3417840	3419840	I'm depending on you as my only relative.
3419840	3420840	Yes, yes.
3420840	3421840	Please depend.
3421840	3423840	When I get too old to do it,
3423840	3425840	you must look after my gold for me.
3425840	3426840	I'm relying on you.
3426840	3428840	No, that's not possible.
3428840	3431840	I know, and Jane, we can give it all away.
3431840	3433840	Must be those who'd love to have it.
3433840	3435840	Must be those who need it more than we do.
3435840	3437840	Oh, a green pearl.
3441840	3443840	Ah, ah, ah, ah.
3443840	3446840	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
3446840	3449840	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
3449840	3452840	She's crazy.
3452840	3454840	Don't worry.
3454840	3456840	We'll think of something.
3456840	3459840	Oh, you would throw my money away without a cut.
3459840	3462840	Why didn't you mean to hurt you, Aunt Jane?
3462840	3463840	I know.
3463840	3464840	Let's put it all in the bank.
3464840	3466840	Money likes being in the bank.
3466840	3469840	My money would hate being in a bag.
3469840	3471840	It could be a terrible idea.
3471840	3472840	Oh, no.
3472840	3474840	Banks are so nice nowadays.
3477840	3478840	They are.
3478840	3481840	Of course, they have flowers and shiny piggy banks
3481840	3483840	and pretty paintings on the wall.
3483840	3486840	Is that really true?
3486840	3487840	Right.
3487840	3489840	Come on, everybody.
3489840	3492840	Let's hurry home and fix a welcoming party for Aunt Jane.
3492840	3493840	A party?
3493840	3496840	Yes, any reason is good enough.
3499840	3507840	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
3507840	3510840	This was Grandma's best cake recipe.
3510840	3512840	Welcome at Jane.
3512840	3515840	Let's drink a toast to the only millionaire
3515840	3517840	in our small circle.
3517840	3520840	May she live a long and healthy life.
3520840	3521840	Cheers!
3521840	3522840	Cheers!
3522840	3523840	Cheers!
3523840	3532840	Now, this is your welcoming party at Jane.
3532840	3533840	What's the matter?
3533840	3535840	Never in my life of I and my money
3535840	3537840	felt ourselves as welcome before.
3537840	3540840	I'm so happy I could cry.
3540840	3542840	Oh, and once you start crying,
3542840	3544840	you just want to go on.
3544840	3545840	Not again.
3545840	3547840	Please don't be unhappy at Jane.
3547840	3548840	Don't cry.
3548840	3549840	Dear.
3549840	3550840	Oh, dear.
3550840	3552840	Mom and Papa.
3552840	3554840	Mom and Papa.
3554840	3555840	Yes, Aunt Jane.
3555840	3556840	What is it?
3556840	3558840	I'll put some of my gold in a bank,
3558840	3561840	but you must look after the rest when I'm too old.
3561840	3563840	Oh, hmm.
3563840	3565840	And why not?
3565840	3566840	All right.
3566840	3567840	We'll keep it in the cellar
3567840	3570840	and make a nice little niche for it with seashells and moss.
3570840	3573840	And I'll have someone go down and look at it every week.
3573840	3574840	Don't you worry, Aunt Jane.
3574840	3576840	Your money will be in safe hands.
3576840	3578840	Not quite, but I had in mind.
3578840	3579840	I know.
3579840	3582840	But I suppose it can't be helped.
3582840	3584840	It sounds rather nice.
3584840	3586840	A cozy little niche down in the cellar.
3586840	3588840	And if you take a look every week,
3588840	3592840	but oh, dear, it will miss me.
3592840	3593840	Oh, Aunt Jane.
3593840	3594840	Very well.
3594840	3596840	I have made up my mind.
3596840	3598840	I'm leaving this sink.
3598840	3599840	It's with you now.
3599840	3602840	So you and my gold can get sturdy used to each other.
3602840	3603840	Do what you want with it.
3603840	3606840	Your friends seem to have ideas about how to spend it.
3606840	3609840	Flying ships and botanical research sound rather splendid.
3609840	3612840	Oh, dear.
3612840	3615840	I'm so happy for you.
3615840	3616840	Darn.
3616840	3619840	I should have let us up better than flowers.
3624840	3627840	So ended the visit of the dreaded Aunt Jane.
3627840	3632840	And I'm sure Sniff will be able to think of some other use for the gold.
3632840	3641840	They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.
3641840	3649840	You're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
3649840	3653840	They're always happy and goes at play.
3653840	3657840	The movements are having fun day after day.
3657840	3660840	The movements.
3660840	3664840	The movements.
3664840	3670840	The movements.
3691840	3696840	Here they are for one and all.
3696840	3699840	The movements are about to come.
3699840	3702840	Come on and sit down here with me.
3702840	3704840	They're here for you on your TV.
3704840	3707840	They are the movements.
3707840	3710840	They are the movements.
3710840	3713840	So come with me, give me your hand.
3713840	3716840	I'll take you up to a movement land.
3716840	3719840	You can fly just like a bird.
3719840	3721840	Sing that song ever!
3721840	3725840	There were the movements.
3725840	3728840	There were the movements.
3728840	3731840	There were the movements.
3731840	3733840	There were the movements.
3733840	3736840	There were the movements.
3736840	3742840	There were the movements.
3749840	3763840	One day in Newman Valley, not long before mid-summer on a perfectly ordinary day, Snuffkin suddenly announced that he was going on a short trip.
3763840	3766840	Where are you going, Snuffkin?
3766840	3771840	Well, not very far. I'll be back right after mid-summer.
3771840	3775840	Oh, but Snuffkin, you'll miss the bonfire at the big party.
3775840	3778840	But why in the world are you going away?
3778840	3783840	There's something I've been dying to do for a long time, and it has to be done on mid-summer eve.
3783840	3790840	I promise to tell you all about it, Moonman, as soon as I'm back in Moonman Valley.
3790840	3800840	Little did Snuffkin know that before he came back, the underwater volcano, which had kept quiet ever since Moonman Papa's youth, would wake up again.
3808840	3818840	What's all that smoke? Is it the volcano and your father's memoirs?
3818840	3825840	I don't think I like this.
3825840	3829840	I think it's exciting. In that case, you can have it.
3829840	3831840	Moonman Mama.
3831840	3833840	Yes, what is it, dear?
3833840	3837840	This hammock is shaking. It's very unpleasant.
3837840	3840840	I think it's that volcano you told us about.
3840840	3842840	Yes, I guess it must be.
3842840	3844840	Mama! Papa!
3844840	3845840	Oh!
3845840	3848840	There's smoke rising from the sea, Papa!
3848840	3850840	Smoke!
3850840	3852840	Oh, that's very odd.
3852840	3862840	What is it, Papa?
3863840	3865840	Let me see!
3865840	3869840	What's going on?
3869840	3873840	I don't know, really. I guess there isn't much we can do.
3873840	3875840	I can't see.
3875840	3878840	Where is it?
3878840	3880840	Let me see now. It's my turn.
3880840	3882840	No, I'm at first.
3882840	3884840	Yes, no, I've got it.
3884840	3886840	Oh, I'm clean. Let me see.
3886840	3889840	No, I'm at first.
3889840	3892840	Moonman Papa, will the Earth quakes as big in your youth?
3892840	3895840	No, they certainly weren't. And this one's underwater.
3895840	3898840	Oh, my net cause a tide of waves?
3898840	3902840	A tide of waves, oh my goodness, I've never thought of that.
3902840	3904840	Hey, what's your turn?
3904840	3907840	Snatch me the net.
3907840	3911840	What do you think? Can you see anything unusual, Moonman Papa?
3911840	3915840	I've never seen anything like it. This is very unusual.
3915840	3918840	Oh my, I want to see it too.
3918840	3921840	How can you bite during a catastrophe?
3921840	3925840	Whatever you do, don't rip the top off with you.
3935840	3938840	You're so stupid, you should have let me have it first.
3938840	3941840	It's all your fault little my, anyone can see that.
3941840	3943840	How dare you say it was all my fault.
3944840	3946840	Oh.
3950840	3952840	Snork maiden?
3952840	3953840	Yes.
3953840	3957840	I'm standing watch over my flying ship, so why don't you stay over in Moomin House?
3957840	3959840	You'd be careful.
3959840	3961840	You look after her, won't you, Moonman Papa?
3961840	3964840	Certainly, Snork. I don't like the look of things.
3964840	3968840	No, do I. No, do I. We better get inside, Moonman, house quickly.
3968840	3970840	Yes.
3970840	3973840	It's scary.
3973840	3976840	Yeah, the earthquake started.
4000840	4003840	The earthquake started.
4031840	4033840	Oh.
4053840	4056840	What's that noise? Listen, can you hear?
4057840	4059840	A noise? What noise?
4059840	4062840	I don't know. It sounds like water to me.
4065840	4067840	Oh no!
4067840	4071840	What's happened, Moomin House is drifted off to sea.
4073840	4076840	I don't believe this.
4077840	4081840	I think Moomin Valley is flooded. It really is.
4082840	4087840	What's happened to the kitchen and dining room?
4087840	4089840	Just because I fear.
4089840	4091840	What are we going to do?
4091840	4094840	Moomin Mama can't even prepare breakfast down there.
4094840	4097840	Oh, good morning. You're up early today.
4097840	4099840	Mama, Moomin House is flooded.
4099840	4101840	All of Moonman Valley is under water.
4101840	4104840	Oh, dear. I think you're right, Moomin.
4104840	4106840	It's Papa's still asleep.
4106840	4109840	Let's go and wake him up. He definitely wouldn't want missed it.
4110840	4112840	Boy, I'm sleepy.
4112840	4114840	I'm even asleep here.
4114840	4116840	I didn't sleep a wink because he was snoring.
4116840	4119840	Little my was snoring so hard the whole bed was shaking.
4119840	4122840	I'm going to have a nap as soon as I've had something to eat.
4122840	4124840	Hey, snap.
4124840	4128840	What's this? Where am I? What's happened here?
4128840	4131840	Moomin House is flooded, sniff.
4131840	4134840	This means I'll have to swim to get home.
4134840	4137840	You'll have to dive to get into your house.
4137840	4140840	Unless I'm mistaken, the water is still rising.
4140840	4144840	Moomin Papa, you've got to do something. Do something right away.
4144840	4147840	I think you better start taking swimming lessons.
4147840	4150840	And don't worry, sniff. I'll start organizing.
4150840	4152840	What do you want to organize, Moomin Mama?
4152840	4155840	Well, dear, I guess we should have some breakfast first of all.
4155840	4156840	Yes.
4156840	4159840	But how do we get into the kitchen, Papa?
4159840	4162840	You just leave that to me.
4163840	4167840	There, your kitchen.
4167840	4170840	I've never seen it from above before.
4170840	4172840	Oh, my goodness.
4172840	4176840	People should look at their rooms from above once in a while.
4176840	4180840	Look, cars of food floating from the cellar.
4180840	4183840	What luck we have a trap door.
4183840	4185840	Mama, shall I dive in and get them?
4185840	4186840	Yes, please, Moomin.
4186840	4190840	Be careful, Moomin. It's got to be done.
4191840	4194840	Hurry up, Moomin. I'm hungry.
4209840	4212840	Could you get us some bowls and plates this time?
4212840	4213840	Sure.
4221840	4224840	And indeed, the water was still rising.
4224840	4227840	It's coming. It's coming. Help!
4229840	4231840	The water's up to the third floor.
4231840	4234840	What are we going to do, Moomin, Papa? Where's Moomin, Papa?
4234840	4237840	He's up on the roof, sniff, with the others.
4237840	4239840	What are they doing up on the roof?
4239840	4241840	Ah, there goes another poorly built house.
4241840	4244840	Why doesn't our house float away, Papa?
4244840	4247840	It's all very simple, dear son. I've built it myself.
4247840	4250840	If you hadn't, maybe we wouldn't be about to sink altogether.
4250840	4252840	Here we are.
4252840	4255840	Are you coming to help me, everybody?
4256840	4261840	This is one of Grandma's best plates, so please be extra careful.
4261840	4265840	I know. But where do you think we're going, Mama?
4265840	4270840	Something will float by. Big enough to take all of us. We just have to wait.
4270840	4274840	I'm not going to wait for that. I think this family's out in touch with reality.
4274840	4277840	Something big enough will float by indeed, huh?
4277840	4280840	I'm going to sink my old skin while I'm still tired.
4282840	4286840	This is something I should have done immediately, but it's not too late.
4288840	4291840	Look, there's a whole house drifting by.
4291840	4295840	Oh, you're right. It's very odd looking house, though.
4295840	4298840	Yes, it does look funny, but I think we'd better take it.
4298840	4302840	Hmm. That's the one we're getting.
4302840	4305840	Somebody help me!
4305840	4308840	Wait, stop! I'm coming with you!
4308840	4311840	Don't leave me behind!
4314840	4316840	Where's that house?
4316840	4319840	Right over there. Just there. Can't you see it, Snapp?
4319840	4323840	Oh, that house. What? You call that a house?
4333840	4335840	Come on.
4338840	4341840	Hurry up, Snapp. What are you doing?
4341840	4344840	I just changed my mind. That one looks like it's going to sink.
4344840	4347840	No, it's fine. We're all aboard. Come on.
4347840	4351840	I don't believe you. As soon as I'm aboard, it'll sink. I can feel it.
4351840	4355840	He's scared of his own shadow. Let's leave him. Move any such a whimp.
4355840	4357840	Come on. It's all right.
4357840	4361840	Now, don't worry about me. You can let go of the ladder. I'm fine.
4361840	4366840	Stay behind if you like, Snapp. But what about your breakfast?
4366840	4372840	We have all the food here, and you might get hungry, and if you do, there'll be nothing to eat.
4372840	4375840	Why didn't you say so before?
4375840	4380840	Now, hold the ladder, Snapp. I don't want to be abandoned.
4380840	4386840	No, brother. He's kind of making you know what it is that he actually ever followed.
4387840	4391840	Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm falling off your back.
4391840	4394840	I'm falling. Don't do the same after all.
4394840	4396840	Don't shake it.
4396840	4399840	Don't shake it. Hold the steady.
4402840	4406840	Excuse us. Hello, anybody home.
4406840	4408840	Don't worry. We're not dangerous.
4408840	4412840	You isn't breakfast ready yet. I'm starving to death.
4412840	4414840	There's no one here, Papa.
4414840	4417840	I think you're right. It certainly seems empty.
4417840	4421840	Oh, and the most exciting empty house I've ever seen.
4421840	4428840	Why do you say that? What do you mean exciting? Do you mean interesting or do you mean scary little my?
4428840	4432840	Interesting and scary. Look, Snorgmaiden. Look around.
4432840	4435840	Oh, what a lot of mirrors.
4435840	4438840	This house must have been full of women who loved clothes.
4438840	4443840	Or maybe just one woman Snorgmaiden who had as many faces as there are mirrors in this room.
4443840	4447840	I don't like that. Look, every mirror has a chair in front of it.
4447840	4449840	Place just like so.
4449840	4452840	This house was full of ladies and he chatted her a little mirror.
4460840	4463840	Thank goodness we brought some plates with us.
4463840	4468840	Woman, woman, woman. Look what I found. Bread and apples.
4468840	4471840	How nice, sniff. Now we can have a real breakfast.
4472840	4474840	But where is everybody?
4474840	4478840	Well, I don't know. Somewhere around.
4482840	4485840	Whoever lived here must have had a lot of strange hobbies.
4485840	4488840	You're so right.
4488840	4490840	Hey, who said that?
4490840	4495840	Wow, look at that cog wheel. This snork would love that.
4495840	4498840	I wonder what woman will say about this little my?
4498840	4503840	I'm sure he'll say you look better without anything.
4503840	4506840	One look at you and he won't even notice anything else.
4506840	4510840	Well, if he has any sense, he will fall for me like a ton of bricks.
4510840	4513840	You want about breakfast, woman, mama?
4513840	4516840	We'll have breakfast as soon as we are all here.
4516840	4518840	I wonder where they can all be.
4518840	4522840	You know, it's very bad for me to go hungry. I always feel unwell if I don't eat.
4522840	4527840	All right, sniff. You go ahead. But mind you don't eat all the apples.
4527840	4529840	Leave some for the others, won't you?
4529840	4532840	Oh, don't worry. Of course I will, mom and mama.
4540840	4542840	This is an apple.
4542840	4545840	Oh, but where on earth did you find them, sniff?
4545840	4547840	In a football.
4547840	4550840	But normal trick to play on people making false fruit.
4550840	4552840	I'm very upset.
4552840	4555840	Oh, this is not bread.
4555840	4557840	Oh.
4561840	4564840	Who could have done such a cruel thing to me?
4564840	4567840	Somebody with a very art sense of humor, I'd say.
4567840	4569840	Somebody without anything.
4569840	4573840	Have some cheese instead. That at least comes from moving valley.
4573840	4576840	And it looks delicious.
4578840	4580840	Whatever these levers for.
4584840	4588840	What's that hear you sound? It's creepy.
4588840	4591840	Can't you hear it? It sounds like a new earthquake.
4591840	4593840	Yes, I can hear it.
4593840	4598840	It's scary and spooky and creepy. All you have to try to be on my mind.
4598840	4602840	Oh, I wonder what it can be. It's very strange indeed.
4602840	4605840	I just don't think I can take another earthquake right now.
4605840	4610840	Oh, my goodness. Oh, look. What is it, sniff?
4610840	4612840	Last moment, mama.
4612840	4615840	Why? Our table is gone.
4615840	4618840	This is a haunted mansion, mom and mama.
4618840	4622840	Well, they can't take grandma's plates just like that.
4622840	4625840	You can have the plates back, but I'll keep the cheese.
4625840	4627840	I like cheese.
4627840	4630840	This is good cheese, dad.
4631840	4633840	Yes, I certainly did.
4633840	4635840	Better not let our food out of sight.
4635840	4638840	Let's get out of this house, please, mom and mama.
4638840	4640840	What's this?
4640840	4642840	What's happening?
4644840	4646840	Oh, we'll have to get out of here.
4646840	4647840	What?
4647840	4648840	What?
4648840	4649840	What?
4649840	4650840	What?
4650840	4651840	What?
4651840	4652840	What?
4657840	4659840	What?
4659840	4661840	What?
4672840	4675840	Papa, was it the witch who was laughing?
4675840	4676840	No.
4676840	4679840	The laughter is coming from that ugly one.
4680840	4682840	Be behind there.
4689840	4692840	Did I hear someone call me an ugly thing just now?
4692840	4694840	Oh, excuse us, madam.
4694840	4696840	You must be the owner of this house.
4696840	4697840	No.
4697840	4698840	Oh?
4698840	4700840	Indeed I am not.
4700840	4701840	Most certainly not.
4701840	4702840	You are greatly mistaken.
4702840	4705840	This is no house you fool. This is a theater.
4705840	4706840	A theater?
4706840	4707840	Yes.
4707840	4710840	This is a stage where the heroin receives a standing ovation
4710840	4712840	at the end of the last act.
4712840	4714840	And the bread and the apples are props.
4714840	4717840	And the rumour you are playing is where the actors make themselves
4717840	4719840	up to become totally different people.
4719840	4721840	Kings are murderers.
4721840	4723840	Oh, and you are one of these actors?
4723840	4725840	An actress.
4725840	4727840	You understand less than nothing.
4727840	4729840	See this brum here?
4729840	4731840	This is my only prop.
4731840	4733840	I sweep the dust in this theater.
4733840	4734840	Oh, really?
4734840	4737840	I have wielded this brum for nearly 20 years.
4737840	4739840	Would nobody to help me?
4739840	4742840	20 years I have cleaned this theater beautifully.
4742840	4744840	My name is Emma.
4744840	4745840	Emma?
4746840	4747840	And you?
4747840	4750840	You better remember that this is at the theater.
4750840	4752840	This is no ordinary house.
4752840	4755840	And it is a great honor for you to be here at all.
4755840	4756840	That's true.
4756840	4759840	Does this mean that we can stay here just for a while?
4759840	4761840	Yes, until the actors return.
4761840	4764840	Today they all came to a low-verset.
4764840	4766840	Wow!
4766840	4768840	That's really cool.
4768840	4769840	Yes, it certainly is.
4769840	4771840	We'll try not to bother you, Emma.
4775840	4777840	Hey you!
4777840	4779840	Come on, get in the way!
4779840	4781840	Get out, get in the way!
4781840	4783840	Get in the way!
4783840	4785840	Get in the way!
4785840	4787840	You're white.
4787840	4789840	Woohoo!
4789840	4791840	Woohoo!
4791840	4793840	Woohoo!
4793840	4795840	Woohoo!
4795840	4796840	Oh!
4796840	4798840	Woohoo!
4798840	4799840	Woah.
4799840	4801840	Well, what have you done?
4801840	4805540	We seem to have hit a tree, so the house has stopped.
4805540	4808640	This is a theater not a house!
4808640	4811040	Oh, it's a Rowan tree.
4811040	4815540	How lovely it looks, how nice to have crashed into such a beautiful tree.
4815540	4817140	It's gorgeous!
4817140	4818740	And that smell.
4818740	4819740	You know what?
4819740	4822740	I'd like to spend the night in that great idea, Moon.
4822740	4825240	I'm coming with you, how exciting!
4825240	4829240	You better stay here, you're bound to fall into the water.
4830040	4831040	Look who's talking!
4831040	4832440	Scary cat!
4832440	4833740	That looks safe.
4833740	4835540	We could easily spend the night here.
4835540	4839640	We better tie the theater to the tree, so it won't drift away.
4839640	4841640	If that's all right with Emma.
4841640	4845040	Emma, is it all right to tie the theater to the tree?
4845040	4849140	Do what you want, as long as you don't damage the theater to get here?
4849140	4850140	All right.
4851640	4853840	Don't whistle, you idiot!
4853840	4856040	Don't ever whistle in a theater!
4856040	4858240	That's the worst luck possible!
4858340	4860340	How dare you!
4860340	4861340	Oh!
4874140	4876140	This is great snorkemaiden.
4876140	4877840	We can look at the moon.
4877840	4880140	And the flowers, they smell so good.
4882740	4884140	What's the matter?
4884140	4886140	I hope that snorke's all right.
4886140	4887240	Don't you worry.
4887240	4891340	He was standing guard over a flying ship after all.
4891340	4894340	All you have to do is get on board and fly away.
4918240	4920240	What's going on here?
4922240	4923240	Huh?
4924240	4925240	Hmm.
4926240	4927240	Ah!
4927240	4929240	No, they're trying to destroy the pamphor's box.
4929240	4931240	I've never seen anything like it!
4931240	4934240	These people are bunch of vandals!
4934240	4935240	Ugh!
4947240	4948240	Ugh!
4958240	4964240	Meanwhile, movement and snorkemaiden are fast asleep, blissfully unaware of what was happening.
4964240	4968240	But whatever will they do, stranded on the treetop.
4968240	4980240	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
4980240	4988240	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
4988240	4992240	They're always happy and goes at play.
4992240	4995240	The movements are having fun day after day.
4995240	4998240	The movements.
4999240	5002240	The movements.
5003240	5007240	The movements.
5022240	5034240	Here they are for one and all.
5034240	5037240	The movements are about to come.
5037240	5040240	Come on and sit down here with me.
5040240	5043240	They're here for you on your TV.
5043240	5045240	They are the movements.
5045240	5048240	They are the movements.
5049240	5052240	So come with me, give me your hand.
5052240	5055240	I'll take you up to a movement land.
5055240	5058240	You can fly just like a bird.
5058240	5060240	Sing that song ever.
5060240	5063240	There were the movements.
5063240	5066240	There were the movements.
5066240	5069240	There were the movements.
5069240	5072240	There were the movements.
5072240	5075240	There were the movements.
5075240	5079240	There were the movements.
5079240	5082240	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
5094240	5099240	Women and snorknaten were still fast asleep in the row and tree.
5099240	5104240	The sun was high in the sky and the floating theater had floated away a long time ago.
5105240	5107240	Oh, I feel so good.
5107240	5110240	I really slept like a log all night.
5110240	5116240	It's so lovely to be out in the fresh air with moon and a tree in blue.
5116240	5120240	No! No!
5120240	5122240	The house is gone!
5122240	5125240	I mean, the theater is gone!
5125240	5128240	What?
5128240	5131240	No! The house is gone!
5131240	5134240	I mean, the theater is gone!
5134240	5136240	Moomin!
5136240	5138240	Wake up, Moomin! Wake up!
5138240	5140240	There's been a catastrophe! Wake up!
5140240	5142240	What's a catastrophe?
5142240	5143240	Look down!
5143240	5146240	The theaters floated off during the night.
5146240	5149240	I don't believe it.
5158240	5159240	It has!
5159240	5160240	It's gone!
5160240	5162240	I can't see it anywhere.
5162240	5165240	It must be far away by now.
5165240	5167240	Moomin, your father's walking stick!
5167240	5170240	Huh?
5170240	5175240	It must have gotten loose in the middle of the night while everybody was asleep.
5179240	5182240	Crying won't solve the problems don't made him.
5182240	5187240	But we're stranded in the row and tree with water all around us.
5188240	5190240	No!
5211240	5213240	We're floating away!
5213240	5215240	We're drifting away!
5217240	5218240	Oh!
5218240	5220240	What are we going to do?
5220240	5224240	Moomin and Snorkmaiden are still up in that beautiful row and tree.
5224240	5226240	That's just typical.
5226240	5227240	Where is it?
5227240	5229240	And how can we have drifted so far away?
5229240	5231240	He was the last night, didn't you?
5231240	5235240	I told you never to do that in a theater and brings bad luck.
5235240	5238240	Oh, never.
5238240	5240240	What?
5240240	5243240	Oh!
5244240	5245240	No!
5245240	5246240	Stop it!
5246240	5247240	Backer to heaven!
5247240	5249240	Let's go upstairs!
5249240	5250240	Stop it!
5250240	5251240	Oh!
5251240	5252240	Oh!
5252240	5254240	Little Mai!
5254240	5257240	Oh, no!
5257240	5258240	Oh, no!
5258240	5259240	That was me!
5259240	5260240	Oh, dear!
5260240	5262240	Oh, little Mai!
5262240	5264240	Oh, get this hurry!
5264240	5266240	You're so mean!
5266240	5269240	Little Mai is drifting off!
5269240	5272240	Scenes were stranded and that's not a bad thing.
5272240	5274240	There shouldn't swim about like that.
5274240	5284240	I'm too scared to get over to your side!
5284240	5286240	You must be brave, Snorkmaiden!
5286240	5289240	I'll catch you so you won't fall, okay?
5289240	5299240	I told you so, the branch didn't break, did it?
5299240	5301240	Thank you for saving me!
5301240	5302240	Ah!
5302240	5303240	Ah!
5303240	5304240	Ah!
5304240	5305240	Ah!
5305240	5306240	Ah!
5306240	5307240	Ah!
5307240	5308240	Ah!
5308240	5310240	Are you all right, Newman?
5310240	5312240	I can stand up, Snorkmaiden!
5312240	5314240	Look, the water's only ankle deep!
5314240	5315240	Really?
5315240	5316240	Ah!
5316240	5317240	Ah!
5317240	5318240	Ah!
5318240	5319240	Ah!
5319240	5320240	Ah!
5320240	5323240	Are you all right, Snorkmaiden?
5323240	5325240	Yes, it's so shallow!
5325240	5332240	I wonder where I'm going to end up.
5332240	5335240	It doesn't matter, I rather like this boat.
5335240	5336240	I'm going to make some noise.
5336240	5339240	I'll go back to sleep for a while.
5345240	5348240	It's getting dark, isn't it?
5348240	5349240	Oh?
5349240	5355240	Yes, dry land!
5355240	5357240	Look there!
5357240	5358240	A fire!
5358240	5360240	Must be people over there.
5360240	5361240	Yes!
5361240	5379240	Of course, I've forgotten tonight's mid-summer eve!
5392240	5393240	What?
5404240	5406240	What a strange catch!
5412240	5414240	So the movements have split up.
5414240	5416240	Are they in trouble, little Mai?
5416240	5419240	Yeah, seems I was probably the luckiest one as usual.
5420240	5421240	Mark!
5421240	5424240	I'm sorry you can't have anymore, that's all I have.
5424240	5427240	I don't believe you, your bag's still full.
5427240	5429240	Yes, but not with food, little Mai.
5429240	5431240	What's in it then?
5431240	5433240	You'll soon find out.
5436240	5437240	Where are we going?
5437240	5438240	To a park.
5438240	5440240	I hope there's a hot dog stand there.
5450240	5452240	Those two over there are the park keeper and his wife.
5452240	5454240	Look, they're always watching.
5454240	5458240	They guard a lot of poor orphans who come to the park every day.
5458240	5459240	Really?
5459240	5460240	Look over there!
5464240	5465240	Unbelievable!
5480240	5482240	Hey, what's this?
5491240	5492240	Hey kids!
5493240	5495240	Come on everybody, we're here to let you out.
5495240	5497240	Come quickly, hurry!
5497240	5498240	What?
5498240	5500240	We can't go anywhere.
5500240	5502240	We have to sit right here so they can see us.
5502240	5505240	Yeah, otherwise they might lose one of us.
5505240	5508240	What a lot of signs, no walking on grass.
5509240	5511240	No shouting, no running.
5511240	5513240	What a lot of rules.
5513240	5515240	What are they good for, Snuffkin?
5515240	5516240	Nothing.
5516240	5517240	Nothing at all.
5517240	5519240	And that's why we're going to pull them up.
5519240	5521240	No, you mustn't.
5521240	5523240	I don't think one is allowed to do that.
5523240	5525240	And you have to walk on the grass.
5525240	5526240	Yes indeed.
5526240	5528240	And I really like walking on the grass.
5528240	5529240	I always have.
5531240	5532240	No buts.
5532240	5534240	Come on everybody, let's make a start.
5539240	5542240	That looks like fun, I'll pull some too.
5544240	5546240	What are you doing?
5546240	5547240	Can't you read?
5547240	5550240	There's a sign saying it's forbidden to pull a charge.
5550240	5551240	This one?
5551240	5552240	Yeah!
5552240	5553240	Oh, oh!
5553240	5554240	Sorry!
5554240	5555240	Oh!
5555240	5556240	Oh!
5556240	5557240	Oh!
5557240	5558240	Oh!
5558240	5560240	Oh!
5560240	5561240	Oh!
5561240	5563240	Oh!
5563240	5564240	Oh!
5564240	5566240	I'm beautiful sign!
5566240	5567240	Bye bye!
5567240	5568240	Bye bye!
5568240	5569240	Oh!
5569240	5570240	Oh!
5570240	5571240	Oh!
5571240	5573240	There you free!
5573240	5574240	Go run!
5574240	5575240	Okay!
5579240	5580240	Stop!
5580240	5581240	Wait!
5581240	5582240	Oh!
5585240	5587240	What an awesome pose!
5587240	5588240	My goodness!
5589240	5591240	Those little balls are shining!
5593240	5594240	Oh!
5594240	5595240	Oh!
5595240	5596240	Oh!
5596240	5597240	Oh!
5597240	5598240	Oh!
5598240	5599240	Oh!
5599240	5600240	Oh!
5600240	5601240	Quick, Brian!
5601240	5602240	Those were howdy fat receipts!
5602240	5604240	Come on everybody, run!
5608240	5609240	Oh!
5609240	5610240	Oh!
5610240	5611240	Get out of here!
5611240	5613240	Someone help!
5613240	5615240	Someone help!
5615240	5617240	The rest of me!
5617240	5618240	Get down!
5618240	5619240	Get away!
5619240	5620240	Quick!
5620240	5622240	That's terrible!
5625240	5628240	Where could that floating theater have gone?
5629240	5631240	They're still following us!
5634240	5637240	Come on you kids, you can go wherever you want!
5637240	5639240	Do what you like!
5639240	5641240	Yeah, but I don't know what I want!
5641240	5642240	Me neither!
5642240	5643240	Me!
5643240	5645240	I think they want to go with you, Snuffkin!
5645240	5648240	But I don't know anything about small children!
5648240	5650240	I'm not sure I even like them!
5650240	5652240	All we have to do is find a theater!
5652240	5654240	Moonman Mama will know what to do!
5654240	5656240	In that case, let's go!
5677240	5678240	A house!
5678240	5679240	Yes and look!
5679240	5681240	All the lights are on!
5681240	5683240	Maybe they're celebrating with some relief!
5683240	5685240	Shall we go there?
5685240	5686240	Yes!
5698240	5699240	Oh!
5699240	5700240	Ah!
5702240	5703240	At last!
5703240	5704240	Oh!
5704240	5705240	Hello!
5705240	5707240	Happy midsummer!
5707240	5708240	Thank you!
5708240	5710240	Happy midsummer!
5710240	5712240	What can I do for you?
5712240	5715240	Would you have seen a theater drifting around somewhere, ma'am?
5715240	5716240	A theater?
5716240	5720240	Yes, you see a drifted away in the flood, and my powers are on it!
5720240	5722240	Oh dear, I haven't seen anything like that!
5722240	5724240	Oh, what a pity!
5724240	5726240	Thank you! We'll look elsewhere!
5726240	5728240	Have a nice midsummer party!
5728240	5729240	Party?
5729240	5732240	Oh yes, a party! Thank you very much!
5732240	5735240	Very well then, I'll say goodnight!
5736240	5739240	Did we say something wrong, Momen?
5739240	5741240	I don't know.
5751240	5753240	What's the matter?
5753240	5755240	I think she's crying.
5755240	5757240	Oh!
5757240	5758240	Hello!
5758240	5760240	Is there anything we can do, anything at all?
5760240	5762240	Aren't you having a party, ma'am?
5762240	5766240	No, unfortunately, she's not coming this year either.
5766240	5767240	Oh is she?
5767240	5769240	My aunt, my father's side.
5769240	5773240	I invite her every year for a midsummer party, but she never comes.
5773240	5776240	How sad! You must be very fond of her!
5776240	5779240	Oh no! She's an awful person!
5779240	5783240	If that's how you feel about her, why don't you invite someone else?
5783240	5785240	She's my only relative!
5785240	5788240	So invite someone who isn't a relative?
5788240	5791240	Yes, why don't you invite us, for instance?
5791240	5793240	Oh!
5793240	5795240	Can one really do things like that?
5795240	5796240	Just like that?
5796240	5798240	Of course one can!
5798240	5800240	Oh, how marvelous!
5800240	5803240	To be perfectly honest, we're very hungry!
5803240	5806240	I've made lots of extra pancakes.
5806240	5808240	Please come in and join me.
5808240	5810240	Thank you!
5810240	5815240	Although we have drifted apart tonight, is midsummer's eve?
5815240	5820240	Let's drink a toast to Momen, Snork Maiden, and Little Mai, and hope that they're safe.
5820240	5823240	You better drink to that no-good niece of mine, I guess.
5823240	5824240	Who's that, Emma?
5824240	5826240	My only relative.
5826240	5829240	She lives all alone in a small house by the sea.
5829240	5831240	Oh, is she all alone for midsummer?
5831240	5834240	Probably. I always invite me over for pancakes.
5834240	5839240	I don't like relatives, and I don't like pancakes, and she's boring, so I don't go.
5839240	5844240	Well, let's toast her anyway, and here's hoping we'll all be together again very soon.
5844240	5846240	Cheers!
5846240	5848240	Good health!
5851240	5854240	Oh, that was really good. Everything was delicious.
5854240	5856240	I think I've eaten too much.
5856240	5859240	Oh, please have some more. Oh, this is so nice.
5859240	5861240	I couldn't eat another thing.
5861240	5864240	Oh, sad. It's such fun having someone to cook for.
5864240	5867240	I'm so pleased you're not at my door.
5867240	5869240	All that's missing now is a bonfire.
5869240	5872240	We always have one on midsummer eve.
5872240	5876240	What a good idea. Let's have one.
5876240	5878240	Over there.
5881240	5883240	Help! Help!
5883240	5885240	Help! Help!
5885240	5887240	So glad you came.
5889240	5891240	See these? The flood brought all of them.
5891240	5895240	They were lying all over the place, so I tied them into one big pile.
5895240	5897240	Would they make a good bonfire?
5897240	5899240	Oh, a terrific one.
5899240	5901240	Definitely.
5911240	5913240	Oh, wow!
5928240	5932240	We've walked for miles, but I can't see signs of a theater anywhere.
5932240	5935240	Oh, don't worry. We'll find it soon.
5935240	5938240	Huh? And what's the matter with you?
5938240	5940240	I'm hungry. Me too.
5940240	5941240	And me.
5941240	5943240	I can't walk anymore.
5943240	5947240	We don't have any food. If you want food, you'll have to look for it yourself.
5950240	5952240	Oh, don't cry.
5952240	5954240	Look over there, little lion.
5954240	5955240	What?
5955240	5957240	Over there, hidden behind the trees.
5957240	5958240	Whoa, I have.
5958240	5959240	And the lights are on.
5959240	5961240	We're safe.
5969240	5973240	Hey, kids, you can't go eating other people's food.
5973240	5977240	You can if they are home, and it's just what's left over from a party.
5977240	5979240	In fact, I will have some myself.
5979240	5981240	It's amazing. I'm always so glad.
5981240	5982240	Oh.
5987240	5990240	Hey, kids, you can't go eating other people's food.
5990240	5994240	You can if they are home, and it's just what's left over from a party.
5994240	5996240	In fact, I will have some myself.
5996240	5998240	It's amazing. I'm always so glad.
6004240	6007240	Now we must pick nine flowers.
6007240	6009240	Why is that Snorke maiden?
6009240	6012240	I don't really know. It's always nine or seven of something.
6012240	6014240	Okay, nine flowers.
6015240	6019240	No, not the same kind. You must pick nine different flowers.
6019240	6021240	And then what do you do?
6021240	6024240	You turn around seven times like this.
6026240	6028240	I get it.
6041240	6046240	And then you walk backward until you reach a well.
6046240	6050240	And then when you look down into the well,
6050240	6054240	there you'll see the man you're going to marry.
6054240	6056240	How do you get him up?
6056240	6059240	I think I see him. What a clever well.
6059240	6061240	That I must try.
6075240	6077240	I'd like someone more romantic.
6077240	6078240	Got you.
6078240	6080240	What are you doing?
6080240	6082240	I'm quietly now.
6082240	6085240	All we did is pick some unprotected well flowers.
6085240	6087240	I know what you did.
6087240	6089240	Hey, Snorke maiden.
6089240	6090240	Moon.
6090240	6093240	Ha, you know each other. That makes it conspiracy.
6093240	6096240	But I tell you, we've done nothing wrong, nothing at all.
6096240	6098240	We were only celebrating.
6098240	6099240	Better for you, if you haven't.
6099240	6102240	But why? Can't you light a bonfire here, sir?
6102240	6106240	I must warn you that all you say will be used against you.
6106240	6109240	I have a complaint from the parkkeeper.
6109240	6112240	You pulled up these signs from his park and you burnt them.
6112240	6113240	That's not true.
6113240	6115240	It is true that we burnt them, sir,
6115240	6117240	but we didn't take them from any park.
6117240	6119240	They were brought here by the flood.
6119240	6121240	Older-dash, here's the evidence.
6121240	6122240	Oh.
6122240	6125240	I've caught you when that's that.
6131240	6134240	Oh, I caught something.
6134240	6136240	Oh, it's just a piece of wood.
6136240	6138240	Had any ideas yet?
6138240	6140240	Not a single one. How about you, mama?
6140240	6142240	Same here, I'm afraid.
6142240	6145240	I just can't seem to think of anything at all.
6152240	6155240	You wouldn't have any ideas about what we should do next.
6155240	6156240	Would you, Emma?
6156240	6157240	About what?
6157240	6161240	Some ideas about how to let the children know where we are, of course.
6161240	6165240	How does anyone know where a theater is?
6165240	6167240	I don't know.
6167240	6168240	Please tell us.
6168240	6170240	Well, you put on a play.
6170240	6171240	A play?
6171240	6173240	Yes, that is correct.
6173240	6174240	This is a theater.
6174240	6177240	And when you put on a new play, everybody comes flocking to see it.
6177240	6180240	They come to laugh, to cry, to shout, and to applaud.
6180240	6183240	And when your children hear of it, they will be hearing a flash.
6183240	6185240	What a splendid idea, Emma.
6185240	6188240	That's exactly what we'll do.
6188240	6191240	Hmm, I'm sorry. We can't put on a play.
6191240	6193240	Why not?
6193240	6197240	We have no actors. They are pests, but one can't do without them.
6197240	6199240	I can be one.
6199240	6201240	And I'm also quite good at acting.
6201240	6203240	I can act very well.
6203240	6207240	There are only three of you and not one of you is an experienced professional actor.
6207240	6210240	Don't forget, we have you, Emma.
6210240	6211240	Me?
6211240	6217240	Well, I've always felt that I would make a rather good Shakespearean heroine.
6217240	6221240	And we can each have many parts, as long as they're not all on the stage at the same time.
6221240	6223240	He isn't at so moment, Papa.
6223240	6225240	Of course, it's possible to do it.
6225240	6227240	I want the part that finds the treasure.
6227240	6230240	No, that's impossible. We have no play.
6230240	6233240	Nothing simple enough for the likes of you.
6233240	6236240	A moment, Papa, can write one. He's very talented.
6236240	6240240	No trouble at all, my dear. Any number of acts.
6240240	6242240	But we don't want any number. We want three acts.
6242240	6245240	That's what all proper plays always have, moment, Papa.
6245240	6247240	Let's start right away.
6247240	6249240	We gotta print posters.
6249240	6250240	And clean the stage.
6250240	6252240	Whatever, if I started.
6252240	6254240	Aw.
6254240	6260240	And this was how Woman Papa got started on a short career as a playwright.
6280240	6292240	But while the birds carry news of the play far and wide,
6292240	6298240	what has to become of Woman and Snork Maiden?
6298240	6302240	Their troubles are real ones.
6311240	6318240	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
6318240	6326240	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
6326240	6330240	They're always happy and goes at play.
6330240	6337240	The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.
6337240	6341240	The movements.
6341240	6347240	The movements.
6367240	6375240	Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come.
6375240	6378240	Come on and sit down here with me.
6378240	6383240	They're here for you on your TV. They are the movements.
6383240	6386240	They are the movements.
6386240	6390240	So come with me, give me your hand.
6390240	6393240	I'll take you up to a movement land.
6393240	6398240	You can fly just like a bird and sing that song ever.
6398240	6401240	There were the movements.
6401240	6405240	There were the movements.
6405240	6410240	There were the movements.
6410240	6413240	There were the movements.
6413240	6416240	There were the movements.
6416240	6417760	About our brain.
6422880	6426800	All over Blüven Valley, bits of paper were fluttering down.
6427280	6431680	No, we're so weak, are you still going?
6432880	6435040	They were even falling over the lake.
6440080	6442480	What's this? Oh, litter.
6442480	6446480	There's some writing on that piece of paper. I think it's a message.
6446480	6449480	Hmm, hmm. Let's see.
6449480	6453480	Moomin' theatre presents written by Moomin' Papa.
6453480	6454480	Moomin' Papa.
6454480	6457480	The last children of Moomin' Valley.
6457480	6462480	Starring Moomin' Papa, Moomin' Mama, and Sniff and introducing Emma.
6462480	6466480	Emma? I'm sure that's my ad. She works in a theatre.
6466480	6470480	Admission fee? Anything edible?
6471480	6475480	They're putting on a play. So they can't be lost.
6475480	6479480	Hmm. I haven't seen a play since I was a kid.
6479480	6485480	It was wonderful. The best play ever. All about a princess.
6485480	6489480	She fell asleep in a rose bush. She was so lovely.
6489480	6494480	I've got to see that one again. But who will guard my prisoners, I wonder?
6494480	6499480	I'm a good idea, officer. You could take the three of us with you to the theatre to see the play.
6499480	6504480	Good idea. We love the theatre, so we won't try to run away, officer. I promise.
6504480	6509480	Hmm. That's possible. I won't let you out of this jail until you write out.
6509480	6516480	It's forbidden to burn signs 5,000 times each. That's the punishment for vandals.
6516480	6519480	Well, in that case, you won't be able to see the play.
6519480	6524480	Ah, who cares? Oh, whoa. Yes, I must see it. I must go.
6524480	6527480	So you'll take us with you? No, you stay right here.
6527480	6530480	Well, then you can't go either, officer.
6530480	6532480	Quiet. You're upsetting me.
6532480	6536480	No, no. This isn't good enough. It's not true drama.
6536480	6541480	Ah, please, woman, papa. I don't want to be just a lion's ugly behind.
6541480	6543480	But, sniff, I did give you another part.
6543480	6545480	I don't want to be a baby either.
6545480	6551480	And she said you wanted parts without lines. Could you do the dusting a bit later, Emma, please?
6551480	6556480	His script should be ready now. We have to start practicing for the opening night tomorrow morning.
6557480	6559480	Don't worry, Emma. It's coming along.
6559480	6563480	I'm only half done. I shall never get ready in time, woman, mama.
6563480	6567480	You're right to worry. For the curtain will rise tomorrow, no matter what.
6569480	6573480	Women papa will remember to give Emma lots and lots of lines.
6573480	6576480	She's really looking forward to her first performance.
6576480	6580480	All right. Now, leave me. I must be left alone to concentrate.
6580480	6583480	The writer needs peace and quiet.
6583480	6586480	There are some things I don't like about this script.
6586480	6590480	I'll discuss it with you after the performance, sniff, after.
6590480	6595480	If it's a story about lost children, why do you have to have a stupid lion?
6595480	6598480	I'm too good an actor to be cast as a lion.
6598480	6602480	I'll keep them out of my hair when India is giving me a headache.
6602480	6605480	You come with me, sniff. We'll practice our parts.
6605480	6609480	This could be a wonderful play if you'd only skip the lions behind.
6609480	6612480	I've heard enough about this behind.
6612480	6617480	Remember, we have a lion's head, too, dying to show his acting skills on the stage.
6617480	6621480	This is my play, and I refuse to write out the lion's butt.
6621480	6624480	I refuse.
6626480	6630480	Here is the key. I want you to keep a keen eye on them until I come back.
6630480	6632480	Do you understand me, cousin?
6632480	6634480	Are they very dangerous?
6634480	6637480	Yes, they certainly are. They bite if you let them out.
6637480	6638480	Okay?
6638480	6640480	We certainly wouldn't bite anyone, obviously.
6640480	6644480	I've had enough of your lies. Don't listen to my dear cousin. They do.
6644480	6648480	Well, then, now I'm up to the theater to see the play.
6648480	6651480	Take good care of them while I'm gone.
6663480	6666480	Excuse me. You seem to be a very good knitter.
6667480	6669480	Oh, thank you.
6669480	6672480	Nobody ever said that to me before. I enjoy it.
6672480	6674480	What are you making?
6674480	6678480	I'm not sure. I don't really know. Nothing in particular.
6678480	6682480	It's just that knitting is so reassuring somehow.
6682480	6685480	Nothing bad can happen while you knit, can it?
6685480	6691480	The trouble is I always seem to forget to decide what to make before I start.
6691480	6695480	But it feels nice and warm, and I love the color.
6695480	6698480	Can you make socks? It's a very nice sock color.
6698480	6700480	Socks?
6700480	6703480	Yes, it's very, very cold in here.
6703480	6707480	Oh, yes. That's a very good idea.
6707480	6712480	Listen, if I knitted each one of you a pair of warm socks,
6712480	6715480	would you really put them on? Of course!
6715480	6718480	That would be nice. I'm almost freezing to death in here.
6718480	6720480	It's so very, very cold.
6720480	6722480	Is it really that cold?
6722480	6727480	Yes, my teeth are chattering, so I could hardly talk, honestly.
6727480	6732480	Oh, dear, oh dear. What should I do?
6732480	6737480	Maybe some steaming hot black currant juice would help to warm us up a little.
6737480	6741480	Possibly, although it might already be too late.
6753480	6761480	My cousin would be very angry with me if he knew, but I think...
6761480	6762480	But you think what?
6762480	6766480	I think I'll let you out so that we can all be nice and warm indoors.
6766480	6767480	Really?
6767480	6770480	Wait, wait, wait.
6770480	6773480	Don't cry now, baby.
6773480	6777480	There's a good boy. Don't cry, honey.
6777480	6779480	That's enough, baby.
6783480	6786480	Whoa!
6786480	6790480	Oh, woman mama, you need to show much more emotion.
6790480	6793480	Try to be more motherly and more loving.
6793480	6796480	Listen, dear. This is a very heavy baby.
6796480	6798480	How am I doing, woman papa?
6798480	6802480	You're just perfect for the part sniffing your performance was excellent.
6804480	6807480	Maybe I should add a part with some lines in it.
6813480	6823480	Look at these. I think they might be ready by now.
6823480	6827480	I hope they're tasty. They don't always come out very well.
6827480	6830480	You're so kind. We've had so much already.
6830480	6832480	But they smell really delicious.
6832480	6833480	They sure do.
6833480	6836480	Thank you so much. Now I feel warm again.
6836480	6838480	How about some more black currant juice?
6838480	6840480	Or maybe one of these freshly baked cookies?
6841480	6843480	It's very kind of you, but no thank you.
6843480	6846480	I couldn't eat another thing. I'm so full up.
6846480	6848480	Me too.
6848480	6851480	Oh dear, the party is over then.
6851480	6854480	I'm afraid so.
6854480	6857480	It's really sad, but I have to lock you up again.
6857480	6859480	But at least I know you're warm in there.
6859480	6864480	We're real sorry too, but you don't need to worry because actually we're not going back to jail.
6864480	6866480	Oh, aren't you?
6866480	6870480	We've got other plans. We're going to the theater. Just see my parents play.
6870480	6874480	And I suppose I should say hello to my Aunt Emma, who works there.
6874480	6879480	Oh, what shall I do? My cousin will be very cross with me.
6879480	6883480	But you see, we're innocent. We didn't do anything wrong.
6883480	6884480	You didn't?
6884480	6886480	I swear it.
6886480	6889480	Do I look like someone who pulls up signs in a park?
6889480	6892480	We just burned some flocks and left by the flood.
6892480	6894480	But your cousin wouldn't believe it.
6894480	6898480	He's a conclusions, wrongful arrest. That's all it was.
6898480	6902480	Oh dear, why didn't you tell me that it once?
6902480	6906480	People shouldn't go to jail when they haven't done anything wrong.
6906480	6908480	So we can go to the theaters, that okay?
6908480	6910480	Of course, better leave right away.
6910480	6914480	My cousin will be fairly disappointed, but I guess I can't be helped.
6914480	6916480	Wait for me.
6916480	6923480	I think I'd better come along and explain to that cousin of mine that his three prisoners are innocent of the charge against them.
6924480	6930480	All right, all right, bring it in. That's right, Mom.
6930480	6932480	Papa, stop there.
6932480	6933480	Okay, sniff.
6933480	6935480	Mom and Mama, what have you got there?
6935480	6940480	A baby's crib. I want to use this in the play. If that's all right with you.
6940480	6942480	Mom and Papa, Mom and Papa.
6942480	6946480	I've just read your script and I think you have a big problem.
6946480	6950480	Who is going to pay the parts of Mom and Snork Maiden in this play of yours?
6950480	6955480	I don't know yet. We don't have any more children and Sniff can't take the part.
6955480	6962480	Are you utterly mad? We only have a few hours before the curtain goes up and you don't even have actors for all the part.
6962480	6963480	What kind of director is that?
6963480	6967480	Maybe one of us could stand behind something and sort of read their lines.
6967480	6971480	Wait, thank you, us. I give up. Let's hope the credits are proud.
6976480	6978480	Hold on tight, all of you.
6978480	6988480	Listen kids, you can be as noisy as you like out here but once we're at the dinner you have to be quiet.
6988480	6990480	You understand me right?
7009480	7011480	The audience is waiting for us. Come.
7026480	7032480	Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for giving up your valuable time in order to come to our show tonight.
7032480	7039480	The world premiere of the lost children. This is a brand new company and the players never been performed before.
7039480	7043480	Ladies and gentlemen, sit back and enjoy the superb acting.
7043480	7046480	What's that? A baby's cradle. It's for you, Sniff.
7046480	7047480	For me?
7047480	7051480	We sincerely hope you'll be thrilled by the originality of the plot.
7051480	7056480	And so now dear friends, let's get started. Let's get started.
7062480	7064480	Come on, come on.
7068480	7073480	There's a good boy. Don't cry, honey. Please don't cry.
7074480	7083480	Oh, moment, snorkemaid and my darling children. You've been lost for a whole month and we haven't heard a word from either of you.
7083480	7085480	Oh, he's forgotten all about me.
7086480	7092480	I'd give the whole world to be rid of this most terrible agonizing despair.
7092480	7099480	Oh, make your husband try not to fret so I'm sure he'll be back before very long.
7099480	7109480	Little children, come and free me from this plight. Your mother worries all day through the baby's awake all night. Come home, come home my children to.
7110480	7112480	With all our hearts, we're missing you.
7117480	7118480	Louder, Sniff.
7121480	7123480	But what's wrong with you, Sniff?
7123480	7125480	This rocket's making me sick.
7125480	7128480	Oh, dear, and right in the middle of movement, Papa's play.
7131480	7134480	Mama, let us set forth and find our loved one.
7134480	7136480	We cannot leave our baby here.
7137480	7140480	Oh, anyone would love to have him sweet little thing.
7140480	7143480	For how long, pray, do you think we would be gone?
7143480	7149480	For as long as it takes, I can no longer stand being this frightfully upset about my children.
7149480	7150480	Oh, baby!
7153480	7154480	Yeah.
7160480	7161480	Hurry up, Sniff.
7162480	7163480	I'm trying!
7164480	7167480	Hurry, scene two is about to start.
7167480	7170480	Help me somebody, I can't get out of here!
7170480	7172480	When do they put the princess on?
7172480	7174480	We still have very far to go.
7174480	7176480	I'm afraid so hurry, movement.
7176480	7177480	I am hurrying.
7177480	7178480	It's for bitten.
7178480	7179480	It's for bitten.
7179480	7180480	It's for bitten.
7180480	7181480	It's for bitten.
7181480	7182480	What are you writing on that, man?
7182480	7185480	My cousin won't give up, I'm sure.
7185480	7187480	So I better write this 5,000 times.
7187480	7188480	It's for bitten.
7188480	7189480	It's for bitten.
7189480	7190480	It's for bitten.
7190480	7192480	It's for bitten.
7194480	7196480	A full two weeks has passed.
7196480	7198480	Oh, what shall we do?
7198480	7202480	Our dear children have disappeared from the face of the earth.
7204480	7206480	Oh, what's happened, dear apple of my heart?
7206480	7209480	I think I sprained my hands really badly.
7209480	7210480	Oh, it hurts.
7210480	7214480	If you were in trouble, apart from the wolves, we're all alone.
7214480	7216480	I'll put you out.
7216480	7217480	Stop!
7217480	7218480	Stop!
7218480	7220480	Why must this happen in my theater?
7220480	7223480	I've been squeezed in here to make me look smaller.
7223480	7224480	Help!
7224480	7225480	I'm trying to.
7225480	7227480	We can't have the lion on stage without his behind.
7227480	7228480	Wow!
7228480	7229480	Whoa!
7229480	7230480	Whoa!
7230480	7231480	Oh, whoa!
7231480	7233480	Whoa!
7233480	7237480	We have to face the worst and spend the night right here in the wilderness.
7237480	7239480	Dear husband, will it be all right?
7239480	7243480	Fairly in these unhellowed woods, I feel quite queasy.
7244480	7249480	Sweet wife, I too can smell those frightful beasts howling for a blood.
7249480	7252480	May not just smell them, dear.
7252480	7254480	Anything that I can hear them now.
7256480	7260480	I can hear the howling of those hungry beasts.
7262480	7266480	Paint is the roar, but I can make it out a lion.
7266480	7268480	Whoa!
7268480	7269480	Whoa!
7273480	7275480	Oh, sniff, what's up?
7275480	7277480	Where are you going, dear?
7277480	7282480	Oh, listen, I have to go and stop that stupid lion
7282480	7286480	who's roaming around the countryside watching our every move.
7286480	7289480	Hey, don't worry, I'll be right back, my dear.
7289480	7292480	Was he supposed to say that?
7292480	7295480	Hey, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be on stage.
7295480	7297480	It's not my father stuck in his crib.
7298480	7301480	Moment, mama, stuck on stage. Roll a lion.
7303480	7306480	Ooh, that lion sounds very close.
7306480	7308480	My husband must be in great danger.
7308480	7310480	All right, under that stage, both of you.
7315480	7318480	Papa, I can't get this thing off, I feel sick.
7321480	7323480	What are you doing, moment, papa?
7323480	7325480	You can do it with a cradle on, sniff.
7325480	7327480	No, I can't. Stop it, please.
7327480	7328480	Don't do it, moment, papa.
7328480	7330480	They'll laugh at me out there.
7330480	7333480	Don't worry, nobody knows it's you hiding in there.
7333480	7335480	Come on now, hurry.
7339480	7342480	A lion, a lion is this to be my most untimely end?
7350480	7352480	Don't you dare laugh at me.
7356480	7360480	Whoa, is that lion gonna eat, moment, mama?
7362480	7364480	Oh, no, what might you do?
7364480	7366480	What should I do, moment, papa?
7366480	7368480	I'm scared, can't be bothered to do.
7368480	7371480	Let's run off across the stage, dear.
7371480	7373480	We were supposed to run off together.
7373480	7375480	Well, the situation has changed.
7375480	7378480	I'll have to come to your rescue some other time, dear.
7378480	7380480	Oh, help me.
7386480	7388480	Help me, please.
7388480	7390480	Please, hold out, everyone.
7390480	7392480	They got to really see it.
7401480	7402480	Help me, please.
7402480	7405480	Someone, come quickly before I get killed.
7405480	7406480	Oh.
7406480	7408480	Coming, moment, mama.
7408480	7410480	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
7419480	7421480	Oh, it's only snap.
7421480	7423480	Little Maya, I'm so glad you're all right.
7425480	7427480	Shirley, weren't worried about me, moment, mama.
7427480	7429480	Well, just a little, maybe.
7429480	7432480	But you're such a lucky girl, I knew you'd manage.
7432480	7433480	Mama, mama.
7433480	7435480	I don't believe it.
7435480	7437480	Mama, it's me, moment.
7437480	7439480	It's me, Snorkemaiden.
7439480	7441480	Mama, mama.
7441480	7443480	Moment, Snorkemaiden.
7443480	7445480	Is it really you?
7445480	7447480	Come here and let me see you.
7449480	7451480	We've come back, mama.
7451480	7453480	I was dying to see you.
7453480	7456480	Oh, it's wonderful to have you back.
7456480	7458480	Isn't that my niece?
7458480	7459480	And Emma.
7459480	7460480	Oh.
7460480	7463480	You look so grown up.
7464480	7466480	And Emma, so sorry to have missed your show,
7466480	7469480	but I have so much to tell you.
7470480	7471480	Hi, everybody.
7471480	7473480	That was a great performance.
7473480	7475480	Snorkemaiden, I'm so glad to see you.
7475480	7477480	Glad you're safe, moment.
7477480	7478480	Yay!
7478480	7480480	Yay!
7480480	7481480	Those are my prisoners.
7481480	7483480	They've escaped from jail.
7483480	7484480	Catch them.
7486480	7487480	No, cousin.
7487480	7490480	I let them out because they swear they're innocent.
7490480	7493480	They didn't pull up a single one of those signs.
7493480	7494480	That's right.
7494480	7496480	I was the one who did that deliberately.
7496480	7498480	And I helped him.
7498480	7499480	Very well.
7499480	7500480	You're both under arrest.
7500480	7502480	No, no, no!
7502480	7505480	We were these dreadful children.
7505480	7507480	Dear dear cousin.
7509480	7511480	It's forbidden.
7511480	7513480	Five thousand times. That's what you wanted.
7513480	7516480	And are you sure there are five thousand?
7516480	7519480	Oh, yes. Quite sure. I've counted them.
7519480	7522480	One, two, three, four.
7522480	7524480	Now that we are all together again,
7524480	7527480	I would really like to go back to Moomin Valley.
7527480	7529480	What shall we do with all these little pests?
7529480	7530480	Snuffkin.
7530480	7531480	Well, little Mai.
7531480	7533480	Someone might like to foster them.
7534480	7536480	You can leave them in my car, sir.
7536480	7538480	And yours, Emma?
7538480	7539480	Yes.
7539480	7541480	Now I have some acting experience.
7541480	7543480	I think I would like to start an acting school.
7543480	7545480	Exactly what this theater needs.
7545480	7546480	What a good idea.
7546480	7548480	Do you think I would be too old to attend?
7548480	7550480	Perhaps character parts.
7550480	7551480	Like in my play.
7551480	7553480	All is arranged for the best.
7553480	7554480	So now we can go home.
7554480	7557480	It is Moomin Papa. I think it's high time.
7557480	7560480	Quiet, please. I've lost my cup.
7560480	7563480	Now I'll have to start again right from the beginning.
7563480	7566480	Moomin Papa, do you think we should thank the audience
7566480	7569480	for their patience because they're still watching us, you know?
7570480	7572480	Oh, you're right.
7574480	7576480	Ladies and gentlemen, that's all for tonight.
7576480	7579480	I hope you have enjoyed the performance.
7579480	7583480	I think it was very kind of you to stay to the very end.
7595480	7599480	Sometimes I could almost believe the truth is strange to the fiction of it.
7599480	7602480	Well, it is, isn't it, Moomin Papa?
7602480	7604480	No, not really.
7604480	7606480	We writers are no better.
7606480	7608480	Go write more play.
7608480	7611480	Oh, what a very good idea, Moomin Papa.
7611480	7614480	I think you're as good with plays as you are with memoirs.
7614480	7615480	Are you too?
7615480	7619480	Right, I'll start on the sequel as soon as we're all back home.
7623480	7625480	There it is, I lovely home.
7625480	7627480	At least I got a proper wash.
7627480	7629480	I've never seen it so clean.
7629480	7630480	What about in sign?
7630480	7632480	Oh, redecorated, probably.
7632480	7633480	Yeah.
7633480	7634480	Let's go.
7634480	7638480	The Moomin family spent the whole of the following week
7638480	7640480	making their house cozy and comfortable.
7640480	7643480	And soon each carpet, each cup and saucer
7643480	7647480	and every piece of furniture was back in its proper place once again.
7664480	7668480	They're always happy and goes at play.
7668480	7672480	The Moons are having fun day after day.
7672480	7675480	The Moons.
7675480	7679480	The Moons.
7679480	7685480	The Moons.
7694480	7700480	The Moons.
7700480	7711480	Here they are for one and all.
7711480	7714480	The Moons are about to call.
7714480	7717480	Come on and sit down here with me.
7717480	7719480	They're here for you on your TV.
7719480	7722480	They are the Moons.
7722480	7725480	They are the Moons.
7725480	7728480	So come with me, give me your hand.
7728480	7731480	I'll take you up to a moment land.
7731480	7734480	You can fly just like a bird.
7734480	7736480	Sing that song ever.
7736480	7739480	There were the Moons.
7739480	7742480	There were the Moons.
7742480	7745480	There were the Moons.
7745480	7748480	There were the Moons.
7748480	7751480	There were the Moons.
7751480	7756480	There were the Moons.
7762480	7767480	One night, the moment was having a dream.
7767480	7771480	What a wonderful feeling to be flying like this.
7771480	7773480	Look over there, Moons.
7773480	7775480	What a beautiful lake.
7775480	7779480	This is one of the most fantastic experiences I've ever had.
7779480	7780480	Me too.
7780480	7783480	I never knew birds had such a marvelous life.
7783480	7787480	Seeing things from a completely different point of view.
7787480	7790480	We're flying pretty high aren't we?
7790480	7792480	I'm scared.
7792480	7794480	We're much too high.
7794480	7795480	Let's go down.
7795480	7798480	Please let's go down at once.
7798480	7802480	I'm not scared of heights.
7802480	7806480	Oh snort, this time you really have succeeded.
7806480	7810480	Will I could build hundreds of these if you wanted me to?
7810480	7813480	Snort, can I steer just for a little while?
7813480	7815480	Now you're here.
7815480	7817480	Oh, thank you.
7817480	7820480	Do you really know how to steer this thing?
7823480	7826480	Hey, stop it, stinky.
7826480	7829480	That's dangerous.
7837480	7839480	This is okay, really.
7839480	7841480	It's just a dream.
7860480	7863480	Oh gosh, my head hurts so.
7863480	7865480	What a strange dream.
7865480	7868480	Did my brother let stinky steer his flying ship?
7868480	7870480	Surely not.
7870480	7874480	I was talking to the snork while I looked away, suddenly stinky took his place.
7874480	7877480	Oh, and then the thing began tilting?
7877480	7879480	Hmm, but it was just a dream.
7879480	7881480	I don't care, I don't like it.
7881480	7885480	You shouldn't have dreams like that just when my brother's flying ship is almost ready.
7885480	7888480	Dreams often come true, you know.
7888480	7892480	But it was nothing like the ship your brother's building, it was totally different.
7892480	7894480	But tell me what happened to it in the end.
7894480	7896480	Did it fall down?
7896480	7900480	I don't know, I lost sight of it when I fell off and I didn't see it again.
7900480	7903480	Well, surely you could have turned your head to take a look.
7903480	7905480	Well, I didn't.
7905480	7909480	Listen, moment, don't say a word to the snork about this.
7909480	7911480	He's nervous enough as it is.
7911480	7912480	Of course not.
7912480	7914480	Why don't we just forget about it?
7914480	7916480	Pretend it never happened, eh?
7918480	7921480	Oh, snork, it's finally completed.
7921480	7924480	Sure it is, but it hasn't been flown yet, of course.
7924480	7928480	But it will, I won't snork, you don't think there's anything wrong with it?
7928480	7930480	Of course not, but it's just...
7930480	7932480	Is there some problem, snork?
7932480	7934480	Well, there might be.
7934480	7935480	So, what is it?
7935480	7936480	Fuel.
7936480	7937480	Fuel?
7937480	7941480	But you said you had developed a new fuel that was really good.
7941480	7946480	It's good, but you see, you see, it might not be powerful enough.
7946480	7949480	You mean it might not be able to fly?
7949480	7952480	No, it won't. You're quite right.
7952480	7956480	Or it will just be an ordinary ship, not a flying ship.
7956480	7960480	Oh, that would be nice. What can't go up can't possibly fall down.
7960480	7966480	But that's not the point if it won't fly. Everyone will laugh at me. I know they will.
7966480	7968480	I won't laugh, I promise.
7968480	7970480	Maybe not. Others will.
7970480	7975480	But you wouldn't care about that, would you? Who cares what other people think?
7975480	7980480	I've already told people that the test flight will be quite soon, in public.
7980480	7985480	But I'm sure people will be very nice about it, even if it doesn't get off the ground.
7985480	7988480	That's hardly what I want.
7988480	7994480	Moomin, I'd like to ask you a favor. That's why I sent for you. Will you help me?
7994480	7997480	I'll do anything you ask, snork, of course.
7997480	8001480	What I would like is for you, Moomin, my friend, to be test pilot for me tomorrow.
8001480	8004480	You want me to be a pilot?
8005480	8035480	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
8035480	8065480	Stinky, I'm going to steer that ship, is that perfectly clear? You're not to touch the wheel, I'm the pilot now. What on earth was that about? Wouldn't you find it difficult to steer it? Oh, no, it's real easy, but of course, I'd need to practice before the public demonstration. Is the snorke going to fly his own ship? He'll be there, but he has to stay down in the
8065480	8095480	engine room, snuff can. I wonder if this ship will really fly. The only problem is the fuel. Only the fuel you say. That's a big problem. I suppose so. Listen, woman, suppose now the snorke's flying ship really gets off the ground. Well, of course, it's going to, Papa. That something could happen, something could break or you could fall into an air pocket. It's such a dangerous undertaking. Think, woman. Papa!
8095480	8125480	Not natural for movements to fly about up in the air. Is it snuffkin? Quite right. What would you and the snorke do if things went wrong? We will be wearing parachutes, you know? Parachutes. You do know what they are, don't you, Papa? Of course I do. They come down from the sky like this, like this. Exactly, but of course, we won't need a parachute, because nothing will go wrong. And I will be the first flying ship pilot ever!
8125480	8155480	Oh. Hi there. Hello, my young man. Hello. How do you do? How do you do everybody? Hello, sir. I wonder if you can help me. Do you happen to know where the snorke's factory is? You mean the ship? I must see him. I'm most eager to have a look at his famous flying ship. How do you know about that? It's supposed to be very secret. The information must have leaked out somehow.
8155480	8185480	You inventors know about what he is trying to do. He's famous throughout Moomin Valley this snorke. Really? Are you an inventor, too? Indeed I am. One of the more famous. I think maybe the most famous of them all. I am Moomin Papa. How do you do, sir? I'm snuffkin. And my name is Moomin. Please to meet you. A very good day to you, one and all. The muffles, my name.
8185480	8215480	He said I'm the muffle. You mean you've never even heard of me the most famous inventor? Oh yes, I'm sure I am. The muffle, isn't it? Yes, it is the muffle. Have you invented anything exciting, muffle, Mr. Muffle? I would be much easier to tell you what I haven't invented, young man. For instance, the pin that can't prick because it has two heads. The newspaper that reads itself the purse that moans and groans if you take money from me.
8215480	8244480	The adhesive tape that sticks only to itself. This is perhaps the greatest of all my latest inventions. Whatever is that? This is proper self a man powered fan. Infanible in Moomin weather. All these are my latest inventions.
8244480	8262480	You didn't know that, did you? No, it isn't. But try and get a handkerchief, the square balloon, the five wheel car, the hexagonal frying pan, the seven hole button, and a host of others. Indeed, how interesting. What did you want to see the snorkel boat?
8262480	8281480	I thought I might be able to help him out with one of my inventions. That's what? Oh, Jill, which one? My new? No, it's very top secret stuff I can tell you. Now, where is the snorke's factory? I'll take you right there. Very kind of you. Come, he'll be so surprised.
8281480	8303480	Must be off. See you again. It's a pleasure to help these budding inventors. Snorkel be so excited. A famous inventor, eh? What is your opinion, snorke? Have you ever seen a triangular handkerchief, Moomin Papa? No, when I don't want to either. I do wonder what he's cooked up for the snorke, though. It is sort of intriguing. Yes, indeed.
8303480	8311480	Moomin will be able to tell us later, I suppose. Yes, but anything could happen before then. Can we wait that long snorke? You're right.
8315480	8327480	No, wait for me. I'm coming with you. Oh, I thought we had several guests. Now, where in the world are they all gone?
8333480	8335480	Hm?
8343480	8347480	Now, where are they off to, I wonder?
8353480	8355480	Oh, look who's coming!
8355480	8375480	What are you doing here? We're just interested. Where are the muffle and the snorke? The snorke and the muffle are discussing some top-secret project. It's very harsh. Not a triangular handkerchief, I hope.
8375480	8387480	I don't know, Papa. As I said, it's top-secret. Let's see. Oh, bother. The curtains in the way, so I can't see a thing.
8390480	8401480	So this is the powerful fuel you've developed, is it, Mr. Muffle? Yes, it is. Not as original as my other inventions, I admit. But very useful. Yes, useful. I call it super fuel.
8401480	8417480	Only trouble is my engine has been designed for liquid fuel. No problem at all, young man. If you dissolve this block of fuel in 10 liters of water, your engine will run for at least 10 hours. For 10 whole hours? That's incredible.
8417480	8431480	If you doubt the word of the muffle, then try it out and see for yourself right now. Right now? Better still, I guarantee that if used as it is in a solid state, your engine will run not for 10, but for 100 hours.
8431480	8440480	100 hours? But that's incredible. You really must be some inventor. Indeed, if what you say is true, it would solve the last problem of my flying ship.
8441480	8447480	Oh, now that I've looked more closely at the padlock, this store isn't locked. No, it isn't.
8449480	8455480	So if one wanted to see the snorke, one could walk right in. But why would you want to see him, Papa? Well...
8455480	8462480	Why don't you tell us? I don't want snorke falling for one of the muffles crazy ideas, that's why.
8462480	8468480	Well, we'll find out pretty soon. Maybe you don't realize it, but the snorke is pretty clever, you know.
8468480	8473480	I think I know exactly what they're doing in there. Yeah, what?
8475480	8481480	I saw that man pouring something into the flying ship. What was it? Well, I guess it must have been fuel, movement.
8481480	8487480	Well, how come you saw him? There's a crack that's just about wide enough for me, but I won't tell you where.
8487480	8492480	What are those two in there talking about? Oh, yeah, so this is the great super fuel.
8492480	8496480	Wait a minute, snorke, there must be something wrong with it. Yeah, you're right.
8496480	8503480	What the hell? There you are. Solid fuel indeed, huh? A hundred hours? You're an imposter, sir.
8503480	8513480	No, it isn't true, if you just let me explain. No, thank you. I know very well why you came over here with that ridiculous story, off with you right now.
8513480	8520480	Listen to me. It is not ridiculous, and it is not just a story. Maybe we shouldn't have dissolved it in the water.
8520480	8529480	That was a mistake. Imposter? But I'm the muffler. I don't care. Maybe it's just a misunderstanding, and the fuel isn't suited for flying ships.
8529480	8536480	Wrong, it suits everything. Forget the fuel. That was just a trick so he could come here and get to see my flying ship.
8536480	8541480	So the muffler has come here to spy, man. Ridiculous. I don't steal.
8541480	8544480	Papa, was there anything you wanted to see me about?
8544480	8551480	Eh? No, I just dropped by. No cause for excitement. The fuels are done.
8551480	8556480	No, it's not. That's not true. I don't invent guns. What would be the point of inventing them?
8556480	8560480	Oh, listen to me, please. Let's try and use the fuel once more.
8560480	8566480	No, thanks. Once was once too many. I'll have to clean my tanks from your gunge. Get out of my sight.
8571480	8581480	Oh dear, this must have been a bit of a disappointment for the snork. I know.
8581480	8594480	Now listen, stinky. I'm doing this for the snorksake, isn't that so?
8594480	8599480	I don't care if you're doing it for all I want is to get a good look at the famous flying ship.
8599480	8606480	You'd need something very powerful to get a thing like that off the ground. Something so powerful that only I, the muffler, could ever have invented it.
8606480	8610480	Remind me one day to show you my famous triangular handkerchief.
8610480	8615480	Now all we have to do is not dissolve the fuel in water but use the solid fuel.
8615480	8619480	Hurry up with that lock, stinky, or maybe I should invent a lock pick.
8619480	8623480	Come on, stinky. Hurry, hurry.
8624480	8625480	There you are done.
8625480	8627480	Good, come. We don't have much time.
8627480	8638480	No, I'm dying to steer this ship.
8638480	8643480	Oh, stinky, stinky. We're flying at a height of just over 2,000 meters now.
8643480	8645480	Stinky! Yeah, I'm listening. What is it?
8645480	8650480	When you hear me say now, that's when I want you to start off the engine immediately.
8650480	8653480	All right, no problem. I guess it must be this one.
8653480	8655480	No, no, not yet. This is it.
8655480	8660480	Just a drop of water on the fuel block. Now that should do it.
8660480	8665480	Can I start it now? Not yet. All right.
8668480	8674480	Now, start off the engine stinky. Die, answer.
8674480	8678480	Did you really turn on the switch? Yes, I did.
8678480	8682480	The engine won't start. Are you quite sure you turned the one I pointed out to you?
8682480	8686480	I think so. Maybe I turned the wrong one.
8686480	8688480	Outside these two is where I'll come on.
8688480	8693480	Stinky, this is no joke. My reputation as a famous inventor is at stake.
8693480	8696480	These two do it, I think. Is that work, Mr. Mapple?
8696480	8701480	Nothing is happening. I knew I shouldn't have let you do it better to do it myself.
8701480	8703480	You're useless. Wait, Mr. Mapple.
8703480	8706480	I haven't tried the very last one in the row. This one switched late.
8706480	8711480	What? I better throw that one too. You never know. It might just do the trick.
8719480	8723480	It works. It works. I know it works. I know it works.
8723480	8725480	It is working.
8726480	8731480	I'm not surprised, but I'm so pleased with myself.
8731480	8737480	You should be here, Snork. This is my great moment. You should be here to share it with me.
8737480	8741480	Come on, I can't wait to try this thing.
8744480	8748480	Incredible. This ship's arrived.
8748480	8751480	This is one of my desert inventions.
8751480	8754480	Ha, ha, ha!
8757480	8761480	Pass! Pass! Pass!
8761480	8763480	Pass!
8767480	8770480	Pass! Pass!
8770480	8773480	Pass!
8781480	8785480	Come on, let me go! Come on!
8786480	8792480	What's your power? I don't think the engine has started up.
8792480	8796480	I'm very much afraid it's exploding.
8796480	8799480	Hey, stinky engines exploding.
8799480	8801480	Where are you going?
8801480	8805480	It's going to explode any minute by wonderful invention.
8805480	8806480	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
8835480	8865480	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh electrodes. Now, come to your nice room on the small side, but the very best one. That explosion, it really was most unexpected, officer. Everybody knows you're a great inventor. I wonder if you could help me, Mr. muffel. Look how? Could you think of something to protect my roses while you're staying with us? An-an explosive, of course.
8865480	8866480	Of course I couldn't.
8866480	8868480	Piece of cake, officer.
8870480	8872480	Oh, I really did want to fly.
8874480	8877480	Come, come now, cheer up, snorke dear.
8877480	8880480	Here you are, a nice cup of tea.
8880480	8881480	Thanks.
8884480	8888480	It's very strange, but I had a dream the other night about a flying ship.
8888480	8891480	Did you really move in? That sounds very interesting.
8891480	8893480	Yes, very interesting.
8893480	8895480	Moment, tell me about it.
8895480	8901480	Yes, it was a peculiar looking ship totally different from your flying ship, snorke.
8901480	8903480	Different? Oh.
8903480	8907480	Well, it was sort of round like this.
8907480	8911480	It had a propeller and something hanging underneath.
8911480	8914480	And we flew over a high mountain.
8914480	8916480	Round?
8916480	8917480	Yes.
8917480	8920480	And you were in a sort of thing hanging underneath.
8920480	8921480	Yes.
8921480	8923480	Round?
8923480	8925480	Round, huh?
8925480	8927480	Round?
8929480	8931480	What ever is the matter, snorke?
8931480	8932480	What?
8932480	8934480	Oh, mama, thanks for the tea.
8934480	8936480	I think I'm getting a new idea.
8936480	8938480	Moment, see you later.
8938480	8940480	Papa, I must go.
8940480	8942480	Oh, there he goes again.
8942480	8944480	I know that, look, mama.
8944480	8948480	You won't get an intelligent answer out of him for the next month or so, honestly.
8948480	8950480	I'm very happy for him.
8950480	8954480	I must say that was a very clever dream you had, moment.
8954480	8956480	I'm a better inventor than the model.
8956480	8960480	You deserve a triangular acruchy.
8962480	8965480	So the explosion didn't distress the snort for long.
8965480	8969480	Soon he was back at his favorite occupation, planning.
8969480	8971480	But planning what?
8971480	8973480	Rome?
8979480	8981480	Rome?
8981480	8985480	Yes.
8985480	8988480	Rome?
8988480	8995480	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
8995480	9003480	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
9003480	9006480	They're always happy and go as it played.
9006480	9010480	The movements are having fun day after day.
9010480	9013480	The movements.
9013480	9017480	The movements.
9017480	9023480	The movements.
9033480	9050480	Here they are for one and all.
9050480	9053480	The movements are about to come.
9053480	9056480	Come on and sit down here with me.
9056480	9058480	They're for you on your TV.
9058480	9061480	They are the movements.
9061480	9064480	They are the movements.
9064480	9067480	So come with me, give me your hand.
9067480	9070480	I'll take you up to a moment land.
9070480	9073480	You can fly just like a bird.
9073480	9075480	Sing that song ever.
9075480	9078480	There were the movements.
9078480	9081480	There were the movements.
9081480	9084480	There were the movements.
9084480	9087480	There were the movements.
9087480	9090480	There were the movements.
9090480	9095480	There were the movements.
9095480	9100480	There were the movements.
9100480	9103480	There were the movements.
9103480	9111480	There were the movements.
9111480	9114480	When the Henry first told movement about the golden fish,
9114480	9119480	the woman thought to himself that it must look something like that.
9119480	9128480	My grandpa told me that his mother had actually seen it.
9128480	9130480	So you never saw it yourself, Mr. Hamlin?
9130480	9132480	No, I'm a botanist.
9132480	9136480	It comes to the surface only under very special conditions.
9136480	9138480	It's very rarely seen.
9138480	9139480	Conditions?
9139480	9140480	Yes.
9140480	9143480	First of all, it must be right between summer and autumn.
9143480	9145480	But that's now.
9146480	9149480	It has to be in the afternoon sunshine after heavy rain.
9149480	9151480	Yes, that does narrow it down.
9151480	9153480	And there must be no wind.
9153480	9156480	Grandpa said not even a ripple on the water.
9156480	9157480	Oh dear.
9157480	9162480	And there are some other conditions that he really didn't know about anyway to see it.
9162480	9164480	You must be extremely lucky.
9166480	9169480	Hmm, just getting to the lake itself isn't too easy.
9169480	9172480	It's way beyond lonely mountains.
9173480	9178480	Going over lonely mountains and back would take at least two days.
9178480	9181480	Not really, because I know a shortcut movement.
9181480	9183480	I could take you there and back in one day.
9183480	9185480	Oh, could you do that?
9185480	9186480	Yes.
9186480	9188480	Have you already been there, Snuffkin?
9188480	9190480	Just once.
9190480	9192480	Oh, will you show me the way?
9192480	9193480	You really want to go?
9193480	9194480	Yes.
9194480	9198480	I must see that golden fish with my own eyes and maybe capture it.
9198480	9200480	It won't be easy to capture.
9201480	9202480	Why not?
9202480	9205480	From what I've heard, the golden fish is far too clever to get caught.
9205480	9208480	I know, but it would be so much fun.
9208480	9209480	You going alone?
9209480	9212480	Well, Snorkmaiden said she wanted to come along.
9212480	9214480	She gets these ideas, you know.
9214480	9215480	Just Snorkmaiden?
9215480	9216480	Uh, maybe little Mai.
9216480	9217480	What about Sniff?
9217480	9220480	I think he wants to come along too.
9220480	9221480	What would you?
9222480	9225480	In that case, we'd better go across the mountains.
9225480	9226480	Why is that?
9226480	9227480	Why can't we take the shortcut?
9228480	9231480	The path is rather steep and dangerous, you know, Moomin.
9231480	9233480	Especially in the forest of witches.
9233480	9234480	Hi, the witches?
9234480	9235480	Not now, maybe.
9235480	9237480	Oh, so it's safe then.
9237480	9241480	But it's a very deep forest dark and scary even in daytime.
9244480	9246480	That's okay. We'll take the shortcut.
9258480	9259480	Oh, dear.
9277480	9278480	So long.
9278480	9288480	Good morning, Snuffkin!
9300480	9303480	Sorry, Snuffkin. Guess I overslept.
9303480	9306480	Snortmaiden, a little my auntie, yet.
9306480	9308480	You're very early.
9308480	9312480	I dreamt I caught the golden fish, and then, of course, I couldn't go back to sleep.
9312480	9314480	Well, let's go.
9314480	9316480	Shouldn't we wait for Snortmaiden and little my?
9316480	9319480	Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?
9319480	9323480	And anyway, didn't we decide that we wouldn't wait for anybody?
9323480	9325480	So it might be better this way.
9325480	9327480	What's better this way, woman?
9327480	9329480	Oh, little my!
9329480	9331480	Why don't you stay here?
9331480	9333480	This will be a very tough expedition.
9333480	9335480	I'm tougher than you.
9335480	9337480	Wait for me!
9343480	9345480	Hey, walk any faster, Snuffkin.
9345480	9347480	I'm still so sleepy.
9349480	9351480	Why did we have to leave so early, moving?
9351480	9353480	To get there, back in a day, Snortmaiden.
9353480	9355480	But we aren't taking the shortcut, are we?
9355480	9358480	Yes, but it still might get dark before we're back.
9358480	9361480	I won't be able to walk back this fast, you know,
9361480	9364480	because my bucket will be full of water for the golden fish.
9364480	9367480	Well, don't be disappointed if you don't catch it.
9367480	9369480	But that's my whole reason for going!
9369480	9371480	But you heard what the Himmelin said, Snuff?
9371480	9375480	We'll be extremely lucky to even catch sight of the golden fish.
9375480	9377480	I heard him, and now's exactly the right time.
9377480	9380480	Maybe the others made too much noise.
9380480	9382480	We'll just have to wait and see.
9382480	9385480	Don't you worry, I'll catch him all right.
9395480	9396480	Where are they?
9396480	9398480	We're going sorely in the morning.
9401480	9403480	How far is the forest of witches?
9403480	9405480	I'd say about two hours.
9405480	9410480	And can you also tell us how long from one end of the forest to the other, Snuffkin?
9410480	9412480	About the same.
9415480	9417480	Are there really such things as witches?
9417480	9418480	No.
9418480	9420480	Baby, because I'm not a bit scared of them.
9420480	9421480	Aren't you?
9421480	9423480	Not the least little bit.
9423480	9424480	There used to be some, though.
9424480	9425480	What, witches?
9425480	9426480	Well, of course, Snuff.
9426480	9429480	What else do you think that they call it the forest of witches, huh?
9429480	9433480	And you're absolutely sure that there are no witches now.
9433480	9435480	I haven't heard of any coming back.
9436480	9440480	So you're not absolutely sure that there are no witches.
9447480	9449480	Where's Moomeyerner still in bed?
9449480	9452480	He was off before you woke up, Papa.
9453480	9456480	Oh, the golden fish.
9456480	9458480	Good morning, dear.
9458480	9460480	I wanted to go with them.
9460480	9463480	But you're writing your memoirs you're far too busy.
9463480	9467480	And that's very true with the sort of a fish that no one has seen.
9467480	9470480	That might have been a whole chapter.
9470480	9472480	Do you think they'll catch it?
9472480	9475480	No, I doubt it very much. It's highly unlikely.
9475480	9477480	In that case, you should have gone with them.
9477480	9480480	No, I do know a thing or two bad fishing.
9480480	9483480	Snuffkin does, too, but he's still so young.
9483480	9486480	Oh, don't worry, I'm sure Snuffkin will manage.
9487480	9490480	Oh, this is a spooky forest.
9490480	9492480	Maybe the witch is every time.
9492480	9494480	Stop it, little mind.
9494480	9496480	Listen, everybody. Don't stray away from me.
9496480	9498480	Promise you might get lost.
9510480	9512480	Oh, it's so dark in here.
9512480	9516480	Sure, isn't so thick the sun can't get through.
9518480	9520480	That's because of those clouds.
9540480	9542480	I can hear the wind.
9542480	9544480	But we need calm.
9544480	9546480	Yeah, but we also need heavy rain.
9546480	9548480	You're right, that's what the Hemiellin said.
9548480	9550480	It sure looks like rain.
9550480	9552480	Not only looks like...
9554480	9556480	Oh, it's raining.
9571480	9572480	Here.
9572480	9574480	Oh, thank you.
9578480	9580480	I gotta say this rainstorm was very sudden.
9580480	9582480	Don't worry, it won't last that long.
9582480	9584480	How do you know that?
9584480	9586480	Vagabons do.
9586480	9588480	This rain isn't that heavy.
9588480	9590480	No, it's not bad, but we better hurryer.
9590480	9594480	We won't get to the lake till noon, and that'll be too late.
9594480	9597480	I don't think we'll get very wet down here, Mum.
9597480	9599480	And so why don't we move on?
9599480	9601480	I'm excited.
9601480	9603480	What should we do, it's nothing.
9603480	9605480	Well, we could move on, couldn't we?
9605480	9607480	Yeah.
9613480	9615480	Yeah!
9623480	9625480	We really are getting too wet.
9625480	9627480	We better find some shelter quickly.
9627480	9629480	But where can we shelter?
9629480	9631480	There's nothing in this wood-except tree.
9631480	9633480	On your tree, then, I guess.
9633480	9635480	Yeah!
9635480	9637480	What is it, Snorke, Nathan?
9637480	9639480	There's a house over there.
9645480	9647480	It's falling to wreck and ruin.
9647480	9649480	Well, at least it'll keep the rain off.
9657480	9659480	Yeah!
9667480	9669480	Hello there!
9669480	9671480	Anyone home?
9671480	9673480	There's nobody here.
9683480	9686480	No one's lived here for a long time.
9686480	9690480	I wonder who could have been who lived here all alone.
9700480	9702480	I know who it was.
9702480	9704480	And so do we all.
9704480	9706480	Surely you don't mean.
9706480	9708480	The Witches, of course.
9708480	9714480	Look around for dried spices, magic herbs, brums, sticks, and a black cat.
9714480	9716480	A niren pot.
9716480	9718480	A pile.
9718480	9720480	But no, bro.
9720480	9722480	No, the Witch rode away on it.
9726480	9728480	There's someone here.
9728480	9730480	Who is it?
9736480	9738480	Let's get out of here.
9738480	9740480	Came from over there.
9744480	9746480	No, don't.
9746480	9748480	That's okay, Snorke.
9748480	9750480	We gotta get out of this place.
9760480	9762480	Oh, I can't move, Snorke, Nathan.
9762480	9764480	Stinky?
9768480	9770480	Pretty good.
9770480	9772480	I bet you were really scared.
9772480	9776480	It's very rude of sniff to faint when he hears my voice.
9776480	9780480	Where are you off to anyway?
9780480	9782480	Oh, come on, tell me.
9782480	9784480	Can't you even take a joke?
9784480	9786480	Come on, wait for me.
9786480	9788480	Okay.
9800480	9802480	That way.
9802480	9804480	Okay.
9804480	9806480	Come on.
9816480	9844200	This is it isn't it yes it is where's the golden fish I really don't know I've never seen it either
9844200	9852640	with rain sunshine and calm I'm sure all the fish will come the golden fish help me catch it I just got to have that golden fish
9852640	9882040	oh it's deep down in here somewhere I can't see any fish anywhere
9882040	9895120	maybe it was a very funny joke the hamula doesn't show let's sit down and wait I'm sure the golden fish will appear for us I don't believe it do me
9895120	9902040	to say you came all this way here just to see some stupid old fish I came to catch it well that's even more stupid
9902040	9915600	they stopped making those ripples so they really got excited and walked all the way you say oh to be young again well I would have gone
9915600	9922680	with them if I hadn't over slept I didn't know that you were that young woman Papa I'm not exactly old you know
9922680	9929880	pretty interesting to see a fish that hardly anyone's ever seen sniff said that he would catch this
9929880	9937200	golden fish if it's the last thing he did oh well he had a net and a very large bucket to carry at home
9937200	9946800	and that's a good one what do you mean I guess I must have forgotten to tell you all the details there's
9946800	9957000	so much you don't know about this fish
9957000	9966000	the hamula was certainly right hardly anyone has seen this golden fish and we're not gonna see it either
9966000	9975360	maybe somebody ate him years ago stinky be quiet please did you see it where did you see it
9975360	9985240	huh I saw a fish jump but I couldn't tell if it was golden it was much too far away with the sun over
9985240	9992120	there we just see the outlines norc maiden yes we couldn't really see the color look everybody look I can see
9992120	10000520	your raft over there hey let's take it and go on to the middle of the lake but it's much too small for all of us
10000520	10010600	don't worry sniff this won't sink I'm staying you do what you like but you'll never catch any fish if
10010600	10018880	you're afraid of water stinky you can help me it's gold you know we can sell it for a lot of money
10018880	10036320	and then we'll both be very wealthy I think it was somewhere around here wasn't it or unless I
10036320	10045960	suppose hard to say well I can't see anything I did see there's certainly no sign of it now well we'll
10045960	10054200	just have to sit and wait here we've no choice I'm not going home until I've seen it I'm happy to wait
10054200	10060920	all day you won't find it by looking up at the sky you know what fish like it in places where there
10060920	10067800	are lots of wings oh the rafts in the middle of the lake and they just want to see the fish but you
10067800	10073640	wait I'm going to catch it maybe somebody's already caught it and you can get it in the tin
10080200	10086040	over there something shiny jumping see I told you now keep quiet
10098120	10107000	I hate fishing guess we better think about getting back otherwise we'll never get home before nightfall
10107800	10113160	I don't want to get lost on a raft in the dark on this lonely lake perhaps we were expecting too much
10114760	10120360	maybe your right snort maiden but I really thought we'd see it this is the most disappointing day of my
10120360	10123720	life we can come back yes
10128120	10130120	oh
10136120	10138120	it's not going to stop
10142920	10145080	now did you see a moment
10158360	10164520	oh
10167720	10170920	it's gigantic
10187800	10217800	I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't
10217800	10247800	know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do,
10247800	10249800	I did it! I caught it!
10249800	10250800	Pardon what?
10250800	10252800	Why the golden fish, of course?
10252800	10253800	What?
10253800	10256800	I've got the golden fish in here if you want to have a look at it.
10256800	10258800	See? It's in this bucket.
10258800	10260800	Huh?
10260800	10263800	You don't really believe that is the golden fish.
10263800	10265800	Huh? Huh?
10265800	10268800	It's just another stupid fish.
10268800	10271800	I can swear that it really was golden when I caught it.
10271800	10275800	It must have been the sun making it land in the water.
10275800	10277800	It was you said it was the golden fish.
10277800	10279800	Why don't you let it go?
10279800	10282800	You know it's not the right one and he hates it in that bucket.
10282800	10284800	Huh?
10289800	10292800	There he goes. It looks so happy now.
10292800	10295800	It really was gold when I first saw it.
10295800	10297800	We believe you sniff.
10297800	10299800	Now let's go home.
10305800	10313800	Steph and Stinky never really got home together.
10313800	10317800	They believed it was actually the golden fish they had caught.
10317800	10321800	But moving in the others were in no doubt about what they had seen.
10321800	10324800	They are the emulators of Great Britain.
10335800	10341800	They believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
10341800	10345800	They're always happy and goes at play.
10345800	10349800	The movements are having fun day after day.
10349800	10352800	The movements.
10352800	10356800	The movements.
10356800	10362800	The movements.
10365800	10372800	The movements.
10395800	10402800	They are the movements.
10402800	10405800	They are the movements.
10405800	10408800	So come with me, give me your hand.
10408800	10411800	I'll take you up to a moment land.
10411800	10414800	You can fly just like a bird.
10414800	10416800	Sing that song ever.
10416800	10419800	There were the movements.
10419800	10423800	There were the movements.
10423800	10428800	There were the movements.
10428800	10433800	There were the movements.
10433800	10442800	Snort Maiden was in a very good mood.
10442800	10446800	Because that day she was off to collect shells of the sea shore with moon.
10446800	10456800	Moonman.
10456800	10465800	Hey look, the sun's up and there's Gracie.
10465800	10469800	What's the matter Papa?
10469800	10471800	What's your moment?
10471800	10472800	What are you doing?
10472800	10475800	I heard you talking to yourself just now.
10475800	10479800	Oh.
10479800	10482800	You see this? I'm writing a play.
10482800	10483800	Writing a play.
10483800	10485800	You remember the last children?
10485800	10487800	That was a very successful play.
10487800	10489800	Just now I was repeating a line.
10489800	10493800	Hey look, another beautiful day and there goes Gracie.
10493800	10496800	It's a wonderful line, of course.
10496800	10497800	Don't you agree?
10497800	10499800	It could be improved.
10499800	10502800	I think about it.
10502800	10505800	Yeah.
10505800	10515800	Well, wait, wait, look at this.
10515800	10520800	Beautiful.
10520800	10521800	You find anything?
10521800	10530800	No, just usual old stuff.
10530800	10533800	Oh, there's another big one.
10533800	10538800	Can't you really find anything, Moonman?
10538800	10540800	I'll look somewhere else.
10540800	10542800	I still think this is the best place.
10542800	10546800	Well, I'm going over there.
10546800	10550800	You're so beautiful.
10550800	10554800	Oh.
10554800	10556800	What are you doing, Moonman?
10556800	10558800	No, that's no shell surely.
10558800	10560800	Oh, so why did you take it out?
10560800	10565800	Well, once you see it, you want to find out what it is.
10565800	10567800	A very odd thing, isn't it?
10567800	10570800	Not very interesting.
10574800	10576800	Oh no, I can see what it is.
10576800	10578800	I gave it a good wash.
10578800	10580800	I see one just like it in the fairy tales.
10580800	10581800	It's an old lamp.
10581800	10584800	Yes, you remember the story called a ladder?
10584800	10586800	He rubbed the lamp and the genie appeared.
10586800	10590800	The genie might appear for us if we do what Aladdin did.
10590800	10593800	Don't be silly, Snork Maiden.
10593800	10596800	Hmm.
10596800	10600800	But Snork Maiden, that was a fairy tale.
10600800	10603800	Don't laugh, I just want to make absolutely sure.
10603800	10606800	The tell you the truth, I've already tried it.
10606800	10609800	My hands turned green, that's all that happened to me.
10609800	10611800	Maybe you didn't do it the right way.
10611800	10614800	You can't even whip cream properly.
10614800	10617800	And I'm sure you have to say some magic words,
10617800	10620800	such as, apricot dapura, spirit, come forth,
10620800	10623800	apricot dapura, try for all your words.
10623800	10625800	You've chosen the wrong words.
10625800	10628800	You should say, come out, say something or something.
10628800	10629800	Huh?
10629800	10631800	Oh my goodness, oh my goodness!
10631800	10633800	Keep going, Snork Maiden.
10633800	10635800	Ah!
10635800	10639800	I am the spirit of the lamp.
10639800	10642800	What is your command?
10642800	10646800	Goodness, did you come out of this lamp?
10646800	10647800	You got it.
10647800	10650800	So you really are the spirit of this lamp?
10650800	10651800	Always have been.
10651800	10655800	But, but I have the book and you're not him.
10655800	10657800	I can't believe it.
10657800	10659800	I've never heard of it before.
10659800	10661800	I've never heard of it before.
10661800	10663800	I've never heard of it before.
10663800	10664800	You're not him.
10664800	10668800	I can prove it if you're quite sure you want me to.
10668800	10671800	By all means, it probably wasn't a good picture.
10671800	10674800	I'm the one and only spirit of the lamp.
10674800	10678800	Ah, then you must have the power to make any wish come true.
10678800	10679800	Is that so?
10679800	10681800	Her wish, certainly, but not yours.
10681800	10683800	But I'm the one who'll dug you out.
10683800	10685800	That's not so important, kid.
10685800	10688800	She's the one who summoned me forth from the lamp.
10688800	10690800	What are we going to do about this spirit?
10690800	10691800	Why?
10691800	10692800	Ask for something.
10692800	10694800	Ask for something you've always wanted.
10694800	10696800	Ah, let's see.
10696800	10697800	A pearl necklace.
10697800	10698800	Sorry, me.
10698800	10700800	Your wish is my command.
10700800	10703800	Hey, wait a minute.
10703800	10704800	Oh.
10704800	10707800	A pearl necklace is only one of the things I wanted.
10707800	10708800	I hadn't decided yet.
10708800	10710800	Don't worry, Snork Maiden.
10710800	10712800	I guess you can always send it back.
10712800	10715800	If I like the necklace, then it's your turn to wrap the lamp.
10715800	10717800	Then you can wish for whatever you've always wanted.
10717800	10718800	Yes.
10719800	10721800	But where exactly did you rub the lamp?
10721800	10724800	Right here, and very, very slowly.
10724800	10725800	All right.
10725800	10727800	I'll say, spirit come forth.
10727800	10730800	It sounds a little better than come out, spirit.
10736800	10737800	Oh, nice.
10737800	10739800	What was that?
10739800	10740800	Always back.
10745800	10747800	One royal necklace, Miss.
10748800	10750800	This is incredible.
10750800	10751800	Right.
10751800	10754800	I do think this is exactly what I wanted.
10754800	10756800	Oh, thank you ever so much.
10756800	10757800	All in a day's wake.
10757800	10759800	So pleased to oblige, Miss.
10762800	10764800	Are you going back into the lamp?
10764800	10765800	Yes, I am.
10765800	10766800	I'm so happy.
10766800	10768800	Now it's my turn to let you out of here.
10768800	10771800	I'd like to have a wish granted, too, please.
10771800	10773800	Now, wait a minute.
10773800	10775800	If getting in and out is a bother,
10775800	10778800	why don't you let me give you my wish right now?
10778800	10779800	Can't do it, young man.
10779800	10781800	One at a time in the face to call.
10781800	10783800	Just wanted to save time.
10783800	10785800	Impossible, young say.
10785800	10786800	But why?
10786800	10789800	Because I am only able to fulfill one wish a week.
10789800	10791800	I need my rest.
10791800	10792800	It's hard work, you know.
10792800	10795800	Oh, well, of course it's tiring.
10795800	10797800	Perhaps I expected too much from you.
10797800	10798800	Hold on.
10798800	10800800	I wouldn't like you to think that I haven't got the power.
10800800	10803800	I can do many extraordinary things.
10803800	10804800	What kind of things?
10804800	10805800	Not telling you.
10812800	10813800	Listen, moment.
10813800	10815800	We won't tell a soul about this lamp, alright?
10815800	10816800	Of course not.
10835800	10836800	No!
10836800	10838800	Names don't really matter.
10838800	10841800	Tulip Hydrangea, who cares?
10841800	10843800	No, that's not right somehow.
10843800	10845800	And uranium, a fox glove.
10845800	10847800	Oh, I'm so tired.
10865800	10867800	Oh, yeah.
10876800	10878800	Hmm.
10878800	10881800	Praise the lad and I didn't tell them I can get out at night.
10881800	10883800	I'd have no peace at all.
10883800	10886800	My leisure time would be totally ruined by these two.
10886800	10890800	Good thing also I can read their minds so I know what I'm up against.
10890800	10893800	They're up to something I know they are.
10894800	10898800	Oh, yes, dear me, dear me.
10898800	10901800	No wonder the young man is worried to death.
10901800	10902800	She was.
10902800	10904800	I better rewrite this.
10904800	10909800	Oh, Edgar, Edgar, I do wish you was somebody else.
10909800	10912800	This will certainly have to be changed.
10912800	10914800	The whole page, really.
10915800	10918800	What's going on here?
10918800	10921800	Who did this?
10921800	10924800	Mom, not you surely.
10924800	10925800	What?
10925800	10926800	What?
10926800	10927800	What?
10927800	10928800	What?
10928800	10929800	What?
10929800	10930800	What?
10930800	10931800	What?
10931800	10932800	What?
10932800	10933800	What?
10933800	10934800	What?
10934800	10935800	What?
10935800	10936800	What?
10936800	10937800	What?
10937800	10938800	What?
10938800	10939800	What?
10939800	10940800	What?
10940800	10941800	What?
10941800	10942800	What?
10942800	10943800	What?
10943800	10944800	What?
10944800	10945800	What?
10945800	10947800	Some rascals have been rewriting my play.
10947800	10949800	Who could that possibly be?
10949800	10952800	Who in need in the middle of the night while I was asleep?
10952800	10954800	It's very strange, isn't it, Papa?
10954800	10956800	It can't be you, Mom.
10956800	10958800	Of course not, Papa.
10958800	10960800	I am upset.
10960800	10961800	Who can it be?
10961800	10964800	Imagine going into your study while you were fast asleep.
10964800	10966800	It's very rude, isn't it?
10966800	10969800	I find it incredible that anyone could do such a thing.
10969800	10972800	And all the rewriting was done on those bits as I knew
10972800	10974800	weren't perfectly polished.
10974800	10978800	Listen, dear, I'm sure they were far too good for him to improve on.
10978800	10980800	No, no, you're wrong.
10980800	10982800	That's the worst thing.
10982800	10984800	I must admit he did improve them.
10984800	10987800	Then I think you should feel pleased, dear.
10987800	10988800	Yes.
10988800	10990800	No, I'm not a bit pleased.
10990800	10992800	A dramatist should write his own plays.
10992800	10994800	Looks great, Snork Maiden.
10994800	10996800	That is, if you like necklaces.
10996800	10998800	Thank you, Little Maiden.
10998800	11000800	It was given to me as a present.
11000800	11001800	Rather nice.
11001800	11003800	Would you mind if I tried it on for a minute?
11003800	11004800	Of course not.
11004800	11006800	I'm sure you'll look gorgeous.
11006800	11010800	I suppose in time one could get to like necklaces.
11010800	11013800	I could ask for a similar one for you.
11013800	11016800	Deepers, who's your rich friend?
11016800	11017800	Yes.
11017800	11021800	I searched the whole house, but I can't find it anywhere.
11021800	11023800	Someone must have stolen it.
11023800	11027800	The three Mrs. Philly Junk, I fully expect to arrest the thief any minute now.
11027800	11029800	Good afternoon, Inspector.
11029800	11030800	Hello, Snork Maiden.
11030800	11032800	Please hurry, Inspector.
11032800	11035800	The thief has almost certainly left Moomin Valley already.
11035800	11036800	Oh, dear, oh, dear.
11036800	11038800	Nothing is safe in this valley anymore.
11038800	11040800	Now calm down, Mrs. Philly Junk.
11040800	11044800	Did you just say you've had something stolen, Mrs. Philly Junk?
11044800	11048800	My pearl necklace, extraordinarily beautiful pearls, 87 of them.
11048800	11051800	Looks just like the one you're wearing, Little Maiden.
11051800	11054800	You stole it.
11054800	11056800	Did you?
11056800	11057800	Oh!
11057800	11058800	Oh, no, no!
11058800	11059800	What are you doing?
11059800	11060800	What are you doing?
11060800	11061800	Doctor!
11061800	11062800	Doctor!
11062800	11063800	Arrest her!
11063800	11065800	First, believe her she's a bee, she's innocent!
11065800	11067800	Little Maiden's beauty!
11067800	11070800	The smallest character of the most cunning and generous!
11070800	11071800	Yes!
11071800	11074800	This is Snork Maiden's necklace.
11074800	11076800	No, that's very funny, Mr. Philly!
11076800	11079800	Is that the best explanation you can think of?
11079800	11083280	No one calls Little Maya Thief and gets away with it.
11083280	11086240	Is it really true that this is your necklace, Nork Maiden?
11086240	11089480	Of course, Inspector. It was a present. I swear it.
11089480	11090760	Who gave it to you?
11090760	11093120	That's a secret between me and Moomin.
11093120	11094520	A secret?
11094520	11097280	That's a lie. They stole it, Inspector.
11097280	11099880	I've never known them to lie before, Mrs. Philly John.
11099880	11101560	They're from a very bad background.
11101560	11102800	You should see their home.
11102800	11103840	Zora!
11103840	11105680	I'm going to get fucked up.
11105680	11107400	Stop the little man.
11107400	11109360	Bad background and you got ten things.
11109360	11110360	You say that.
11110360	11111840	No, there's something I want to ask you.
11111840	11112840	Little Maya.
11112840	11113840	What are you doing?
11113840	11114840	No!
11114840	11116840	Little Maya has to be a pain, you know.
11125480	11126480	This is it.
11132680	11134480	I love to know who did this.
11134480	11136680	He's sitting there going to knock with words.
11136680	11137680	What?
11137680	11138680	Huh?
11138680	11141440	Listen to this. This is a good example.
11141440	11145640	Hey, look at the sky. The sun's up and there's Gracie.
11145640	11148600	That's not great. Sounds very ordinary.
11148600	11150520	That's what I wrote, Snuffkin.
11150520	11152520	Oh, I'm so sorry.
11152520	11153600	That's all right.
11153600	11156000	Now, listen to how he rewrote it.
11156000	11159880	But soft, what light through yonder window breaks.
11159880	11162320	It is the East, and Juliet is the sun.
11162320	11164400	Arise, Verson.
11164400	11167640	And kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale
11167640	11169440	with grief.
11169440	11171120	What a sunrise.
11171120	11173240	And note how clever this writer is to change
11173240	11176400	her name from Gracie to Juliet.
11176400	11178440	Gracie's worried because her parents don't approve
11178440	11180000	of her love, Edgar.
11180000	11182040	I had it as names don't matter.
11182040	11184440	Tulip, I'd rangers, who cares?
11184440	11185840	But listen to this.
11185840	11187080	What's in a name?
11187080	11189560	That which we call a rose by any other name
11189560	11193600	would smell as sweet, much more romantic.
11193600	11194600	I got a show.
11194600	11195600	Oh, you wouldn't.
11195600	11197320	Or he'd not a Romeo called.
11197320	11198760	Oh, it's simply great.
11198760	11201240	Except maybe I wouldn't have mentioned his smell.
11201240	11205080	Don't you agree, he's an excellent playwright.
11205080	11206040	Yes, I agree.
11206040	11208440	He sounds like a very promising playwright.
11208440	11210880	And then wordy, perhaps, but really good.
11210880	11212760	Very good indeed.
11212760	11215520	Write him a note asking him to carry on.
11215520	11217080	And there might not be necessary.
11217080	11219560	You know, all the changes were made in the middle of the night
11219560	11221880	while I was fast asleep, and usually
11221880	11224120	writers are in their beds, none of their desks
11224120	11226960	when they're asleep.
11226960	11230440	Well, yes, that's the only time you're not at your desk, isn't it?
11230440	11233400	But there are people you know who walk about at night
11233400	11236000	without remembering about it the next morning.
11236000	11237680	Sleepwalk, as you mean.
11237680	11239160	Now I come to think of it.
11239160	11241680	You were rather sleepy when you woke up this morning.
11241680	11245200	You're right, Mum and Mama, even sleepier than usual.
11245200	11246440	Just so.
11246440	11248640	You mean you yourself got up at night
11248640	11251640	and then went and rewrote the play in your sleep?
11251640	11255600	Well, yes, I have been worried about some minor things
11255600	11257000	in my play.
11257000	11260800	So my subconsciousness, fairly rich and literary talent,
11260800	11263000	as we all know, comes to the rescue.
11263000	11264120	A moment, Papa.
11264120	11267720	And in my sleep, my imagination runs riot.
11267720	11269880	I have all sorts of good ideas that make me
11269880	11271720	grab a pen in the middle of the night
11271720	11277600	and rush to my room to let the real skill throw.
11277600	11278960	Got it.
11278960	11279800	I got it.
11279800	11280760	I got it.
11280760	11282680	With this, I can have anything.
11282680	11284240	I can do anything.
11284240	11285240	Stop.
11285240	11286240	Stop.
11286240	11288680	When I say stop, you have to stop.
11288680	11290720	He's not expecting me.
11290720	11294720	I can be a fan of him, so you already.
11294720	11296880	We've arrived when you weren't getting last.
11296880	11298040	Get lost yourself.
11298040	11299560	I don't have time for you.
11299560	11301440	The inspector's chasing me.
11301440	11302480	What, you?
11302480	11303520	Stop, little boy.
11303520	11304440	I'm the inspector.
11304440	11306080	You have to stop when I say so.
11306080	11307840	He's not chasing me, Mum.
11307840	11308800	Don't deny it.
11308800	11309880	I know why you're running.
11309880	11311440	You stole that thing, didn't you?
11311440	11313440	I know it's true.
11313440	11315080	That's from the pure business.
11315080	11316400	It's not yours.
11316400	11319280	But it must be somebody, so I'll make it my business.
11319280	11320960	Get it to me.
11320960	11322520	Or is that me?
11322520	11326880	Please stop me, I'm going to give it back to me.
11326880	11331160	Hey, that looks like the lamp we've found.
11331160	11333400	Chase him, it's better not be.
11333400	11334880	Oh, no.
11334880	11338920	Well, man, Stinky's got our magic lamp right after him.
11338920	11339920	Yes.
11339920	11341040	We can't let him get away with it.
11341040	11343240	Our terrible things might happen.
11343240	11345280	Did you hear that, Stinky?
11345280	11347840	He said magic lamp or something.
11347840	11349400	After him.
11349400	11350840	The magic lamp is mine.
11350840	11352360	Just leave me alone.
11352360	11353960	Well, you guys, Stinky.
11353960	11355880	Help me get the necklace.
11355880	11356760	No, no, no, no.
11356760	11358320	This one is taking me.
11358320	11359400	Oh, no.
11359400	11360400	Oh, no.
11360400	11361400	Get a stick.
11361400	11362400	Get a stick.
11362400	11363400	Oh, no.
11363400	11364400	Get a stick.
11364400	11365400	Get a stick.
11365400	11366400	Get a stick.
11366400	11367400	Get a stick.
11367400	11368400	Get a stick.
11368400	11369400	Oh, my dear.
11369400	11370400	He's coming.
11370400	11371400	He's coming.
11371400	11372400	No.
11372400	11373400	Oh.
11373400	11381640	You're the spirit of the lamp, aren't you?
11381640	11382640	Yes, my master.
11382640	11383640	What is your wish?
11383640	11384640	You his master?
11384640	11385640	Yes, me.
11385640	11387640	I'm the master.
11387640	11390800	I let him out, so he'll do what I say.
11390800	11394840	I don't believe a word of this fairy tale's untrue.
11394840	11397200	Maybe it isn't true, but it works.
11397200	11401440	I saw a snork maiden wishing for a pearl necklace, and her wish was granted.
11401440	11404440	Uh-huh, so you're responsible.
11404440	11406640	Yeah, and I brought it right away.
11406640	11409280	God, now let me see.
11409280	11411800	What do I want more than anything in the world?
11411800	11415080	Stinky, he can only make one wish a week come true.
11415080	11416680	You'll have to wait your turn.
11416680	11419760	No, that's very unfair.
11419760	11421360	Let's get back to the necklace.
11421360	11422960	Where did you steal it from, mister?
11422960	11423960	I don't steal.
11423960	11426680	Well, then tell me where you found it.
11426680	11428280	Around here somewhere.
11428280	11430360	Mrs. Philly, John's house, baby.
11430360	11431760	I don't know who lives there.
11431760	11434040	Oh, then you did steal the necklace.
11434040	11437160	Well, that's a lot easier, you know.
11437160	11441400	How about a magic key that can open anything, Boltson safes and stuff, huh?
11441400	11444120	Listen, there's something I'd like to ask you.
11444120	11448040	A sack of gold wouldn't be half as much fun as a key that opens anything.
11448040	11451920	Tell me, is it possible that you rewrote woman poppers play?
11451920	11452920	Yes, I did.
11452920	11454240	It was really awful.
11454240	11456920	Oh, come on, now I just needed some polishing.
11456920	11460480	And what's more, see this young man standing here?
11460480	11463400	Well, he was really worried about your play, you know.
11463400	11464920	I was just trying to help.
11464920	11465920	Is this true?
11465920	11469280	Yeah, safer than mercury, of course.
11469280	11472400	But then there's professional pride to think of.
11472400	11473680	I can explain, Papa.
11473680	11475720	I saw you weren't happy about your play,
11475720	11479160	and I wanted it to be a big success.
11479160	11481880	Of course, I didn't want the spirit to write it himself.
11481880	11483800	I'm going to take the key, yeah.
11483800	11487880	I've just realized, everybody, the spirit didn't write all that himself.
11487880	11489080	I've heard it before.
11489080	11490880	I thought it sounded familiar.
11490880	11492680	Really, is that so?
11492680	11496160	Yes, he stole it from a play by somebody else.
11496160	11498960	This spirit is a cheat and a liar.
11498960	11501200	Oh, dear me.
11501200	11503200	Well, I can't help being so well read.
11503200	11504640	Can I go back in the lamp now?
11504640	11506760	No, wait, don't run, yes, don't.
11506760	11508600	I want to explain this now.
11508600	11510320	Sorry, Master, can't oblige.
11510320	11512880	Have them put into an impossible situation.
11512880	11513880	See you next week.
11518160	11520000	But that's ridiculous.
11520000	11523320	Not next week, nor next month, nor even next year.
11523320	11525680	Stinky, this lamp is not yours.
11525680	11528600	Besides, I know exactly the sort of thing you'd ask for.
11528600	11531960	A master key or something.
11531960	11534880	You think you can hide that magic lamp from me, do you?
11534880	11539880	Well, there's no hiding place good enough for that.
11539880	11541920	Well, then, I really do think that lamp
11541920	11545000	is a bit too dangerous to have a rod.
11545000	11546800	I think you're right.
11546800	11549600	Snuffkin, do you have any good ideas for us?
11563080	11565520	We can pass, so we can summon the spirit again.
11569880	11575880	There's the inspector.
11581880	11583880	You do it, Snuffkin.
11583880	11584880	Call the spirit.
11593880	11594880	Oh, no, not again.
11594880	11596880	What do you want this time?
11596880	11598880	Can you bring the hobgoblin here?
11599880	11600880	I suppose so.
11600880	11602880	I'll be back as soon as I can.
11609880	11612880	But why on earth do you want the hobgoblin?
11612880	11616880	As far as I can see, there's only one safe place for the lamp
11616880	11618880	where no one can find it.
11618880	11621880	And that's on another planet, and the only one who can put it there
11621880	11623880	is the hobgoblin.
11623880	11624880	He's coming any minute.
11624880	11627880	Geez, that guy ever hard to find.
11627880	11628880	Thank you.
11628880	11630880	I've done my wake for this week.
11630880	11631880	See you next week.
11631880	11632880	Goodbye!
11650880	11653880	And some of the hobgoblin took the magic ram away
11653880	11656880	and hid it on some unknown planet.
11656880	11660880	And a good thing too, it would really be very boring
11660880	11663880	if all your wishes were granted, wouldn't it?
11686880	11691880	The day after day, the moon is.
11691880	11695880	The moon is.
11695880	11700880	The moon is.
11716880	11726880	Here they are for one and all.
11726880	11729880	The movements are about to come.
11729880	11732880	Come on and sit down here with me.
11732880	11734880	They're for you on your TV.
11734880	11737880	They are the movements.
11737880	11740880	They are the movements.
11740880	11743880	So come with me, give me your hand.
11743880	11746880	I'll take you up to a moment land.
11746880	11749880	You can fly just like a bird.
11749880	11752880	Sing that song ever.
11752880	11754880	There were the movements.
11754880	11757880	There were the movements.
11757880	11760880	There were the movements.
11760880	11763880	There were the movements.
11763880	11766880	There were the movements.
11766880	11769880	There were the movements.
11773880	11776880	There were the movements.
11776880	11779880	There were the movements.
11779880	11782880	There were the movements.
11782880	11785880	There were the movements.
11793880	11796880	Winter was just around the corner.
11796880	11802880	And that was the time of year for movement to get restless.
11802880	11809880	Snuffkin, why?
11809880	11816880	Because this was the time of year for snuffkin to leave movement valley on his yearly trek south.
11816880	11826880	Good morning, Papa.
11826880	11834880	That bonfire looks inviting.
11834880	11836880	You're up already.
11836880	11841880	We're buried in leaves this morning after that wind last night.
11841880	11843880	Yes, winders on the way.
11843880	11846880	Oh, this is a lovely bonfire.
11846880	11849880	Yes, isn't it?
11849880	11851880	I guess we're hibernating again this winter.
11851880	11853880	Are we moving, Papa?
11853880	11855880	Well, of course.
11855880	11857880	We always hibernate in the winter.
11857880	11859880	If snuffkin says I could go with him,
11859880	11863880	couldn't I give this winter a miss and hibernate longer next year?
11863880	11864880	More.
11864880	11866880	Oh, please, moving, Papa.
11866880	11869880	Snuffkin would rather go alone, I think, movement.
11870880	11873880	But I might get him to train his mind.
11873880	11876880	That snuffkin's not really a person who likes to be pressed.
11876880	11878880	Why not?
11878880	11881880	Well, he's a very solitary person.
11881880	11885880	His winter trip is the only time he can really be alone for a while.
11885880	11887880	I know, but I was just hoping.
11887880	11891880	Snuffkin likes you very much, I know that.
11891880	11895880	And I think that's why he stays in movement valley for the rest of the year.
11895880	11900880	But at heart, he's a vagabond and he needs time away from us.
11900880	11903880	He's not a family man, so he's free to do as he wants.
11903880	11906880	And as his friend, you should try to understand.
11906880	11910880	I know you'd like to go with him, but I don't think he's such a good idea.
11910880	11913880	He'd really hate to turn you down, I know.
11913880	11915880	I guess.
11915880	11917880	But he'd have to.
11920880	11922880	Oh.
11926880	11928880	Oh.
11931880	11935880	Why aren't they biting?
11935880	11938880	I haven't had a proper catch for days.
11938880	11940880	Getting too cold, is that?
11943880	11945880	When are you leaving?
11945880	11947880	You're about to leave, aren't you?
11947880	11950880	Yes.
11951880	11955880	Could I ask you something?
11955880	11957880	What?
11957880	11959880	Don't go without telling me.
11959880	11961880	But why?
11961880	11965880	I'm always sad when you leave, even though I know you'll return in the spring.
11965880	11968880	Yeah. Me too, sort of.
11968880	11971880	That's why this year I'd plan to leave without saying anything.
11971880	11975880	But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly.
11975880	11977880	I'd like to wish you good luck and all that.
11977880	11979880	I miss you so much when you're away.
11979880	11982880	Please, Nuffkin.
11982880	11984880	Moomin, I have a better idea.
11984880	11986880	I won't leave until after you've started hibernating.
11986880	11988880	Then you won't miss me, will you?
11988880	11989880	You're right.
11989880	11991880	I'll take me right out here, Snuffkin.
11991880	11993880	Then we won't really part at all, won't we?
11993880	11994880	Nope.
11994880	11998880	Because I promised to be back here in Moomin Valley before you've even woken up.
11998880	12001880	Wonderful! What a super idea!
12001880	12006880	Hey, Moomin!
12006880	12008880	Oh, Snuff.
12008880	12010880	Moomin, come here a minute.
12010880	12012880	There's something funny caught up in a tree.
12012880	12014880	What do you mean, funny?
12014880	12017880	I don't know exactly never saw anything like it before.
12017880	12021880	Snork made a little myfounded first, but it's too high to get it down.
12021880	12023880	Okay, I'll come have a look.
12028880	12030880	Be careful.
12032880	12036880	Be careful. What is it, Moomin?
12039880	12042880	I know what it is. It's a kite.
12042880	12043880	Oh, what?
12043880	12045880	A kite is something you find in the sky.
12045880	12047880	But it has no wings.
12047880	12050880	No, you send it up against the wind on a string.
12051880	12052880	Bye!
12075880	12077880	Be careful.
12077880	12084880	Where'd it go?
12084880	12086880	Oh, through it though.
12086880	12094880	That's all right!
12094880	12097880	Oh, song!
12097880	12100880	This is what a kite looks like.
12100880	12102880	Looks broken to me.
12102880	12105880	I'm sure we can fix it and make it fly.
12105880	12106880	Let's see.
12106880	12107880	Oh, no.
12107880	12112880	The string must have broken when someone was flying it and the wind blew it down into the tree.
12112880	12114880	Well, why don't we repair it?
12114880	12115880	Yes, let's.
12115880	12117880	Looks pretty badly broken to me.
12117880	12118880	Well, I don't know.
12118880	12123880	We'll have to see.
12123880	12125880	It is a kite, isn't it?
12125880	12127880	Can we mend it?
12127880	12132880	Maybe.
12132880	12134880	A very odd kite.
12134880	12136880	It must have come from far away.
12136880	12138880	You think it can be repaired?
12138880	12139880	Of course.
12139880	12140880	Well, come on then.
12140880	12142880	Snork will help you repair it.
12142880	12144880	I can repair it without your help.
12144880	12147880	As long as you can find us some really long string.
12147880	12150880	Strong but not too thick if possible.
12150880	12152880	I think I have what you need.
12152880	12153880	Some string.
12153880	12154880	Good.
12154880	12155880	Excellent.
12155880	12157880	I'll start immediately.
12162880	12163880	Good.
12163880	12164880	Good.
12164880	12165880	Good.
12165880	12166880	Good.
12166880	12167880	Good.
12167880	12168880	Good.
12168880	12169880	Good.

12214880	12215880	Good.
12215880	12216880	Hey.
12216880	12218880	Thanks for watching.
12218880	12223880	This is a really exciting project I haven't flown a kite for years.
12223880	12226880	I do hope that string is long enough.
12226880	12228880	Snorke, is this okay?
12228880	12230880	Fine, who's gonna fly it?
12230880	12232880	I'll do it.
12232880	12233880	Okay, Sniff.
12233880	12236880	Moving, hold the kite up high.
12236880	12237880	Like this?
12237880	12240880	Hmm. All right, Sniff, are you ready?
12240880	12244880	Yeah, I'm ready. Don't let go until I say win.
12248880	12250880	Win, moment!
12252880	12254880	Ho!
12256880	12258880	Uh-oh, it's falling.
12258880	12264880	Try again, and this time start running and when the win catches the kite, you start paying out the lie.
12264880	12267880	All right, fine. Hold it up again, moment.
12267880	12269880	Right.
12269880	12270880	Ready?
12270880	12273880	Yeah, I'm ready. Let go of it!
12273880	12276880	Easy going up, kid!
12278880	12283880	No, it isn't! Stop, Sniff! You're breaking the kite!
12283880	12287880	I don't think this kite's any good for anybody!
12287880	12291880	The kite's fine. It's just that the wind is too weak.
12291880	12294880	All right, we'll have to wait for it to get stronger.
12294880	12298880	Pretty though, we certainly had a good strong wind yesterday.
12298880	12300880	Is it okay?
12300880	12303880	I think the wind is getting stronger, moment.
12308880	12310880	Oh!
12320880	12322880	There it goes!
12328880	12330880	Let me hold the string, moment.
12333880	12336880	Boy, this wind is really strong! Can I let out the string now?
12336880	12338880	Do it slowly, mind!
12338880	12340880	All right!
12343880	12346880	Let me do it, Sniff! Come on, it's my turn!
12346880	12348880	I'm afraid you can't, little lie.
12348880	12351880	Why not? Because you don't win, up to all it!
12351880	12353880	I'm very strong!
12353880	12356880	The wind is quite strong! You come up with it!
12357880	12358880	Yes, Papa?
12358880	12360880	It's difficult to hold it for a while.
12360880	12362880	Well, yes, you'd like it.
12362880	12364880	Hold it really tight, then.
12376880	12380880	All right, I could do this long before he was born.
12380880	12382880	Oops!
12383880	12386880	Oh, what's happening?
12388880	12390880	Papa, wipe it up quickly.
12390880	12393880	And I'm winding, I'm winding.
12393880	12395880	Faster, I'm winding faster!
12395880	12397880	What's going on?
12397880	12399880	What's going on?
12399880	12401880	What's going on?
12407880	12409880	That was definitely not my fault.
12409880	12411880	Of course it wasn't.
12411880	12413880	With such a strong wind up there,
12413880	12416880	I think we have to lower the centre of gravity a bit.
12419880	12421880	The kite's all right, Papa!
12421880	12425880	Hmm, maybe it would take me with it.
12439880	12441880	That's it!
12441880	12444880	I suppose that's to stop it from spinning around. Is it snorke?
12444880	12446880	Yes, that's right.
12453880	12455880	What is it?
12457880	12459880	Listen, I'm going to ride that kite.
12459880	12461880	What did you say?
12461880	12464880	I think it's going to be okay now.
12464880	12466880	If I hold on really tight,
12466880	12468880	I think I could have a wonderful ride on that kite.
12468880	12471880	Yes, maybe it'd be wonderful while you're up in the sky,
12471880	12474880	but you've seen how fast it can come down again.
12474880	12477880	But the snorke just said it won't fall down again.
12477880	12478880	Even so!
12478880	12480880	I'm going to do it, but no one must see me
12480880	12483880	or they might try to stop me if they guess what I'm up to.
12483880	12485880	Oh, please don't do it.
12485880	12487880	What are you doing?
12487880	12489880	Listen carefully.
12489880	12491880	Yes.
12491880	12494880	When we fly the kite next time,
12494880	12497880	what are you two whispering about?
12497880	12499880	We weren't snorke, Maiden.
12499880	12502880	I was just saying to Sniff that the kite wouldn't fall down again.
12502880	12504880	It won't! Snorke is fixed it.
12504880	12506880	But you can't be absolutely sure.
12506880	12509880	And you'll be holding the kite, won't you, Sniff?
12509880	12510880	Me?
12510880	12512880	Now then, do you want to do it, Moomin?
12512880	12515880	Yes, and this time I'll let out all the line.
12515880	12518880	And Sniff, you could hold it up, okay?
12518880	12519880	Yes, that's fine.
12519880	12520880	No!
12520880	12522880	I'm counting on you, Sniff.
12522880	12524880	And so am I, Sniff.
12524880	12526880	Hmm.
12534880	12536880	Are you sure you'll be all right?
12536880	12538880	Of course I will, silly.
12538880	12540880	Well, I'm not so sure.
12540880	12542880	Why don't you keep your eyes closed, then?
12542880	12544880	Good idea.
12544880	12546880	Okay, Sniff.
12546880	12548880	Let go of it when I say ready.
12548880	12550880	Bye.
12550880	12552880	Ready!
12552880	12554880	Go!
12554880	12557880	Yay!
12557880	12560880	Yay!
12560880	12562880	Yay!
12562880	12565880	Yay!
12565880	12568880	Yay!
12568880	12571880	Yay!
12571880	12573880	Yay, yay!
12573880	12575880	Yay!
12575880	12578880	Yay!
12578880	12602880	That's it. That's all of the line. It's very high. Must be some wind up there. It's flying really well, isn't it? Certainly is.
12602880	12616880	This is getting bumpy. What's that? Let's see if there's something very strange happening on that kite.
12616880	12627880	What is it? I can't see properly from here. I saw something. Could it be a bird maybe? The kite is turned again, but it wasn't a bird.
12627880	12636880	Or a twig or something, then. Did you see the back of the kite from where you are, Sniff? No, Mom and Mama, because my eyes are closed.
12636880	12642880	Oh, I think I know who it is. Little Mai. What?
12645880	12652880	No, I haven't seen one of my four. She seems to have disappeared. Don't ask me anything. I know nothing at all about it.
12652880	12659880	Sniff, what do you mean? Well, she was dead set on riding the kite. I couldn't stop her. What?
12659880	12663880	Moment, bring it down very slowly.
12663880	12677880	Take it easy, moving. That wind is strong. It could break the line.
12677880	12688880	But that was what a friend was best streamed. It's the knot I wore in the board knot. The one between our line and the bit that was still hanging from the kite when we found it.
12688880	12695880	The line is fine, if the knot is another one.
12715880	12717880	Hang on tight little Mai.
12717880	12720880	That wind is getting stronger.
12723880	12726880	Oh, this is more scarier than I thought.
12729880	12732880	I'll just have to hang on as best as I can.
12734880	12737880	Don't move around so much. I can't help it.
12738880	12742880	It's almost down. What?
12747880	12748880	Oh.
12755880	12759880	It's not open. Come on. Sniff, get up.
12759880	12762880	All right. Sniff, play yourself together.
12762880	12764880	Yes, all right.
12766880	12769880	She's being blown away towards lonely mountains.
12769880	12771880	Mama!
12771880	12775880	Oh, I do hope little Mai really is indestructible.
12783880	12786880	Where in the world is this kite taking me?
12788880	12792880	All lonely mountains, I'm a long way from home.
12794880	12796880	Little Mai! Little Mai!
12797880	12799880	Now she's going towards the forest of witches.
12799880	12802880	She'll be all right if she fell into a tree, wouldn't she?
12804880	12806880	I can't see her. There's no sign of her.
12806880	12809880	Well, I'm almost sure she was heading this way.
12812880	12814880	What is it, Sniff?
12814880	12818880	Imagine she might have fallen somewhere. She might be lying there waiting for help.
12818880	12821880	Oh, stop imagining things, Sniff.
12821880	12823880	She's still up there. I'm sure of it.
12824880	12826880	Huh?
12826880	12827880	What is it, Papa?
12827880	12829880	I saw something up there.
12829880	12830880	Little Mai?
12830880	12832880	No, Sniff.
12832880	12836880	No, it looked more like the Hobgoblin riding his panther through the sky.
12836880	12837880	Really?
12838880	12840880	Did you see that? Did you?
12840880	12842880	You found the Mai.
12844880	12846880	No, the Hobgoblin. Then it was him.
12846880	12849880	Forget the Hobgoblin. We're looking for little Mai.
12849880	12852880	And all you can think of is the Hobgoblin.
12854880	12856880	Oh, come on, let's go out here.
12865880	12866880	Oh, come on.
12866880	12867880	Oh, come on.
12872880	12874880	Oh, come on.
12874880	12876880	Oh, come on.
12876880	12878880	Oh, come on.
12878880	12880880	Oh, no!
12880880	12883880	Stop it, you're screaming!
12883880	12885880	Let the white hair stop!
12885880	12886880	Oh, no!
12886880	12888880	Oh, no!
12888880	12891880	Oh, no!
12898880	12900880	Where could she be?
12900880	12901880	This is no good.
12901880	12905880	We'll never find her wondering about like this.
12905880	12907880	Moomin, over here.
12907880	12909880	You found her?
12912880	12914880	There she is.
12921880	12924880	Try to cheer up, Snork Maiden.
12924880	12925880	I'll try.
12925880	12927880	Don't worry, Snork Maiden.
12927880	12929880	Moomin Papa will find her for sure.
12929880	12931880	Eh?
12932880	12935880	Mama, Snork Maiden!
12937880	12939880	Oh, no!
12943880	12945880	I'm so glad to see you.
12945880	12948880	But I just knew you'd be alright.
12949880	12953880	Like Moomin Mama said, little lie really is indestructible.
12953880	12957880	But just possibly it served her right to have her hair pulled.
12962880	12964880	Hmm, there's still no sign of little lie?
12964880	12966880	No.
12971880	12973880	Be careful, Moomin!
12979880	12981880	Go!
12985880	12987880	Hang on, Moomin!
12987880	12989880	To me, Moomin Papa!
12992880	12995880	Finally, Lenin was rescued too.
12995880	13000880	But he only certainly had a fine worst scar than little lie.
13003880	13010880	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
13010880	13017880	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
13018880	13021880	They're always happy and goes at play.
13021880	13025880	The Moons are having fun day after day.
13025880	13028880	The Moons!
13028880	13032880	The Moons!
13032880	13038880	The Moons!
13048880	13054880	Here they are for one and all.
13054880	13057880	The Moons are about to call.
13057880	13060880	Come on and sit down here with me.
13060880	13063880	They're here for you on your TV.
13063880	13065880	They are the Moons.
13065880	13068880	They are the Moons.
13069880	13072880	So come with me, give me your hand.
13072880	13075880	I'll take you up to Moomin Land.
13075880	13077880	You can fly just like a bird.
13077880	13080880	Sing the best song ever.
13080880	13082880	There were the Moons.
13082880	13085880	There were the Moons.
13085880	13087880	There were the Moons.
13087880	13090880	There were the Moons.
13090880	13093880	There were the Moons.
13093880	13096880	There were the Moons.
13097880	13100880	There were the Moons.
13100880	13103880	There were the Moons.
13103880	13106880	There were the Moons.
13121880	13125880	These days, women and snuffkin were together even more than ever.
13126880	13141880	Winter would hit Moomin Valley any day now, and then they would have to part.
13141880	13149880	Moomin, to go into hibernation and snuck into me for his trip south.
13149880	13154880	Huh? Well, why? You look sad for something upset you?
13154880	13158880	Where are you off to, Moomin? To the lonely mountains.
13158880	13161880	How come you two are always stealing off somewhere?
13161880	13165880	We're not stealing off. We're just going for a walk to lonely mountains.
13165880	13170880	Just the two of you? You're even worse than usual, never taking any of us with you.
13170880	13173880	I hadn't noticed are we really doing that?
13173880	13175880	I'm not sure, maybe we are.
13175880	13179880	No, maybe he's about it and let me tell you it's very rude.
13179880	13183880	But we were just off for a walk. I know. Well then, why are you going?
13183880	13188880	It'll start snowing any day now, little might, and then we won't be able to go anywhere, will we?
13188880	13192880	We wanted a last look at Moomin Valley from above before that happens.
13192880	13193880	A likely story.
13193880	13199880	But it's true. I'm off very soon, and I wanted to see it all to give me a picture to remember while I'm walking.
13199880	13203880	Hmm. Did you hear that, Snarkman? Sniff, come here!
13207880	13211880	Moomin, do you mind if we come along with you? Of course not.
13211880	13216880	You see, we thought you were probably plotting something secret and weren't letting any of us in on it.
13216880	13221880	Oh, come on, we don't have any secrets from you. It's just that, well, you know what I mean.
13221880	13224880	Sniff can be leaving for months and months very soon.
13224880	13226880	Never mind, off we go.
13234880	13238880	It would be fun to see it all from here in the middle of winter all white.
13238880	13240880	It must be very beautiful.
13240880	13241880	Oh, I don't think so.
13241880	13243880	With everything white and clean?
13243880	13245880	In summer, it's very beautiful.
13245880	13249880	Well, I'm coming back here in winter to see it for myself.
13249880	13251880	You can't do that, you're hibernating.
13251880	13256880	Well, maybe not. I thought that this year I'd try to keep awake all winter.
13256880	13259880	You mean just like Moomin and I did last year? Yes!
13259880	13261880	You could never do it.
13261880	13264880	What about you? Are you hibernating?
13264880	13269880	I'm not all that mad about the snow and the cold and dark, so I'll hibernate.
13269880	13273880	I'm very happy to be going home. I've seen it all now.
13273880	13276880	Well, we didn't ask you to come along a little light.
13276880	13280880	Why don't we go take a look at that beautiful lake against Sniff, the one with the golden fish?
13280880	13282880	Oh, no, that's too far away.
13282880	13286880	You're just afraid of the forest of witches, aren't you, Sniff?
13286880	13288880	Not at all, I'm not a bit scared.
13288880	13291880	Hey, look! Who's that?
13295880	13297880	Nobody I know.
13297880	13298880	Wonder what she's doing here.
13298880	13299880	Sitting down.
13299880	13301880	Don't say such silly things, Sniff.
13308880	13309880	Hello there.
13309880	13310880	Hello there.
13310880	13313880	What are you doing up there?
13314880	13315880	I'm waiting.
13315880	13317880	For what? For grandma.
13317880	13319880	Out here all alone.
13319880	13325880	Well, grandma told me there was a big rock by the path leading up to Lonely Mountains and to wait there.
13325880	13328880	But there are other rocks by the path, you know?
13328880	13329880	Or there?
13331880	13334880	But this is the only one I've seen so far.
13334880	13337880	Your grandma must be crazy or something making you wait in a place like this.
13337880	13341880	No, our house is in the forest and she's coming to show me the way.
13341880	13342880	In the forest?
13342880	13344880	You mean the forest of witches?
13344880	13348880	Yes, I suppose so. It's not very far from here.
13348880	13350880	That's it, definitely.
13350880	13352880	How long have you been waiting here?
13352880	13353880	About an hour.
13353880	13354880	One hour?
13354880	13356880	She's not very punctual.
13356880	13358880	Perhaps I was early.
13358880	13360880	Yes, she was an hour early.
13360880	13362880	Oh, it's grandma.
13366880	13368880	Welcome, Alicia.
13372880	13375880	Where do you find all these children, my dear?
13375880	13379880	I hear all alone and then they came along the path and waited to help.
13379880	13381880	Very kind of you, I'm sure.
13381880	13385880	Well, don't just stand there, my dear. Let's go.
13385880	13387880	Come along.
13391880	13395880	Excuse me, excuse me, ma'am, but don't you live in the forest?
13395880	13397880	Indeed I do.
13397880	13399880	In what part of it?
13399880	13401880	Let me see. It must be about right in the middle.
13401880	13403880	Interesting.
13403880	13407880	The only place I know of is an old house where they say witches used to live.
13407880	13409880	You don't say, young man.
13409880	13413880	Well, what do you know? What will he think of next?
13426880	13428880	Her grandmother is...
13428880	13430880	A witch, I think?
13430880	13432880	But surely, they don't exist.
13432880	13436880	Of course not, like dragons don't exist.
13436880	13438880	Well, she doesn't seem like a nasty one.
13438880	13440880	How can you tell, moment?
13440880	13444880	I don't think that nice girl would have a bad one for a grandma.
13444880	13446880	Perhaps not.
13446880	13450880	So tell me what makes you think she's a witch, eh?
13450880	13453880	Who else could live in that forest, Papa?
13453880	13456880	I can't think of anyone right now, but some people would like it.
13456880	13458880	Yes, I suppose you're right.
13458880	13460880	I hope you are.
13460880	13464880	I've lived in Moomin Valley for a long time and I've never once seen a witch.
13464880	13466880	So they don't exist?
13470880	13471880	Yes.
13471880	13473880	Oh, stop working now, Snorke. Dinner's ready.
13473880	13475880	Fine, coming.
13479880	13482880	No wonder it's so light. Look, the moon is up.
13482880	13488880	Snorke, Maiden, I think it would be very wise for you to stay with the Moomin's from tonight on.
13488880	13490880	Why on earth do you think that's Snorke?
13490880	13493880	I've decided not to hibernate this winter.
13493880	13495880	Why ever not?
13495880	13499880	I want to complete the blueprint for my new flying ship by next spring.
13499880	13503880	For a real inventor, sleep is an unnecessary luxury.
13503880	13508880	Science, my dear Snorke, Maiden, will not wait while inventors take a nap.
13508880	13512880	But you know, dear Snorke, how dependent you are on your sleep.
13512880	13513880	I'll stay with you.
13513880	13517880	Very well, then, this winter I will hibernate with the Moomin's.
13517880	13522880	Excellent. Shall we have dinner? I'm ready now.
13531880	13535880	Most certainly, Snorke. Snorke Maiden will be just fine here with us.
13535880	13537880	Thank you.
13537880	13541880	This is nice for Moomin, too. Now he'll have Snorke Maiden to keep him company.
13541880	13542880	Yes.
13542880	13545880	But who needs company when they're hibernating?
13545880	13547880	After all, Moomin will be fast asleep.
13547880	13551880	Never the less. Sleeping is much nicer when someone else sleeps in the same room.
13551880	13554880	When do we start hibernating, do you think?
13554880	13557880	With weather like this in another few days, I guess.
13557880	13558880	So early?
13558880	13560880	We'll have snow before the week is out.
13560880	13562880	Well, good luck with your new blueprint, Snorke.
13562880	13565880	I look forward to seeing your flying ship in the spring.
13565880	13569880	Hmm, come this time next year. I'll definitely be flying about.
13573880	13575880	Thanks again for taking Snorke Maiden.
13575880	13578880	It's not trouble at all. Good night, then.
13578880	13579880	Good night, Snorke.
13579880	13581880	See you, Snorke Maiden.
13581880	13583880	Bye.
13583880	13586880	Good luck this winter, Snorke.
13591880	13595880	Thank goodness at last I can really concentrate on my work.
13598880	13600880	Huh?
13603880	13606880	I don't believe this.
13610880	13612880	Am I hallucinating?
13623880	13625880	Hello?
13626880	13628880	Oh!
13633880	13639880	Oh, which I'm sure it was. I'm positive. I'm a broomstick.
13639880	13642880	And when the Snorke gets an idea in his head,
13642880	13645880	it's not much room for anyone or anything else, is there?
13645880	13647880	I hope you'll succeed this time.
13647880	13650880	At least in my dream that rounding really flew well.
13650880	13654880	I often dream that I fly, but I wouldn't dream of trying it out.
13654880	13657880	Snorke must have had some sort of a new idea.
13659880	13661880	It's Snorke.
13663880	13666880	What's the matter?
13676880	13679880	Oh, that's my piece of cake.
13680880	13682880	You look like you've seen a ghost.
13682880	13685880	Not a ghost. She laughed at me.
13685880	13688880	Who did? She was flying on a broom.
13688880	13689880	No engine at all.
13689880	13691880	Are you talking about the witch?
13691880	13694880	There's no point if you can do it so easily.
13694880	13696880	Pull yourself together.
13696880	13697880	You really swore?
13697880	13698880	Yes.
13698880	13699880	But where?
13699880	13701880	Right near here.
13707880	13710880	I can't see any witch up there, Snorke.
13710880	13712880	Just the moon up in the sky.
13722880	13724880	And she was really flying in the sky?
13724880	13726880	Is that what Snorke said?
13726880	13729880	Well, he should know about things that fly.
13729880	13732880	But I just can't believe it until I've seen it myself.
13732880	13735880	If she really is a witch, then what about the girl?
13735880	13738880	I mean, no one could be happy living with a witch.
13738880	13741880	I really don't know. I thought witches had to be old.
13741880	13745880	Maybe it's not her real grandmother. She could be adopted.
13745880	13748880	Well, moment, we must get to the bottom of this.
13748880	13750880	Yes, Snuffkin. We must.
13752880	13753880	Huh.
13758880	13761880	Ha, I caught you at it again, you and your secret plan.
13761880	13763880	Where are you going?
13763880	13765880	Today you can't come with us with a little fly.
13765880	13766880	And why not?
13766880	13768880	Because we're going on a dangerous mission.
13768880	13770880	We're going to the forest of witches.
13770880	13775880	Well, if you're in any danger, then I must certainly come along to look after you, Moon.
13775880	13776880	Come on.
13778880	13780880	Besides, nothing's exciting to happen to me since I went up with that kite.
13781880	13783880	This is so exciting.
13783880	13788880	Ha, sleeping only through a set of four that I must cram in one adventure first.
13788880	13791880	This is what we'll do. I grabbed the witch and while she's helpless,
13791880	13793880	you two grab the girl and whisk her away to safety.
13793880	13797880	That sounds great, but we don't know if she is a witch, little Mai.
13797880	13802880	If we grab her and she isn't a witch, it would be embarrassing and we could all be in trouble.
13802880	13807880	Maybe the witch needed an innocent maiden to try out some potions to experiment on her.
13807880	13809880	Maybe, let's find out.
13809880	13810880	How do we find out?
13810880	13812880	By snooping around, I suppose.
13812880	13816880	I hope you'll think of something a bit better than that before we get there.
13816880	13821880	Let's hide as close to the house as we can and then ask the girl as soon as she comes out.
13822880	13825880	And what if she doesn't come out, Snuffkin?
13825880	13827880	Then we'll improvise, little Mai.
13827880	13830880	So this is the famous plan by the great Snuffkin.
13830880	13835880	Look, if she doesn't come out of the house, we'll just go up and knock on the door.
13836880	13841880	Once we're inside, I'm sure we'll be able to tell what's really what.
13841880	13844880	I don't think it's a very good idea.
13844880	13846880	What if she catches us, Bell?
13846880	13850880	Little Mai will wait outside and if we don't come out, she can run back to Moomin Valley for help.
13850880	13854880	That's fine, but Moomin can wait outside and I'll search the house.
13854880	13858880	Oh no, little Mai, you can wait outside and I will search the house.
13858880	13859880	Let's do it this way.
13859880	13862880	You stay outside and if we get caught, try to free us.
13862880	13866880	And run for help as quickly as you can only if you can't.
13866880	13867880	Is that okay?
13867880	13871880	Hmm, that means if you're in trouble, your lives will be in my hands.
13871880	13872880	That's right, little Mai.
13872880	13874880	I don't like this out of this.
13874880	13877880	I'm not sure I want little Mai to be my last hope.
13877880	13880880	Well, I wouldn't now but anyone who doesn't trust me, that's for sure.
13880880	13881880	Here's that?
13881880	13882880	See what I mean?
13882880	13884880	Be quiet.
13885880	13886880	There's a house.
13892880	13893880	Look at this.
13893880	13897880	It's very quiet, do you think there's anybody home?
13897880	13899880	I don't know, let's wait a while and see.
13899880	13902880	Do we have to stay absolutely still?
13902880	13903880	But of course we do.
13903880	13907880	We'll feel extremely silly if the house is empty.
13907880	13909880	They disappeared.
13909880	13911880	They could have told us where they were going.
13911880	13912880	I'm sure I don't care.
13912880	13914880	Little Mai went too, I think.
13914880	13917880	She's betrayed us, that's just like her.
13917880	13920880	Don't worry, I've got a pretty good idea where they were heading for.
13920880	13922880	You know where they've gone?
13922880	13924880	Why didn't you tell me, where are they?
13924880	13927880	They've gone to the forest of witches.
13927880	13928880	What?
13928880	13931880	They've gone to see whether the woman we met yesterday is a real witch.
13931880	13933880	A real one?
13933880	13935880	Why don't we go there too?
13935880	13938880	I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find my way, Sniff.
13938880	13940880	What is it?
13940880	13943880	I don't know, it's my stomach, I better lie down.
13943880	13947880	Oh, it's very painful.
13948880	13952880	Oh, how much longer we can have to stay here like this.
13952880	13955880	This adventure isn't the least bit exciting.
13955880	13957880	Well, let's wait a little bit longer.
13957880	13960880	Be quiet, at least we know the girl is definitely in there.
13960880	13963880	No, we don't, she might be out, she could be anywhere.
13963880	13966880	I know that's possible, but I don't think so.
13971880	13973880	She's getting some water.
13973880	13976880	As I thought, that bitch is working her to the bone.
13976880	13978880	Hey, little boy.
13978880	13980880	She's following that girl.
13980880	13983880	You go with her, moving and find out as much as you possibly can about what's going on.
13983880	13985880	I'll watch the house.
13985880	13987880	Right.
13988880	13990880	Hey, wait for me.
14006880	14009880	Oh.
14036880	14039880	Oh.
14039880	14044880	If you're looking for Alicia, she's out.
14069880	14070880	Oh, stop.
14070880	14071880	Listen.
14071880	14073880	Wait and see.
14073880	14075880	I wasn't doing anything wrong.
14075880	14078880	Why did you try to run away then?
14083880	14085880	Oh, I'll help you with that.
14085880	14086880	So will I.
14086880	14087880	How kind of you.
14087880	14089880	It is a bit heavy to carry, you know.
14089880	14091880	I think I remember your name.
14091880	14092880	Is it Alicia?
14092880	14093880	Yes, it is.
14093880	14095880	I'm so glad you remembered it.
14095880	14096880	My name is Lulman.
14096880	14097880	And I'm Lulman.
14097880	14100880	What are you doing here in the forest of witches?
14100880	14104880	Well, to be perfectly honest, we came because we were rather worried about you.
14104880	14106880	What about me? Why is that?
14106880	14109880	Is that a woman really your grandmother?
14109880	14110880	Of course.
14110880	14111880	You're quite sure?
14111880	14112880	Yes, of course.
14112880	14114880	She's my mother's mother.
14114880	14115880	Why do you ask?
14115880	14117880	Well, don't you know?
14117880	14118880	He's trying to ask.
14118880	14119880	That's cool.
14119880	14122880	Well, maybe your grandmother is a witch.
14122880	14123880	Yes, she is.
14123880	14124880	Of course.
14124880	14126880	Oh, I'm sorry.
14126880	14128880	I was a bit taken aback.
14128880	14131880	You don't mind about your grandmother being a real witch?
14131880	14132880	Oh, no.
14132880	14133880	That's what she is.
14133880	14134880	I was husband.
14134880	14137880	I'm going to be one, two, and I'm grown up.
14137880	14138880	Oh, no.
14138880	14139880	You couldn't.
14139880	14141880	Well, you don't look anything like one.
14141880	14143880	Well, that's because I'm not one yet.
14143880	14146880	When you're born into a witch family, that's what you become.
14146880	14148880	But it's not that easy, you know.
14148880	14150880	Oh, this is too much.
14150880	14151880	Now, tell me.
14151880	14154880	What are you doing here in the forest of witches?
14154880	14156880	You don't sound like a witch.
14156880	14157880	Oh, really?
14157880	14159880	What do witches sound like?
14159880	14162880	Well, to be honest, you're the first one I've ever met in my whole life.
14162880	14165880	I'm sure that's just what you think, young man.
14165880	14168880	Is it true that the nice girl is really your granddaughter?
14168880	14169880	Certainly.
14169880	14171880	A very promising young girl.
14171880	14175880	Honest and hardworking, and with a lot of training, she will make an excellent witch someday.
14175880	14178880	But how can you possibly turn such a sweet girl into a witch?
14178880	14181880	The sweetest girls make the best witches.
14181880	14183880	Hello, didn't know you were back, grandma.
14183880	14185880	Thank you for getting the water, Alicia.
14185880	14187880	Oh, who's that?
14187880	14188880	I don't know.
14188880	14192880	Some naive young man ought to rescue a damsel in distress now.
14192880	14194880	I remember you, your snuffkin.
14194880	14195880	Yes.
14198880	14200880	Your friend's snuffkins in here.
14200880	14201880	Why don't you come in, too?
14201880	14202880	In the house?
14202880	14203880	Really?
14203880	14205880	He's brought friends with him, hasn't he?
14205880	14207880	Self-killed.
14207880	14209880	Whatever they don't do to you.
14209880	14211880	I'll take care of that.
14211880	14212880	Wait a second.
14212880	14213880	I'll do it for you.
14213880	14214880	I'll fix it.
14220880	14221880	Wait.
14221880	14222880	I'm gonna need you again.
14222880	14223880	Where are you going?
14223880	14226880	I don't think that snake ever got bitten before.
14226880	14228880	I'll get another.
14228880	14229880	I'm very curious.
14229880	14231880	Why are you free here, huh?
14231880	14235880	They came all the way from Moomin Valley because they were really worried about me, grandma.
14235880	14237880	Weren't about you?
14237880	14238880	Yes.
14238880	14239880	They thought you might be nasty to me.
14239880	14242880	So they came all this way to see if I needed help.
14242880	14244880	This always happens.
14244880	14249880	People treat witches as if they weren't ordinary, respectable, responsible citizens.
14249880	14251880	No, no, we're very sorry.
14251880	14252880	We realize.
14252880	14257880	She's quite okay, and she's most welcome to visit us in Moomin Valley at any time.
14257880	14258880	Isn't she snuffkin?
14258880	14259880	Yes, certainly.
14260880	14261880	What?
14261880	14263880	You said you'd visit these people?
14263880	14264880	Oh, yes.
14264880	14268880	I thought I'd go over there sometimes after I'd finished with my homework, of course.
14268880	14270880	I would never leave my studies half done.
14270880	14277880	Sorry, Alicia, but if you ever want to become a good witch, you mustn't see any ordinary mortals.
14277880	14278880	Oh, why not?
14278880	14281880	I've only just become friends with them, grandma, please.
14281880	14282880	I know.
14282880	14286880	Why don't I wait a year and study to be a witch next year?
14286880	14287880	Alicia.
14290880	14292880	This is family business.
14292880	14295880	So if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you were to leave.
14296880	14299880	I'd like you to go immediately if you please.
14310880	14312880	It's snowing.
14313880	14319880	Well, she certainly won't be able to visit us if Moomin Valley is buried in snow, so we might never see her again.
14319880	14321880	No, that's right.
14321880	14324880	And you'll be leaving soon, won't you, snuffkin?
14325880	14329880	Winter had come once again to Moomin Valley.
14341880	14348880	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
14348880	14355880	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
14355880	14359880	They're always happy and goes at play.
14359880	14363880	The Moons are having fun day after day.
14363880	14366880	The Moons.
14366880	14370880	The Moons.
14370880	14376880	The Moons.
14378880	14384880	The Moons.
14384880	14389880	The Moons.
14389880	14393880	The Moons.
14393880	14396880	The Moons.
14396880	14399880	The Moons.
14399880	14402880	Here they are for one and all.
14402880	14405880	The Moons are about to call.
14405880	14408480	I wanna sit down here with me
14408480	14411080	Therefore you aren't your TV
14411080	14413880	They are the movements
14413880	14416880	They are the movements
14416880	14420080	So come with me, give me your hand
14420080	14423080	I'll take you up to a moment land
14423080	14425880	You can fly just like a bird
14425880	14428280	Sing the best song ever
14428280	14431280	There were the movements
14431280	14434280	There were the movements
14434280	14437080	There were the movements
14437080	14440080	There were the movements
14440080	14442880	There were the movements
14442880	14449880	There were the movements
14449880	14452880	The snow was getting thicker on the ground
14452880	14458880	and it was high time for the movements to start hibernating
14464280	14471280	I'm so glad I've come to see you today instead of leaving a town
14471280	14475280	I'm so glad I've come to see you today
14475280	14477280	Instead of leaving a town
14477280	14479280	What are you doing, my man?
14479280	14480280	Alicia!
14480280	14482280	What are you doing with these pine needles?
14482280	14484280	That's what we always eat before we hibernate
14484280	14485280	Nobody knows why
14485280	14487280	So you're gonna start hibernating
14487280	14489280	Yes tonight
14489280	14490280	Oh, that's soon?
14490280	14491280	Yes
14491280	14493280	I'm so glad I've come to see you today
14493280	14497280	Instead of leaving until tomorrow then
14497280	14500280	I must say you came on just the right day, Alicia
14500280	14503280	We usually have a small party the night we start hibernating
14503280	14505280	and you've arrived just in time
14505280	14508280	Oh, you mean I can stay for that woman, mama?
14508280	14511280	And by the way, Alicia is a matter of interest
14511280	14513280	It's the witch, sorry, your grandmother
14513280	14514280	I mean, know that you're here?
14514280	14516280	No, I'm afraid I didn't tell her
14516280	14518280	Better for grownups not to know too much
14518280	14520280	Oh, do you say you're right?
14520280	14523280	I'm afraid she's not very happy for me to come here to Moomin Valley
14523280	14525280	Oh, I have a lot my dear
14525280	14528280	I guess she's afraid that if I start coming here to play
14528280	14531280	I shall lose interest in studying hard at my witchcraft
14531280	14534280	Oh, but you've got a very long time to go before you're a witch
14534280	14538280	It takes anything between five to seven years nowadays
14538280	14541280	Are you really sure that's what you want to be, Alicia?
14541280	14543280	Study something out
14543280	14544280	But I want to be a witch
14544280	14547280	Perhaps you don't know, but witches aren't terribly popular
14548280	14550280	Yes, I do, but I won't be like that
14550280	14551280	I'll be popular
14554280	14556280	Hey, Snuffkin!
14559280	14561280	You're off to the moments?
14561280	14562280	Yes
14563280	14565280	I thought you'd gone south already
14565280	14568280	Last winter you'd gone before the snow started
14568280	14570280	Not this year, I promised Moomin
14570280	14571280	Promise
14571280	14574280	I promised not to leave Moomin Valley until he went into hibernation
14578280	14580280	Everybody seems to be here
14580280	14582280	And somebody knew
14582280	14583280	Who's that?
14583280	14584280	Half a guess
14584280	14585280	Hmm
14585280	14588280	Ah, very well then, it's Alicia, that's my guess
14588280	14590280	Ah, how did you know?
14590280	14591280	What?
14591280	14592280	I'm right?
14592280	14595280	Yes, you are, but I think you peaked and saw her earlier on
14595280	14598280	I didn't, I just named somebody I thought couldn't be here
14598280	14599280	Clever, huh?
14599280	14601280	Well, she just happened to stop by
14601280	14602280	She's with papa
14602280	14604280	Who's showing her around the house
14604280	14606280	Is the witch here, too?
14606280	14609280	No, she didn't tell the witch she was coming here
14609280	14611280	Just as well, thank goodness
14614280	14616280	Ah, it's you, Snuffkin
14616280	14619280	I finally came over, I told you I would
14619280	14620280	Hi
14620280	14621280	Remember our friend here?
14621280	14623280	He's called Sniff
14623280	14625280	Hi, how do you do Sniff?
14625280	14630280	Well, you aren't gonna use your magic to cast any spells and stuff, are you?
14630280	14632280	No
14637280	14641280	Actually, they didn't need just pine needles for dinner that evening
14641280	14643280	They had lots of other nice things, too
14643280	14645280	All cooked by Mum and Mama
14645280	14648280	Snuffkin, I'd like to say how story I am
14648280	14649280	Why?
14649280	14653280	I persuaded you to stay on here instead of going south as you'd planned
14653280	14654280	I'm leaving tomorrow
14654280	14657280	But the snow is quite deep
14657280	14659280	Don't worry, I'm used to deep snow
14659280	14663280	I'm just worried Alicia will find it hard to get home in this
14663280	14668280	Well, she could spell the night here, but of course tomorrow will be asleep for the winter, so...
14672280	14673280	Huh?
14673280	14675280	Hmm, someone's at the door
14675280	14677280	I'll see who it is
14683280	14685280	Oh, hello, how are you?
14687280	14689280	Hello indeed, my young man
14689280	14691280	My granddaughter is here, isn't she?
14692280	14694280	Who is it that moment?
14694280	14696280	Oh, my dear
14696280	14698280	You must be Mum and Papa
14702280	14704280	Now, you listen to me, Mum and Papa
14704280	14708280	I don't want my granddaughter playing with your children under any circumstances
14708280	14710280	Do I make myself quite clear?
14710280	14712280	But Alicia likes playing with us
14712280	14713280	Grandma!
14713280	14714280	We're leaving
14714280	14716280	Can't I stay a little longer?
14716280	14719280	Hello, you're most welcome to stay and have dinner with us
14719280	14721280	Don't you know I'm a witch?
14721280	14723280	I can't eat that sort of baby food
14723280	14725280	Alicia quite likes the food
14725280	14728280	The pine needles look okay, the rest is yucky
14728280	14729280	Come, Alicia
14729280	14730280	Please, let me stay, Grandma
14730280	14732280	Certainly not, young lady
14732280	14735280	I've told you before, which is never mixed with people like this
14735280	14737280	And that goes for novice, which is as well
14737280	14738280	Never
14738280	14740280	But they're nice, they're really our Grandma
14740280	14742280	And I told you, that's the trouble
14742280	14745280	They are disgustingly, signally good
14746280	14749280	You will hear a lot more about this when we get home
14749280	14751280	Come on now
14751280	14755280	It's really cold out here, and there's a lot more snow on the way
14756280	14758280	All right, I'm coming, Grandma
14758280	14759280	Coming
14759280	14760280	Oh, thank you
14760280	14762280	Mum and Papa
14762280	14763280	Yeah
14763280	14765280	We understand each other now, don't we?
14765280	14767280	I'm sure you understand me
14767280	14768280	Never mind about that
14768280	14772280	You and your whole family are never to speak to my granddaughter again
14772280	14774280	Is that understood?
14774280	14776280	But Grandma
14776280	14779280	Mind what I say over a vengeance of touch will come upon you
14779280	14781280	Or even the revenge of a serious
14781280	14784280	If you think cheap threats like that impress Mum and Papa
14784280	14786280	You're making a grave mistake
14786280	14789280	Mum and Papa is a highly educated gentleman
14789280	14792280	But I am a witch with three diplomas
14792280	14793280	Maybe so
14793280	14797280	But tell me, how can three diplomas help you to get home with all this snow
14797280	14800280	Ha, child's play to an accredited witch
14800280	14802280	Come, Alicia
14803280	14807280	I've never seen one of these before, a little pep square
14807280	14810280	Is that really a witch's broom?
14810280	14811280	Well, I never
14811280	14813280	Let's go and see
14813280	14817280	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
14817280	14818280	I'm ready!
14818280	14819280	Cold on died, Alicia
14819280	14822280	Okay, can you both ride on that broom?
14822280	14826280	It looks pretty scrappy to me, could fall to pieces, any minute
14826280	14829280	Do drive slowly in this weather
14829280	14831280	Oh, please don't fall off, Alicia
14831280	14833280	But terrible chatterboxes you all are
14833280	14835280	Please keep quiet all of you
14836280	14838280	Are you ready, girl?
14838280	14839280	Yeah
14839280	14841280	Bet they'll never be able to take off
14841280	14842280	Huh?
14842280	14849280	Ahhh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
14855280	14857280	This is nó!
14857280	14858280	Oh, this is new at fall
14858280	14859280	Come on!
14865640	14867000	What is it, Grandma?
14867000	14868000	Nothing!
14868000	14869000	Oh!
14869840	14870840	Ah!
14872120	14873840	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
14873840	14875840	Just what I thought, they're too heavy!
14876840	14879840	Listen, I could take Alicia's place, I'm not too heavy!
14880600	14883000	Don't worry, I'm happy to walk home, Grandma!
14883000	14884920	Don't be so ridiculous, child!
14884920	14886840	You can't walk home in all this snow!
14886840	14887720	You'll never make it!
14887720	14889400	Only I had some skis!
14889400	14891400	Come on, climb aboard!
14891400	14892600	I'll try another spell!
14893640	14896600	Grandma, are you worried because all those people are watching you?
14896600	14897400	Shut up!
14897400	14899000	And help me say the magic spell!
14901640	14902440	Go ahead!
14912600	14913800	They're doing it!
14913800	14914600	They're doing it!
14917880	14919440	Yeah, yeah!
14926840	14927560	Oh.
14929480	14931040	Where do we go?
14938320	14939560	Oh!
14941800	14942600	Hey!
14942600	14944520	Where's the magic spell?
14944520	14946200	You are in the water, good bye!
14947720	14950220	Oh, stop it, Mama!
14951220	14954720	She may have three diplomas, but I don't think she's very good, Mama.
14954720	14957720	I wish they'd sing to the ground so I could fly that room.
14957720	14960720	Guess they're all right now, Mum and Papa.
14960720	14962720	Let's go back to our dinner.
14970720	14974720	Oh, I forgot to thank them for asking me to stand at dinner.
14974720	14978720	Thank them indeed. I don't think you're cut out to be a witch.
14978720	14980720	Oh, but Grandma, I don't want to be one.
14980720	14984720	Well, I'm quite happy to help, but the path will certainly be a difficult one.
14984720	14986720	Oh? Oh.
14986720	14988720	Mama!
15005720	15007720	Oh.
15021720	15025720	With Alessia and the witch gone home to the Valley of the Witches,
15025720	15030720	Snuffkin departed for his trip south, and the Moomins went into hibernation.
15034720	15049720	They certainly would have slept till the beginning of the spring, as usual, but this year.
15057720	15061720	Quite unexpectedly, something happened.
15064720	15067720	Go away, Master!
15067720	15070720	Let's get out.
15076720	15079720	Scums!
15079720	15083720	Go away!
15084720	15086720	Oh.
15086720	15088720	G-
15088720	15090720	Oh.
15090720	15092720	Huh?
15092720	15117720	There's someone at the window.
15117720	15121720	There's someone at the window.
15122720	15131720	It's frozen shut.
15139720	15142720	Hey, why did you wake me up?
15142720	15144720	Well, you shouldn't be asleep.
15144720	15146720	Didn't you know Christmas is coming?
15146720	15149720	It's tomorrow, so there's not a minute to be lost.
15149720	15151720	Christmas is coming tomorrow.
15151720	15153720	But who on earth is that?
15153720	15155720	Why? Who is Christmas?
15155720	15157720	This isn't a joke moment.
15157720	15159720	I'm not in the least ready.
15159720	15161720	I've lost my mittens and Christmas is coming
15161720	15163720	and I haven't got a fir tree yet.
15163720	15166720	A fir tree, I really must get a fir tree.
15169720	15170720	How very odd.
15170720	15172720	Why a fir tree?
15172720	15174720	Hey!
15174720	15176720	Why?
15176720	15178720	Oh, what's that moment?
15180720	15184720	Well, Christmas is almost coming and we don't have a fir tree yet.
15184720	15186720	Christmas?
15186720	15187720	Hmm.
15187720	15189720	Did you say Christmas is coming?
15189720	15191720	Yes, and before that, one must have a fir tree.
15191720	15193720	What's this about a fir tree?
15193720	15197720	Well, you need one to protect ourselves against this Christmas person, Mumma.
15197720	15200720	I'm not really quite clear on that point.
15200720	15203720	But there's something awful that has to be kept away, right?
15204720	15206720	Ah, keep it up.
15206720	15208720	I better go get a fir tree.
15222720	15225720	Ha, about the time you move in, Scotta.
15225720	15227720	How are you going to see?
15227720	15229720	Pretty good fir tree, Dad.
15230720	15232720	Well, thank you, Gavsie.
15232720	15234720	But could you tell me something?
15234720	15236720	What is one supposed to do with it?
15238720	15240720	I'm really moving, Papa.
15240720	15243720	The way you can joke with such a straight face.
15243720	15244720	Joke?
15244720	15245720	Eh?
15245720	15249720	Love to stay, but I haven't even finished cooking yet.
15252720	15253720	I wasn't joking.
15253720	15255720	No one believe me, either.
15260720	15263720	Would you like a little more, young man?
15263720	15264720	No, thank you very much.
15264720	15266720	I'm really nice and warm again now.
15266720	15270720	I saw a moment, Papa, and a moment bring up a big tree.
15270720	15272720	But what is one supposed to do with it?
15272720	15273720	Don't you know?
15273720	15275720	No.
15275720	15278720	Why, you decorate it as beautifully as you can.
15278720	15279720	Really?
15283720	15286720	Christmas is coming, so I better be off.
15286720	15288720	Everyone's talking of Christmas.
15288720	15289720	I know.
15289720	15291720	I've got a long way to go.
15293720	15295720	Take care, dear.
15301720	15302720	Hello.
15302720	15303720	Hello.
15306720	15308720	Bye-bye!
15308720	15309720	Bye-bye!
15309720	15311720	Goodbye.
15312720	15313720	Who was that?
15313720	15314720	I don't know.
15314720	15317720	He was in a hurry to get somewhere before Christmas.
15317720	15319720	Oh, I gave him some tea.
15319720	15320720	That was nice.
15320720	15323720	And he told us what to do with the fir tree.
15323720	15324720	What did he say?
15324720	15326720	To decorate it beautifully.
15326720	15329720	Decorate it, but why should we do that, Mama?
15329720	15333720	I guess we must decorate the tree to make sure we keep Christmas happy.
15333720	15334720	Yes, you're right.
15334720	15336720	We'd better start doing it right away.
15336720	15339720	Yes, I'm sure there's not a moment to lose.
15339720	15340720	No.
15340720	15341720	Mama?
15341720	15342720	Yes, dear.
15342720	15345720	They also say we have to cook lots of food for Christmas.
15345720	15346720	Goodness.
15346720	15348720	Well, at least he won't be eating us then.
15357720	15358720	Here.
15358720	15360720	And thank you, Snorkmaid.
15360720	15364720	Oh, the ship means rather a rock to me.
15364720	15366720	It will look fantastic on the tree, Papa.
15366720	15367720	Yes, dear.
15367720	15368720	I suppose you're right.
15369720	15375720	Oh, why don't we put this at the top?
15375720	15377720	This is Mars.
15377720	15380720	Don't worry.
15380720	15384720	Mmm, that looks beautiful.
15384720	15387720	Listen, everybody.
15387720	15391720	I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas, too.
15391720	15392720	Really?
15393720	15397720	I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas, too.
15397720	15399720	Really, Mama?
15399720	15402720	I don't wonder what this Christmas will be like.
15402720	15406720	What if it's an awful greedy, beastly monster like the grove?
15406720	15407720	Don't worry, Snorkmaid.
15407720	15410720	We'll give him lots of presents and stuff him full of food.
15415720	15418720	Have you thought of any presents for Christmas yet?
15418720	15420720	I don't know what to give him.
15420720	15422720	Look, a seashell.
15422720	15424720	Oh, that's a beauty.
15427720	15430720	Oh, look, Mama, what I got for Christmas.
15430720	15433720	I'm going to give him a pretty lure for fishing.
15433720	15435720	I'm giving him this book.
15435720	15436720	Great presents.
15436720	15440720	I'm sure he'll be very happy with the moment family and not Thomas at all.
15451720	15453720	I think Christmas will come any moment now.
15453720	15455720	So do I.
15455720	15456720	Oh, dear.
15456720	15459720	I do hope he likes my pumpkin pie.
15459720	15460720	He will.
15460720	15463720	Imagine everyone in Moomin Valley being frightened.
15463720	15464720	Mmm.
15474720	15475720	Are you sleepy?
15475720	15476720	Yes, I am.
15476720	15479720	I can't stay this scared for much longer.
15480720	15483720	Better come before all the food freezes.
15483720	15484720	Oh.
15487720	15488720	He's coming.
15491720	15495720	I never thought Christmas could be that small.
15495720	15497720	Merry Christmas.
15497720	15500720	Merry Christmas. Is that what he is?
15500720	15502720	Well, it's just what you say.
15502720	15506720	All of my life I have dreamed of seeing all this up close, honestly.
15507720	15510720	I never really thought a Christmas tree could be this beautiful.
15510720	15512720	Brought my friends, too.
15512720	15514720	You're all very welcome.
15514720	15516720	Oh, thank you.
15516720	15517720	Hear that, everybody?
15517720	15519720	We're all very welcome.
15519720	15520720	Woo!
15520720	15521720	Man, let's get him.
15521720	15523720	There's some wonderful things here.
15523720	15524720	Yeah!
15526720	15528720	Oh, what a lot of food you've made.
15528720	15531720	Yes, all the food there is for Christmas.
15531720	15533720	And are those real presents?
15533720	15535720	They are.
15535720	15539720	All of my life, I've sort of wondered about those things called presents.
15539720	15542720	Papa, I don't think these creatures are Christmas.
15542720	15544720	Neither do I.
15552720	15554720	You look sleepy.
15554720	15555720	I am.
15555720	15558720	Must be well past midnight.
15558720	15561720	What is Christmas doing, Mama?
15561720	15563720	Aren't you sleepy, too, little ones?
15563720	15567720	Sleepy with a wonderful Christmas tree like this to look at.
15570720	15571720	Hey, Papa.
15571720	15572720	What is it?
15572720	15575720	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
15575720	15576720	Maybe.
15578720	15581720	Nobody can get really angry this late at night.
15581720	15585720	Surely we'll close the doors and perhaps we'll be safe inside.
15585720	15587720	I'm sure you're right.
15587720	15588720	Listen, my friends.
15588720	15591720	We'd like to give you the tree and the food and the presents.
15592720	15593720	What?
15593720	15594720	All of this?
15594720	15595720	For us?
15595720	15597720	Yes, we want to sleep.
15597720	15599720	We're far more sleepy than scared.
15603720	15604720	Snortman?
15604720	15606720	Oh, I see here yet.
15606720	15609720	No, but we decided to go back to hibernating.
15610720	15611720	Bye-bye.
15628720	15631720	I thought Christmas tree should have a star on top.
15631720	15634720	I don't think it makes any difference, you know?
15634720	15637720	A nice rose is just as good as a star.
15637720	15638720	Look at that!
15661720	15664720	And apparently it didn't make any difference at all.
15664720	15667720	Because the Moonman family slept as peacefully as ever,
15667720	15673720	all through the night, without Christmas, coming anywhere near them.
15673720	15676720	So probably he went someplace else.
15678720	15685720	They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.
15685720	15693720	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
15693720	15696720	They're always happy and goes at play.
15696720	15700720	The Moons are having fun day after day.
15700720	15703720	The Moons.
15703720	15706720	The Moons.
15706720	15708720	The Moons.
15708720	15711720	The Moons.
15723720	15726720	The Moons.
15754720	15757720	So come with me, give me your hand.
15757720	15760720	I'll take you up to a moment land.
15760720	15763720	You can fly just like a bird.
15763720	15765720	Sing that song ever.
15765720	15768720	There were the movements.
15768720	15771720	There were the movements.
15771720	15774720	There were the movements.
15774720	15777720	There were the movements.
15777720	15780720	There were the movements.
15780720	15783720	There were the movements.
15783720	15786720	There were the movements.
15801720	15803720	During his long winter sleep,
15803720	15806720	Moonman had a dream.
15810720	15814720	And strangely enough, he dreamt that he was sleeping.
15814720	15816720	Moonman.
15816720	15818720	Moonman.
15818720	15821720	Huh?
15824720	15826720	Alicia.
15826720	15827720	Alicia.
15827720	15830720	Wow, you can fly on the broomstick now.
15830720	15833720	Right, I'm a fully fledged witch now, Moonman.
15833720	15836720	Wait, give me a ride, Alicia.
15836720	15837720	Can't do that.
15837720	15839720	Oh, don't be mean, Alicia.
15839720	15842720	Because someone's already riding with me.
15842720	15844720	Man, it's me.
15844720	15845720	Little boy.
15845720	15848720	Would you mind if we went a little higher, Alicia?
15848720	15850720	Sure.
15850720	15852720	Oh, wow, higher, Alicia.
15852720	15854720	Keep going.
15856720	15858720	Please, listen.
15858720	15859720	Come back.
15859720	15861720	Please, give me a ride, Alicia.
15861720	15863720	Here you go.
15875720	15879720	Oh, thank you, Moonman.
15879720	15882720	Will you give me a ride now?
15882720	15884720	Come on now.
15889720	15891720	Moonman.
15899720	15902720	Moonman, Val, he's really beautiful from up here.
15902720	15905720	Yes, lovely.
15905720	15907720	Oh, Alicia, be careful.
15907720	15908720	Don't do things like that.
15908720	15909720	What are you talking about?
15909720	15911720	We're not doing anything, Moonman.
15911720	15913720	A little boy, it's you again.
15913720	15916720	No wonder the broom is shaking so much.
15916720	15917720	How do you like it?
15917720	15919720	I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?
15919720	15922720	Where did you get this broom from, little boy?
15922720	15924720	I borrowed it from the witch.
15924720	15925720	I borrowed it.
15925720	15926720	For a while.
15926720	15928720	That's the witch, isn't it?
15928720	15929720	Looks like it.
15929720	15931720	Maybe we better get out of here.
15931720	15932720	You're right.
15932720	15933720	Stop.
15933720	15934720	You two little thieves.
15934720	15936720	Give me back my broom at once.
15936720	15937720	No.
15937720	15938720	Yeah.
15938720	15939720	You have your own broom.
15939720	15941720	You witches should learn how to share.
15941720	15943720	But there's no one who's just a spare.
15943720	15945720	I want my veil from back right now.
15945720	15946720	Find yours, keepers.
15946720	15947720	It's my broom.
15947720	15948720	Cut that a broom.
15948720	15949720	Huh.
15949720	15951720	Why don't you take a closer look at it?
15951720	15952720	That's not a broom.
15952720	15953720	What do you mean?
15953720	15954720	This is not a broom.
15954720	15955720	Oh.
15955720	15956720	Oh.
15956720	15957720	Hey.
15957720	15958720	Oh.
15958720	15959720	Oh.
15959720	15960720	Oh.
15960720	15961720	Oh.
15961720	15962720	Oh.
15962720	15963720	Oh.
15963720	15964720	Oh.
15964720	15965720	Oh.
15965720	15966720	Oh.
15966720	15967720	Oh.
15967720	15968720	Oh.
15968720	15969720	Oh.
15969720	15970720	Oh.
15970720	15971720	Oh.
15971720	15972720	Oh.
15972720	15973720	Oh.
15973720	15974720	Oh.
15974720	15975720	I must have been dreaming.
15975720	15977720	You were yelling out loud.
15977720	15978720	Oh.
15978720	15979720	I'm so sorry.
15979720	15983720	I didn't mean to wake you up, Snorkman.
15983720	15993720	Can you see anything?
15993720	15994720	Only snow.
15994720	15995720	Everything's so light.
15995720	15996720	Yes.
15996720	15997720	The morning's up.
15997720	15998720	Oh.
15998720	15999720	What an airy light.
15999720	16000720	Yes.
16000720	16001720	Spring hasn't arrived yet.
16001720	16002720	Has it?
16002720	16003720	Yes.
16003720	16005720	Everybody else is still asleep then?
16005720	16006720	Yes.
16006720	16007720	Most of them anyway.
16007720	16009720	Wonder if my brother's still up.
16009720	16014800	Well, he did say before we started hyprinating, he wanted to finish his blueprints before spring
16014800	16015800	if he could.
16015800	16017720	I hope he'll succeed this time.
16017720	16018720	When he go out.
16018720	16019720	Huh?
16019720	16022720	Outside just to see what the snow looks like.
16022720	16023720	Oh, no.
16023720	16026720	I don't really feel like it.
16026720	16027720	It's nice and warm here.
16027720	16031720	Why don't we sleep till spring like the others?
16031720	16035720	Spring is still a long way off.
16035720	16037720	I guess you're right.
16037720	16040720	It is nice and warm in here.
16054720	16056720	It's delicious.
16056720	16059720	Chocolate cakes, my favorite.
16060720	16062720	Did you say something, snorkeweider?
16062720	16065720	I'm so very hungry, moment.
16071720	16074720	Your mother's raspberry juice is really the best.
16074720	16075720	It is, isn't it?
16075720	16077720	Everybody said that last winter, too.
16077720	16078720	Hey, moment.
16078720	16079720	Yeah?
16079720	16080720	I have a funny feeling.
16080720	16082720	Someone is watching us and I don't like you.
16082720	16083720	One little bit.
16083720	16085720	Moment, Papa, could explain it.
16085720	16086720	I'm sure.
16086720	16087720	Of course, someone's watching.
16087720	16088720	What?
16088720	16089720	But who?
16089720	16090720	And how do you know?
16090720	16091720	Too thick.
16091720	16093720	He told me all about it last winter, snort maiden.
16093720	16095720	She doesn't hibernate, you know?
16095720	16098720	She lives in our bathhouse and watches over us in the winter.
16098720	16102720	She said that many things are too shy to show themselves.
16102720	16104720	Oh, have you seen them yourself?
16104720	16105720	Sort of.
16105720	16107720	Except they were invisible, of course.
16107720	16109720	Like under the sink.
16109720	16111720	Or in the clock, maybe.
16111720	16115720	In the empty fireplace and other dark corners of the room.
16116720	16119720	Did you actually look anywhere for them?
16119720	16120720	Oh, no.
16120720	16121720	They'd be very upset.
16121720	16124720	It's better not to let them know we know where they are.
16124720	16126720	I wonder what these things look like.
16126720	16128720	Some of them look very much like us, too, Tiki said.
16128720	16131720	Old ancestors of ours from way back, she thinks.
16131720	16133720	Some of them look like us, she said.
16133720	16135720	Well, I've never seen them for myself.
16135720	16138720	I wonder if there is good looking as we are.
16138720	16147720	Wouldn't it be a good idea to stay up and wait for the sunrise?
16147720	16149720	A great idea.
16154720	16156720	Now, don't say anything to scare them.
16156720	16160720	But this is one of the movement's ancestors from way back.
16162720	16164720	Is it morning already?
16164720	16165720	Are you sure?
16165720	16166720	I think so.
16166720	16169720	There are no clouds, so why can't we see the sun?
16169720	16173720	I guess maybe the sun doesn't come up at all this time of the year.
16173720	16175720	Mom and I don't like this.
16175720	16178720	I don't like you one little bit.
16178720	16180720	You silly little girl.
16180720	16181720	What do you need this for?
16181720	16182720	Please, grandma.
16182720	16183720	I won't be long.
16183720	16184720	I promise.
16184720	16185720	What are you talking about?
16185720	16187720	Is if you could fly a broom.
16187720	16189720	Get back back to me at once.
16189720	16191720	No, I won't give it back.
16191720	16192720	Now give me back that broom.
16192720	16193720	And don't be silly.
16193720	16196720	How many times from sight tell you you can't go visiting Moomin Valley.
16196720	16198720	But it's so boring here.
16198720	16200720	I want some company, grandma.
16200720	16203720	Come on, broom fly off.
16203720	16205720	Take me to Moomin Valley.
16208720	16211720	Help me up, grandma.
16211720	16212720	Please.
16214720	16215720	All right, my girl.
16215720	16217720	I'll help you up, shall I?
16217720	16223720	I don't believe it.
16223720	16224720	I'm floating.
16224720	16225720	Oh.
16225720	16226720	How far?
16226720	16227720	This is great.
16227720	16228720	Wait.
16228720	16229720	Oh.
16229720	16230720	I'm falling.
16230720	16231720	Oh.
16231720	16232720	Oh.
16232720	16233720	Oh.
16233720	16234720	How about that of these?
16234720	16236720	I don't find them far around here.
16236720	16237720	Oh.
16237720	16239720	Oh, don't bury things again.
16239720	16240720	How about this?
16240720	16242720	I don't find them far around here.
16242720	16243720	Oh.
16243720	16245720	Oh, don't bury things again.
16245720	16247720	How about this?
16247720	16248720	Oh, no.
16248720	16249720	Stop the broom, grandma.
16249720	16250720	Please.
16250720	16251720	Oh.
16251720	16252720	Come on.
16252720	16254720	You wanted to ride on the broom, didn't you?
16254720	16255720	You first saw the bike.
16255720	16256720	Well, here it is.
16256720	16257720	Oh.
16257720	16259720	Oh.
16259720	16260720	Oh, mom.
16260720	16262720	Please, don't.
16262720	16263720	Oh.
16266720	16270720	If you want to learn to fly on this broom, Alicia,
16270720	16274720	then forget all about those dreaded movements and really start studying.
16274720	16276720	It's hard work, you know, young woman.
16276720	16278720	You must learn concentrate.
16284720	16285720	Hey, you up there.
16285720	16287720	Are you making fun of me, too?
16293720	16295720	Oh, I can't climb down there.
16295720	16296720	Of course you can.
16296720	16300720	Even if you fall, you can't hurt yourself on this soft snow.
16300720	16302720	Don't shake the ladder, Moment.
16302720	16303720	This is scary.
16303720	16305720	Slowly does it.
16305720	16307720	Take it easy and don't look down.
16307720	16310720	Maybe going out wasn't such a good idea after all.
16310720	16313720	We can always change our minds and go back to sleep, you know.
16313720	16315720	See, you've made it.
16315720	16319720	It's very cold out here, woman, but I rather like it.
16319720	16320720	Oh.
16320720	16324720	This is the roof over the front door, isn't it?
16324720	16327720	Yes, and everything will be snowed up now to spring.
16327720	16328720	Oh, no.
16328720	16330720	What's happened to our firewood?
16334720	16336720	What's the matter?
16336720	16338720	There's not much wood left in here.
16338720	16340720	Someone else must be burning it.
16340720	16343720	Yes, but who and for what I wonder?
16344720	16346720	I can feel it.
16346720	16347720	We're not alone in this forest.
16347720	16349720	I'm sure someone's watching us.
16349720	16351720	All those winter creatures.
16351720	16353720	No, I don't think it's them.
16357720	16358720	The grog.
16358720	16361720	Goodness me.
16361720	16364720	Look how big she gets in the wintertime.
16364720	16365720	Move in.
16365720	16367720	I'm scared.
16367720	16369720	It'll be all right.
16369720	16370720	Grow.
16370720	16371720	Stop.
16371720	16372720	Right there.
16372720	16376720	Don't come any closer if you please.
16376720	16379720	You're much, much too cold for us, you see.
16379720	16382720	You could freeze a stiff, you know.
16382720	16383720	Oh.
16383720	16386720	Is it possible that you get cold?
16387720	16391720	Is it possible that you get lonely all by yourself?
16391720	16394720	I don't think there's anything we can do to help you know.
16394720	16398720	Not without fur coats and earmuffs and warm gloves anyway.
16398720	16400720	We must go.
16401720	16402720	Oh.
16416720	16418720	Someone's been stealing our firewood.
16418720	16420720	I wonder what they're doing with it.
16420720	16422720	Something bad, there's no doubt about that.
16422720	16425720	Must've been several people did this.
16431720	16432720	Oh.
16442720	16445720	We had a lot of fun here in the summer.
16445720	16446720	Remember?
16446720	16449720	Well, the she is still here round the ice.
16449720	16450720	I hope.
16450720	16452720	Two, Tiki.
16452720	16453720	Two, Tiki.
16455720	16456720	There's no one here.
16456720	16457720	Are you sure?
16457720	16458720	Look for yourself.
16461720	16464720	I know they're invisible, but I'm a shroom ice in here.
16464720	16465720	Hard to tell.
16465720	16467720	Well, things you can't see.
16467720	16469720	Oh.
16469720	16470720	What is it?
16470720	16473720	It felt like something scampering on my back.
16473720	16474720	That's all right.
16474720	16476720	It must be one of the shroom ice.
16480720	16481720	Moman.
16481720	16482720	Moman.
16485720	16487720	Oh, where could he have gone?
16488720	16489720	My goodness.
16489720	16492720	I've never seen anything quite like this before.
16492720	16494720	Hi, it's good to see you.
16494720	16495720	You're right.
16495720	16496720	She's fishing.
16496720	16497720	Hi, two, Tiki.
16497720	16499720	Hello, two, Tiki.
16499720	16501720	So this winter's not made in woke up, too, huh?
16501720	16504720	I walk her up by mistake.
16504720	16507720	You know that spring is still a long way off, don't you?
16507720	16510720	I thought it might be seeing there's no sun at all.
16510720	16513720	But the sun is going to come back tomorrow, Moman.
16513720	16514720	Tomorrow?
16515720	16518720	Snork maiden was so worried about the sun not showing.
16518720	16522720	The sun will rise tomorrow, Moman, but it'll go down very soon.
16522720	16526720	Two Tiki, you know, I think there must be records in Moonwind Valley.
16526720	16527720	Records in winter?
16527720	16531720	There's an enormous pile of firewood up on the hillside.
16531720	16532720	Oh, I know.
16532720	16534720	It took a long time to collect that wood.
16534720	16537720	But some of it belongs to us.
16537720	16538720	Hmm.
16538720	16540720	That doesn't really surprise me, though, Moman.
16540720	16543720	I'm afraid the winner creatures unfairly careful about ownership.
16543720	16546720	They need a lot, so if they see it, they take it.
16546720	16548720	It's for their big winner bonfire.
16548720	16549720	A bonfire?
16549720	16553720	Yes, and now your firewood can take part in the big celebration.
16553720	16557720	They light it every winter to make sure the sun comes back, you know.
16557720	16561720	Oh, you mean otherwise the sun wouldn't come back to Tiki?
16561720	16566720	Well, since they always light it on this day, you don't really know, do you?
16566720	16568720	Tonight you might see the winner creatures.
16568720	16571720	Oh, can we come along as well to Tiki?
16571720	16572720	Yes, you can.
16572720	16575720	If you sit quietly and don't scare them in any way.
16575720	16576720	Wonderful.
16576720	16578720	You're coming along, too, aren't you?
16578720	16579720	Of course.
16579720	16580720	Stop!
16580720	16581720	Help me!
16581720	16583720	Someone shouting for help?
16583720	16584720	Who could it be?
16584720	16585720	Go away!
16585720	16586720	Get away from me!
16586720	16588720	I didn't do it on purpose!
16588720	16590720	I didn't mean any harm!
16590720	16594720	If you don't leave me alone, Grandma will turn you into a toad!
16594720	16596720	Oh, that's so cold!
16596720	16597720	Go away, please!
16597720	16598720	Ah!
16598720	16599720	Ah!
16599720	16600720	Ah!
16600720	16601720	Ah!
16601720	16602720	Ah!
16602720	16603720	Grow!
16603720	16604720	Leave her alone!
16604720	16605720	What are you doing, Grog?
16605720	16606720	Move it!
16606720	16607720	Alicia!
16607720	16608720	No, listen, Grog.
16608720	16609720	Why can't you be nice to her?
16609720	16610720	Alicia is one of my friends.
16610720	16613720	She was just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis.
16613720	16616720	I nearly bumped into her, but I didn't touch her.
16616720	16618720	That's all right, Alicia.
16618720	16619720	Tell me, Grog.
16619720	16620720	Alicia!
16620720	16621720	Alicia!
16621720	16622720	Now listen, Grog.
16622720	16623720	Why can't you be nice to her?
16623720	16624720	Alicia is one of my friends.
16624720	16625720	She was just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis.
16625720	16626720	I nearly bumped into her, but I didn't touch her.
16626720	16627720	Tell me, Grog.
16627720	16628720	What's gotten into you?
16628720	16631720	Why are you so nasty to such a sweet little girl?
16631720	16633720	It isn't like you at all.
16633720	16635720	I must have startled her, I guess.
16635720	16638720	And I did apologize at all, but it made no difference.
16638720	16640720	This is really, very odd.
16640720	16644720	Then I asked if she had seen you, and that's when she started to get mad at me.
16644720	16646720	And she doesn't even know me.
16646720	16648720	It's a mystery.
16648720	16650720	Whatever's the matter with you, Grog.
16650720	16666720	Oh, I was so scared.
16666720	16668720	I'm so glad you've come to see us.
16668720	16670720	So am I, women.
16670720	16673720	Somehow I felt certain you hadn't gone into hibernation yet.
16673720	16676720	But what did your grandmother say?
16676720	16679720	Nothing because I didn't tell her I was coming.
16679720	16681720	Thank you for chasing off that terrible monster.
16681720	16684720	The Grog hasn't actually ever attacked anyone.
16684720	16687720	Well, maybe she doesn't like the look of Alicia.
16687720	16689720	Snork maiden.
16689720	16692720	It's really a mystery to me why the Grog was here at all.
16692720	16695720	She was here looking for a moment no doubt.
16695720	16696720	Was she?
16696720	16699720	He suddenly become very popular.
16699720	16700720	Huh?
16700720	16702720	You don't mean...
16702720	16717720	What's the matter with you?
16717720	16720720	I think the Grog may have fallen in love with you, woman.
16720720	16721720	What?
16721720	16723720	Oh, you can't mean that.
16723720	16725720	Please tell me you're not serious.
16725720	16727720	It's out of the question.
16727720	16729720	It's her ridiculous idea.
16729720	16731720	Don't be so silly.
16748720	16751720	Where's all that drumming noise coming from?
16751720	16753720	From the invisible shroom ice.
16753720	16756720	How long before everybody arrives?
16756720	16759720	Oh, they're here already, moving all around us.
16759720	16760720	They are?
16760720	16761720	Where?
16761720	16762720	I can't see them.
16762720	16764720	Are they really invisible?
16764720	16769720	I can't see them either, but I can feel their presence all around me.
16769720	16772720	But she's been studying witchcraft, hasn't she?
16772720	16777720	I'm sure you and moving will be able to feel their presence quite soon.
16817720	16818720	Oh.
16821720	16825720	I can see some of them looking all over there.
16834720	16837720	I think I see them too, you guys.
16838720	16840720	What the hell?
16843720	16846720	Food, you tell me, why can't we see all of them?
16846720	16848720	Well, we can never see them all.
16848720	16852720	I don't understand how did you know earlier all the shroom ice was playing the drums.
16852720	16856720	I just know because they sometimes play them in the batch house as well.
16856720	16858720	What a wonderful celebration.
16858720	16863720	Isn't it lucky I came over here if I had not have missed a most memorable evening?
16868720	16871720	What's going on here?
16871720	16873720	The grog.
16873720	16874720	What?
16876720	16879720	What's she going?
16879720	16883720	She must be looking for a movement again, I guess.
16883720	16887720	No, I think she just wants to warm herself by the fire.
16887720	16890720	But what's she doing?
16918720	16923720	Well, that's the end of the mid-winter bonfire.
16923720	16927720	Poor grog, she freezes everything she touches.
16927720	16933720	Whatever she sits on, even the hottest bonfire, turns freezing cold in a matter of seconds.
16933720	16937720	Well, at least she's managed to save some of our wood.
16938720	16940720	Oh, no.
16946720	16949720	Hold on tight now, Snorkemaid, and I'll be careful.
16949720	16952720	I can't wait to get into bed.
16952720	16955720	I wanted to stay up until the sun came up again.
16955720	16958720	But I don't know if I could keep awake till then.
16958720	16961720	So long till spring, man, man.
16961720	16963720	Goodbye.
16963720	16966720	And take care, Alicia.
16966720	16970720	I will move in. The moon will light my way back.
16988720	16990720	This time the movements have gone too far.
16990720	16995720	Something must be done. I'll teach them a lesson they'll never forget.
16996720	16998720	They won't get the battle with me.
17000720	17004720	Now, what does the witch mean by teach them a lesson?
17004720	17006720	That sounds very ominous.
17006720	17010720	Let's hope at least that she lets them sleep till next spring.
17017720	17024720	They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.
17024720	17031720	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
17031720	17035720	They're always happy and goes at play.
17035720	17039720	The movements are having fun day after day.
17039720	17042720	The movements.
17042720	17046720	The movements.
17046720	17052720	The movements.
17054720	17061720	The movements.
17076720	17079720	Here they are for one and all.
17079720	17082720	The movements are about to come.
17082720	17085720	They're up down here with me.
17085720	17088720	They're up for you on your TV.
17088720	17091720	They are the movements.
17091720	17094720	They are the movements.
17094720	17097720	So come with me, give me your hand.
17097720	17100720	I'll take you up to a moment land.
17100720	17103720	You can fly just like a bird.
17103720	17106720	Sing that song ever.
17106720	17109720	There were the movements.
17109720	17114720	There were the movements.
17114720	17118720	There were the movements.
17118720	17120720	There were the movements.
17139720	17169720	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
17169720	17198860	heh heh heh, heh heh, heh heh heh heh heh, heh heh, heh heh, heh heh.. The witch has come to Murman Valley..
17198860	17200860	Could you be up to this time?
17200860	17221860	Eldritch Cabalazum!
17221860	17223860	Oh, it's snowing again.
17223860	17225860	I must get a covered brown.
17228860	17256860	The great thaw had come at last.
17256860	17268860	The movement valley.
17268860	17273860	I think I can smell spring.
17273860	17284860	Oh, I've never seen anything like this one before.
17284860	17286860	Hello there, Mr. Hemielun.
17286860	17288860	Hello, Sniff. You're up early this year?
17288860	17292860	Yes. I think I've even beat Momen to it.
17292860	17302860	Is that so? Why are the moments so late this year?
17302860	17307860	Momen, wake up! Spring is here! It's time to wake up!
17308860	17311860	Maybe Snork Maiden's easier to wake up.
17311860	17314860	Snork Maiden!
17314860	17319860	And I thought I was difficult to wake up. I must get closer.
17329860	17331860	What are you doing, Sniff?
17331860	17333860	What am I doing? You can see, can't you?
17333860	17335860	Of course I can, but why are you climbing up that?
17335860	17337860	Momen and Snork Maiden are still asleep.
17337860	17338860	I have to wake them up.
17338860	17342860	Why don't you go this way? It's easier.
17342860	17351860	What do I do now?
17351860	17359860	Funny, even Momen still asleep.
17359860	17363860	Wrong room.
17363860	17373860	Come on, wake up, lazy bones.
17373860	17377860	Momen, spring has come.
17377860	17380860	Well, look at that. Wake up, you sleepyhead.
17380860	17383860	Oh, you really are impossible.
17383860	17389860	Momen, Momen, Momen! This is odd, even for Momen.
17389860	17392860	Open the window, little Mai!
17393860	17402860	Oh, was I scared?
17402860	17404860	Oh, I haven't you opened them up.
17404860	17407860	I've tried, but they won't.
17407860	17411860	You're kidding.
17411860	17414860	No one can resist this little Mai.
17414860	17418860	Wake up, old man. I know you're ticklish.
17419860	17423860	Momen, Momen!
17423860	17425860	I told you so.
17427860	17431860	Momen, come on!
17433860	17435860	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
17435860	17436860	Ah, ah, ah!
17436860	17441860	Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
17441860	17444860	How strange!
17444860	17445860	How sad!
17445860	17447060	Eh? What do you mean?
17447060	17448380	I think...
17448380	17450060	Well, you don't think...
17450060	17451580	You don't think that...
17451580	17452660	It's hard to tell.
17452660	17454420	I was listening for his heartbeat.
17456660	17458060	He's still breathing.
17459660	17461060	And snort-baited?
17462980	17466060	Wake up, you slug-up ass!
17466060	17468060	Snort-baited!
17468460	17469860	They won't wake up.
17470660	17471860	This is strange.
17471860	17473260	Why don't we go and try the other?
17473260	17474660	Yes, why not?
17474660	17477460	I hate it when others are asleep while I'm up.
17477460	17480060	But then I don't like it much the other way around either.
17480060	17481060	Do I sniff?
17484860	17486660	Moment pop up, please wake up!
17486660	17489060	We've tried to wake up moment, but he won't!
17489060	17491260	Wakey-moomin' mama breakfast time!
17491260	17492860	Come on, moment pop up!
17492860	17493860	Wake up!
17495460	17497060	This is no use!
17504860	17508060	Goodness, it seems the moomin's are still hibernating.
17508060	17510060	And so it's snort-baiting.
17510060	17513060	That's odd, she always wakes up even before me.
17513060	17516660	Oh, moment two, but this year it seems to be different!
17516660	17519860	I'll go back home, and I'll come over again in a little while
17519860	17522060	when the moomin' family will have woken up.
17522060	17523460	If they ever do.
17523460	17524460	Huh?
17524460	17527460	We've tried everything to wake them up short of buckets of water
17527460	17529060	and there's no moving them.
17529060	17532260	We've shouted and shook and pinched and tickled and stopped!
17532260	17533460	Oh, dear!
17533460	17535860	It's not just strange, it's ominous!
17535860	17537860	Oh, my, surely not.
17538860	17540660	Hello, everybody!
17541660	17543460	How is everyone?
17543460	17544260	What is it?
17544260	17546060	You all look very scared.
17547460	17548860	Huh?
17548860	17550860	Still hibernating?
17555060	17557460	It's all very strange, have you lint?
17559060	17560260	Moment!
17561460	17562260	See?
17562260	17563860	Yes, indeed!
17566260	17568460	How we can really do is wait and see.
17568460	17570060	I suppose you're right.
17570060	17573460	Don't worry, the days are getting longer all the time now.
17573460	17575860	So the moomin's can't sleep much longer.
17575860	17577860	And snort-baiting?
17577860	17579860	Cheat-tool, of course.
17580460	17583260	Bet you anything, moment wakes up when Snuffkin returns.
17583260	17585260	I think you're right, Sniff.
17586260	17589860	And then, one day about a week later,
17589860	17593460	Snuffkin did come back from his yearly trip south.
17624260	17625260	Snuffkin!
17626860	17627860	Snuffkin!
17632660	17634260	Snuffkin!
17654060	17656060	Snuffkin!
17657060	17658460	Where's the moomin'?
17658460	17659660	He's in bad.
17659660	17661660	Moomin' still asleep.
17662460	17663660	A sleep?
17672260	17674660	They won't wake up no matter what you do.
17675860	17677860	What do you think, Snuffkin?
17677860	17679660	I think they're very sick.
17679660	17681460	That's a possibility.
17681460	17683260	Sleeping sickness, perhaps?
17683260	17685460	It's very difficult to say.
17685460	17687460	To me, though, if you want my honest opinion,
17687460	17690460	I think somebody has cast a very nasty spell on them.
17691460	17692660	A spell?
17692660	17694460	But who would do that?
17694460	17696060	I think I know.
17696060	17697060	Huh?
17697060	17698660	Are you mean the witch?
17698660	17700860	Alice is grandmother, but why?
17700860	17703460	To tell you the truth, I haven't the biggest idea.
17703460	17705460	How do we find out?
17707260	17709260	I'll go to the forest and see her.
17709260	17712260	And if she did cast a spell, do you think she'd tell you?
17712260	17714860	I really don't know, but we have to do something.
17714860	17717660	We can't just leave them sleeping here forever.
17718860	17720260	I'll go with you.
17720260	17723460	I guess I'd better stay here to take care of things.
17723460	17726460	Well, if they suddenly wake up, somebody needs to be here.
17727660	17729260	Snuffkin...
17729260	17729860	Huh?
17729860	17731060	That's him!
17731060	17732060	At last!
17732060	17733060	Moomin'!
17733060	17734260	Moomin'!
17734260	17735260	Moomin'!
17737260	17738860	He's dreaming.
17738860	17741460	Just looking at him makes me feel sleepy.
17743260	17744260	Moomin'!
17744260	17747260	I promise to get this horrible spell cast off for you.
17773260	17774260	Hush!
17778260	17780260	Where are you going?
17780260	17784260	I've done all the chores, even washed out your old potion jars.
17784260	17786260	So, where are you going?
17786260	17787260	Spring is here, Grandma.
17787260	17790260	I thought I'd take some time off to celebrate.
17790260	17792260	But what about your work?
17792260	17795260	I'm just going out for the day, Grandma.
17795260	17797260	And I know where.
17797260	17800260	I only want to know where you're going.
17800260	17802260	And I know where.
17802260	17804260	I only want to see the Moomin's.
17804260	17806260	They're still hibernating.
17806260	17808260	No, they're not. It isn't winter anymore.
17808260	17812260	Winter or spring, I happen to know the Moomin's are still asleep.
17812260	17815260	How could you know what the Moomin's are up to, Grandma?
17815260	17816260	Hm.
17816260	17818260	Oh, which is no everything, my dear girl.
17818260	17819260	Really?
17819260	17821260	Well, I'll go and see.
17821260	17823260	Come here!
17824260	17834260	I have to admit that I can't help being worried about the Moomin's.
17834260	17837260	Their windows are open for the spring.
17837260	17840260	So they can smell the first spring flowers.
17840260	17843260	Well, I suppose I'd miss beginning on.
17848260	17851260	Why didn't you tell them about the witch in the spell?
17851260	17854260	Well, after all, that was just an idea, I got.
17854260	17856260	Ideas can be embarrassing if you were wrong,
17856260	17859260	so don't tell anyone for the time being.
17859260	17860260	All right.
17860260	17861260	I'm going.
17863260	17865260	And I'm leaving, too.
17865260	17866260	Okay.
17872260	17874260	There's Alicia.
17874260	17877260	Hi, everyone. It's me.
17877260	17879260	Why do you get a teller?
17879260	17882260	I can't live the truth, I guess.
17888260	17891260	The best thing would be for me to talk to her first.
17891260	17892260	Yes, I agree.
17892260	17895260	She's unbelievable. How could she?
17898260	17901260	I can hardly believe you could be so mean, Grandma.
17901260	17903260	Calm down, my dear.
17903260	17906260	Why, I did it all for you, Alicia.
17906260	17908260	You did it for me.
17908260	17910260	The moments are asleep. Why should you go there?
17910260	17912260	Do them a world of good, too, along sleep.
17912260	17914260	How ridiculous, Grandma!
17914260	17917260	Alicia, you've done quite well in your studies, and if you keep at it,
17917260	17922260	I see no reason why you shouldn't be a fully fledged witch before 30.
17922260	17926260	And if I do see the moments, I won't be a witch till I'm 31.
17926260	17927260	Is that what you mean?
17927260	17930260	Now, the moments are very bad, and the ones on you.
17930260	17933260	They are so disgustingly good, and if you want to be a witch,
17933260	17935260	you mustn't see them.
17936260	17937260	Hmm.
17939260	17942260	And if I promise never to go near Moomin Valley again,
17942260	17944260	will you lift the spell, Grandma?
17944260	17947260	Good girl, that's exactly what I wanted here.
17947260	17949260	You promise me, Dan, Alicia?
17949260	17950260	I promise, Grandma.
17950260	17952260	Right. The spell should be lifted.
17952260	17953260	Snuff guard.
17953260	17954260	What do you want?
17954260	17958260	There are two different ways of lifting the spell I cast on the moments.
17958260	17959260	Uh-huh.
17959260	17962260	The first one is that I go to Moomin Valley myself and chant the magic words
17962260	17964260	outside their bedroom window.
17964260	17967260	Oh, Grandma, that's not a good idea.
17967260	17972260	Oh, oh, you mean people might be upset about me casting a spell on the moments?
17972260	17973260	You may be right.
17973260	17978260	So therefore, Snuff Kid, I have no choice but to ask you to perform the task.
17978260	17980260	Oh, but why me?
17980260	17982260	You do have your harmonica with you?
17982260	17983260	Of course.
17983260	17984260	Let me have it, please.
17988260	17990260	Eldridge Cabalasum.
17990260	17991260	Eldridge Cabalasum.
17991260	17992260	Eldridge Cabalasum.
17992260	17993260	Eldridge Cabalasum.
17993260	17994260	Eldridge Cabalasum.
17994260	17999260	If you don't stop staring at me, my witchcraft won't be effective.
17999260	18002260	Alicia, get me the next potion now.
18002260	18003260	Oh.
18003260	18004260	Oh.
18004260	18006260	All right, grandmother.
18010260	18011260	Eldridge Cabalasum.
18011260	18012260	Eldridge Cabalasum.
18012260	18013260	Eldridge Cabalasum.
18013260	18014260	Eldridge Cabalasum.
18014260	18016260	So she can't do it if we look at her, huh?
18016260	18017260	Eldridge Cabalasum.
18017260	18018260	Eldridge Cabalasum.
18018260	18020260	Now, listen, Inspector.
18020260	18021260	You must do something.
18021260	18023260	You are the police, aren't you?
18023260	18028260	Well, I have to tell you, waking people up is not really part of our job.
18028260	18030260	But you're our last hope, Inspector.
18030260	18031260	You must do something.
18031260	18035260	Perhaps if you could possibly use your whistle to wake them up.
18035260	18036260	Uh-huh.
18036260	18037260	It's very shrill indoors.
18037260	18038260	Good frighten them.
18038260	18039260	And fire your revolver.
18039260	18041260	I'm sure that would do it, Inspector.
18041260	18043260	Oh, I don't carry guns.
18043260	18044260	They're dangerous.
18045260	18046260	Oh, no.
18052260	18054260	Hey, Snuffkin!
18054260	18056260	Little Y!
18056260	18057260	He sounds worried.
18057260	18059260	I bet they're still fast asleep.
18059260	18060260	Hmm.
18063260	18065260	Right, Snuffkin?
18065260	18066260	Get on with it.
18075260	18076260	No.
18076260	18078260	No.
18084260	18085260	Hmm.
18085260	18086260	It's not working, is it?
18086260	18088260	Get my chance, Snuff.
18096260	18097260	No.
18097260	18100260	Snuffkin!
18100260	18101260	Snorkemaedun!
18101260	18102260	Wake up!
18102260	18103260	Sprang is here!
18103260	18104260	Here, come on!
18104260	18105260	Ah!
18105260	18106260	Hmm.
18106260	18107260	Hmm.
18107260	18108260	Hmm.
18108260	18109260	Hmm.
18109260	18110260	Hmm.
18110260	18111260	Hmm.
18111260	18112260	Hmm.
18112260	18116260	Oh, spring is here already.
18116260	18118260	Good morning, Papa Deer.
18118260	18119260	Hmm.
18119260	18120260	Good morning.
18120260	18122260	I have a feeling we've over-slaped.
18122260	18124260	I wonder whether the others are up yet.
18124260	18125260	Hmm.
18125260	18128260	Oh, she's made a fool of you, Snuffkin.
18128260	18129260	I'm shot up, Snuff!
18129260	18132260	Maybe she forgot how to cast off the spell.
18133260	18134260	Hi, Snuffkin!
18134260	18135260	Hi!
18135260	18136260	Ah!
18136260	18137260	Morning!
18138260	18140260	Morning, everybody!
18140260	18142260	Hi, Snuffkin!
18144260	18148260	I'm so glad you've arrived back already, Snuffkin.
18148260	18149260	Yes.
18149260	18151260	You woke up early, too.
18151260	18153260	Did you hear that?
18153260	18155260	It's you that woke up late, Booman.
18155260	18157260	Who me?
18157260	18158260	Hmm.
18158260	18159260	Ah.
18159260	18167260	Now I say, Moomans are ready up and about!
18167260	18168260	What?
18168260	18170260	I snored!
18170260	18172260	Oh, it's you, you're awake.
18172260	18174260	I'm glad I didn't blow my whistle.
18174260	18176260	But we did have a reason to be worried, Inspector.
18176260	18177260	He's right.
18177260	18179260	What about Moom and Mama?
18179260	18180260	And Moom and Papa?
18180260	18182260	Oh, there, everybody.
18182260	18184260	Is anything the matter?
18184260	18185260	Nothing at all.
18185260	18186260	They're awake.
18186260	18187260	Oh, there.
18187260	18188260	I don't understand.
18188260	18190260	You don't understand words.
18190260	18193260	We were very worried because you just wouldn't wake up.
18193260	18194260	Oh, really?
18194260	18196260	You do know we always have a night, don't you?
18196260	18198260	We sleep all winter and we always wake up in this room.
18198260	18202260	Of course, of course, but this year, start your telling.
18202260	18203260	Right.
18203260	18204260	Well, we did have a bit of a problem.
18204260	18207260	You see, Moom and Papa, we couldn't snuffkin.
18207260	18209260	You're back already, yes?
18209260	18211260	Why don't you listen to us, Moom and Papa?
18211260	18212260	Very well.
18212260	18213260	Very well.
18213260	18216260	Why don't you all come in and we'll have a nice cup of tea.
18216260	18219260	And we can discuss your problem properly.
18219260	18222260	But it's your problem, I'm afraid, not ours.
18222260	18223260	What does he mean?
18223260	18225260	We don't have a problem, do we?
18225260	18228260	Please do come in anyway, everybody.
18228260	18229260	Please.
18229260	18230260	You too.
18230260	18231260	All of you, come in.
18231260	18233260	Come in, everybody.
18235260	18236260	I'm on the side.
18236260	18237260	I'm in Georgia.
18242260	18248260	Whatever happened to us this year.
18248260	18249260	Hey, snuffkin.
18255260	18256260	Alicia!
18256260	18257260	Alicia!
18262260	18264260	Oh, my man!
18264260	18266260	We've come to see you, Alicia.
18266260	18268260	That was nice of you.
18268260	18271260	Your grandmother isn't home, is she?
18271260	18272260	No.
18272260	18274260	Then we can play hide and seek.
18274260	18275260	I can't.
18275260	18277260	I promised grandma there.
18277260	18278260	Yes, I know.
18278260	18279260	Snuffkin told me.
18279260	18281260	That was a really great thing to do.
18281260	18283260	But you didn't promise not to see us.
18283260	18286260	You just promised not to go to Moom and Valley, didn't you?
18286260	18287260	Yeah.
18287260	18290260	And listen, you never promised not to play with us either, did you?
18290260	18291260	No.
18291260	18295260	So, if we came here to see you instead of you to us, then it's all right.
18295260	18297260	And you don't have to break your promise.
18297260	18299260	Oh, I suppose so.
18299260	18301260	Yes, I suppose you're right.
18301260	18303260	Well, let's play.
18303260	18304260	Yeah.
18304260	18312260	13, 4, 3, 5, 8.
18312260	18319260	Oh!
18319260	18330260	That afternoon, they all had the most wonderful time playing hide and seek in the woods.
18330260	18332260	Ha ha ha ha ha!
18332260	18333260	Hi!
18333260	18334260	Jule!
18334260	18335260	Three!
18335260	18337260	Your teeth are!
18337260	18338260	Five!
18338260	18339260	Six!
18339260	18340260	Seven!
18340260	18341260	Ha ha ha ha!
18341260	18342260	Nine!
18342260	18343260	Ten!
18343260	18344260	Eleven!
18344260	18345260	One!
18345260	18349260	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
18349260	18371260	We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
18371260	18375260	They're always happy and goes at play.
18375260	18379260	The movements are having fun day after day.
18379260	18382260	The movements.
18382260	18385260	The movements.
18385260	18392260	The movements.
18405260	18417260	Here they are for one and all.
18417260	18420260	The movements are about to come.
18420260	18423260	Come on and sit down here with me.
18423260	18426260	They're here for you on your TV.
18426260	18429260	They are the movements.
18429260	18432260	They are the movements.
18432260	18435260	So come with me, give me your hand.
18435260	18438260	I'll take you up to a movement land.
18438260	18441260	You can fly just like a bird.
18441260	18443260	Sing that song ever.
18443260	18446260	There were the movements.
18446260	18449260	There were the movements.
18449260	18452260	There were the movements.
18452260	18455260	There were the movements.
18455260	18458260	There were the movements.
18458260	18461260	There were the movements.
18461260	18464260	There were the movements.
18464260	18467260	There were the movements.
18467260	18470260	There were the movements.
18470260	18473260	What?
18473260	18475260	What?
18475260	18477260	What?
18477260	18482260	Big explosions could be heard in Woman Valley almost every night.
18482260	18484260	And women couldn't sleep a wink.
18484260	18488260	Usually there was just one, but sometimes even two.
18489260	18493260	You heard it too, Mom and Papa.
18493260	18496260	Yes, those loud bangs are keeping me awake.
18496260	18501260	I wonder if there'll be another one.
18501260	18504260	They seem to be coming from the north.
18504260	18506260	Hmm, he starts out.
18506260	18508260	Or they could be coming from lonely mountains.
18508260	18511260	If you ask me, I believe they're the work of the witch.
18511260	18512260	The witch?
18512260	18514260	But witches don't make a lot of noise.
18515260	18518260	You never know. They're sneaky characters.
18518260	18521260	Tomorrow I'll have a few words with the inspector.
18521260	18523260	It's up to him to put a stop to it.
18523260	18526260	Papa, why would the witch want to make explosions?
18526260	18527260	Why not?
18527260	18531260	The first bang wakes me up and then I lie awake waiting for the second one,
18531260	18533260	which might not come at all.
18533260	18535260	The bangs might not come from Woman Valley at all,
18535260	18538260	and they might be just an echo of the mountains.
18538260	18539260	You think so?
18539260	18540260	Yes, I do.
18540260	18542260	Well, at least that's what Snuffkin thinks.
18542260	18544260	Explosions might come from the sea.
18544260	18545260	That's what Snuffkin figured.
18545260	18549260	He thought it might be pirates or something making the noises.
18549260	18552260	He's already had pirates and they went a long time ago.
18552260	18555260	I'm plumping for the witch. There's no doubt in my mouth.
18555260	18557260	Goodness, what are you doing out here?
18557260	18559260	We're waiting for another explosion, Mama.
18559260	18561260	You'll wait in vain, dear.
18561260	18563260	You know that moment, Mama.
18563260	18565260	Well, we had two explosions last night,
18565260	18569260	and we've never had double explosions for two nights in a row.
18569260	18571260	Until now, that is.
18571260	18574260	You heard that. It clearly came from over there.
18574260	18575260	Over there?
18575260	18578260	Oh, no. It certainly came from over there.
18578260	18581260	You couldn't mistake it. I'm sure of it.
18594260	18596260	Good morning, Moomin, lovely day.
18596260	18597260	Good morning, Snuffkin.
18597260	18598260	You look very sleepy.
18598260	18602260	So would you be opposed to explosions that kept you awake for most of the night?
18602260	18605260	Those explosions are really very odd, aren't they?
18605260	18609260	They certainly are. Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?
18609260	18613260	Moomin, Papa's convinced that she's the one who's making the bangs.
18613260	18614260	I think he's wrong there.
18614260	18618260	That's what I thought, but there's nothing I could say to convince him.
18618260	18621260	So now I'm going to find out for myself.
18621260	18625260	You can certainly ask her, but do you really trust a witch to tell you the truth?
18626260	18628260	Do you, Moomin?
18628260	18631260	But witches don't have to lie, Shirley.
18639260	18641260	Is that you, Little My?
18643260	18645260	And where are you two going?
18645260	18646260	Little My.
18646260	18648260	Are you tailing me full-time or what?
18648260	18651260	Yes, whenever you're sneaking off somewhere.
18651260	18653260	I'm not sneaking. I'm just walking.
18654260	18657260	Well, I've never seen anyone walking in such a sneaky way.
18662260	18666260	Last time the witch tried to keep you from waking up, didn't she?
18666260	18670260	So, so you think now she's trying to keep you from sleeping?
18670260	18674260	Well, if she makes the explosions, it's always possible that someone else is the target.
18674260	18680260	We know very little about witches, and those bangs are probably nothing to do with the movements.
18681260	18684260	I think you guessed right, but try telling that to the movements.
18684260	18686260	We don't think it's like that at all.
18692260	18694260	Wonder if she's at home.
18694260	18696260	If she isn't, we can visit Alicia instead.
18696260	18698260	Better ask Alicia than the witch.
18698260	18700260	Anyway, she's more likely to tell us the truth.
18700260	18702260	Yes, you're right.
18706260	18707260	Uh-oh!
18711260	18714260	Look, you don't seem to realize this is a witch's house.
18714260	18716260	What do you mean by that?
18716260	18721260	I'll tell you what I mean. What I mean is, I don't want to be seen talking with goody-goodies like the moments.
18721260	18725260	You think they'll ruin your reputation, is that why you're so worried?
18728260	18732260	Uh, there's just something very important we wanted to ask you.
18732260	18734260	And then we'll leave straight away.
18741260	18743260	That room upstairs, is that Alicia's?
18743260	18745260	It is.
18745260	18747260	Is Alicia there now?
18747260	18748260	No, she isn't.
18748260	18749260	Where did she go?
18749260	18750260	She went to get some wolf's bang.
18750260	18752260	When will she be coming back?
18752260	18754260	You're not going to stop her studying.
18755260	18759260	No, we wanted to ask her something about that loud noise we hear every night.
18759260	18761260	Ah, that one!
18761260	18764260	Hey, are you the one making the bangs?
18764260	18766260	I don't make explosions.
18766260	18767260	Who is it then?
18767260	18769260	I really don't know.
18769260	18771260	But why did you say that one then?
18771260	18773260	Because the explosions bother me, too.
18774260	18776260	You think they're coming from near here?
18776260	18779260	I think they're coming from far away from the sea, maybe.
18779260	18781260	That's what snuffkin' things, too.
18781260	18784260	Any sound from the sea echoes off lonely mountain.
18784260	18786260	So you think that's where it comes from?
18786260	18792260	Why, as young man, a few days ago, I went all the way over to the beach to see what was happening.
18792260	18797260	After a whole day's witching and casting magic spells, one needs one sleep, you know.
18797260	18799260	So, what did you find them?
18799260	18800260	Nothing at all.
18800260	18805260	There was only one explosion that night, so when I got there on my brun, there was nothing more to see.
18805260	18808260	Then we still have no idea who makes the bangs.
18808260	18811260	No, and I really upset you thought it was me.
18811260	18816260	When a witch creates an explosion, it doesn't sound anything like a camel cough, I can tell you.
18818260	18820260	Camel cough, I like that!
18827260	18837260	Thank you very much, Snork Maiden.
18837260	18841260	This year I want to grow some black tulips.
18841260	18844260	Is there really such a thing as a black tulip?
18844260	18846260	There's such a dark red, they look black.
18846260	18848260	Oh, I see.
18848260	18852260	Although it wouldn't really surprise me, Snork Maiden, if there really were black ones somewhere.
18852260	18854260	We must ask the hamulaneel now.
18854260	18856260	Oh, yes.
18857260	18861260	I know it's embarrassing, but I'm so excited I can't go to sleep at night.
18861260	18865260	Oh, I have no problem going to sleep at night, but that noise wakes me up, Pamulane.
18865260	18866260	What noise is that?
18866260	18868260	I told you that noise.
18870260	18873260	Oh, I see, you're talking about the explosion.
18873260	18875260	You know anything about it, Mr. Himulane?
18875260	18877260	No, nothing at all.
18877260	18881260	No, those bangs are not what keeps me awake, moment papa.
18881260	18885260	No, I'm waiting for reply from the botanist federation.
18885260	18886260	reply?
18886260	18887260	Yes.
18887260	18889260	Don't you remember a few months ago?
18889260	18890260	Power strange.
18890260	18892260	I thought I told you about it.
18892260	18894260	Well, I certainly told everyone else I know.
18894260	18897260	I sent them a brand new species.
18897260	18898260	New species.
18898260	18901260	I'd never seen anything like it in my whole life.
18901260	18902260	A new wild orchid.
18902260	18905260	I'm so excited I can hardly speak.
18905260	18906260	Really?
18906260	18907260	A new wild orchid?
18907260	18909260	How very interesting.
18909260	18910260	Yes, isn't it?
18910260	18913260	Oh, it would be such a great honor for me and for everyone else.
18913260	18916260	They call it orchidaca amulensis or amuliformis.
18916260	18918260	No, I'm sure they will.
18918260	18922260	So now you understand why I've had so many sleepless nights.
18922260	18924260	Yes, indeed.
18924260	18926260	Trouble is they should have answered by now.
18926260	18929260	Maybe they're still trying to decide what to call it.
18929260	18932260	Maybe they can't decide between orchidaca amulensis
18932260	18935260	and orchidaca amuliformis.
18935260	18936260	Mmm.
18936260	18937260	Oh.
18937260	18939260	What is it?
18939260	18942260	Now I see, at last I understand.
18942260	18945260	I am getting no reply from the botanist federation
18945260	18948260	because it is not a new species.
18948260	18950260	Oh, of course.
18950260	18952260	Somebody's already found it.
18952260	18953260	Oh.
18953260	18956260	This is too much money.
18956260	18957260	No, no.
18957260	18959260	Stupid I am.
18959260	18963260	This is the end of me as a scientist, of course.
18963260	18966260	Calm down, don't upset yourself, Mr. Himmel.
18966260	18970260	Everybody will laugh at me and call me Mr. Amulensis.
18971260	18973260	Now listen, Mr. Himmel.
18973260	18976260	The reply is a long time coming because they must examine
18976260	18979260	your plant most carefully before making a decision.
18979260	18982260	They must read all the books first to be sure.
18984260	18987260	You really think so, Mum and Patna?
18987260	18989260	Could it really take so long, do you think?
18989260	18991260	Of course, these things take time.
18991260	18993260	When did you send it off?
18993260	18995260	A month ago.
18995260	18997260	There you are, that's no time at all.
18997260	18999260	You have to learn to be patient, Himmel.
18999260	19000260	You think so?
19000260	19002260	Oh, I feel better already.
19002260	19005260	Oh, I'm so glad you feel happier, Mr. Himmel.
19005260	19007260	Don't you worry, my friend.
19007260	19009260	Mama, great news dear.
19009260	19011260	Mr. Himmelens discovered a completely new plant
19011260	19014260	and is going to be called Himmelensis.
19014260	19016260	Oh, that's wonderful.
19016260	19018260	Congratulations, Mr. Himmel.
19018260	19020260	Oh, well, it isn't official yet.
19020260	19023260	No, they're just thinking about the name still.
19023260	19025260	Give them time.
19025260	19028260	We should have a party for Mr. Himmel and shouldn't we, Papa?
19028260	19029260	What?
19029260	19031260	Oh, yes, indeed.
19031260	19033260	When, Papa, tonight?
19033260	19035260	Let me think.
19035260	19038260	We should wait just a little bit longer, perhaps.
19038260	19040260	Oh, why do you say that?
19040260	19043260	Mr. Himmelens, you know that rare plant you found?
19043260	19045260	Does it have any flowers?
19045260	19046260	But, of course.
19046260	19047260	Are they pretty?
19047260	19049260	Very pretty.
19049260	19052260	Yes, just like you, Snork Maiden.
19052260	19054260	Oh, Mr. Himmelens.
19055260	19057260	Hey, look, Snork Maiden.
19057260	19060260	Why don't we go and find out about those explosions tonight, huh?
19060260	19061260	All right.
19061260	19063260	You'll need me to find the way.
19063260	19064260	You want to come along?
19064260	19065260	You bet.
19065260	19067260	They come later tonight.
19067260	19069260	I won't go to sleep, bad.
19069260	19071260	What do you think, Snork Maiden?
19071260	19072260	I'm not sure.
19072260	19074260	Isn't there anything you can do to change your mind, Moomin?
19074260	19075260	I don't know.
19075260	19076260	Listen, little Maiden.
19076260	19077260	You have to be careful.
19077260	19079260	This could be good.
19079260	19082260	I'm not sure, isn't there anything you can do to change your mind, Moomin?
19082260	19083260	You have to be careful.
19083260	19085260	This could be dangerous.
19085260	19087260	Obviously, or I wouldn't come.
19087260	19088260	Would I spoil my sleep?
19088260	19090260	Well, stick close to us then.
19090260	19091260	Yes, do that.
19091260	19095260	I also went down to the beach late last night to try and find out what was happening.
19095260	19099260	And while I was there, I saw the witch flying around on her broomstick.
19099260	19100260	Oh, really?
19100260	19102260	Why didn't you tell me so I could have come along?
19102260	19104260	I could hide better than you.
19104260	19105260	You're so white.
19105260	19106260	See, Moomin?
19106260	19109260	I'm not big in white like you.
19109260	19111260	Oh, there's someone coming.
19111260	19112260	Who?
19116260	19117260	It's Alicia.
19117260	19118260	Hi, Alicia.
19118260	19119260	Hi, Alicia.
19119260	19121260	Oh, Moomin.
19121260	19123260	Hello, Alicia.
19123260	19124260	How are you?
19124260	19127260	Have you three come here to play with me?
19127260	19130260	No, I'm afraid we have, but it's good to see you.
19130260	19131260	Yes, Alicia.
19131260	19132260	Yes?
19132260	19135260	Has your grandmother been kind to you since your last visit to us?
19135260	19136260	Very kind.
19136260	19138260	She's been treating me very well.
19138260	19140260	Ever since I stopped coming to see you?
19140260	19141260	Oh, good.
19141260	19143260	But we don't miss you, Alicia.
19143260	19144260	Oh, I miss you, too.
19144260	19146260	But I must keep my promise to her.
19146260	19148260	She'd be upset if I broke it.
19148260	19149260	What are these wings?
19149260	19150260	They're herbs.
19150260	19152260	Herbs are very important for a witch.
19152260	19156260	And frogs, bellies, and lizard's tails, they're important, too, of course.
19156260	19158260	I think that's licorice.
19158260	19159260	That's right.
19159260	19160260	Very clever, Snuffkin.
19160260	19162260	We use that for heartburn and coughs.
19162260	19164260	The taste smells quite nice.
19164260	19167260	And it also stops cows from giving their milk.
19167260	19168260	I see.
19168260	19169260	That's interesting.
19171260	19174260	Oh, keeps my promise.
19174260	19176260	I love you, thanks.
19191260	19193260	Oh, it's a ride.
19193260	19195260	Hello, Mr Hail.
19195260	19196260	Mr. Ann Hehman.
19196260	19197260	Splendid days.
19197260	19199260	Hello, Mr. Ann Bellin.
19199260	19200860	I work so hard.
19200860	19202860	Yeah, I guess I do with that.
19205060	19207060	Wait, stop.
19207060	19209060	What is it, Mr. Hemuellen?
19209060	19211860	My letter. I just want my letter.
19211860	19213260	There isn't one.
19213260	19214460	But why not?
19214460	19217360	You didn't have any yesterday or the day before.
19217360	19220960	Yeah, I know that. Nobody's written to you. That's why.
19220960	19222560	Well, somebody should have written.
19222560	19226160	Are you quite, quite sure that you've gone through your bag properly?
19226160	19230060	Don't you know I'm expecting an important letter from an important scientist.
19230060	19231660	It must be in your bag.
19231660	19234160	Ah, alright then. Go ahead.
19234160	19234760	What?
19234760	19238360	Well, you don't seem to trust me to do my job properly, Mr. Hemuellen.
19238360	19241160	Go ahead and have a look for yourself then.
19241160	19243660	Oh, but of course I trust you. Sorry.
19243660	19245760	No, no. You better have a look.
19245760	19246860	What do you think I do?
19246860	19249260	Steam them open and read them at night?
19249260	19250460	No.
19250460	19253860	Oh, you seem to have a lot of letters today.
19254860	19258860	Oh, I really think I should ask for a higher salary.
19258860	19260360	I deserve it.
19262860	19264860	I'm just starving.
19264860	19268360	I might have to go over and visit the moments in a minute.
19276360	19279360	I'm sleepy too. I could go on sleeping.
19279860	19281860	Oh!
19281860	19283860	What do you think you're doing?
19283860	19287360	Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
19287360	19290860	Hmm? There's nothing else out here and you didn't see me?
19290860	19292360	I'm sorry.
19292360	19294860	Oh dear. What does this matter with you?
19294860	19297360	Is this place called Moomin Valley?
19297360	19299360	Yes. That's right.
19299360	19303360	At last, I found it. I never thought I'd really make it.
19303360	19306360	Excuse me. Are you alright?
19306360	19308360	Doctor me, miss.
19308360	19311360	No, tell me what's bothering you.
19311360	19314360	Oh, she's ill. She's got a fever.
19314360	19316360	Please leave me alone.
19316360	19320360	But you can lie here. You should be in bed, young lady.
19320360	19322860	Do you know a man called Hamilton?
19322860	19326360	Yes. Have you walked all the way to Moomin Valley to visit him?
19326360	19330360	So I have come to the right place. He does live here.
19330360	19332860	Oh, yes. He lives very close to here.
19332860	19336860	I'm so glad I must see him immediately.
19336860	19339860	Oh, what shall I do? I must do something.
19339860	19342860	Come here, someone. Someone help me.
19342860	19344860	Oh, my goodness.
19346860	19352860	Help! Anyone help! Help me somebody!
19363860	19365860	Papa! Papa!
19365860	19368860	He's up in the guest room. If you want him, mom is there as well.
19368860	19370860	What for?
19370860	19372860	I just rescued a girl, you know.
19372860	19373860	A girl?
19373860	19374860	Did you sniff?
19374860	19378860	That's right. Very pretty, too. She's ill and I put her to bed myself.
19378860	19380860	I'm going to see her.
19380860	19382860	Me, too.
19382860	19386860	I want another look as well.
19386860	19389860	First, we must bring her fever down.
19389860	19391860	I think you're right.
19392860	19394860	Yes?
19396860	19398860	Sniff just told us about her.
19398860	19400860	Oh, dear. Is she unconscious?
19400860	19401860	Yes.
19401860	19402860	Where'd she come from?
19402860	19406860	We don't know a little, Maya, but Sniff said she'd come here to visit the hemeland.
19406860	19409860	That's right. Snort Maidens gone to get him.
19409860	19411860	She's pretty, isn't she?
19411860	19413860	You're right. Very.
19413860	19416860	By the way, Moomin, what did the witch say?
19416860	19420860	Oh, dear. I thought I'd really run like this.
19420860	19422860	She's missing her young girl.
19422860	19425860	Well, if she's sick, why don't you give her some medicine?
19425860	19427860	I don't know any young girls apart from her.
19427860	19429860	Don't. Just keep running.
19435860	19438860	I told you. I do not know this person.
19438860	19439860	Maybe she's changed.
19439860	19441860	I've already told you.
19441860	19443860	I have never known any young girls.
19443860	19447860	Then why do you think she'd want to come to visit you, Hamilton?
19447860	19449860	She's a botanist.
19449860	19454860	And obviously, she's heard of me and wants to come and see the famous hemeland for herself.
19454860	19457860	Oh, dear. She can tell us when she wakes up.
19457860	19460860	We must leave her now so that grandma's medicine can work.
19466860	19468860	I think I'll be getting home.
19468860	19470860	Oh, we couldn't let you go just like that.
19470860	19472860	Please, stay and have some tea with us.
19472860	19475860	Thank you, but no, I have some plans to press.
19475860	19478860	And you're sure you're quite sure you don't know this girl?
19478860	19480860	Absolutely certain.
19480860	19482860	I really must go.
19485860	19488860	I'd forgotten all about the bangs.
19488860	19490860	Well, we haven't snuffed Ken and I.
19490860	19491860	I'm going to look for them tonight.
19491860	19493860	I'd like to come too, but I can't.
19493860	19495860	I'm going with them.
19495860	19496860	Are you snort maiden?
19496860	19499860	You'll be hiding on the beach in the middle of the night?
19499860	19503860	Yes. And then we'll rush off to where the bangs are coming from as soon as we hear them.
19503860	19504860	That's the plan.
19504860	19506860	Oh, I'd really love to come.
19506860	19508860	I'd rather go to bed.
19508860	19511860	I'd be a bit scared of the beach in the middle of the night.
19511860	19514860	After all, it's my duty to stay here with movement mama.
19514860	19516860	Are you coming, sniff?
19516860	19518860	Certainly not. Not me.
19522860	19524860	It just occurred to me that's why she's here.
19524860	19525860	Oh.
19537860	19539860	Here, you better take this movement.
19539860	19541860	You might get very hungry.
19541860	19542860	Oh, thank you, mama.
19542860	19545860	A midnight snack. I really envy you.
19545860	19548860	Well, then, Papa. Why don't you come with us?
19548860	19552860	Oh, there's nothing I'd love more, but I'd better not tonight. Right, mama?
19552860	19554860	Oh, definitely not.
19554860	19558860	What would I do if something happened to the girl while you were away?
19558860	19559860	Exactly.
19559860	19562860	All right, Papa. We'll find out about the bangs for you.
19562860	19564860	Thank you, mama.
19567860	19568860	Mmm.
19570860	19571860	Mmm.
19571860	19573860	Mmm.
19573860	19575860	Mmm. Good.
19575860	19577860	I think we should save this food for a while.
19577860	19580860	We might have to wait a long time for the explosions.
19580860	19582860	And they might not come tonight.
19582860	19585860	Stop stuffing yourself, Moon, and the rest is for a snuck in and me.
19585860	19587860	But you can't eat anymore?
19587860	19591860	Yes, I can. We must share it in equal parts, otherwise it's not fair.
19591860	19594860	I think it should be shared in proportion to how big one is.
19597860	19598860	Mmm.
19598860	19599860	Mmm.
19603860	19605860	Mmm.
19608860	19610860	Mmm.
19618860	19619860	Mmm.
19623860	19625860	Uh, where are the fingerprints?
19625860	19634860	to see. Keep a sharp look out. Look over there. What is it?
19640860	19644860	That's what I call fireworks.
19646860	19650860	Come on. Somebody must be out there in a boat.
19656860	19660860	There's a boat.
19661860	19666860	The fireworks must have come from there. Hey, come ashore!
19667860	19673860	Is that the hemuline you think? No, I don't think so. It looks like him, but he was much younger.
19674860	19682860	And so as a result of their excursion to the beach, they finally learned that the big bangs that had been waking everyone up were fireworks.
19682860	19687860	They also learned that the fireworks were coming from a boat far out to sea.
19688860	19692860	But the man who had sent them up disappeared into the night.
19712860	19729860	The Moons are having fun day after day. The Moons. The Moons. The Moons.
