1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
They're here for you on your TV.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So come on.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Come on.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come you are your TV. They are the movements. They are the movements.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:38,399
So come with me, give me your hand. I'll take you up to a moment land. You can fly just like a bird.

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:50,000
Sing that song ever. There were the movements. There were the movements. There were the movements, there was the movements

12

I asked her if she wanted to play with us, and she said yes!

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Danny, come on!

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We're going to have some fun! She wanted to play with us, and she said yes!

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Minnie, come on! We're going to have some fun!

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Right, let's go.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Ninny, who became invisible because of her sarcastic ant, was now visible up to the neck.

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But no matter how much of Granny's remedy she took

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
or how nice the movements were to her,

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:53,000
her head still remained invisible. So...

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's the invisible child. I wonder what she really looks like.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ugh, well good morning everybody.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,400
Morning, lazy bones. We've been up for hours and hours.

24
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,719
We're going to play hide and seek in the woods.

25
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,120
Great.

26
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,680
Nini, are you all right?

27
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,319
Yes, thanks.

28
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,439
Hmm.

29
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,280
This is dumb.

30
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,039
If I could see your face, I wouldn't have to ask.

31
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,280
Doesn't help with you, Sniff.

32
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:43,000
You always ask silly questions. It's a bit big for hide and seek isn't it?

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But that's so good about it!

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay, this is a good place to start, but we've got a new rule for the game.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Once you find somewhere to hide, you've got to stay in the same place, no moving about anyone.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Do you understand, Ninny?

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Right, you're to go first, Sniff.

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Huh? Why isn't always me first?

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We'll have a practice for nanny's sake.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Show her what to do.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Uh, I didn't see it because an easy game.

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Not for nanny, it isn't. She's never played it before.

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What? Never ever?

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No, and not just hide and seek.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
She hasn't played any games at all.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Not even when she was visible?

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No, nothing.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,040
Oh, that's terrible. So, will you was visible? No nothing. Oh that's terrible. So will you go first?

49
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,879
No I won't. Oh okay I'll go first then. I'll count to 10 slowly so you'll have plenty of time to find somewhere.

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:47,000
One, two, Mini. Hurry up. For!

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Five!

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can still see you.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Six!

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Seven!

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Good, good, good! Hello, Minnie.

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't be frightened.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why don't you hide in that bush over there?

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He'll never find you.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm coming.

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thank you. Oh, my God! God, you sniff! Eh.

61
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Huh?

62
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Huh?

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Huh?

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Huh?

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Huh?

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Huh?

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Huh?

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Huh?

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Huh?

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Huh?

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Huh?

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Huh?

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Huh?

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Huh?

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Huh?

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Huh?

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Huh?

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Oh, I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm so excited.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm so excited.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm so excited.

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm so excited.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm so excited.

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm so excited.

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm so excited.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm so excited.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm so excited.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm so excited. I'm so excited. Oops!

89
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Got you, little Mike.

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'd like to know where Ninny's hiding.

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh, look. Oh!

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Ah, come out, Ninny.

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I've got you.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That was a good place, but I saw your ribbeth.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh! Now for snork maiden. She's always easy to find.

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Ha! That's only because she wants to be found.

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Found you snork maiden. One.

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Two.

99
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Don't wait, nanny, this is my bush.

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Four.

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Hey, nanny, I'll show you a good place. Just come with your uncle stinky.

102
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Now don't worry, no one will find you there.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It opens up once you're inside.

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:06,319
Come on, it's a bit steep, I'll help you.

105
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh!

106
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh!

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh!

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh!

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Oh!

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh!

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh!

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh!

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Oh!

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh!

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Oh!

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh!

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh!

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh!

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh!

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh!

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Oh!

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh!

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Right, that should keep you quiet. You're a bit too visible at the moment.

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, let me out.

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But I'm sure if you stay here until tomorrow,

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
no one will see it all.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Please don't leave me here.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Please.

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh, it's...

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, please.

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's it.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Now tomorrow we'll hit the bank!

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Let me out! Please let me out!

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm very glad I thought of bringing Ninny here.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's nice to have her here too, Tiki.

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
She's no trouble at all.

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You're all pretty eccentric,

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and it might be just what she needs to make her want to be seen again.

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, and you're very kind, of course.

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, thank you. I think, I suppose we should be flattens, shouldn't we?

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh, yes, definitely.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,159
She started to talk, but her voice is very weak.

145
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,960
You have to listen very carefully.

146
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,639
Has it always been like that?

147
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,240
Or just since she was invisible?

148
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm not sure.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,440
I don't think it was like that before.

150
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,000
Lots of people manage very well without using their heads,

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,480
so I'm certain any will be all right.

152
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,679
Yes, and I'm glad she's got movement in the others to play with.

153
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,000
She's never had anybody before, you know.

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,299
I think she'd find it a bit difficult to tickle.

155
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, Moomin, Mama, I think that all she needs is something to shock her out of it.

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Huh. Got you little, my.

157
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh, that bush was too prickly anyway.

158
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I expect I'm the last one, hey.

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
No, I haven't found any yet.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Mini?

161
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,600
I didn't think Mini would hide so well.

162
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,100
Any luck, Sniff?

163
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,379
There's nowhere else to look, Momen.

164
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:13,500
Perhaps she's lost or fallen or hurt herself.

165
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,139
I've looked absolutely everywhere.

166
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:18,139
I bet she's invisible again.

167
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:20,480
That's why I can't find her.

168
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,080
I bet Sniff hasn't looked everywhere.

169
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,519
She can't be far.

170
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,000
Do you know where she is, Moomin?

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
No, I haven't seen her at all. Not since we started.

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Nanny! Come on, we're going home. We've finished playing.

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Nanny!

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Oh my goodness, where could she be?

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Nanny!

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's your turn, Sniff, so you've got to find her.

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Nanny!

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Not once the game's over, I haven't.

179
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,399
Never mind. We'll all look. We must find her.

180
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,399
We are supposed to be looking after her, you know?

181
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,399
Ugh.

182
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,799
Aw, come on. Nanny, the game's over. We've finished.

183
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,600
Nanny, Nanny, hurry up. We're going home for cookies and lemonade.

184
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Nanny, Nanny! Nanny!

185
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Nanny!

186
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Nanny!

187
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Nanny!

188
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Nanny!

189
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Nanny!

190
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Nanny!

191
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Nanny!

192
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Nanny!

193
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Nanny!

194
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Nanny!

195
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Nanny!

196
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Nanny!

197
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Nanny!

198
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Nanny!

199
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Nanny!

200
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Nanny!

201
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Nanny!

202
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Nanny!

203
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Can you hear us?

204
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,000
We weren't supposed to come this far, Snork Maiden. Nanny! Nanny! Can you hear us?

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We weren't supposed to come this far, Snork Maiden.

206
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
She might be really lost or frightened or anything!

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Nanny! Where are you, Nanny?

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Can you hear me? Nanny!

209
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Help! I'm over here!

210
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Did you hear something?

211
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,279
I'm not sure. Help!

212
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,279
Help!

213
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,279
I'm here!

214
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,720
That's her!

215
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,919
She's not far away!

216
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:53,919
Lenny!

217
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,320
Where are you?

218
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Here!

219
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Behind this rock!

220
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,360
Of course her voice coming from!

221
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,200
That way I think!

222
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Lenny!

223
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,460
I can't hear what you're saying.

224
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,460
Try and shout a bit louder.

225
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,360
I'm over here!

226
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,639
Over here!

227
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,200
Behind the rock!

228
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
I still can't hear properly.

229
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Louder than any louder!

230
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:18,740
Behind the rock!

231
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,240
Which rock?

232
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,899
Over here!

233
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,399
The big rock!

234
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Over there!

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I've never shouted so much in my life!

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Nanny!

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Nanny, are you behind this rock, Nanny?

238
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes! Stinky block the cave with it!

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't worry, we'll get you out.

240
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,600
Hang on!

241
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,200
Are you alright, Lily? Thank you, Mum.

242
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,500
Oh, thank you!

243
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,299
Your voice seems to be...

244
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,899
Oh, what? Oh, nothing.

245
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,299
Try and hold on to me, and I'll pull you out.

246
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,500
Oh, thank you!

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Hey, what's happened?

248
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Where'd you find her?

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
In the cave.

250
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Wow, what a brilliant hiding place had you find it!

251
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What's wrong? Did I say something funny?

252
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Now that was very mean of stinking. The clever idea though, I meant to use it for a ban robbery.

253
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh, Papa!

254
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Oh I know stinky shouldn't have done it,

255
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and it must have been a nasty shopping trapped in the dark in that cave,

256
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
but no real harm came to her and she didn't disappear,

257
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and her voice got much stronger.

258
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,639
Because she yelled so loud.

259
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,200
Oh, goodness, did you, dear?

260
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,080
Yes, Mum and Mama.

261
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,840
Mum and told me to yell loudly so he'd know where I was.

262
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,679
And it was loud too.

263
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,320
Good for you, Nanny.

264
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,919
It's surprising the things you can do if you have to, and you ought to remember that

265
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,000
people who speak loudly are usually very noticeable.

266
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Go on, yeah, I want to see it.

267
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That's a good idea, Ninny.

268
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If shouting brought back your voice, you never know it might be just what's needed to make the rest of you visible.

269
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Try and get angry as well.

270
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah, that's easy. Just think about stinky.

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah, and how horrible he is.

272
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That should make you angry. Very angry.

273
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Just your white stinky!

274
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I can't help faster than me!

275
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Stinky, wait! We want to talk to you!

276
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't want to talk to you!

277
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
No!

278
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Come on!

279
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, you are right, sniff!

280
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You can't get away, stinky.

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The forest is my home ground. You won't catch me in here.

282
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Ah!

283
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I did it.

284
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:25,440
Hold it. This hole to change your mind and scare her so much that she'd become totally invisible again

285
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:31,559
She had to be invisible for my plan now get me out of here. It's all right. Stinking. See you tomorrow

286
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:46,000
You crux you things I had such a wonderful plan! Ah! Ah! They're spiteful!

287
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Oh, let's hear them my next job!

288
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But despite all that had happened,

289
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Ninny's face was still not to be seen.

290
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Then, about ten days later... This weather seems to push the nails out.

291
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I haven't seen anyone stare at the sea like Minnie does.

292
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Well maybe she's crying now.

293
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What's the matter?

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's the sea. It's far too big! You don't have to go on it, you know.

295
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Mama! Mama! What's up?

296
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Hmm?

297
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What's the matter with her?

298
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Nothing to worry about. She's never seen the sea before

299
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and she's just surprised at how big it is.

300
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,759
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What's the matter with her? Nothing to worry about. She's never seen the sea before, and she's just surprised at how big it is.

301
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Well, there's an awful lot of water, that's for sure.

302
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Oh.

303
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,599
Nanny's lucky.

304
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,400
I wish there was something to surprise or excite me.

305
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,559
Nothing's happened for weeks. Anything would be nice.

306
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,279
Mama must be bored.

307
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,799
I think you're right.

308
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,480
But she never gets bored.

309
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,240
Well, she is now. She needs something to happen.

310
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,319
I think we should do something to surprise her.

311
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,640
Like what?

312
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,000
Well, I know what we can do.

313
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,119
Well, tell me.

314
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,000
We'll creep up behind her and just give her a little push.

315
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What, Papa?

316
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Push her into the sea?

317
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh, Papa, you can't.

318
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Mama wouldn't like it.

319
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Just watch me.

320
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But the water's freezing.

321
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
A mama will get all wet.

322
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We never found the water too cold when we were your age.

323
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You young people today have no sense of fun.

324
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Did you really used to do things like that?

325
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,980
All the time. Papa?

326
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,980
Yes, Mumann?

327
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
Oh, nothing.

328
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,480
Don't worry, Mumann.

329
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,160
Mumann, Joy's a prank.

330
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:40,000
You'll find it very funny, I promise. I know you don't!

331
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
No! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

332
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Don't you dare push your end to that big horrible scene.

333
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Let me explain to me.

334
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
There's nothing to explain.

335
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You're a big bully.

336
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
She'd have gone all wet.

337
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What a nasty trick.

338
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You could never, never. I'm sorry. Yeah. What? What? What?

339
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What?

340
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What?

341
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What?

342
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What?

343
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What?

344
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What?

345
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What?

346
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What?

347
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What?

348
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What?

349
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What?

350
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What?

351
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What?

352
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000

And so Nini left movement house with Tiki.

383
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,920

384
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,920
she was ready for anything.

385
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,400
Anything that is except seeing her aunt, she said.
