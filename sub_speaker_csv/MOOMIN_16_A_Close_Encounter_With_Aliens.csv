654520,656520,"Just try it and see",649300,656400,"SPEAKER_14"
659520,661520,"I think he's missing his home",656500,660000,"SPEAKER_06"
661520,667520,"Wherever in the universe that might be I wonder where his parents are he can't have come on his own",660400,660700,"SPEAKER_06"
667520,669520,"He seems far too little for that",660400,660700,"SPEAKER_06"
669520,671520,"Well, I don't know",660400,660700,"SPEAKER_06"
671520,674520,"But he's obviously missing them and he seems very unhappy",660400,660700,"SPEAKER_06"
674520,678520,"Do you think the inspector would really arrest him moving papa?",673000,675100,"SPEAKER_07"
678520,681520,"Possibly, he would think it is duty",675500,678700,"SPEAKER_07"
681520,684520,"Well, that would be horrible of him",679000,681400,"SPEAKER_04"

689520,691520,"Oh, it's inspector",685700,688000,"SPEAKER_07"
691520,694520,"Oh dear, he mustn't find him here",690200,691600,"SPEAKER_14"

766520,770520,"An inspector in shining armor, you mean little my?",764700,766500,"SPEAKER_07"
770520,772520,"That's just what I thought",766900,770200,"SPEAKER_08"
772520,775520,"You'll never need a lamp to be seen, inspector",772100,772600,"SPEAKER_08"
775520,778520,"I like it, criminals will be afraid of me",773100,775600,"SPEAKER_14"
778520,782520,"I can't wait to get back to the station and show the constables",776000,782500,"SPEAKER_08"
782520,784520,"Handy for reading in bed, too",776000,782500,"SPEAKER_08"

803520,804520,"Of course I can",803400,810800,"SPEAKER_12"
804520,806520,"It's just that I need my language converted to help me translate",803400,810800,"SPEAKER_12"
806520,809520,"And if you hadn't taken it from my ship and hidden it",803400,810800,"SPEAKER_12"
809520,811520,"I would have been able to talk sooner",803400,810800,"SPEAKER_12"

910520,914520,"In other words, I believe you have been hiding an alien here.",909300,910300,"SPEAKER_04"
914520,919520,"Oh, Inspector, I don't think hiding is the right word. That suggests we are trying to keep something from you.",914000,914300,"SPEAKER_04"
