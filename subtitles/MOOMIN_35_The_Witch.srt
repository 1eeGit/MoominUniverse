1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,560
here they are for one and all the moments are about to come on and sit down here with

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:32,800
me here for you on your TV they are the moments they are the moments so come with me give me your hand

3
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:41,360
I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just like a bird sing the best song ever there

4
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:56,800
were the moments there were the moments there were the moments

5
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:27,400
these days moman and snuffkin were together even more than ever winter would

6
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:34,280
hit moman valley any day now and then they would have to park moman to go into

7
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:45,720
the hibernation and snuffkin to be for his trip so you look sad for something upset you

8
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,640
where are you off to moman to the lonely mountains how come you two are always

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,840
stealing off somewhere we're not stealing off we're just going for a walk to

10
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,320
lonely mountains just the two of you you're even worse than usual never taking any

11
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,040
of us with you I hadn't noticed are we really doing that I'm not sure maybe we are no

12
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,280
maybe's about it let me tell you it's very rude but we were just off for a walk I know well

13
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,160
then why are you going it'll start snowing any day now little night and then we won't be able

14
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,440
to go anywhere will we we wanted a last look at moman valley from above before that happens a

15
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,120
likely story but it's true I'm off very soon and I wanted to see it all to give me a picture to

16
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,240
remember while I'm walking did you hear that snorke main sniff come here

17
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,520
when do you mind if we come along with you of course not you see we thought you were

18
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,640
probably plotting something secret and weren't letting any of us in on it oh come on we don't

19
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,440
have any secrets from you it's just that well you know what I mean snuffkin will be leaving for

20
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,720
months months very soon never mind off we go

21
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,360
it would be fun to see it all from here in the middle of winter all white must be very beautiful

22
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,480
oh I don't think so with everything white and clean in summer it's very beautiful

23
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,640
well I'm coming back here in winter to see it for myself you can't do that you're hibernating

24
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,480
well maybe not I thought that this year I try to keep awake all winter you mean just like

25
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:36,000
moman and I did last year yes you could never do it what about you are you hibernating I'm not all

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,440
that mad about the snow and the cold and dark so I'll hibernate I'm very happy to be going home I've

27
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,720
seen it all now well we didn't ask you to come along little night well I don't we go take a look

28
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,760
at that beautiful lake against sniff the one with the golden fish oh no that's too far away

29
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,600
you're just afraid of the forest of witches aren't you sniff not at all I'm not a bit scared

30
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:12,000

32
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,360
alone well grandma told me there was a big rock by the path leading up to lonely mountains into

33
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:44,240
wait there but there are other rocks by the path you know are there but this is the only one I've

34
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,600
seen so far your grandma must be crazy or something making you wait in a place like this no our

35
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,040
house is in the forest and she's coming to show me the way in the forest you mean the forest of

36
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:02,240
witches yes I suppose so it's not very far from here that's it definitely how long have you been

37
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,400
waiting here oh about an hour one hour she's not very punctual perhaps I was early

38
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:18,640
yes she was an hour early oh it's grandma welcome Alicia

39
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,080
where do you find all these children my dear I was waiting here all alone and then they came

40
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,280
along the path and wanted to help very kind of you I'm sure well don't just stand there my dear

41
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:45,680
let's go come along excuse me excuse me ma'am but don't you live in the forest

42
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,800
and did I do in what part of it let me see it must be about right in the middle interesting the

43
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,160
only place I know of is an old house where they say witches used to live you don't say I'm

44
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,400
mad well what do you know what will he think I'm next

45
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
oh

46
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:25,840
her grandmother is a witch I think but surely they don't exist of course not like dragons don't exist

47
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,760
well she doesn't seem like a nasty one how can you tell moment I don't think that nice girl would

48
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:42,560
have a bad one for grandma perhaps not so tell me what makes you think she's a witch yeah who else

49
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,000
could live in that forest papa I can't think of anyone right now but some people would like it

50
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,600
yes I suppose you're right I hope you are well I've lived in movement valley for a long time

51
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,280
and I'm never once seen a witch so they don't exist

52
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,840
yeah oh stop working now snork dinner's ready I'm coming

53
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:17,200
no wonder it's so light look the moon is up snork maiden I think it would be very wise for you

54
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,880
to stay with the movements from tonight on why on earth do you think that snork I've decided not

55
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,040
to hibernate this winter why ever not I want to complete the blueprint for my new flying ship

56
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:36,880
by next spring for a real inventor sleep is an unnecessary luxury science my dear snork maiden

57
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,280
will not wait while inventors take a nap but you know dear snork how dependent you are in your sleep

58
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,080
I'll stay with very well then this winter I will hibernate with the movements

59
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,080
excellent shall we have dinner I'm ready now

60
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,360
most certainly snork snork maiden will be just fine here with us thank you

61
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,360
this is nice for movement too now you'll have snork maiden to keep him company yes

62
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,160
but who needs company when they're hibernating after all moment will be faster sleep

63
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,000
never the less sleeping is much nicer when someone else sleeps in the same room when do we start

64
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,240
hibernating do you think with weather like this in another few days again so early we'll have

65
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,120
snow before the week is out well good luck with your new blueprint snork I look forward to seeing

66
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,880
your flying ship in the spring hmm come this time next year I'll definitely be flying about

67
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:52,000
thanks again for taking snork maiden it's not trouble at all good night then good night snork see you

68
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:06,320
snork maiden good luck this winter snork thank goodness at last I can really concentrate on my work

69
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,120
I don't believe this

70
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:31,760
am I hallucinating

71
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,920
oh a witch I'm sure it was I'm positive I'm a broomstick

72
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,240
when the snork gets an idea in his head it's not much room for anyone or anything else is there

73
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,000
I hope you'll succeed this time at least in my dream that rounding really flew well

74
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,400
I often dream that I fly but I wouldn't dream of trying it out snork must have had some sort of a new idea

75
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,360
oh it's snork

76
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,720
what's the matter

77
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,120
oh that's my piece of cake

78
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:36,000
you look like you've seen a ghost not a ghost she left at me

79
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,640
murdered she was flying on a broom no engine at all are you talking about the witch what's the

80
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:49,920
use there's no point if you can do it so easily holding itself together you really swore yes

81
00:10:49,920 --> 00:11:03,200
but what right near I can't see any witch up there snork just the moon up in the sky

82
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,560
and she was really flying in the sky is that what snork said well he should know about

83
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,040
things that fly hmm but I just can't believe it until I've seen it myself if she really is a witch

84
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,720
then what about the girl I mean no one could be happy living with a witch I really don't know I

85
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,640
thought witches had to be old maybe it's not her real grandmother she could be adopted well

86
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,560
woman we must get to the bottom of this yes enough can we must

87
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,360
huh cop you at it again you and your secret plan where are you going today you can't come with

88
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,720
us little fly and why not because we're going on a dangerous mission we're going to the forest of

89
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,320
witches well if you're in any danger then I must certainly come along to look after you moon and

90
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:14,880
come on besides nothing's exciting to happen to me since I went up with a kite this is so exciting

91
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,440
sleeping only through a set of four that I must cram in one adventure first this is what we'll do

92
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,520
I grab the witch and while she's helpless you two grab the girl and whisk her away to safety

93
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,640
that sounds great but we don't know if she is a witch little my if we grab her and she isn't a

94
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,760
witch it would be embarrassing and we could all be in trouble maybe the witch needed an innocent

95
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,400
maiden to try out some potions to experiment on her maybe let's find out how do we find out by

96
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,440
snooping around I suppose I hope you'll think of something a bit better than that before we get

97
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,640
there let's hide as close to the houses we can and then ask the girl as soon as she comes out

98
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,560
and what if she doesn't come out snuffkin then we'll improvise little my so this is the famous plan

99
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,160
by the great snuffkin look if she doesn't come out of the house we'll just go up a knock on the door

100
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,400
once we're inside I'm sure we'll be able to tell what's really what I don't think it's a very

101
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,920
good idea what if she catches a spell on us little my will wait outside and if we don't come out she

102
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,200
can run back to moonman valley for help that's fine but moonman can wait outside and I'll search the

103
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,040
house oh no little my you can wait outside and I will search the house let's do it this way you stay

104
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,280
outside and if we get caught try to free us and run for help as quickly as you can only if you can't

105
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:43,280
is that okay that means if you're in trouble your lives will be in my hands that's right little

106
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,640
my I don't like this out of this I'm not sure I want little my to be my last home while I

107
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,800
wouldn't help anyone who doesn't trust me that's for sure you're that see what I mean

108
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,200
be quiet there's a house

109
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,160
look at this it's very quiet do you think there's anybody home I don't know let's wait a while and see

110
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:17,440
do we have to stay absolutely still but of course we do we'll feel extremely silly if the house is

111
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,840
empty they've disappeared they could have told us where they were going I'm sure I don't care

112
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:30,400
little my went to I think she's betrayed us that's just like her don't worry I've got a pretty good

113
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:36,400
idea where they were heading for you know where they've gone why didn't you tell me where are they

114
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:42,000
they've gone to the forest of witches what they've gone to see whether the woman we met yesterday's

115
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,280
a real witch a real one why don't we go there too I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find my way sniff

116
00:14:51,120 --> 00:15:02,160
what is it no it's my stomach I better lie down oh it's very painful oh how much longer we

117
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,760
can have to stay here like this this adventure isn't the least bit exciting well let's wait a

118
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,640
little bit longer be quiet at least we know the girl is definitely in there no we don't she

119
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,880
might be out she could be anywhere I know that's possible but I don't think so

120
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,600
she's getting some water as I thought that way she's working her to the bone hey little boy

121
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,160
she's following that girl you go with her movement and find out as much as you possibly can about

122
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:43,280
what's going on I'll watch the house right hey wait for me

123
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,280
oh

124
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:59,160
If you're looking for Alicia, she's up.

125
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,160
Stop! Listen, wait and see.

126
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,160
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

127
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Why did you try to run away then?

128
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
Oh, I'll help you with that.

129
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
So will I.

130
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,160
How kind of you. It is a bit heavy to carry, you know.

131
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,160
I think I remember your name. Is it Alicia?

132
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Yes, it is. I'm so glad you remembered it.

133
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
My name is Lohman.

134
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
And I'm Lohman.

135
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
What are you doing here in the forest of witches?

136
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,160
Well, to be perfectly honest, we came because we were rather worried about you.

137
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
What about me? Why is that?

138
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Is that a woman really your grandmother?

139
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
Of course.

140
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
You're quite sure?

141
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Yes, of course. She's my mother's mother. Why do you ask?

142
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
Well, don't you know?

143
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
He's trying to ask.

144
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
That's cool.

145
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Or maybe your grandmother is a witch.

146
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Yes, she is.

147
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Of course.

148
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Oh, I'm sorry. I was a bit taken aback.

149
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,160
You don't mind about your grandmother being a real witch?

150
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
Oh, no.

151
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,160
That's what she is. I was husband.

152
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
I'm going to be one, too, when I'm grown up.

153
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Oh, no. You couldn't.

154
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Well, you don't look anything like one.

155
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Well, that's because I'm not one yet.

156
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,160
When you're born into a witch family, that's what you become.

157
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,160
But it's not that easy, you know.

158
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,160
Oh, this is too much.

159
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,160
Now, tell me, what are you doing here in the forest of witches?

160
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
You don't sound like a witch.

161
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Oh, really? What do witches sound like?

162
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Well, to be honest, you're the first one I've ever met in my whole life.

163
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,160
I'm sure that's just what you think, young man.

164
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,160
Is it true that the nice girl is really your granddaughter?

165
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Certainly. A very promising young girl.

166
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Honest and hardworking, and with a lot of training, she will make an excellent witch someday.

167
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,160
But how can you possibly turn such a sweet girl into a witch?

168
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
The sweetest girls make the best witches.

169
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Hello, didn't know you were back, Grandma.

170
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,160
Thank you for getting the water, Alicia.

171
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,160
Oh, who's that?

172
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,160
I don't know. Some naive young man ought to rescue a damsel in distress now.

173
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,160
I remember you, your snuffkin.

174
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,160
Yes.

175
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,160
Your friend snuffkins in here, why don't you come in, too?

176
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,160
In the house?

177
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
Really?

178
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
He's brought friends with him, has he?

179
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Suffkin, whatever they're done to you.

180
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
I'll take care of that.

181
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Wait a second, I'll do it for you.

182
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
I'll fix it.

183
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Wait, I'm gonna need you again.

184
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Where are you going?

185
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,160
I don't think that snake ever got bitten before.

186
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
I'll get another.

187
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,160
I'm very curious, why are you three here, huh?

188
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,160
They came all the way from Moomin Valley because they were really worried about me, Grandma.

189
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
What about you?

190
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Yes, they thought you might be nasty to me, so they came all this way to see if I needed help.

191
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
This always happens.

192
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,160
People treat witches as if they weren't ordinary, respectable, responsible citizens.

193
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
No, no, we're very sorry.

194
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:10,160
We realize she's quite okay and she's most welcome to visit us in Moomin Valley at any time, isn't she snuffkin?

195
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Yes, certainly.

196
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,160
What? You said you'd visit these people?

197
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Yes, I thought I'd go over there sometimes after I finished with my homework, of course.

198
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
I would never leave my studies half done.

199
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Sorry, Alicia, but if you ever want to become a good witch, you mustn't see any ordinary mortals.

200
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Oh, why not? I've only just become friends with them, Grandma, please.

201
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,160
I know. Why don't I wait a year and study to be a witch next year?

202
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Alicia.

203
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,160
This is family business, so if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you were to leave.

204
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,160
And I'd like you to go immediately if you'd please.

205
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,160
It's snowing.

206
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:11,160
While she certainly won't be able to visit us at Moomin Valley is buried in snow, so we might never see her again.

207
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,160
No, that's right, and you'll be leaving soon, won't you snuffkin?

208
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,160
Winter had come once again to Moomin Valley.

209
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,160
It's snowing.

210
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:58,160
The Moons are having fun day after day, the Moons.

211
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,160
The Moons.

212
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:08,160
The Moons.
