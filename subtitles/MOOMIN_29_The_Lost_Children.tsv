0	21000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.
29000	36000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.
36000	41000	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever.
41000	46000	There were the movements, there were the movements,
46000	59000	there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.
59000	75000	Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
75000	80000	Woman and snorkemaiden were still fast asleep in the row and tree.
80000	88000	The sun was high in the sky and the floating theater had floated away a long time ago.
88000	99000	Oh, oh, oh, I feel so good, I really slept like a log all night.
99000	107000	It's so lovely to be out in the fresh air with movement and a tree in blue.
107000	114000	No, no, the house is gone, I mean the theater is gone.
114000	120000	Woman, wake up, there's been a catastrophe, wake up.
120000	126000	What's a catastrophe? Look down, the theaters floated off during the night.
126000	130000	I don't believe it.
138000	143000	It has, it's gone, I can't see it anywhere.
143000	146000	It must be far away by now.
146000	150000	Woman, your father's walking stick.
150000	156000	It must have got loose in the middle of the night while everybody was asleep.
159000	162000	Crying won't solve the problems, don't made him.
162000	168000	But we're stranded in the row and tree with water all around us.
174000	181000	Hmm.
181000	186000	Huh?
186000	189000	Huh?
189000	193000	Oh no, we're in a drift, we're floating away!
193000	196000	We're drifting away!
197000	201000	Oh, what are we going to do?
201000	206020	Bull men and snot maintenance are still up in that beautiful Rowan tree. That's just typical
206120	209000	Where is it and how can we have drifted so far away?
209720	215200	Listen last night didn't you I told you never to do that in the iterate brings bad look
231000	233000	Oh! Little Maya!
233000	235000	Oh my God!
235000	237000	Oh, no!
237000	239000	Oh, no!
239000	241000	Oh, dear!
241000	243000	Oh, little Maya!
243000	245000	Oh, get this hurry!
245000	247000	You're so mean!
247000	249000	Little Maya's drifting off.
249000	252000	Seems we're stranded, and that's not a bad thing.
252000	255000	The aiders shouldn't swim about like that.
262000	265000	Aren't you scared to get over to your side?
265000	267000	You must be brave, North Maiden!
267000	269000	I'll catch you so you won't fall, okay?
273000	275000	Oh!
276000	279000	I told you so, the branch didn't break, did it?
279000	281000	Thank you for saving me!
281000	285000	Whoa!
285000	287000	Ah!
288000	289000	Ah!
289000	291000	Are you all right, Moomin?
291000	293000	I can stand up, Snorke Maiden!
293000	295000	Look, the water's only ankle deep!
295000	297000	Really?
299000	301000	Ah!
301000	304000	Are you all right, Snorke Maiden?
304000	306000	Yes, it's so shallow.
311000	313000	Wonder where I'm gonna end up.
313000	316000	Doesn't matter, I rather like this boat.
316000	317000	I'm gonna make some noise.
317000	319000	I'll go back to sleep for a while.
326000	328000	It's getting dark, isn't it?
328000	330000	Oh?
334000	336000	Yes, try them!
336000	338000	Look there!
338000	339000	A fire!
339000	341000	Must be people over there.
341000	343000	Yes!
346000	351000	Of course I forgotten tonight's mid-summer eve!
377000	379000	What a strange catch!
393000	395000	So the Moomin's split up.
395000	397000	Are they in trouble, little Mai?
397000	400000	Yeah, seems I was probably the luckiest one as usual.
400000	402000	More!
402000	405000	I'm sorry you can't have anymore, that's all I have.
405000	408000	I don't believe you, your bag's still full.
408000	410000	Yes, but not with food, little Mai.
410000	412000	What's in it then?
412000	414000	You'll soon find out.
417000	418000	Where are we going?
418000	419000	To a park.
419000	422000	I hope there's a hot dog stand there.
436000	440000	Those two over there are the park keeper and his wife.
440000	442000	Look, they're always watching.
442000	446000	They guard a lot of poor orphans who come to the park every day.
446000	448000	Really?
448000	450000	Look over there!
454000	456000	Unbelievable!
466000	469000	Hey, what's this?
471000	473000	Hey kids!
473000	476000	Come on everybody, we're here to let you out!
476000	478000	Come quickly, hurry!
478000	479000	Huh?
479000	480000	We can't go anywhere.
480000	483000	We have to sit right here so they can see us.
483000	486000	Yeah, otherwise they might lose one of us.
486000	491000	What a lot of signs, no walking on grass, no shouting, no running!
491000	493000	What a lot of rules!
493000	495000	Why are they good for a snuffkin?
495000	496000	Nothing.
496000	497000	Nothing at all.
497000	500000	And that's why we're going to pull them up.
500000	501000	No, you mustn't.
501000	503000	I don't think one is allowed to do that.
503000	505000	And you have to walk on the grass.
505000	506000	Yes indeed.
506000	508000	And I really like walking on the grass.
508000	509000	I always have.
511000	512000	No buts.
512000	514000	Come on everybody, let's make a start.
515000	517000	That looks like fun, I'll pull some too.
523000	525000	What are you doing?
525000	526000	Can't you read?
526000	529000	There's a sign saying it's forbidden to pull a charge.
529000	530000	This one?
530000	531000	Yeah!
531000	533000	Oh, oh, oh!
533000	534000	Oh!
534000	535000	Oh!
535000	536000	Oh!
538000	539000	Oh!
539000	540000	Oh!
540000	541000	Oh!
541000	542000	Oh!
543000	544000	Oh!
544000	545000	Oh!
545000	547000	I'm beautiful sign!
547000	548000	Oh!
548000	549000	Bye bye!
549000	550000	Oh!
550000	551000	Oh!
551000	552000	Oh!
552000	553000	There you free!
553000	554000	Go run!
554000	555000	Okay!
560000	561000	Stop!
561000	562000	Wait!
562000	563000	Oh!
566000	567000	What the hell?
567000	568000	Oh!
568000	569000	My goodness!
569000	571000	Those little balls are shining!
573000	574000	Oh!
574000	575000	Oh!
575000	576000	Oh!
576000	577000	Oh!
577000	578000	Oh!
578000	579000	Oh!
579000	582000	Quick ride, those were hadipatmosies!
582000	584000	Come on everybody, run!
590000	592000	Oh, you got all of here!
592000	594000	Someone help!
594000	596000	Someone help!
596000	598000	The rest of me!
598000	599000	Get some!
599000	600000	Get away!
600000	601000	Quick!
601000	603000	They're terrible!
606000	609000	Where could that floating theater have gone?
609000	612000	They're still following us!
615000	618000	Come on, you kids, you can go wherever you want!
618000	619000	Do what you like!
619000	621000	Yeah, but I don't know what I want!
621000	622000	Me, me, sir!
622000	623000	No, me!
623000	626000	I think they want to go with you, Snuffkin!
626000	629000	But I don't know anything about small children.
629000	631000	I'm not sure I even like them!
631000	633000	All we have to do is find a theater!
633000	635000	Mum and Mama will know what to do!
635000	637000	In that case, let's go!
637000	638000	Mum!
638000	639000	Mum!
639000	640000	Mum!
640000	641000	Mum!
641000	642000	Mum!
642000	644000	Mum!
644000	645000	Mum!
649000	650000	Oh, house!
650000	651000	Yes, and look!
651000	653000	All the lights are on!
653000	655000	Maybe they're celebrating with some relief!
655000	656000	Shall we go there?
656000	657000	Yes!
658000	659000	Oh, house!
659000	660000	Yes, and look!
660000	661000	All the lights are on!
661000	664000	Maybe they're celebrating with some relief!
664000	665000	Shall we go there?
665000	666000	Yes!
678000	679000	Oh!
679000	680000	Oh!
680000	681000	Oh!
682000	683000	At last!
684000	685000	Oh!
685000	687000	Hello, happy midsummer!
687000	689000	Thank you!
689000	691000	Happy midsummer!
691000	693000	What can I do for you?
693000	696000	Would you have seen a theater drifting around somewhere, ma'am?
696000	697000	A theater?
697000	700000	Yes, you see it drifted away in the flood, and my powers are on it!
700000	701000	Oh, dear!
701000	703000	I haven't seen anything like that!
703000	705000	Oh, what a pity!
705000	706000	Thank you!
706000	707000	We'll look elsewhere!
707000	709000	Have a nice midsummer party!
709000	710000	Party?
710000	711000	Oh, yes, a party!
711000	713000	Thank you very much!
713000	714000	Very well, then!
714000	716000	I'll say goodnight!
718000	720000	Did we say something wrong, ma'am?
720000	722000	I don't know!
731000	733000	What's the matter?
733000	735000	I think she's crying!
735000	736000	Oh!
737000	738000	Hello!
738000	740000	Is there anything we can do, anything at all?
740000	742000	Aren't you having a party, ma'am?
742000	746000	No, unfortunately, she's not coming this year either!
746000	748000	Oh, is she?
748000	750000	My aunt and my father's side!
750000	754000	I invite her every year for a midsummer party, but she never comes!
754000	755000	How sad!
755000	757000	You must be very fond of her!
757000	759000	Oh, no! She's an awful person!
759000	763000	If that's how you feel about her, why don't you invite someone else?
763000	766000	She's my only relative!
766000	768000	So invite someone who isn't a relative?
768000	769000	Yes!
769000	771000	Why don't you invite us, for instance?
772000	774000	Oh!
774000	776000	Can one really do things like that?
776000	777000	Just like that?
777000	779000	Of course one can!
779000	780000	Oh, marvelous!
780000	782000	Don't be perfectly honest!
782000	784000	We're very hungry!
784000	787000	I've made lots of extra pancakes!
787000	789000	Please, come in and join me!
789000	791000	Thank you!
791000	795000	Although we have drifted apart tonight, is midsummer's eve?
795000	799000	Let's drink a toast to Mum and Snork Maiden and Little Mai
799000	800000	and hope that they're safe!
800000	803000	And we better drink to that no-good niece of mine, I guess!
803000	805000	Who's that, Emma?
805000	806000	My only relative!
806000	809000	She lives all alone in a small house by the sea!
809000	811000	Oh, is she all alone for midsummer?
811000	815000	Probably! I always invite me over for pancakes!
815000	820000	I don't like relatives, and I don't like pancakes, and she's boring, so I don't go!
820000	825000	Well, let's toast her anyway, and here's hoping we'll all be together again very soon!
825000	826000	Cheers!
826000	828000	Good health!
831000	833000	Oh, that was really good!
833000	834000	Everything was delicious!
834000	836000	I think I've eaten too much!
836000	838000	Oh, please have some more!
838000	839000	Oh, this is so nice!
839000	841000	I couldn't eat another thing!
841000	842000	Oh, sad!
842000	844000	It's such fun having someone to cook for!
844000	847000	I'm so pleased you're not at my door!
847000	849000	All that's missing now is a bonfire!
849000	852000	We always have one on midsummer eve!
852000	855000	What a good idea! Let's have one!
857000	858000	Over there!
861000	863000	Help! Help!
863000	866000	Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
866000	868000	So glad you came!
869000	872000	See these? The flood brought all of them!
872000	876000	They were lying all over the place, so I tied them into one big pile!
876000	878000	Would they make a good bonfire?
878000	880000	Oh, a terrific one!
880000	882000	Definitely!
891000	893000	Oh, wow!
909000	913000	We've walked for miles, but I can't see signs of a theater anywhere!
913000	916000	Oh, don't worry! We'll find it soon!
916000	917000	Huh?
917000	919000	And what's the matter with you?
919000	920000	I'm hungry!
920000	921000	Me too!
921000	922000	And me!
922000	924000	I can't walk anymore!
924000	926000	We don't have any food if you want food!
926000	928000	You'll have to look for it yourself!
931000	933000	Oh, don't cry!
933000	935000	Look over there, little lion!
935000	936000	What?
936000	938000	Over there, hidden behind the trees!
938000	939000	Whoa, I have!
939000	940000	And the lights are on!
940000	942000	We're safe!
950000	952000	Oh, look at that!
959000	964000	Hey, kids, you can't go eating other people's food!
964000	967000	You can if they are home, and it's just what's left over from a party?
967000	970000	In fact, I will have some myself!
970000	973000	It's amazing! I'm always so lucky!
974000	976000	Now we must pick nine flowers!
976000	978000	Why is that Snorke-Middon?
978000	979000	I don't really know!
979000	981000	It's always nine or seven of something!
981000	983000	Okay, nine flowers!
983000	985000	No, not the same kind!
985000	987000	You must pick nine different flowers!
987000	989000	A memory you do!
989000	992000	You turn around, and then you turn around!
992000	994000	And then you turn around!
994000	996000	And then you turn around!
996000	998000	And then you turn around!
998000	1000000	And then you turn around!
1000000	1002000	And then you turn around!
1002000	1005000	You turn around seven times like this!
1007000	1009000	I get it!
1022000	1027000	And then you walk backward until you reach a well!
1027000	1031000	And then, when you look down into the well,
1031000	1034000	there you'll see the man you're going to marry!
1034000	1037000	How did I get him up?
1037000	1040000	I think I see him! What a clever well!
1040000	1042000	That I must try!
1056000	1058000	I'd like someone more romantic!
1058000	1059000	Got you!
1059000	1061000	What are you doing?
1061000	1063000	I'm quietly now!
1063000	1066000	Oh, all we did is pick some unprotected wild flowers!
1066000	1068000	I know what you did!
1068000	1070000	Hey, Snorke-Middon!
1070000	1071000	Moonman!
1071000	1074000	Ha! You know each other! That makes it conspiracy!
1074000	1077000	But I tell you, we've done nothing wrong, nothing at all!
1077000	1079000	We were only celebrating!
1079000	1080000	Better for you, if you haven't!
1080000	1083000	But why? Can't you light a bonfire here, sir?
1083000	1087000	I must warn you that all you say will be used against you!
1088000	1090000	I have a complaint from the parkkeeper!
1090000	1093000	You pulled up these signs from his park and you burnt them!
1093000	1094000	That's not true!
1094000	1096000	It is true that we burnt them, sir,
1096000	1098000	but we didn't take them from any park!
1098000	1100000	They were brought here by the flood!
1100000	1102000	Older-dash! Here's the evidence!
1103000	1105000	I've caught you when that's that!
1112000	1114000	Oh, I caught something!
1115000	1117000	Oh, it's just a piece of wood!
1117000	1118000	Had any ideas here?
1118000	1121000	Not a single one. How about you, Mama?
1121000	1123000	Same here, I'm afraid.
1123000	1126000	I just can't seem to think of anything at all!
1133000	1136000	You wouldn't have any ideas about what we should do next, would you, Emma?
1136000	1137000	About what?
1137000	1141000	Some ideas about how to let the children know where we are, of course.
1142000	1143000	How does anyone?
1144000	1145000	No where a theater is.
1146000	1147000	I don't know.
1147000	1148000	Please tell us.
1149000	1150000	Well, you put on a play.
1151000	1152000	A play?
1152000	1153000	Yes, that is correct.
1153000	1156000	This is a theater, and when you put on a new play,
1156000	1158000	everybody comes walking to see it.
1158000	1161000	They come to laugh, to cry, to shout, and to applaud.
1161000	1164000	And when your children hear of it, they will be hearing a flash.
1164000	1166000	What a splendid idea, Emma!
1166000	1168000	That's exactly what we'll do.
1170000	1172000	I'm sorry, we can't put on a play.
1172000	1173000	Why not?
1173000	1177000	We have no actors. They are pests, but one can't do without them.
1177000	1179000	I can be one.
1179000	1181000	And I'm also quite good at acting.
1181000	1183000	I can act very well.
1183000	1187000	There are only three of you, and not one of you, is an experienced professional actor.
1187000	1190000	Don't forget, we have you, Emma.
1190000	1191000	Me?
1191000	1197000	Well, I've always felt that I would make a rather good Shakespearean heroine.
1197000	1201000	And we can each have many parts, as long as they're not all on the stage at the same time.
1201000	1203000	He isn't at so moment, Papa.
1203000	1205000	Of course, it's possible to do it.
1205000	1207000	I want the part that finds the treasure.
1207000	1210000	No, that's impossible. We have no play.
1210000	1213000	Nothing simple enough for the likes of you.
1213000	1217000	A moment, Papa, can write one. He's very talented.
1217000	1220000	No trouble at all, my dear. Any number of acts.
1220000	1223000	But we don't want any number. We want three acts.
1223000	1226000	That's what all proper plays always have, moment, Papa.
1226000	1227000	Let's start right away.
1227000	1229000	We got to print posters.
1229000	1230000	And clean the stage.
1230000	1232000	Whatever, if I started.
1232000	1234000	Aw.
1234000	1240000	And this was how a woman, Papa, got started on a short career as a playwright.
1260000	1272000	But while the birds carry news of the play far and wide,
1272000	1278000	what has to become of movement and snorkemaiden?
1278000	1282000	Their troubles are real ones.
1282000	1298000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1298000	1306000	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1306000	1310000	They're always happy and goes at play.
1310000	1314000	The movements are having fun day after day.
1314000	1318000	The movements.
1318000	1322000	The movements.
1322000	1328000	The movements.
1336000	1340000	The movements.
