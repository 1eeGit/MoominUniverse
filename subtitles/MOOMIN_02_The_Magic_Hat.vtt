05:26.800 --> 05:28.880

05:51.520 --> 05:56.400
where have you been snuffkin that's a big secret movement I won't tell anyone

05:56.400 --> 06:00.080
All right, it's the magic hat. It's on a sandbank further down the river.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.120
Gosh!

06:01.120 --> 06:03.120
But something terrible is happening.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.720
What? What is it?

06:09.360 --> 06:12.560
Oh dear, perhaps we shouldn't have thrown it in the river.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.840
It's too late now. Let's get there cooking.

06:15.840 --> 06:29.760
There it is. It's caught on a branch in the middle.

06:31.280 --> 06:36.320
Where? Oh, Smoughkin, I can see it. Look at the water. It's all red.

06:36.800 --> 06:40.400
Hmm, seems to be coming from the hat. I wonder what it is, Moong.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.800
I'll go and get it. Be careful.

06:42.800 --> 06:47.600
Shall I come too? No, you stay there.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.760
Have you got it? Uh-huh.

07:12.800 --> 07:19.280
Wow! It's raspberry juice.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.440
What should we do with the hat?

07:23.440 --> 07:26.400
Well, I don't think it's a good idea to leave it lying around.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.240
Somebody might crawl into it.

07:28.240 --> 07:32.000
But if we put water in it, we can have as much raspberry juice as we can drink.

07:32.720 --> 07:37.360
Well, that would be nice. But you know, Moong, it could only be river water that does that.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.400
You know what I mean, Moong?

07:39.120 --> 07:41.200
Well, I think it's worth experimenting.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.360
What's the matter, Moong? You look very tired.

07:45.360 --> 07:48.320
I woke up in the night and couldn't get back to sleep.

07:48.320 --> 08:09.280
Ha! Pardon? Couldn't get back to sleep. Ha! What are you talking about?

08:09.600 --> 08:11.520
I was awake last night too.

08:13.680 --> 08:16.080
And I know why you're so tired.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.440
You must have been dreaming.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.440
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.080
Thanks, Mama.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.120
Where are you going, Moong? Moong!

08:25.680 --> 08:28.320
Somewhere you can't come. Somewhere private.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.320
So, what was that all about, huh?

08:32.320 --> 08:34.640
Oh, nothing really important, Moong and Papa.

08:34.640 --> 08:38.960
I think I'll go out.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.400
Nobody hides anything from little, my.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.080
Snuffkin!

08:58.240 --> 09:04.080
Hey, I found out who's had it is.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.280
Who's?

09:05.280 --> 09:06.880
The Hobgoblins.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.080
The Hobgoblins?

09:08.080 --> 09:12.880
Yeah, I asked the Hemmielin and he told me that he saw him once long ago wearing that.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.280
I heard about the wizard who flies in the sky.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.280
Yeah, on the back of a black panther.

09:17.280 --> 09:21.280
The Hobgoblins is hundreds of years old and cares only for rubies.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.080
He rides all over the world, searching for them.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.080
He's truly awesome.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.880
And so, when he dropped his hat?

09:30.880 --> 09:35.280
He must have been looking for some rubies right here in Moong and Valley.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.080
Do you think he's got a lot of hats, Snuffkin?

09:38.080 --> 09:39.280
Gee, I don't know.

09:39.280 --> 09:43.280
Well, do you think perhaps he doesn't know where he dropped his hat?

09:43.280 --> 09:45.280
Yeah, I suppose that's possible.

09:45.280 --> 09:50.080
Snuffkin, there's something I would like to try with the hat.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.080
Just don't put it on. Will you?

09:58.080 --> 09:59.440
He's in there somewhere.

09:59.440 --> 10:02.080
Hat lions are pretty stupid, you know.

10:02.080 --> 10:06.880
Yes, Moong and Papa told me it takes him hours to dig themselves into the sand.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.280
Oh, no, it doesn't. It only takes the one hour.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.280
Only an hour? You're kidding.

10:11.280 --> 10:15.280
Well, of course, an hour is a long time to spend digging.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.280
Are you talking about me?

10:17.280 --> 10:22.080
Yes, about how quickly you could dig yourself into a hole in the sand.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.280
A lot quicker than you think it will take.

10:25.280 --> 10:29.280
Moong in here says it takes you only one hour to dig a hole in the sand,

10:29.280 --> 10:31.280
but I can't believe that.

10:31.280 --> 10:35.280
Snuffkin says it takes several hours, but I think he's wrong.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.280
I'll show you how long.

10:37.280 --> 10:41.280
Gosh, that was rather fast.

10:41.280 --> 10:45.280
Yeah, but it's obvious he's already got a ready-made hole hidden there.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.280
Don't you ant lion?

10:47.280 --> 10:51.280
No, I do not.

10:51.280 --> 10:55.280
I can dig myself in anywhere, anywhere at all.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.280
How about here?

11:03.280 --> 11:05.280
Yeah, okay. Under this rock.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.280
All right?

11:06.280 --> 11:08.280
Anywhere. Just show me.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.280
Okay, start from here.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.280
Yeah, just there, if you don't mind.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.280
All right, start counting.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.280
Dude!

11:19.280 --> 11:22.280
Wow, you only took a second and a half.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.280
He's really something, isn't he?

11:24.280 --> 11:26.280
He certainly is.

11:26.280 --> 11:28.280
I'd better sit on it.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.280
Yeah, he'll be really mad.

11:44.280 --> 11:47.280
So you've caught the ant lion. I've been watching.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.280
Little boy.

11:48.280 --> 11:49.280
Right.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.280
Did you follow us last night?

11:52.280 --> 11:53.280
Yes.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.280
Oh, did you tell the others?

11:55.280 --> 11:58.280
Oh, don't be silly you guys. I haven't said a word yet.

11:58.280 --> 12:01.280
But you will if we don't let you join in with us.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.280
That's what she's doing, movement.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.280
No, as if I do such a thing.

12:05.280 --> 12:08.280
Of course, I'm forgetting how nice and kind you are.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.280
Hey, what is that?

12:14.280 --> 12:16.280
Nope, no hat anywhere.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.280
There's gallons of water.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.280
Gosh, there sure must be a lot of sand in there.

12:33.280 --> 12:37.280
He must have changed into something else by now.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.280
Probably.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.280
There must have been long enough. Oh, jump off.

12:42.280 --> 12:46.280
He isn't strong enough to move the rock by himself.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.280
Shall we help him?

12:48.280 --> 12:49.280
No, don't.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.280
Come on, let's do it.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.280
What's happened to him?

12:57.280 --> 12:59.280
Let's turn it over.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.280
Oh, no, I can't look.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.280
Oh.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.280
It's a hedgehog.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.280
Oh, no, no, no.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.280
It's a hedgehog.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.280
It's a hedgehog.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.280
Oh, no!

13:42.280 --> 13:44.280
Oh, no!

13:58.280 --> 14:00.280
Movement.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.280
Oh, stop it.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.280
Don't push me, Lucy.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.280
Why?

14:08.280 --> 14:09.280
Movement.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.280
Movement.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.280
Movement, I just saw the Hobgoblin.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.280
What?

14:37.280 --> 14:39.280
It must have been him.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.280
Do you think he was looking for his hat?

14:41.280 --> 14:42.280
I'm afraid so.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.280
I hope you hit it well.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.280
The seller.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.280
Will it be safe there?

14:48.280 --> 14:52.280
Well, only little my and us two know where it is.

15:00.280 --> 15:01.280
Hmm.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.280
The red?

15:04.280 --> 15:09.280
I wonder if it's possible to change it into spaghetti.

15:24.280 --> 15:27.280
Hmm, not exactly spaghetti.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.280
Mama.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.280
Mama.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.280
There's something I think you ought to know.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.280
What is it, dear?

15:39.280 --> 15:42.280
There are strange things happening in the house.

15:42.280 --> 15:43.280
In the house?

15:43.280 --> 15:45.280
There's a tree in the seller.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.280
A tree?

15:46.280 --> 15:48.280
That's nice.

15:50.280 --> 15:53.280
What did you say, a real tree?

15:53.280 --> 15:56.280
Yes, and it seems to be growing and growing.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.280
What have you done, little my?

15:58.280 --> 16:01.280
Just dropped a bit of thread into the magic hat.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.280
But movement threw it away.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.280
Yeah, we did.

16:04.280 --> 16:07.280
But we sort of found it again and put it in the seller.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.280
Oh, dear.

16:09.280 --> 16:12.280
We must tell movement papa before it's too late.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.280
Come in.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.280
It's not locked.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.280
Keep going, tree.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.280
You can grow as big as you like.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.280
And just tell me if you're thirsty or anything.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.280
And how about some fruit soon?

16:35.280 --> 16:37.280
I really like pears.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.280
Come in.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.280
I'm very sorry to disturb you, papa.

16:44.280 --> 16:45.280
What is it?

16:45.280 --> 16:48.280
Well, it's not good.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.280
What do you mean, not good?

16:50.280 --> 16:53.280
I think you'd better come down and have a look at once.

16:53.280 --> 16:57.280
So you can see for yourself what's happening before it's too late.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.280
Too late?

16:59.280 --> 17:01.280
Well, that sounds a bit ominous.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.280
Don't worry. I'll sort it out.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.280
Whatever the catastrophe.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.280
Now, listen you.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.280
You leave my husband's desk alone.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.280
Or you'll be sorry.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.280
All right, dear.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.280
I'm coming.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.280
Well, this is definitely a catastrophe.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.280
I think you'd better get me a saw, Mama.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.280
Oh, what's yo?

17:25.280 --> 17:30.280
Everything's in the cellar, and it would be a bit difficult to get in there now, woman, papa.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.280
They'll never mind. We haven't got time.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.280
I'll break them by hand.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.280
Gee, look at moving house.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.280
Come on, Snork Maiden. This is fun.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.280
But what happened, little Mai?

17:58.280 --> 18:00.280
I've been gardening, that's all.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.280
Aren't I clever?

18:09.280 --> 18:12.280
Well, this catastrophe is going on too long.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.280
I'm hungry.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.280
Look on the bright side, papa.

18:16.280 --> 18:19.280
It could be a long time before we run out of firewood.

18:19.280 --> 18:21.280
There, take that.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.280
Oh, oh.

18:22.280 --> 18:25.280
That'll teach you to try and take over moment house.

18:30.280 --> 18:33.280
Papa, look at all these lovely flowers.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.280
And fruit.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.280
Papa, papa, you must try some.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.280
Oh, they're lovely and juicy.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.280
Oh, no.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.280
Little Mai must have put something into the hat.

19:02.280 --> 19:05.280
Woman, where are you, woman?

19:05.280 --> 19:07.280
Here I am.

19:07.280 --> 19:11.280
Oh, woman, I was afraid that you were inside the house.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.280
Mama, papa, little Mai.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.280
They can't get out.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.280
We'll need some saws and axes.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.280
We must all be in the cellar and we can't get in this way.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.280
We must try and find another way.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.280
All right, I'll run and get some help.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.280
You do not have to, little one.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.280
Are you the hobgoblin, sir?

19:36.280 --> 19:37.280
I am he.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.280
I can see that you have found my hat.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.280
Yes, sir.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.280
It was on top of the mountain.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.280
I think the...

19:45.280 --> 19:48.280
That tree seems to be doing remarkably well.

19:51.280 --> 19:54.280
However, away with thee.

20:08.280 --> 20:11.280
Oh, my goodness, me.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.280
Oh, my goodness.

20:23.280 --> 20:27.280
That really is some hat you have there, Mr. Hobgoblin.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.280
I'm sorry, I troubled you.

20:29.280 --> 20:33.280
We're just glad you came along when you did, Mr. Hobgoblin.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.280
You're most kind, madam.

20:35.280 --> 20:39.280
I don't suppose you'd have any uncommonly large rubies here, would you?

20:39.280 --> 20:42.280
You finding my hat here must be an omen.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.280
Here you are, Mr. Hobgoblin.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.280
My husband, Moomin, Papa gave it to me.

20:52.280 --> 20:58.280
It is fine indeed, and you are lucky to have it, but I'm afraid it is not the King's Ruby I am looking for.

20:58.280 --> 21:01.280
What do you mean, King's Ruby?

21:01.280 --> 21:04.280
I have searched for it for hundreds of years, Moomin, Mama.

21:04.280 --> 21:08.280
I'm afraid I am obsessed by it and cannot find it anywhere.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.280
Well, if we see it, we'll light a signal fire.

21:11.280 --> 21:15.280
You are most kind, madam, and I feel we shall meet again soon.

21:26.280 --> 21:29.280
He's not bad for Hobgoblin.

21:33.280 --> 21:36.280
Come on, everybody. Let's start stacking up all this wood.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.280
Oh, King, let's do it!

21:52.280 --> 21:56.280
And so the Hobgoblin's hat finally disappeared from Moomin Valley.

21:56.280 --> 22:00.280
Moomin rather missed having an ever-ending supply of raspberry juice,

22:00.280 --> 22:04.280
but his parents were more than happy that it had gone.

22:07.280 --> 22:14.280
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomin's.

22:14.280 --> 22:21.280
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

22:21.280 --> 22:25.280
They're always happy and always at play.

22:25.280 --> 22:32.280
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

22:33.280 --> 22:37.280
The Moomin's.

22:37.280 --> 22:44.280
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomin's.

22:44.280 --> 22:51.280
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

22:51.280 --> 22:55.280
They're always happy and always at play.

22:55.280 --> 23:02.280
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

23:02.280 --> 23:06.280
The Moomin's.

23:06.280 --> 23:12.280
The Moomin's.
