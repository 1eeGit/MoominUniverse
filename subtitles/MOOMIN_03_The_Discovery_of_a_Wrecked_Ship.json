like to do that one day let's go then shall we little my wanted to come but I told you it was too dangerous hmm perhaps it wasn't the best thing to say look I'm not climbing up there well I am wouldn't you like to keep me company instead look there's a cave just a little bit further along this path why don't you two girls wait for a sec we won't be long but if you can walk to it why on earth climb to it difficult for a girl to understand well I think boys are difficult to understand we're not sure we can reach it from above well we'll soon find out are you coming with a sniff oh I think I'll guard the rear protect the cave from below oh yeah well someone has to look after the girls someone responsible oh my goodness it's dark in there let's go in then I don't like the look of it we'd better stay out here you never know who might live in there don't be silly no one lives in there that's what I don't like yes exactly a place with no one living in it is really scary I think we must be right above the cave here maybe I can't find a hole though let's look a bit more over that way moving wow I've never seen a shell like this before look at that one they must be worth a fortune come over here and look little mine where's little my snorke made and she went into the cave sniff oh no she can't do that it might be dangerous little my little my come out no you come in

stay here alone I suppose so let's go shall I hold your hand in case you get frightened little my where are you stop it please you're frightening snorke maiden oh really I thought I was frightening you your voice is so shaky oh wait I sound normally hey be quiet no I can hear something me too perhaps it's the wind no snorke maiden it sounds like someone moaning you can't scare me like that no one lives here who want to live here anyway it's dark and cold it's moment and snuffkin they've climbed out and we can hear their voices in the distance so we needn't worry why would they be moaning no it's not them I'm gonna go and investigate don't little my please please stop it oh pull hard movement will this do right who's going first me okay but please be careful I will oh take it easy movement there's no hurry hey are you all right movement yes of course oh movement what's happened talk to me movement are you all right oh I don't know I think so my bottom's a little bit sore though I'm sure I heard somebody scream just now well the hamilin was down here having a nap the hamilin if this is another of your games movement I don't like Mr. Hamilin we were climbing down from the top we didn't know you were asleep that's not quite right I wasn't asleep I wasn't at all comfortable you know well what were you doing here then well to tell you the truth I really haven't been quite myself lately you haven't lost any more rare stabs have you Mr. Hamilin on the contrary movement I have them all even the rarest every single one then what's wrong that's good isn't it I mean my collection is complete I know one in the world has a better stamp collection than you have Mr. Hamilin no of course not mine is perfect there isn't a stamp I haven't got rare ones old ones misprinted ones I have them all I still don't understand there's no challenge nothing to search for you're too young and you don't collect stamps oh dear me dear me I'm beginning to understand he's not a collector anymore he's got all the stamps he could ever want that's the trouble it's not half as much fun that's why you're sad isn't it Mr. Hamilin yes it is no fun no fun at all now I understand I can see why you're upset and me falling on top of you like that didn't really help did it not exactly moment look who was taking a nap in the cave oh it's you Mr. Hamilin so it must have been his snoring that we heard what a noise he was making I'd never ever snore you certainly do Robbys look if you promise not to tell anyone I'll take you to see something very special what is it I think it could be repaired of course it could easy but you know you can't always tell the keel doesn't look too good yes we could take it out to see a no time the sales got holes in it hey I can't find any owners you can paddle all steer look out friends it's going over hey hang on everybody I've lost my confidence and it makes me feel very unhappy well it can happen to anyone you know even to you well not much of course lucky you I just don't know what to do how can I get it back there must be a way it's hard to say everybody's different but with me it just happens I don't think I'll ever invent anything again perhaps I'll have a break from my memoirs too tea time oh dear what's the matter with you too you look a bit down in the dance you know I might have been a bit overconfident me too I think there's no need to yell we can hear you watch the matter sniff we found a boat on the beach coming have a look a shipwreck washed up on the shore it's not a wreck and it's got a white sail oh we're going to repair it and then it'll be ours all right I'm coming come on snort let's take a look at this boat it could be just the thing to cheer us both up so it's got a sail a white sail you say that could be extremely interesting hmm it's a sturdy little craft is nicely built well designed she's abandoned so does that we can keep her well it seems to be in pretty good condition except for the hole in the bottom you know maybe that's why she was abandoned here you could be right stuff can finders keepers you guys of course it makes it our boat you'd have to wait to see if anyone claims it first little mine what shall we do then papa well first things first we must repair the hole and then tire up securely in case there's a storm absolutely then if the owner comes we are to give her back to him mine you might know she's here so what are we going to do when we've repaired her oh it's bad for boats not to be yours don't we could sail the seven seas I'd be happy just to explore around here don't worry snort maiden if we get big waves we can sail between them isn't that right moment papa well in a way now come on let's get to work how about you snort will you help us yes of course can I do anything for you moment papa yes if you'd like to Mr. Himmelon well I'm afraid I'm not much of a builder but if there is something I could do well let's get her out of the water first shall we and we'll need some big logs to go under her I think ten should be enough I'll be so let's go prime she'll need to be safe to work on so we'll want something strong to keep her upright as well and lots of tools now go home and get some and I think we'll need a bucket and a shovel or I'll come with you help you choose yes you go I'll stay and keep guard in case the owner comes back sleep well man the top cells what are they all in bed my dear yes dear sleeping like logs I'm not surprised they all work very very hard today I can't wait until the boat's ready and we can sail off somewhere my dear will go anywhere in the world you like anywhere at all you've only got to say enough will jolly will go it doesn't have to be far dear let's get to bed too we've got an early start the morning oh intellectuals like me aren't used to this artwork oh I'm tired out and I can hardly move mama I better put these tired legs tonight dear movement papa this will be good for him I think oh dear oh dear a perfect fit if I may say so yeah well now for the rest of her right look at me movement I'm doing the tarring I know little my I'm only doing where you can't reach oh all right then sniff you lazy land lever bring me some or tar I won't get it yourself you lazy thing you wanted to do it I didn't want to carry tar though and anyway I'm the painter come on hurry up moment mama should I cut it all out yes please snook me hey feeling all right mr. hemmylin yes thank you you're fixing the boat very quickly yeah we sure are should be finished very soon yes I'm sure it will that's what I was afraid of what shall I do then snuff can well maybe you can start collecting something else what you think something else like what well I don't know anything really how about butterflies no my second cousin does that and he's a complete idiot it has to be something interesting ornaments ornaments yeah you could collect those forever not scientific well it's up to you but I think you really ought to collect something mr. hemmylin uh mama mama quick hurry up we're gonna launch the new boat all right wait for me I'm coming the sail you men it is perfect mama come on how you ready everybody I'll count to three then pushes hot as you can one two three and so with their new boat finally repaired and uncleaned movement and the others began to get very excited about their

Rosa Robeganosa that's great good for you snork maiden I've just had a new idea for my flying ship I'm certain it'll work this time of course it will snork good luck I better get on all right start
