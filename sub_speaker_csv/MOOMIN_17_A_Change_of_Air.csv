330000,333000,"The tough question is, why would the monster do that?",329700,330100,"SPEAKER_00"
333000,337000,"One is led to believe that it wants us to think it's still here.",329700,330100,"SPEAKER_00"
337000,341000,"Well, in fact, it has gone back to wherever it came from.",329700,330100,"SPEAKER_00"
341000,344000,"Fiddle battle, as my dear mother would say.",329700,330100,"SPEAKER_00"
344000,347000,"But why would it want us to think that, Papa?",342000,344300,"SPEAKER_04"
347000,349000,"It's a spy.",347000,347300,"SPEAKER_13"
349000,350000,"Oh, it's a spy.",347800,348800,"SPEAKER_09"
350000,351000,"Something it shouldn't.",349600,355300,"SPEAKER_09"
351000,355000,"It'd hardly be a good spy if we knew they have to sneak in and out.",349600,355300,"SPEAKER_09"
356000,360000,"I think it's still here. I can feel it. You know what I mean?",355700,356300,"SPEAKER_09"
361000,363000,"Perhaps tonight.",356300,359800,"SPEAKER_02"
363000,365000,"Tonight? What about tonight?",361200,362500,"SPEAKER_09"
365000,369000,"That's when they'll attack. It's gone back to give its report.",364400,365400,"SPEAKER_02"
369000,371000,"How do you know that, Papa?",368800,370400,"SPEAKER_13"
371000,375000,"Well, obviously, that's why it still wants us to believe it's here.",371000,371300,"SPEAKER_13"
375000,376000,"Mama, Mama!",374700,375500,"SPEAKER_13"
376000,378000,"Yes, what is it, Moome?",375500,375500,"SPEAKER_02"
378000,380000,"Something terrible is going to happen.",378000,382200,"SPEAKER_02"
380000,382000,"A monster is going to attack us tonight.",378000,382200,"SPEAKER_02"
382000,385000,"And Papa's excited about it.",378000,382200,"SPEAKER_02"
385000,388000,"Oh, good. That's nice for him.",384900,387100,"SPEAKER_05"
389000,391000,"Hurry, everyone.",384900,387100,"SPEAKER_05"
391000,394000,"I expect the monster will be here soon.",389200,393500,"SPEAKER_09"

4e+05,403000,"Now hold it still.",4e+05,400100,"SPEAKER_13"
404000,407000,"This is going to be a good barricade, don't you think?",400400,400400,"SPEAKER_10"

407000,410000,"We'd better make sure it's big enough.",407000,409200,"SPEAKER_09"
411000,415000,"It's hardly any fun at all playing tricks on them. They're so gullible.",410000,414900,"SPEAKER_02"
417000,421000,"If we catch the monster, we can sell it to a zoo.",417000,417300,"SPEAKER_02"
421000,423000,"I'll handle the sale, of course.",417600,422900,"SPEAKER_02"
423000,426000,"I'd rather tame it and keep it as a pet.",417600,422900,"SPEAKER_02"
427000,430000,"We could ride on it to go pig-nicking.",426900,430200,"SPEAKER_09"
440000,443000,"Alright, now for the moat. Here we go.",433900,434600,"SPEAKER_03"
443000,446000,"Hope the well's got enough water in it.",433900,434600,"SPEAKER_03"
447000,450000,"It'll be able to swim in this, Papa.",444900,447100,"SPEAKER_02"
450000,454000,"Yes, it'll remind you to the sea and keep it calm.",448900,450700,"SPEAKER_02"
454000,458000,"This is fresh water, Papa. We'd better put some salt in it.",453100,455300,"SPEAKER_13"
458000,460000,"Good idea, Moome.",456100,459000,"SPEAKER_09"
460000,463000,"We'll plant some seaweed and put some rocks in too,",456100,459000,"SPEAKER_09"
463000,466000,"and then it'll feel really at home.",460400,463300,"SPEAKER_13"
467000,469000,"I wonder when it'll come.",464200,470200,"SPEAKER_09"
469000,472000,"I don't know, but I can feel in my bones it'll be tonight.",464200,470200,"SPEAKER_09"
472000,474000,"And we keep watching till it comes?",464200,470200,"SPEAKER_09"
474000,476000,"Of course we will, constantly.",464200,470200,"SPEAKER_09"
476000,479000,"What if it doesn't come till tomorrow night or the night after that?",464200,470200,"SPEAKER_09"
479000,484000,"It might be a long wait, so we'll take it in turns and remember everybody.",478900,482300,"SPEAKER_09"
484000,487000,"The safe way is to keep it calm.",482500,484500,"SPEAKER_13"

499000,501000,"We must be ready.",492100,492200,"SPEAKER_13"
519000,522000,"Look at what those fools have done.",516500,517600,"SPEAKER_10"
522000,525000,"It was worth all the trouble.",519600,524600,"SPEAKER_02"
530000,532000,"Look, they put down food as bait.",530000,541900,"SPEAKER_02"
532000,534000,"Moome and Papa must be worn out.",530000,541900,"SPEAKER_02"
534000,537000,"Well, I'll take the food anyway.",530000,541900,"SPEAKER_02"
537000,538000,"Carefully, does it?",530000,541900,"SPEAKER_02"
538000,540000,"Don't want to wake up the guard.",530000,541900,"SPEAKER_02"
540000,542000,"This is great.",530000,541900,"SPEAKER_02"
