WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:46.000 --> 00:58.000
There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.400
Clap Clap Clap Clap

01:17.480 --> 01:20.100
Clap Clap, and then clap

01:22.320 --> 01:25.300
Pap dap dap dap bap bap

01:28.380 --> 01:31.920
Pap dap dap, tap dap bap bap bap

01:37.700 --> 01:41.560
Have you ever heard of Moon & Valley...

01:41.560 --> 01:50.440
In winter, deep white snow covers the whole valley, and everyone goes to sleep so that they

01:50.440 --> 01:52.640
keep warm.

01:52.640 --> 02:03.760
Look, there's a woman house.

02:03.760 --> 02:11.480
There's a woman, our hero.

02:11.480 --> 02:20.920
A woman, Papa, and a woman, Mama.

02:20.920 --> 02:34.440
And this little bundle must be little my.

02:34.440 --> 02:41.440
I think before our story starts, we better wake everyone up with some spring sunshine.

03:04.440 --> 03:14.440
At last, it's spring.

03:14.440 --> 03:21.440
Wake up everyone, it's spring time.

03:21.440 --> 03:38.440
Oh, little my, you're up.

03:38.440 --> 03:44.440
It's hard to stay asleep with you yelling, I can't help it if I'm happy.

03:44.440 --> 03:50.040
So yeah woke me, I was having a lovely dream about living in a watermelon, but it's beautiful

03:50.040 --> 03:51.040
outside.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.040
Oh gee, isn't it, is it really moving?

03:54.040 --> 03:59.040
Yes, it's all fresh, the flowers are out and the sun is shining.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.040
So, I like being asleep.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.040
But it's spring.

04:02.040 --> 04:05.040
You said you wanted me to wake you as soon as spring was here.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.040
Oh boy, did I?

04:07.040 --> 04:09.040
Yes, you did, little my.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.040
You said you wanted to be a welcome as soon as spring was here.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.040
Really?

04:13.040 --> 04:15.040
Yes, you did.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.040
Did I say something like that?

04:18.040 --> 04:20.040
I can go back to bed if you want to.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.040
Nobody's making you get up, little my.

04:22.040 --> 04:25.040
No, there's really no point, movement.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.040
I'm not sleepy anymore.

04:26.040 --> 04:29.040
Well, there you are then.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.040
Mama!

04:31.040 --> 04:33.040
Good spring, movement.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.040
Movement, mama.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.040
I'm starving.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.040
Have you got any watermelon?

04:37.040 --> 04:40.040
No, but there's lots of other things.

04:40.040 --> 04:44.040
We'll all have a nice big breakfast.

04:48.040 --> 04:51.040
I can hear a snuff gun.

05:05.040 --> 05:09.040
Wouldn't it be quicker to use the stairs?

05:09.040 --> 05:11.040
More fun this way.

05:11.040 --> 05:14.040
Are you going home now?

05:14.040 --> 05:15.040
Yes.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.040
Thanks very much for letting me spend the winter here.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.040
Don't think your sister will be back yet, though.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.040
I'll go anyway.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.040
Snuff gun!

05:31.040 --> 05:33.040
Oh, hello, movement.

05:33.040 --> 05:36.040
It's really good to see you, snuff gun.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.040
And you too?

05:37.040 --> 05:38.040
You're back, Arlie.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.040
Won't you have a good time?

05:40.040 --> 05:42.040
Yes, I was.

05:42.040 --> 05:45.040
But I didn't want to miss springtime and movement valley.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.040
What did you do?

05:47.040 --> 05:49.040
I'll tell you later.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.040
Let's go wake up, Snuff, and think of something exciting to do.

05:52.040 --> 05:55.040
I don't think I'll like it.

06:03.040 --> 06:06.040
He's still snoring, movement.

06:06.040 --> 06:09.040
I'll do it again.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.040
Well, that's done it.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.040
Come on, Snuff, it's spring.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.040
Snuff gun's here.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.040
Please go away, you two.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.040
We're going to do something really exciting.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.040
Like what, moment?

06:26.040 --> 06:29.040
I can think of more exciting things to do than this.

06:29.040 --> 06:33.040
Well, let's imagine that we're the first ever to climb this mountain.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.040
It's such a clear day.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.040
We'll be able to see all the movement valley when we get to the top and the sea.

06:40.040 --> 06:43.040
Good morning, Mr. Hemiolens.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.040
Morning, moment.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.040
Are your father and mother up?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.040
Yes.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.040
Mama was when I came out.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.040
Good.

06:52.040 --> 06:56.040
I'll never understand how you can sleep for months on end.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.040
We like it.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.040
Oh, yes.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.040
Why do they always have to do something exciting?

07:13.040 --> 07:15.040
What a gorgeous view.

07:15.040 --> 07:18.040
It really is.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.040
Hey, look, they're smoke coming from moment house.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.040
We should have stayed at home.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.040
My bet moment, Mama's cooking something good.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.040
Look.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.040
What is it?

07:29.040 --> 07:31.040
We're not the first here after all.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.040
Look over there.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.040
A top hat.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.040
Hmm, a rather large one.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.040
I wonder who's how it is.

07:46.040 --> 07:50.040
I don't know, but I know papa would like it.

07:51.040 --> 07:55.040
Hmm, it's much too big.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.040
Look.

07:59.040 --> 08:02.040
Oh dear, what's that?

08:02.040 --> 08:06.040
I can really get inside it.

08:06.040 --> 08:11.040
You see, I cover for my old one.

08:11.040 --> 08:14.040
Oh, oh, oh.

08:14.040 --> 08:18.040
Oh, I can't woman it.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.040
Stuck, woman.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.040
No, that's enough nonsense.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.040
I think I'll take it off now.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.040
Oh, damn.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.040
What's the matter?

08:32.040 --> 08:35.040
I can't move it. It's stuck, woman.

08:38.040 --> 08:40.040
I'll give you a hand.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.040
It's harder.

08:43.040 --> 08:45.040
Oh, oh.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.040
Oh, that's better.

08:48.040 --> 08:49.040
Thank you.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.040
What's all this noise?

08:51.040 --> 08:53.040
Papa's head got stuck in the hat, Mama.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.040
Oh, yes, and where did that come from?

08:55.040 --> 08:56.040
Oh, a moment, Mama.

08:56.040 --> 09:00.040
The children found it when they were out and brought it back for me.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.040
It's very smart.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.040
What shall we do with it, Papa?

09:05.040 --> 09:07.040
There is something strange about it.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.040
Shall I throw it away then?

09:09.040 --> 09:12.040
Oh, no. It's too good for that.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.040
Do we know anyone with a very big hand?

09:14.040 --> 09:17.040
No, woman, Papa.

09:17.040 --> 09:20.040
I know what we can do with it.

09:20.040 --> 09:23.040
Oh, it's a...

09:23.040 --> 09:25.040
A waste paper basket, Mama, Mama.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
That's right. Well done, Snuffkin.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.040
That was easy.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.040
Come on, Snuffkin.

09:31.040 --> 09:34.040
Come and have some breakfast with us.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.040
Hmm, beautiful.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.040
Hmm, beautiful.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.040
Yes.

10:10.040 --> 10:13.040
Sorry to disturb you, but I'm going to see women.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.040
Uh-huh.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.040
Do you want to come with me, Snork?

10:16.040 --> 10:17.040
Uh-huh.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.040
Or would you rather stay here?

10:19.040 --> 10:20.040
Uh-huh.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.040
Well, are you coming or not?

10:22.040 --> 10:23.040
Uh-huh.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.040
Not coming, man?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.040
Uh-huh.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.040
Snork?

10:27.040 --> 10:30.040
Well, you know my flying ship is almost finished.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.040
It'll be ready this year. You'll see.

10:32.040 --> 10:35.040
This isn't his target moment.

10:36.040 --> 10:39.040
Whoa!

10:39.040 --> 10:41.040
Oh, dear.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.040
Perhaps it needs a little more work.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.040
I wonder if you really can make a flying ship.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.040
Don't be silly, of course you can't.

10:52.040 --> 10:55.040
A little, my Snorks always dreamed about doing it.

10:55.040 --> 10:58.040
Dreams are all right.

10:58.040 --> 11:01.040
Yes, as long as they're not impossible.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.040
I suppose so.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.040
Hmm.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.040
Sniff, you're not still feeding your face, are you?

11:10.040 --> 11:12.040
Do you ever dream, Sniff?

11:12.040 --> 11:16.040
Only nightmares about having no food at all, little my.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.040
Hmm. I wonder who dropped this.

11:25.040 --> 11:28.040
Now where can I put it?

11:28.040 --> 11:30.040
Oh.

11:30.040 --> 11:33.040
There you are. Just a thing.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.040
Oh.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.040
Wow.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.040
Golly, what are they?

12:10.040 --> 12:11.040
They're clouds.

12:11.040 --> 12:14.040
Be careful. Don't touch it. It might be poisonous.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.040
It feels like cotton.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.040
Well, ee!

12:18.040 --> 12:21.040
This is great. I'm floating. Wonderful.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.040
Can I try?

12:27.040 --> 12:30.040
Are you ready, Snork Maiden?

12:30.040 --> 12:32.040
Here we go.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.040
What if you go too high?

12:38.040 --> 12:41.040
My phone.

12:41.040 --> 12:44.040
Wait for me.

12:44.040 --> 12:47.040
Hey, wait for me.

12:47.040 --> 12:50.040
Whoa.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.040
Hey, wait for me.

12:52.040 --> 12:55.040
Hey, wait for me.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.040
Hey, wait for me.

12:57.040 --> 13:00.040
Let me get on.

13:00.040 --> 13:04.040
Ow. Ow. I'm falling.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.040
Ow.

13:09.040 --> 13:14.040
Woman Papa is in his study trying to write his memoirs.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.040
A lot has happened to him over the years.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.040
An awful lot.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.040
And he's trying to remember it.

13:28.040 --> 13:31.040
What was that?

13:32.040 --> 13:33.040
Woman.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.040
Hi, Papa.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.040
What are you doing out there?

13:36.040 --> 13:37.040
We're flying.

13:37.040 --> 13:40.040
The clouds just came out of the house.

13:40.040 --> 13:44.040
Try and get nearer so I can reach you.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.040
No, I'm alright.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.040
Why don't you come for a ride?

13:48.040 --> 13:49.040
Stop. Wait a minute.

13:49.040 --> 13:52.040
It's great. You feel like a bird.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.040
Woman.

13:54.040 --> 13:57.040
Come on, Papa. Jump or you'll fall.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.040
It's alright.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.040
Oh.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.040
What?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.040
Oh.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.040
Woman, Mama, quickly.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.040
What's the matter?

14:08.040 --> 14:10.040
Have you seen what the children are doing?

14:10.040 --> 14:11.040
Yes.

14:11.040 --> 14:14.040
Look at them. They're flying about on clouds.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.040
It can't be safe.

14:15.040 --> 14:18.040
Don't worry, Papa. It's alright.

14:18.040 --> 14:22.040
I told them to be careful.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.040
Come on, Snapping.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.040
To go out.

14:28.040 --> 14:31.040
I won, I won.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.040
Whoa. Hey, wait a minute.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.040
Little cloud. Wait for me.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.040
Don't go away.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.040
Oh, I got you.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.040
That is tree cotton.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.040
I'm going to climb right up here.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.040
And I'm going to get you right there.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.040
This branch. Come on.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.040
Come on, little cloud.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.040
I'm going to take you with me.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.040
Here, come on.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.040
You just keep coming back here.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.040
Yeah.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.040
I got you now.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.040
You are going to get away from me.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.040
Here I go.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.040
Come on.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.040
All of that ledge.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.040
Come on.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.040
Stop.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.040
I want you to play.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.040
Oh.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.040
Oh.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.040
Oh, boy. What's happening?

15:07.040 --> 15:09.040
My cloud's starting to go.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.040
Oh.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.040
Whoa. Whoa.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.040
That was fun.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.040
Yeah, it was.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.040
But I wasn't ready to stop.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.040
Look.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.040
There's movement in Snork Maiden.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.040
Hey.

15:18.040 --> 15:22.040
Why have they still got cloud snuffed in?

15:22.040 --> 15:24.040
There's a starting to go as well.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.040
I think they'd better get off.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.040
Hey.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.040
Right.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.040
I'll start counting.

15:40.040 --> 15:45.040
One, two, three.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.040
Do you want something little mind?

15:48.040 --> 15:49.040
Oh, yes.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.040
A place to hide.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.040
Boy, I don't think there's any place to hide.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.040
And here is there.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.040
No.

16:06.040 --> 16:09.040
Oh, it's too dirty in there.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.040
I'm going to have.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.040
I know.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.040
I'll hide in the head.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.040
Oh.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.040
One, two, one, two, one.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.040
Hey.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.040
Hey.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.040
Huh?

16:39.040 --> 16:40.040
Huh?

16:52.040 --> 16:53.040
Gotcha.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.040
Snork Maiden.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.040
Snork Maiden.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.040
Hey.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.040
Baaah!

17:21.040 --> 17:23.040
Baaah!

17:23.040 --> 17:26.040
Movement must be around here somewhere.

17:26.040 --> 17:30.040
Well, last time I saw him, he was hiding in the fireplace.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.040
Have you found him yet?

17:31.040 --> 17:32.040
No.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.040
Have you looked in the cellar?

17:34.040 --> 17:35.040
Yes, I have.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.040
Wait a minute.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.040
Did you hear someone laughing?

17:40.040 --> 17:41.040
Where'd it come from?

17:41.040 --> 17:44.040
Gee, I better go home.

17:44.040 --> 17:46.040
Oh, is there anything wrong?

17:46.040 --> 17:47.040
Yes.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.040
I can't find moment anywhere.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.040
Well, he's too fat to be most places.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.040
He's coming from under the hat.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.040
Well, here I am, sniff.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.040
Who on earth are you?

18:07.040 --> 18:09.040
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.040
I won, and didn't I?

18:11.040 --> 18:13.040
You looked everywhere in the house,

18:13.040 --> 18:15.040
and you couldn't find me, couldn't you?

18:15.040 --> 18:16.040
So I won.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.040
Who'd want to find you anyway?

18:18.040 --> 18:21.040
Well, you were trying hard enough, weren't you?

18:21.040 --> 18:23.040
What is this, a new game?

18:23.040 --> 18:25.040
My name's Snork Maiden.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.040
What's yours?

18:26.040 --> 18:28.040
I'm the king of Movement Valley.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.040
My pretty one.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.040
You're too ugly to be the king of anything.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.040
Well, now.

18:35.040 --> 18:38.040
That's not a very nice thing to say to your friend.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.040
Is it, Papa?

18:39.040 --> 18:43.040
Now, you'd better tell me what you have done with Movement.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.040
But I'm here.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.040
Where?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.040
Right here.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.040
Who are you?

18:47.040 --> 18:50.040
And where is Movement?

18:54.040 --> 18:55.040
Papa.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.040
I'm certainly not your Papa.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.040
Yes, you are.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.040
Come on.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.040
I'm Movement.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.040
I don't know who you are.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.040
I'm not Movement.

19:03.040 --> 19:06.040
He's nice and handsome and nothing like you.

19:06.040 --> 19:09.040
Have you looked at yourself in a mirror?

19:09.040 --> 19:10.040
Ah!

19:10.040 --> 19:12.040
But where's my nose gone?

19:12.040 --> 19:14.040
Oh, there's nothing there anymore.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.040
Ah!

19:15.040 --> 19:16.040
Ah!

19:16.040 --> 19:17.040
Oh no!

19:17.040 --> 19:18.040
My tail's all pushy!

19:18.040 --> 19:19.040
Ah!

19:19.040 --> 19:20.040
Oh!

19:27.040 --> 19:29.040
This is terrible!

19:30.040 --> 19:31.040
Oh!

19:35.040 --> 19:37.040
Who are you?

19:37.040 --> 19:39.040
What have you done with me?

19:39.040 --> 19:41.040
It must be a nightmare!

19:41.040 --> 19:43.040
I want to come back!

19:43.040 --> 19:46.040
Go away, you're horrible!

19:46.040 --> 19:49.040
Dear me, what's all this noise?

19:49.040 --> 19:51.040
What's happened?

19:51.040 --> 19:53.040
Mama!

19:53.040 --> 19:55.040
Mama!

19:55.040 --> 19:56.040
Mama!

19:56.040 --> 19:58.040
What earth is this?

19:58.040 --> 20:01.040
This is Movement, but just look at him.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.040
You don't look like I'm Movement.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.040
I am, I am.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.040
Please believe me, Mama.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.040
I am Movement.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.040
Well, I don't know.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.040
I'm sure.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.040
Something's happened to me.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.040
Why do I look so different?

20:16.040 --> 20:18.040
Now then calm down.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.040
This won't help at all.

20:19.040 --> 20:21.040
We don't need all this noise.

20:21.040 --> 20:25.040
If you really are Movement, then everything will be alright.

20:25.040 --> 20:28.040
Just give me a minute or two and I'll know.

20:28.040 --> 20:30.040
Mama, call me Movement, please.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.040
I don't know what's happened, but I am me.

20:32.040 --> 20:34.040
Honestly, I am.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.040
Mama, please believe me.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.040
I am Movement.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.040
Let me see.

20:39.040 --> 20:41.040
Oh, Mama, you do know it's me.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.040
You must.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.040
You can forget your little movement.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.040
Please, Mama, please, Mama.

20:46.040 --> 20:49.040
Oh, hush now, hush now.

20:56.040 --> 20:59.040
Mama!

21:02.040 --> 21:06.040
Yes, you're my little movement alright.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.040
Oh, Mama!

21:20.040 --> 21:22.040
Oh.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.040
Oh, Movement.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.040
Papa.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.040
Oh, Movement, my boy.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.040
Where were you hiding?

21:34.040 --> 21:36.040
In there.

21:36.040 --> 21:39.040
In the hat?

21:45.040 --> 21:49.040
Let's hope it's the last we'll see of it.

21:50.040 --> 21:53.040
Movement, Papa, decided that although it was a fine hat,

21:53.040 --> 21:55.040
it was too dangerous to keep.

21:55.040 --> 21:59.040
So, Movement threw it in the river and it floated away.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.040
He wasn't too sure about it though,

22:01.040 --> 22:05.040
because it was a rather special hat.

22:07.040 --> 22:13.040
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:14.040 --> 22:21.040
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:21.040 --> 22:25.040
They're always happy and always at play.

22:25.040 --> 22:28.040
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:28.040 --> 22:32.040
The movements.

22:32.040 --> 22:36.040
The movements.

22:36.040 --> 22:42.040
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:43.040 --> 22:50.040
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:50.040 --> 22:54.040
They're always happy and always at play.

22:54.040 --> 22:58.040
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:58.040 --> 23:01.040
The movements.

23:01.040 --> 23:05.040
The movements.

23:05.040 --> 23:11.040
The movements.

23:13.040 --> 23:17.040
The movements.
