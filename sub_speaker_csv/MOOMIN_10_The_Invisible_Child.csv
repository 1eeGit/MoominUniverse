803160,805160,"Did I say something funny?",802000,804000,"SPEAKER_02"
807160,810160,"Now, that was very mean of Stinky's.",802000,804000,"SPEAKER_02"
810160,813160,"A clever idea, though, of interuser for a van robbery.",807600,812500,"SPEAKER_09"
813160,814160,"Oh, Papa!",812600,813800,"SPEAKER_03"

816160,820160,"and it must have been a nasty shopping trapped in the dark in that cave,",813700,824500,"SPEAKER_09"
820160,823160,"but no real harm came to her, and she didn't disappear,",813700,824500,"SPEAKER_09"
823160,825160,"and her voice got much stronger.",813700,824500,"SPEAKER_09"
825160,826160,"You're so loud!",825000,828700,"SPEAKER_14"

836160,838160,"Good for you, Nanny.",831000,836400,"SPEAKER_14"
838160,840160,"It's surprising the things you can do if you have to,",836700,845400,"SPEAKER_09"
840160,845160,"and you ought to remember that people who speak loudly are usually very noticeable.",836700,845400,"SPEAKER_09"
846160,848160,"Go on, yo! I want to see it!",836700,845400,"SPEAKER_09"
848160,850160,"That's a good idea, Nanny.",846700,848700,"SPEAKER_02"
850160,852160,"If shouting brought back your voice,",848700,850300,"SPEAKER_06"
852160,854160,"you never know it might be just what's needed to make the rest of you.",850500,857600,"SPEAKER_06"
855160,857160,"Try and get angry, as well.",850500,857600,"SPEAKER_06"

860160,862160,"Yeah, and how horrible he is!",857600,864900,"SPEAKER_03"
862160,865160,"That should make you angry. Very angry!",857600,864900,"SPEAKER_03"
868160,870160,"Just your white Stinky!",857600,864900,"SPEAKER_03"

886160,888160,"You can't get away, Stinky.",882500,883800,"SPEAKER_04"
889160,892160,"The forest is my home ground! You won't catch me in here!",888600,888800,"SPEAKER_13"

899160,902160,"Hold it.",895000,895800,"SPEAKER_13"
902160,904160,"You can't do this to me!",895000,895000,"SPEAKER_05"
902160,904160,"You can't do this to me!",895000,895800,"SPEAKER_13"
904160,906160,"We're only doing what you did to Nanny.",895000,895000,"SPEAKER_05"
904160,906160,"We're only doing what you did to Nanny.",895000,895800,"SPEAKER_13"
906160,909160,"Now look, I needed her to help me. I did, I tell ya.",906000,906100,"SPEAKER_05"
909160,912160,"But she didn't want to, huh?",907900,917000,"SPEAKER_03"
912160,915160,"That's why I put her down this hole to change her mind.",907900,917000,"SPEAKER_03"
915160,919160,"And scare her so much that she'd become totally invisible again.",907900,917000,"SPEAKER_03"
919160,923160,"She had to be invisible for my plan. Now get me out of here!",918500,922000,"SPEAKER_13"
923160,926160,"It's all right, Stinky. See you tomorrow!",922000,925900,"SPEAKER_02"
926160,928160,"No! No!",926000,929900,"SPEAKER_13"
936160,939160,"You crushed few things!",933500,933600,"SPEAKER_03"
939160,942160,"I had such a wonderful plan!",937200,939000,"SPEAKER_13"
942160,945160,"Ah, you're spiteful!",939500,941700,"SPEAKER_13"
945160,948160,"Let's hear them my next job!",942200,948200,"SPEAKER_13"
948160,953160,"But despite all that had happened, Nanny's face was still not to be seen.",942200,948200,"SPEAKER_13"
956160,959160,"Then, about ten days later.",949200,953400,"SPEAKER_01"
969160,972160,"This weather seems to push the nails out.",956500,958700,"SPEAKER_01"
974160,977160,"I haven't seen anyone stare at the sea like Nanny does.",972000,972000,"SPEAKER_09"
977160,980160,"Well, maybe she's never seen it before.",974500,977700,"SPEAKER_12"
980160,988160,"Oh, she's crying now!",977800,977800,"SPEAKER_12"

1003160,1005160,"What's the matter?",985300,987400,"SPEAKER_02"
1005160,1008160,"It's the sea! It's far too big!",1005100,1007500,"SPEAKER_14"
1008160,1011160,"You don't have to go on it, you know.",1005100,1007500,"SPEAKER_14"
1013160,1016160,"Mama! Mama! What's up?",1008900,1011000,"SPEAKER_06"
1020160,1022160,"What's the matter with her?",1016100,1016600,"SPEAKER_06"
1022160,1027160,"Nothing to worry about. She's never seen the sea before and she's just surprised at how big it is.",1021600,1026700,"SPEAKER_06"
1030160,1034160,"Well, there's an awful lot of water, that's for sure.",1021600,1026700,"SPEAKER_06"
1039160,1044160,"Nanny's lucky. I wish there was something to surprise or excite me.",1033700,1033700,"SPEAKER_05"
1039160,1044160,"Nanny's lucky. I wish there was something to surprise or excite me.",1033700,1034500,"SPEAKER_06"
1044160,1047160,"Nothing's happened for weeks. Anything would be nice.",1040500,1047700,"SPEAKER_06"
1047160,1049160,"Mama must be bored.",1040500,1047700,"SPEAKER_06"
1049160,1051160,"I think you're right.",1049000,1049000,"SPEAKER_06"

1051160,1052160,"But she never gets bored.",1051100,1058300,"SPEAKER_09"
1052160,1055160,"Well, she is now. She needs something to happen.",1051100,1058300,"SPEAKER_09"
1055160,1058160,"I think we should do something to surprise her.",1051100,1058300,"SPEAKER_09"
1058160,1060160,"Like what?",1051100,1058300,"SPEAKER_09"

1067160,1069160,"What, Papa? Push her into the sea?",1058800,1066200,"SPEAKER_09"
1069160,1072160,"Oh, Papa, you can't. Mama wouldn't like it.",1067200,1071900,"SPEAKER_03"
1072160,1073160,"Just watch me.",1071900,1073000,"SPEAKER_09"
1073160,1076160,"But the water's freezing. A mama will get all wet.",1071900,1073000,"SPEAKER_09"
1076160,1079160,"We never found the water too cold when we were your age.",1073500,1076400,"SPEAKER_03"
1079160,1081160,"You young people today have no sense of fun.",1076400,1080700,"SPEAKER_09"
1081160,1083160,"Did you really used to do things like that?",1081100,1083200,"SPEAKER_03"
