1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Therefore you are your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, what's the problem?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The movement is not a problem. Here with me, here for you on your TV, they are the movements.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They are the movements.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So come with me, give me your hand.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll take you up to a moment land.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You can fly just like a bird.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Sing that song ever.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There were the movements.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There were the movements. There was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la- Bapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapap Snort maiden is running as if the groke is chasing her. I don't think I've ever seen her run so fast.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I wonder what's the matter? Perhaps something terrible has happened. Mom! Mom!

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mom!

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mom!

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Mom!

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Mom!

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Mom!

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Mom!

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Mom!

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Mom!

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Mom!

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Mom!

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Mom!

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Mom!

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Mom!

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Mom!

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Mom!

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Mom!

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Mom!

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Mom!

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Mom!

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Now come down and tell us what's wrong. My brother's on the cliff and he's about to jump off.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What snorke?

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Are you sure?

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He says nothing will prevent him doing it.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, please.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You must stop him, moment.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Did you say that you wanted me to help you with something snorke-made?

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes, I want you to stop snorke jumping off the south side of the cliff.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh dear, I never thought he was the type.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,240
He says it's a test flight.

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,080
Oh.

47
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,400
Now what?

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,240
A test flight, did you say?

49
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,199
Snorke made him.

50
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,280
Do you mean that he's finally finished building

51
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,039
his flying ship?

52
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,639
No, only the blueprint.

53
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,960
At least I think that's all.

54
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,240
He doesn't tell me.

55
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,599
Well, that's a start.

56
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,120
He built a small model of the flying ship's wings,

57
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,240
and they don't look strong enough to carry anyone.

58
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,039
And now he's going to try them out himself

59
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,159
to see if they'll work.

60
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,240
And I know they won't.

61
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,680
They'll break, you know.

62
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,939
Now, wait a minute, Snorkmaden.

63
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:16,560
Slow down and let me think.

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,560
He's made the wings from the blueprint of the flying ship.

65
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,039
Well, his plans are always very accurate.

66
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, Papa, you've got to stop him.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The south side, Papa.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes, I know. The highest and steepest one of all.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, Mum and Papa, there must be something we can do.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes, I'm sure there is. Right.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hurry, everybody. There's no time to lose. Come on.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh, thank you, Mum and Papa. I'm in power!

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No! Go!

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Go!

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Go!

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
A snork? Wait! Wait! Please! Stop! Snork! Don't do it!

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why have you brought everybody here, Snork Maiden?

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
They've come to beg you not to do it!

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You're too young and brilliant for such a tragic end!

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Thank the booble we were in time!

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
As a matter of fact, you weren't.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,040
Oh, really?

83
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,740
It looks very dangerous to me, Snork.

84
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,779
Well, it's not a tall moon in Papa.

85
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,339
I made these wings myself.

86
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,939
They're perfectly balanced.

87
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:54,939
Well, yes, I'm sure they are.

88
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,339
The blueprints are detailed and precise.

89
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,939
They're quite safe.

90
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:01,540
Tell me, Snork.

91
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,379
Why did you stop on the edge like that

92
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:05,000
after running down the slope?

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I was measuring the right length from my approach run.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't do it, Snork. I don't want to lose my only brother.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't make such a fuss, Snork maiden.

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you really think it's safe?

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Of course it is. You don't see birds falling out of the sky, do you?

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, at least do your test flight just above the ground so that if something happens to go wrong, you won't hurt yourself.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I've already done that from the roof of our house and it worked beautifully.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Did you see him?

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No, I didn't see anything.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Of course you didn't. Do you think I let a wimpy little sister watch me?

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What's that supposed to mean, snork?

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,839
Just that I don't want you sticking your big nose into my affairs all the time. I don't like it, and there's nothing to do with you.

105
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,839
Yours is just as big, and I don't want to lose you.

106
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,639
Don't go on about losing me.

107
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,600
Why not?

108
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,279
Come on now, you two.

109
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,879
Stop it.

110
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,519
Hey!

111
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,720
Oops!

112
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,839
That was close.

113
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,879
Snort, Maiden. I don't think your brother is going to be stopped.

114
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,759
Oh, dear, oh dear.

115
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,680
You're very brave, Snort.

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hmm, right. Here we go.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This time it'll be a perfect takeoff.

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's a long way. Oh look, isn't that Snorke in there?

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Where? Where is he? Where is Snorke in?

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You can't see him from there, Snorke. You'll have to come here.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Is it really Snuffkin?

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes, I'm sure it is. Snuffkin!

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah!

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Baby, here you.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No, I don't think so.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
All right, here goes!

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Good luck, Snork! Oh.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He's flying! I... Whoa!

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We're here!

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's the snork! Mark!

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Look at him flying! It's alright, Snorke, Ma maiden. Your brother's doing fine. Come and see.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He's done it! He's done it!

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Whoa, I knew he could do it!

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Will so did I, to be honest.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You, Snark!

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Hello! You, Snark!

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hello!

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Hey, hey, hey!

139
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,500
My baby's test flight is a great success! Yeah! Ha-ha!

140
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,600
Just as I thought he can't fly in wave at the same time!

141
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:43,100
Interesting!

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,399
That was mean stinky. If I could get him to wave with both arms,

143
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,960
he'd probably fall. Look, we don't want you here stinky. Why don't you just go away?

144
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,320
I can find lots to do with that machine. If you won't go away, I will.

145
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:07,559
Well, go on then, Snuffkin. What do I care what you do? Hmm, that would be perfect for robberies.

146
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,360
The wind seems to be taking him out to sea.

147
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,399
Why doesn't he turn around and come back?

148
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,120
Turning in that thing might not be so easy.

149
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
What? Do you mean he can't?

150
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,039
Well, don't worry Snuffkin, I mean, of course he can.

151
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:25,299
Oh, what's this I can't turn on?

152
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,299
Oh!

153
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:29,299
Oh!

154
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:30,299
Oh!

155
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:31,299
Oh!

156
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:32,299
Oh!

157
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:36,299
Oh!

158
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:37,299
Oh!

159
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:39,299
Oh, he's hit a tree.

160
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,299
Come on, hurry!

161
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:40,799
Oh!

162
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,799
Oh!

163
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,799
Oh!

164
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,799
Oh!

165
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,799
Oh!

166
00:09:44,799 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Hurry!

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Is he dead? No, he's been knocked out. He looks dead to me anyway.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Where are they?

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What's happened to the wings?

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
In the tree.

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Ah, he won't want them anymore, so now I can have them.

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Now, let me see. So did the test flight go all right? Will someone tell me what happened? Well, it was fine until the very end.

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm sure that you only need a bit more practice.

174
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Flying isn't the easiest thing to master, you know.

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I expect so. Let's hope you don't run out of bandages, though.

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Excuse me, snork.

177
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Hmm?

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Are you going to use the wings anymore?

179
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I might not. Why?

180
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, well, I'll have them if you don't want them.

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I want to fly in the sky too. It looks the most exciting thing I've ever seen.

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh, please let me have them.

183
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Well, it's not as simple as that moment. They need testing before the design is complete.

184
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:29,679
But I could do that snorkeh. I know I could do it. Please let me have them. Well I suppose I could do with some help. There's a lot to do fetching and

185
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,740
carrying mostly. You haven't said if I can have the wings or not yet snork. Yes you

186
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,759
can but on one condition. Anything. Well now the blueprints are finished and the

187
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,000
wings are more or less right. I'll need somewhere to build the ship and

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
somewhere to store all the materials

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
so they'll be dry and at hand.

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes, you will snorke, I can see that.

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It doesn't have to be much, just a roof will do,

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
or and walls, so that people can't spy on me

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and steal my ideas.

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I can do the building myself,

195
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
but I'll need some help, and when it's finished,

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
you can have the wings.

197
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,700
Great, I'd love to help you. I'd have done that anyway,

198
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,700
but now that I can have the wings, I'll work twice as hard.

199
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,700
You won't regret it, Snorke. I promise you, you won't.

200
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Splendid, woman. That settled them.

201
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,200
Perhaps we can get more help. I'm sure that'd be easy.

202
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,700
How about it, Snorke?

203
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,700
Yes, of course.

204
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,000
Will you help us do Sniff? Yes, but I want something too.

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll let you borrow the wings.

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No, I'm far too heavy. I only break them.

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Don't worry, sniff. I'm sure I'll think of something you can have.

208
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, as long as it's something nice.

209
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, I do love helping people.

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're all heart-sniff. We know always build for posterity.

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Besides, I like pouring cement.

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Okay, Papa. I've given your present a lot of fortune, oh?

213
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And I think I'll give you one of my invaluable books on machinery.

214
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Don't you want it?

215
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, if there was something else, I'm not much of a reader.

216
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What about my invaluable fountain pen? Don't you want it? Well, if there was something else, I'm not much of a reader.

217
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What about my invaluable fountain pen?

218
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Invaluable fountain pen?

219
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What about my invaluable...

220
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Do you have anything that's not invaluable, Snort?

221
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, what about a gold coin?

222
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Well, that sounds great! A real gold coin?

223
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Oh boy, yes, that's a deal.

224
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Oh ho ho!

225
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Uh-oh!

226
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Uh-oh!

227
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Uh-oh!

228
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Uh-oh!

229
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Uh-oh!

230
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Uh-oh!

231
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Uh-oh!

232
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Uh-oh!

233
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Uh-oh!

234
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Uh-oh!

235
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Uh-oh!

236
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! You are digging a very deep hole. Uh...

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You are digging a very deep hole. Why don't you stop and have some sandwiches?

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Should we do that, Papa? Go on.

239
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes, I think we can stop now.

240
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Sniff and your brother in the woods.

241
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:48,600
Yes, I know. I heard them.

242
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,700
Hi, Snork Maiden.

243
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,500
Oh, no.

244
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,799
Wait a minute, I want to ask you something. What is it?

245
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,700
Tell me, Snork Maiden, is it true that your brother gave those wings to a woman?

246
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Yes, it is.

247
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,000
He's helping Snork to build the shadows payment. I thought they'd been broken up. They hit that tree very hard. Well, my brothers are repairing them.

248
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Will you let me pass? I've got to take his lunch to him.

249
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And will he be able to repair them?

250
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He can repair anything!

251
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Mmm.

252
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Gosh! What a lot of wood you've got!

253
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Well, the shed has to be a lot bigger than my life.

254
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. Anything! Mmm!

255
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Gosh! What a lot of wood you've got!

256
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Well, the shed has to be a lot bigger than my flying ship!

257
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Moving and moving proper digging holes, they sure are deep!

258
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Everybody's being very kind, very kind indeed!

259
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Mama's cooking and Snuffkin's gone to get nails.

260
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
There are some other things I need him to get as well.

261
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Will you write them down?

262
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Of course I will, Snork.

263
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh, you're such a planner.

264
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Well, I'm afraid all famous inventors have to be.

265
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yep.

266
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Ah. Ugh.

267
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Whether it was Snork's planning, or the fact that everyone in Mumen Valley helped in some way or other,

268
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:46,000
the hangar or boat house was finished in record time. I'm going to go able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it.

269
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

270
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

271
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

272
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

273
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

274
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

275
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

276
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

277
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

278
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. You? Moments here? Come in, Moments.

279
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Thank you for all your help.

280
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You did so much that these wings are hardly paymented enough.

281
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But if you're happy with them...

282
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh no, it was great fun building this shed.

283
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I changed the design a bit, so it's easier to take off and land.

284
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And turning shouldn't be a problem anymore.

285
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,319
You must remember to give yourself plenty of time though, woman.

286
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,160
Thank you, Snork. I can't wait to try them out.

287
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,440
I'm so excited I don't think I'll sleep tonight.

288
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,319
Are you trying them out tomorrow?

289
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,599
As soon as I can.

290
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,720
You will be careful.

291
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,960
You must practice a lot just above the ground to get used to wearing them before you try

292
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,279
to go too high.

293
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,039
I don't want anything

294
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:57,359
to happen to you. Oh, practice, I promise. Where are you going to practice tomorrow? I haven't decided.

295
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,700
I'll find somewhere when I come out tomorrow. Perhaps on that small hill near the cliff.

296
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
Well that can't be too dangerous.

297
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,000
I'll see you there!

298
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Hey!

299
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Hey!

300
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Hey!

301
00:18:21,000 --> 00:19:00,299
Hey! Rui! Hi, Momen. Where do you put the wings?

302
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:08,000
On the table outside. You must have gone past them if you came in through the veranda door.

303
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
No, I didn't. They're not there.

304
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What?

305
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Oh no, you're right. They're gone.

306
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh dear, I thought it was my friend.

307
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What's happened to them?

308
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Somebody stole them!

309
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What's the matter with you, too?

310
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Is something wrong?

311
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes, somebody stole and Momen's wings!

312
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, perhaps they haven't been stolen.

313
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Of course they have, and I bet I know who did it, too!

314
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Come on!

315
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Where are we going? Do you know where they are?

316
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's stinky! Oh, yeah!

317
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Well, it certainly didn't take you long!

318
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Just a minute, stinky! Those are my wings!

319
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
See? I knew it was him!

320
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Stop your horrible creature! I certainly will, Pat! See? I knew it was him. Oh, stop! Oh, stop! Oh, stop! Oh, stop!

321
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Here, prosthetic!

322
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And the wings are mine!

323
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'll become a master criminal now!

324
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh, all rotten saving!

325
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You shouldn't have left them outside, moment!

326
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, but who'd think let each steal them?

327
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Where his friends, well, almost,

328
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,039
I didn't think even stinky would do something like that! Well, I. Yeah, but who'd think, let each steal them.

329
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,880
Where his friends, well, almost,

330
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,880
I didn't think even stinky would do something like that.

331
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,519
Well, he did, didn't he?

332
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,000
Now, don't worry, moment.
