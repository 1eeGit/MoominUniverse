86580,93780,"seeing things from a completely different point of view we're flying pretty high aren't we",83700,86800,"SPEAKER_09"
93780,104220,"I'm scared we're much too high let's go down please let's go down at once I'm not scared of heights",91800,93900,"SPEAKER_06"
104220,113180,"oh snorke this time you really have succeeded will I could build hundreds of these if you wanted me to",103000,104500,"SPEAKER_01"
113180,123260,"snorke can I steer just for a little while oh thank you do you really know how to steer",110500,113400,"SPEAKER_10"

170540,177140,"steer his flying ship surely not I was talking to snorke while I looked away",167500,171900,"SPEAKER_06"
177140,183380,"suddenly stinky took his place oh and then the thing began tilting hmm but it was just a dream",174900,183800,"SPEAKER_06"
183380,188860,"I don't care I don't like it you shouldn't have dreams like that just for my brother's flying ship is",174900,183800,"SPEAKER_06"
188860,194500,"almost ready dreams often come true you know but it was nothing like the ship your brother's",184100,191800,"SPEAKER_06"
194500,200580,"building it was totally different but tell me what happened to it in the end did it fall down I",192500,207700,"SPEAKER_06"
200580,205780,"don't know I lost sight of it when I fell off and I didn't see it again well surely you could have",192500,207700,"SPEAKER_06"
205780,212660,"turned your head to take a look well I didn't listen moment don't say a word to the snorke",192500,207700,"SPEAKER_06"
212660,219060,"about this he's nervous enough as it is of course not why don't we just forget about it pretend it",210300,220400,"SPEAKER_06"
219060,228660,"never happened oh snorke it's finally completed sure it is but it hasn't been flown yet of course",210300,220400,"SPEAKER_06"
228660,233940,"but it will I want it snorke you don't think there's anything wrong with it of course not but it's",228600,237900,"SPEAKER_06"
233940,242980,"just there's some problem snorke well there might be so what is it fuel fuel but you said you",228600,237900,"SPEAKER_06"
242980,249620,"had developed a new fuel that was really good it's good but you see you see it might not be",242200,245600,"SPEAKER_06"
249620,257140,"powerful enough you mean it might be able to fly no it won't you're quite right or it will",246000,251000,"SPEAKER_10"
257140,263220,"just be an ordinary ship not a flying ship oh that would be nice what can't go up can't possibly",253900,260000,"SPEAKER_10"
264100,269140,"but that's not the point if it won't fly everyone will laugh at me I know they will",264100,269300,"SPEAKER_10"
270500,276900,"I won't laugh I promise maybe not others will but you wouldn't care about that would you",264100,269300,"SPEAKER_10"
276900,282020,"who cares what other people think the thing is I've already told people that the test flight",274700,278700,"SPEAKER_06"
282020,288740,"will be quite soon in public but I'm sure people will be very nice about it even if it doesn't get",279300,284600,"SPEAKER_10"
288740,296420,"off the ground that's hardly what I want moving I'd like to ask you a favor that's why I sent",284800,289700,"SPEAKER_06"
296420,302420,"for you will you help me I'll do anything you ask snorke of course what I would like is for you",295600,305700,"SPEAKER_10"
302420,313060,"moving my friend to be test pilot for me tomorrow you want me to be a pilot",295600,305700,"SPEAKER_10"
333220,342660,"hey stinky stinky oh listen stinky I'm going to steer that ship is that perfectly clear",306100,307900,"SPEAKER_06"
343460,346260,"you're not to touch the wheel I'm the pilot now",339000,342900,"SPEAKER_06"
352820,360660,"what on earth was that a bear wouldn't you find it difficult to steer it oh no it's real easy",343600,346500,"SPEAKER_06"
360660,365700,"but of course I need to practice before the public demonstration is the snorke going to fly",359100,364300,"SPEAKER_06"
365700,371700,"his own ship he'll be there but he has to stay down in the engine room snuff can I wonder if",364500,364500,"SPEAKER_06"

371700,380420,"this ship will really fly the only problem is the fuel only the fuel you say that's a big problem",371200,373700,"SPEAKER_07"
380420,388260,"I suppose so listen woman suppose now the snorke's flying ship really gets off the ground well of",378900,388100,"SPEAKER_07"
388260,392740,"course it's going to papa that something could happen something could break or you could fall",388100,388500,"SPEAKER_06"
392740,400100,"into an air pocket it's such a dangerous undertaking think moment papa now listen it's not natural",390000,396900,"SPEAKER_07"

412900,421380,"are don't you papa of course I do they come down from the sky like this exactly but of course",411800,414000,"SPEAKER_06"
421380,428660,"we won't need a parachute because nothing will go wrong and I will be the first flying ship pilot ever",419900,423000,"SPEAKER_06"
430020,440580,"oh hi there hello my young man hello how do you do how do you do everybody hello sir I wonder if",425500,429500,"SPEAKER_06"

453780,460260,"supposed to be very secret the information must have leaked out somehow oh well all inventors know",451800,459000,"SPEAKER_07"

694820,700420,"so this is the powerful fuel you've developed is it mr muffle yes it is not as original as",688100,691600,"SPEAKER_07"
700420,707380,"my other inventions I admit but very useful yes useful I call it super fuel only trouble is my",698000,709800,"SPEAKER_09"
707380,713540,"engine has been designed for liquid fuel no problem at all young man if you dissolve this",698000,709800,"SPEAKER_09"
713540,720740,"block of fuel in 10 liters of water your engine will run for at least 10 hours for 10 whole hours",710600,720400,"SPEAKER_09"
720740,725780,"that's incredible if you doubt the word of the muffle then try it out and see for yourself",720500,720600,"SPEAKER_10"
725780,732660,"right now right now better still I guarantee that if used as it is in a solid state your engine",722100,726800,"SPEAKER_09"
732660,739300,"will run not for 10 but for 100 hours 100 hours but that's incredible you really must be some",728200,735700,"SPEAKER_09"
739300,747380,"inventor indeed if what you say is true it would solve the last problem of my flying ship oh now",735700,744700,"SPEAKER_10"
747380,753700,"that I've looked more closely at the padlock this store isn't locked no it isn't so if one",747300,751800,"SPEAKER_07"

759460,766500,"why don't you tell us I don't want snorke falling for one of the muffles crazy ideas that's why",758300,759500,"SPEAKER_07"
766500,771940,"well we'll find out pretty soon maybe you don't realize it but the snorke is pretty clever you know",761100,768400,"SPEAKER_07"
773140,777140,"I think I know exactly what they're doing in there yeah what",768700,772300,"SPEAKER_06"
779540,784420,"I saw that man pouring something into the flying ship what was it well I guess it must have",776300,777500,"SPEAKER_07"
784420,789620,"been fuel movement how come you saw him there's a crack that's just about wide enough for me",779600,785600,"SPEAKER_01"
789620,795860,"but I won't tell you where what are those two in there talking about oh yeah so this is the great",787300,791300,"SPEAKER_01"

802180,809060,"fair you are solid fuel indeed huh a hundred hours you're an imposter sir oh it isn't true if",799900,802000,"SPEAKER_02"

822340,827540,"maybe we shouldn't have dissolved it in the water that was a mistake imposter but I'm the",817000,821500,"SPEAKER_09"
827540,833140,"mother I don't care maybe it's just a misunderstanding and the fuel isn't suited for flying ships",822400,828400,"SPEAKER_09"
833140,838500,"wrong it suits everything forget the fuel that was just a trick so he could come here and get",827900,840300,"SPEAKER_07"
838500,845620,"to see my flying ship so the muffler has come here to spy mean ridiculous I don't steal",827900,840300,"SPEAKER_07"
845620,854660,"papa was there anything you wanted to see me about huh no I just dropped by no cause for excitement",840600,848000,"SPEAKER_07"
854660,859780,"the fuels are done no it's not that's not true I don't invent guns what would be the point of",853000,858000,"SPEAKER_07"
859780,865460,"inventing them oh listen to me please let's try and use the fuel once more small thanks once",858000,860700,"SPEAKER_09"
865460,870100,"was once too many I'll have to clean my tanks from your gunge get out of my sight",863000,870300,"SPEAKER_10"

884900,899620,"now listen stinky I'm doing this for the snorke say isn't that so I don't care",880900,886600,"SPEAKER_06"
899620,903940,"you're doing it for all I want is to get a good look at the famous flying ship you'd need",899200,903500,"SPEAKER_03"
903940,908740,"something very powerful to get a thing like that off the ground something so powerful that only",903500,922900,"SPEAKER_09"
908740,913540,"I the muffler could ever have invented it remind me one day to show you my famous triangular",903500,922900,"SPEAKER_09"
913540,919780,"handkerchief now all we have to do is not dissolve the fuel in water but use the solid fuel hurry",903500,922900,"SPEAKER_09"
919780,926100,"up with that lock sticky or maybe I should invent a lock pick come on stinky hurry hurry",903500,922900,"SPEAKER_09"

958580,965780,"this is it just a drop of water on the fuel block now that should do it can I start it now",956100,959300,"SPEAKER_09"
966340,968100,"not yet all right",964500,967400,"SPEAKER_09"
