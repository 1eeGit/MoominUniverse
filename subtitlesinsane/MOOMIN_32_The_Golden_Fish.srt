1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I think it's a good idea.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,879
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. Yeah, with me, they're for you on your TV. They are the movements.

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,839
They are the movements.

11
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,079
So come with me, give me your hand.

12
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,159
I'll take you up to a moment land.

13
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,920
You can fly just like a bird.

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,359
Sing that song ever.

15
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,280
There were the movements.

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,000
There were the movement, there was the movement,

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There was the movement, there was the movement,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There was the movement, there was the movement, When the Hennon first told Moomin about the golden fish, to himself that it must look something like this.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
My grandpa told me that his mother had actually seen it. So you never saw it yourself, Mr. Hamlin?

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
No, I'm a batonist.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It comes to the surface only under very special conditions.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's very rarely seen.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,840
Conditions? Yes. First of all, it must be right between summer and autumn.

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,640
But that's now. Yes. It has to be in the afternoon sunshine after heavy rain.

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,159
Oh, yes, that does narrow it down. And there must be no wind. Grandpa said not even a ripple on the water.

26
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,680
Oh dear. And there are some other conditions that he really didn't

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:14,120
know about anyway to see it. You must be extremely lucky. Hmm. Just getting to the lake itself

28
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:22,560
isn't too easy. It's way beyond lonely mountains. Going over lonely mountains and back would

29
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,599
take at least two days. Not really, because I know a shortcut movement.

30
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:29,080
I could take you there and back in one day.

31
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,639
Oh, could you do that?

32
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,520
Yes.

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,280
Have you already been there, Snuffkin?

34
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,599
Just once.

35
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,680
Oh, will you show me the way?

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,080
You really want to go?

37
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,879
Yes.

38
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,280
I must see that golden fish with my own eyes and maybe capture it.

39
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,039
It won't be easy to capture.

40
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,400
Why not?

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,199
From what I've heard, the golden fish is far too clever to get caught.

42
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,919
I know, but it would be so much fun.

43
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,039
You going alone?

44
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,960
Well, Snorkmaiden said she wanted to come along.

45
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,719
She gets these ideas, you know.

46
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,759
Just Snorkmaiden?

47
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,120
Uh, maybe a little my.

48
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,159
What about Sniff?

49
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,000
I think he wants to come along too.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,199
For both you. In that case, we'd better go across the mountains. Why's that? Why can't we take the shortcut?

51
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,800
The path is rather steep and dangerous, you know, Moomin. Especially in the forest of witches.

52
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:27,000
I know witches? Not now, maybe. Oh, so it's safe then. But it's a very deep forest, dark and scary even in daytime.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's okay, we'll Don't go. Shh.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Shh.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Shh.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Shh.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Shh.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Shh.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Shh.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Shh.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Shh.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Shh.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Shh.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,599
Shh. Shh. Shh. Oh dear!

65
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:29,279
Good morning, Snuffkin! Sorry, Snuffkin, guess I overslept.

66
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,480
Snort Maiden a little my aunt here yet.

67
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,480
You're very early.

68
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,040
Hmm, I dreamt I caught the golden fish, and then of course I couldn't go back to sleep.

69
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,480
Well, let's go.

70
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,079
Shouldn't we wait for Snort Maiden a little my?

71
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,800
Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?

72
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,000
And anyway, didn't we decide that we wouldn't wait for anybody? Wait for snork maiden and little Mai? Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,839
And anyway, didn't we decide that we wouldn't wait for anybody?

74
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,399
So it might be better this way.

75
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,399
What's better this way, woman?

76
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,680
Oh, little Mai.

77
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,959
Why don't you stay here?

78
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,800
This will be a very tough expedition.

79
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm tougher than you.

80
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:08,000
Wait for me!

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Hey, you walk any faster, Snapp? I'm still so sleepy!

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Why did we have to leave so early, Moomin?

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
To get there back in a day, Snorkemaid.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But we aren't taking the shortcut, are we?

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes, but it still might get dark before we're back.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,540
I won't be able to walk back this fast, you know,

87
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,939
because my bucket will be full of water for the golden fish.

88
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:32,639
Well, don't be disappointed if you don't catch it.

89
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,699
But that's my whole reason for going.

90
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,339
But you heard what the Himmielin said, Sniff?

91
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:38,980
We'll be extremely lucky to even catch

92
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,740
side of the golden fish.

93
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,379
I heard him, and now's exactly the right time.

94
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,000
Maybe the others made too much noise.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We'll just have to wait and see.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't you worry, I'll catch you, alright?

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Where are they?

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We're going sorely in the morning.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,899
How far is the forest of witches? Where are they? We're going sorely in the morning.

100
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:11,639
How far is the forest of witches? I'd say about two hours.

101
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,779
And can you also tell us how long from one end of the forest

102
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,639
to the other's naufkin?

103
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,839
About the same.

104
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,040
Uh, eh.

105
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Eh, eh.

106
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,519
Are there really such things as witches?

107
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,180
No.

108
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,100
Baby, because I'm not a bit scared of them.

109
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,300
Aren't you?

110
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,800
Not the least little bit.

111
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,199
There used to be some, though.

112
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,199
What witch is?

113
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,199
Well, of course, sniff.

114
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,300
What else do you think that they call it the forest of witches, huh?

115
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,800
And you're absolutely sure that there are no witches now.

116
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I haven't heard of any coming back.

117
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Mm-hmm.

118
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,000
So you're not absolutely sure that there are no wedges.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Where's Moomey and her still in bed?

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He was off before you woke up, Papa.

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hmm.

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, the golden fish.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Good morning, dear.

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I wanted to go with them.

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But you're writing your memoirs you're far too busy.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And that's very true, with the thought of the fish that no one has seen.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That might have been a whole chapter.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Do you think they'll catch it?

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No, I doubt it very much. It's highly unlikely.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
In that case, you should have gone with them.

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No, I do know a thing or two about fishing.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Snuffkin does too, but he's still so young.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure Snuffkin will manage.

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, this is a spooky forest.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Maybe the witch is every time.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Stop it, little mime!

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Listen, everybody, don't stray away from me.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Promise, you might get lost. Oh, it's so dark in here.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Sure, Razz, and so thick the sun can't get through.

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's because of those clouds.

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I can hear the wind, but we need calm. That's because of those clouds.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I can hear the wind! But we need calm.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes, but we also need heavy rain.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're right. That's what the Hemiellin said.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It sure looks like rain.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Not only looks like...

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:57,600
Oh, it's raining!

148
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,279
Here. Oh, thank you.

149
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,000
My God, I say this rainstorm was very sudden. Don't worry, it won't last that long.

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
How do you know that?

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Vagabons do.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This rain isn't that heavy.

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No, it's not bad, but we better hurryer.

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We won't get to the lake till noon, and that'll be too late.

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't think we'll get very wet down here, Mum.

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So why don't we move on?

157
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You're so excited.

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,960
What should we do? It's nothing so why don't we move on? You're so excited.

159
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,679
What should we do, it's nothing.

160
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,440
Well, we could move on, couldn't we?

161
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:45,000
Yet! We really are getting too early. We better find some shelter quickly.

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
About where can we shelter?

163
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There's nothing in this wood-exec tree.

164
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
On your tree, then, again.

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah!

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What is it, Snorke, Nathan?

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There's a house over there.

168
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's fallen to wreck and ruin. Well, at least it'll keep the rain off. Hello there.

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Anyone home?

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There's lived here for a long time. I wonder who could have been lived here all alone.

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Huh?

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I know who it was.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And so do we all.

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't we?

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's your lady.

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't we? I know who it was, and so do we all.

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He sure is, don't mean.

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The witches, of course.

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Look around for dried spices, magic herbs,

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
brown sticks, and a black cat, a niren pot, a pile.

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But now, cruel!

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,200
No, the witch rode away on it.

183
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,600
Oh!

184
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,399
There's someone here.

185
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,399
Who is it?

186
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,399
Let's get out of here.

187
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:50,000
Can't come over there.

188
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No, don't. That's okay, Snuffkin. We gotta get out of this place.

189
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Hmm.

190
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I can't move, Snuffkin. Stinky? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm so proud of Snip the faint when he hears my voice. Where are you after anyway?

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, come on, tell me. Can't you even take a joke? Come on, wait for me.

192
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That way. Okay. Come on. Okay.

193
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Come on.

194
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Come on.

195
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Come on.

196
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Come on.

197
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Come on.

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Come on.

199
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Come on.

200
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Come on.

201
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Come on. Come on. This is it, isn't it? Yes it is. Where's the golden fish? I really don't know.

202
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I've never seen it either.

203
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I've never seen it either.

204
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I've never seen it either.

205
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I've never seen it either.

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I've never seen it either.

207
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I've never seen it either.

208
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I've never seen it either.

209
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I've never seen it either.

210
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I've never seen it either.

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I've never seen it either. I've never seen it either. I've never seen it either. I it? Yes it is. Where's the golden fish? I really don't know.

212
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I've never seen it either.

213
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
With rain, sunshine and calm,

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sure the fish will come.

215
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The golden fish?

216
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Help me catch it!

217
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I just gotta have that golden fish!

218
00:13:35,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Now! Oh! I can't see any fish anywhere. Maybe it was Hemiellin's idea of a very funny joke.

219
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The Hemiellin doesn't joke. Let's sit down and wait.

220
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm sure the golden fish will appear for us.

221
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't believe it. Do me the say you came all this way here just to see some stupid old fish.

222
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I came to catch it.

223
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, that's even more stupid.

224
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hey, stop making those ripples.

225
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,360
Uh, I'm going to say you came all this way here just to see some stupid old fish. I came to catch it.

226
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,600
Well, that's even more stupid.

227
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Hey, stop making those ripples.

228
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Eh.

229
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:37,799
So they really got excited and walked all the way, you say?

230
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,799
Oh, to be young again.

231
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,080
Well, I would have gone with them if I hadn't over slept.

232
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,000
I didn't know that you were that young woman, Papa.

233
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh, I'm not exactly old, you know.

234
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Pretty interesting to see a fish that hardly anyone's ever seen.

235
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Snipset that he would catch this golden fish

236
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
if it's the last thing he did.

237
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh, how?

238
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, he had a net and a very large bucket to carry at home, then.

239
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:27,759
That's a good one. What do you mean? and a very large bucket to carry at home, then. Hmm, can't see it from up here. Hmm, oh, the hemulin was certainly right.

240
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,120
Hardly anyone has seen this golden fish

241
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,799
and we're not gonna see it either.

242
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,919
Maybe somebody ate a mure's ago.

243
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,919
Stinky be quiet, please.

244
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,419
Oh!

245
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:38,659
Huh!

246
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:39,919
Did you see it?

247
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,919
Where did you see it?

248
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,419
Huh!

249
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:49,919
I saw a fish jump, but I couldn't tell if it was golden. It was much too far away.

250
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,000
With the sun over there we just see the outlines, Nork Maiden.

251
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes, we couldn't really see the color. Look everybody, look! I can see a raft over there!

252
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Hey, let's take it and go out to the middle of the lake.

253
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But it's much too small for all of us.

254
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Don't worry, Sniff, this won't sink.

255
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm staying.

256
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You do what you like, but you'll never catch any fish

257
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
if you're afraid of water.

258
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Stinky, you can help me. It's gold, you know.

259
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We can sell it for a lot of money

260
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,240
and then we'll both be very wealthy.

261
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,879
I think it was somewhere around here, wasn't it?

262
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:43,480
Or, alas, I suppose, hard to say.

263
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, I can't see anything.

264
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I can't see!

265
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
There's certainly no sign of it now.

266
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Well, we'll just have to sit and wait here.

267
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
We have no choice.

268
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And I'm not going home until I've seen it.

269
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm happy to wait all day.

270
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You won't find it by looking up at the sky.

271
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You know what?

272
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Fish like it in places where there are lots of wings.

273
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Oh, the rafts in the middle of the lake.

274
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
They just want to see the fish, but you wait. I'm going to catch it.

275
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Maybe somebody's already caught it and you can get it in a tin.

276
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Huh?

277
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Huh?

278
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What? Did you see that?

279
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Over there! Something shiny jumping!

280
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
What did you see? That's all it did! Now keep quiet!

281
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,200
I hate fishing. Guess we better think about getting back otherwise we'll never get home before nightfall.

282
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,880
I don't want to get lost on a raft in the dark on this lonely lake.

283
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,480
Perhaps we were expecting too much.

284
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,799
Maybe your right's not made in, but I really thought we'd see it.

285
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,400
This is the most disappointing day of my life.

286
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,000
We can come back.

287
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,599
Yes.

288
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:28,000
It's not gonna stop.

289
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Hang on. Did you see a moment? Shh. Oh.

290
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's gigantic. I'm not going to die. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh it! First, it was I believe about it! So great!

291
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Thank you, man!

292
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, that was great!

293
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I really saw it!

294
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I saw it!

295
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
First, it was I believe about it!

296
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So great!

297
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Thank you, man!

298
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, that was great!

299
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, that was great!

300
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Oh, that was great!

301
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I really saw it! I saw it! First, it was I believe about it! Oh!

302
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Got it! Got it!

303
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Got it!

304
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Hey, I'm home in!

305
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I did it! I caught it!

306
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
God, what?

307
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Why the golden fish and horse?

308
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What?

309
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I've got the golden fish in here if you want to have a look at it.

310
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
See, it's in this bucket.

311
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You don't really believe that is the golden fish.

312
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's just another stupid fish. I can swear that it really was golden when I caught it.

313
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It must have been the sun making it land in the water.

314
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It was you said it was the golden fish.

315
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,220
Why don't you let it go?

316
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,960
You know it's not the right one, and he hates it in that bucket.

317
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Huh?

318
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,640
Hmm...

319
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,400
There he goes.

320
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,039
It looks so happy now.

321
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:01,240
It really was gold when I first saw it.

322
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,440
We believe you, Sniff.

323
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:16,480
Now let's go home.

324
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,240
Steph and Stinky never really got over their belief that it was actually the golden fish they had caught.

325
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,039
But moving in the others were in no doubt about what they had seen.

326
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:47,000
They and the emulators were great friends. We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

327
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
They're always happy and goes at play

328
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The moments are having fun day after day

329
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The movements, the movements, the movements The Moons.
