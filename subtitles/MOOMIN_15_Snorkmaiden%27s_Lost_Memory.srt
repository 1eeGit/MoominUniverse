1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come. Come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you are your TV. They are the movements. They are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So come with me. Give me your hand. I'll take you up to a movement land.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You can fly just like a bird. Sing that song ever. There were the movements.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There were the movements. There were the movements. There were the movements.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There were the movements. There were the movements.

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:48,000
For a whole week, snorkemaiden had been curled up on the sofa, reading fairy tales.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's a lovely day and at last, movement is persuaded to come out for a walk in the lonely mountains.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, it's beautiful up here. Aren't you glad you came now? This is much better than fairy tales, isn't it snorkemaiden?

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, look, movement. It's Adelvice. No, it isn't. That doesn't grow here at all.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sure it is. I know what it looks like. I'm sorry, but it's not.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, it's just like in Heidi. No, it's not. It's just a daisy. Oh, come on. I want to pick it.

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh, no, it's too dangerous. I know then. You can do it. You're my boyfriend, aren't you, movement?

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, I suppose we could climb down there, but I promise you it's not Adelvice. That only grows in the Alps and there are hundreds of miles away.

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I know it's Adelvice. Be careful. They don't care about danger in fairy tales. That's why they call them fairy tales, silly.

16
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Fairy Princess, please accept this, my humble offering.

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Thank you, Brave Knight. You are right, movement. This isn't Adelvice. See, I told you...

18
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's gonna be hard to get down from here, you know? Can't we go back the way we came?

19
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, I think it'll be easier to try to get to that path. If you say so...

20
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's nearer anyway, and better than going up. I'm surprised you're such a good climber.

21
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, Royalty is good at practically everything.

22
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's not made of. It's not made of.

23
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's not made of.

24
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let me see six petals. What was that, a giant snowball? It can't be, it isn't winter.

25
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, nothing of interest to me. Now, where was I?

26
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We start hemulating. Has Snorkmaiden just gone past you?

27
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Snorkmaiden, no, I've seen going past. It's a very large snowball.

28
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That was Snorkmaiden.

29
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But she's not made of snow?

30
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Stop! Snorkmaiden, stop!

31
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Snorkmaiden, snorkmaiden!

32
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, I'll praise the boobah. She's still breathing. She's just knocked herself out.

33
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, Mum and what's happened to her?

34
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
She's unconscious.

35
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What are you trying to do?

36
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I want to get her home to Mama.

37
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, difficult. She should lose a bit of weight.

38
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Perhaps she'd come around if we splashed cold water on her face.

39
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, there's nothing to fetch it in.

40
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Ah, if you cut some bark off a tree trunk, you could make a small container.

41
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What a good idea. If you stay here, I'll go and do that.

42
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Wake up, Snorkmaiden.

43
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, that's cold.

44
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Has she come around yet, Mr. Hemulet?

45
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No.

46
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay.

47
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, good. It's working.

48
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
How are you feeling, Snorkmaiden?

49
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Are you all right, Snorkmaiden?

50
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh, where am I?

51
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We're still up in Lonely Mountains.

52
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Who am I?

53
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Why Royal Highness the Princess of Lonely Mountains?

54
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What? A Princess?

55
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, yes, of course.

56
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And who are you?

57
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I am the Prince of Lonely Mountains.

58
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, yeah.

59
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh, yeah.

60
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
With that ridiculous shape?

61
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
No, a gesture, perhaps.

62
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You want?

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You there. Do not laugh.

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I think the poor girl must have lost her memory.

65
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Of course not. She's just pretending.

66
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
When does not whisper with royalty present, do you hear?

67
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So sorry, Royal Highness.

68
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
A poor crafters cabin.

69
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is your castle, ma'am.

70
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Royalty doesn't live in shacks.

71
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Snorkmaiden, stop calling us that.

72
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's very rude.

73
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, forgive me.

74
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
A royal castle is elsewhere.

75
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Is it not?

76
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What?

77
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That must be hunting lodge.

78
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No, of course, that's what it is.

79
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Good, we accept that.

80
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Are you two going to tell me what you're so busy looking at?

81
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Send a maid to my room, my good man.

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
A maid?

83
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
My good man.

84
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Papa, have you seen Snorkmaiden?

85
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes, up there.

86
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Mama, please would you go on have a word with Snorkmaiden?

87
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Have you been quarreling?

88
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh, no.

89
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's just that she fell and banged her head.

90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And now she thinks she's a royal princess.

91
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What?

92
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Ah, Nanette, come here, please.

93
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Nanette?

94
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm Boomin, Mama.

95
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, we're too weary for your foolish jokes, girl.

96
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh, we are very tired indeed, Nanette.

97
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Please bring our silk nighty with the hand embroidered swans and clowns.

98
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Then you may go.

99
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I wish you, Mama.

100
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
All right, I'm sure.

101
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But she seems convinced she's a princess.

102
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Sounds as if it's dangerous, doesn't it, Mama?

103
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, I don't think so.

104
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I was only joking when I called her a princess.

105
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm very glad you didn't call her an opera singer.

106
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Is Snorkmaiden asleep now?

107
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, yes, in a night gown with crowns and swans embroidered on it.

108
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And another thing, Boomin, she wants a canopy put up immediately.

109
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What's that?

110
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, a fancy cover over the bed that's draped in silks, envelopes, and tassels.

111
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh, she was very upset because there wasn't one there already.

112
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It might be necessary.

113
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Her memory could have come back by the time she wakes up.

114
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Why don't we wait and see?

115
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
She might be fine after a rest.

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I sure hope so.

117
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But what do we do if it hasn't come back?

118
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Let's think about that if it happens.

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We might not have to build that canopy.

120
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let me try it.

121
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Try what?

122
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
To get Snorkmaiden's memory back, what else?

123
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, how?

124
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Well, I think that if she sees me, she'll remember me

125
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and then she'll remember everything else too.

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Don't be silly little Mai.

127
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If she doesn't remember me, why should you remember you, eh?

128
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Simple, because I'm unforgettable.

129
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
There is that, I suppose.

130
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
She's still fast asleep.

131
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Well, I'm glad we made the canopy anyway.

132
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It looks really great, doesn't it?

133
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh, oh, look.

134
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
She's opening her eyes.

135
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Are you awake?

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Get up, Snorkmaiden.

137
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Come on.

138
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Let's go down to the beach.

139
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And who is that person?

140
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Come on.

141
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You remember me.

142
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I warn you if you know you'll be sorry.

143
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, quite amusing.

144
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Ah, so you remember me now.

145
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Of course we do.

146
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
There you are, I told you.

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Who am I then?

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, you're another court jester.

149
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Of course.

150
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Ah, don't be little Mai.

151
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
A court jester.

152
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh, very funny.

153
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
She's a better clown than the other one.

154
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You can perform it our wedding.

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You are a wedding.

156
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm stinky.

157
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What are you doing here?

158
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,500
I'm stinky.

159
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,000
What are you doing here?

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Moment asked me to come over to Moment House and propose to some princess.

161
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Moments lost his marbles as well then.

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I think he wanted stinky as a contrast.

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You what?

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You mean to tell me you're both my rivals for the hands of the royal princess?

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, it's not very original.

166
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But in order to win the princess and have her kingdom stinky, you'll need to saw three riddles.

167
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Hey, that's great! What's this kingdom like?

168
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
All right, sooner number one, you may now enter.

169
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, that's me.

170
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, hi, princess. How are you doing?

171
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Jester, is this man a suitor?

172
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
He is.

173
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I fear he does not treat us with respect.

174
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Forgive him, your highness.

175
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He is from a foreign land and does not know the ways of your kingdom.

176
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, all right, very well.

177
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Here is the first riddle. Are you ready?

178
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Fire away!

179
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Now then, listen, what is it that is yellow, has four legs and sings?

180
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, dear. And unusual, canary?

181
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
With four legs, you nincomboop.

182
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't know any birds with four legs, but I do.

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't know.

184
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't know.

185
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't know.

186
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't know.

187
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I don't know.

188
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't know.

189
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't know.

190
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
With four legs, you nincomboop.

191
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't know any birds with four legs.

192
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Who said it was a bird?

193
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
All right, then, what's the answer, snark baby?

194
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He shows no respect.

195
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Throw him into a dungeon and give him no food.

196
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Your highness, he is temporarily out of his mind after the long journey here.

197
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Hang on, I'm not out of my mind.

198
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
How do I pee?

199
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
How for what's the answer? That's what I want to know.

200
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Silence, it does not concern you.

201
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We believe you to be of lowly birth.

202
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Sorry about this, napkin.

203
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Don't worry.

204
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Hmm, no, sir Gellad, but not bad.

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I am honored to be here, your royal highness.

206
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He'll do.

207
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
An easy riddle to start.

208
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Here it is.

209
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
First, what is the number of which we think?

210
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Take your time.

211
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Two.

212
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
For a faux-gallant night, that is correct.

213
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Now listen, what is the word upon our mind?

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Love.

215
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's amazing.

216
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Truly, the suitor has brains as well as looks.

217
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Question three.

218
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There are two numbers on our mind.

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What do they add up to?

220
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Answer carefully for it.

221
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Could unlock your princess's heart.

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
21.

223
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Oh, was that right, too?

224
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh no, it was 22.

225
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
My heart is heavy.

226
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
For chance we should have said it was correct.

227
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
He was rather cute.

228
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Was he not just her?

229
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's your turn now, stinky.

230
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, I suppose that even half of Snortiles would be something.

231
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Think she'll ever get her memory back?

232
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Of course she will.

233
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This is not our idea of a suitor.

234
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
His heart is aching for you, your royal highness.

235
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Ah, let it ache.

236
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh, all right.

237
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll give him a chance.

238
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Here is a question number one.

239
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What is the number we are thinking of?

240
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Well of all our stupid questions.

241
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We haven't all day.

242
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh, well of...

243
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Four.

244
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Indeed not.

245
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It is 3,598,765.

246
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Begone out.

247
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Hey, Snortiles, that's up there.

248
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's not fair right there, ma'am.

249
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Go home.

250
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Give me another one I want after.

251
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh, what a rude suitor.

252
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
We are no longer in the mood for royal marriage, Jester.

253
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
At least not today.

254
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
A wise decision.

255
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
A princess of the lonely mountains.

256
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
They will be prostrate with grief,

257
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
but bid the other suitors to go home.

258
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Do not let them beg.

259
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We would not like that.

260
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Very well, your royal highness.

261
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Do it kindly.

262
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We wish them no pain at all.

263
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
From this day on, we shall devote ourselves to good works

264
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and to the well-being of our people.

265
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh.

266
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You, I didn't want to marry you anyway.

267
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Wonder what Snort maintenance up to now?

268
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Upstairs thinking.

269
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
She says she'll devote her life to good works.

270
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Works, what works?

271
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't know, but she probably wants to be remembered

272
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
in the history books.

273
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The princess who was adored by her subjects.

274
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh, she's coming down.

275
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Your royal highness, may I assist you?

276
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Send the net to us.

277
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
She is on an errand, your highness.

278
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Then have someone else make soup,

279
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
nourishing but not too rich.

280
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Soup, highness?

281
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes indeed.

282
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And then we shall take it to our poor subjects ourselves.

283
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What kind of soup?

284
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
We don't know.

285
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
We eat. We don't cook.

286
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The poor will be happy with anything

287
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
brought by the princess herself.

288
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Now hurry man, be quick about it.

289
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Now she wants some soup.

290
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
This will be ample.

291
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The poor do not eat much.

292
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It would only make the meal.

293
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't know anyone poor around here, your majesty.

294
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Nonsense.

295
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Do what, do what.

296
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Greetings jester.

297
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What now?

298
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
We're taking soup to the poor.

299
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Made with our own regal fingers.

300
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Do you know where they are jester?

301
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Your fingers?

302
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh, I know.

303
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Good, wonderful.

304
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Take us to them now.

305
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
They will be so grateful.

306
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You back princess.

307
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That house there.

308
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh yes.

309
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's nice to know that the poor and my kingdom are so well off.

310
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Oh you, please come over here.

311
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Hmm?

312
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Who are you?

313
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm the princess of Lonely Mountain.

314
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Princess?

315
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh!

316
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What moment you're all highness?

317
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Do not keep us waiting.

318
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We have a lot to do.

319
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm coming.

320
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm coming.

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Forgive me you're all highness.

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I had no idea you were.

323
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
My mind smart maiden.

324
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That common name again, we are princess.

325
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Little sticks.

326
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You're not right in the head coming here bothering your elders

327
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and betters like this.

328
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Others?

329
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Oh!

330
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Are you the queen men?

331
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Hmm?

332
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I am Mrs. Philly jog.

333
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Now what do you want?

334
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You're just fulfilling our royal duty bringing soup to the poor.

335
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Giving cheer to those less fortunate that ourselves.

336
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Here my good woman.

337
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Now if you just pour.

338
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh, there you call me poor.

339
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You who doesn't have a stitch of clothing to your name.

340
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh, the rich aroma of the soup must have overcome you Mrs. Philly jog.

341
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Ah!

342
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Eat it yourself your majesty.

343
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh!

344
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
This is how I treason.

345
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Send for the guard.

346
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Take her to the tower.

347
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Oh!

348
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh!

349
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We cannot see.

350
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm afraid that serves you right, Snork maiden.

351
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Snork maiden!

352
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Don't use that common name.

353
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Help us.

354
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We cannot see.

355
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Please don't steal.

356
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Your royal highness.

357
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh, hold a moment.

358
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, oh, oh.

359
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I think it's stuck moment.

360
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Use the hand.

361
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Ah!

362
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Stop!

363
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You heard it right.

364
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'll get it on.

365
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Out of the way.

366
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Ah, wait a minute.

367
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You can't break that soup, Turin.

368
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's a family heirloom.

369
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And you mustn't hit Snork maiden on the head.

370
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You might hurt her.

371
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Stop fooling around and get this thing off, will you?

372
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
All right.

373
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh, poor smart maiden.

374
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You didn't have to get up that hard.

375
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Difficult to judge it with a broom.

376
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I've never hit anyone wearing a soup, Turin, before.

377
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Oh, you will write your royal highness.

378
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Oh, forgive us, your royal highness.

379
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Sprinkle some cold water over her face.

380
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
No, she'd hate that, mama.

381
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Snork maiden.

382
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Ah, it's no good, woman.

383
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't think she'll wake up today.

384
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm going to be late.

385
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm going to be late.

386
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm going to be late.

387
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm going to be late.

388
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm going to be late.

389
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm going to be late.

390
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm going to be late.

391
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm going to be late.

392
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm going to be late.

393
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Oh, good, woman.

394
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't think she'll wake up to anything, but your royal highness.

395
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Your highness.

396
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Your highness.

397
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Hang on.

398
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Snork maiden.

399
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, I'm so glad your royal highness is with us again.

400
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I hope your royal highness is not badly hurt.

401
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Where am I?

402
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
In moment, Valley, of course, stupid.

403
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Where do you think?

404
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
That's weird.

405
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I thought, woman, and I had gone for a walk in the lonely mountains.

406
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Didn't we, woman?

407
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Huh?

408
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Do you remember who I am, Snork maiden?

409
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Woman, what are you talking about?

410
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Of course I do.

411
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And you don't think you're a princess anymore?

412
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Princess?

413
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Have you gone crazy or something?

414
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What princess?

415
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What do you mean, woman?

416
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Hooray!

417
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
She's back to normal.

418
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Snork maiden's back to normal.

419
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes, it's nice to have you back again.

420
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Yes, it's wonderful.

421
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Welcome home.

422
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What is?

423
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What's wonderful?

424
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Have you all gone loopy or something?

425
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Never mind, Snork maiden.

426
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You bumped your head, that's all.

427
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And so Snork maiden's brief spell as a royal princess came to an end.

428
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Except that she was the only one who didn't remember it.

429
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But everyone else in woman valley breathed a sigh of relief.

430
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:12,000
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

431
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

432
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
They're always happy and always at play.

433
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

434
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:42,000
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

435
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

436
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
They're always happy and always at play.

437
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

438
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The movements.

439
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The movements.

440
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The movements.
