most of them anyway wonder if my brother's still up well he did say before we started

27
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,080
hibernating he wanted to finish his blueprints before spring if he could I hope you'll succeed

28
00:04:52,080 --> 00:05:00,400
this time when you go out outside just to see what the snow looks like oh no I don't really feel

29
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,600
like it it's nice and warm here why don't we sleep does spring like the others spring is still a

30
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,400
long way off guess you're right it is nice and warm in here

31
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,400

33
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:50,800
I'm so very hungry movement your mother's raspberry juice is really the best it is isn't it

34
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,040
everybody said that last winter too he moment yeah I have a funny feeling someone is watching us

35
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,960
and I don't like it one little bit moment poppacate explain it I'm sure of course someone's watching

36
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,640
what but who and how do you know to take you told me all about it last winter snort maiden she

37
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,000
doesn't hibernate you know she lives in our bathhouse and watches over us in the winter she said

38
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,880
that many things are too shy to show themselves oh have you seen them yourself short of except they

39
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:29,040
were invisible of course like under the sink or in the clock maybe in the empty fireplace and other

40
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,760
dark corners of the room I can feel it did you actually look anywhere for them oh no they'd be

41
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,960
very upset it's better not to let them know we know where they are I wonder what these things look

42
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,160
like some of them look very much like us two tiki said old ancestors of ours from way back she

43
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,160
thinks some of them look like as she said well I've never seen them for myself I wonder if there is

44
00:06:52,160 --> 00:07:03,600
good looking as we are wouldn't it be a good idea to stay up and wait for the sunrise a great idea

45
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,280
now don't say anything to scare them but this is one of the movement's ancestors from way back

46
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:24,880
is it morning already are you sure I think so there are no clouds so why can't we see the sun I guess

47
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,640
maybe the sun doesn't come up at all this time of the year mom and I don't like this I don't like

oh

73
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
oh

74
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,960
if you want to learn to fly on this bram Alicia then forget all about those

75
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,600
dreaded movements and really start studying it's hard work you know young woman you

76
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
let's learn concentrate

77
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:21,600
hey you up there are you making fun of me too

78
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:35,600
oh I can't climb down there of course you can even if you fall you can't hurt yourself on this soft snow

79
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,520
don't shake the ladder Moomin this is scary slowly does it take it easy as

80
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,520
you can don't look down maybe going out wasn't such a good idea after all

81
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,520
we can always change our mind to go back to sleep you know

82
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,520
see you've made it it's very cold out here Moomin but I'd rather like it

83
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,520
this is the roof over the front door isn't it yes and everything will be snowed up now to spring oh no

84
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,520
what's happened to our firewood

85
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:15,840
what's the matter there's not much wood left in here someone else must be burning it

86
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:23,760
yes but who and for what I wonder I can feel it we're not alone in this forest I'm sure

87
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,720
someone's watching us all those winter creatures no I don't think it's them

88
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,840
the grog

89
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,680
goodness me look how big she gets in the winter time

90
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,480
Moomin I'm scared it'll be all right

91
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,600
grog stop right there

92
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,720
don't come any closer if you please you're much much too cold for us you see

93
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,800
you could freeze a stiff you know oh is it possible that you get lonely all by yourself

94
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,920
I don't think there's anything we can do to help you know not without fur coats and earmuffs and

95
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,480
more gloves anyway we must go

96
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,600
someone's been stealing our firewood I wonder what they're doing with it

97
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:43,280
something bad there's no doubt about that must have been several people did this

98
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,520
we had a lot of fun here in the summer remember well the she is still here

99
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:13,520
round of the ice I hope too ticky too ticky there's no one here are you sure look for yourself

100
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,640
I know they're invisible but I'm a shrewmice in here hard to tell with things you can't see

101
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,880
oh what is it it felt like something scampering on my back that's all right it must be one of the shrewmice

102
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:49,440
oh my god my goodness I've never seen anything quite like this before hi it's good to see you

103
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,880
you're right she's fishing hi to ticky hello to ticky so this winter's not meant to walk up to huh

104
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:03,600
uh uh I walk her up by mistake you know that spring is still a long way off don't you I thought it

105
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,520
might be seeing there's no sun at all but the sun is going to come back tomorrow woman tomorrow

106
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,680
snorkemaiden was so worried about the sun not showing the sun will rise tomorrow woman but it'll

107
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,720
go down very soon to ticky you know I think there must be records in moving valley records in winter

108
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,440
there's an enormous pile of firewood up on the hillside I know it took a long time to collect that

109
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,080
wood but some of it belongs to us that doesn't really surprise me though woman I'm afraid the

110
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,920
winner creatures unfair careful about ownership they need a lot so if they see it they take it it's

111
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:49,280
for their big winner bonfire a bonfire yes and now your firewood can take part in the big celebration

112
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,440
they light it every winter to make sure the sun comes back you know oh you mean otherwise the sun

113
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,160
wouldn't come back to ticky well since they always light it on this day you don't really know do you

114
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,000
tonight you might see the winner creatures okay we come along as well to ticky yes you can if you

115
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,960
sit quietly and don't scare them in any way wonderful you're coming along too aren't you

00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:19,520

117
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,960
go away get away from me I didn't do it on purpose I didn't mean any harm if you don't leave

118

119
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720

121
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,400
movement Alicia now listen Grog why can't you be nice to her Alicia's one of my friends she was

122
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,440
just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis I nearly bumped into her but

123
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,960
I didn't touch her that's all right Alicia tell me Grog what's gotten into you why you so nasty

124
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:11,040
to such a sweet little girl it isn't like you at all I must have startled her I guess and I did

125
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,040
apologize and all but it made no difference this is really very odd then I asked if she had seen

126
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,280
you and that's when she started to get mad at me but she doesn't even know me it's a mystery

127
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,280
whatever's the matter with you Grog

128
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:46,880
oh it was so scared I'm so glad you've come to see us so am I moment somehow I felt certain you

129
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,560
hadn't gone into hibernation yet but what did your grandmother say nothing because I

130
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,000
didn't tell her I was coming thank you for chasing off that terrible monster the Grog hasn't

131
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,640
actually ever attacked anyone well maybe she doesn't like the look of Alicia snork maiden oh it's

132
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:10,960
really a mystery to me why the Grog was here at all she was here looking for a moment no doubt was

133
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,560
she he suddenly become very popular you don't mean

134
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:38,000
what's the matter with you I think the Grog may have fallen in love with you movement what oh you

135
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,400
can't mean that please tell me you're not serious it's out of the question it's a ridiculous idea don't

136
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
be so silly

137
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,360
oh

138
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:10,480
where's all that drumming noise coming from from the invisible shroom ice how long before everybody

139
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,960
oh they're here already movement all around us they are where I can't see them

140
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:24,240
are they really invisible I can't see them either but I can feel their presence all around me

141
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,320
but she's been studying witchcraft hasn't she I'm sure you and movement will be able to feel

142
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
their presence quite soon

143
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:10,320
oh

144
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,120
I can see some of them look they're over there

145
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
I see them too you guys

146
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,360
do you think you tell me why can't we see all of them well we can never see them all

147
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,000
I don't understand how did you know earlier on the shroom ice were playing the drums

148
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,360
I just know because they sometimes play them in the batch house as well

149
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,560
what a wonderful celebration isn't it lucky I came over here if I had not

150
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
had missed a most memorable evening

151
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,520
what's going on here the grog what

152
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:28,960
what's she doing she must be looking for movement again I guess no I think she just wants to warm

153
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,920
this up by the fire

154
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,920
what's she doing

155
00:19:49,920 --> 00:20:02,880
oh that's the end of the midwinter bonfire pull grog she freezes everything she touches
