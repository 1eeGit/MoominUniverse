0	21000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.
29000	35000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.
35000	46000	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,
46000	58000	there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.
76000	106000	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
106000	136000	ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
136000	139600	Tiki's arrival was very welcome.
139600	141340	Good evening, Mom.
141340	145280	Tiki, come in.
145280	147680	Mama, Tiki's here.
147680	150280	Come on in, Minnie, a neat Moman.
150280	153600	Uh-oh.
153600	155280	Is there someone with you?
155280	157400	Yes, I brought my friend, Minnie.
157400	162160	Minnie, don't be shy.
162160	163280	Well, there's no one there.
163280	164360	Yes, there is.
164360	166200	You just can't see her.
166200	167640	Really?
167640	172280	Yes, I'm afraid she's very, very shy.
172280	174480	I'll leave the door open for you, Minnie.
174480	176320	Come in when you're ready.
176320	178640	She'll get soaked if she stays out there.
178640	182680	Maybe that doesn't matter very much if you're invisible.
182680	183520	Oh.
186440	188320	Tiki, how nice.
188320	193120	What is everyone looking at?
193120	203920	About Minnie, you know sometimes when people are very frightened, they can become invisible
203920	206160	to the people around them.
206160	211720	Poor Minnie, she's looked after by an aunt who doesn't like her and is really horrible
211720	215840	to her and who only does it because she thinks it's her duty.
215840	219560	It wouldn't be so bad if she just got mad and yelled at her.
219560	223040	But she's cold and sarcastic, which is much worse.
223040	227640	She doesn't care if Minnie is unhappy and gives her horrible jobs.
227640	229680	What's sarcastic?
229680	231760	Uh, let's see.
231760	234000	Suppose you tripped and fell over.
234000	235880	What would Moman Mama say?
235880	238760	Well, she does mean if I'd hurt myself.
238760	243640	Yes, well, you're lucky that Moman Mama is so nice, but a lot of people would be mad
243640	244640	at you.
244640	249720	This nasty old lady would say, that may be your idea of dancing, but try not to do it
249720	252040	when people are eaten, please.
252040	254000	Gosh, that's horrible.
254000	260160	Anyway, she just went on being more and more horrible to her so that in the end, Minnie
260160	262680	was so upset she became invisible.
262680	267640	On her answer, she couldn't be bothered to look after little girl she couldn't see.
267640	270480	Poor Minnie.
270480	272480	So she asked me to do it.
272480	273960	Minnie's still outside.
273960	278160	Too nervous to come in.
278160	280360	But what did you do to this old aunt?
280360	283040	I hope you told her she heard Minnie's feelings.
283040	287120	She wouldn't have done any good, not with someone like her.
287120	291920	So I took Minnie home, and then as you're the nicest family I know, I brought her here
291920	293720	so you could make her visible again.
293720	296560	You were very flattered, of course, too, Tiki.
296560	297560	But, uh...
297560	302320	If anyone could do it, you and Moman Mama can, and Moman can play with her.
302320	304240	Because she'd talk at all to Tiki.
304240	305240	I'm afraid not.
305240	307240	Not since she became invisible.
307240	308240	Oh, dear.
308240	313160	I'm sure I can think of lots of games, but it'll be hard to play if I can't see her.
313160	315680	She'll be really good at hiding seat, though.
315680	317160	Oh, it's okay.
317160	322160	You'll know where she is because her aunt hung a little bell around her neck.
326160	328760	Ah, look, the door's opened.
328760	330760	That'll be nanny.
333320	335320	Come here, nanny.
335320	337320	It's all right.
337320	339320	Don't be frightened.
339320	341320	Come and meet everyone.
341320	346320	This is your new home, and this is Moman Mama and Moman Papa.
346320	348320	They're both very nice.
348320	351320	Hello, I'm Moman, and these are my friends.
354320	356320	We were just having some tea.
356320	357320	Would you like some?
357320	360320	Oh, that is, if you can drink.
361320	364320	Oh, perhaps I should make some lemonade.
366320	370320	Well, now, perhaps you'd all like to go back to the table, eh?
370320	372320	If you'd care to sit down, nanny.
376320	379320	I'm sorry I don't know any more about her,
379320	383320	but I'm sure that everything will be okay now she's here.
383320	385320	I'm certain it will.
385320	387320	We'll do our best, Tiki.
388320	390320	Here you are, nanny.
397320	401320	Well, she seems to be okay now, so I better be getting along.
401320	403320	I've got a lot of things to do.
403320	407320	I'll try and come over to see how you're all going.
407320	409320	That would really be nice.
412320	414320	Oh, it's better.
414320	416320	You have got room, haven't you?
416320	419320	Didn't you have someone else stand?
419320	420320	Ah, yes.
420320	422320	A thing I mean, Bob, but it's all right.
422320	424320	They left last week.
424320	426320	That's okay then.
430320	432320	Oh, you must have been thirsty.
432320	434320	Would you like some more?
436320	437320	Sure.
447320	449320	Oh, are you coming up with me?
449320	451320	That's nice, nanny.
465320	468320	This is your very own room.
468320	471320	You'll be warm and cozy here.
471320	474320	I've put the lemonade on the table,
474320	478320	so you can have a drink whenever you want.
478320	482320	Are you sure you wouldn't like something to eat?
482320	485320	Ah, I see, you want to go to bed.
485320	489320	Well, you had a busy day, so you must be tired out.
489320	492320	Don't forget, if you feel frightened or lonely during the night,
492320	495320	just come and wake me up and we'll have a talk.
495320	498320	If you like, you can tinkle your little bell in my ear,
498320	501320	and that should do it, nanny dear.
502320	505320	Sweet dreams. Sleep well.
516320	517320	She asleep?
517320	518320	Yes.
520320	523320	I was wondering whether there's anything that might help her
523320	526320	in your granny's book of household remedies.
526320	528320	I don't know if there's a cure for invisibility.
529320	531320	I can't remember, but I'll have a look.
531320	533320	There's a remedy for most things.
533320	535320	I'm a phone believer in granny's remedy.
535320	538320	I know you are dear. I'll go and see.
539320	541320	I wonder what you looked like.
548320	549320	Ah, there it is.
549320	553320	Now then, a droopy tail, evil eye, melancholy.
555320	557320	Ah, this must be it.
558320	563320	The prescription was at the end of the book,
563320	567320	and shakily written, but it looked like the right one.
567320	571320	It said, remedy for when people start getting misty
571320	573320	and difficult to see.
573320	575320	It was very complicated.
588320	591320	I wonder whether it's the right one.
591320	594320	I wonder whether it's the right one.
594320	597320	I wonder whether it's the right one.
597320	600320	I wonder whether it's the right one.
600320	602320	I wonder whether it's the right one.
602320	605320	Do you think it's going to work, Mama?
605320	608320	Granny's remedies usually do, so don't worry.
608320	610320	Yes, you're right.
610320	613320	I wonder whether we ought to go and wake her up.
618320	621320	Look, you can see many shoes.
642320	644320	Papa! Papa!
644320	646320	Oh, good morning, little my.
647320	649320	Is Ninny up yet?
649320	651320	Yeah, she is.
651320	654320	Where is she? She hasn't eaten yet, has she?
654320	657320	I don't know, and she's probably in the dining room.
657320	659320	Oh, no!
666320	668320	I'm too late!
668320	670320	I'd be quiet, you two.
670320	673320	Ninny's just finishing her breakfast.
673320	676320	Come on, drink it all up.
678320	679320	That's good.
679320	681320	It should start to work in a couple of hours.
681320	683320	Well done, Ninny.
683320	686320	Look, her shoes are floating.
686320	689320	Yeah, and soon we'll be seeing the rest of her.
689320	691320	Ha, they look silly.
691320	693320	I think they're very nice feet.
693320	695320	I know who and Mama's remedies are good,
695320	697320	but I can't see them working that fast.
697320	701320	Anyway, you must look pretty bad if you want to make yourself invisible.
701320	703320	Don't let little my upset you, Ninny.
703320	705320	It's only the way she talks.
705320	706320	She doesn't mean it.
706320	708320	Oh, yes, I do.
708320	710320	I'm bored, Moomin.
710320	712320	Well, what shall we do then, Moomin?
712320	714320	I don't know.
714320	715320	Let's go mushroom picking.
715320	717320	That's boring, I never find any.
717320	719320	Well, I do.
719320	722320	Would you like to come, Ninny?
722320	725320	Good, and we can see who can pick the most, shall we?
725320	727320	They all look the same to me,
727320	730320	so you'll have to tell me which ones are safe to eat.
732320	734320	I'll tell you.
747320	749320	Papa! Papa!
749320	752320	Look, Papa, you can see Ninny's shoes now.
752320	754320	Oh, that's good.
754320	756320	There's not many things Mama's potions won't cure.
756320	757320	Oh, it can't be that.
757320	759320	She only took it a minute ago.
760320	763320	Well, it might be that it works faster if you're completely invisible.
763320	766320	I think it's being away from that horrid out.
766320	768320	Yes, it could be.
768320	771320	Mama, we're taking Ninny mushroom picking.
771320	773320	Have a nice time.
773320	775320	Morning!
775320	777320	Morning!
777320	779320	Hello.
780320	782320	Where's Ninny?
790320	792320	Oh!
802320	804320	Huh!
807320	810320	Wow, what a lot of mushrooms!
814320	817320	You seem to know where to find all the best ones, Ninny.
819320	822320	It's so fair. I haven't gotten half as many.
822320	825320	How are you doing, Momen?
825320	830320	Wow, that must be about four times as many as I've got.
830320	833320	Uh, yeah, that's right.
833320	836320	You've never picked that many before.
836320	840320	You know, Momen, I think there's something fishy about this.
843320	846320	Uh-huh, so they're not yours at all.
846320	849320	Well, not really, no.
850320	852320	Ninny's enjoyed herself.
852320	855320	I bet her yucky old aunt never let her go mushroom picking.
855320	859320	She was probably only allowed to carry the baskets, the really heavy ones.
859320	862320	Oh, how awful for her.
866320	868320	They're stinky.
868320	870320	What's he up to now?
870320	872320	I'll take care of him.
872320	874320	Hello, Momen, long time no see.
874320	876320	Not long enough.
876320	879320	Last time you dipped my swimming shorts in glue.
879320	881320	You know, I thought that was very funny.
881320	884320	Hey, what's that basket floating around up there for?
884320	887320	I don't want to be rude, but mind your own business.
887320	889320	It looks like the Hobgoblins work.
889320	892320	Boy, just think of all the things you could do if you were invisible.
892320	894320	Ninny, I'll carry your basket.
894320	895320	Let's go.
895320	898320	It stinks here.
898320	900320	Hey, you!
900320	902320	Isn't it me a name or just a description?
902320	905320	What's wrong? Is your voice invisible, too?
905320	907320	Please stop it, stinky.
907320	909320	Can't you see you're frightening her?
909320	911320	Oh, it's a girl, is it?
911320	913320	Why doesn't she speak for herself?
913320	916320	She's stupid. What a perfect name for her, Ninny.
916320	918320	Now look, stinky.
918320	920320	Oh, yes, Momen. Now look what?
920320	924320	You stop upsetting Ninny or I'll get really angry.
924320	927320	Without those feet, she'd be perfect for a back robbery.
927320	931320	Well, she's getting visible again, so she'll be no good to you at all, stinky.
931320	936320	You couldn't see any of her yesterday, not even the feet.
936320	938320	They're disappearing again.
938320	941320	You have to do a scare of it.
941320	944320	Oh, see? She's gone.
944320	947320	It's all your fault, stinky.
947320	951320	Yes, and like I told you before, she'd make a brilliant back robbery.
951320	954320	Don't you agree? Perfect.
954320	957320	Ninny would never do such a thing as that.
957320	960320	And anyway, Mama's given her one of Granny's magic remedies.
960320	963320	She'll soon be visible again, so they're there.
971320	973320	Whose basket is this?
973320	975320	Mine in little mice.
975320	978320	Well, there's not many of them, but they certainly are pretty.
978320	983320	There weren't many left for us to get, because Ninny has picked them all.
983320	986320	It doesn't really matter how many you've got because you can't eat them.
986320	989320	Let me show you.
989320	991320	Now, this is deadly, tufted toadstool.
991320	993320	And this is cow's bane.
993320	997320	You must remember what they look like.
997320	1000320	Ah, these are movements and sniff, I should think.
1000320	1002320	We didn't pick any poisoners once.
1002320	1007320	Not quite as many as snorkemaiden and little mice, but this is body fly bane
1007320	1009320	and insiduous pepper spunk.
1009320	1011320	And you've both got cow's bane, too.
1011320	1013320	You must be more careful.
1013320	1014320	Now, this is better.
1014320	1017320	There's not one mushroom in here that you can't eat.
1017320	1020320	How did Ninny manage to do this all on her own?
1020320	1022320	What a very clever girl she is.
1022320	1024320	Ninny, where are you?
1024320	1026320	Come here a minute.
1026320	1027320	Ninny, didn't you hear?
1027320	1029320	Mama wants you.
1032320	1035320	Ninny, this is a beautiful mushroom basket.
1035320	1037320	We'll have a feast tonight.
1039320	1041320	Her feet have come back.
1042320	1044320	Oh, I'm so glad.
1044320	1046320	We'll soon be able to see your face.
1046320	1048320	It won't take long at all, Ninny.
1048320	1050320	And you mustn't worry about stinky one little bit.
1050320	1052320	He's all talk.
1052320	1055320	If something upsets you, just think of something else.
1055320	1058320	At least that's my philosophy in life.
1058320	1061320	If somebody upsets you, ignore him.
1061320	1063320	That's my philosophy, Ninny.
1063320	1066320	Anyone who picks mushrooms like this deserves to be seen.
1066320	1069320	You mustn't let anything frighten you when you're with us.
1069320	1071320	Do you understand?
1074320	1077320	Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.
1077320	1079320	That's just great, Ninny.
1079320	1081320	Oh, that's wonderful, Ninny.
1081320	1082320	Wonderful.
1082320	1084320	I can't wait to see all of you.
1084320	1086320	It won't be long now.
1086320	1089320	But I don't think Mouse Gray is quite your color, you know.
1100320	1102320	You just sleep as long as you like, Ninny.
1102320	1103320	Good night now.
1103320	1105320	If you want anything, you just shout.
1129320	1132320	Oh, where's Mom and Mama?
1159320	1164320	Well, well, what are you doing?
1164320	1167320	I mean, do you know what time it is?
1167320	1169320	Do you like this moment, Papa?
1169320	1170320	Hmm.
1170320	1173320	Yes, it's very nice.
1173320	1176320	It's good to have someone in the house to make clothes for it last.
1176320	1178320	I hope it'll look pretty on her.
1178320	1179320	What's this for?
1179320	1180320	Her hair.
1189320	1191320	praise.
1196320	1213320	ok
1213320	1215320	Good morning mum and Papa.
1215320	1217320	Good morning little Mai.
1217320	1218320	You're very early today.
1218320	1220320	You're a burly?
1220320	1222320	I can't wait to see her.
1222320	1223320	Come on, man.
1229320	1232320	It's like waiting for Christmas, isn't it?
1232320	1235320	Yeah, I like having presents every day.
1235320	1237320	Isn't it, Papa?
1237320	1240320	Well, I think it's much more exciting this way.
1240320	1243320	We have to wait until she's ready to come down.
1243320	1246320	Did you hear that door opening?
1246320	1248320	She's awake!
1250320	1253320	I hope she found the dress where I left it on the table.
1253320	1255320	Oh, good.
1255320	1257320	It's all right.
1257320	1259320	Now, you know where to look.
1261320	1263320	Well, it's time to go to bed.
1273320	1275320	Oh, good.
1275320	1277320	It's all right.
1277320	1279320	Now, you know where to look.
1279320	1283320	Well, she's OK, I suppose.
1289320	1293320	Thank you all very much for everything.
1293320	1295320	Oh.
1295320	1297320	Ha! So she can talk!
1301320	1303320	They still couldn't see Nini's face.
1303320	1305320	But at least they knew that she was there,
1305320	1307320	that she was talking to them.
1307320	1309320	I've made them all feel a lot better.
1309320	1311320	Stork made them. Look!
1327320	1333320	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the romance.
1333320	1341320	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1341320	1345320	They're always happy and always at play.
1345320	1349320	The movements are having fun day after day.
1349320	1353320	The movements.
1353320	1355320	The movements.
1355320	1361320	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
1363320	1371320	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1371320	1375320	They're always happy and always at play.
1375320	1379320	The movements are having fun day after day.
1379320	1381320	The movements.
1381320	1385320	The movements.
1385320	1391320	The movements.
1393320	1397320	The movements.
