0	2500	Oh, what exactly is it you're observing?
2500	5500	I'm sure I saw a beautiful crayfish in there.
5500	9500	Crayfish? Excuse me, young man, but that is zoology.
9500	12500	Quite the most uninteresting field.
12500	14500	There it is.
42500	49500	Oh! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
73500	79500	I got him! I got him!
79500	84500	I got him!
96500	98500	A dragon?
103500	107500	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
107500	109500	Papa!
112500	114500	Oh, what have you got there?
114500	115500	Oh, oh, nothing, Papa!
115500	118500	Everything's so fresh after the rain, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
118500	120500	Yes it is.
123500	127500	I gotta show this to Snuffkin before anybody else sees it.
133500	134500	Mm-hmm.
140500	142500	Oh!
145500	146500	Mm-hmm.
146500	148500	Boom, moment!
148500	150500	What have you got there, Moomin?
150500	152500	Oh, oh, nothing! Nothing at all, little lion.
152500	155500	Oh, yes, you have, I saw it! Don't lie to me!
155500	158500	It's just one of Mama's old jars.
158500	160500	Liar, liar, I know there's something.
160500	161500	I don't think there's nothing.
162500	164500	Then why are you hiding it?
167500	170500	Oh, why did a little lion see me, it's not fair.
178500	180500	Dragon?
180500	182500	Ah, yeah, I was right.
183500	188500	It must be a baby dragon, probably the very last one on earth and washed up by the rain.
189500	191500	A dragon of my own.
192500	194500	That's wonderful.
195500	197500	Oh, I hope I didn't frighten you.
200500	205500	I know what I'll do, I'll take the lid off the jar so you can get some fresh air, little dragon.
210500	212500	See, that's better, isn't it?
212500	215500	Come on little fella, we'll give you a car to make you feel better.
219500	221500	Oh, that burnt me!
223500	225500	What a piercing dragon you are!
225500	227500	Don't worry, I'll look after you.
227500	229500	I'll take good care of you.
229500	233500	And when you're bigger and start to like me, I'll take you swimming in the sea.
236500	239500	Oh, I'm sorry, you must be starving.
239500	242500	I'll get you something from my nighttime emergency food box.
242500	246500	I've got lots of things in there, bound to be something you like.
248500	251500	The one, take anything you want.
279500	284500	Gosh, that's really clever little dragon.
285500	288500	Moving, lunch is ready.
288500	289500	Coming!
290500	291500	Now you stay here.
291500	294500	Don't worry, I'll be back in no time at all.
295500	298500	Remember, you're my own little dragon.
299500	300500	Oh!
305500	308500	Where's Sniff? I thought he was here as well.
308500	310500	He's collecting worms for fishing.
310500	311500	He'll be here soon.
311500	313500	We'll start without him then.
313500	317500	You know, Mama, certain people keep secrets in glass jars.
317500	318500	Secrets?
320500	324500	Oh, yes, a little secret that hisses.
325500	328500	Moment, Mama, I found this near the big puddle.
330500	331500	Thank you, Sniff.
331500	334500	Moment, I told you I wanted it back.
334500	336500	It's my very best one.
336500	340500	Sorry, Mama, I was so excited I must have left it when I found...
340500	341500	I mean, when I was...
341500	344500	And I'm sure you know who I mean by certain people.
344500	347500	Did you catch anything with the sieve, Moment?
347500	351500	Yes, he did. Something that's now hidden in his room.
352500	353500	Big mouth.
353500	356500	If it's a secret little my, perhaps he doesn't want to tell anyone.
356500	359500	Yeah, probably because his new pet bites.
359500	361500	Well, it hasn't bitten you yet, hasn't it?
361500	363500	Huh, if it did, I'd bite it back.
363500	367500	Is it true? Does your secret really bite people?
367500	371500	Well, it couldn't bite very hard if it was small enough to go in a jar, could it, Papa?
371500	375500	I suppose certain people might keep other small things in jars,
375500	380500	beetles and spiders, mosquitoes, scorpions, or poisonous centipedes, horrible things.
380500	385500	That multiply and multiply every week and grow and grow until the jars are too small.
387500	389500	See? Like that.
389500	394500	And there'll be so many of them, thousands and thousands, and they'll take over Moon Valley and eat us all.
394500	397500	Oh, well, I haven't got a centipede.
397500	400500	Hmm, I wonder if centipedes come from outer space.
400500	402500	But this is the Earth's deer.
402500	405500	The rain could have brought them down from space, Mama, couldn't it?
405500	409500	Well, you could be right. It was raining very hard yesterday.
409500	412500	And it wasn't like ordinary rain.
412500	415500	I saw a puddle as big as a lake.
417500	418500	What's the matter, Moon?
418500	420500	It isn't a centipede.
422500	425500	Ha, we're on the right track, though.
425500	429500	Well, I'm glad it's not a poisonous centipede. I shouldn't have liked that.
430500	434500	Oh, you're asleep. Moonman's little dragon.
437500	440500	Is it okay if I go see snuffkin, Mama?
440500	442500	Have you finished already?
442500	448500	Yes, I have. Tell them they mustn't go into my room. Or they'll have to take the consequence.
448500	452500	All right, Moonman. I'll make sure no one thinks.
452500	454500	I promise.
454500	457500	Oh, but he's going to tell snuffkin this secret.
457500	459500	I should think he is.
459500	462500	Best friends always come first, little my.
483500	485500	Hey, snuffkin!
488500	489500	Hi!
489500	491500	Fishing again?
491500	496500	Yep. The cards told me that if I caught five minutes, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south.
496500	498500	South?
498500	500500	You're joking!
500500	502500	Not at all. I believe in the cards.
502500	505500	But snuffkin, winter's not here yet.
505500	509500	I know that. But the cards tell you things for a reason, Moonman.
509500	514500	Oh, do they really? But it would be awfully few anyway, snuffkin. Just awful.
514500	516500	I mean, I'd be very lonely.
516500	520500	Well, anyway, who would I talk to or tell my secrets to?
522500	526500	Oh, snuffkin, quickly! You always come up to Moonman House.
526500	527500	Now?
527500	528500	Yeah.
528500	530500	Well, I suppose I could fish later.
530500	532500	No, no, there's no point.
532500	534500	But I have to catch five minutes.
534500	535500	Oh!
535500	541500	The fish won't bite after all his rain. You'd catch nothing. It'll be better to wait until it stops flowing so fast.
541500	543500	Well, perhaps you're right.
543500	546500	So what's this big secret all about?
546500	548500	Hey, Moonman.
548500	551500	Have you ever seen a dragon snuffkin?
551500	556500	No, of course not. They all disappeared off the face of the earth many hundreds of years ago.
556500	561500	But perhaps they didn't all disappear. What if there was one alive somewhere?
561500	563500	That's impossible.
563500	566500	It could be so small that it would go in a glass jar, snuffkin.
566500	571500	Are you sure you're not daydreaming, Moonman? But still, anything is possible, I suppose.
571500	575500	But you know me. I have to see it right in front of me before I believe it.
578500	581500	Oh!
581500	583500	Oh, where is it?
584500	586500	Oh, where is it?
586500	589500	Mama promised me that she wouldn't let anyone in.
594500	596500	It's not here either.
596500	598500	Well, you were right, Moonman.
598500	600500	Huh?
604500	606500	Ah, there he is.
606500	608500	I think you've found a real dragon.
608500	612500	How do you get up there? He must have full. He might lose his tail.
612500	615500	Oh, little dragon. And snuffkin, keep quiet.
615500	617500	You might get frightened and do something silly.
617500	619500	Don't worry. I'll soon have you down.
619500	622500	This will do. I'll lay it on the floor here.
622500	625500	Jump, little dragon. Don't be afraid.
625500	628500	Come on. Hold on to this. It will bring you down slowly.
628500	630500	Don't panic.
630500	633500	I don't think it's a very good idea, Moonman.
633500	635500	You'll only scare him away.
635500	637500	Why don't you just leave him alone?
637500	641500	He'll come down when he's ready. Dragons aren't helpless, you know. Even little baby ones.
641500	644500	But he's so small. Come to Moonman.
644500	647500	Come on. Don't you understand?
647500	649500	Hold on to that and I'll listen to that.
661500	662500	Look at him.
662500	666500	My dragon can fly. He's flying. He's flying.
666500	669500	Come down, little dragon. You might question or something.
669500	671500	Come down.
679500	682500	Be careful snuffkin. He might bite.
695500	698500	I don't think so. He's a very unusual pet.
699500	702500	I think he likes you more than me.
710500	712500	What a charming little creature, Moonman.
712500	714500	He's lovely. What's his name?
714500	716500	He's called Little Dragon.
716500	718500	Ha. I don't think he's lovely at all.
718500	721500	Small but savage, if you ask my opinion.
721500	723500	That sounds just like you, little my.
723500	725500	You think so?
725500	726500	Ow!
729500	731500	Ow, ow, ow.
734500	736500	Now look here.
739500	742500	He seems to have a thing about ears, doesn't he?
742500	744500	Step snuffkins. Why doesn't he bite him?
744500	749500	Go on, dragon. Go on, bite him. He's really tasty. Go on.
750500	755500	Good news. I think he's trying to heat up snuffkins coffee. He must really like him.
758500	760500	Clevver, little sea.
760500	764500	Well, I hope he's careful with that hot breath. We don't want to start a fire.
764500	766500	All right, that's enough.
768500	771500	He might be useful. When he's bigger, we can put him in the cellar
771500	774500	and he'll be able to heat the whole house just like a furnace.
774500	776500	No, we will not.
784500	786500	Go away! You pass!
788500	790500	Ow!
790500	792500	And you!
792500	795500	He only thought you were trying to get his fly.
795500	799500	I'll get him if he bites me again. Just you watch me do it.
799500	801500	Come on, little dragon.
801500	803500	Ow!
815500	819500	I'm sure that'll keep him quiet. That better go. Thanks for the coffee, Mumma.
832500	834500	Oh no, it'll suffocate him.
853500	855500	He only seems to like snuffkin.
855500	857500	Well, we all like snuffkin.
857500	859500	Stupid old dragon.
860500	862500	No, he isn't.
862500	867500	Mum and dear, why don't you take him to your room? He'll be happier there.
870500	872500	This will be best for him.
875500	878500	Oh, I wonder if he'll come back to visit us.
878500	882500	Why did you do that? He was cute and we could have always worn earmuffs.
882500	884500	You can visit him in snuffkin's tent.
884500	887500	I expect little dragons already sitting on his shoulder.
888500	891500	It doesn't matter anyway, snuffkin's going south soon.
891500	893500	They'll be able to go together.
893500	896500	Oh, my dear, Mumma. Never mind.
902500	904500	Well, you're a bit of a problem.
904500	906500	I don't want you here, little dragon.
906500	909500	Go on, go away. Go to Mumma.
909500	911500	Don't do that.
911500	913500	Oh, come on, please go to Mumma.
914500	917500	Look, you're very nice and it'll be fun to have you along.
917500	921500	But there's movement, and he'd know you were here and you'd be upset.
921500	923500	Oh, there's another one.
931500	934500	That's the fifth? Oh, dear.
935500	937500	Hmm?
941500	943500	Any luck?
943500	945500	Not bad. Are you going far?
945500	947500	Oh, I'm far away.
947500	949500	Would you like some fresh fish?
950500	952500	I'm sure you'll get hungry.
954500	956500	Yeah, what do you want in return?
957500	959500	A small favor.
965500	970500	Take this as far as you can, open the lid and just leave it.
970500	972500	What? Just leave it?
972500	977500	Yes, in a nice quiet place, with lots and lots of flies.
977500	979500	Flies? What's in there?
979500	980500	A dragon.
980500	982500	A dragon? Does it bite?
982500	983500	Well, it might.
983500	986500	This is a big favor. I don't even like minnows.
986500	989500	Oh, they're not too bad if you roast them.
989500	993500	Keep the lid on, but make sure you open it up later so it can catch the flies.
994500	997500	All right, as long as it doesn't try to bite me.
997500	999500	Don't worry, it won't.
1011500	1012500	Hello.
1012500	1013500	Hi.
1013500	1016500	Oh, well, where is he?
1016500	1017500	Who is that?
1017500	1020500	My dragon. He must have come here, snuffkin.
1021500	1024500	Oh, really? I thought he was home with you, sleeping in your room.
1024500	1027500	No, I left him out.
1027500	1029500	Ah, well, dragons are very fickle.
1029500	1032500	All they really care about is big fat flies.
1032500	1034500	It's best to forget about a moment.
1038500	1040500	Did you catch your five minnows?
1040500	1043500	No, you were right. The water's too fast.
1043500	1044500	Oh, really?
1044500	1046500	So I won't go south until winter comes.
1046500	1048500	You'll stay here then?
1048500	1051500	Well, I'm sure it wouldn't do to go against the cards.
1051500	1053500	Now what a moment, my friend.
1053500	1056500	Oh, that's great. You're staying snuffkin.
1056500	1060500	That's fantastic. That's really, really good.
1060500	1063500	Ah, perhaps I shouldn't have painted the float bright red.
1063500	1066500	It might have scared those little minnows right away.
1066500	1067500	Okay, let's go.
1067500	1068500	Yeah.
1071500	1074500	That dragon was sort of stupid.
1074500	1075500	Baby dragons are.
1075500	1077500	They make the world's worst pets.
1077500	1079500	They never want to settle in one place.
1079500	1081500	Yeah, you're right.
1081500	1084500	It was very funny, though, when it bit little mice here.
1084500	1087500	I think it gave her a taste of her own medicine.
1088500	1092500	The movement was very happy that snuffkin was staying in movement valley
1092500	1095500	and not going south until winter.
1095500	1101500	And as for the dragon, well, who wants to be loved by a silly old dragon?
1101500	1108500	They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.
1108500	1115500	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1115500	1119500	They're always happy and always at play.
1119500	1123500	The movements are having fun day after day.
1123500	1126500	The movements.
1126500	1130500	The movements.
1130500	1137500	They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.
1137500	1144500	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1144500	1148500	They're always happy and always at play.
1148500	1152500	The movements are having fun day after day.
1152500	1155500	The movements.
1155500	1159500	The movements.
1159500	1166500	The movements.
1185500	1188500	Here they are for one another.
1188500	1191500	The movements are about to come.
1191500	1194500	Come on and sit down here with me.
1194500	1196500	Therefore you want your TV.
1196500	1199500	They are the movements.
1199500	1202500	They are the movements.
1202500	1205500	So come with me, give me your hand.
1205500	1208500	I'll take you up to a movement land.
1208500	1211500	You can fly just like a bird.
1211500	1213500	Sing that song ever.
1213500	1216500	There were the movements.
1216500	1221500	There were the movements.
1221500	1223500	There were the movements.
1223500	1226500	There were the movements.
1226500	1230500	There were the movements.

1290500	1292500	Have you found a new plant or something?
1292500	1297500	I'm afraid not, and I think I must have examined every single plant in Moomin Valley.
1297500	1299500	I know what you mean.
1299500	1302500	There isn't a single person living here that I don't know.
1302500	1305500	Oh, yes, yes, quite.
1305500	1310500	Look, why don't you come over and have a cup of tea, Mr. Evelyn?
1310500	1312500	Hmm?
1312500	1315500	Isn't that Moomin and little Mai?
1315500	1317500	Yes, I think it is.
1317500	1320500	Really, a moment, Papa, peeping into people's homes.
1320500	1323500	Oh, it's an empty house, Mr. Evelyn.
1323500	1327500	Oh, it's an empty house, Mr. Evelyn.
1327500	1330500	Moomin, what are you looking at?
1330500	1333500	Oh, what are you looking at?
1333500	1335500	I'm not looking at you.
1335500	1337500	I'm not looking at you.
1337500	1340500	Moomin, what are you looking at?
1340500	1341500	Oh, hello, Papa.
1341500	1343500	Nobody's lived in there for years.
1343500	1345500	Somebody's just moved in.
1345500	1347500	Oh, really?
1347500	1350500	Let me have a look.
1350500	1352500	Oh, goodness.
1352500	1353500	How tidy they are.
1353500	1356500	Perhaps the children will play with us.
1356500	1359500	Oh, they might, but they seem a bit too well behaved for that.
1359500	1361500	I must have a closer look at them.
1361500	1365500	Me too, Moomin, Papa, but the trouble is they never come outside the fence.
1365500	1367500	Well, in that case, we'll have to go in.
1367500	1369500	How do we do that, Papa?
1369500	1371500	We can't just walk in there.
1371500	1373500	See, you want to borrow some sugar?
1373500	1375500	That should do it.
1375500	1378500	Oh, Mr. Hamilton, where's your imagination?
1378500	1381500	Will you please lend me your magnifying glass?
1381500	1382500	But surely.
1382500	1384500	Here it is.
1384500	1388500	Oh, that should do it.
1388500	1393500	What are you going to do, Papa?
1393500	1396500	Now then, you all stay out here.
1396500	1399500	My plan will only work if it looks as though I'm on my own.
1399500	1403500	Oh, but what is your plan, Papa?
1413500	1415500	I hope Papa knows what he's doing.
1415500	1417500	They don't look that friendly to me.
1417500	1419500	Me neither.
1423500	1431500	Mama, there's someone coming.
1431500	1435500	Oh, what do you want, my good man?
1435500	1437500	Come on, tell me quickly.
1437500	1439500	Do you hear me?
1439500	1441500	Oh, I'm sorry.
1441500	1443500	I didn't think anyone lived here.
1443500	1446500	Well, we do know you know we just moved in.
1446500	1447500	Really?
1447500	1449500	Oh, do forgive me, madame.
1449500	1451500	I certainly didn't mean to trespass.
1451500	1454500	Ah, so what are you doing here in the garden, man?
1454500	1457500	Researching the travel system of ants.
1457500	1459500	I didn't know they had one.
1459500	1461500	Oh, yeah, yeah, it's fascinating.
1461500	1463500	How they find their way and build their roads,
1463500	1465500	and they're not here now, of course.
1465500	1467500	But this is their main road.
1467500	1470500	It's very quiet at the moment, but at busy times, it's packed.
1470500	1473500	I'm afraid I can't see any main road.
1473500	1475500	Oh, you would if you were an expert.
1475500	1478500	Anyway, I'll point it out to you next time they're on the move
1478500	1481500	in the vicinity, of course, but it's worth looking out for.
1481500	1483500	Welcome to Moomin Valley.
1483500	1485500	I'm your next door neighbor, though.
1485500	1486500	We live quite a long way away.
1486500	1487500	I'm Moomin.
1487500	1490500	Ah, so you must be Moomin Papa, aren't you?
1490500	1492500	Yes, that's me.
1492500	1495500	How did you know?
1495500	1498500	Did someone mention my name to you?
1498500	1502500	We were told the movements were a bit unusual.
1502500	1504500	Very nice, they said, though.
1504500	1507500	How very flattering, thank you.
1508500	1510500	And you're Mrs.
1510500	1513500	Billy Junk, mother and housewife.
1513500	1516500	Well, it's an honour to meet you, Mrs. Philly Junk.
1516500	1518500	Well done, Papa.
1518500	1521500	It looks like you found us some new friends to play with.
1521500	1523500	Oh, welcome, party.
1523500	1525500	Don't you think it's a good idea?
1525500	1528500	We haven't had a party for ages, Mama.
1528500	1532500	But you hardly know them, and I've never even met them.
1532500	1535500	But Mama, how can we show them that they're really welcome
1535500	1538500	if they could meet everyone at a party, couldn't they?
1538500	1540500	And I could take care of all the children.
1540500	1542500	I know just what to do.
1542500	1544500	Splendid, Moomin.
1544500	1547500	Ah, Mr. Hebblin, I know Moomin Papa.
1547500	1549500	You'd like me to do the fireworks.
1549500	1552500	It looks like we're throwing a party.
1555500	1557500	We'll have lots of pretty flowers.
1557500	1561500	Just tell me what you want, Mama, and we'll do it.
1565500	1568500	It's great.
1568500	1570500	Those kids will just love it.
1570500	1573500	If they survive, Moomin.
1587500	1589500	Now then, children.
1589500	1591500	The Moomin's are all a little bit odd.
1591500	1593500	So behead properly.
1593500	1596500	Yes, mother, we will.
1598500	1600500	They'll be here soon.
1600500	1602500	Take this in, Moomin.
1602500	1605500	Okay.
1605500	1607500	The children work really well.
1607500	1609500	Good. I must try it.
1609500	1610500	Mmm, these look nice.
1610500	1613500	Oh, stiff. Leave them alone, will you?
1613500	1616500	Oh, all right. Just this one.
1616500	1618500	Huh?
1618500	1620500	Huh? They're here.
1620500	1623500	Come on, everybody. They'll soon be at the door.
1623500	1625500	Right. Come on, children.
1625500	1628500	Help me with the flowers.
1630500	1633500	Oh, dear. Fireworks now are later on.
1633500	1637500	Oh, later on. I think you'll very whole-finally.
1643500	1645500	Welcome to Moomin House, Mrs. Fitzgerald.
1645500	1648500	It was very kind of you to invite us, Moomin, Mama.
1648500	1651500	Come in, please, and make yourselves at home.
1651500	1654500	Oh, thank you all very much indeed.
1659500	1662500	Welcome to Moomin Valley.
1662500	1666500	Oh, all in my hair.
1666500	1669500	It looks very untidy, doesn't it, mother?
1669500	1672500	It's a surprise. They should have been rose buds,
1672500	1674500	but we couldn't find any at all.
1674500	1677500	Oh, yes. Dear, what a mess.
1677500	1682500	Oh, Mrs. Philly chunk, let me introduce the children.
1682500	1684500	They all look different.
1684500	1687500	Well, yes. Only Moomin is really ours.
1687500	1692500	The others are sort of, uh, I'm sure they'll all get on.
1692500	1695500	Oh, I'm afraid my children do not play.
1695500	1698500	They would much rather read or study.
1698500	1702500	Oh, are you sure they've got to have some time for play?
1702500	1704500	I'm sure.
1705500	1709500	Well, come into the dining room anyway.
1709500	1711500	You can watch the others play.
1711500	1714500	Make sure the chairs are clean.
1714500	1716500	Yes, mother, we will.
1719500	1721500	Won't you let them play at all?
1721500	1723500	No, I will not.
1728500	1729500	Come on, everybody.
1729500	1731500	Wouldn't you like to have a go on our slide?
1731500	1733500	No.
1733500	1736500	Hmm. You'd really enjoy it once you got going.
1736500	1738500	I know you would.
1738500	1740500	No, thank you. No, no, not at all.
1740500	1743500	No, definitely not.
1743500	1746500	And you're really quite sure, are you?
1746500	1748500	Yes.
1748500	1750500	I thought so.
1750500	1753500	Then we've got it all to ourselves.
1755500	1757500	Yahoo!
1764500	1767500	Moomin sounds like he's having fun.
1777500	1780500	Oh, and that's little Mayan sniff.
1780500	1783500	Your children seem very quiet, Mrs. Billy Junk.
1783500	1787500	Good children are seen and not heard, my dear.
1790500	1792500	That was one of mine.
1793500	1795500	And that was another.
1795500	1798500	Well, it sounds like they're having fun for once.
1798500	1800500	Now, have a biscuit, Mrs. Billy Junk.
1800500	1802500	They have an unusual taste.
1802500	1805500	I'd run out of flowers, so I used them.
1807500	1809500	Don't worry.
1809500	1811500	Moomin will look after them.
1815500	1817500	Go on, it's your turn now.
1823500	1825500	My children.
1831500	1833500	Stop it. It's too dangerous.
1833500	1835500	You might hurt yourself.
1840500	1842500	Oh, come on, stop it at once.
1842500	1844500	Now, don't you worry, Mrs. Billy Junk.
1844500	1847500	I've got ointment in my bag if they hurt themselves.
1847500	1849500	But you'll hear mother.
1853500	1855500	Stop children, you hear me.
1855500	1857500	We're going home now.
1857500	1859500	Stop it.
1859500	1861500	Oh, this is great.
1861500	1864500	It's time for the glorious finale, Papa.
1864500	1867500	I can't say I wasn't warned.
1868500	1870500	Exposing them to this.
1870500	1873500	Moomin Valley is no place for proper children.
1873500	1875500	No place for children.
1875500	1877500	No place for children.
1877500	1879500	No place for children.
1879500	1881500	No place for children.
1881500	1883500	No place at all.
1884500	1886500	Oh, dear, what's this?
1886500	1889500	There are fireworks in your honor.
1889500	1890500	Fireworks.
1891500	1894500	I made them especially to welcome you.
1907500	1909500	Goodbye, come back soon.
1909500	1911500	Yeah, we'll come tomorrow.
1911500	1913500	No, you will not.
1913500	1916500	I don't think Mrs. Billy Junk enjoyed her party.
1916500	1918500	She's very lucky that I didn't bite her.
1920500	1922500	She should have had a go on the slide.
1922500	1924500	I'm sure she would have loved it,
1924500	1926500	and then she wouldn't have shouted at her children.
1926500	1928500	Don't, don't slide down, shoot, sniff.
1928500	1930500	They're too afraid of looking silly.
1930500	1932500	Whoa!
1932500	1934500	Oh, oh.
1934500	1936500	Papa.
1936500	1939500	Oh, I'm very sorry, Moomin, but don't worry.
1939500	1940500	I'll fix it.
1940500	1941500	Is it nothing much broken?
1941500	1943500	What happened, my dear?
1943500	1948500	Well, I thought it had been such a long time since I'd been on the slide that I'd have a go.
1950500	1952500	I didn't think I'd be too heavy for it.
1952500	1953500	I know.
1953500	1957500	When we mend it, why don't we make it strong enough for me and Mama to play on as well?
1957500	1959500	I think she'd like that.
1959500	1961500	That's a good idea, Papa.
1961500	1963500	But we want to use it, too.
1964500	1966500	Well, that's a cool idea.
1966500	1968500	I'll just try it out, now and again.
1977500	1980500	I want you to stay here while I'm out.
1980500	1982500	What if somebody asks us to play?
1982500	1984500	What do you mean, play?
1986500	1989500	I hope you're not thinking of the Moomin, are you?
1989500	1994500	I don't want you mixing with those noisy children ever again, do you hear me?
1994500	1996500	Where are you going, mother?
1996500	1998500	To look for another house.
1998500	2001500	It was a terrible mistake coming to Moomin Valley.
2010500	2013500	Look, there's Mrs. Philly drunk.
2013500	2015500	Good afternoon.
2015500	2017500	Please stay away from my children.
2017500	2018500	But why?
2018500	2021500	We thought they might like to come and have an adventure with us.
2023500	2024500	Oh, never mind.
2024500	2025500	Let's go.
2033500	2035500	Hey, hang on a minute.
2048500	2050500	Oh, you're Tarzan.
2063500	2065500	I can't take it.
2065500	2067500	It's too late for you now, Sniff.
2067500	2071500	Oh, no, not the hungry crocodile at the bottom of the porch.
2071500	2074500	We should have brought the Philly Junks with us.
2074500	2076500	But Moomin missed his Philly Junks.
2076500	2078500	He's not told her.
2078500	2081500	Have you been killed and eaten yet, Sniff?
2081500	2087500	No, I fell on top of the crocodile and knocked him out and then swam me shore.
2087500	2090500	Sniff, but I thought you couldn't swim.
2090500	2093500	On your own business.
2093500	2096500	Hey, that looks like the Philly Junks.
2101500	2103500	Why don't they come over here?
2103500	2106500	I bet their mother told them not to talk to us.
2106500	2108500	See if I care you.
2118500	2120500	Hey, what are you doing?
2120500	2123500	Why aren't you playing with Moomin and the others?
2123500	2125500	I don't think they want to play with us.
2125500	2128500	They didn't call for us when they weren't past.
2128500	2132500	Stinky's arrived and wonder what he's doing here.
2132500	2135500	I bet you it's no fun stuck in that garden.
2135500	2138500	No, we'd rather be out here playing.
2138500	2141500	Well, I know somewhere much better than Moomin's.
2141500	2143500	It's a great place to play.
2143500	2144500	Do you?
2144500	2145500	Yes, would I lie to you?
2145500	2148500	It's a bit of a way off, but it'll be really exciting and lots of fun.
2148500	2150500	So do you want to come or not?
2150500	2152500	Well, it is a bit boring here.
2152500	2154500	Yes, very.
2154500	2157500	Do you really think they don't want to play with us?
2157500	2159500	Doesn't it look like it?
2159500	2161500	There's absolutely right.
2161500	2163500	So come on if you're coming because I can't wait.
2163500	2165500	What stinky up to?
2165500	2167500	I don't trust him.
2182500	2185500	Okay, now this is the place I told you about.
2185500	2186500	Good, isn't it?
2186500	2191500	Now, if you hang on to that rope, you can swing over to the other side and back again.
2191500	2194500	Don't worry, it's quite safe.
2194500	2196500	That's great.
2196500	2199500	I've never been anywhere like this.
2199500	2201500	A bit frightening.
2201500	2204500	Without the thrill, where's the fun?
2204500	2207500	You need a bit of danger to spice it up.
2207500	2211500	Gee, Willikers, it looks like the other side is harder than this side.
2211500	2213500	Yes, I bet it's all right.
2213500	2215500	You just have to put your legs up, that's all.
2215500	2217500	Who wants to go first?
2217500	2221500	I've got it. Why don't you all go together?
2221500	2223500	What? The three of us?
2223500	2226500	See, this way you won't feel so scared, Willik.
2226500	2228500	No, not together.
2228500	2231500	Well, why don't you go one at a time then?
2231500	2234500	That way it's always more fun.
2234500	2236500	Can you do it, stinky?
2236500	2238500	Don't be silly. Of course I can.
2238500	2239500	I do it all the time.
2239500	2241500	One of the things I'm best at.
2241500	2243500	Even if I do say so myself.
2243500	2246500	So, why don't you show us, stinky?
2246500	2248500	Moonman!
2248500	2250500	I didn't know you were such a robespringer, stinky.
2250500	2253500	I'm sure he didn't either.
2253500	2257500	So, this is your usual place, is it?
2257500	2259500	Well, sort of.
2259500	2260500	You know something?
2260500	2263500	If you hadn't said that you'd done this lots of times,
2263500	2266500	I wouldn't have believed that I could have done it myself.
2266500	2269500	Come on, stinky. Show us how you do it.
2269500	2272500	If you go first, I'll be second.
2273500	2275500	No, it's all right. You can go first, moment.
2275500	2277500	Hello, I want to see how it's done.
2277500	2280500	Then throw me the rope, and I'll follow.
2280500	2282500	Now, tell the truth.
2282500	2284500	You've never done it. Have you, stinky?
2284500	2287500	Of course I've done it, stupid.
2287500	2289500	Now, come on. Come on.
2289500	2291500	Don't be such a spoiled sport.
2291500	2293500	We're all here waiting to cheer you on.
2293500	2295500	All right, everybody.
2295500	2298500	I give you the brave and bold Tarzan, stinky.
2298500	2299500	Are you watching?
2299500	2301500	Are you ready, stinky?
2301500	2303500	A big cheer, everyone.
2303500	2305500	Waiting for you.
2305500	2308500	Oh, stinky, my big brave hero, jump.
2308500	2311500	Well, go on. We're all waiting for you, stinky.
2311500	2313500	Come on, stinky. Show us how it's done.
2313500	2314500	Come on, stinky.
2314500	2315500	Come on, stinky.
2315500	2316500	Come on, stinky.
2316500	2317500	Come on, stinky.
2322500	2325500	Ah!
2326500	2329500	Oh, so this is how you've done it lots of times before, is it?
2329500	2331500	Yes, the rope must have shrunk.
2331500	2332500	Oh!
2332500	2334500	He was trying to fool you.
2334500	2338500	It was a dangerous game, and he knew very well it couldn't be done.
2338500	2340500	I did it!
2340500	2343500	Now, why don't you come with us and play properly?
2343500	2346500	You're gonna be Tarzan as long as you like.
2346500	2348500	And we're all here.
2348500	2350500	Oh, you're gonna be fine.
2350500	2353500	Now, why don't you come with us and play properly?
2353500	2355500	You're gonna be Tarzan as long as you like.
2355500	2357500	And when you get tired, just let go of the rope.
2357500	2358500	All right, stinky.
2358500	2360500	Come on, stinky.
2360500	2361500	Yeah!
2361500	2364500	You can't just leave me here, you fox.
2364500	2365500	Ah!
2365500	2367500	It isn't fair, please.
2367500	2368500	Help!
2368500	2371500	Don't leave me here.
2375500	2378500	Woo!
2379500	2382500	Woo!
2382500	2383500	Yeah!
2383500	2388500	But stinky was left on his own to decide whether to climb up the rope or drop into the river.
2388500	2391500	And the filajong children had more fun than they'd ever had before,
2391500	2394500	but they didn't get home until very late in the evening.
2394500	2397500	Bye, we'll see you tomorrow.
2397500	2398500	Okay, mommy.
2398500	2399500	Bye, momen.
2399500	2400500	Bye-bye.
2400500	2401500	Bye-bye.
2404500	2407500	Oh, my dear children, I told you to stay at home!
2407500	2410500	What earth have you been? Where have you been?
2410500	2412500	With movement of the others.
2412500	2414500	They kidnapped you, did they?
2414500	2416500	No, we've been playing with them.
2416500	2421500	Well, you can just forget about the movements we're moving out as soon as we possibly can.
2421500	2422500	Moving, mother?
2422500	2428500	Yes, right away from this valley, this is no place for a spotless and well-ordered home.
2428500	2431500	What's the matter?
2431500	2433500	No, we don't want to move.
2433500	2434500	Ah!
2434500	2436500	We want to stay, mother.
2437500	2439500	Oh!
2439500	2441500	Movement house is nice and dusty.
2441500	2443500	We want to stay in the movement valley forever.
2443500	2446500	Oh, please, mother, we love it here.
2446500	2449500	Oh, after all I've done for you children.
2449500	2454500	And my experience children usually get what they want.
2466500	2481500	And that was how Phila John and her three children became permanent residents.
2481500	2499500	And that was how Phila John and her three children became permanent residents of movement valley.
2499500	2506500	They loved the laughter and they loved the living the movements.
2506500	2513500	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
2513500	2517500	They're always happy and always at play.
2517500	2521500	The movements are having fun day after day.
2521500	2524500	The movements.
2524500	2528500	The movements.
2528500	2535500	They loved the laughter and they loved the living the movements.
2535500	2542500	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
2542500	2546500	They're always happy and always at play.
2546500	2550500	The movements are having fun day after day.
2550500	2553500	The movements.
2553500	2557500	The movements.
2557500	2564500	The movements.
2587500	2594500	The movements.
2594500	2599500	The movements.
2599500	2603500	The movements.
2603500	2609500	The movements.
2609500	2614500	The movements.
2614500	2621500	There were the movements.
2621500	2628500	There were the movements.
2628500	2635500	The movements.
2635500	2640500	The movements.
2640500	2646500	The movements.
2646500	2652500	The movements.
2652500	2659500	The movements.
2659500	2666500	The movements.
2666500	2678500	For a whole week, snort maiden had been curled up on the sofa, reading fairy tales.
2678500	2690500	It's a lovely day and at last movement is persuaded to come out for a walk in the lonely mountains.
2690500	2696500	It's beautiful up here, aren't you glad you came now?
2696500	2701500	This is much better than fairy tales, isn't it snort maiden?
2701500	2708500	Oh look, moment, it's Adelweis.
2708500	2712500	No, it isn't. That doesn't grow here at all.
2712500	2715500	I'm sure it is. I know what it looks like.
2715500	2718500	I'm sorry, but it's not.
2718500	2721500	Oh, it's just like in Heidi.
2721500	2723500	No, it's not. It's just a daisy.
2723500	2726500	Oh, come on. I want to pick it.
2726500	2728500	Oh, no, it's too dangerous.
2728500	2733500	I know then. You can do it. You're my boyfriend, aren't you, Moomin?
2733500	2737500	Well, I suppose we could climb down there, but I promise you it's not Adelweis.
2737500	2741500	That only grows in the Alps and there are hundreds of miles away.
2741500	2747500	I know it's Adelweis.
2747500	2751500	Be careful. They don't care about danger in fairy tales.
2751500	2756500	That's why they call them fairy tales, silly.
2759500	2763500	Fairy Princess, please accept this, my humble offering.
2763500	2767500	Thank you, Brave Knight. You were right, Moomin. This isn't Adelweis.
2767500	2772500	See, I told you, it's going to be hard to get down from here, you know?
2772500	2775500	Can't we go back the way we came?
2775500	2779500	Well, I think it'll be easier to try to get to that path.
2779500	2782500	If you say so.
2783500	2787500	It's nearer anyway, and better than going up.
2787500	2791500	I'm surprised you're such a good climber.
2791500	2795500	Oh, Royalty is good at practically everything.
2795500	2799500	Oh, it's not made of.
2799500	2809500	It's not made of.
2809500	2816500	It's not made of.
2816500	2822500	It's not made of.
2822500	2829500	Let me see six pebbles.
2829500	2834500	What was that, a giant snowball? It can't be, it isn't winter.
2834500	2840500	Well, nothing of interest to me. Now, where was I?
2840500	2844500	We start hemulating. Has Snork Maiden just gone past you?
2844500	2848500	Snork Maiden. No, all I've seen going past is a very large snowball.
2848500	2850500	That was Snork Maiden.
2850500	2854500	But she's not made of snow.
2854500	2860500	Stop! Snork Maiden, stop!
2861500	2866500	Snork Maiden!
2866500	2870500	Snork Maiden!
2870500	2883500	Oh, I'll praise the boob all she's still breathing. She's just knocked herself out.
2884500	2890500	Oh, Mom, what's happened to her?
2890500	2892500	She's unconscious.
2892500	2894500	Oh, what are you trying to do?
2894500	2897500	I want to get her home to Mama.
2897500	2900500	Oh, difficult. She should lose a bit of weight.
2900500	2905500	Perhaps she'd come around if we splashed cold water on her face.
2905500	2909500	Oh, there's nothing to fetch it in.
2909500	2914500	Ah, if you cut some bark off a tree trunk, you could make a small container.
2914500	2918500	What a good idea. If you stay here, I'll go and do that.
2921500	2924500	Wake up, Snork Maiden.
2924500	2937500	Oh, that's cold.
2937500	2947500	Has she come around yet, Mr. Himulet?
2947500	2948500	No.
2948500	2952500	Okay.
2953500	2955500	Oh, good. It's working.
2955500	2958500	How are you feeling, Snork Maiden?
2958500	2961500	Are you all right, Snork Maiden?
2961500	2963500	Where am I?
2963500	2966500	We're still up in Lonely Mountains.
2966500	2968500	Who am I?
2968500	2973500	Why Royal Highness the Princess of Lonely Mountains?
2973500	2975500	What? A Princess?
2975500	2979500	Oh, yes, of course.
2979500	2980500	And who are you?
2980500	2983500	I am the Prince of Lonely Mountains.
2983500	2984500	Oh, yeah.
2984500	2985500	Oh, yeah.
2985500	2987500	With that ridiculous shape?
2987500	2988500	No.
2988500	2990500	A gesture, perhaps.
2990500	2992500	You want?
2992500	2993500	You there.
2993500	2996500	Do not laugh.
3004500	3007500	I think the poor girl must have lost her memory.
3007500	3010500	Of course not. She's just pretending.
3010500	3014500	One does not whisper with royalty present.
3014500	3015500	Do you hear?
3015500	3020500	So sorry, Royal Highness.
3020500	3023500	A poor crafters cabin.
3023500	3025500	This is your castle, ma'am.
3025500	3027500	Royalty doesn't live in shacks.
3027500	3029500	Snork Maiden.
3029500	3031500	Stop calling us that.
3031500	3033500	It's very rude.
3033500	3035500	Oh, forgive me.
3035500	3038500	Our royal castle is elsewhere.
3038500	3039500	Is it not?
3039500	3040500	What?
3040500	3042500	That must be hunting lodge.
3042500	3044500	No, of course that's what it is.
3044500	3047500	Good. We accept that.
3055500	3059500	Are you two going to tell me what you're so busy looking at?
3059500	3068500	Send a maid to my room, my good man.
3068500	3071500	A maid?
3071500	3075500	My good man.
3079500	3082500	Papa, have you seen Snork Maiden?
3082500	3085500	Yes, up there.
3086500	3091500	Mama, please would you go on have a word with Snork Maiden?
3091500	3093500	Have you been quarreling?
3093500	3094500	Oh, no.
3094500	3096500	It's just that she fell and banged her head.
3096500	3099500	And now she thinks she's a royal princess.
3099500	3102500	What?
3108500	3111500	Ah, Nanette! Come here, please.
3111500	3112500	Nanette?
3112500	3114500	I'm Boomin, Mama.
3114500	3117500	Oh, we're too weary for your foolish jokes, girl.
3117500	3121500	Oh, we are very tired indeed, Nanette.
3121500	3125500	Please bring our silk nighty with the hand embroidered swans and clowns.
3125500	3128500	Then you may go.
3132500	3133500	I wish you, Mama.
3133500	3135500	All right, I'm sure.
3135500	3137500	But she seems convinced she's a princess.
3137500	3140500	Sounds as if it's dangerous, doesn't it, Mama?
3140500	3141500	Oh, I don't think so.
3141500	3144500	I was only joking when I called her a princess.
3144500	3147500	I'm very glad you didn't call her an opera singer.
3147500	3149500	Is Snork Maiden asleep now?
3149500	3150500	Oh, yes.
3150500	3153500	In a night gown with crowns and swans embroidered on it.
3153500	3156500	And another thing, Boomin, she wants a canopy put up immediately.
3156500	3158500	What's that?
3158500	3163500	Oh, a fancy cover over the bed that's draped in silks, envelopes, and tassels.
3163500	3167500	Oh, she was very upset because there wasn't one there already.
3167500	3169500	It might not be necessary.
3169500	3171500	Her memory could have come back by the time she wakes up.
3171500	3173500	Why don't we wait and see?
3173500	3175500	She might be fine after a rest.
3175500	3177500	I sure hope so.
3177500	3180500	But what do we do if it hasn't come back?
3180500	3182500	Let's think about that if it happens.
3182500	3184500	We might not have to build that canopy.
3184500	3186500	Let me try it.
3186500	3187500	Try what?
3187500	3189500	To get Snork Maiden's memory back, what else?
3189500	3190500	Oh, how?
3190500	3193500	Well, I think that if she sees me, she'll remember me
3193500	3195500	and then she'll remember everything else too.
3195500	3197500	Don't be silly little Maiden.
3197500	3200500	If she doesn't remember me, why should you remember you, eh?
3200500	3203500	Simple, because I'm unforgettable.
3203500	3205500	There is that, I suppose.
3211500	3213500	She's still fast asleep.
3213500	3215500	Well, I'm glad we made the canopy anyway.
3215500	3217500	It looks really great, doesn't it?
3219500	3222500	Oh, look, she's opening her eyes.
3223500	3225500	Are you awake?
3225500	3227500	Get up, Snork Maiden.
3227500	3228500	Come on.
3228500	3230500	Let's go down to the beach.
3230500	3232500	And who is that person?
3232500	3234500	Come on, you remember me.
3234500	3236500	I warn you if you don't, you'll be sorry.
3236500	3238500	Oh, quite amusing.
3238500	3240500	Ah, so you remember me now.
3240500	3242500	Of course we do.
3242500	3244500	There you are, I told you.
3244500	3245500	Who am I then?
3245500	3248500	Well, you're another court jester.
3248500	3249500	Of course.
3249500	3255500	Don't be little like a court jester.
3255500	3259500	Oh, very funny.
3259500	3261500	She's a better clown than the other one.
3261500	3263500	You can perform at our wedding.
3263500	3265500	You're a wedding.
3270500	3273500	Hey, hey, hey, boy.
3273500	3277500	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
3278500	3280500	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
3280500	3282500	There you are.
3287500	3288500	Hi, stinky.
3288500	3290500	What are you doing here?
3290500	3292500	A moment asked me to come over to a moment house
3292500	3295500	and propose to some princess.
3295500	3297500	Moments lost his marbles as well then.
3297500	3299500	I think he wanted stinky as a contrast.
3299500	3301500	You what?
3301500	3303500	You mean to tell me you're both my rivals
3303500	3305500	for the hands of the royal princess?
3305500	3307500	Well, it's not very original.
3307500	3309500	But in order to win the princess
3309500	3311500	and have her kingdom stinky,
3311500	3313500	you'll need to solve three riddles.
3313500	3314500	Hey, that's great.
3314500	3317500	What's this kingdom like?
3317500	3319500	All right, sooner number one,
3319500	3320500	you may now enter.
3320500	3322500	Oh, that's me.
3332500	3333500	Oh!
3335500	3337500	Oh, hi, princess.
3337500	3339500	How are you doing?
3339500	3341500	Jester, is this man a suitor?
3341500	3343500	He is.
3343500	3345500	I fear he does not treat us with respect.
3345500	3347500	Forgive him, your highness.
3347500	3349500	He is from a foreign land.
3349500	3353500	And does not know the ways of your kingdom.
3353500	3354500	Hmm.
3354500	3356500	Well, all right.
3356500	3357500	Very well.
3357500	3358500	Here is the first riddle.
3358500	3360500	Are you ready?
3360500	3361500	Are you away?
3361500	3362500	Now then, listen.
3362500	3364500	What is it that is yellow?
3364500	3366500	Has four legs and sings.
3366500	3367500	Oh, dear.
3367500	3369500	An unusual canary?
3369500	3371500	With four legs, you nincompoop.
3371500	3374500	I don't know any birds with four legs.
3374500	3376500	Who said it was a bird?
3376500	3377500	All right, then.
3377500	3379500	What's the answer, snark baby?
3379500	3381500	He shows no respect.
3381500	3384500	Throw him into a dungeon and give him no food.
3384500	3386500	Your highness, he is temporarily out of his mind
3386500	3388500	after a long journey here.
3388500	3389500	Hang on.
3389500	3390500	I'm not out of my mind.
3390500	3391500	Shut up, kid.
3391500	3392500	That's what's the answer.
3392500	3394500	That's what I want to know.
3394500	3397500	Silence, it does not concern you.
3397500	3399500	We believe you to be of lowly birth.
3405500	3407500	Sorry about this, napkin.
3407500	3408500	Don't worry.
3411500	3412500	Hmm.
3412500	3413500	No, sir.
3413500	3414500	Galad, but not bad.
3414500	3417500	I am honored to be here, your royal highness.
3417500	3418500	He'll do.
3418500	3420500	An easy riddle to start.
3420500	3421500	Here it is.
3421500	3425500	First, what is the number of which we think?
3425500	3426500	Take your time.
3426500	3427500	Two?
3427500	3430500	For a faux-galat night, that is correct.
3430500	3431500	Now, listen.
3431500	3433500	What is the word upon our mind?
3433500	3434500	Love.
3434500	3435500	That's amazing.
3435500	3438500	Truly, the suitor has brains as well as looks.
3438500	3439500	Question three.
3439500	3441500	There are two numbers on our mind.
3441500	3442500	What do they add up to?
3442500	3444500	Answer carefully for it.
3444500	3446500	Could unlock your princess's heart.
3446500	3447500	21.
3448500	3449500	Oh.
3449500	3451500	Was that right, too?
3451500	3452500	Oh, no.
3452500	3453500	It was 22.
3459500	3461500	My heart is heavy.
3461500	3464500	For chance, we should have said it was correct.
3464500	3465500	He was rather cute.
3465500	3467500	Was he not just her?
3467500	3469500	It's your turn now, stinky.
3469500	3472500	Well, I suppose that even half of Snortiles
3472500	3473500	would be something.
3474500	3477500	Think she'll ever get her memory back?
3477500	3479500	Of course she will.
3479500	3481500	This is not our idea of a suitor.
3481500	3485500	His heart is aching for you, royal highness.
3485500	3487500	Ah, let it ache.
3487500	3488500	Oh, alright.
3488500	3489500	I'll give him a chance.
3489500	3491500	Here is a question number one.
3491500	3493500	What is the number we are thinking of?
3493500	3495500	Well, of all our stupid questions.
3495500	3497500	We haven't all day.
3497500	3499500	Oh, well, oh.
3501500	3502500	For.
3502500	3503500	Indeed not.
3503500	3507500	It is 3,598,765.
3507500	3509500	Begone out.
3509500	3511500	Please, Snortiles, let's up there.
3511500	3513500	What room is up with his hands?
3513500	3515500	It's not fair, right?
3515500	3516500	Go home.
3516500	3519500	I'll give you another one I want after.
3519500	3521500	Oh, what a rude suitor.
3521500	3524500	We are no longer in the mood for royal marriage, jester.
3524500	3526500	At least not today.
3526500	3527500	A wise decision.
3527500	3530500	Oh, princess of the lonely mountains.
3530500	3532500	They will be prostrated with grief,
3532500	3534500	but bid the other suitors to go home.
3534500	3535500	Do not let them beg.
3535500	3537500	We would not like that.
3537500	3539500	Very well, your royal highness.
3539500	3540500	Do it kindly.
3540500	3541500	We wish them no pain at all.
3541500	3543500	From this day on, we shall devote ourselves
3543500	3546500	to good works and to the well-being of our people.
3546500	3548500	Oh.
3548500	3551500	You, I didn't want to marry you anyway.
3551500	3553500	Wonder what Snort-Mayton's up to now?
3553500	3555500	Upstairs thinking.
3555500	3558500	She says she'll devote her life to good works.
3558500	3561500	Works, what works?
3561500	3563500	I don't know, but she probably wants to be remembered
3563500	3565500	in the history books.
3565500	3569500	The princess who was adored by her subjects.
3569500	3572500	Oh, she's coming down.
3575500	3576500	Your royal highness.
3576500	3578500	May I assist you?
3578500	3580500	Send the net to us.
3580500	3582500	She is on an errand, your highness.
3582500	3584500	Then have someone else make soup?
3584500	3586500	Nursing, but not too rich.
3586500	3588500	Soup, highness?
3588500	3589500	Yes, indeed.
3589500	3593500	And then we shall take it to our poor subjects ourselves.
3593500	3595500	What kind of soup?
3595500	3596500	We don't know.
3596500	3597500	We eat.
3597500	3598500	We don't cook.
3598500	3600500	The poor will be happy with anything brought
3600500	3602500	by the princess herself.
3602500	3603500	Now hurry, man.
3603500	3605500	Be quick about it.
3607500	3610500	No, she wants some soup.
3611500	3613500	This will be ample.
3613500	3615500	The poor do not eat much.
3615500	3617500	It would only make the meal.
3617500	3620500	I don't know anyone poor around here, your majesty.
3620500	3622500	Nonsense.
3625500	3629500	One, two, one, two, one.
3630500	3632500	Greetings, jester.
3632500	3633500	What now?
3633500	3635500	We're taking soup to the poor.
3635500	3637500	Made with our own regal fingers.
3637500	3639500	Do you know where they are, jester?
3639500	3640500	Your fingers?
3640500	3641500	Oh, I know.
3641500	3642500	Good.
3642500	3643500	Wonderful.
3643500	3644500	Take us to them now.
3644500	3646500	They will be so grateful.
3646500	3648500	You bet, princess.
3660500	3662500	That house there.
3662500	3664500	Oh, yes.
3664500	3668500	It's nice to know that the poor and my kingdom are so well off.
3680500	3683500	Oh, you, please come over here.
3683500	3684500	Hmm?
3684500	3685500	Will you?
3685500	3688500	I'm the princess of Lonely Mountain.
3689500	3691500	Princess?
3691500	3694500	Oh, what moment you're all highness.
3694500	3696500	Do not keep us waiting.
3696500	3698500	We have a lot to do.
3698500	3699500	I'm coming.
3699500	3700500	I'm coming.
3700500	3702500	Forgive me, you're all highness.
3702500	3705500	I had no idea you were...
3705500	3707500	My, my, smart maiden.
3707500	3709500	That common name again?
3709500	3710500	We are princess.
3710500	3711500	Handle sticks.
3711500	3714500	You're not right in the head coming here bothering your elders
3714500	3715500	and betters like this.
3715500	3716500	My betters?
3716500	3718500	Oh, are you the queen then?
3718500	3719500	Hmm?
3719500	3721500	I am Mrs. Philly jog.
3721500	3722500	Now what do you want?
3722500	3725500	You're just fulfilling our royal duty bringing soup to the poor.
3725500	3728500	Giving cheer to those less fortunate that ourselves.
3728500	3729500	Here my good woman.
3729500	3731500	Now if you just...
3731500	3733500	Oh, there you call me poor.
3733500	3736500	You who doesn't have a stitch of clothing to your name.
3736500	3740500	Oh, the rich aroma of the soup must have overcome you, Mrs. Philly jog.
3740500	3741500	Ah!
3741500	3744500	Eat it yourself, your majesty.
3744500	3746500	Ah!
3746500	3748500	This is how I treason.
3748500	3749500	Send for the guard.
3749500	3751500	Take her to the tower.
3751500	3753500	Hahaha!
3753500	3754500	Oh!
3754500	3755500	Oh!
3755500	3757500	We cannot see.
3757500	3760500	I'm afraid that serves you right, Snork maiden.
3760500	3762500	Snork maiden!
3762500	3764500	Don't use that common name.
3764500	3765500	Help us.
3765500	3766500	We cannot see.
3766500	3767500	Please don't steal.
3767500	3768500	You're all highness.
3768500	3769500	Oh, hold a moment.
3769500	3771500	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
3771500	3773500	I think it's stuck moment.
3773500	3774500	Use the handle.
3774500	3775500	Ah!
3775500	3776500	Stop!
3776500	3777500	You're hurting me.
3777500	3778500	I'll get it on.
3778500	3779500	Out of the way.
3779500	3780500	Ah!
3780500	3781500	Wait a minute.
3781500	3783500	You can't break that soup, Turin.
3783500	3785500	It's a family heirloom.
3785500	3787500	And you mustn't hit Snork maiden on the head.
3787500	3788500	You might hurt her.
3788500	3791500	Stop fooling around and get this thing off, will you?
3791500	3792500	All right.
3796500	3798500	Oh, poor Snork maiden.
3798500	3800500	You didn't have to get up that hard.
3800500	3802500	Difficult to judge it with a broom.
3802500	3804500	You never hit anyone wearing a scepter in before.
3804500	3806500	Oh, you will write your royal highness.
3806500	3808500	Oh, forgive us, your royal highness.
3808500	3811500	Sprinkle some cold water over her face.
3811500	3813500	No, she'd hate that, mama.
3813500	3815500	Snork maiden.
3815500	3817500	Oh, it's no good, moment.
3817500	3820500	I don't think she'll wake up to anything, but your royal highness.
3820500	3821500	Your highness.
3821500	3822500	Your highness.
3822500	3823500	Come out!
3826500	3828500	Snork maiden.
3828500	3831500	Oh, I'm so glad your royal highness is with us again.
3831500	3834500	I hope your royal highness is not badly hurt.
3834500	3835500	Oh.
3837500	3838500	Where am I?
3838500	3841500	In moment, Valley, of course, stupid. Where do you think?
3841500	3843500	That's weird.
3843500	3846500	I thought moment and I had gone for a walk in the lonely mountains.
3846500	3848500	Didn't we, moment?
3848500	3849500	Huh?
3849500	3851500	Do you remember who I am, Snork maiden?
3851500	3854500	Moment, what are you talking about, of course I do.
3854500	3856500	And you don't think you're a princess anymore?
3856500	3857500	Princess?
3857500	3859500	Have you gone crazy or something?
3859500	3860500	Or what princess?
3860500	3861500	What do you mean, moment?
3861500	3862500	Hooray!
3862500	3863500	She's back to normal.
3863500	3865500	Snork maiden's back to normal.
3865500	3867500	Yes, it's nice to have you back again.
3867500	3869500	Yes, it's wonderful.
3869500	3871500	Welcome home.
3871500	3872500	What is?
3872500	3873500	What's wonderful?
3873500	3875500	Have you all gone loopy or something?
3875500	3877500	Never mind, Snork maiden.
3877500	3880500	You bumped your head, that's all.
3880500	3884500	And so Snork maiden's brief spell as a royal princess came to an end.
3884500	3887500	Except that she was the only one who didn't remember it.
3887500	3890500	But everyone else in movement valley breathed a sigh of relief.
3896500	3902500	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
3902500	3910500	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
3910500	3914500	They're always happy and always at play.
3914500	3921500	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
3921500	3925500	The movements.
3925500	3932500	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
3932500	3940500	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
3940500	3943500	They're always happy and always at play.
3943500	3950500	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
3950500	3954500	The movements.
3954500	3960500	The movements.
3970500	3982500	Here they are for one and all.
3982500	3985500	The movements are about to come.
3985500	3988500	Come on and sit down here with me.
3988500	3991500	They're for you on your TV.
3991500	3994500	They are the movements.
3994500	3997500	They are the movements.
3997500	4000500	Come with me, give me your hand.
4000500	4003500	I'll take you up to a movement land.
4003500	4006500	You can fly just like a bird.
4006500	4008500	Sing that song ever.
4008500	4011500	There were the movements.
4011500	4014500	There were the movements.
4014500	4017500	There were the movements.
4017500	4020500	There were the movements.
4020500	4023500	There were the movements.
4023500	4026500	There were the movements.
4026500	4029500	There were the movements.
4029500	4032500	There were the movements.
4032500	4035500	There were the movements.
4035500	4038500	There were the movements.
4038500	4041500	There were the movements.
4041500	4044500	There were the movements.
4044500	4048500	There were the movements.
4048500	4052500	There were the movements.
4052500	4058500	There were the movements.
4058500	4061500	There were the movements.
4061500	4066500	There were the movements.
4066500	4076500	With all the planets in outer space, there must be other forms of life different to that on Earth.
4076500	4081500	We don't know what they look like because no one from here has ever seen them.
4081500	4093500	However, we do know that they don't look like this because this is sniffed one of movement's friends.
4111500	4114500	There were the movements.
4120500	4124500	There were the movements.
4126500	4131500	There were the movements.
4133500	4140500	So, it looks as though the rumor was right.
4140500	4143500	Oh, what room was that?
4143500	4147500	That we were about to be invaded by aliens from outer space.
4147500	4150500	Oh, dear, do you mean that thing that was chasing me
4150500	4152500	might have been one of them?
4152500	4153500	Well, yes.
4153500	4156500	I thought they were just after me.
4156500	4159500	I wouldn't have thought you'd have been that important to them, sniff,
4159500	4162500	but I suppose you never know, do you?
4163500	4166500	It says here in this book that aliens from outer space
4166500	4171500	are very civilized and peace-loving and would never want to invade us.
4171500	4174500	It seemed as though they're quite happy where they are.
4174500	4177500	I do, it's not a very scientific book.
4177500	4181500	Well, it was definitely attacking me, Mom and Papa, I know it was.
4181500	4185500	Well, it might have been a civilization from another planet, sniff.
4185500	4187500	They were just hungry.
4187500	4188500	Huh?
4188500	4193500	Well, the inspector told me that he thought we were being invaded by aliens, and he shouldn't know.
4193500	4195500	I'm sure he's exaggerating.
4195500	4197500	I wonder what they look like.
4197500	4200500	Why don't you come and help me in the garden?
4200500	4202500	You never know, we might see one.
4209500	4211500	Mama, wait for me!
4217500	4219500	Mama, what's that?
4219500	4222500	Well, I would say it's not a vegetable, that's for sure.
4222500	4225500	It looks like a flying saucer.
4225500	4228500	I wonder if there are any aliens in it.
4228500	4230500	They might be heard, Mama.
4230500	4232500	Let's have a look.
4243500	4246500	I think there's something there.
4248500	4250500	This looks odd.
4250500	4252500	I wonder what it is.
4252500	4254500	It's a bit like a radio, isn't it?
4254500	4256500	Oh yeah, an alien radio.
4256500	4259500	Do you think there's anyone in there moving?
4261500	4263500	Anybody there?
4264500	4267500	It seems to have been deserted.
4267500	4270500	There's a funny noise coming from it.
4270500	4273500	Well, it doesn't look to me like it could fly again.
4273500	4275500	It could be repaired.
4275500	4277500	You'd need to know about flying saucers.
4277500	4279500	Papa could do it?
4281500	4285500	I don't think flying saucers should make that sort of noise.
4285500	4287500	Do you, woman?
4287500	4290500	I don't think so, but I don't know very much about them.
4290500	4293500	It does seem a bit odd, as if they've said it to be blown up
4293500	4295500	so that no one would be able to steal it,
4295500	4297500	because they want to keep the design a secret.
4297500	4299500	Do you think it will?
4299500	4301500	Oh!
4301500	4305500	I'm not sure, Mama, but let's get away in case it does explode.
4305500	4309500	That's why it's empty, but I wish it hadn't landed in the Asparagus patch.
4309500	4311500	I'll take the radio with me.
4318500	4320500	It won't be too long now, Mama.
4320500	4322500	No, it won't.
4323500	4325500	Good morning.
4327500	4328500	It's vanished.
4328500	4330500	Less my soul.
4330500	4333500	Papa's book said they could be a very advanced life form.
4340500	4344500	There's nothing to show it was ever here,
4344500	4348500	except the hole in the ground, and this radio thing.
4351500	4353500	Hmm.
4353500	4355500	Me, is it a radio, Papa?
4355500	4358500	I don't know. It looks a bit like one.
4358500	4361500	Let's try pressing one of these buttons.
4361500	4364500	The red one first, I think.
4370500	4372500	Oh!
4379500	4381500	Papa, where have you gone?
4381500	4383500	Well, I'm right here.
4383500	4386500	No, I wonder what happens if I press this one.
4386500	4390500	Well, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't see you either, dear.
4390500	4392500	What?
4394500	4397500	Oh, I see.
4399500	4402500	So if you press the red button, you become invisible.
4402500	4404500	What a fascinating machine.
4404500	4406500	Papa, I think I'd rather see you, dear.
4406500	4408500	Well, of course you would.
4408500	4412500	Well, then let's try the yellow one.
4412500	4414500	Can you see me now?
4414500	4416500	No, Papa.
4416500	4417500	Oh, that's odd.
4417500	4418500	Do you want me to try, Papa?
4418500	4420500	Please, Mama.
4420500	4422500	There, that's it.
4430500	4432500	Oh, Papa.
4432500	4434500	Oh, that's a very dangerous machine.
4434500	4436500	I don't want to disappear ever again.
4436500	4438500	It's not a nice experience.
4438500	4441500	No, dear. I didn't like you vanishing like that.
4441500	4443500	Well, we must put it somewhere safe, Mama,
4443500	4445500	where the children can't find it.
4445500	4447500	Yes, dear.
4453500	4454500	Mom!
4454500	4456500	Snorke made it. What an earth's the matter.
4456500	4458500	We found a strange creature.
4458500	4460500	Strange creature?
4460500	4461500	I think it's an alien.
4461500	4463500	Does it look like a jellyfish?
4463500	4465500	No, not at all.
4465500	4467500	Little mice keeping an eye on it.
4467500	4469500	Come on.
4474500	4476500	Where are you going, Mum and Papa?
4476500	4478500	Going me. Oh, no, Especial.
4478500	4479500	Mum and Mama, hang on.
4479500	4482500	I've got a few questions for you.
4482500	4485500	Really, Inspector?
4486500	4488500	I was told that a flying saucer
4488500	4490500	had landed in your garden,
4490500	4492500	but all I can see is a big hole.
4492500	4493500	Where is it?
4493500	4495500	What have you done with the saucer?
4495500	4496500	Nothing.
4496500	4497500	Well, where is it?
4497500	4499500	It's not there now.
4499500	4502500	It was there, but then it just vanished.
4502500	4503500	Vanished?
4503500	4505500	Yes, that's right.
4505500	4508500	When you say vanished, you mean it flew away again?
4508500	4510500	No, it just went woof.
4510500	4511500	Gone.
4511500	4513500	Moments are it, too.
4513500	4514500	That's very odd.
4514500	4516500	Yes, it was.
4516500	4519500	Did you see any aliens on board by any chance?
4519500	4520500	No.
4520500	4522500	Are you telling me the truth?
4522500	4523500	Of course.
4523500	4525500	Why should I lie to you?
4525500	4526500	Well, I can't.
4526500	4528500	Think of any reason.
4528500	4530500	I'm sorry, but it's upsetting
4530500	4532500	aliens invading Mum and Valley.
4532500	4534500	Yes, it is. Can we go now?
4534500	4536500	Certainly.
4536500	4539500	Where are you all going, by the way?
4539500	4542500	Oh, only to the beach to collect shells.
4542500	4544500	See you, Inspector.
4544500	4547500	Collecting shells indeed,
4547500	4550500	while I'm hunting for aliens.
4550500	4553500	Ah! Over here!
4553500	4555500	Ah!
4555500	4556500	Ah!
4556500	4559500	Ah!
4559500	4562500	Ah, ah, you did the thing now.
4562500	4565500	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
4565500	4567500	Is that an alien?
4567500	4569500	It certainly is, but not like it says in the book.
4569500	4571500	Have you tried talking to it?
4571500	4573340	Yes, but it wouldn't answer.
4573340	4574860	Well, let me try.
4574860	4577980	Are you from outer space?
4577980	4578900	Go show Wattley.
4578900	4580900	Wattley, do I see Dachydachadali nodding?
4580900	4584980	Yes, it looks like a laugh and laugh a little bit.
4584980	4587780	It looks like an alien child to me.
4587780	4589020	More like a lamp.
4589020	4589900	Poor thing.
4589900	4591260	He must be hungry.
4591260	4592860	Let's take him home.
4592860	4595860	Yeah, well, we don't want the inspector to see him.
4601500	4621580	I'm sorry we can't understand you, but I'm sure you'll like milk, even if you don't
4621580	4622580	speak English.
4622580	4626580	Just try it and see.
4626580	4629620	I think he's missing his home.
4629620	4634140	Wherever in the universe that might be, I wonder where his parents are.
4634140	4635620	He can't have come on his own.
4635620	4637380	He seems far too little for that.
4637380	4638860	Well, I don't know.
4638860	4643060	But he's obviously missing them and he seems very unhappy.
4643060	4646660	Do you think the inspector would really arrest him, Owen Papa?
4646660	4647660	Possibly.
4647660	4649820	He would think it is duty.
4649820	4652140	Well that would be horrible of him.
4652140	4653140	I know.
4653140	4654140	It's inspector.
4654140	4660140	Oh dear, he mustn't find him here.
4660140	4664140	And he's got stinky with him.
4664140	4665140	Oh, stinky.
4665140	4666140	Well, that means trouble.
4666140	4667140	Quick, he can hide in the kitchen.
4667140	4668140	We got to do something.
4668140	4669140	And quickly.
4669140	4670140	I know what to do.
4670140	4671140	What, Mama?
4671140	4672140	We'll use the machine.
4672140	4673140	Oh yeah.
4673140	4674140	I know what to do.
4674140	4675140	I know what to do.
4675140	4676140	What, Mama?
4676140	4677140	We'll use the machine.
4677140	4678140	Oh yeah.
4678140	4679140	I know what to do.
4679140	4680140	I know what to do.
4680140	4681140	I know what to do.
4681140	4682140	I know what to do.
4683140	4692140	We'll just keep him outside.
4692140	4702140	Now him, this one, right?
4707140	4708140	Oh dear.
4708140	4711140	I think they're here!
4711140	4720140	Oh, moving papa, I heard there was an alien here with what's happening?
4724140	4726140	What's happened to me?
4726140	4728140	Goodness, Inspector, you're very shiny.
4728140	4731140	Oh dear, yes, how very, very strange.
4731140	4734140	You look like a great big glow worm.
4734140	4737140	An inspector in shining armor, you mean, Little My?
4737140	4739140	That's just what I thought.
4740140	4743140	You'll never need a lamp to be seen, Inspector.
4743140	4744140	I like it.
4744140	4746140	Criminals will be afraid of me.
4746140	4750140	I can't wait to get back to the station and show the constables.
4750140	4752140	Handy for reading in bed, too.
4752140	4755140	Well, duty calls. Bye!
4765140	4766140	What are you doing?
4766140	4768140	I didn't know that the machine was still working.
4768140	4770140	Oh, you can speak English.
4770140	4771140	Of course I can.
4771140	4774140	It's just that I need my language converted to help me to translate.
4774140	4776140	And if you hadn't taken it from my ship and hidden it,
4776140	4778140	I would have been able to talk sooner.
4778140	4781140	That's a good way to learn, isn't it?
4781140	4782140	Where are you going?
4782140	4784140	To see that nice shiny man.
4784140	4786140	But he'll arrest you!
4786140	4789140	He came here looking for you, but he forgot about it
4789140	4791140	when the machine started him glowing.
4793140	4795140	No! Don't go there!
4796140	4797140	Hey, why?
4797140	4799140	I love that light of shimmer.
4799140	4803140	It's just like, oh, it makes me feel really safe.
4804140	4806140	Hello! Hello, Inspector.
4806140	4807140	Yes, what is it?
4807140	4809140	Take me with you.
4809140	4810140	What?
4810140	4813140	Well, you're so bright and beautiful Inspector.
4813140	4815140	Oh, you think so?
4815140	4817140	Hello, everyone, shimmers like that.
4817140	4818140	Everyone.
4818140	4820140	Well, that must be very nice for them.
4820140	4822140	I want to pose you, please.
4822140	4826140	I'm sorry, I'm too busy, but it was nice talking to you.
4826140	4829140	You see, the aliens have invaded Moomin Valley
4829140	4831140	and I must find them.
4831140	4834140	Oh, I just remembered.
4834140	4838140	I was tipped off that there was one of them in Moomin House.
4845140	4847140	The inspector's coming back.
4847140	4849140	What about the alien?
4849140	4850140	He's running after him.
4850140	4852140	Has he been handcuffed, Moomin?
4852140	4854140	I don't think so.
4860140	4863140	Open up in the name of the law, Moomin Papa.
4863140	4865140	Well, certainly for you, Inspector.
4865140	4868140	Come on in, you're very welcome.
4868140	4871140	Moomin Papa, I have information from a reliable source,
4871140	4873140	well, sort of reliable,
4873140	4876140	that you have been hovering a fugitive.
4876140	4878140	I'm sorry.
4878140	4882140	In other words, I believe you have been hiding an alien here.
4882140	4884140	Oh, Inspector, I don't think hiding is the right word.
4884140	4887140	That suggests we are trying to keep something from you.
4887140	4888140	Well, Mama?
4888140	4891140	Would we do that, Inspector?
4893140	4897140	Hmm, that stinky is tricked me again.
4897140	4899140	Isn't it lucky he didn't find you?
4899140	4901140	I want a nice inspector.
4901140	4903140	Look, how many times must I tell you?
4903140	4905140	He'll lock you up in an nasty cell.
4905140	4907140	I like him. I want to see him.
4907140	4909140	No, don't!
4919140	4922140	Perhaps if we press the yellow button, he'll stop sharing.
4922140	4923140	Good idea, Papa.
4923140	4924140	Be quick, Mama.
4926140	4927140	The yellow button.
4927140	4928140	Here goes.
4935140	4938140	You don't want him now that he stopped shining.
4938140	4940140	Do you, little fella?
4940140	4941140	No.
4941140	4943140	Let's go home, man.
4943140	4947140	Moomin Mama, come and look, we've saved the alien.
4949140	4953140	Moomin Mama, the inspector's not glowing anymore.
4953140	4955140	Isn't that something?
4955140	4956140	Mama?
4966140	4967140	Where are you?
4967140	4968140	I'm here.
4969140	4970140	Where?
4970140	4972140	Where are you, Mama?
4974140	4975140	Well, Mama?
4975140	4976140	Right here.
4979140	4980140	Mama?
4980140	4982140	Oh, no, what's happened to you?
4982140	4983140	I don't know.
4983140	4985140	Probably that machine again.
4985140	4989140	Oh, so it shrinks you as well as making you invisible, does it?
4989140	4990140	Well, well.
4990140	4991140	Oh, dear.
4991140	4993140	I need an apron.
4993140	4996140	Papa, can you get a handkerchief from my handbag?
4997140	4999140	You really are quite small.
5000140	5003140	But you look very cute, of course, Mama.
5003140	5005140	Would you like to stay like that for a while?
5005140	5006140	No, I would not.
5006140	5009140	Push another button quickly before anyone sees me.
5009140	5011140	Go on now, hurry up, Papa.
5011140	5012140	Yeah.
5013140	5014140	Oh, dear.
5014140	5015140	What's up?
5016140	5018140	The machine's gone.
5019140	5020140	Oh.
5022140	5023140	Hey, you.
5023140	5025140	Tinky, give me back.
5025140	5026140	Hey.
5026140	5027140	Papa.
5027140	5028140	Don't worry, Mama.
5028140	5030140	I'll get it back.
5038140	5040140	Oh, look at that way.
5040140	5041140	Yeah.
5041140	5043140	Stop him, Moments.
5043140	5044140	Stop him.
5044140	5045140	He stole the machine.
5045140	5047140	We'll get him, Papa.
5049140	5051140	Hey, sniff!
5051140	5052140	Sniff!
5052140	5054140	Don't let Stamkey get away!
5054140	5055140	Right.
5057140	5059140	Inventory!
5063140	5065140	Please let me pass, Sniff.
5065140	5066140	I'll give you a gold stopper and...
5066140	5067140	A gold stopper?
5067140	5068140	I mean, free.
5068140	5069140	No, no, five.
5069140	5070140	Five.
5070140	5071140	No.
5071140	5073140	Give me the machine, Stamkey.
5079140	5081140	Where is it, Moments?
5081140	5083140	What's happened to the machine?
5085140	5088140	It's at the bottom of the river, Papa.
5088140	5091140	Oh, poor Mama. Poor Mama.
5091140	5092140	What's wrong with her?
5092140	5095140	She needs the machine to get back to normal.
5095140	5097140	Normal?
5103140	5107140	Well, at least this is a chance to do some really fine embroidery.
5109140	5110140	Don't worry, Mama.
5110140	5112140	I promise we'll look after you.
5112140	5114140	It's all right, Moomin.
5114140	5115140	I'll manage.
5115140	5118140	I'll have to get some smaller pots and pans, though.
5118140	5121140	And we'll have to have smaller helpings.
5121140	5123140	But that might be a bad idea.
5129140	5130140	Oh.
5139140	5140140	Oh.
5150140	5151140	Here.
5151140	5152140	Here.
5152140	5153140	My house.
5153140	5154140	Come for me.
5155140	5156140	Mama.
5156140	5157140	Papa.
5168140	5171140	It's like the one we saw in the garden.
5194140	5196140	Mama. Papa.
5197140	5198540	Mama, oh.
5202140	5203140	Oh, wait.
5221140	5222640	Impealing.
5222640	5225140	They are telling you of aren't they?
5225140	5226960	I took a flying saucer.
5226960	5231380	Look, would you ask your parents to make mama a normal size again?
5231380	5234880	Yes, of course.
5234880	5236540	Fiddler grassly grassy group!
5236540	5238740	Come on, come on, come on, come on.
5246320	5248780	Oh, well, that's more like it.
5248780	5251820	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, dear.
5251820	5254380	Oh, oh, oh, no, stop, it's too much.
5254460	5257580	Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry, but could you try again, please?
5257580	5259580	I know, but the more a mama there is, the better,
5259580	5262220	but you're getting very large, very large indeed.
5262220	5263220	You need to go.
5263220	5265380	Uh-oh, oh, oh, oh.
5265420	5266420	Oh.
5282420	5285380	So Mumen Valley hadn't really been invaded at all,
5285380	5287300	and the movements and the friends that found out
5287300	5289140	where aliens really looked like.
5289140	5300140	They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.
5300140	5308140	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
5308140	5312140	They're always happy, and always at play.
5312140	5318140	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
5319140	5330140	They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.
5330140	5337140	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
5337140	5341140	They're always happy, and always at play.
5341140	5347140	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
5348140	5352140	The movements.
5352140	5358140	The movements.
5358140	5380140	Here they are for one and all.
5380140	5386140	The movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.
5386140	5391140	They're for you on your TV, they are the movements.
5391140	5394140	They are the movements.
5394140	5397140	So come with me, give me your hand.
5397140	5400140	I'll take you up to a moment land.
5400140	5405140	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever.
5405140	5408140	There were the movements.
5408140	5411140	There were the movements.
5411140	5414140	There were the movements.
5414140	5419140	There were the movements.
5419140	5424140	There were the movements.
5424140	5429140	There were the movements.
5429140	5434140	There were the movements.
5434140	5439140	There were the movements.
5439140	5444140	There were the movements.
5444140	5449140	There were the movements.
5449140	5457140	There were the movements.
5469140	5479140	The movements.
5479140	5487140	The movements.
5487140	5494140	Mumen Valley is enjoying another still peaceful summer's day.
5494140	5498140	However, this lazy lifestyle, no matter how pleasant it might be,
5498140	5503140	does not suit everyone.
5503140	5505140	Yes.
5505140	5508140	Would you like a cup of coffee, dear?
5508140	5511140	Yes, I think I need one, Mama.
5511140	5514140	Oh, dear, is it your memoirs?
5514140	5515140	I'm stuck.
5515140	5517140	Ah, can I help?
5517140	5519140	How can I create in this?
5519140	5520140	In what?
5520140	5522140	In this sleepy atmosphere.
5522140	5524140	I've also come to a boring part.
5524140	5525140	When was that?
5525140	5527140	The time I wrote poems.
5527140	5530140	Were they any good?
5530140	5531140	No.
5531140	5534140	Well, miss that bit out then.
5534140	5535140	I can't.
5535140	5538140	I must put it down for posterity.
5538140	5540140	It is my duty.
5540140	5543140	But how can I get inspiration here in this place
5543140	5546140	when nothing ever happens, nothing ever happens at all?
5546140	5550140	Oh, I think this means another adventure.
5550140	5556140	Yes, Mama, but I need it to be big, exciting, and frightening.
5557140	5560140	Mama, what's the matter?
5560140	5561140	Are you all right?
5561140	5564140	Your father says that because nothing ever happens here,
5564140	5565140	he can't write.
5565140	5568140	So I'm looking for an adventure for him.
5568140	5569140	Can you think of anything?
5569140	5572140	He wants it to be big, exciting, and frightening.
5572140	5574140	Does he want something really exciting?
5574140	5575140	Yes, dear.
5575140	5577140	I'm afraid so.
5577140	5580140	I think I could manage that.
5587140	5592140	That looks like the footprint of a huge monster.
5602140	5606140	Oh, it's a good feeling giving others a bit of excitement.
5606140	5615140	Just a couple more.
5620140	5621140	I'm praised.
5621140	5625140	The booboo I don't have to do modest work very often.
5625140	5630140	Phew, that was harder than I thought.
5630140	5634140	Oi, sleepy hands.
5634140	5636140	Wake up, everybody.
5636140	5639140	Mom and Papa, quickly get up.
5639140	5641140	Mom and Mama, a monster.
5641140	5644140	You've been visited by a monster.
5644140	5646140	Wake up before you eat and alive.
5646140	5649140	Come on, hurry, hurry.
5649140	5653140	I want huge tracks.
5653140	5658140	That should keep them guessing for a while.
5658140	5663140	Hmm, it could be a monster from the depths of the ocean.
5663140	5665140	Something's not right here.
5665140	5668140	Don't you think it's a bit odd that it came directly to Moome House?
5668140	5670140	Well, look at the footsteps.
5670140	5672140	They go in a straight line.
5672140	5678140	Someone must have told it to go to Moome House.
5678140	5680140	And they're only going one way.
5680140	5683140	Look, there are tiny footsteps going back to the sea.
5683140	5686140	Oh, Mama, the monster must still be here then.
5686140	5689140	Oh, well, not necessarily.
5689140	5692140	Retracing one's own footsteps is the sign of an advanced intelligence.
5692140	5695140	Stepping back exactly the way you came.
5695140	5698140	The tough question is, why would the monster do that?
5698140	5702140	One is led to believe that it wants us to think it's still here.
5702140	5706140	Well, in fact, it has gone back to wherever it came from.
5706140	5709140	Fatal battle is my dear mother, would say.
5709140	5712140	But why would it want us to think that, Papa?
5712140	5714140	It's a spy.
5714140	5715140	Oh, it's a spy.
5715140	5716140	Something it shouldn't.
5716140	5720140	It'd hardly be a good spy if we knew they have to sneak in and out.
5720140	5722140	I think it's still here.
5722140	5723140	I can feel it.
5723140	5725140	You know what I mean?
5725140	5727140	Perhaps tonight.
5727140	5729140	Tonight?
5729140	5730140	What about tonight?
5730140	5731140	That's when they'll attack.
5731140	5733140	It's gone back to give its report.
5733140	5735140	How do you know that, Papa?
5735140	5740140	Well, obviously, that's why it still wants us to believe it's here.
5740140	5741140	Mama!
5741140	5742140	Yes, what is it, Moome?
5742140	5744140	Something terrible is going to happen.
5744140	5747140	A monster is going to attack us tonight.
5747140	5749140	And Papa's excited about it.
5749140	5750140	Oh, good.
5750140	5752140	That's nice for him.
5753140	5755140	Hurry, everyone.
5755140	5758140	I expect the monster will be here soon.
5762140	5764140	Oh, poor.
5765140	5767140	Now hold it still.
5768140	5771140	This is going to be a good barricade, don't you think?
5771140	5774140	We'd better make sure it's big enough.
5774140	5778140	It's hardly any fun at all playing tricks on them.
5778140	5780140	They're so gullible!
5782140	5785140	If we catch the monster, we can sell it to a zoo.
5785140	5788140	I'll handle the sale, of course.
5788140	5791140	I'd rather tame it and keep it as a pet.
5791140	5795140	Well, you could ride on it to go pigneking.
5798140	5800140	Oh, no, no.
5809140	5812140	All right, now for the moat.
5812140	5813140	Here we go.
5813140	5816140	I hope the well's got enough water in it.
5817140	5820140	It'll be able to swim in this, Papa.
5820140	5824140	Yes, it'll remind you to the sea and keep it calm.
5824140	5826140	This is fresh water, Papa.
5826140	5828140	We'd better put some salt in it.
5828140	5830140	Good idea, Moome.
5830140	5833140	We'll plant some seaweed and put some rocks in too,
5833140	5835140	and then it'll feel really at home.
5839140	5843140	I wonder when it'll come.
5843140	5847140	I don't know, but I can feel in my bones it'll be tonight.
5847140	5849140	And we keep watching till it comes?
5849140	5851140	Of course we will, constantly.
5851140	5855140	What if it doesn't come until tomorrow night or the night after that?
5855140	5860140	It might be a long wait, so we'll take it in turns and remember everybody.
5860140	5864140	The safety of Moome in Valley relies upon our vigilance.
5864140	5866140	We must be ready.
5869140	5870140	Huh?
5883140	5887140	Look at what those fools have done.
5887140	5889140	It was worth all the trouble.
5892140	5894140	Huh?
5895140	5897140	Look, they put down food as bait.
5897140	5899140	Moome and Papa must be worn out.
5899140	5902140	Well, I'll take the food anyway.
5902140	5903140	Carefully, does it?
5903140	5905140	Don't want to wake up the guard.
5905140	5907140	And this is great.
5909140	5913140	I've managed to play a really good trick on the stupid moments,
5913140	5916140	and they've given me a slap-up meal as well.
5917140	5918140	Ah!
5920140	5922140	Well, well, what's that?
5922140	5924140	The monster's here.
5924140	5925140	Shut the gate.
5927140	5929140	Ah, there's the rope. Quickly.
5931140	5932140	No, no.
5932140	5934140	Stop it, stop it, everybody.
5934140	5935140	To wash.
5938140	5940140	No, it's only me.
5940140	5942140	Make room. I'll get it.
5942140	5943140	Oh, what is it?
5943140	5944140	Oh, what is it?
5944140	5946140	There's no monster only me.
5946140	5949140	Please, it's me. It's me, Stinky.
5949140	5950140	Stinky?
5950140	5952140	Well, it sounds like Stinky.
5952140	5954140	Be careful, everybody. It's a baby monster.
5954140	5957140	Another monster, please help me.
5957140	5959140	I made the footprints.
5959140	5962140	You did. He's obviously lying. He's too small.
5962140	5964140	Watch him, or he'll go get his daddy.
5964140	5966140	No, please, I beg you.
5966140	5968140	Ah, Moome and Papa.
5968140	5970140	Oh, hello, Snuffkin.
5970140	5972140	Why don't you let Stinky go? It really is him, you know.
5973140	5974140	It is?
5975140	5977140	Yes, it was Stinky.
5977140	5979140	And he really did make those footprints.
5979140	5981140	How do you know that, Snuffkin?
5982140	5986140	I was fishing off the shore last night when I saw him digging the holes.
5986140	5989140	The little rascal was at it for hours and hours.
6003140	6005140	Why don't you come inside, Stinky?
6005140	6006140	This is great.
6006140	6009140	It was very good of you to make the footprints.
6009140	6011140	Papa hasn't had so much fun at ages.
6011140	6015140	I'm glad it was hard work and I lost all my hair, too.
6015140	6018140	Well, mischief isn't always easy, you know.
6018140	6021140	You can say that again. This is delicious.
6033140	6035140	Papa!
6051140	6053140	Papa, are you all right?
6053140	6055140	Yes, thank you, Moome.
6063140	6064140	Mama.
6064140	6065140	Yes, dear?
6065140	6068140	Shh, I've got something important to tell you.
6068140	6069140	What is it, Papa?
6069140	6072140	A secret in my mind is made up.
6072140	6073140	Of course, dear.
6073140	6075140	I'm going to run away on an adventure trip.
6075140	6077140	That's nice for you.
6077140	6080140	It's a trip without a destination full of mystery,
6080140	6083140	hazards and hardships and you're coming to, Mama.
6083140	6085140	Oh, splendid.
6085140	6088140	Shall we take all the children or just move in?
6089140	6091140	No, no children.
6091140	6094140	That would be the same as here, only somewhere else.
6094140	6095140	We'll run away.
6095140	6097140	Run away, Moome and Papa?
6097140	6099140	I'll be an adventurer again,
6099140	6101140	just as I was in my lost youth.
6101140	6104140	And with you by my side, we'll have adventure romance.
6104140	6107140	All we desire, the sun, the stars.
6107140	6110140	But what about Moome? He'll be frantic.
6110140	6113140	Whoa, then it's time he learned to stand on his own feet.
6113140	6115140	Fan for himself. Become a man.
6115140	6117140	We can't protect him forever, you know.
6117140	6120140	He's big enough to be left by himself.
6129140	6131140	I'm on, Mama.
6133140	6135140	Oh, just a moment, Papa.
6135140	6138140	You can't take anything more with us.
6138140	6142140	No, I know, but I forgot to write down where the sugar is.
6142140	6146140	If they can't find it, they'll just have to do without.
6146140	6148140	But then they won't be able to make cakes,
6148140	6150140	and the tea will taste awful.
6150140	6152140	Oh, and they'll never find this cinnamon on them.
6152140	6154140	Where shall I leave it?
6154140	6157140	Goodness, Mama, cinnamon, I ask you,
6157140	6160140	when the unknown is calling to us.
6160140	6163140	I should have gone on my own, indeed, I should.
6163140	6165140	But then what good as an adventure, when you can't say who?
6165140	6167140	That was a close shave to someone after us.
6167140	6169140	Is there anything wrong, Papa?
6169140	6173140	No, everything is fine, but we must leave before dawn.
6173140	6175140	All right.
6175140	6177140	We have a long way to go.
6177140	6179140	How far and where?
6179140	6181140	It's very dark, you know.
6181140	6182140	Yes, isn't it?
6182140	6185140	We'll just follow our feet, and they say this way.
6193140	6196140	Oh, God.
6199140	6201140	Good morning, Mama.
6202140	6204140	Mama, where are you?
6205140	6207140	What's the matter, Moomin?
6207140	6209140	My parents are missing.
6209140	6210140	Are you sure?
6210140	6212140	Of course, I'm sure.
6212140	6214140	That's a bit of a problem, I'm getting hungry.
6214140	6215140	I need my breakfast.
6215140	6217140	I have to start the day with a good meal.
6217140	6218140	I'm starving.
6218140	6220140	Me, too.
6222140	6224140	I'm starving.
6224140	6225140	I'm starving.
6225140	6226140	I'm starving.
6226140	6227140	I'm starving.
6227140	6228140	I'm starving.
6228140	6230140	I'm starving.
6230140	6231140	I'm starving.
6231140	6233140	I'm starving.
6234140	6236140	Don't worry, Moomin.
6236140	6239140	I'm sure that Moomin, Mama and Moomin, Papa
6239140	6241140	will be back home very soon.
6241140	6243140	But where could they have gone to, Snuffkin?
6243140	6244140	No idea.
6244140	6246140	Have they left a note?
6246140	6248140	Have you had your breakfast yet, Moomin?
6248140	6250140	No, nothing.
6250140	6252140	It's not the shame without Mama.
6252140	6254140	Cheer up, Moomin.
6254140	6256140	You can have this fish.
6256140	6260140	And I'll come up to Moomin House and cook it especially for you, if you like.
6260140	6262140	Thanks, Snuffkin.
6262140	6264140	But there are two cooks there already.
6264140	6267140	Little May and Snuff are both trying to cook.
6267140	6269140	A bit of this, a bit of that.
6269140	6271140	This is great.
6271140	6275140	There's lots of delicious things I want to try out.
6275140	6278140	Where are we, Papa?
6278140	6280140	No idea, Mama.
6280140	6283140	Too dark to see anything at all.
6283140	6285140	We've been gone for hours.
6285140	6288140	I think it should have been light by now.
6289140	6291140	Oh dear, we have to face it.
6291140	6292140	I'm afraid we're lost.
6292140	6294140	I'm sorry, Mama, but there it is.
6294140	6296140	Oh, what do you mean?
6296140	6299140	Well, in the dark, we must have wandered into some caves.
6299140	6301140	Who knows how many different tunnels we took.
6301140	6304140	It could be weeks before we find our way.
6309140	6312140	Little May, it's burning.
6312140	6313140	Mind your own business.
6313140	6315140	I might like burnt food.
6315140	6316140	It's very nutritious.
6316140	6317140	Watch your own cooking.
6317140	6320140	Couldn't be any worse than the last lot you made for us.
6320140	6321140	Ha!
6321140	6322140	I wonder where Moomin is.
6322140	6323140	He likes my food.
6323140	6324140	I'll get him to try it.
6324140	6326140	He can try mine first.
6326140	6328140	Now that I've practiced, it'll be perfect.
6328140	6331140	Oh man, I've done something for you!
6342140	6343140	Ah!
6348140	6349140	Mama!
6360140	6362140	Mama!
6363140	6365140	Mama!
6378140	6380140	Mama!
6388140	6390140	What was that?
6398140	6400140	Mom and Papa, wake up!
6401140	6403140	Mom and Papa?
6408140	6410140	Mom and Papa, wake up!
6424140	6425140	Ooh!
6429140	6431140	It tastes brackish.
6431140	6433140	We must be quite near the sea.
6438140	6439140	Mama!
6457140	6459140	That's a big one.
6463140	6464140	Gotcha!
6468140	6469140	Moomin!
6469140	6470140	Moomin!
6470140	6472140	Where are you so far from home?
6472140	6473140	Mama!
6473140	6474140	At last!
6474140	6476140	Look, I've got a big fish!
6476140	6478140	Come and help me quickly!
6478140	6480140	Don't let it get away!
6489140	6492140	I've never seen such a big fish moving!
6492140	6494140	Just wait till Papa sees it!
6495140	6497140	Oh yes, Moomin Papa.
6497140	6498140	This looks familiar.
6498140	6500140	It's Moomin Falley, isn't it?
6500140	6503140	Of course it is, just outside the cave.
6503140	6504140	Oh dear.
6504140	6507140	I'm afraid that your father will be a bit disappointed.
6507140	6508140	Where is he then?
6508140	6509140	Well...
6512140	6514140	He's gone, looking for adventure.
6514140	6515140	Adventure?
6515140	6516140	Where?
6516140	6517140	I don't really know.
6517140	6518140	Somewhere.
6518140	6520140	I could have gone with him.
6520140	6522140	When's he coming home?
6523140	6525140	I'm afraid I don't know that either.
6525140	6528140	You know Papa tonight, tomorrow night.
6528140	6530140	Next Christmas.
6530140	6533140	Your guess is as good as mine, Moomin.
6533140	6534140	Wow!
6534140	6537140	I bet he's having a great adventure right now!
6537140	6538140	Hey, Mama!
6550140	6551140	Mama!
6553140	6555140	Hello, where are you?
6556140	6557140	Oh.
6557140	6560140	Oh, the cave dwellers must have her.
6561140	6562140	Oh.
6562140	6563140	Mama.
6570140	6572140	Mama!
6572140	6573140	Mama!
6573140	6574140	Oh!
6574140	6576140	Can you hear me?
6576140	6577140	Oh!
6582140	6585140	Goodness, the sea.
6594140	6597140	Oh, this looks like...
6597140	6599140	Oh, it gets...
6599140	6601140	Oh, dear.
6604140	6607140	Terry, me, I don't...
6607140	6610140	Oh, well...
6610140	6612140	Oh, my...
6612140	6614140	Oh, you see?
6614140	6616140	In my video...
6616140	6618140	Here, this is it.
6618140	6620140	Oh, yeah!
6620140	6621140	Of course!
6621140	6623140	Helio, me.
6630140	6633140	Oh, look! Look! It's Papa!
6633140	6636140	Papa's back, everyone!
6636140	6637140	Uh-huh.
6637140	6639140	Hi, Papa!
6640140	6642140	Oh.
6642140	6645140	Well, I'm back.
6645140	6647140	I'm so pleased to see you again.
6647140	6649140	Thank you, Mama.
6649140	6652140	Papa, how was your adventure?
6652140	6654140	I'm unexpected.
6654140	6655140	Yes, that's what I'd say.
6655140	6657140	Unexpected. Any food.
6657140	6659140	Oh, yes. You can try mine.
6659140	6660140	First, Moomin, Papa.
6660140	6662140	Oh, mine's the best. Try mine, Papa.
6662140	6664140	Oh, that's good. I'm starving.
6664140	6666140	Tell us about your adventure.
6667140	6668140	I love you.
6668140	6671140	Were you an immortal danger? Did you eat any rats?
6671140	6672140	Yeah, I am.
6672140	6673140	Suppose there's adventure.
6673140	6676140	I don't think Papa wants to talk about his adventure yet.
6676140	6678140	Maybe later.
6678140	6681140	And that was the end of Mama and Papa's adventure.
6681140	6683140	They didn't get far, but then...
6683140	6686140	You don't have to sometimes for things to happen.
6686140	6689140	Or at least for you to think they're happening.
6689140	6699140	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
6699140	6707140	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
6707140	6711140	They're always happy and always at play.
6711140	6718140	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
6718140	6728140	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
6728140	6736140	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
6736140	6740140	They're always happy and always at play.
6740140	6747140	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
6747140	6751140	The movements.
6751140	6757140	The movements.
6757140	6763140	The movements.
6788140	6793140	The movements.
6793140	6797140	The movements.
6797140	6801140	The movements.
6801140	6807140	The movements.
6807140	6811140	The movements.
6811140	6815140	The movements.
6815140	6819140	The movements.
6819140	6823140	The movements.
6823140	6827140	The movements.
6827140	6833140	The movements.
6833140	6837140	The movements.
6837140	6841140	The movements.
6841140	6845140	The movements.
6845140	6855140	The movements.
6865140	6871140	It was the end of summer, but still every day seemed harder than the last.
6871140	6873140	It was the end of telescending for the last.
6873140	6877140	Womenbowl had no rain for weeks and finally the river had dried up.
6877140	6881140	Dad says this weather is a catastrophe snuffing.
6881140	6883140	Oh no, ready.
6883140	6885140	But it is.
6885140	6887140	He says this mountain valley will turn into a desert if it carries on.
6887140	6889140	I don't think that will happen.
6889140	6892140	Dad can't ever remember it so hot.
6892140	6894140	Even the river has dried up.
6894140	6896140	No, that does worry me.
6896140	6898140	I can't fish anymore.
6898140	6902260	When all my travels, I found that droughts like this are always followed by a real heavy
6902260	6903260	downpour.
6903260	6910500	Well, it's too hot for me anyway.
6910500	6923620	Oh, it's so hot, I can't think.
6923620	6952220	Well, well, even the weeds are wilting.
6952220	6954500	The sea never dries up, does it?
6954500	6957220	Of course not stupid, wherever the fish go.
6957220	6962220	I'm going swimming.
6962220	6991500	Here you are.
6991500	7004540	It's loose.
7004540	7034540	I'm going to have to go back to my old house, but I'm not going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house,
7034540	7042280	Look at this.
7042280	7052360	Like a tile, like a tile.
7052360	7062360	Oh, that hurt. What's this stupid box doing here? I think it's floated from foreign lands.
7062360	7067360	What's it got in it? Perhaps it's full of priceless jewels.
7067360	7070360	No, it wouldn't float so high in the water if it was.
7070360	7075360	A tiara packed in wood shavings. I could use a new comb, too.
7075360	7078360	What have you found you, too, a treasure?
7078360	7082360	No, we don't think so. It's not heavy enough. But you never know, Snork Maiden.
7082360	7084360	Let's open it and see.
7084360	7087360	Come on, Slay's. Push me a shore.
7092360	7096360	Perhaps it's gold nuggets in here. Our diamonds are something to eat.
7109360	7110360	What is this?
7112360	7113360	Seeds, maybe.
7113360	7114360	What sort of seeds?
7118360	7122360	Hmm. Well, at first glance, I'd say they might be tropical plants.
7122360	7123360	Oh, really, Mr. Hemie.
7123360	7125360	What plants are tropical?
7125360	7127360	Well, species like banana are mangoes.
7127360	7130360	Banana? And mangoes.
7130360	7136360	Well, I haven't done a lot of research on tropical plants, so I can't be sure, but they do look like it.
7136360	7139360	I know, Mama. Why don't we plant them?
7139360	7140360	Good idea, Moomin.
7140360	7145360	The thing is, we don't have a tropical climate. I'm afraid they wouldn't grow here at all.
7145360	7147360	Let's plant them, shall we?
7147360	7150360	They won't bear any fruit, so don't get too excited.
7150360	7154360	Oh, well, it seems tropical enough to me, Mr. Hemie.
7154360	7156360	At least we can try, can't we?
7156360	7159360	I want to see what papaya looks like and ugly fruit.
7159360	7162360	I want mangoes growing all around my bedroom window.
7162360	7164360	Let's plant them, shall we?
7167360	7172360	I tell you, they're strictly tropical. They won't take root at all.
7172360	7197360	It certainly seems that Mama is enjoying herself, Mr. Hemie.
7197360	7199360	I don't think it'll be much use.
7199360	7203360	Perhaps not, but it's so worth the farm and trying.
7203360	7207360	Imagine Moomin Valley, a tropical jungle.
7207360	7213360	Oh, Mr. Hemie, do you think these seeds will grow into real fruit trees?
7213360	7223360	Let me see. What have you got here, little my? I could very well be mistaken, but I think this one is a mango seed.
7223360	7225360	Thanks.
7225360	7228360	And why do you want to know, little my?
7228360	7235360	Because I'm only growing fruit. I want to be sure I'm not planting stupid orchids or passion flowers or something.
7235360	7243360	Mr. Hemie, can you tell me which one of these is banana?
7243360	7246360	I'm not really too sure, but I think it's this one.
7246360	7249360	You want to grow an orchid too, snorkemaiden?
7249360	7255360	No, I just want to plant a banana tree in a really special place. It's Moomin's favorite fruit.
7259360	7263360	I think she'll be disappointed bananas won't grow here.
7263360	7270360	This weather doesn't belong here either. If it gets any hotter, I'll melt. I can't wait for dusk so it'll cool down a bit.
7282360	7285360	Isn't it wonderful to go to sleep looking at the stars?
7286360	7288360	And it's not so hot anymore.
7288360	7290360	I'll sleep like a log tonight.
7290360	7293360	You always do, don't you, little my?
7293360	7296360	Well, sleep like an extra heavy log, then.
7302360	7306360	Snorkemaiden, why don't you sleep under that tree with Moomin and little my?
7306360	7311360	Oh, because I can't see the stars from there and it makes me feel romantic looking at them.
7311360	7315360	But you're going to get very wet if it starts raining in the night.
7315360	7317360	You're joking, surely, Mama.
7317360	7319360	Not at all.
7319360	7324360	But it hasn't rained for ages, and there aren't any clouds or anything. Just stars.
7324360	7328360	All the toothpicks fell on the floor, and that's a sure sign of rain.
7328360	7332360	Snorkemaiden won't mind if she gets all wet, Moomin, Mama. That should be happy.
7334360	7335360	Who? Why is that?
7336360	7341360	Because then she'll know that the special tree will start growing, and that's very important to her.
7342360	7347360	That's true. Good night, everyone. I hope you sleep well.
7355360	7357360	Good night, everybody.
7366360	7368360	Good night, Moomin.
7368360	7370360	Good night, don't snore.
7385360	7388360	It's too hot to sleep.
7388360	7392360	Why don't you sleep outside like the children?
7392360	7394360	I think I will.
7404360	7406360	A thunderstorm.
7406360	7409360	I told you the toothpicks are never wrong.
7418360	7419360	Oh!
7419360	7421360	Hey, it's raining, Moomin!
7422360	7424360	Wake up, Moomin!
7424360	7426360	Oh, is it morning?
7426360	7428360	The sun's really bright.
7428360	7430360	No, it's raining.
7430360	7432360	Rainy?
7432360	7434360	Look at that.
7434360	7437360	You look, I'm getting wet, I'm going inside.
7437360	7439360	So Mama was right about the rain.
7439360	7442360	Hey, Snorkemaiden!
7442360	7444360	Doesn't she look sweet?
7444360	7446360	Snorkemaiden!
7446360	7447360	Is it raining?
7447360	7448360	That's very clever.
7448360	7451360	Your mother knows everything doesn't she?
7451360	7452360	She does.
7452360	7454360	Now let's get into the house.
7454360	7457360	Not yet. I want to feel the rain on my face.
7457360	7459360	It's been so long.
7462360	7463360	Ah!
7463360	7466360	Do you want to feel it much longer?
7512360	7513360	Oh!
7513360	7515360	It's the raining.
7522360	7523360	Mangoes!
7523360	7525360	That's impossible!
7525360	7527360	Gosh!
7529360	7531360	By my tail, a jungle!
7531360	7533360	That's a tropical jungle!
7533360	7534360	Wake up!
7534360	7536360	Wake up, you two!
7536360	7538360	There's a jungle outside!
7538360	7540360	We've planted a jungle!
7540360	7541360	A jungle?
7564360	7567360	Your right moment, those seeds have not only sprouted.
7567360	7569360	I know, they're big trees.
7569360	7572360	I've never known trees to grow like that.
7572360	7573360	That's...
7573360	7575360	I think I'll go and play Tarzan.
7577360	7580360	I wish my lettuce seeds would do that moment, Papa.
7580360	7582360	There's magic here somewhere, Mama.
7582360	7584360	Let's go and explore.
7587360	7590360	That's rain drumming on the campus.
7594360	7596360	It must be.
7596360	7598360	Snuffkin!
7603360	7605360	What a nurse all this!
7605360	7609360	Well, we found a crate of tropical seeds and planted them last night.
7609360	7612360	And this morning, while you can see it's like magic.
7612360	7614360	It's fantastic.
7614360	7617360	I know. We can go on a safari.
7618360	7620360	I've seen nothing like it.
7626360	7628360	What kind of flower is this?
7628360	7630360	It looks like an orchid to me.
7630360	7633360	This is a real tropical jungle, isn't it, Snuffkin?
7633360	7634360	Not quite.
7634360	7635360	What do you mean?
7635360	7639360	Well, Moomin, a real jungle would have wild animals in it, wouldn't it?
7639360	7641360	Oh, yeah, like tigers and snakes.
7641360	7646360	This is more of a tropical botanical garden, I suppose.
7648360	7650360	That's Moomin's little mind.
7650360	7652360	He can have the peel.
7660360	7663360	This is a life.
7666360	7668360	Stop, little mind.
7668360	7670360	Well, well.
7673360	7675360	What are you looking for, dear?
7675360	7677360	My solar topi.
7677360	7678360	You what?
7678360	7681360	My sun helmet, I can't go into the jungle without it.
7681360	7683360	I didn't know you had one.
7683360	7686360	I used it for a fancy dress party once, I know.
7686360	7688360	I put it in a box somewhere.
7688360	7690360	Oh, here it is.
7690360	7692360	Very dashing, dear.
7692360	7693360	I thought so too.
7693360	7695360	Oh, I know.
7701360	7703360	Oh!
7703360	7705360	Oh!
7711360	7714360	Splendid protection is hat.
7719360	7721360	Papa?
7721360	7723360	What in earth are you doing?
7723360	7726360	I want to get into the cello.
7726360	7727360	What for?
7727360	7729360	To get my gun.
7729360	7730360	Your gun?
7730360	7734360	Only fools venture into the jungle without a proper gun.
7734360	7736360	I don't think you need a gun, Papa.
7736360	7738360	And why not?
7738360	7740360	Because there aren't any wild animals.
7740360	7744360	Well, one of the seas might have been an egg or something.
7744360	7746360	Look at these, for instance.
7746360	7748360	They look very animal.
7750360	7752360	Very odd animals.
7752360	7754360	More of an odd plant, I think.
7754360	7755360	I'd stay away from them.
7755360	7757360	They could be very dangerous.
7757360	7759360	Look, they've got eyes.
7759360	7761360	I think they're man-eating plants.
7761360	7763360	Man-eating.
7763360	7765360	Hey, stop that.
7765360	7767360	Stop that.
7767360	7769360	Help!
7769360	7771360	They're trying to eat me.
7771360	7773360	But they want to feed me to that young.
7773360	7775360	Oh, oh, oh, oh, help me.
7775360	7777360	Help!
7777360	7779360	They're tearing my tail up.
7779360	7783360	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
7783360	7785360	Oh, no, oh, dear.
7785360	7787360	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
7787360	7794200	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
7794200	7795200	Oh, oh.
7795200	7796400	Uh-oh.
7796400	7800840	Well, done, my little Maya just saved my life.
7800840	7803160	Well, I saved your tail anyway.
7803160	7804880	Oh, oh.
7804880	7805880	Huh.
7805880	7808540	Look, oh, oh.
7808540	7811540	Get something to jam this door shut.
7811540	7812540	Come on.
7812540	7813520	Hurry.
7815120	7816340	Oh, oh.
7816340	7818340	I don't know. You can't hold on to much longer.
7836340	7838340	That should keep them in now, shouldn't it?
7838340	7841340	Well, I don't think they could push their way through that lot.
7841340	7843340	They had a very strong grip on my tail.
7843340	7845340	He mustn't underestimate them.
7845340	7846340	Anything wrong?
7846340	7849340	You bet the seller's full of man-eating plants
7849340	7851340	trying to gobble up moment papa.
7851340	7854340	Oh, my goodness.
7854340	7855340	What's the matter?
7855340	7858340	You can get straight from the seller into the kitchen.
7858340	7861340	What? Oh, no, mama.
7861340	7862340	Oh.
7875340	7877340	Oh, hello.
7877340	7879340	Cue, we got here just in time.
7879340	7882340	Whatever's the matter with you, are you all playing Tarzan?
7882340	7883340	Oh, no, mama.
7883340	7887340	I'm making grandmas if you ever get a tropical fruit recipe.
7887340	7890340	And perhaps now it's rained I can wash this dirty floor.
7892340	7899340	Ah, by the great bumble, I don't believe this a tropical rainforest.
7899340	7904340	Ah, ah, a transcendentia, megaloids.
7904340	7907340	And yes, a dyspepsia, flora, and munda.
7907340	7912340	Goodness me, I can collect a whole tropical hermoreum right here in Mum and Valley.
7912340	7916340	I travel. That's what I need. I'll get one from the Mormons.
7922340	7926340	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
7926340	7928340	Must say they're not the tiniest family.
7928340	7931340	I'll have to move this.
7931340	7934340	Oh, this old furniture.
7946340	7948340	Do I look that funny?
7948340	7949340	No, you look great.
7949340	7952340	Maybe you and Tarzan have different muscles.
7952340	7954340	Me, Tarzan.
7954340	7955340	You, Jay.
7955340	7956340	Oh, oh.
7956340	7958340	Oh, here we go.
7958340	7960340	Me, get out with Army Six.
7962340	7963340	Ah!
7963340	7964340	Ah, help!
7964340	7967340	I've got man-eating plants after this.
7967340	7969340	What? They must have come out.
7969340	7971340	Oh.
7975340	7977340	Uh-oh.
7980340	7983340	They were in the cellar.
7983340	7985340	Did you open the door, Mr. Hamilon?
7985340	7988340	Well, yes, I wanted to borrow a trowel.
7988340	7991340	Mr. Hamilon, you know all about plants.
7991340	7993340	Do you have any idea how we can get rid of them?
7993340	7995340	They're man-eaters, you know?
7995340	7997340	Can't rid of them.
7997340	7999340	Well, let's see.
7999340	8001340	We are in a bit of a fix.
8001340	8004340	I have heard that they have react to music.
8004340	8005340	Music.
8006340	8007340	Music.
8007340	8010340	Snuffkin, you could play your harmonica.
8010340	8011340	Hmm.
8028340	8030340	Look, they've started dancing.
8030340	8032340	Keep it up, Snuffkin.
8035340	8036340	Hmm.
8048340	8051340	What will they do if he stops playing?
8051340	8053340	I really don't know.
8059340	8061340	Oh, that's this.
8061340	8062340	Oh.
8066340	8067340	Oh.
8071340	8075340	They're rather sweet when they don't try to eat you.
8075340	8078340	And that was how a tropical jungle grew
8078340	8081340	and surrounded movement house in one night.
8081340	8082340	Is it going to stay?
8082340	8084340	And for how long?
8084340	8090340	And what will the man-eating plants do if Snuffkin stops playing?
8091340	8099340	They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.
8099340	8106340	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
8106340	8110340	They're always happy and always at play.
8110340	8114340	The movements are having fun day after day.
8114340	8121340	They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.
8121340	8128340	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
8128340	8132340	They're always happy and always at play.
8132340	8137340	The movements are having fun day after day.
8137340	8140340	The movements are having fun day after day.
8140340	8144340	The movements are having fun day after day.
8144340	8147340	The movements.
8147340	8151340	The movements.
8151340	8157340	The movements.
8170340	8179340	Here they are for one and all.
8179340	8182340	The movements are about to come.
8182340	8185340	Come on and sit down here with me.
8185340	8187340	They're here for you on your TV.
8187340	8190340	They are the movements.
8190340	8193340	They are the movements.
8193340	8196340	So come with me, give me your hand.
8196340	8199340	I'll take you up to a movement land.
8199340	8202340	You can fly just like a bird.
8202340	8204340	Sing that song ever.
8204340	8207340	There were the movements.
8207340	8210340	There were the movements.
8210340	8213340	There were the movements.
8213340	8216340	There were the movements.
8216340	8219340	There were the movements.
8219340	8222340	There were the movements.
8229340	8259340	La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
8259340	8289340	The seeds that movement and his friends had found in a box that had been cast up on the beach had grown into a tropical forest. It was beautiful, but also dangerous, with man-eating plants kept at bay by snuffkin playing his harmonica. But for how long?
8289340	8307340	Oh dear. Oh! Snuffkin, don't stop playing your harmonica whatever you do or did they'll only get angry and attack us all over again. If I don't stop soon, I might never want to play again.
8307340	8318340	Well, perhaps the music has made them more friendly. Be careful, Mr. Himmelon. Oh, don't worry.
8318340	8328340	Mr. Himmelon, look out!
8328340	8338340	Huh? Ah, ah, ah! I warn him. I don't think the quickly snuffkin' play again.
8338340	8339340	Ah!
8341340	8342340	Ah!
8342340	8343340	Ah!
8343340	8344340	Ah!
8344340	8345340	Ah!
8345340	8346340	Ah!
8346340	8347340	Ah!
8347340	8348340	Ah!
8348340	8350340	Ah!
8350340	8352340	Ah!
8352340	8354340	Ah!
8354340	8356340	Ah!
8356340	8357340	Ah!
8357340	8359340	Ah!
8359340	8361340	Ah!
8361340	8363340	Ah!
8363340	8367340	Papa, we must make sure the trap door won't open again.
8367340	8369340	Ah, yes.
8369340	8371340	What's this about a trap door?
8371340	8372340	In the kitchen.
8372340	8374340	They almost got in before and attacked Mama.
8374340	8376340	We reached her just in time.
8383340	8385340	Ah, there they are.
8389340	8390340	Ah!
8390340	8392340	Ah!
8392340	8394340	Ah!
8394340	8395340	Ah!
8395340	8396340	Ah!
8396340	8397340	Ah!
8397340	8398340	Ah!
8398340	8399340	Ah!
8399340	8400340	Ah!
8400340	8401340	Ah!
8401340	8402340	Ah!
8402340	8403340	Ah!
8403340	8404340	Ah!
8404340	8405340	Ah!
8405340	8406340	Ah!
8406340	8407340	Ah!
8407340	8408340	Ah!
8408340	8409340	Ah!
8409340	8411340	Ah!
8411340	8412340	Ah!
8412340	8413340	Ah!
8413340	8414340	Ah!
8414340	8415340	Ah!
8415340	8416340	Ah!
8416340	8417340	Ah!
8417340	8418340	Ah!
8418340	8419340	Ah!
8419340	8420340	Ah!
8420340	8421340	I feel sorry for them.
8421340	8423340	It can be helpful, Snowfkin.
8423340	8424340	We'll let them out.
8424340	8425340	We'll be...
8425340	8426340	It in a life.
8426340	8431340	It makes me feel very uncomfortable,
8431340	8433340	having man-eating plants under the floor.
8433340	8435340	Always keep a kettle of boiling water,
8435340	8438340	handy in case they break through.
8438340	8441340	The children are playing Tarzan.
8441340	8443340	They might as well,
8443340	8445340	seeing as they've got a jungle to play in.
8445340	8448340	Still, planting those seeds might have been a terrible mistake.
8448340	8451340	Well, Mama, I'm very glad that you did.
8451340	8453340	Just think what I would have missed,
8453340	8455340	and movement value suddenly being full
8455340	8457340	of tropical plants is wonderful.
8457340	8459340	I'm not fond of traveling, as you know,
8459340	8462340	and you've brought the plants to me.
8462340	8464340	Oh, the trees make it much cooler,
8464340	8466340	but those man-eaters,
8466340	8468340	who I could do without them.
8468340	8469340	Ah!
8469340	8471340	Ah!
8476340	8478340	You're just like Tarzan.
8478340	8480340	Tarzan loves Jane.
8480340	8482340	Oh, what bliss!
8486340	8487340	Stinky's over there.
8487340	8488340	Stinky!
8488340	8491340	Tarzan, teach Old Betty lesson.
8491340	8493340	Yaaah!
8496340	8497340	Ah!
8497340	8498340	Ah!
8504340	8505340	Oh!
8505340	8506340	Oh, dear!
8506340	8509340	Pretty stupid moment playing Tarzan
8509340	8510340	without wild animals.
8510340	8512340	Well, animals don't come from seeds.
8512340	8514340	No, but you need them to have a real jungle.
8514340	8516340	I can get you some if you want.
8516340	8517340	Really?
8517340	8519340	I'll do anything for my friends.
8519340	8521340	That's very kind of you.
8521340	8522340	Not too wild, though.
8522340	8525340	No lions or tigers or anything.
8525340	8527340	Maybe, yet maybe chimpanzee.
8527340	8530340	I know exactly what you need.
8533340	8535340	Cheese.
8535340	8537340	Bread.
8537340	8539340	Ah!
8541340	8543340	What are you doing, Mama?
8543340	8547340	Well, I don't like the thought of all those man-eaters still in the cellar.
8547340	8550340	So your father and I are going to sleep in the bathhouse.
8550340	8552340	We'll sleep outdoors, too.
8552340	8554340	We've just built ourselves a hut.
8554340	8556340	It's not made in a little mind, too.
8556340	8558340	Yes, there's plenty of room.
8558340	8559340	Oh, right.
8559340	8562340	So that only leaves Mr. Himmel and sleeping in the house.
8562340	8565340	And he still busy checking all the different plans.
8567340	8570340	Mama, is everything ready?
8570340	8572340	Oh, yes, dear.
8574340	8576340	Oh, I'm all ready.
8576340	8578340	Yes, we are, Mr. Himmel and...
8578340	8580340	See you later.
8587340	8591340	Stinky said he could get some wild animals, Papa.
8591340	8592340	Where ever fro?
8592340	8593340	I don't know.
8593340	8594340	I wouldn't trust him.
8594340	8597340	He'll probably put a head jog in your sleeping bag.
8597340	8598340	There it is.
8598340	8599340	The hut.
8599340	8603340	Oh, oh. Very well built.
8603340	8604340	Oh, oh.
8604340	8605340	Oh, oh.
8605340	8606340	Oh, oh.
8606340	8607340	Oh, oh.
8607340	8608340	Oh, oh.
8608340	8609340	Oh, oh.
8609340	8610340	Oh, oh.
8610340	8611340	Oh, oh.
8611340	8612340	Oh, oh.
8612340	8613340	Oh, oh.
8613340	8614340	Oh, oh.
8614340	8615340	Oh, oh.
8615340	8616340	Oh, oh.
8616340	8617340	Oh, oh.
8617340	8618340	Oh, oh.
8618340	8619340	Oh, oh.
8619340	8620340	Oh, oh.
8620340	8621340	Oh, oh.
8621340	8622340	Oh, oh.
8622340	8623340	Oh, oh.
8623340	8624340	Oh, oh.
8624340	8625340	Oh, oh.
8625340	8626340	Oh, oh.
8626340	8627340	Oh, oh.
8627340	8628340	Oh, oh.
8628340	8629340	Oh, oh.
8629340	8630340	Oh, oh.
8630340	8631340	Oh, oh.
8631340	8632340	Oh, oh.
8633340	8634340	Oh, oh.
8639340	8640340	Oh!
8641340	8642340	Oh.
8642340	8644340	Oh.
8644340	8646340	I tell you, it's a wonderful place.
8646340	8647340	You love it.
8647340	8649340	A real tropical jungle.
8649340	8651340	Are you sure it's quite nice here?
8651340	8653340	Of course, therein!
8653340	8654340	There yaaay!
8654340	8658340	Oh, lovely. It is to run free.
8658340	8664340	Darling, let's be the first to get to Moomin Valley.
8664340	8666340	Oh, my God.
8666340	8668340	Oh, my God.
8668340	8670340	Oh, my God.
8670340	8672340	Oh, my God.
8672340	8674340	Oh, my God.
8674340	8676340	Oh, my God.
8676340	8678340	Oh, my God.
8678340	8682340	Oh, my God.
8682340	8684340	Ugh.
8684340	8686340	Ugh.
8686340	8688340	Ugh.
8688340	8692340	Soon I'll have the largest collection in the botanic world.
8692340	8696340	And I will be famous and people will come from all over.
8696340	8698340	Ugh.
8698340	8702340	Now what have we here?
8702340	8706340	Ugh.
8706340	8708340	Ugh.
8708340	8718340	Go away, I'm not a zoologist.
8718340	8720340	Look, Moomin, those must be the monkey stinky promise.
8720340	8722340	Well, that's a surprise.
8722340	8724340	Not like him at all.
8724340	8728340	I just don't trust him.
8728340	8730340	What sweet things.
8730340	8734340	Just like in Tarzan.
8734340	8736340	What was that?
8736340	8738340	I don't know.
8738340	8742340	Ugh.
8742340	8748340	That sounds like some really wild animal, a lion or a tiger.
8748340	8754340	I'm frightened, Moomin.
8754340	8758340	Huh?
8758340	8762340	Ugh.
8762340	8764340	Very odd.
8764340	8766340	Just like home, isn't it?
8766340	8768340	Even if it isn't very big.
8768340	8770340	Perhaps we could live here.
8770340	8772340	Let's go hunting first.
8772340	8774340	I smell Moomin's.
8774340	8776340	Oh, be careful darling.
8776340	8780340	You're very out of practice.
8780340	8786340	I must warn them.
8786340	8788340	See anything?
8788340	8790340	No other thing.
8790340	8794340	I must have been imagination.
8794340	8796340	Moomin.
8796340	8798340	Keep quiet.
8798340	8800340	Little Moin.
8800340	8802340	I've just seen some tigers.
8802340	8804340	They're coming to get you.
8804340	8806340	Tigers.
8806340	8808340	Let's get back to the house quick.
8808340	8810340	There's no time.
8810340	8812340	They're nearly here.
8812340	8816340	We'll go to the bathhouse.
8820340	8824340	Shall we eat him up?
8824340	8828340	You know that Hamilins upset your tummy, dear rest?
8828340	8832340	I wonder where the Moomin's are.
8832340	8838340	Huh?
8838340	8844340	Ugh, just more animals that's all.
8844340	8850340	Papa!
8850340	8856340	Papa! Help!
8856340	8860340	What's the matter, Moomin?
8860340	8864340	Little Moin has seen two tigers and they're looking for us.
8864340	8866340	Tigers after us.
8866340	8870340	That rotten sticky probably told them we're good to eat or something.
8870340	8872340	Maybe we are.
8872340	8873340	They'll be here in a minute.
8873340	8877340	Right, Moomin. You go and find the biggest stone you can and bring it back with you.
8877340	8881340	Okay.
8889340	8893340	This way.
8903340	8905340	Papa, will this one do?
8905340	8909340	Yes, that's perfect. Right, get into the bathhouse and it's quickly now.
8933340	8937340	Here they come.
8941340	8945340	Are you really going to eat them, dear rest?
8945340	8949340	Of course, my love. You see, I think they're hiding in that little house up there.
8949340	8953340	They've been very quiet if they are.
8953340	8957340	Huh, they're just too scared to move. That's all.
8957340	8961340	Why's that stone there?
8961340	8965340	My darling!
8965340	8967340	It's worth, Papa.
8967340	8971340	Well, of course, Moomin.
8971340	8975340	My husband is drowning.
8975340	8979340	Oh, I'm so sorry. Papa, we must help.
8979340	8983340	He was just about to try and eat us, Mama.
8983340	8987340	I'm sure he won't do it again.
8987340	8991340	I suppose so, Moomin.
9011340	9015340	Oh, my love.
9015340	9021340	I thought I'd see the day. Moomin's rescuing a tiger.
9021340	9025340	Here you are, dear. Tie this tightly around him and we'll lift him out.
9025340	9029340	Thank you, Mama.
9029340	9033340	Oh, darling.
9033340	9037340	Are you all right, my love?
9037340	9039340	What happened? Did we eat them?
9039340	9043340	No, you were drowning and they rescued you.
9043340	9045340	Oh, now embarrassing.
9045340	9047340	Well, they're in that cabin behind you.
9047340	9049340	If you still feel like it.
9049340	9051340	Oh, darling.
9051340	9055340	Are you all right, my love?
9055340	9057340	What happened? Did we eat them?
9057340	9059340	They're in that cabin behind you.
9059340	9063340	If you still feel hungry, but it was rather good of them to save you.
9063340	9065340	No, my appetite's completely gone.
9065340	9067340	We'll come back here then and we'll go.
9067340	9069340	I'll just jump over.
9075340	9077340	Oh!
9077340	9079340	What's the matter?
9079340	9081340	I can't remember how to jump.
9081340	9083340	We've been stuck in that zoo for too long.
9083340	9085340	Let's try and swim across, dear.
9087340	9089340	Okay.
9091340	9093340	Hmm?
9099340	9102340	We come, everyone. The tigers are leaving.
9102340	9105340	I'm glad you didn't grow.
9109340	9112340	I knew they wouldn't be mean enough to eat us after saving him.
9112340	9116340	Shall we jump in and swim back as well? It's not far.
9116340	9118340	Yes. I'll go first.
9118340	9120340	I want to go first.
9120340	9122340	Darling, am I?
9122340	9124340	Be careful, movement.
9124340	9126340	Look over there.
9130340	9132340	Crocodiles.
9132340	9136340	Hurry up, movement. Swim around the back and come up the ladder.
9142340	9144340	Huh?
9146340	9148340	How can there be crocodiles in the sea?
9148340	9151340	I thought they only lived in fresh water.
9151340	9154340	How are we going to get back to the shore now?
9154340	9156340	We'll have to wait for a boat to come past.
9156340	9160340	No, I'm afraid we'll have to think of something else, Mama.
9160340	9163340	We could be waiting for a wink or something for that to happen.
9163340	9165340	A whole week!
9165340	9169340	But we'll starve. All they'll find is our bones bleached, waiting the sun.
9169340	9173340	Don't worry, little mind. Papa will think of something you'll see.
9173340	9175340	Good morning.
9177340	9179340	Snuffkin, what are you leaving?
9179340	9181340	I was going to go sea fishing.
9181340	9183340	But I changed my mind.
9183340	9187340	I didn't fancy landing a sea monster.
9192340	9197340	Help! Someone help! Help anybody!
9197340	9199340	That's Mr. Himmelin.
9199340	9203340	Oh, the tigers must be after him quickly.
9211340	9215340	I never made you so cross. I just told you not to eat my plants.
9215340	9221340	And please, someone anyone help!
9221340	9223340	Help!
9224340	9226340	Let me in!
9235340	9237340	That fella's always been clumsy.
9237340	9239340	We can't really help him.
9239340	9240340	No.
9246340	9247340	Are you alright, Himmelin?
9247340	9249340	Oh, dear, I think so.
9249340	9251340	What about him?
9251340	9254340	What do you do when a rhino gets stuck in your brando?
9254340	9256340	Oh, this is a new one, aren't we?
9256340	9258340	So I'm loose. I can't think of any other way.
9258340	9260340	You have to be very careful, though.
9260340	9262340	I think you're right.
9272340	9273340	Ah, look where you're going!
9273340	9276340	It was you who brought all the animals in, wasn't it?
9276340	9278340	Yes, you're right. That's what you wanted.
9278340	9281340	It's a jungle now. I did a good job.
9281340	9284340	Oh, really? Well, they're not wild animals at all.
9284340	9285340	They're quite friendly.
9285340	9287340	Friendly?
9309340	9311340	See what I mean? They make very good pets.
9311340	9313340	Cute, aren't they?
9320340	9323340	Snake! Go stick where are you?
9325340	9327340	What do you want?
9327340	9330340	The rhino and the tigers have become pets of the movement family.
9330340	9332340	You're not going to let that happen to you.
9332340	9333340	Well, are you?
9333340	9334340	It's not.
9334340	9337340	I'll bring snorked maiden and movement here tonight.
9337340	9341340	There's no need to eat all of them. Just bite off their tails, all right?
9341340	9343340	Okay.
9345340	9348340	You'll be really amazed, like I was.
9348340	9351340	It's big enough for both of you to sit on.
9351340	9353340	How lovely, a giant water lily.
9353340	9357340	I wonder if the seeds came from that box you all found.
9357340	9359340	Oh, I can't wait to see it.
9359340	9361340	Looking at the size of the jungle,
9361340	9364340	there must have been an awful lot of seeds in that box.
9364340	9367340	I suppose the wind could have blown them anywhere.
9369340	9371340	Where's the giant water lily?
9371340	9373340	Let's see now.
9374340	9376340	Over there.
9381340	9383340	How wonderful.
9383340	9386340	You see, I wish you'd learn to trust me.
9386340	9388340	I'm a very honest guy.
9390340	9393340	It's so soft and pink and beautiful.
9394340	9396340	Yeah.
9399340	9402340	How romantic to be on a boat made from a flower.
9402340	9404340	This is unbelievable.
9404340	9407340	Our old box seems to have grown into a tropical swamp.
9407340	9408340	It's a lot nicer.
9408340	9410340	Hey, stinky.
9410340	9412340	Stinky?
9412340	9413340	Oh.
9413340	9416340	I can't see him anywhere.
9418340	9420340	I wonder how far will float.
9420340	9423340	It's getting dark, Moomin.
9423340	9425340	Whoa!
9427340	9429340	Whoa!
9433340	9435340	Gotcha!
9435340	9437340	We must get away!
9437340	9439340	I don't know yet.
9439340	9441340	Look, there's the seed.
9441340	9443340	Put the crooked aisles.
9443340	9446340	Over there, start making a boat.
9446340	9450340	Well, it's the only way we'll get away from least monster.
9450340	9452340	Whoa!
9468340	9470340	Keep going, Snorkmaid.
9470340	9472340	We're almost there.
9474340	9476340	Wait.
9476340	9480340	Moomin and Snorkmaid kept swimming as fast as they could.
9480340	9483340	They had a head start on the snake, but now he was catching up.
9483340	9486340	Even though Moomin's are very good swimmers,
9486340	9490340	unfortunately for them, so are snakes.
9492340	9499340	They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.
9499340	9506340	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
9506340	9510340	They're always happy and always at play.
9510340	9514340	The movements are having fun day after day.
9514340	9517340	The movements.
9517340	9521340	The movements.
9521340	9528340	They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.
9529340	9536340	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
9536340	9540340	They're always happy and always at play.
9540340	9544340	The movements are having fun day after day.
9544340	9547340	The movements.
9547340	9551340	The movements.
9551340	9557340	The movements.
9559340	9563340	Here they are for one and all.
9563340	9566340	The movements are about to come.
9566340	9569340	Come on and sit down here with me.
9569340	9572340	They have for you on your TV.
9572340	9576340	They are the movements.
9576340	9579340	Here they are for one and all.
9579340	9582340	The movements are about to come.
9582340	9585340	Come on and sit down here with me.
9585340	9587340	Here for you on your TV.
9587340	9590340	They are the movements.
9590340	9593340	They are the movements.
9593340	9596340	So come with me, give me your hand.
9596340	9599340	I'll take you up to a moment land.
9599340	9602340	You can fly just like a bird.
9602340	9604340	Sing that song ever.
9604340	9607340	There were the movements.
9607340	9610340	There were the movements.
9610340	9613340	There were the movements.
9613340	9618340	There were the movements.
9618340	9622340	There were the movements.
9643340	9650340	The movements.
9650340	9657340	The movements.
9657340	9666340	The movements.
9666340	9668340	The movements.
9668340	9670340	Where are you moving?
9670340	9672340	It's not made in.
9672340	9676900	The rhino and the tigers that stinky set free from the zoo are now living in the jungle
9676900	9681940	that has grown up around Moomin house, and have settled into the restful life of Moomin Valley.
9684740	9686340	Hey, have you seen Moomin?
9686340	9688340	No, you haven't seen him all evening.
9690340	9692340	I wonder where they got to.
9694340	9699020	Meanwhile, Moomin and Snorkmaiden chased by the snake, are swimming as fast as they can
9699020	9700020	out to sea.
9702340	9703540	I can't swim another.
9703540	9705540	Snorkmaiden, you must!
9707940	9710740	Hey! Hey, you there!
9714740	9716740	Come on, Snorkmaiden, nearly there!
9717740	9721940	Look, there's a couple of hippos that come and towards us. We better get them on board.
9721940	9725940	That's funny. I haven't heard about any hippos reported missing from the zoo lately.
9727140	9729140	Just a bit further, Snorkmaiden.
9732740	9736740	We made it.
9736740	9740740	I didn't know hippos could climb so well.
9740740	9746740	Oh, thank you so much. There was a huge snake chasing us.
9746740	9749940	Yes, we saw you were lucky we came along when we did.
9749940	9752340	Thank you for your help. Who's ship is this?
9752340	9754340	Ours, we're from the zoo.
9754340	9758340	The zoo? Oh, you've got one of the crocodiles.
9758340	9760340	Yes, and a lot of trouble he gave us as well.
9761140	9764340	There's another one around here somewhere. We saw them.
9764340	9767140	Yes, we know there is, but we haven't been able to find him yet.
9767140	9771140	Oh, boy, I wish they'd come as quietly as you hippos did.
9771140	9773140	Hippos? Hippos?
9773140	9777140	Which zoo are you from? I bet they'd pay well to get you back.
9777140	9780340	Now, look here. I'm a Mormon, not a hippo.
9780340	9782340	Are you saying that I look like a hippo?
9782340	9785140	Well, perhaps they don't look exactly like hippos.
9785140	9787140	No, but they're close enough, Cam.
9787940	9790740	I'm sure they've escaped from the zoo somewhere, though.
9790740	9791540	Yes, sir.
9791540	9794740	We haven't escaped from anywhere, certainly not a zoo.
9794740	9797140	We live in Moomin Valley. We're Moomin's.
9797140	9799940	It's all right, Snork Maiden. I'll not be taken for a hippo.
9799940	9801540	Come on, let's run for it.
9801540	9805140	Hey, wait. There's a nice cozy cage already for you.
9805140	9806340	Hurry, Snork Maiden.
9806340	9808340	Ask to them.
9808340	9810340	Stop them now. Don't let them get away.
9811540	9813540	Where are we going, Moomin?
9813540	9815540	Now to the sea.
9817940	9820340	Quickly, man, lower the live boat.
9820340	9822340	They're not going to put us in any zoo.
9827540	9830740	Why did you come back? I thought you were on the boat.
9830740	9831540	Oh, no.
9831540	9834340	Don't worry. I never eat anything when I'm not swimming.
9834340	9836340	Are you sure?
9836340	9838340	I'm sure. Now where's this ship?
9839540	9841540	Oh, they're catching up with us.
9841540	9844340	They want to put us in a cage and take us to the zoo.
9844340	9847540	Me too, I expect. They're always trying to get me.
9847540	9848740	They've got one of the crocodiles.
9848740	9850900	Oh, did they? They were my friends.
9850900	9853060	Right. Hang on to me, you two.
9853060	9855540	I'm certainly not going back to any zoo.
9855540	9857540	Never, let's go.
9858740	9859540	Oh, no.
9859540	9861540	Hold on tight.
9863540	9866740	Come back, you horrible reptile. Come back.
9870340	9872340	Moomin's been caught by a big snake.
9872340	9875060	Yes, mama snorked maiden as well.
9875060	9877540	Dear stinky, that's not true, is it?
9877540	9880500	I wish people would realize that I almost never lie.
9880500	9883140	I'm sorry about them, but I thought I'd better tell you.
9883140	9886180	There aren't any snakes that big in Moomin Valley.
9886180	9887700	There are tigers here, aren't there?
9887700	9889140	Well, there's big snakes too.
9890020	9892100	You brought the snake here, didn't you?
9892100	9894980	Papa, I'm not saying that I believe him,
9894980	9898820	but I think we'd better look for them just to be on the safe side, don't you?
9898820	9902180	Okay, don't believe me. I told you so my conscience is clear.
9902180	9904740	Where exactly did the snake attack them, stinky?
9904740	9906740	Down in the swamp by the sea.
9906740	9907940	Let's go, mama.
9908820	9910100	I'll come with you.
9910100	9911780	No, you'd better stay little, my,
9911780	9914340	until Moomin, where we've gone, if he comes back,
9914340	9916980	he'll only worry if there's no one here.
9916980	9919700	And stinky, you'll show us where to go.
9919700	9920340	Okay.
9920420	9922020	Okay.
9928020	9931460	Oh, no.
9931460	9932580	Oh, no.
9932580	9932980	Oh, oh, no.
9932980	9934500	Hey, you!
9934500	9936660	Have you eaten Moomin and Snorkmaden?
9936660	9938980	It's alright, mama. We're here.
9938980	9940980	Oh, praise the boob, the boob, the boob.
9940980	9942220	Say...
9942220	9943220	Me time, you friend.
9943220	9944900	What a very big friend.
9944900	9947860	Please come in as much of you as you like.
9947860	9949940	Stinky just told us that you and Snorkmaden
9949940	9952480	They didn't been caught by a big snake, so we...
9952480	9954480	Where are you going, Stinky?
9955480	9957080	She did chase us at first.
9957080	9958580	Then we managed to get on a boat,
9958580	9960180	but they wanted to put us in a cage,
9960180	9962780	so we jumped back in the sea, met the snake again,
9962780	9964020	then they tried to catch her too,
9964020	9966680	so she helped us to get away, and now she's our friend.
9966680	9968180	Who are they?
9968180	9969620	Men from the zoo.
9969620	9971620	They've come to recapture all the animals
9971620	9973060	and take them away from the jungle
9973060	9974820	and put them in cages again.
9974820	9975820	Mm, nice.
9975820	9978260	Second, you don't want to go back in the zoo.
9978260	9980340	Papa, we've got to protect our friends.
9980340	9981860	Yes, we have.
9981860	9984300	I'm sure that the tigers and that nice rhino
9984300	9985500	don't want to go back even.
9985500	9987540	Oh, of course they don't.
9987540	9990340	They want to be free and live again, our jungle.
9990340	9991900	Why don't you go and explore it?
9991900	9993820	I'm sure it'll be just like home.
9993820	9995140	And if you see the zoo people,
9995140	9996900	you can come back here, can't you?
9997900	10000340	I'm sure you'll like it here, Mrs. Snake.
10000340	10002460	Yes, I'm sure I will.
10002460	10004460	Come on, I'll show you the jungle.
10004460	10005460	Eh!
10006460	10010460	I'm so relieved that you're both all right at home.
10010460	10014460	So are we, Mama, but there's something we haven't told you.
10014460	10017460	Yes, they thought we were hippopotamuses.
10017460	10018460	What?
10018460	10019460	Who did?
10019460	10021460	They need their eyes, Destiny.
10021460	10023460	The men from the zoo.
10023460	10025460	They thought we had escaped from another zoo
10025460	10028460	and were trying to catch us and they nearly succeeded.
10028460	10029460	Now, rude.
10029460	10032460	We're not at all like hippos, the cheek of it.
10033460	10036460	So these men were only trying to capture our new friends,
10036460	10038460	but you and Snork Maiden as well.
10038460	10040460	And me and Papa, if they'd known about us.
10040460	10041460	That's right, Mama.
10041460	10042460	They're idiots.
10042460	10045460	Hippopotamuses don't wear aprons or right memoirs.
10045460	10047460	That's really made me angry.
10047460	10050460	I bet they never faced the wrath of a movement Papa before.
10050460	10055460	I want to see you wrap yourself round and choke somebody.
10055460	10056460	I know.
10056460	10057460	How about the tiger?
10057460	10058460	He do.
10058460	10060460	I'd rather not.
10060460	10063460	We became friends in the zoo.
10063460	10064460	Oh, I know.
10064460	10065460	Choke stinky.
10065460	10066460	That'll be much better.
10066460	10072460	Yes, my dewey did let us out of the zoo.
10072460	10074460	Well, you're a great disappointment to me.
10074460	10077460	I let you out because I thought you'd attack the movements,
10077460	10078460	but you have tea with them instead.
10078460	10079460	You're pathetic.
10079460	10080460	You know that?
10080460	10083460	I'm sorry, but we were brought up in captivity
10083460	10085460	and we never had to hunt for our food.
10085460	10087460	All our meals are brought to us, you see.
10087460	10090460	But your tigers what do you eat them?
10090460	10093460	Well, we love cat food.
10093460	10094460	Cat food.
10094460	10097460	Oh, I don't believe it.
10097460	10101460	Yes, it's easy to chew and it leaves our fur all sleek and shiny.
10101460	10104460	We like the yellow tins with the black cat, don't we, honey?
10104460	10105460	Yes, it's our favorite.
10105460	10108460	You wouldn't happen to have any on you, would you?
10118460	10119460	Mama!
10119460	10121460	Papa, quickly!
10122460	10123460	They're here.
10123460	10125460	The zoo men are here.
10125460	10129460	Oh, get all the animals into the house first, you.
10129460	10131460	Hurry, moment.
10131460	10132460	Okay, Papa.
10135460	10137460	The zoo men have come to get you.
10137460	10138460	They're here.
10138460	10139460	The zoo men are here.
10139460	10142460	Oh, get all the animals into the house first.
10142460	10143460	Hurry, moment.
10143460	10144460	Okay, Papa.
10145460	10147460	The zoo men have come to get you.
10147460	10150460	Hurry, you'll be safe in the moment house.
10150460	10152460	Quick as you can, Rhino.
10152460	10153460	Into the house.
10153460	10154460	Go on.
10159460	10161460	Now, Rhino, push him.
10161460	10162460	I'm sorry.
10175460	10180460	Um, I don't think that's a good place to hide, Mrs. Snake.
10183460	10186460	I'm afraid that doesn't look quite right, Tiger.
10186460	10189460	I thought I might just look like a thick rug.
10189460	10192460	I'll just lie here like a beautiful porcelain ornament.
10192460	10195460	They'll never know we're here, darling.
10195460	10199460	Well, they'd never expect to find a Rhino under there.
10199460	10200460	That's what I thought.
10200460	10201460	Where are they?
10201460	10204460	They can't just have vanished into thin air.
10207460	10208460	Hmm.
10208460	10209460	Look.
10209460	10210460	Up there.
10211460	10212460	In the chimney.
10217460	10219460	So they're in there, are they?
10232460	10233460	Papa!
10235460	10238460	They've seen the snake. They're nearly here.
10241460	10244460	Now, I want you to calm down and be quiet, everyone.
10244460	10245460	We won't let them take you away.
10245460	10249460	I promise you they'll have a fight on the hands if they try.
10249460	10250460	Teeth, please, my love.
10250460	10251460	Of course, dear.
10262460	10263460	Hello.
10266460	10267460	Hello.
10268460	10269460	Hello.
10270460	10271460	Hello.
10277460	10279460	Hello, having a picnic, are you?
10279460	10280460	It's lovely day for you.
10280460	10281460	Not at all.
10281460	10283460	We're all here from the zoo, sir.
10283460	10285460	Oh, are you on some sort of expedition?
10285460	10288460	Excuse me, but are you the owner of this house?
10288460	10291460	Yes, indeed, I am. I'm moving Papa.
10291460	10293460	Well, what can I do for you?
10293460	10295460	Well, you could send out the animals hiding in your house.
10295460	10297460	That'll do for a start.
10297460	10298460	Animals?
10298460	10299460	Oh, no.
10299460	10302460	We have firm believers that they belong outside.
10302460	10306460	Sir, you can't see from where you are, but I can assure you that there is a python
10306460	10308460	sticking its head out of your chimney.
10308460	10309460	A python?
10309460	10311460	Yes, that's right.
10311460	10313460	No, it isn't.
10313460	10314460	It isn't.
10314460	10316460	No, it's my daughter.
10316460	10318460	She happens to look like a python.
10318460	10321460	Not all the time you understand.
10321460	10323460	Right, come on, man.
10323460	10325460	We'll go and get the zoo's property.
10325460	10327460	No, you will not enter my house.
10327460	10329460	All right, well, you let the animals out.
10329460	10330460	We won't have to.
10330460	10331460	It's up to you, sir.
10331460	10334460	There are no animals, and you won't enter my house.
10334460	10335460	Now, wait a minute.
10335460	10336460	I do believe, yes.
10336460	10339460	You're one of those hippos, aren't you?
10339460	10340460	I am not.
10340460	10343460	I'm moving Papa, and I am the owner of this house.
10343460	10344460	No, you're not.
10344460	10345460	You're a hippopotamus.
10345460	10346460	How did?
10346460	10350460	A hippo who owns a house, and it's also running in an illegal zoo.
10350460	10352460	Break down the doors.
10352460	10354460	That is against the law.
10354460	10355460	Oh, it is, isn't?
10355460	10359460	Well, there's a nice cage winning for you as well, woman Papa, hippo.
10359460	10363460	I warn you, if you touch that door, you'll regret it.
10363460	10364460	Go, yeah?
10366460	10367460	Great boys.
10367460	10368460	Let's go in.
10368460	10369460	Charge!
10374460	10375460	Ah!
10375460	10376460	Ah!
10376460	10377460	Ah!
10377460	10378460	Ah!
10378460	10379460	Ah!
10379460	10380460	Ah!
10380460	10381460	Ah!
10381460	10382460	Ah!
10382460	10383460	Ah!
10383460	10384460	Ah!
10384460	10385460	Ah!
10385460	10386460	Ah!
10386460	10387460	Ah!
10387460	10388460	Ah!
10388460	10390460	Ah!
10390460	10391460	Ah!
10391460	10392460	Ah!
10392460	10394460	Now then, what's going on?
10394460	10396460	Little Mike brought the inspector.
10396460	10399460	All right, what do you men think you're doing?
10399460	10402460	Ah, there are high animals from the zoo in this house.
10402460	10403460	We want them back.
10403460	10406460	I tried to reason with the hippo, but it was no good.
10406460	10410460	Oh, have you know that's willful destruction of property, my good man?
10410460	10411460	It's not.
10411460	10412460	Well, for we're from the zoo.
10412460	10413460	We got to get in somehow.
10413460	10418460	Oh, have you, and can you be sure that there are zoo animals in there?
10418460	10420460	You just take a look up there at the chimney.
10420460	10422460	That's all I'm sure.
10422460	10424460	Go on.
10424460	10427460	See that python's head sticking out?
10427460	10429460	That's all.
10429460	10431460	I can't see a python's head.
10431460	10433460	There was a python's head up there.
10433460	10434460	I saw it.
10434460	10437460	Ugh, I can't breathe.
10437460	10440460	Now you listen to me, zoo man.
10440460	10441460	Huh?
10441460	10444460	Either you stop bothering my friends or I'll arrest you.
10444460	10445460	Is that clear?
10445460	10446460	Well, is it?
10446460	10447460	Yes, sir, it is.
10447460	10449460	But what about the zoo animals?
10449460	10451460	You heard the inspector.
10451460	10452460	Now go away.
10452460	10453460	Do you see that?
10453460	10454460	See what?
10454460	10455460	The hippopotamus.
10455460	10456460	What?
10456460	10457460	The hippopotamus.
10457460	10459460	He's a fellow's been hiding all our zoo animals.
10459460	10461460	A nice cage lined up for him as well, inspector.
10461460	10463460	Oh, so that's your plan, is it?
10463460	10465460	Ha, they want to take them all.
10465460	10467460	Moomin's, Norkman, Mama, and Papa.
10467460	10469460	Hmm, the criminal conspiracy.
10469460	10470460	Conspiracy?
10470460	10473460	It would probably be called kidnapping.
10473460	10475460	Once you can't kidnap a hippo.
10475460	10477460	That's a movement.
10477460	10479460	It could be white slavery, though.
10479460	10482460	I'm sure I could add incitement to riot to the list.
10482460	10485460	Now I hate paperwork, so I'll tell you one.
10485460	10487460	If you're gone within 10 minutes, I won't arrest you.
10487460	10490460	Why don't you put them in the deepest dungeon, inspector?
10490460	10492460	The one with all the rats and spiders and scorpions
10492460	10494460	that'll teach them to put Moomin's encages.
10494460	10496460	That's a good idea, little mind.
10496460	10498460	They like animals.
10498460	10501460	I'll start counting now.
10501460	10504460	One, two, three.
10504460	10505460	Get around, men.
10505460	10506460	Quickly.
10506460	10507460	All right.
10507460	10509460	We'll have to think quickly on this one, men.
10509460	10510460	Come on now.
10510460	10512460	Does anybody have any smart ideas?
10512460	10513460	Come on.
10513460	10516460	We're running out of time.
10516460	10517460	One minute.
10517460	10519460	Look, guys, we're going to figure something out right now.
10519460	10520460	Ready and look.
10520460	10523460	One minute, 30 seconds.
10523460	10524460	Two minutes.
10524460	10526460	Three minutes, 30 seconds.
10526460	10527460	Look.
10527460	10528460	Leave us alone.
10528460	10529460	Way we're conferring.
10529460	10530460	All right.
10530460	10532460	Six minutes and 50 seconds.
10532460	10533460	Time's up.
10533460	10534460	You're cheating.
10534460	10535460	The police don't cheat.
10535460	10537460	And now you've got...
10537460	10539460	Nine minutes and 30 seconds.
10539460	10540460	How about that?
10540460	10541460	Nine minutes, 50 bucks.
10541460	10542460	I give up.
10542460	10544460	Everybody beat it.
10544460	10545460	But we're still discussing it.
10545460	10546460	No, we're not.
10546460	10547460	We're getting out.
10547460	10548460	Look, everyone.
10548460	10549460	The zoom in.
10549460	10551460	We're running off.
10551460	10552460	Great.
10552460	10555460	You've got to come and see this, Mama.
10555460	10557460	Nine minutes and 50 and a half seconds.
10557460	10558460	And don't come back.
10558460	10560460	We'll be the dungeon for you.
10560460	10563460	And I make that 10 minutes up to you.
10563460	10564460	You saved his little mind.
10564460	10567460	It was really clever of you to fetch the inspector.
10567460	10570460	Well, there were too many of them for me to fight.
10570460	10571460	Okay.
10571460	10572460	Everyone.
10573460	10575460	Help!
10575460	10578460	Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
10578460	10580460	And so everyone was saved.
10580460	10582460	And eventually, they all came out of the house
10582460	10584460	to go and have fun in the jungle again.
10584460	10586460	As long as the warm weather lasted,
10586460	10588460	there were plenty of things to do.
10588460	10590460	But one day, the weather changed.
10590460	10593460	And cold winds blew down Moomin Valley.
10595460	10598460	Oh, it feels like autumn has arrived.
10598460	10600460	The jungle won't like the cold weather.
10601460	10603460	Do you think it will die, Mama?
10603460	10605460	I'm afraid it will, little mind.
10605460	10609460	It grew very quickly, so perhaps it will go the same way.
10611460	10612460	And it did.
10612460	10616460	The whole jungle with it and died in just one night.
10622460	10624460	I think I've done a cold coming, Mama.
10624460	10625460	I'm sorry.
10625460	10626460	I can't get the house any hotter.
10626460	10627460	I missed the zoo.
10627460	10629460	At least it was warm now.
10629460	10631460	Yes, this cold is awful.
10631460	10634460	It would warm them up if we burned the dead jungle.
10651460	10652460	Now they're happy again.
10652460	10653460	But for how long?
10660460	10662460	Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys.
10662460	10663460	It's cold again.
10663460	10665460	It was warm in our cages.
10665460	10667460	But you're free here.
10667460	10669460	Yes, free to have pneumonia.
10669460	10673460	I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spanning the winter here.
10673460	10677460	Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys.
10677460	10678460	It's cold again.
10678460	10680460	It was warm in our cages.
10680460	10682460	What are you afraid here?
10682460	10684460	Yes, free to have pneumonia.
10684460	10688460	I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spanning the winter here.
10690460	10694460	And so all the animals decided to return to the zoo.
10694460	10697460	Perhaps we'll let you come back next summer, Mrs. Snake.
10697460	10700460	I like that when it's warmer.
10704460	10707460	Hey, look, the animals are on their way back.
10707460	10709460	All right.
10709460	10710460	That wonderful.
10710460	10712460	Oh, it's good to see you.
10712460	10714460	You don't know how much we missed you.
10714460	10716460	Oh, good.
10716460	10717460	Gosh.
10717460	10719460	It's good to see you.
10719460	10720460	Come on now.
10720460	10721460	Get back to your cages quickly.
10721460	10723460	We've been keeping them nice and warm for you.
10723460	10725460	Go on, off you go now.
10725460	10728460	You look all right, but I'm sure you must all be starving.
10728460	10731460	We'll do you a special meal tonight.
10731460	10732460	All right.
10732460	10734460	Ah, the hippos too.
10734460	10736460	For the last time, we're moments, not hippos.
10736460	10737460	You must be cold as well.
10737460	10739460	We'll warm up a cage for you.
10739460	10741460	It'll be nice and cozy there.
10741460	10742460	No.
10742460	10744460	No, it just came to send the animals off.
10744460	10746460	Hey, get a cage ready for the hippos.
10746460	10747460	Will you?
10747460	10748460	Nice and warm.
10748460	10750460	At the risk of sounding repetitive.
10750460	10751460	We are moments.
10751460	10752460	Don't be ridiculous.
10752460	10754460	We'll let it here.
10754460	10756460	But we're nothing like hippos.
10756460	10760460	We know you're not pure breads, but the public will never be able to tell.
10765460	10768460	Do we have to stay here forever, Papa?
10768460	10769460	Of course not, moment.
10769460	10770460	Don't worry.
10770460	10771460	I'll think of something.
10771460	10772460	You will, won't you?
10772460	10774460	Have you got any ideas?
10774460	10778460	Well, not yet, but I am a writer, you know.
10782460	10784460	Don't cry, Snorth Maiden.
10784460	10787460	I'm sure there won't be only hay to eat.
10787460	10789460	I don't mind as long as we're together.
10789460	10792460	But what if they put us in separate cages?
10792460	10793460	No.
10793460	10794460	That would be awful.
10794460	10796460	They wouldn't do that.
10797460	10800460	Well, perhaps the inspector will come looking for us.
10800460	10803460	When he realizes that we've gone as well as the animals,
10803460	10806460	he'll bring the full power of the Lord to bear on them.
10806460	10807460	Oh, look.
10807460	10808460	There's someone coming.
10808460	10809460	It's Snorthkin.
10809460	10810460	And Hamilun.
10810460	10811460	And a little Mai.
10811460	10812460	Snorthkin.
10815460	10816460	Hi, movement.
10816460	10817460	Don't worry.
10817460	10820460	We'll have you guys out in just a minute.
10823460	10824460	Please come out.
10827460	10830460	Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to let you out.
10830460	10832460	I'm in charge of this zoo.
10832460	10834460	I'm afraid it was quite an understandable mistake.
10834460	10838460	But please accept this token of apology from the board of trustees.
10838460	10839460	Here you are, madam.
10840460	10843460	Mr. Hamilun and I went to the Royal Academy of Science
10843460	10845460	just to sort all this out.
10845460	10847460	We've been given a letter from the President
10847460	10849460	stating that you are not hippos.
10849460	10852460	Mr. Hamilun's scientific background helped persuade him.
10852460	10854460	So you can all come home now.
10855460	10859460	Well, it just goes to show you must never judge by appearances alone.
10862460	10863460	Mama.
10863460	10864460	Yes, Papa.
10864460	10867460	Do you think I should grow a beard?
10867460	10868460	No, Papa.
10875460	10878460	And so autumn came to Moomin Valley.
10878460	10882460	A new season with different weather and different pleasures.
10914460	10917460	The Moomin's.
10917460	10922460	They love the laughter and they love the living.
10922460	10925460	The Moomin's.
10925460	10933460	You're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.
10933460	10937460	They're always happy and goes at play.
10937460	10940460	The Moomin's are having fun day after day.
10940460	10944460	The Moomin's.
10944460	10947460	The Moomin's.
10947460	10954460	The Moomin's.
10971460	10976460	Here they are for one and all.
10976460	10979460	The Moomin's are about to come.
10979460	10982460	Come on and sit down here with me.
10982460	10984460	Therefore you want your TV.
10984460	10987460	They are the Moomin's.
10987460	10990460	They are the Moomin's.
10990460	10993460	So come with me, give me your hand.
10993460	10996460	I'll take you up to a Moomin land.
10996460	10999460	You can fly just like a bird.
10999460	11001460	Sing that song ever.
11001460	11004460	There was the Moomin's.
11004460	11009460	There was the Moomin's.
11009460	11012460	There was the Moomin's.
11012460	11017460	There was the Moomin's.
11017460	11020460	There was the Moomin's.
11020460	11050460	Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
11050460	11080460	Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
11080460	11083180	Oh, I'm just taking my brother his lunch little my
11083180	11087020	Hmm. He must have nearly finished the flying ship by now
11087020	11089980	Oh, no. Not even snork works that quickly
11091500	11095980	Well, have you seen it? No, I haven't. He won't even let me come into his workshop
11095980	11098140	Is he afraid it'll disappear if someone sees it?
11098700	11102940	He hasn't said why but I suppose all great inventors have to be very careful
11102940	11104940	Someone might want to steal their ideas
11105820	11107820	Moment told me he's dying to have a look at it
11119260	11123420	A moment open the door. I've got my hands fall. Come on quickly
11124940	11127340	Look what I've got. It's a runner player
11135740	11142540	Do you think you can get it working, do you? Oh, yes, of course, Mama
11142540	11147660	Why did people always give me things that are broken? It'd be nice to have something that worked for a change
11151180	11153260	Moment, Papa will get it working for you
11153900	11159900	My auntie said that the record was all right though. It's dance music. She's had it for ages, but I've never heard it
11159900	11164060	Oh, that's nice. It's years since I danced but it seems like only yesterday
11164540	11170780	Do you remember what funny was papa dancing? Oh, oh, yeah, I see
11171660	11173660	Have you fixed it papa?
11181740	11185260	Huh, I can hear music doesn't sound like snuffkin
11194860	11196860	Oh
11214540	11218380	Right have you got the idea now? Yes, I think so
11219180	11220940	Me too
11220940	11223420	Come on. Well, let's see you then
11226060	11228060	Meal?
11228860	11230860	Did it
11231900	11233900	Oh, wow
11240620	11243580	Look at papa moving. He's a great dancer
11244220	11246220	Oh
11253740	11258300	Well, then can you dance sniff I've never tried right. Well tried now
11267500	11269500	Yep
11273580	11274580	One day...
11274580	11282120	Пол is there it's quite quick!
11282120	11290580	Oh that was fun...
11290580	11296180	Uh Dad, Saint Neofer, you still have me out like this?
11296180	11298380	You've got no sense of rhythm at all, sneak!
11298380	11302840	I can still dance though can I?
11302840	11304280	Oh, are you ready, Papa?
11304280	11306380	Well, I think I'll have to sit this one out, Mama.
11306380	11307220	All right.
11311400	11313080	No, Mom, no, thank you.
11313080	11314160	I'll dance on my own.
11314160	11314960	Well, then.
11314960	11317160	Why don't you dance with me and dance, Smith?
11317160	11318000	Ah.
11318000	11335640	Oh, it looks like it's here for the day.
11335640	11347280	Oh, what horrible weather, Snuffkin.
11347280	11349160	Yes.
11349160	11350760	They're having fun.
11350760	11354480	Well, Smith brought this old record player over, and we've been dancing.
11354480	11356400	I haven't done it for years and years.
11356400	11358040	And, well, aren't you coming in?
11358040	11360600	I can smell winter in the air, Moomin, Papa.
11360600	11362640	Huh?
11362640	11364640	Oh, yes, you're right.
11371840	11373240	Snuffkin, hi.
11378280	11381000	Snuffkin, come and dance with me.
11381000	11382600	No, thanks, I'm fine.
11382600	11389600	Sorry.
11389600	11391400	I'm sorry.
11391400	11399400	Oh, you.
11399400	11407200	Hmm, what's the matter with this, huh?
11407200	11408480	I'm afraid it's broken.
11408480	11410360	Just when we were having so much fun.
11410360	11412920	Will you be able to fix it again, dear?
11412920	11414880	No, even I can't mend it now.
11414880	11417320	Oh, please, try, Papa, will you?
11417320	11421960	Hmm, Snuffkin, do you know anything about record players?
11421960	11423120	No, I'm afraid not.
11423120	11424080	Oh, dear.
11424080	11425560	But what?
11425560	11428120	I'll play my harmonic if you want to continue to dance,
11428120	11430040	and then you can fiddle around with the machine.
11430040	11431240	How would that be?
11431240	11432520	Oh, yes, please.
11432520	11434040	That'd be great, Snuffkin.
11434040	11435320	Thanks.
11435320	11437600	Now then, what would be a good tune to dance to?
11437600	11438360	Let's see.
11465320	11477400	Now what's this, oh, oh, oh, no, I give up.
11477400	11480640	May I?
11480640	11503960	You're thinking about going away again, aren't you, Snuffkin?
11503960	11504960	Hmm.
11504960	11509440	I know that you go south every year when winter comes, but I'll still miss you, though,
11509440	11512640	and I wish you could stay here in Moomin Valley.
11512640	11516440	I know, Moomin.
11516440	11524000	Who are they?
11524000	11525240	How do you fathomers, I think?
11525240	11527240	I wonder where they're going.
11527240	11528240	I don't know.
11528240	11531240	A deserted island, I expect.
11531240	11534960	Probably the best place for them.
11534960	11536960	When are you leaving, Snuffkin?
11536960	11539120	Oh, I haven't decided yet.
11539120	11542720	So you'll be here for a bit longer, then.
11542720	11544880	Do you know where you're going?
11544880	11545880	No.
11545880	11547720	It must be fun traveling.
11547720	11550720	Yes, most of the time.
11550720	11554120	It's the best way of meeting new people and still being on your own.
11554120	11558760	I wish we could do that, but even when we hibernate and go to sleep, we're never really
11558760	11559760	alone.
11559760	11563560	I guess I'd hibernate too if I had to stay up here in Moomin, during all the freezing
11563560	11570840	winter snows.
11570840	11578720	Do you think I could go south with Snuffkin, Papa?
11578720	11579720	Not really.
11579720	11582720	It's the moment way to hibernate.
11582720	11587080	It's a family custom passed down through the years by our ancestors.
11587080	11589840	But Papa, I don't want to go to sleep for months on end.
11589840	11592240	I want to travel south with Snuffkin.
11592280	11597320	Oh, Moomin, you promise you'll be back on the first day of spring.
11597320	11598520	Oh, Mama!
11598520	11601440	Does that mean I can really go?
11601440	11603280	I can't wait to tell Snuffkin.
11603280	11604760	I can, can't I?
11604760	11608080	Well, if you really want to, I don't suppose we'll stop you.
11608080	11610280	Will we, Papa?
11610280	11613880	Now, my parents didn't mind when I traveled around in my youth.
11613880	11615880	So yes, all right, Moomin.
11615880	11617480	Oh, thank you, Mama.
11617480	11620360	Oh, thank you, Mama.
11620360	11622600	That's great, but why won't Snuffkin say?
11630080	11632280	Well, it's a good idea.
11632280	11635120	And I got to say it'd be fun to have you along, Moomin.
11635120	11638520	So I can come with you, Snuffkin?
11638520	11639480	No.
11639480	11640560	What?
11640560	11643720	I'm sorry, but I've got to go on my own.
11643720	11645000	Don't be disappointed, Moomin.
11645000	11647080	I told you I travel alone.
11647080	11648040	I need to.
11648040	11649680	After spending the rest of the year here,
11649680	11652640	just as I need to be here, after spending the winter alone,
11652640	11654640	and the joy of returning to Moomin Valley
11654640	11656080	is something I wouldn't miss.
11656080	11658360	Which Snuffkin, I thought.
11658360	11660160	The time will soon pass, and you'll
11660160	11662120	be asleep through most of it.
11662120	11663760	You won't notice I'm not here.
11663760	11666720	I'll see you next spring, Moomin.
11666720	11668800	I'll be back on the first day as usual.
11668800	11671600	I promise, as soon as the weather warns.
11671600	11673520	And when the flowers start to grow, nothing
11673520	11675000	will keep me from Moomin Valley.
11678560	11681880	I'm sorry, I didn't work out for you, Moomin.
11681880	11683320	Oh, it's all right.
11683320	11685760	Oh, come on, Moomin.
11685760	11687480	You'll have to tie them a bit tighter than that.
11708520	11711280	It'll be a cold winter, so we'll need lots of wood
11711280	11713320	to keep us going till spring comes.
11713320	11714000	I know.
11714000	11717440	Now you want to stay warm, don't you?
11717440	11720720	When I grow up, I'll go south for my own, too.
11720720	11722560	Yes, of course you will.
11739040	11741960	It's Moomin home.
11741960	11743920	Yes?
11743920	11745080	How is he?
11745080	11746960	Is he still down in the dumps?
11746960	11747920	I'm afraid so.
11747920	11750440	Grandma's cheer you up recipe didn't work.
11750440	11753960	Oh, I think he's being silly just because Snuffkin's
11753960	11754640	going away.
11754640	11756440	I suppose he is.
11756440	11758920	But don't worry, Mama.
11758920	11760600	He won't be miserable much longer,
11760600	11762400	because I've got a surprise for him.
11768040	11775040	Are you there, Moomin?
11775040	11777040	Oh, Moomin, don't cry.
11777040	11779040	Boys don't cry, I suppose.
11779040	11780040	Of course they do.
11780040	11782040	Well, I'm not crying, so they're...
11782040	11783040	All right.
11783040	11785040	But I do think you should get up now.
11785040	11787040	Oh, and why should I?
11787040	11789040	I have a surprise for you.
11789040	11791040	I don't want any surprises.
11791040	11793040	Oh, Moomin, don't cry.
11793040	11795040	Boys don't cry, I suppose.
11795040	11796040	Of course they do.
11796040	11797040	Well, I'm not crying, so they're...
11797040	11798040	They don't want any surprises.
11798040	11802040	Come on, I'm going to go and see Snuffkin his workshop.
11802040	11804040	But you know he won't let us in.
11804040	11805040	I've tried before.
11805040	11806040	Oh, yes.
11806040	11807040	He will today.
11807040	11808040	I promise.
11808040	11809040	What?
11809040	11812040	You mean Snuffkin shows his flying ship a glass?
11812040	11813040	Yes, he says.
11813040	11815040	Has he really finished it then?
11815040	11817040	No, not yet.
11817040	11819040	There's still a lot of work to do on it.
11819040	11821040	Then I wonder why he's letting us see it.
11821040	11823040	He's always refused before.
11823040	11825040	What's made him change his mind?
11825040	11827040	But I asked him this time.
11827040	11829040	I said I wanted to show it to you.
11829040	11830040	It just needed a woman's touch.
11830040	11832040	What did you say to him?
11832040	11834040	First he said absolutely not.
11834040	11836040	But when I told him how ill you were in that
11836040	11838040	you probably wouldn't be with us much longer.
11838040	11840040	He gave in and said we could see it.
11840040	11841040	Just you and me of course.
11841040	11843040	I'm not that ill snorke maiden.
11843040	11844040	Oh good.
11844040	11846040	Because sometimes when people are very depressed
11846040	11849040	and just lying bad, they've done something bad.
11849040	11852040	Oh stop it snorke maiden, don't say things like that.
11856040	11858040	I'm only trying to cheer you up.
11858040	11860040	So remember, don't tell us all.
11860040	11862040	No one else must know anything about it.
11862040	11863040	Okay.
11871040	11872040	Let's go.
11873040	11874040	No.
11878040	11879040	Oh little my.
11879040	11880040	Little my.
11880040	11881040	Trouble.
11881040	11882040	Big Trouble.
11882040	11883040	We must fool her.
11883040	11884040	Yes but how?
11884040	11885040	What can we do?
11886040	11888040	I know what we'll do.
11888040	11889040	What?
11889040	11890040	Quick movement.
11890040	11893040	You just agree with everything I say snorke maiden.
11893040	11894040	Oh.
11894040	11897040	I know what we'll do.
11897040	11898040	Quick movement.
11898040	11901040	You just agree with everything I say snorke maiden.
11901040	11902040	Oh.
11902040	11905040	I thought you were in bad movement.
11905040	11906040	No.
11906040	11907040	We're going to see snorke.
11907040	11908040	Yes.
11908040	11909040	Really?
11909040	11910040	Yes.
11910040	11912040	She needs to clear a runway for when the flying ship is finished.
11912040	11913040	We're going to help him do it.
11913040	11914040	That's all.
11914040	11915040	Yes.
11915040	11916040	Are you really moving?
11916040	11918040	You got out of bed to do that.
11918040	11921040	I'm afraid I find it very strange that snorke is asked to go along
11921040	11924040	and help him cut down bushes and dig up roots and things.
11924040	11927040	You might have noticed I'm not a complete fool.
11927040	11928040	But it's true little my.
11928040	11929040	Oh, yes.
11929040	11931040	Well, at least you could have invented a better lie.
11931040	11936040	You must think I'm pretty stupid to believe a pathetic story like that.
11936040	11937040	But it's the truth.
11937040	11939040	And we need your help.
11939040	11940040	Yeah.
11940040	11941040	Don't bother, don't bother.
11941040	11942040	I don't want to hear anymore.
11942040	11945040	I think it's very sad that you have to pretend.
11945040	11947040	You're trying to hide something from me.
11947040	11950040	And I'm not interested in what sort of sneaky underhanded thing it is.
11950040	11951040	But little my.
11951040	11952040	No buts.
11952040	11956040	And anyway, I'm a little too busy at the moment to take any notice of what's going on.
11956040	11957040	Bye.
11957040	11958040	Come on.
11958040	11959040	Phew.
11959040	11960040	That was close.
11960040	11961040	Yeah.
11961040	11962040	Ha.
11962040	11963040	Think, thank you.
11963040	11966040	Keep a secret from me, do they?
11966040	11967040	Ha.
11967040	11968040	Ha.
11968040	11969040	Ha.
11969040	11970040	Ha.
11970040	11971040	Think, thank you.
11971040	11973040	Keep a secret from me, do they?
11973040	11974040	Ha.
11974040	11975040	Ha.
11975040	11976040	Ha.
11976040	11977040	Ha.
11977040	11978040	Ha.
11978040	11979040	Ha.
11979040	11980040	Ha.
11980040	11981040	Ha.
11981040	11982040	Ha.
11982040	11983040	Ha.
11983040	11984040	Ha.
11984040	11985040	Ha.
11985040	11986040	Of course we are.
11986040	11989040	I promised, didn't I?
11989040	11992040	Come in, then.
11992040	11999040	Wow.
11999040	12008040	It's nearly ready, isn't it?
12008040	12010040	Oh no, there's a lot more to do.
12010040	12012040	The machine isn't half finished yet.
12012040	12019040	And as you can see, there's a lot to do on the ship itself, but I'm getting there slowly.
12019040	12023040	I never thought it would be so fantastic, smork.
12023040	12028040	Well, I suppose you could say the design wasn't a complete failure.
12028040	12031040	I'm quite sure it'll fly beautifully.
12031040	12032040	Oh, thank you.
12032040	12035040	Do you really think it will, woman?
12035040	12036040	I can see it now.
12036040	12041040	High up in the air, dodging in and out of the clouds, way up above the world.
12041040	12045040	Well, I'm glad to see that you're so perceptive and quite right.
12045040	12047040	Oh, how very thoughtful of me.
12047040	12049040	Shouldn't you sit down and rest?
12049040	12050040	You know, you're illness.
12050040	12052040	It doesn't help to get too excited.
12052040	12053040	Ha.
12053040	12054040	I shouldn't worry, Snork.
12054040	12056040	There's nothing wrong with him.
12056040	12059040	Oh, little my.
12059040	12060040	How did you get in here?
12060040	12062040	Throw that door.
12062040	12063040	But I always keep it.
12063040	12066040	Oh, oh, oh, no.
12066040	12069040	I must have forgotten to lock it.
12069040	12072040	And it's a bit late to do it now, isn't it?
12072040	12073040	But don't worry.
12073040	12076040	If I wanted to get in, I'd get in locks or no locks.
12076040	12078040	Oh, you lied to us, little my.
12078040	12079040	Of course, but so did you.
12079040	12081040	Telling me that stupid story.
12081040	12083040	Now we're even, right?
12083040	12085040	Now, listen, little my.
12085040	12087040	Don't ever tell anybody what you see over here.
12087040	12089040	All right.
12089040	12091040	Ha.
12091040	12098040	This invention contains so many outstanding new features it is difficult to know where to begin.
12099040	12108040	But let me start with the most exciting part of the whole construction.
12108040	12118040	It began as a dream or rather the concept of a dream, thrilling, beautiful, impossible, dangerous.
12129040	12131040	Oh.
12143040	12145040	Can you take the ship down, movement?
12145040	12148040	I'd like you to land at that side of the lake.
12148040	12150040	Oh, why do you want to get off?
12150040	12153040	Aren't you having fun flying about up here?
12153040	12155040	I want to be on my own.
12155040	12157040	Oh, please stay here.
12157040	12159040	I'll let you steer if you want.
12159040	12161040	No, really, movement, please.
12161040	12163040	Bye now.
12163040	12165040	No!
12168040	12171040	Snuff me!
12174040	12176040	Ugh!
12188040	12190040	So long then, movement, my friend.
12190040	12192040	I'll see you again next year.
12192040	12195040	The first day of spring.
12218040	12221040	Goodbye, then, Snuffkin.
12242040	12244040	Off for the winter, Asian Afghan.
12244040	12245040	Yes.
12245040	12246040	Goodbye, Mr. Hemilan.
12246040	12249040	We'll be seeing you in the spring.
12249040	12252040	Yes, when the snows are gone.
12258040	12262040	Oh, to be young and follow the sun wherever it goes.
12262040	12265040	And so the snow fell, and winter came to movement valley.
12265040	12268040	And in movement's hearts, Snuffkin and the spring
12268040	12271040	seemed a long, long way away.
12271040	12276040	They loved the laughter, and they loved the living,
12276040	12278040	the woman.
12278040	12281040	And so the snow fell, and winter came to movement valley.
12281040	12284040	And in movement's hearts, Snuffkin and the spring
12284040	12287040	seemed a long, long way away.
12287040	12290040	They loved the laughter, and they loved the living,
12290040	12293040	the woman.
12293040	12297040	Believing in sharing and caring and giving,
12297040	12301040	the woman.
12301040	12305040	They're always happy, and always at play.
12305040	12308040	The women are having fun day after day.
12308040	12312040	The woman.
12312040	12316040	The woman.
12316040	12319040	They loved the laughter, and they loved the living,
12319040	12323040	the woman.
12323040	12327040	Believing in sharing and caring and giving,
12327040	12331040	the woman.
12331040	12334040	They're always happy, and always at play.
12334040	12338040	The women are having fun day after day.
12338040	12342040	The woman.
12342040	12345040	The woman.
12345040	12352040	The woman.
12370040	12373040	Here they are for one another.
12373040	12376040	The movements are about to come.
12376040	12379040	Come on and sit down here with me.
12379040	12382040	Here for you on your TV.
12382040	12385040	They are the movements.
12385040	12388040	They are the movements.
12388040	12391040	So come with me, give me your hand.
12391040	12394040	I'll take you up to a moment land.
12394040	12397040	You can fly just like a bird.
12397040	12399040	Sing that song ever.
12399040	12402040	There were the movements.
12402040	12409040	There were the movements.
12409040	12416040	There were the movements.
12416040	12446040	Bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat

12476040	12481120	on everything, waiting until they all wake up again at the first day of spring and start
12481120	12488080	to get everything in movement house clean and ready for the coming summer.
12488080	12499040	But what's this?
12499040	12502920	It looks like movement as restless as if something has disturbed him.
12502920	12512440	I wonder what he was dreaming about.
12512440	12517680	I wonder what time it is.
12517680	12521320	Oh, it's nearly 20 after two.
12521320	12524600	Wonder whether it's morning or afternoon.
12524600	12526720	It doesn't really matter, I suppose.
12526720	12527720	Oh, it stopped.
12533320	12535800	Oh, it's frozen.
12535800	12539920	It looks really dark out there.
12553320	12557520	Mama, Mama, please wake up.
12557520	12566160	Papa, Papa, Mama, Mama, Mama, what's wrong with me?
12566160	12568160	I feel way too weak.
12568160	12592160	It's very odd, I don't usually wake up when I'm hibernating.
12592160	12607160	Oh, dear, the whole house is buried in snow.
12607160	12637160	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
12637160	12648040	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
12667160	12682760	what was that perhaps I better go home no what's the matter with me everyone's
12682760	12688160	asleep and the furniture's all covered up and movements don't give up
12697160	12705080	I wish Northkin were here he's probably in the far south where it's warm and
12705080	12707400	sunny
12728160	12732160	I wonder what that is
12732160	12734160	oh
12754060	12756960	that sounds like
12756960	12761200	Oh, he has his little mind.
12761200	12764240	By the bobo, what are you doing here, Moomin?
12764240	12765760	What am I doing here?
12765760	12770440	I heard strange noises and came to see what it was, then you crashed into me like an avalanche
12770440	12772360	and I've just lifted the box off you.
12772360	12773960	Oh, don't be stupid, Moomin.
12773960	12777600	I mean, why are you out in the snow and not hibernating like the others?
12777600	12778960	Spring's not for ages.
12778960	12780680	Oh, I don't know.
12780680	12783240	I just woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.
12783320	12787160	What about you, sliding about like that, you should be asleep too.
12787160	12789560	Yes, I should, but I just woke up as well.
12789560	12791000	Probably to look after you.
12791000	12794200	I tried to wake my stupid sister, but she kept on snoring.
12794200	12796520	But I think this snow is really great.
12796520	12797800	Well, I don't.
12797800	12803160	It's cold, it's slippy, much too bright, and it's everywhere and far too quiet.
12803160	12804920	I saw the grok.
12804920	12806280	Huh?
12806280	12808840	That horrible freezing monster?
12808840	12812920	She should feel at home in this and there's no point in her trying to freeze anything.
12812920	12814440	I saw her on the hill.
12814440	12816200	Then it was her voice, I heard.
12816200	12819080	Yes, and the trouble with the horrid thing is that she's so cold,
12819080	12821480	I wouldn't even want to touch her, Moomin.
12821480	12822280	Huh?
12822280	12823160	It's her!
12833160	12835000	I'm getting cold shivers all over.
12835000	12837160	Well, why do you expect in the snow?
12837160	12838520	No, it's the grok's fault.
12838520	12839320	She's done it.
12839320	12841640	Look at my skin, it's all goose bumpy.
12841720	12845800	It's not like that in the summer, it's smooth, not lumpy.
12845800	12849480	It's not the snow that makes me feel so cold, it's her staring at me.
12849480	12850200	I'm scared.
12858920	12860280	That was great.
12860280	12861320	Good, isn't it?
12861320	12862920	You can have as much as you like.
12862920	12865080	We picked more raspberries than ever this year,
12865080	12867400	and Mama made lots of juice.
12867400	12868680	Thanks.
12868680	12870200	Oh.
12870440	12872280	Ah, I want that.
12874200	12875880	Mama's silver tray?
12875880	12876360	Yeah.
12876360	12877720	What do you want it for?
12877720	12880600	To slide on the snow with a coarse stupid.
12880600	12883240	But it's a sort of family treasure in heirloom.
12883240	12886360	Well, you never use it and it's so shiny.
12886360	12889480	It'll make a great sled and go really fast.
12895800	12898120	Doesn't look like they'll wake up till spring.
12898120	12900120	They're lucky, they're still sleeping.
12900120	12902600	I think it's very unfair that I woke up like this.
12906280	12908120	So, what should we do now?
12908120	12910040	I want to go look at the sea.
12910040	12911240	Good idea.
12911240	12912920	At least that won't be covered in snow.
12926520	12928760	I bet the great cold was just like this.
12930840	12934600	Oh, no.
12934600	12935560	What's the matter?
12935560	12936840	I forgot the tray.
12936840	12937560	Never mind.
12937560	12939800	You couldn't use it as a boat anyway, it would sink.
12940440	12941480	Yes, you could.
12941480	12941960	What?
12941960	12942440	How?
12942440	12943320	Oh, look.
12943320	12944200	There's the sink.
12951240	12952920	But it's all frozen.
12952920	12954600	So we'll be able to slide on it.
12956280	12957480	What's that over there?
12960360	12961320	It's forgotten.
12983800	12984760	Sorry.
12985800	12986120	Let go.
12986120	12987440	Oh, no.
12987440	12988440	Oh, hold on.
12988440	12990440	Hello, you, too.
12992440	12994440	You're not hibernating, either?
12994440	12998440	Oh, no. I haven't got time to spend four months sleeping.
12998440	13002440	Why not? Little May and I just woke up and now we don't know what to do.
13002440	13004440	I'm sure you can think of something.
13004440	13005440	Who's supposed to?
13005440	13008440	I've never seen the sea frozen before.
13008440	13010440	Did you make that horse too ticky?
13010440	13012440	Yes, I did. Can I sit on it?
13012440	13015440	No, you can't. I need it for the lady of the cold.
13015440	13017440	Oh, I see.
13017440	13019440	I suppose you've heard of her.
13019440	13023440	Yes, she's very beautiful, but if she looks into your eyes, you're turned into a block of ice.
13023440	13025440	She's not a very nice lady.
13025440	13029440	That's right, Little May and Spring can never come while she's here. It waits for her to go.
13029440	13033440	Oh, I see. And are you hoping she'll ride away on this horse, then?
13035440	13037440	Yes, and it will take her back to the north,
13037440	13041440	where she stays until she comes here again next winter and drives the sun away.
13041440	13045440	The horse doesn't look very solid to me, too, Tiki.
13045440	13051440	That's why I'm going to pour water over it when it gets really cold, and then it'll freeze solid.
13051440	13053440	When is the lady of the cold coming?
13053440	13059440	You can never tell, but soon, tonight, perhaps, it feels much colder already.
13059440	13061440	What's happened to the sun, Tiki?
13061440	13063440	Do you know when the sun will come back again?
13063440	13065440	Uh-당히.
13065440	13071440	It's in the south, shining on snuffkin, but it'll be back soon, and then it will stay a bit longer each day.
13071440	13073440	Good, I can't wait.
13073440	13075440	Now, I'll wait for it.
13075440	13077440	If you don't come back, it's a good thing to do.
13077440	13079440	What's happened to the sun, Tiki?
13079440	13081440	Do you know when the sun will come back again?
13081440	13083440	It's in the south, shining on snuffkin.
13083440	13087440	But it'll be back soon, and then it will stay a bit longer each day.
13087440	13093240	Good I can't wait. Now there'll be a full moon tonight and we'll be able to see everything.
13093240	13096640	Great! I can get my tray out. I can't wait to try it on the sea.
13096640	13098440	What do you mean, your tray?
13098440	13103940	Well, let's move in, Mama's tray, but I'm using it. I'm going to put a sail on it and slide across the ice.
13103940	13105440	Why not wait till tomorrow?
13105440	13109440	Wait until tomorrow? No. When I want to do something, I do it now.
13109440	13112440	What if the ice suddenly melts or something?
13113440	13114440	It...
13115440	13116440	Yeah!
13117440	13122440	I like it here. It's warm and cozy. I hope Moomin Papa doesn't mind me using it.
13122440	13128440	This is Papa's bathhouse. He built it himself and he'd be very glad to know you're using it.
13128440	13131440	It's great. The windowpains are different colors.
13131440	13136440	If you look out through one, the world is red and through another one, the world is green.
13148440	13155440	Oh, you don't hibernate either, do you? Now Scram! The horrible lady of the cold is coming and if she looks you in the eye, you'll turn to ice!
13155440	13157440	Go on! Go away!
13158440	13159440	Moomin!
13175440	13177440	Moomin! Toothiggy!
13178440	13179440	Moomin!
13181440	13184440	Moomin! Toothiggy, why you?
13184440	13186440	Little Mike, we're over here, huh?
13188440	13190440	Why are you doing down there?
13190440	13193440	Don't take his trying to catch some fish!
13193440	13196440	If she does, she's gonna cook us some dinner!
13196440	13199440	Right! I've got to get sailing, man!
13199440	13202440	I'd better go see what she's doing to Mom and Silver Trey.
13202440	13203440	Okay.
13206440	13208440	Ah, got one.
13214440	13216440	Oh dear, me.
13218440	13221440	Mmm, it's cold and wet under that ice.
13221440	13223440	How are you doing, little Mike?
13223440	13225440	Very well, thank you.
13226440	13229440	How can you get under the ice anyway?
13229440	13232440	I guess the water must be low and there's a gap left there.
13232440	13233440	Oh, how?
13233440	13238440	I don't know, but perhaps the tide was in when the sea froze and some of it got stuck to the shore.
13238440	13241440	Oh, I suppose it's possible.
13241440	13246440	Doothiggy told me that she has fish soup every day in the wintertime.
13248440	13252440	I know. I'll go see if the horse is frozen yet.
13252440	13254440	Make sure you shut the door behind you.
13254440	13256440	Oh, my thumb!
13265440	13268440	Mmm, I don't think it's hard enough yet.
13268440	13271440	I'll collapse if the lady if the cold gets on it now.
13275440	13278440	Oh, it's getting colder and colder!
13299440	13301440	The Grooke.
13304440	13307440	Don't tell me you want to ride the horse.
13309440	13312440	I don't think you'd better.
13312440	13315440	This is for the lady of the cold, you know.
13317440	13319440	There's no telling what she'd do to you.
13319440	13322440	Look you in the eye, probably.
13329440	13331440	Even the Grooke is frightened of the lady of the cold.
13339440	13342440	Ah, now it looks frozen.
13345440	13347440	Wee!
13351440	13353440	Wee!
13354440	13355440	Ha!
13357440	13359440	Great, isn't it, movement?
13359440	13361440	Yeah, that old tree really moves.
13361440	13362440	Want to go?
13362440	13364440	No thanks, I'm too big.
13364440	13368440	Come on now, the fish soup is ready and it's time you were inside, little my.
13368440	13370440	Keep it warm for me, I'm having another go.
13370440	13371440	No, little my.
13372440	13373440	Why not?
13373440	13377440	Have you forgotten what I told you the lady of the cold may be coming?
13377440	13378440	Oh.
13378440	13380440	Well, I want to see her, I'm not scared of her.
13380440	13382440	I'll be moving so fast she won't get a chance.
13382440	13385440	No, now listen to me, little my.
13385440	13388440	All you have to do is not let her look you in the eye.
13388440	13392440	But what happens if you're not quick enough and she catches you before you turn away?
13392440	13396440	I know, if we watch her from the bathhouse, she won't see us.
13400440	13401440	Please, little my.
13401440	13403440	Come in, she's almost here.
13403440	13405440	We can watch her from inside.
13405440	13412440	That's no good, I want to see her properly.
13412440	13413440	No, little my.
13413440	13414440	Don't go.
13419440	13421440	Come back, little my.
13424440	13425440	Oh dear.
13425440	13428440	Come on, let's get back in the cabin before it's too late.
13428440	13430440	Weeee.
13430440	13433440	No, no, no, no.
13436440	13439440	No, no, no, no.
13443440	13445440	Oh, the lady of the cold.
13446440	13450440	No, no, no.
13453440	13458440	No, no, no.
13460440	13467440	I saw her face, I saw her face.
13467440	13471440	I saw her and she didn't turn away to eye.
13471440	13474440	Trust little my to get away with it.
13474440	13477440	I don't know how she does it.
13477440	13479440	I think her nerves are made of steel.
13479440	13481440	I hope she's alright.
13481440	13482440	She's fine.
13482440	13483440	She's fine.
13483440	13485440	I don't know how she does it.
13485440	13487440	I think her nerves are made of steel.
13487440	13489440	I hope she's alright.
13489440	13493440	She should try not to make so much noise out there.
13493440	13495440	Oh dear.
13495440	13499440	You are home.
13499440	13509440	Oh dear.
13509440	13517440	Oh dear.
13517440	13525440	Oh dear.
13525440	13532440	Oh dear.
13532440	13540440	Oh dear.
13540440	13543440	Yeah, I know her face.
13543440	13547440	I know her face.
13547440	13553440	Oh.
13553440	13560440	Oh.
13560440	13566440	Oh dear.
13566440	13570440	Oh dear.
13570440	13577440	Little boy.
13577440	13582440	Oh.
13582440	13589440	Oh.
13589440	13596440	Oh.
13597440	13603440	Oh.
13603440	13610440	Oh.
13619440	13625440	Little boy.
13627440	13629440	Little my.
13629440	13632440	Come on, please.
13632440	13638440	Wake up, please.
13638440	13641440	Oh, please don't stay frozen, little my.
13641440	13642440	Don't worry, little my.
13642440	13643440	We'll thought you out.
13643440	13644440	Don't worry.
13644440	13651440	It's nice and warm here.
13657440	13661440	Ow, that's hot moment.
13661440	13663440	Praise the ball, Bob.
13663440	13668440	You come back.
13668440	13672440	So little my came back from the cold, little the worst for wear.
13672440	13674440	Movement need not have worried.
13674440	13683440	For the little my's in this world are practically indestructible.
13683440	13690440	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
13690440	13698440	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
13698440	13702440	They're always happy and always at play.
13702440	13709440	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
13709440	13716440	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
13716440	13723440	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
13723440	13728440	They're always happy and always at play.
13728440	13735440	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
13735440	13742440	The movements, the movements.
13742440	13749440	The movements.
13765440	13770440	Here they are for one and all.
13770440	13773440	The movements are about to come.
13773440	13776440	Come on and sit down here with me.
13776440	13778440	They're here for you on your TV.
13778440	13781440	They are the movements.
13781440	13784440	They are the movements.
13784440	13787440	So come with me, give me your hand.
13787440	13790440	I'll take you up to a movement land.
13790440	13793440	You can fly just like a bird.
13793440	13796440	Sing that song ever.
13796440	13799440	There were the movements.
13799440	13802440	There were the movements.
13802440	13805440	There were the movements.
13805440	13808440	There were the movements.
13808440	13811440	There were the movements.
13811440	13814440	There were the movements.
13814440	13844440	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
13844440	13866940	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba ...
13866940	13871260	little my woke up in the middle of it. I couldn't get back to sleep.
13871260	13877260	Ah, this is great. I'm really starving. I hope there's lots.
13877260	13881500	Oh, there's plenty left. Mama thought she'd made too much this year, but it's lucky for
13881500	13884900	us she did. I don't know what we'd have had to eat otherwise.
13884900	13896580	Shh, they're still sleeping. Well at least you got me to play with
13896580	13898580	Moomin.
13916180	13921220	That was fun. Why don't you have a go, Moomin? I'm probably a bit heavy for it.
13921220	13925900	So get something else, dummy. I might later. Anyway, I thought we were going to see
13925900	13931020	you too, Tiki. Come on, I'll pull you. Okay.
13934220	13939260	I know why you don't want to go, Moomin. You're scared of sliding down from the top, aren't you?
13939260	13942460	No, of course I'm not.
13949340	13954300	Tiki's not here. I wonder where she's gone too. That's her over there, isn't it?
13954300	13958220	Oh, yeah, I think it is.
13958220	13961500	Jane Moomin, she looks like she's sliding.
13961500	13965500	Sliding? Yes, it's obvious. She's sliding, of course.
13965500	13968700	She's coming over.
13969980	13972300	What were you doing out there, Tiki?
13972300	13977260	Watching the sun go down. It's the only place you can see it from. I just caught it for
13977260	13982140	it disappeared over the horizon. Where did it go to? It comes up again in the south and will
13982140	13986540	probably shine on snuffkin. Hey, Tiki, what are those things you got on your feet?
13987340	13991500	They're called skates, and they're the best thing possible for moving across the ice quickly.
13992140	13995820	Just what I need. Come on, show me how to do it. Yes, okay?
13999020	14005900	That's great. I'm going to make myself some skates, too. It's not as easy as you think, little lie.
14005900	14010460	Pathetic. All you need is a sword and knife on your shoes, and that sounds easy enough to me.
14012300	14021340	You know, it's strange, but I've got a funny kind of feeling that there's someone else, apart from us, in the bathhouse.
14021340	14024540	Hmm, well, there it is. Who is it? Where are they?
14026540	14028220	Little lie. You can't see them.
14028860	14032860	Ha, what do you mean I can't see them? Where are they hiding in the cupboard?
14032860	14035980	No, they're invisible. Look, I'll show you.
14042780	14047180	Oh, oh, there's something on my head! See, that's two of the shoe mice.
14047180	14050620	They're eight of them all together. Now, don't walk on the little lie.
14054540	14059580	I didn't see any shoe mice here in the summer, although if they're invisible, I wouldn't have done.
14060220	14066220	No, probably not, as in the summer when we come across new little animals that we've never seen before,
14066220	14069900	and who likes snuffkin, go away when the wind and snow comes.
14070540	14076700	Then, when the days are shorter and everyone else is hibernating, they come out, and some are so shy
14076700	14080380	they're invisible, dear. I'm afraid I don't understand winter at all.
14081100	14085660	Well, of course you don't. You moments have always slept through and don't know very much about it.
14086700	14091020	Oh, I can't wait to tell Mum or Papa about all this. They'll be really amazed.
14091100	14092860	Oh!
14096860	14097420	Moomin!
14098380	14099020	What is it?
14099660	14101660	We will wake up tomorrow, won't we, Moomin?
14102220	14104060	I'm sure we will. Why?
14104060	14107180	I just don't want to go on sleeping and sleeping until spring.
14107500	14109500	Well, we woke up today so…
14109500	14111500	But we don't know about tomorrow!
14111500	14114300	No, of course not. We'll have to wait and see.
14114300	14117580	If we're awake, we'll know, and if we're asleep, then it doesn't matter.
14117580	14122580	Well, if I'm not awake and you are, wake me up, okay, Moomin?
14122580	14124580	Yes, all right. Go to sleep now.
14124580	14127580	What if it's the other way around, Moomin?
14127580	14130580	Well, what if I wake up and you're still fast asleep?
14130580	14135580	I don't mind sleeping all winter. Now stop talking to me, my.
14135580	14137580	You'd better wake me up, or else.
14147580	14157580	Hey, little mind. Or have you gone to?
14158580	14164580	Hey, little mind. Or have you gone to?
14174580	14176580	Oh!
14176580	14181580	Hello! Well, well, wonderful place for skiing you've got here.
14181580	14184580	What are those funny things on your feet?
14185580	14187580	Hey, what? You're joking.
14187580	14189580	You mean you really don't know what these are?
14189580	14191580	That's why I'm asking you.
14191580	14194580	Well, they're skis, didn't you see me come down?
14194580	14198580	Yes, I did. Can you slide on the ice with these and go just as fast?
14198580	14201580	Oh no, on ice, you have to use skates.
14201580	14203580	What is that, young lady?
14203580	14207580	Oh, it's a snowboard. You slide on the snow with it.
14215580	14220580	Oh, that's not bad, but it's only a silver tray, isn't it?
14220580	14221580	That's right, mister.
14221580	14222580	I'll teach you to ski.
14222580	14224580	No, thank you. I'll learn by watching you.
14224580	14225580	Won't take me long at all.
14225580	14228580	I'm afraid skiing is not that easy, young lady.
14228580	14230580	Don't worry. It won't be for me.
14230580	14233580	Everything is once I decide to do it.
14234580	14235580	Epee!
14241580	14244580	Oh, so you spend all year going where the snow is?
14244580	14245580	That must be tiring.
14245580	14248580	Not at all. Life should be a struggle.
14248580	14250580	This jam is really good.
14250580	14254580	Does it always have to be winter, catch a struggle in spring and summer instead?
14254580	14256580	Well, no, that would be too easy.
14256580	14258580	You could just sit back and relax.
14258580	14262580	No, you've got to face up to the cold and exercise to keep warm.
14262580	14265580	Oh, that sounds very interesting, Mr. Brisk.
14265580	14271580	One clear cold bath a day keeps all those unnecessary thoughts away.
14271580	14273580	My own little poem.
14273580	14276580	What? You don't mean you swim in this weather, do you?
14276580	14279580	The water must be very close to freezing.
14279580	14282580	Well, the sea is a lot colder than that. It is frozen.
14282580	14283580	Is there a river?
14283580	14287580	Yes, there is, but the water looks very, very cold.
14287580	14289580	Sounds just right.
14290580	14294580	Have you got any more of this wonderful jam? It's delicious.
14294580	14299580	There's some more in the cellar, but we've got cranberry up here if you'd like that.
14299580	14302580	No, thanks. This will do for now.
14302580	14306580	I'd appreciate some after my daily swim. It'll work up an appetite.
14312580	14314580	Oh, this is great.
14315580	14318580	I can hardly watch. It makes me shiver all over.
14318580	14321580	Is everybody like you? Where you come from?
14321580	14324580	I'm personally not. Why did you join me?
14324580	14326580	No, thank you.
14328580	14331580	Hello? What are you two looking at?
14331580	14332580	Huh?
14333580	14335580	Oh, hello there, little dog.
14335580	14338580	We're watching that madman down there.
14339580	14341580	He looks like he's swimming.
14341580	14344580	Moon Valley is full of very odd people.
14344580	14347580	He's not from Moon Valley as a matter of fact.
14347580	14349580	Who are you?
14349580	14352580	I'm sorry, and I'm looking for my brothers.
14352580	14355580	I don't suppose you've seen them, have you?
14355580	14358580	Your brothers? Have you lost them?
14358580	14361580	Are they hibernating somewhere, do you think?
14361580	14364580	Oh, no, not them. They never do that.
14364580	14367580	Well, everyone else in Moon Valley is hibernating.
14367580	14370580	Except little Mai here, now too ticky, and the invisible mice.
14370580	14373580	Me? Oh, and that crazy person down in the middle.
14377580	14379580	Oh, yeah!
14384580	14387580	My brothers are up in the Lonely Mountains. Is that far from here?
14387580	14389580	No, not far.
14389580	14393580	Lonely Mountains. I know there are wolves up there, but I never heard of any dogs.
14394580	14397580	Well, wolves and dogs are brothers, didn't you know?
14401580	14406580	Oh, you know, this tastes even better after an invigorating swim.
14406580	14409580	That's my favorite jam, much nicer than cranberry.
14409580	14411580	Oh, I agree.
14413580	14416580	And doggie, now don't you want your jam?
14416580	14418580	What? No, you haven't.
14418580	14420580	Oh, thank you.
14420580	14423580	Oh, you look as though you're a bit worried about something.
14423580	14425580	Yes, I suppose I am.
14425580	14427580	Worried spat?
14427580	14429580	Put it out of your mind.
14429580	14434580	Why do you think your brothers are wolves? Did someone tell you they were?
14434580	14437580	Of course they are. Everyone knows that.
14437580	14439580	And besides, I can feel the wolf in me.
14439580	14442580	Well, you might feel it, but nobody can see it for a star.
14442580	14444580	Wolves are much bigger than you.
14444580	14446580	I want to go and find them, and then we can all hell at the moon.
14446580	14448580	I've been practicing.
14448580	14451580	I can see why he wants to be a wolf, but we'd better keep him here.
14451580	14454580	He could get her if he goes up there on his own.
14454580	14457580	You don't really want to live with wolves, do you?
14457580	14459580	Oh, I do very much.
14459580	14461580	Why don't you travel around with me, sorry, you?
14461580	14465580	I've got little dogs. They could be your brothers and sisters if you want.
14465580	14466580	Well, I don't know.
14466580	14469580	Look, I'm going to stay here and move in valley for a while,
14469580	14471580	and we can become great friends.
14471580	14473580	You're going to stay here?
14473580	14476580	Yes, marvelous slopes, fine swimming, the most wonderful jam,
14476580	14478580	and I'll build myself an igloo.
14478580	14480580	An igloo? You mean a house made of snow?
14480580	14482580	Yes, that's exactly.
14482580	14486580	If it's alright with you, I'll take this jam with me, just to keep me going.
14504580	14508580	Hello there. Can I borrow your spade for a minute, Mr. Brisk?
14508580	14510580	Of course. What for, my friend?
14510580	14512580	I want to break up this barrel.
14512580	14515580	Oh, that's easy. Allow me, little mind.
14515580	14518580	Here, here, here.
14518580	14521580	How's that young lady?
14525580	14529580	Mr. Brisk really loves this jam. He can't stop eating it.
14529580	14533580	Well, it's very nice, Moomin. I can't imagine anyone not liking it.
14533580	14535580	Do you know how to ski to a tiki?
14535580	14538580	Well, of course I do. I just haven't done it yet.
14538580	14542580	Mr. Brisk says that he's going to teach me.
14542580	14543580	Oh.
14545580	14548580	I can't move my legs tied up like this.
14548580	14552580	That's the whole point. You don't have to. You just move your skis. He's his winking.
14553580	14555580	No, no, no.
14558580	14561580	First of all, you have to learn how to fall properly.
14561580	14565580	Well, then if I learn to ski first, then I won't fall.
14571580	14573580	Little mind has skis, too.
14573580	14577580	Oh, they're just made from an old barrel. You're too much more sophisticated.
14577580	14581580	Now, an advantage in ease and lean forward. Are you ready?
14581580	14586580	I don't think I like this. It's too steep. Can I practice on something a bit flatter?
14586580	14590580	Well, maybe next time. Now then, I'll have a few rolls.
14602580	14605580	Trying to start an avalanche, Moomin?
14605580	14608580	You know, I think this hill is even steeper than the last one.
14608580	14611580	There's nothing to worry about. You've already mastered falling down.
14611580	14612580	Have you gone in?
14623580	14624580	Oh, stop it, please.
14624580	14626580	You can do it yourself. Just calm down.
14632580	14635580	Oh, look at that. Marvelous. You need it.
14636580	14639580	Please, someone stop me, please.
14643580	14646580	That was terrific, Moomin. Let's do it again.
14656580	14658580	What are you looking at, sorry, you?
14658580	14660580	I can hear all my brothers howling out there.
14660580	14662580	They're probably hungry and looking for food.
14662580	14665580	No, I know they're calling me.
14665580	14669580	I'm going to see them. I've really got to, Moomin.
14683580	14685580	Got anything? No, not yet.
14685580	14689580	I'm afraid there's going to be trouble. We're running out of jam.
14690580	14692580	Mr. Bresch, I suppose.
14692580	14694580	You can't stop eating it.
14694580	14696580	Well, you have to ask him to leave.
14696580	14697580	I can't do that.
14697580	14701580	Well, of course you can. It's your home and you can choose who you have.
14712580	14715580	A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.
14715580	14718580	Usually, a sign that spring is not far away.
14720580	14722580	A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.
14722580	14725580	A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.
14725580	14727580	A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.
14727580	14729580	A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.
14729580	14731580	A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.
14731580	14733580	A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.
14733580	14735580	A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.
14735580	14737580	A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.
14737580	14740580	A snowstorm.
14768580	14770580	Hello, Moomin.
14770580	14773580	Oh, hello, Mr. Bresch.
14773580	14776580	Look, I'm sorry, but all the jam's gone.
14776580	14778580	I'm just an empty jar.
14778580	14780580	Oh, well, never mind. It was a great jam.
14780580	14783580	But I have more important things on my mind.
14783580	14787580	You see, now that spring is here, I have to leave, Moomin Valley.
14787580	14790580	Oh, do you?
14790580	14794580	Hmm, it's sad, but there you are. I have to go.
14794580	14796580	Goodbye, Moomin.
14796580	14798580	Goodbye, then, Mr. Bresch.
14798580	14800580	Keep some jam for me.
14827580	14829580	Hello, I'm sorry. I'm your brother.
14829580	14832580	I've wanted to be with you for a long, long time.
14832580	14835580	I'm afraid I'm not very brave or strong, but if you'd let me stay with you.
14835580	14838580	Oh, don't you know me?
14838580	14841580	Looks like I was wrong.
14841580	14843580	Oh, well, go on.
14843580	14846580	Eat me if you want to.
14846580	14851580	It's a pity I didn't sleep at night instead of learning to howl.
14851580	14855580	Moomin was right. I shouldn't have come.
14907580	14911580	Oh, hello, little buggy. What are you doing here?
14911580	14915580	Have you been waiting for me?
14915580	14919580	We'll have a great time traveling around the world together.
14920580	14934580	Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
14934580	14947580	Diverdi! Diverdi! Diverdi!
14964580	14969580	That was spring breaking through the ice.
14969580	14972580	Look at the theme moment, it's free again.
14972580	14974580	Will Little Mike get back?
14974580	14975580	Oh.
14975580	14977580	Oh my goodness.
14995580	14998580	Little Mike, hang on to me.
14998580	14999580	Thank you, Movement.
14999580	15001580	Let's go.
15001580	15002580	It's all right, Movement.
15002580	15004580	Don't panic, I'm with you.
15004580	15005580	You're okay.
15005580	15006580	Oh.
15006580	15007580	Oh.
15007580	15008580	Oh.
15008580	15009580	Oh.
15009580	15010580	Oh.
15010580	15011580	Oh.
15011580	15012580	Oh.
15012580	15013580	Oh.
15013580	15014580	Oh.
15014580	15015580	Oh.
15015580	15016580	Oh.
15016580	15017580	Oh.
15017580	15018580	Oh.
15018580	15019580	Oh.
15019580	15020580	Oh.
15020580	15021580	Oh.
15021580	15022580	Oh.
15022580	15023580	Oh.
15023580	15024580	Oh.
15024580	15026580	Over there, Movement.
15026580	15027580	Quick, do.
15027580	15033580	See, if you knew what I'd tell you, there's nothing to be afraid of.
15033580	15034580	Just trust me, Movement.
15034580	15036580	I'm always right, aren't I?
15036580	15043580	Yes, I know you are, Little Mike, but we'd still better hurry.
15043580	15050580	Come on, you two just a bit further.
15051580	15052580	Uh-oh.
15052580	15053580	No.
15053580	15055580	Wow.
15055580	15058580	Oh, it's cold in here.
15058580	15060580	Quickly, let's get inside and light a fire.
15060580	15062580	You'll soon warm up.
15065580	15067580	Shoot.
15072580	15076580	And so Mr. Brisk and the ice both left Woman Valley.
15076580	15083580	And spring returned once more after a long and eventful winter.
15083580	15090580	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
15090580	15097580	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
15097580	15101580	They're always happy and always at play.
15101580	15108580	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
15108580	15112580	The movements.
15112580	15119580	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
15119580	15127580	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
15127580	15130580	They're always happy and always at play.
15130580	15137580	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
15137580	15141580	The movements.
15141580	15147580	The movements.
15157580	15169580	Here they are for one and all.
15169580	15172580	The movements are about to come.
15172580	15175580	Come on and sit down here with me.
15175580	15178580	They're here for you on your TV.
15178580	15181580	They are the movements.
15181580	15184580	They are the movements.
15184580	15187580	They'll come with me, give me your hand.
15187580	15190580	I'll take you up to a moment land.
15190580	15193580	You can fly just like a bird.
15193580	15195580	Sing that song ever.
15195580	15198580	There were the movements.
15198580	15201580	There were the movements.
15201580	15204580	There were the movements.
15204580	15207580	There were the movements.
15207580	15210580	There were the movements.
15210580	15213580	There were the movements.
15213580	15243580	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
15243580	15273580	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
15273580	15276580	and enjoying the sunshine and the flowers.
15278080	15280580	Everyone that is except for Mumen
15280580	15283580	was in bed with a terrible cold.
15296580	15299580	Oh dear, Mumen, that's a nasty cough.
15299580	15301580	My throat is very sore.
15301580	15303580	Ah, this will help soothe it.
15303580	15305580	It's one of grandma's best potions.
15309580	15310580	It's hard.
15310580	15313580	Never mind. Nice tasting medicines don't always work as well.
15316580	15318580	I wanted to go out, it's spring.
15319580	15322580	I know dear, but you'd catch pneumonia or something.
15323580	15324580	Mama?
15325580	15328580	Does anyone know why snuffkin hasn't come back yet?
15329580	15333580	No, perhaps spring came earlier this year and he wasn't ready.
15337580	15339580	Snuffkin had always come back to Mumen Valley
15339580	15341580	on the very first day of spring.
15342580	15343580	But not this year.
15348580	15349580	Snuffkin.
15349580	15350580	Mumen.
15356580	15359580	I'm Mumen Papa, is Mumen any better?
15359580	15362580	No, I'm a Fred not, he's still got a nasty cough.
15362580	15363580	Can I go up and see him?
15363580	15365580	No, you'd better not, you might catch it.
15370580	15371580	Papa's right, Snuffkin.
15371580	15373580	You know how poorly you get when you're ill.
15373580	15375580	It's best not to take the risk.
15375580	15377580	I should think he'll be up and about before very long.
15377580	15380580	Yes, it's better to be safe than sorry.
15380580	15383580	Mumen shouldn't have gone out in the winter, should he, Mama?
15384580	15386580	No, but he couldn't go back to sleep.
15386580	15389580	Snow would have that effect on anyone.
15389580	15393580	Not you, little Mai was out in the cold with him and look at her.
15393580	15395580	She seems healthy enough.
15397580	15399580	I'll take these flowers to Mumen later.
15399580	15402580	Little Mai's too small to catch a cold.
15408580	15410580	This is boring.
15410580	15412580	I can't believe that Mumen's sick.
15412580	15415580	And Snuffkin's not back either.
15415580	15417580	I sure wonder what's happened to him.
15417580	15421580	I bet you Mumen gets better as soon as Snuffkin arrives in Mumen Valley.
15421580	15424580	He's never been this late coming back before.
15424580	15427580	Perhaps he's got better with you guys.
15427580	15430580	Impossible, he's very fond of me.
15430580	15432580	He's told me so lots of times.
15432580	15434580	He likes Mumen too, of course.
15434580	15437580	He might have been captured by a highwayman.
15438580	15440580	Let's go and look for him.
15440580	15441580	A highwayman?
15441580	15443580	First Snuffkin, Silly.
15443580	15445580	He's got to come back so Mumen will get better.
15445580	15446580	We must find him.
15446580	15448580	But where do we look, Snork Maiden?
15448580	15449580	In the south.
15449580	15452580	It's a big place. He could be anywhere.
15452580	15455580	Well, I don't care how big it is I'm going anywhere.
15455580	15456580	You're being silly.
15456580	15457580	No, I'm not.
15457580	15459580	I don't think your brother will like it.
15459580	15461580	In fact, I know he won't.
15461580	15464580	Have you gone completely bananas?
15464580	15465580	No, I haven't.
15465580	15467580	And you'll just have to make your own muffins.
15467580	15469580	There's more to food than muffins.
15469580	15471580	I was speaking figuratively.
15471580	15473580	Anyway, I'm going, dear brother.
15473580	15476580	And nothing you can do or say will stop me.
15476580	15477580	It's for Mumen.
15477580	15479580	That's a sort of hairbrain scheme
15479580	15481580	that could only have been dreamed up by you.
15481580	15482580	What good will it do?
15482580	15484580	You don't even know where he is.
15484580	15487580	It is not. Mumen is pining for Snuffkin.
15487580	15488580	Rubbish.
15488580	15490580	Men don't pine for their friends.
15490580	15492580	If he isn't back yet, then he isn't coming.
15492580	15495580	And if he isn't going to come, what's the point of looking for him?
15495580	15497580	You won't find him anyway.
15499580	15502580	He will come when he knows that Mumen is sick.
15502580	15504580	Black males just like a sister.
15504580	15507580	Something done for love could never be black male.
15507580	15509580	Oh no, you're not going and that's fine.
15509580	15512580	Look, why don't you and little Mai go by yourselves?
15512580	15515580	Well, I didn't really make a definite decision.
15515580	15517580	I just sort of said that I might come along,
15517580	15519580	but if Snort Maiden isn't going,
15519580	15521580	then there doesn't seem any point, does there?
15521580	15524580	And I'm not going because I think it's stupid and hairbrain, too.
15524580	15526580	Snuffkin will come back soon.
15526580	15527580	Not Snort Maiden.
15527580	15529580	What do you say to that?
15529580	15532580	How is Mumen feeling any better?
15532580	15535580	He's asleep now, but the cough doesn't seem so bad.
15535580	15537580	And is temperature still there?
15537580	15538580	Yes, it is.
15538580	15539580	And is temperature still there?
15539580	15540580	Yes, it is.
15540580	15541580	And is temperature still there?
15541580	15542580	Yes, it is.
15542580	15543580	Yes, it is.
15543580	15544580	It doesn't seem so bad.
15544580	15547580	And is temperature still quite high?
15574580	15575580	Snuffkin!
15579580	15580580	Snuffkin!
15591580	15593580	Am I pleased to see you, Mumen?
15593580	15595580	You look like you needed a lift.
15595580	15598580	This magic cloud must be one of those we got
15598580	15600580	from the Hobgoblins top hat.
15600580	15601580	That's right.
15601580	15602580	I had one of them away.
15602580	15604580	What a good idea, Mumen.
15604580	15605580	You are clever.
15605580	15608580	Well, it was so much fun the last time, wasn't it?
15608580	15609580	Hi, Mumen!
15609580	15610580	Hi!
15610580	15612580	Oh, look, Snuffkin.
15612580	15614580	I didn't know they were here, too.
15620580	15621580	Snuffkin!
15625580	15626580	Mumen!
15626580	15628580	Snuffkin!
15629580	15633580	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
15637580	15639580	Not just a dream.
15639580	15640580	Snuffkin!
15647580	15649580	You look blousy, Mumen.
15649580	15650580	Oh, thanks, stinky.
15650580	15652580	You'd better keep away.
15652580	15654580	There's no need, bugs, and things like that.
15654580	15655580	Stay away from me.
15655580	15657580	They're probably frightened of someone so healthy.
15658580	15660580	Mama isn't letting anyone in here.
15660580	15661580	It's very dull.
15661580	15662580	You followed a bed or something?
15662580	15663580	Yes, I did.
15663580	15664580	I know.
15664580	15666580	You were dreaming, weren't you?
15666580	15668580	Unfortunately, yes.
15668580	15670580	I know how you feel.
15670580	15672580	I have that dream a lot.
15672580	15675580	Oh, you stand on a windowsill,
15675580	15677580	getting ready to break the glass,
15677580	15679580	and inside there's diamonds.
15679580	15680580	And then, moment, you fall.
15680580	15683580	It's not the same dream at all, stinky.
15683580	15685580	Snuffkin hasn't come back yet.
15685580	15686580	Have you heard anything from him?
15686580	15687580	He's very late.
15687580	15688580	Oh, Snuffkin.
15689580	15690580	Huh.
15690580	15691580	You know something, don't you?
15691580	15693580	All I know is that he went away
15693580	15694580	as usual last autumn.
15694580	15695580	It hasn't come back yet.
15695580	15696580	And then...
15696580	15697580	Yes, what?
15697580	15699580	Snork Maiden wanted to go looking for him
15699580	15702580	because she thinks that if Snuffkin comes back,
15702580	15703580	you won't be sick anymore.
15703580	15705580	But Snork wouldn't let her.
15705580	15707580	Snork Maiden?
15710580	15712580	Hey, Snork Maiden!
15712580	15714580	Snork Maiden!
15717580	15719580	You're not serious, are you?
15719580	15721580	I feel perfectly all right.
15721580	15723580	You look like that's warmed up, if you ask me.
15723580	15725580	Thanks a lot.
15725580	15729580	Now, stinky, tell me which way does Snuffkin normally travel south?
15729580	15731580	Hey, are you going looking for him?
15731580	15734580	Yes, it's not really spring in Moomin Valley
15734580	15735580	if he's not around.
15735580	15737580	It's just not right somehow.
15737580	15740580	Okay, you're all as mad as each other.
15740580	15742580	But you'll help me?
15742580	15744580	I've got to try and find him, stinky.
15744580	15747580	Yes, all right, but don't tell your parents I helped you.
15747580	15749580	Don't worry, I won't say a thing.
15769580	15771580	Sorry, stinky. Are you okay?
15771580	15773580	No, I'm fine.
15774580	15776580	Here's your lunch, Moomin.
15776580	15778580	How are you feeling?
15778580	15780580	Moomin?
15780580	15783580	Papa, come here quickly.
15786580	15789580	Oh, Papa, Moomin's gone. He's not in his bed.
15789580	15792580	Not in his bed? Are you sure, Mama?
15792580	15797580	Of course I am. His room is empty and there's no sign of him.
15797580	15799580	Perhaps he's in one of the other rooms.
15799580	15801580	Don't worry, Mama, I'll find him.
15804580	15808580	Yo, Moomin.
15808580	15811580	Moomin.
15811580	15813580	Hi, Moomin, Papa.
15813580	15814580	Oh, little Mai.
15814580	15816580	What's wrong? You look worried.
15816580	15818580	A moment's gone off somewhere.
15818580	15821580	I expect you must have gone to look for Snuffkin.
15821580	15823580	Snuffkin?
15823580	15826580	Well, you know how crazy Moomin is about him.
15826580	15828580	It's stupid if you ask me.
15828580	15831580	But he's not well, he's got a fever.
15857580	15859580	Are you sure this is the right way?
15859580	15862580	Of course I'm sure. I live in this forest, don't I?
15862580	15864580	Why don't we miss each other somewhere?
15864580	15867580	Well, if you think you might, don't go there and it's up to you.
15867580	15871580	But I've got to...
15871580	15873580	Moomin!
15873580	15875580	Oh, Snarkmaid.
15875580	15877580	Huh?
15877580	15880580	Where are you taking him, Stinky? You can see he's not well.
15880580	15883580	I'm not taking him. He insisted on going. I came to look after him.
15883580	15885580	Is that really right, Moomin?
15885580	15889580	Yes, I wanted to find Snuffkin, so he'd come back.
15889580	15891580	Well, I was going to find him for you.
15891580	15894580	Little Mai and Sniff were coming too, but they chickened out so I came on my own.
15894580	15896580	What did Snork say about that?
15896580	15897580	That he wasn't happy.
15897580	15899580	Oh, he made a big fuss and I just let him.
15899580	15901580	So you just walked out and came on your own?
15901580	15903580	Brothers, always think they can tell you what to do.
15903580	15906580	I just ignore him. Did you tell your parents where you were?
15906580	15908580	Ah, no.
15908580	15911580	Did you put him up to this Stinky? It's just a sort of thing you do.
15911580	15912580	No, I did not.
15912580	15914580	That's true, Snork Maiden.
15914580	15919580	Well, I don't know how you did it, Stinky, but I know you and I know you're to blame
15919580	15921580	and I don't think I won't find out.
15921580	15924580	That's not fair, Snork Maiden. It was nothing to do with me at all.
15924580	15926580	Oh, he's right, Snork Maiden.
15926580	15928580	He didn't want to show me the way, but I made him.
15930580	15932580	I'm taking you home.
15932580	15934580	Oh, but Snork Maiden.
15934580	15938580	No, buts. You're sick and you should be in bed and your parents must be very worried.
15938580	15940580	Look!
15941580	15942580	Moomin!
15942580	15945580	Oh, it's Papa. Isn't that Snork behind him?
15945580	15947580	I guess it is.
15947580	15949580	Uh-oh, it's time I wasn't here.
15949580	15953580	I'm glad you hadn't gone too far, Moomin. I might never have found you.
15953580	15955580	I'm very sorry, Papa.
15957580	15961580	I have a feeling you're behind this, Stinky. Come on, quickly, out with it.
15961580	15965580	Why doesn't anyone believe me? It was Moomin's idea. I swear it was.
15965580	15968580	It was, Papa. I wanted to find Snorkkin.
15969580	15971580	Are you all right, Moomin?
15971580	15973580	Snork Maiden!
15974580	15977580	Uh, here we go again.
15977580	15981580	Snork Maiden, what are you doing here? I thought I told you not to go on this silly jump.
15981580	15983580	Well, I didn't say I wouldn't. Did I?
15983580	15985580	Listen to me, Snork.
15985580	15990580	You're looking guilty, Stinky. How did you persuade her to disobey me?
15990580	15992580	See, I told you.
15993580	16001580	You stay nice and warm in bed and I'll mix some of grandma's potion with honey for you.
16001580	16006580	You'll have to be better soon because I have a feeling Snuffkin's on his way.
16012580	16016580	My wish Snuffkin would hurry up, then we could all get back to normal at last.
16016580	16019580	My sentiment's exactly.
16020580	16022580	So where is Snuffkin?
16022580	16025580	Well, he's on his way back to Moomin Valley.
16025580	16030580	But he's had a very long walk and is getting very tired now.
16041580	16045580	Poor Snuffkin. He's had a terrible cold as well.
16045580	16048580	Disfeeling rather weak.
16050580	16052580	Snuffkin.
16069580	16072580	Hello, I know you don't I?
16072580	16073580	Oh?
16073580	16076580	Yes, you're Snuffkin.
16080580	16081580	Oh!
16089580	16092580	Isn't that water still a little cold for that?
16100580	16104580	You'd better come by the fire and keep warm or you'll catch cold.
16110580	16112580	This is nice.
16118580	16121580	Just think, I'll be the one that's set by Snuffkin's fire.
16121580	16124580	And he told me to keep warm and not catch cold.
16124580	16128580	Hmm, that's no big thing, little fella. It's a pretty chilly night out here.
16128580	16132580	Oh, it is. I've heard so many stories about you from everybody.
16132580	16137580	And each year I try to watch you should go past, but I've never been brave enough to talk to you before.
16137580	16140580	Stories from everybody, I don't know if I like that.
16140580	16142580	In fact, I'm sure I don't.
16142580	16144580	What's your name, little fella?
16145580	16147580	Oh, well, I haven't got one.
16147580	16149580	I'm so small that nobody's ever asked me before.
16149580	16152580	I've always wanted to have a name, you know?
16152580	16154580	And it was you who asked me.
16154580	16157580	And I've actually met you and sat next to you at your camp fire.
16157580	16161580	Oh, it's so wonderful. You don't know how happy it makes me meeting you like this.
16161580	16165580	Oh, come on. You do go on a bit, old fella. You just get warm now.
16165580	16169580	Do you think, Snuffkin? Oh, I don't know whether I should ask you or I don't want to offend you.
16169580	16171580	Oh, well, why not? Yes, I will.
16173580	16178580	Perhaps you'd be kind enough to. I mean, would it be too much trouble for you to think of a name for me?
16180580	16182580	There. I've said it now.
16184580	16188580	Well, choosing a name is important. I'd have to think carefully about that.
16188580	16191580	But it will be easy for you. You know everything.
16191580	16196580	Now listen to me. You can't look up to people too much if you want to be yourself. It's not right.
16196580	16201580	But Snuffkin, you're so clever. You can do anything, anything at all. I know you can.
16201580	16206580	I've always wanted to be free like you to do whatever I feel.
16206580	16212580	Oh, I'm sorry I'm talking too much. I want to listen to you too. All about your travels for a start.
16212580	16215580	I know you're on your way to the Moon Valley to see all your friends.
16216580	16221580	The hedgehog told me the Moon stayed out for most of the winter. Just waiting for you to come back.
16221580	16223580	Now isn't that wonderful? What?
16223580	16227580	I'd love to have someone that missed me so much they were miserable until I came back.
16227580	16230580	You don't know how lucky you are that you're so special.
16230580	16235580	Well, perhaps I'm not going there. I might have somewhere else to visit instead.
16238580	16242580	Oh, Moon will be very sad if you don't go back.
16242580	16245580	Yes, but you've got to have time to be on your own as well.
16245580	16249580	Of course you have and I've taken up too much of yours now.
16249580	16251580	Wait, I think I'll be off.
16251580	16253580	Okay, thanks.
16257580	16259580	Goodbye Snuffkin.
16259580	16261580	Good night, little fella.
16273580	16276580	Hey, wait a minute. What about your name?
16276580	16278580	You remembered.
16278580	16282580	Well, what do you think of TD Wu, my friend?
16282580	16284580	Yes, TD Wu.
16284580	16288580	It's nice and happy to start with and then a little sadness.
16288580	16290580	TD Wu.
16290580	16293580	That's right. TD Wu.
16293580	16296580	TD Wu.
16296580	16299580	TD Wu. TD Wu.
16299580	16301580	TD Wu.
16301580	16303580	TD Wu.
16303580	16305580	TD Wu.
16305580	16309580	That's right. It's a wonderful name.
16309580	16311580	TD Wu.
16311580	16317580	I'm glad you like it. It's the first time I've ever given anyone a name.
16317580	16323580	I think I'll be able to house and then I can put up a real name plate that says TD Wu.
16323580	16327580	Ah, good idea, TD Wu. About what I said before.
16327580	16328580	Huh?
16328580	16334580	You know, not going back to Moon Valley? Well, I am. I've missed Moon and all my friends.
16334580	16338580	Oh, I didn't take that seriously. You just got upset at something I said.
16338580	16341580	I'm afraid that happens a lot. I guess I talked too much.
16341580	16343580	Maybe you do.
16343580	16348580	I'll be going back to Moon Valley a bit behind schedule and this year Spring came along early too.
16348580	16352580	But I suppose it's better late than never, as I say.
16352580	16357580	Moment will be happy. Say hello to everyone from TD Wu.
16357580	16360580	I will. And I'll tell them how it came about.
16360580	16365580	That's where you keep your harmonica, isn't it, Snuffkin? It's really famous, you know?
16365580	16367580	I didn't realize that.
16367580	16371580	Do you know? I've never ever heard any music.
16374580	16376580	Really? What would you like me to play?
16376580	16381580	Anything. Oh, I know. What about Moon's favorite?
16381580	16383580	I don't know.
16412580	16418580	Hmm? That's Snuffkin!
16433580	16435580	Don't know.
16441580	16443580	Snuffkin!
16471580	16478580	Now at last Spring really has come to Moon Valley.
16502580	16508580	The Moon is. The Moon is.
16508580	16515580	They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moon is.
16515580	16522580	Believing and sharing and caring and giving the Moon is.
16522580	16526580	They're always happy and goes at play.
16526580	16533580	The Moon's are having fun day after day. The Moon is.
16533580	16543580	The Moon is. The Moon is.
16557580	16563580	Here they are for one and all. The Moon's are about to call.
16563580	16577580	Come on and sit down here with me. They're here for you on your TV. They are the Moon's.
16577580	16583580	They are the Moon's. So come with me, give me your hand.
16583580	16589580	I'll take you up to Moon and land. You can fly just like a bird.
16589580	16594580	Sing that song ever. There were the Moon's.
16594580	16597580	There were the Moon's.
16597580	16600580	There were the Moon's.
16600580	16603580	There were the Moon's.
16603580	16606580	There were the Moon's.
16606580	16609580	There were the Moon's.
16613580	16618580	There were the Moon's.
16618580	16623580	There were the Moon's.
16623580	16627580	There were the Moon's.
16627580	16632580	There were the Moon's.
16632580	16638580	There were the Moon's.
16638580	16642580	There were the Moon's.
16643580	16647580	All is peaceful in Moon Valley.
16647580	16650580	Mama waters the flowers.
16650580	16655580	While Papa relaxes in the shade on the porch.
16655580	16659580	Look, Mama, Moon Papa is sleeping again.
16659580	16661580	He had a long nap yesterday.
16661580	16663580	I think it must be the weather.
16663580	16665580	Too hot and sunny for me.
16665580	16668580	I wonder if he's worried about anything.
16668580	16671580	You don't sleep if you're worried you do something about it.
16672580	16676580	But Moon and Papa does have something on his mind.
16676580	16683580	Although it doesn't keep him awake.
16683580	16688580	He's having a nice dream as well.
16702580	16706580	Oh, a lighthouse.
16706580	16709580	That's it.
16709580	16711580	That's it, a lighthouse.
16711580	16713580	What about a lighthouse, Papa?
16713580	16715580	We're going to visit one.
16715580	16716580	When?
16716580	16717580	Right now.
16717580	16720580	Well, as soon as I find one, anyway.
16720580	16722580	That should stop you being bored, Mama.
16722580	16724580	Oh, I'm not really dear, but it would be nice.
16724580	16725580	Yeah.
16725580	16728580	Oh, I'm really excited.
16729580	16732580	It turns into a lovely water.
16732580	16736580	Yeah, I'll write an exciting, epic novel of the sea.
16736580	16738580	I'm sure it will be a great success.
16738580	16742580	If he puts some action in it, misses out the romantic stuff.
16752580	16755580	Stop it!
16759580	16761580	Tell me.
16761580	16764580	Does Moonman Papa want all of you to go away to this lighthouse?
16764580	16765580	Oh, yes.
16765580	16766580	It'll be great fun.
16766580	16768580	Just think of all the ships we'll be able to see.
16768580	16770580	Yes, that will be good.
16770580	16773580	Papa says he wants to write an exciting story about the sea.
16773580	16775580	With ships and storms and stuff.
16775580	16777580	Probably pirates, too.
16777580	16780580	Oh, he's stuck writing his memoirs again, is he?
16780580	16783580	Well, I guess that might have something to do with it.
16783580	16785580	But I think he just wants another adventure.
16785580	16786580	He's bored.
16786580	16788580	Well, it sounds a bit odd to me, Moonman.
16788580	16789580	No, it's not.
16789580	16795580	We're going to live in a real lighthouse and save ships from the rocks and being wrecked terrible storms.
16795580	16796580	Oh, I see.
16796580	16799580	What do you think the lighthouse keeper might say about you moving in?
16799580	16801580	Oh, he won't mind at all.
16801580	16804580	It'll be company for it, and I'm sure he'd like someone to talk to.
16804580	16807580	Looking after lighthouse is a very lonely job.
16807580	16812580	Ah, but if you thought, Moonman, that might be exactly why he chooses to do it.
16813580	16817580	You mean that he might want to be on his own all the time?
16817580	16819580	Well, some people like it like that.
16819580	16822580	Sometimes I like being on my own.
16822580	16824580	Not for long, though.
16824580	16826580	It'll be a lot of fun.
16826580	16829580	Snuffkin, why don't you come with us?
16829580	16831580	What, to a lonely lighthouse?
16831580	16833580	Yes.
16834580	16838580	Oh, no, which one is it?
16838580	16840580	There, that's the one.
16841580	16843580	So small, you can hardly see it.
16843580	16846580	How long would it take us to get their Moonman, Papa?
16846580	16849580	A day or two, I should say, depending on the wind.
16849580	16851580	But it looks so tiny.
16851580	16852580	Oh, I don't know.
16852580	16853580	Well, I think so.
16853580	16855580	How do we know which one is which?
16855580	16858580	Oh, don't you worry about that.
16858580	16864580	I've got an old compass somewhere, and we've got the map, then at night we'll be able to see the light itself.
16864580	16866580	Anyway, an old sailor.
16866580	16867580	An old sailor?
16867580	16869580	Well, I'm not really that young.
16869580	16870580	And you're no sailor.
16870580	16871580	Is this mutiny?
16871580	16872580	Don't be stupid.
16875580	16877580	How long do you think you'll want to stay, Papa?
16877580	16878580	About a month.
16878580	16881580	Oh, we'll need to take lots and lots of food, then.
16882580	16883580	Well, bless me.
16883580	16885580	I think that'll be enough, Mama.
16885580	16887580	Surely there'll be somebody living there already.
16887580	16888580	Don't be stupid.
16888580	16889580	Of course there is.
16889580	16891580	A lighthouse must have a keeper.
16892580	16896580	Yes, a man dedicated to the sea, suffering loneliness and hardship,
16896580	16899580	saving countless lives with no regard for his own.
16905580	16906580	Huh?
16906580	16907580	Is that you, Sniff?
16907580	16909580	Yes, hi, Mr. Hamilton.
16909580	16912580	I thought you'd be busy packing for the trip to the lighthouse.
16912580	16915580	No, well, I'm not going with them this time.
16915580	16917580	I've decided to stay here.
16917580	16920580	Oh, dear me, really? Sniffkin said he was going.
16920580	16922580	Well, I have something very important to do.
16922580	16923580	Important?
16923580	16925580	Sniff is just a big whip, that's all.
16925580	16927580	Oh, shut up, little mind.
16927580	16928580	Ah, don't tell me to shut up.
16928580	16930580	I don't listen to whims.
16930580	16933580	Hmm, now, now children, no squabbling.
16933580	16935580	It wouldn't be fair to the others.
16935580	16937580	I'm not a very good swimmer.
16937580	16939580	You mean if you fell and then we're drowning,
16939580	16940580	we'd have to jump in and save you.
16940580	16941580	Don't fall in, then.
16941580	16943580	Anyway, you could hang on to an or something.
16943580	16945580	What if it got swept away?
16945580	16948580	We'll put a life jacket on you stupid, don't worry.
16948580	16949580	What about the sharks?
16949580	16951580	They might take a fancy to me.
16951580	16952580	Wait a minute.
16952580	16954580	I know I'm not as�ologist,
16954580	16956580	but I don't think there are any sharks around here.
16956580	16958580	I'm sure I would have heard if there were.
16964580	16966580	Well, it's a real fine day for sailing.
16966580	16969580	Where are mama and the others?
16969580	16972580	Don't worry, Mumma, there's no hurry.
16972580	16975580	Are you sure that isn't too heavy for you, Sniff?
16975580	16977580	No, not at all, mama.
16977580	16979580	It's a shame that you're not coming with us,
16979580	16981580	but if you've got something important to do,
16981580	16983580	it won't be the same without you, though.
16983580	16985580	We'll miss you, Sniff.
16985580	16986580	Thank you.
16986580	16988580	Oh, dear, I left a jar of strawberry jam
16988580	16991580	and a whole batch of pancakes on the kitchen table.
16991580	16993580	Do you think you could manage to eat them?
16993580	16994580	Leave it to me.
16994580	16997580	Hi, y'all be lucky if there's any food left in the lard or mama.
16997580	16999580	He's a my.
