815300,818300,"We better tell of the truth, I guess.",813800,815000,"SPEAKER_03"
825300,827300,"The best thing would be for me to talk to her first.",825300,827700,"SPEAKER_15"
827300,828300,"Yes, I agree.",825300,827700,"SPEAKER_15"
828300,831300,"She's unbelievable. How could she?",827800,828600,"SPEAKER_06"
834300,837300,"I can hardly believe you could be so mean, Grandma.",828900,831000,"SPEAKER_15"

842300,844300,"You did it for me.",840300,842300,"SPEAKER_15"
844300,847300,"If the moments are asleep, why should you go there?",843400,858600,"SPEAKER_15"
847300,849300,"Do them a world of good, too, along sleep.",843400,858600,"SPEAKER_15"
849300,851300,"How ridiculous, grandmother.",843400,858600,"SPEAKER_15"
851300,853300,"Alicia, you've done quite well in your studies,",843400,858600,"SPEAKER_15"
853300,859300,"and if you keep at it, I see no reason why you shouldn't be a fully-fledged witch before 30.",843400,858600,"SPEAKER_15"
859300,864300,"And if I do see the moments, I won't be a witch till I'm 31, is that what you mean?",843400,858600,"SPEAKER_15"
864300,867300,"Now, the moments are very bad, and the ones on you.",860100,863900,"SPEAKER_15"
867300,872300,"They are so disgustingly good, and if you want to be a witch, you mustn't see them.",864500,871500,"SPEAKER_15"
873300,881300,"And if I promise never to go near Moomin Valley again, will you lift the spell, Grandma?",872800,873300,"SPEAKER_13"
881300,884300,"Good girl, that's exactly what I wanted here.",881300,883700,"SPEAKER_15"

890300,891300,"What do you want?",889500,890500,"SPEAKER_15"
891300,895300,"There are two different ways of lifting the spell I cast on the moments.",890700,891200,"SPEAKER_06"
895300,896300,"Uh-huh.",895000,895000,"SPEAKER_06"
895300,896300,"Uh-huh.",895000,895500,"SPEAKER_15"
896300,901300,"The first one is that I go to Moomin Valley myself and chant the magic words outside their bedroom window.",895700,903300,"SPEAKER_15"
901300,903300,"Oh, Grandma, that's not a good idea.",901100,901500,"SPEAKER_13"
903300,908300,"Oh, oh, you mean people who might be upset about me casting a spell on the moments?",902500,903000,"SPEAKER_00"
908300,910300,"You may be right.",903800,908900,"SPEAKER_15"
910300,914300,"So therefore, Snuff Kid, I have no choice but to ask you to perform the task.",909200,910200,"SPEAKER_15"
914300,916300,"Oh, but why me?",912300,914700,"SPEAKER_15"
916300,918300,"You do have your harmonica with you?",915900,916600,"SPEAKER_06"
918300,919300,"Of course.",917100,918900,"SPEAKER_15"

966300,968300,"You must do something.",964900,972700,"SPEAKER_01"
968300,971300,"Perhaps if you could possibly use your whistle to wake them up.",964900,972700,"SPEAKER_01"
971300,972300,"Uh-huh.",964900,972700,"SPEAKER_01"
972300,974300,"It's very shrill indoors. Good frighten them.",964900,972700,"SPEAKER_01"
974300,976300,"And fire your revolver.",972800,973400,"SPEAKER_08"
976300,978300,"I'm sure that would do it, Inspector.",972800,973400,"SPEAKER_08"
