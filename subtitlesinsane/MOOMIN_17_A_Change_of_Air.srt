21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
However, this lazy lifestyle, no matter how pleasant it might be, does not suit everyone.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh!

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes?

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Would you like a cup of coffee, dear?

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I think I need one, Mama.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh, dear, is it your memoirs?

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm stuck.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Ah, can I help?

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
How can I create in this?

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In what?

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In this sleepy atmosphere, and I've also come to a boring part.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
When was that?

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The time I wrote poem is.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,199
Were they any good?

36
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,599
No.

37
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,599
Well, miss that bit out then.

38
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,599
I can't.

39
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,599
I must put it down for posterity. It is my duty.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,599
But how can I get inspiration here in this place

41
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,599
when nothing ever happens, nothing ever happens at all?

42
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,599
Oh, I think this means another adventure.

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,719
Yes, Mama, that I need it to be big, exciting, and frightening.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,639
Mama, what's the matter? Are you all right?

45
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,759
Your father says that because nothing ever happens here,

46
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,879
he can't write.

47
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,360
So I'm looking for an adventure for him.

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,759
Can you think of anything?

49
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:27,000
He wants it to be big, exciting, and frightening.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Does he want something really exciting?

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes, dear, I'm afraid so.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I think I could manage that.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That looks like the footprint of a huge monster.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:25,500
Oh, it's a good feeling giving others a sight-man. Yeah, I was harder than I thought.

55
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Oi! Sleepy heads!

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Wake up everybody, Mom and Papa! Quickly get up! Mom and Mama, a monster! You've been visited by a monster!

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Wake up before you eatin' alive!

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Come on, hurry! Hurry!

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
My, what huge tracks!

60
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,199
Ah, that should keep them guessing for a while!

61
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:57,600
Hmm, it could be a monster from the depths of the ocean.

62
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,800
Something's not right here.

63
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't you think it's a bit odd that it came directly to Moome House?

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,399
Yeah.

65
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:06,500
Well, look at the footsteps! They go in a straight line!

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Someone must have told it to go to Moome House!

67
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,300
And they're only going one way!

68
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,800
Look, there are tiny footsteps going back to the sea!

69
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Oh, now that the monster must still be here then!

70
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Oh, well, not necessarily!

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,399
Retracing one's own footsteps is the sign of an advanced intelligence.

72
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:33,399
Stepping back exactly the way you came. The tough question is why would the monster do that?

73
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,199
One is led to believe that it wants us to think it's still here.

74
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,600
Well, in fact, it has gone back to wherever it came from.

75
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,399
Fiddled battle is my dear mother would say?

76
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,000
But why would it want us to think that, Papa?

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's a spy.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, it's a spy.

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Something it shouldn't.

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It'd hardly be a good spy if we knew

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
if they have to sneak in and out.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think it's still here.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I can feel it. You know what I mean?

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Perhaps tonight.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Tonight? What about tonight? That's when they'll attack. It's gone back to give its report.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
How do you know that, Papa?

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, obviously, that's why it still wants us to believe it's here.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Mama! Mama! Yes? What is it, Mum?

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Something terrible is going to happen.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
A monster is going to attack us tonight!

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And Papa's excited about it!

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh, good. That's nice for him.

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Hurry everyone!

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I expect the monster will be here soon.

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, poor!

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Now hold it still.

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is gonna be a good barricade, don't you think?

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Hmm, we'd better make sure it's big enough.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's hardly any fun to tall-playing tricks on them. They're so gullible!

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If we catch the monster, we can sell it to a zoo. I'll handle a sale, of course.

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'd rather tame it and keep it as a pet.

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Well, you could ride on it to go pig-nicking.

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh no.

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
All right, now for the moat. Here we go. Hope the well's got enough water in it.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It'll be able to swim in this, Papa.

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes, it'll remind you to the sea and keep it calm.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,120
This is fresh water, Papa. We'd better put some salt in it. Good idea, Momen. We'll plant some seaweed and put some rocks in too, and then it'll feel really at home.

108
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,920
I wonder when it'll come.

109
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,920
I don't know, but I can feel in my bones. It'll be tonight.

110
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,120
And we keep watching till it comes? Of course we will, constantly.

111
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,000
What if it doesn't come till tomorrow night,

112
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,639
or the night after that?

113
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,000
It might be a long wait, so we'll take it in turns

114
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,560
and remember everybody.

115
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,120
The safety of Moon in Valley relies upon our vigilance.

116
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,000
We must be ready. Ready. Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Huh?

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Huh?

119
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Huh?

120
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Huh?

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Huh?

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Huh?

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Huh?

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Huh?

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Huh?

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Huh?

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Huh?

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Huh?

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Huh?

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Huh?

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Huh?

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Huh?

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Huh?

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Huh?

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Huh?

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,539
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Look at what those fools have done. It was worth all the trouble. Oh.

137
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:46,539
Oh.

138
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:47,539
Oh.

139
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:48,539
Oh.

140
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,860
Look, they put down food.

141
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,860
His bait, moving papa must be worn out.

142
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,960
Well, I'll take the food anyway.

143
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,460
Carefully, does it?

144
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,620
Don't want to wake up the guard.

145
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,059
This is great.

146
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:03,059
Ugh.

147
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,059
Ugh.

148
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:12,000
Ugh. I've managed to play a really good trick on the stupid moments and they've given me a slap-up meal as well.

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, what's that?

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The monsters here shut the gate.

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
There's the rope. Quickly!

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No, no! Stop! Wake up, everybody!

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
To wash!

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, no!

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No, it's only me!

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Big room! I'll get it!

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh, what?

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, where is it?

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
There's no monster only me!

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Please, it's me! It's me, Stinky!

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,720
Stinky? Well well it sounds like stinky

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It really is him, you know.

167
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It is?

168
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes, it was Stinky.

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And he really did make those footprints.

170
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
How do you know that Snuffkin?

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I was fishing off the shore last night when I saw him digging the holes.

172
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The little rascal was at it for hours and hours. Why don't you come inside Stinky? This is great! It was very good of you to make the footprints.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Papa hasn't had so much fun at ages.

174
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm glad it was hard work and I lost all my hair too!

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Well, Miss Jeff isn't always easy, you know.

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You can say that again!

177
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is delicious!

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
No!

179
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Papa, are you alright? Yes, thank you, Mummian. Mama.

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes, dear?

181
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Shh. I've got something important to tell you.

182
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What is it, Papa?

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
A secret in my mind is made up.

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Of course, dear. I'm going to tell you. What is it, Papa?

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
A secret in my mind is made up.

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Of course, dear.

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm going to run away on an adventure trip.

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's nice for you.

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's a trip without a destination full of mystery,

190
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
hazards and hardships, and you're coming to, Mama.

191
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, splendid.

192
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Shall we take all the children or just move in?

193
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
No, no children. That would be the same as here, only somewhere else. We'll run away.

194
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Run away, mumin, Papa?

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll be an adventurer again, just as I was in my lost youth, and with you by my side will have adventure romance.

196
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
All we desire, the sun, the stars.

197
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,200
But what about mumin? He'll be frantic.

198
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,279
You won't, and it's time he learned to stand on his own feet.

199
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,360
Fan for himself, become a man.

200
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,759
We can't protect him forever, you know.

201
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,559
He's big enough to be left by himself.

202
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm on, Mama.

203
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh, just a milk-mout-papa.

204
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Well, you can't take anything more with us.

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
No, I know, but I forgot to write down where the sugar is.

206
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If they can't find it, they'll just have to do without.

207
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But then they won't be able to make cakes and the tea will taste awful.

208
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, and they'll never find this cinnamon on them. Where shall I leave it?

209
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Goodness, Mama, cinnamon I ask you when the unknown is calling to us.

210
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I should have gone on my own, indeed, I should. But then what good is an adventure when you can't say who?

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That was a close shave to someone after us.

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Is there anything wrong, Papa?

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,559
No, everything is fine, but we must leave before dawn.

214
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,559
All right.

215
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,559
We have a long way to go.

216
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,559
How far and where? It's very dark, you know.

217
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:49,000
Yes, isn't it? We'll just follow our feet and they say this way. Hey.

218
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,600
Oh, my God.

219
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,399
Good morning, mama.

220
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Mama, where are you? What's the matter, Moomin? My parents are missing. Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. That's a bit of a problem I'm getting hungry.

221
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I need my breakfast.

222
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I have to start the day with a good meal.

223
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm starving.

224
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Me too.

225
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What's the matter, Moomin?

226
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
My parents are missing.

227
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Are you sure?

228
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Of course I'm sure.

229
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That's a bit of a problem I'm getting hungry.

230
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I need my breakfast.

231
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,740
I have to start the day with a good meal. I'm starving. Me too!

232
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,580
Don't worry, Moomin. I'm sure that Moomin, Mama and Moomin Papa will be back home very soon.

233
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,000
But where could they have gone to, Snuffkin?

234
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,940
No idea. Have they left a note? Have you had your breakfast yet, Moomin?

235
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,000
No, nothing. It's not the shame without Mama.

236
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Cheer up, Moomin! You can have this fish.

237
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And I'll come up to Moomin House and cook it especially for you, if you like.

238
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Thanks, enough kin. But there are two cooks there already.

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Little Mayan's sniff, a bull trying to cook.

240
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I bet it fair, I bet it fair.

241
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This is great. There's lots of there, I bet it's there. This is great.

242
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
There's lots of delicious things I want to try out.

243
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Where are we, Papa?

244
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No idea, Mama.

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Too dark to see anything at all.

246
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
We've been gone for hours.

247
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I think it should have been light by now.

248
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh dear, we have to face it.

249
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm afraid we're lost.

250
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm sorry, Mama, but there it is.

251
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh, what do you mean?

252
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Well, in the dark we must have wandered into some caves.

253
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Who knows how many different tunnels we took.

254
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It could be weeks before we find our way.

255
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Little Miley, it's morning! Mind your own business. Little mind's burning.

256
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Mind your own business, I might like burnt food.

257
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's very nutritious. Watch your own cooking.

258
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It couldn't be any worse than the last lot you made for us.

259
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Ha! I wonder where Moomin is. He likes my food.

260
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'll get him to try it.

261
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:26,000
He can try mine first. Now that I I practice it'll be perfect. Momen, I've got something for you! Mom! Mom! Mom!

262
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Mom!

263
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Mom!

264
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Mom!

265
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Mom!

266
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Mom!

267
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Mom!

268
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Mom!

269
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Mom!

270
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Mom!

271
00:16:44,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Mom! Mom! What was that?

272
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Moment, Papa.

273
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Wake up.

274
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Moment, Papa. Oh! It tastes brackish! We must be quite near the sea.

275
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

276
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

277
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

278
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

279
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

280
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

281
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

282
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm going to have to go to the beach.

283
00:17:44,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm going to have to go to the beach. I'm going to must be quite near the sea. That's a big one.

284
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Gotcha! Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,

285
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,

286
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,799
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, I've never seen such a big fish movement.

288
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,599
Just wait till Papa sees it.

289
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,720
Oh yes, moment Papa.

290
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
This looks familiar.

291
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
It's moment Fally isn't it?

292
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,079
Of course it is just outside the cave.

293
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,079
Oh dear.

294
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:02,240
I'm afraid that your father will be a bit disappointed.

295
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,039
Where is he then?

296
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,299
Well...

297
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:09,539
He's gone, looking for adventure.

298
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,140
Adventure? Where?

299
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,740
I don't really know. Somewhere.

300
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,339
I could have gone with him.

301
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:18,220
When's he coming home?

302
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,519
I'm afraid I don't know that either.

303
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:23,720
You know Papa tonight, tomorrow night.

304
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,839
Next Christmas, your guess is as good as mine, Moomin.

305
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,640
Wow, I bet he's having a great adventure right now.

306
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Hey, Mama?

307
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,359
Oh, oh, you...

308
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Mama? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, can you hear me? Oh! Goodness, the sea.

309
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh, this looks like... Oh, it gets... oh, dear.

310
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Terry, me, I don't...

311
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Oh, well, oh, my! my oh you see I'm in my middle.

312
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh yeah of course I'm in my middle. Oh look, look it's Papa! Papa's back everyone!

313
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Uh huh!

314
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Hi, Papa!

315
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Ah, well, I'm back.

316
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm so pleased to see you again.

317
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,400
Thank you, Mama. Papa, how was your adventure?

318
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,000
Eh, unexpected.

319
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yes, that's what I'd say.

320
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Unexpected. Any food.

321
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Oh, yes. You can try mine first, Moomban Papa.

322
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Oh, mine's the best. Try mine, Papa.

323
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh, that's good. I'm starving.

324
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
