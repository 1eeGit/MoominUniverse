71280	90000	I'll take you up to a movement land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there
90000	105280	during the long winter in movement valley almost everybody living there hibernates until the sunshine
105280	113680	comes again in the spring but for some reason movement and little my woke up in the middle of it
113680	121360	we couldn't get back to sleep ah this is great I'm really starving I hope there's lots
121360	126640	oh there's plenty left no one thought she'd made too much this year but it's lucky for us she did
126640	128560	I don't know what we'd have to eat otherwise
128560	141360	shh they're still sleeping well at least you got me to play with movement
141360	166320	and that was fun what are you ever going to move in I'm probably a bit heavy for it so get
166320	173360	something else dummy I might later anyway I thought we were going to see tuteki come on I'll pull you okay
178720	183600	I know why you don't want to go move in you're scared of sliding down from the top aren't you
183680	186800	no of course I'm not
193760	201200	tuteki's not here I wonder where she's gone to that's her over there isn't it oh yeah I think it is
202640	208960	jay movement she looks like she's sliding sliding yes it's obvious she's sliding of course
209760	218000	she's coming over what were you going out there tuteki watching the sun go down
218720	223280	it's the only place you can see it from I just caught it for it disappeared over the horizon
223280	228480	where did it go to it comes up again in the south and we'll probably shine on snuff can
228480	233120	hey tuteki what are those things you got on your feet they're called skates and they're the
233120	238880	best thing possible for moving across the ice quickly just what I need come on show me how to do
238880	249200	it yes okay that's great I'm going to make myself some skates too it's not as easy as you think
249200	254800	little lie pathetic I need a sort of knife on your shoes and that sounds easy enough to me
254880	264720	you know it's strange but I've got a funny kind of feeling that there's someone else apart
264720	272640	from us in the bathhouse well there is who is it where are they little my you can't see them
273280	279440	huh what do you mean I can't see them where are they hiding in the cupboard no they're invisible look
279440	293920	I'll show you see that's two of the shoe mice there are eight of them all together now don't
293920	303280	walk on the line I didn't see any shoe mice here in the summer although if they're invisible I
303280	309040	wouldn't have done no probably not as in the summer when we come across new little animals that
309040	315520	we've never seen before and who likes snuffkin go away when the wind and snow comes then when the
315520	322080	days are shorter and everyone else is hibernating they come out and some are so shy they're invisible
322080	327680	and there I'm afraid I don't understand winter at all well of course you don't you moments have
327680	332800	always slept through and don't know very much about it oh I can't wait to tell mummer and
332800	335360	papa about all this they'll be really amazed
341280	349360	move in what is it we will wake up tomorrow won't we move in I'm sure we will why I just don't want to
349360	355840	go on sleeping and sleeping until spring well we woke up today so but we don't know about tomorrow
355840	361120	no of course not we'll have to wait and see if we're awake we'll know and if we're asleep then

503440	509600	got a face up to the cold and exercise to keep warm oh that sounds very interesting mr brisk

1246080	1248080	Thank you, woman.
1248080	1252080	Let's go.
1252080	1254080	It's all right, women.
1254080	1256080	Don't panic, I'm with you.
1256080	1258080	You're okay.
1258080	1260080	Whoa.
1261080	1262080	It's all right, women.
1262080	1264080	Don't panic, I'm with you.
1264080	1266080	You're okay.
1266080	1268080	Whoa.
1268080	1270080	Oh.
1270080	1272080	Over there, women.
1272080	1274080	Quick, do.
1274080	1278080	See, if you do what I tell you, there's nothing to be afraid of.
1278080	1280080	Just trust me, women.
1280080	1282080	I'm always right, aren't I?
1282080	1286080	Yes, I know you are, little my, but we'd still better hurry.
1287080	1290080	Come on, you two, just a bit further.
1296080	1298080	Whoa.
1298080	1300080	Whoa.
1300080	1302080	It's cold in here.
1302080	1304080	Quickly, let's get inside and light a fire.
1304080	1306080	You'll soon warm up.
1310080	1312080	Phew.
1316080	1320080	And so Mr. Brisk and the ice both left woman valley
1320080	1326080	and spring returned once more after a long and eventful winter.
1328080	1334080	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1334080	1342080	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1342080	1346080	They're always happy and always at play.
1346080	1350080	The movements are having fun day after day.
1350080	1354080	The movements.
1354080	1358080	The movements.
1358080	1364080	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1364080	1370080	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1370080	1374080	They're always happy and always at play.
1374080	1378080	The movements are having fun day after day.
1378080	1382080	The movements.
1382080	1386080	The movements.
1386080	1392080	The movements.
