00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land.

00:36.000 --> 00:46.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:46.000 --> 00:58.000
there were the movements there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

01:16.000 --> 01:46.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

01:46.000 --> 02:12.300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-hhhhhh...

02:12.300 --> 02:15.300
The witch has come to Moomin Valley.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.300
What could she be up to this time?

02:17.300 --> 02:19.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:19.300 --> 02:20.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:20.300 --> 02:22.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:22.300 --> 02:23.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:23.300 --> 02:24.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:24.300 --> 02:26.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:26.300 --> 02:27.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:27.300 --> 02:28.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:28.300 --> 02:29.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:29.300 --> 02:30.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:30.300 --> 02:31.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:31.300 --> 02:32.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:32.300 --> 02:33.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:33.300 --> 02:34.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:34.300 --> 02:35.300
Eldris Cabalasum!

02:35.300 --> 02:36.300
Oh!

02:38.300 --> 02:40.300
Oh, it's snowing again.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.300
I must get a covered brown.

02:44.300 --> 02:45.300
Oh!

03:11.300 --> 03:13.300
The great thaw had come at last.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.300
The Moomin Valley.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.300
I think I can smell spring!

03:31.300 --> 03:34.300
Oh, I've never seen anything like this one before.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.300
Hello there, Mr. Hamilton.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.300
Hello, Sniff.

03:44.300 --> 03:45.300
You're up early this year?

03:45.300 --> 03:46.300
Yes.

03:46.300 --> 03:49.300
I think I've even beat Moomin to it.

03:49.300 --> 03:50.300
Is that so?

03:50.300 --> 03:52.300
Why are the Moomin so late this year?

04:00.300 --> 04:01.300
Moomin, wake up!

04:01.300 --> 04:02.300
Spring is here!

04:02.300 --> 04:03.300
It's time to wake up!

04:03.300 --> 04:04.300
Moomin!

04:06.300 --> 04:08.300
Maybe Snork Maiden's easier to wake up.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.300
Snork Maiden!

04:12.300 --> 04:14.300
And I thought I was difficult to wake up.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.300
I must get closer.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.300
What are you doing, Sniff?

04:27.300 --> 04:28.300
What am I doing?

04:28.300 --> 04:29.300
You can see, can't you?

04:29.300 --> 04:32.300
Of course I can, but why are you climbing up that?

04:32.300 --> 04:34.300
Moomin and Snork Maiden are still asleep.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.300
I have to wake them up.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.300
Why don't you go this way?

04:37.300 --> 04:38.300
It's easier!

04:42.300 --> 04:44.300
What are you doing?

04:48.300 --> 04:50.300
Funny, even Moomin Mama's still asleep.

04:56.300 --> 04:57.300
Wrong room.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.300
Come on!

05:01.300 --> 05:02.300
Wake up, lazy bones!

05:07.300 --> 05:09.300
Moomin, spring has come!

05:13.300 --> 05:15.300
We'll look at that!

05:15.300 --> 05:17.300
Wake up, you sleepyhead!

05:17.300 --> 05:19.300
Oh, you really are impossible!

05:19.300 --> 05:21.300
Moomin, Moomin, Moomin!

05:21.300 --> 05:23.300
This is odd, even for Moomin!

05:26.300 --> 05:28.300
Open the window, little mind!

05:29.300 --> 05:30.300
Oh, was I scared?

05:31.300 --> 05:33.300
Oh, I haven't you opened them up!

05:33.300 --> 05:34.300
I've tried, but they won't!

05:35.300 --> 05:36.300
You're kidding!

05:39.300 --> 05:41.300
No one can resist this little mind!

05:42.300 --> 05:43.300
Wake up, Moomin!

05:43.300 --> 05:45.300
I know you're ticklish!

05:47.300 --> 05:48.300
Hmm?

05:48.300 --> 05:49.300
Hmm?

05:49.300 --> 05:50.300
Hmm?

05:50.300 --> 05:51.300
Hmm?

05:51.300 --> 05:52.300
Hmm?

05:52.300 --> 05:53.300
Hmm?

05:53.300 --> 05:54.300
Hmm?

05:54.300 --> 05:55.300
Hmm?

05:55.300 --> 05:56.300
Hmm?

05:57.300 --> 05:58.300
Hmm?

05:58.300 --> 05:59.300
Hmm?

05:59.300 --> 06:00.300
Moomin!

06:00.300 --> 06:01.300
Moomin!

06:01.300 --> 06:02.300
I told you so!

06:04.300 --> 06:05.300
Hmm?

06:05.300 --> 06:06.300
Moomin!

06:06.300 --> 06:08.300
Come on!

06:08.300 --> 06:09.300
Eww!

06:09.300 --> 06:10.300
Eww!

06:10.300 --> 06:11.300
Eww!

06:11.300 --> 06:12.300
Eww!

06:12.300 --> 06:13.300
Eww!

06:13.300 --> 06:14.300
Eww!

06:14.300 --> 06:15.300
Eww!

06:15.300 --> 06:17.300
Eww!

06:17.300 --> 06:19.300
I give up!

06:19.300 --> 06:21.300
How strange!

06:21.300 --> 06:22.300
How sad!

06:22.300 --> 06:23.300
What do you mean?

06:23.300 --> 06:24.300
I think...

06:25.300 --> 06:26.300
You don't think...

06:26.300 --> 06:28.300
You don't think...

06:28.300 --> 06:29.300
It's hard to tell.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.300
I was listening for his heartbeat.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.300
He's still breathing.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.300
And snort baited?

06:39.300 --> 06:42.300
Wake up, you slug of it!

06:42.300 --> 06:44.300
Snort baited!

06:45.300 --> 06:46.300
They won't wake up!

06:47.300 --> 06:48.300
This is strange!

06:48.300 --> 06:50.300
Why don't we go and try the other?

06:50.300 --> 06:51.300
Why not?

06:51.300 --> 06:53.300
I hate it when others are asleep while I'm up.

06:53.300 --> 06:56.300
But then I don't like it much the other way around either.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.300
Do I snap?

07:01.300 --> 07:02.300
Moomin!

07:02.300 --> 07:03.300
Pop up!

07:03.300 --> 07:04.300
Please wake up!

07:04.300 --> 07:05.300
We've tried to wake up Moomin, but he won't!

07:05.300 --> 07:06.300
Wakey!

07:06.300 --> 07:07.300
Moomin!

07:07.300 --> 07:08.300
Mama breakfast time!

07:08.300 --> 07:09.300
Come on, Moomin!

07:09.300 --> 07:10.300
Pop up!

07:10.300 --> 07:11.300
Wake up!

07:11.300 --> 07:13.300
This is no use!

07:21.300 --> 07:22.300
Goodness!

07:22.300 --> 07:24.300
This seems the Moomins are still hibernating.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.300
And so is Snort Maiden.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.300
That's odd.

07:27.300 --> 07:29.300
She always wakes up even before me.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.300
Oh, Moomin, too!

07:31.300 --> 07:33.300
But this year it seems to be different!

07:33.300 --> 07:36.300
I'll go back home, and I'll come over again in a little while

07:36.300 --> 07:38.300
when the Moomin family will have woken up.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.300
If they ever do.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.300
Huh?

07:41.300 --> 07:44.300
We've tried everything to wake them up short of buckets of water

07:44.300 --> 07:45.300
and there's no moving them.

07:45.300 --> 07:49.300
We've shouted and shook and pinched and tickled and stopped!

07:49.300 --> 07:50.300
Oh, dear!

07:50.300 --> 07:52.300
It's not just strange, it's ominous!

07:52.300 --> 07:55.300
Oh, my, surely not.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.300
Hello, everybody!

07:57.300 --> 08:00.300
How is everyone?

08:00.300 --> 08:01.300
What is it?

08:01.300 --> 08:03.300
You all look very scared.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.300
Huh?

08:05.300 --> 08:08.300
Still hibernating?

08:11.300 --> 08:15.300
It's all very strange, Hamilton.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.300
Moomin!

08:17.300 --> 08:18.300
See?

08:18.300 --> 08:20.300
Yes, indeed.

08:22.300 --> 08:25.300
How we can really do is wait and see.

08:25.300 --> 08:26.300
I suppose you're right.

08:26.300 --> 08:27.300
Don't worry.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.300
The days are getting longer all the time now.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.300
So the Moomins can't sleep much longer.

08:32.300 --> 08:34.300
And Snort Maiden?

08:34.300 --> 08:36.300
Cheat too, of course.

08:36.300 --> 08:39.300
Bet you anything Moomin wakes up when Snuffkin returns.

08:39.300 --> 08:42.300
I think you're right, Sniff.

08:42.300 --> 08:46.300
And then, one day about a week later,

08:46.300 --> 08:50.300
Snuffkin did come back from his yearly trip south.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.300
Snuffkin!

08:52.300 --> 08:53.300
Snuffkin!

08:53.300 --> 08:54.300
Snuffkin!

08:54.300 --> 08:55.300
Snuffkin!

08:55.300 --> 08:56.300
Snuffkin!

08:56.300 --> 08:57.300
Snuffkin!

08:57.300 --> 08:58.300
Snuffkin!

08:58.300 --> 08:59.300
Snuffkin!

08:59.300 --> 09:00.300
Snuffkin!

09:00.300 --> 09:01.300
Snuffkin!

09:01.300 --> 09:02.300
Snuffkin!

09:02.300 --> 09:03.300
Snuffkin!

09:03.300 --> 09:04.300
Snuffkin!

09:04.300 --> 09:05.300
Snuffkin!

09:05.300 --> 09:06.300
Snuffkin!

09:06.300 --> 09:07.300
Snuffkin!

09:07.300 --> 09:08.300
Snuffkin!

09:08.300 --> 09:09.300
Snuffkin!

09:09.300 --> 09:10.300
Snuffkin!

09:13.300 --> 09:14.300
Snuffkin!

09:14.300 --> 09:15.300
Snuffkin!

09:15.300 --> 09:16.300
Snuffkin!

09:16.300 --> 09:17.300
Snuffkin!

09:17.300 --> 09:18.300
Snuffkin!

09:18.300 --> 09:19.300
Snuffkin!

09:20.300 --> 09:21.300
Snuffkin!

09:27.300 --> 09:28.300
Snuffkin!

09:28.300 --> 09:31.300
Snuffkin!

09:37.300 --> 09:38.300
Snuffkin!

09:38.300 --> 09:39.300
Snuffkin!

09:41.300 --> 09:42.300
Snuffkin!

09:42.300 --> 09:43.300
Snuffkin!

09:43.300 --> 09:44.300
Snuffkin!

09:44.300 --> 09:45.300
Snuffkin!

09:45.300 --> 09:46.300
Snuffkin!

09:46.300 --> 09:53.300
Where's Moomin?

09:53.300 --> 09:56.300
He's in bad.

09:56.300 --> 09:58.300
Moomin's still asleep.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.300
A sleep.

10:08.300 --> 10:11.300
They won't wake up no matter what you do.

10:11.300 --> 10:14.300
What do you think, Snuffkin?

10:14.300 --> 10:15.300
I think they're very sick.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.300
That's a possibility.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.300
Sleeping sickness, perhaps?

10:19.300 --> 10:21.300
It's very difficult to say.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.300
To me, though, if you want my honest opinion,

10:23.300 --> 10:26.300
I think somebody has cast a very nasty spell on them.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.300
A spell?

10:28.300 --> 10:30.300
But who would do that?

10:30.300 --> 10:32.300
I think I know.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.300
Huh?

10:33.300 --> 10:34.300
You mean the witch?

10:34.300 --> 10:36.300
Alice is grandmother.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.300
Why?

10:37.300 --> 10:39.300
To tell you the truth, I haven't the biggest idea.

10:39.300 --> 10:43.300
How do we find out?

10:43.300 --> 10:45.300
I'll go to the forest and see her.

10:45.300 --> 10:48.300
And if she did cast a spell, do you think she'd tell you?

10:48.300 --> 10:51.300
I really don't know, but we have to do something.

10:51.300 --> 10:54.300
We can't just leave them sleeping here forever.

10:54.300 --> 10:56.300
I'll go with you.

10:56.300 --> 10:59.300
I guess I better stay here to take care of things.

10:59.300 --> 11:03.300
Well, if they suddenly wake up, somebody needs to be here.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.300
Snuffkin.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.300
Huh?

11:06.300 --> 11:07.300
That's him.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.300
At last.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.300
Moomin.

11:09.300 --> 11:10.300
Moomin.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.300
Moomin.

11:11.300 --> 11:13.300
He's dreaming.

11:13.300 --> 11:17.300
Just looking at him makes me feel sleepy.

11:17.300 --> 11:23.300
Moomin, I promise to get this horrible spell cast off for you.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.300
Uh-oh.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.300
Uh-oh.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.300
Oh, shit.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.300
Where are you going?

12:02.300 --> 12:06.300
I've done all the chores, even washed out your old push-in jars.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.300
So where are you going?

12:08.300 --> 12:09.300
It's here, Grandma.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.300
I thought I'd take some time off to celebrate.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.300
But what about your work?

12:13.300 --> 12:16.300
I'm just going out for the day, Grandma.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.300
And I know where.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.300
I only want to see the Moomin's.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.300
They're still hibernating.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.300
No, they're not. It isn't winter anymore.

12:24.300 --> 12:28.300
Winter or spring, I happen to know the Moomin's are still asleep.

12:28.300 --> 12:31.300
How could you know what the Moomin's are up to, Grandma?

12:31.300 --> 12:32.300
Hm.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.300
Oh, which is no everything, my dear girl.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.300
Really?

12:35.300 --> 12:37.300
Well, I'll go and see.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.300
Come here.

12:46.300 --> 12:50.300
I have to admit that I can't help being worried about the Moomin's.

12:50.300 --> 12:53.300
Their windows are open for the spring.

12:53.300 --> 12:56.300
So they can smell the first spring flowers?

12:56.300 --> 12:59.300
Well, I suppose I'd be getting on.

13:04.300 --> 13:07.300
Why didn't you tell them about the witch in the spell?

13:07.300 --> 13:10.300
Well, after all, that was just an idea, I got.

13:10.300 --> 13:12.300
Ideas can be embarrassing if you were wrong,

13:12.300 --> 13:15.300
so don't tell anyone for the time being.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.300
All right.

13:16.300 --> 13:17.300
I'm going.

13:19.300 --> 13:21.300
And I'm leaving, too.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.300
Okay.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.300
There's Alicia.

13:30.300 --> 13:33.300
Hi, everyone. It's me.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.300
Why do you get a teller?

13:35.300 --> 13:38.300
We better tell of the truth, I guess.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.300
The best thing would be for me to talk to her first.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.300
Yes, I agree.

13:48.300 --> 13:51.300
She's unbelievable. How could she?

13:54.300 --> 13:57.300
I can hardly believe you could be so mean, Grandma.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.300
Calm down, my dear.

13:59.300 --> 14:02.300
Why, I did it all for you, Alicia.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.300
You did it for me.

14:04.300 --> 14:07.300
If the moments are asleep, why should you go there?

14:07.300 --> 14:09.300
Do them a world of good, too, along sleep.

14:09.300 --> 14:11.300
How ridiculous, grandmother.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.300
Alicia, you've done quite well in your studies,

14:13.300 --> 14:19.300
and if you keep at it, I see no reason why you shouldn't be a fully-fledged witch before 30.

14:19.300 --> 14:24.300
And if I do see the moments, I won't be a witch till I'm 31, is that what you mean?

14:24.300 --> 14:27.300
Now, the moments are very bad, and the ones on you.

14:27.300 --> 14:32.300
They are so disgustingly good, and if you want to be a witch, you mustn't see them.

14:33.300 --> 14:41.300
And if I promise never to go near Moomin Valley again, will you lift the spell, Grandma?

14:41.300 --> 14:44.300
Good girl, that's exactly what I wanted here.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.300
You promise me, Dan, Alicia?

14:46.300 --> 14:47.300
I promise, Grandma.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.300
Right, the spell should be lifted.

14:49.300 --> 14:50.300
Snuff guard.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.300
What do you want?

14:51.300 --> 14:55.300
There are two different ways of lifting the spell I cast on the moments.

14:55.300 --> 14:56.300
Uh-huh.

14:56.300 --> 15:01.300
The first one is that I go to Moomin Valley myself and chant the magic words outside their bedroom window.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.300
Oh, Grandma, that's not a good idea.

15:03.300 --> 15:08.300
Oh, oh, you mean people who might be upset about me casting a spell on the moments?

15:08.300 --> 15:10.300
You may be right.

15:10.300 --> 15:14.300
So therefore, Snuff Kid, I have no choice but to ask you to perform the task.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.300
Oh, but why me?

15:16.300 --> 15:18.300
You do have your harmonica with you?

15:18.300 --> 15:19.300
Of course.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.300
Let me have it, please.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.300
Eldris Cabalasome.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.300
Eldris Cabalasome.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.300
Eldris Cabalasome.

15:28.300 --> 15:29.300
Eldris Cabalasome.

15:29.300 --> 15:30.300
Eldris Cabalasome.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.300
Eldris Cabalasome.

15:32.300 --> 15:36.300
If you don't stop staring at me, my witchcraft won't be effective.

15:36.300 --> 15:39.300
Alicia, get me the next potion now.

15:39.300 --> 15:40.300
Oh.

15:40.300 --> 15:41.300
Oh.

15:41.300 --> 15:44.300
All right, grandmother.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.300
Eldris Cabalasome.

15:48.300 --> 15:49.300
Eldris Cabalasome.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.300
Eldris Cabalasome.

15:50.300 --> 15:53.300
Oh, she can't do it if we look at her, huh?

15:55.300 --> 15:57.300
Now, listen, Inspector.

15:57.300 --> 15:58.300
You must do something.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.300
You are the police, aren't you?

16:00.300 --> 16:04.300
Well, I have to tell you, waking people up is not really part of our job.

16:04.300 --> 16:06.300
But you're our last hope, Inspector.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.300
You must do something.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.300
Perhaps if you could possibly use your whistle to wake them up.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.300
Uh-huh.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.300
It's very shrill indoors. Good frighten them.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.300
And fire your revolver.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.300
I'm sure that would do it, Inspector.

16:18.300 --> 16:21.300
I don't carry guns, they're dangerous.

16:21.300 --> 16:23.300
Oh, dear.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.300
Hey, Snuffkin!

16:30.300 --> 16:32.300
Little Y!

16:32.300 --> 16:35.300
He sounds worried, I bet they're still fast asleep.

16:35.300 --> 16:36.300
Hmm.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.300
Right, Snuffkin?

16:41.300 --> 16:43.300
Get on with it.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.300
Hmm.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.300
It's not working, is it?

17:02.300 --> 17:04.300
Give me a chance, Snuff.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.300
Hmm.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.300
Snuffkin!

17:16.300 --> 17:18.300
Snuffkin!

17:18.300 --> 17:19.300
Snuffkin!

17:19.300 --> 17:20.300
Snuffkin!

17:20.300 --> 17:21.300
Snuffkin!

17:21.300 --> 17:22.300
Snuffkin!

17:22.300 --> 17:23.300
Snuffkin!

17:23.300 --> 17:25.300
Snuffkin!

17:25.300 --> 17:26.300
Snuffkin!

17:26.300 --> 17:27.300
Snuffkin!

17:27.300 --> 17:28.300
Snuffkin!

17:28.300 --> 17:29.300
Snuffkin!

17:29.300 --> 17:30.300
Snuffkin!

17:30.300 --> 17:31.300
Wake up, spring is here.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.300
Come on.

17:32.300 --> 17:33.300
Hmm.

17:33.300 --> 17:34.300
Hmm.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.300
Hmm.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.300
Hmm.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.300
Oh, spring is here already.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.300
Good morning, Papa, dear.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.300
Hmm.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.300
Good morning.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.300
I have a feeling we've over slept.

17:42.300 --> 17:44.300
I wonder whether the others are up yet.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.300
Snuffkin?

17:45.300 --> 17:46.300
Oh, shut up, Snuff.

17:46.300 --> 17:49.300
Maybe she forgot how to cast off the spell.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.300
Hi, Snuffkin!

17:50.300 --> 17:51.300
Hi!

17:51.300 --> 17:52.300
Ah!

17:52.300 --> 17:53.300
Morning!

17:55.300 --> 17:57.300
Morning, everybody!

17:57.300 --> 17:58.300
Hi, Snuffkin!

18:01.300 --> 18:04.300
I'm so glad you were right back already, Snuffkin.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.300
Yes.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.300
You woke up early, too.

18:08.300 --> 18:09.300
Did you hear that?

18:09.300 --> 18:11.300
It's you that woke up late, woman.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.300
Ah, who we?

18:17.300 --> 18:18.300
Hmm.

18:18.300 --> 18:19.300
Ah.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.300
Now I say, movement's all ready up and about.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.300
What?

18:24.300 --> 18:26.300
Ah, hi, Snuff!

18:26.300 --> 18:28.300
Oh, it's you, you're awake.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.300
I'm glad I didn't blow my whistle.

18:30.300 --> 18:33.300
But we did have a reason to be worried, Inspector.

18:33.300 --> 18:34.300
He's right.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.300
What about, moment, Mama?

18:35.300 --> 18:37.300
And, moment, Papa?

18:37.300 --> 18:39.300
Oh, there, everybody.

18:39.300 --> 18:40.300
Is anything the matter?

18:40.300 --> 18:41.300
Nothing at all.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.300
There are weak.

18:42.300 --> 18:44.300
Oh, dear, I don't understand.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.300
You don't understand words.

18:45.300 --> 18:49.300
We were very worried because you just wouldn't wake up.

18:49.300 --> 18:50.300
Oh, really?

18:50.300 --> 18:52.300
You do know we always have a night, don't you?

18:52.300 --> 18:55.300
We sleep all winter, and we always wake up in the spring.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.300
Of course, of course, but this year, start your turn.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.300
Right, well, we did have a bit of a problem.

19:00.300 --> 19:03.300
You see, moment, Papa, we couldn't swim.

19:03.300 --> 19:04.300
Snuffkin.

19:04.300 --> 19:05.300
You're back already.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.300
Yes.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.300
Why don't you listen to us, moment, Papa?

19:08.300 --> 19:09.300
Very well.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.300
Why don't you come in and we'll have a nice cup of tea,

19:12.300 --> 19:15.300
and then we can discuss your problem properly.

19:15.300 --> 19:18.300
But it's your problem, I'm afraid, not ours.

19:18.300 --> 19:19.300
What does he mean?

19:19.300 --> 19:21.300
We don't have a problem, do we?

19:21.300 --> 19:24.300
Please do come in anyway, everybody.

19:24.300 --> 19:25.300
Please.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.300
You too.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.300
All of you, come in.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.300
Come in, everybody.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.300
I'm on the side.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.300
I'm in Georgia.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.300
Whatever happened was this year.

19:42.300 --> 19:43.300
Hey, Snuffkin.

19:51.300 --> 19:52.300
Alicia!

19:52.300 --> 19:53.300
Alicia!

19:53.300 --> 19:54.300
Alicia!

19:59.300 --> 20:00.300
Oh, man!

20:00.300 --> 20:02.300
We've come to see you, Alicia.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.300
That was nice of you.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.300
Your grandmother isn't home, is she?

20:07.300 --> 20:08.300
No.

20:08.300 --> 20:10.300
Then we can play hide and seek.

20:10.300 --> 20:11.300
I can't.

20:11.300 --> 20:13.300
I promise grandma there.

20:13.300 --> 20:15.300
Yes, I know. Snuffkin told me.

20:15.300 --> 20:17.300
That was a really great thing to do.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.300
But you didn't promise not to see us.

20:19.300 --> 20:22.300
You just promised not to go to Mom and Valley, didn't you?

20:22.300 --> 20:23.300
Yeah.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.300
And listen, you never promised not to play with us either, did you?

20:26.300 --> 20:27.300
No.

20:27.300 --> 20:30.300
So, if we came here to see you instead of you to us,

20:30.300 --> 20:33.300
then it's all right, and you don't have to break your promise.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.300
Oh, I suppose so.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.300
Yes, I suppose you're right.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.300
Well, let's play.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.300
Yay!

20:42.300 --> 20:48.300
13, 4, 3, 5, 8!

21:01.300 --> 21:06.300
That afternoon, they all had the most wonderful time playing hide and seek in the woods.

21:06.300 --> 21:08.300
Ha-ha-ha!

21:08.300 --> 21:12.300
One, two, three,

21:12.300 --> 21:14.300
your tiniest hour.

21:14.300 --> 21:20.300
Five, six, seven,

21:20.300 --> 21:23.300
ha-ha-ha-ha!

21:23.300 --> 21:29.300
Mine, ten, eleven.

21:29.300 --> 21:39.300
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements,

21:39.300 --> 21:47.300
believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

21:47.300 --> 21:51.300
They're always happy and goes at play.

21:51.300 --> 21:58.300
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

21:58.300 --> 22:08.300
The movements, the movements.
