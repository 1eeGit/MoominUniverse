1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Therefore you want your TV.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So what do you want? with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:28,000 --> 00:02:08,740

This is Mum and House. It has been raining since lunchtime, and the moment and his friends spent all afternoon

9
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:15,120
in the moment house, waiting for the sun to come out.

10
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,800
So, Tukki's arrival was very welcome.

11
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Good evening, Mom.

12
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:45,000
Tukki, come here. Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy one there. Yes, there is. You just can't see her.

13
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Really?

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes, I'm afraid she's very, very shy.

15
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll leave the door open for you, Ninny. Come in when you're ready.

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She'll get soaked if she stays out there.

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Maybe that doesn't matter very much if you're invisible.

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh.

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Too ticky. How nice. You're not that very much if you're invisible. Oh.

20
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Too ticky. How nice.

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What is everyone looking at?

22
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
About Nini, you know sometimes when people are very frightened, they can become invisible to the people around them.

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Poor Nini, she's looked after by an aunt who doesn't like her and is really horrible to her and who only does it because she thinks it's her duty.

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It wouldn't be so bad if she just got mad and yelled at her, but she's cold and sarcastic, which is much worse.

25
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,400
She doesn't care if Minnie is unhappy,

26
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
and gives her horrible jobs.

27
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,439
What sarcastic?

28
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,280
Uh, let's see.

29
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,840
Suppose you tripped and fell over.

30
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,280
What would Mum and Mama say?

31
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,960
Well, she does me a fight hurt myself.

32
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,159
Yes, well, you're lucky that Mum and Mama is so nice,

33
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,360
but a lot of people would be mad at you.

34
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,500
Now, this nasty old lady would say,

35
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,599
that may be your idea of dancing,

36
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,000
but try not to do it when people are eaten please.

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Gosh, that's horrible.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Anyway, she just went on being more and more horrible to her,

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
so that in the end,

40
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Nini was so upset she became invisible.

41
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,439
On our answer, she couldn't be bothered to look after little girl she couldn't see.

42
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,759
Poor Nanny.

43
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,399
So she asked me to do it.

44
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,959
Nanny's still outside.

45
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,399
Too nervous to come in.

46
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,399
But what did you do to this old aunt?

47
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,319
I hope you told her she heard Nanny's feelings.

48
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,000
He wouldn't have done any good, not with someone like her.

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So I took nanny home, and then as you're the nicest family I know,

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I brought her here so you could make her visible again.

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We're very flattered, of course, too, Tiki. But...

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If anyone can do it, you and Mum and Mom again, and Mum and come play with her.

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Does she talk at all to Tiki?

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,079
I'm afraid not.

55
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,240
Not since she became invisible.

56
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,399
Oh, dear.

57
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm sure I can think of lots of games,

58
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,279
but it'll be hard to play if I can't see her.

59
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,800
She'll be really good at hiding seat, though.

60
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,079
Oh, it's OK.

61
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,079
You'll know where she is because her aunt hung a little bell

62
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,839
around her neck.

63
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,800
Oh, look, the door's opened.

64
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,959
That'll be Nanny.

65
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,000
Come here, Nanny.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,120
It's all right.

67
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,439
Don't be frightened.

68
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,560
Come and meet everyone.

69
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,199
This is your new home.

70
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,399
And this is Mom and Mama and Mom and Papa.

71
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,199
They're both very nice.

72
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,800
Hello, I'm Mom and these are my friends.

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,800
We were just having some tea. Would you like some?

74
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Oh, that is, if you can drink.

75
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh, perhaps I should make some lemonade.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Well, now, perhaps you'd all like to go back to the table, if you'd care to sit down and eat.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sorry I don't know any more about her,

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
but I'm sure that everything will be okay now she's here.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,540
I'm certain it will.

80
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,339
We'll do our best, Tiki.

81
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,680
Here you are, Nini.

82
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:39,939
Well, she seems to be okay now,

83
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:41,959
so I better be getting along.

84
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,839
I've got a lot of things to do.

85
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,319
I'll try and come over to see how you're all going.

86
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,920
That would really be nice.

87
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,759
Oh, it's better.

88
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,040
You have got room, haven't you?

89
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,279
Didn't you have someone else stand?

90
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,360
Oh, yes.

91
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,839
The thing I mean, Bob, but it's all right.

92
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,240
They left last week. That's okay then.

93
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:13,279
Oh, you must have been thirsty.

94
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,720
Would you like some more?

95
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:27,000
Sure. Oh, are you coming up with me?

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's nice, Nanny.

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This is your very own room.

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You'll be warm and cozy.

99
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm going to get you some food.

100
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm going to get you some food.

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm going to get you some food.

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm going to get you some food. This is your very own room.

103
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You'll be warm and cozy here.

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I've put the lemonade on the table so you can have a drink whenever you want.

105
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Are you sure you wouldn't like something to eat?

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Ah, I see, you want to go to bed.

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Well, you had a busy day, so you must be tired out.

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And don't forget, if you feel frightened or lonely during the night,

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
just come and wake me up and we'll have a talk.

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If you like, you can tinkle your little bell in my ear,

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and that should do it, many dear.

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,199
Sweet dreams. Sleep well.

113
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,000
She asleep?

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I was wondering whether there's anything that might help her in your granny's book of household remedies.

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't know if there's a cure for invisibility. I can't remember, but I'll have a look.

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There's a remedy for most things.

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm a phone believer in granny's remedy.

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I know you are dear. I'll go and see.

120
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I wonder what you looked like.

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,840
Hmm. Hmm. Ah, there it is.

122
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Now then, a droopy tail, evil eye, melancholy.

123
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:35,399
Ah, this must be it. The prescription was at the end of the book and shakily written, but it looked like the

124
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,799
right one.

125
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:43,399
It said, remedy for when people start getting misty and difficult to see.

126
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,000
It was very complicated. Do you think it's going to work, Mama? Granny's remedies usually do, so don't worry.

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes, you're right.

128
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I wonder whether we are going to get a new one.

129
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm going to get a new one.

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm going to get a new one.

131
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm going to get a new one.

132
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm going to get a new one.

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm going to get a new one.

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm going to get a new one.

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm going to get a new one. I'm going to work, Mama? Granny's remedies usually do, so don't worry.

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes, you're right.

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I wonder whether we ought to go and wake her up.

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh! Look, you can save many shoes.

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Papa! Papa!

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh, good morning, little my.

141
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Is Ninny up yet?

142
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yes, she's up.

143
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm going to get some food.

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm going to get some food. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop! Oh, good morning, little mind.

145
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Is Ninny up yet?

146
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah, she is.

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Where is she? She hasn't eaten yet, has she?

148
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't know, and she's probably at the dining room.

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, no!

150
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hmm? I'm too late! I'd be quiet, you two. Minnie's just finishing her breakfast.

151
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Come on, drink it all up.

152
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's good.

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It should start to work in a couple of hours.

154
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Well done, Minnie.

155
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Look, her shoes are floating!

156
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, the seal will be seeing the rest of her.

157
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,039
Ha! I should start to work in a couple of hours. Well done, nitty. Look, her shoes are floating.

158
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah, the seal will be seeing the rest of her.

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,799
Ha, they look silly.

160
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,919
I think they're very nice feet.

161
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,120
I know, Wum and Mama's remedies are good,

162
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,320
but I can't see them working that fast.

163
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,879
Anyway, you must look pretty bad

164
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,960
if you want to make yourself invisible.

165
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,080
Don't let Little My Up said you, nitty.

166
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,000
It's only the way she talks.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
She doesn't mean it.

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh, yes I do.

169
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm bored, Moomin.

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Well, what shall we do then, Moomin?

171
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't know.

172
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Let's go mushroom picking.

173
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's boring. I never find any.

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Well, I do.

175
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Would you like to come, nanny?

176
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Good. And we can see who can pick the most, shall we?

177
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
They all look the same to me, so you'll have to tell me which ones are safe to eat.

178
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll tell you! Papa! Papa! Look, Papa! You can see many shoes now.

179
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, that's good. There's not many things Mama's potions won't cure.

180
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, it can't be that. She only took it a minute ago.

181
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It might be that it works faster if you're completely invisible.

182
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,100
I think it's being away from that horrid ant. Yes, it might be that it works faster if you're completely invisible. I think it's being away from that horrid ant.

183
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,799
Yes, it could be.

184
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:51,399
Mama, we're taking nanny mushroom picking.

185
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,899
Have a nice time.

186
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,100
Morning!

187
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
Morning!

188
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,899
Hi!

189
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:57,899
Hello.

190
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:12,000
Where's Nanny?

191
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh!

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Huh! Wow, what a lot of mushrooms! You seem to know where to find all the best ones, Neely.

193
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's not fair. I haven't gotten half as many.

194
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
How are you doing, Momen?

195
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Wow, that must be about four times as long as you're here. It's not fair. I haven't gotten half as many. How are you doing, Momen?

196
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Ugh.

197
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,480
Wow, that must be about four times as many as I've got.

198
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,039
Uh, yeah, that's right.

199
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:57,480
You've never picked that many before.

200
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,320
You know, Momen, I think there's something fishy about this.

201
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,000
Uh-huh. So they're not yours at all.

202
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Well, not really, no.

203
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Ninny's enjoyed herself.

204
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I bet her yak-y old aunt never let her go mushroom picking.

205
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
She was probably only allowed to carry the baskets,

206
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
the really heavy ones.

207
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, how awful for her.

208
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,340
They're stinky.

209
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,940
What's he up to now?

210
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,940
I'll take care of him.

211
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,580
Hello, moment, long time no see.

212
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,779
Not long enough.

213
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:38,580
Last time you dipped my swimming shorts in glue.

214
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,179
You know I thought that was very funny.

215
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:44,379
Hey, what's that basket floating around up there for?

216
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:47,679
I don't want to be rude, but mind your own business.

217
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,360
It looks like the Hobgoblins work. Boy, just think of all the things you could do if you were invisible.

218
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,919
Minnie, I'll carry your basket. Let's go.

219
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,960
It stinks here.

220
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,879
Hey, you! Isn't it me a name or just a description?

221
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:05,200
What's wrong is your voice invisible, too?

222
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,899
Please stop it, stinky.

223
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,899
Can't you see you're frightening her?

224
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:10,700
Oh, it's a girl, is it?

225
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,299
Why doesn't she speak for herself?

226
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:13,299
She's stupid.

227
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:16,299
What a perfect name for her, Nini.

228
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,100
Now look, stinky.

229
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,500
Oh, yes, Moonman. Now look what?

230
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,299
You stop upsetting Nini or I'll get really angry.

231
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,919
Without those feet, she'd be perfect for a bank robbery.

232
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,360
Well she's getting visible again,

233
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,759
so she'll be no good to you at all, Stinky.

234
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,440
You couldn't see any of her yesterday, not even the feet.

235
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,559
Oh, oh.

236
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,799
They're disappearing again.

237
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh, you have to's gone! It's all your fault, Stinky.

238
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yes, and like I told you before,

239
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
she'd make a brilliant bank robber.

240
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Don't you agree?

241
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Perfect!

242
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah!

243
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Nanny would never do such a thing as that.

244
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And anyway, Mama's given her one of Granny's magic remedies.

245
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:11,000
She'll soon be visible again, so they're there.

246
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Whose basket is this? Mine in little mice.

247
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Well, there's not many of them, but they certainly are pretty.

248
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
There weren't many left for us to get, because Nanny has picked them all.

249
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,919
It doesn't really matter how many you've got,

250
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,200
because you can't eat them.

251
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,799
Let me show you.

252
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:32,320
Now, this is deadly, tuffed at Toadstool.

253
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,840
And this is Cow's Bane.

254
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,120
You must remember what they look like.

255
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,639
These are movements and sniff, I should think.

256
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,799
We didn't pick any poisoners ones.

257
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:45,000
Not quite as many as Snork Maiden and Little My,

258
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
but this is body flybane and insiduous pepper spunk,

259
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and you've both got cow'sbane too, you must be more careful.

260
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Now this is better, there's not one mushroom in here that you can't eat.

261
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
How did Ninny manage to do this all on her own?

262
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What a very clever girl she is.

263
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,880
Ninny, where are you? Come here a minute.

264
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,000
Nini, didn't you hear? Mama wants you.

265
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,799
Nini, this is a beautiful mushroom basket. We'll have a feast tonight.

266
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,000
Her feet have come back!

267
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh, I'm so glad. We, soon be able to see your face!

268
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It won't take long at all, Ninny,

269
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and you mustn't worry about stinky one little bit.

270
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
He's all talk!

271
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
If something upsets you just think of something else,

272
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
at least that's my philosophy in life.

273
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
If somebody upsets you,

274
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
ignore him! That's my philosophy, Ninny!

275
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,059
Anyone who picks mushrooms like this deserves to be seen.

276
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,900
You mustn't let anything frighten you when you're with us.

277
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,200
Do you understand?

278
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Oh!

279
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.

280
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,640
That's just great, nanny.

281
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,440
Oh, that's wonderful, nanny, wonderful.

282
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,480
I can't wait to see all of you.

283
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,880
It won't be long now, but I don't think

284
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,119
Mouse Gray is quite your color, you know.

285
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You just sleep as long as you like, Nanny. Good night now. If you want anything, you just shout. Oh Hmm Oh, where's Mum and Mama?

286
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Well, well, what are you doing? Do you know what time it is?

287
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Do you like this, Moomin Papa?

288
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Hmm.

289
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes, it's very nice.

290
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's good to have someone in the house to make clothes for it last.

291
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I hope it'll look pretty on her.

292
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What's this for?

293
00:19:39,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Her hair. There. Good morning, Moomin, Papa. Good morning, little Mai. You're very early today.

294
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Where's Nini?

295
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Still in bed.

296
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You're a burly?

297
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I can't wait to see her.

298
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Come on, man.

299
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm going to get some food.

300
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm going to get some food.

301
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm going to get some food.

302
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm going to get some food.

303
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm going to get some food.

304
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm going to get some food.

305
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,240
I'm going to get some food. I'm't wait to see her. Come on, man.

306
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,880
It's like waiting for Christmas, isn't it? Yeah, I like having presents every day.

307
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,720
Isn't it, Papa?

308
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,960
Well, I think it's much more exciting this way.

309
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,720
We have to wait until she's ready to come down.

310
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,000
Did you hear that door opening? She's awake!

311
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I hope she found the dress where I left it on the table. Oh, good. okay, I suppose.

312
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Thank you all very much for everything.

313
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh! Ha! So she can talk!

314
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
They still couldn't see Nini's face. But at least they knew that she was there,

315
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
that she was talking to them.

316
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It made them all feel a lot better.

317
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Stork made them look! They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements

318
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements

319
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
They're always happy and always at play.

320
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

321
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The movements.

322
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The movements.
