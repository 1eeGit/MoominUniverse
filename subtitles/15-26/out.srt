1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Oh, what exactly is it you're observing?

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,500
I'm sure I saw a beautiful crayfish in there.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,500
Crayfish? Excuse me, young man, but that is zoology.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Quite the most uninteresting field.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,500
There it is.

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:49,500
Oh! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

7
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I got him! I got him!

8
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,500
I got him!

9
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
A dragon?

10
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Papa!

11
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Oh, what have you got there?

12
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Oh, oh, nothing, Papa.

13
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Everything's so fresh after the rain.

14
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Oh, woman.

15
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Yes, it is.

16
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,000
I've got to show this to Snuffkin before anybody else sees it.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,500
Boom, moment!

18
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
What have you got there, Moomin?

19
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all, little lie.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, yes, you have, I saw it. Don't lie to me.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's just one of Mom's old jars.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Liar, liar, I know there's something.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't think there's nothing.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Then why are you hiding it?

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, right, little mice. See me, it's not fair.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Dragon.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Ah, yeah, I was right.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
They must be a baby dragon.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Probably the very last one on Earth and washed up by the rain.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
A dragon of my own.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, that's wonderful.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh, I hope I didn't frighten you.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I know what I'll do.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I know what I'll do.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I know what I'll do.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I know what I'll do.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I know what I'll do.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I know what I'll do.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll take the lid off the jar so you can get some fresh air, little dragon.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
See? That better, isn't it?

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Come on, little fella.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We'll give you a car to make you feel better.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Ow!

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, that burnt me!

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What a fierce little dragon you are.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't worry.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll look after you.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll take good care of you.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And when you're bigger and start to like me, I'll take you swimming in the sea.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You must be starving.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll get you something from my nighttime emergency food box.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I've got lots of things in there.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's bound to be something you like.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The one.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Take anything you want.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Gosh, that's really clever, little dragon.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Move it. Lunch is ready.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Gummy!

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Now you stay here.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't worry. I'll be back in no time at all.

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Remember, you're my own little dragon.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Where's sniff?

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I thought he was here as well.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He's collecting worms for fishing.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He'll be here soon.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We'll start without him then.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You know, Mama, certain people keep secrets in glass jars.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Secrets?

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, yes, a little secret that hisses.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Moment, Mama, I found this near the big puddle.

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Thank you, sniff.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Moment, I told you I wanted it back.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's my very best one.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Sorry, Mama.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I was so excited.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I must have left it when I found...

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I mean, when I was...

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And I'm sure you know who I mean by certain people.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Did you catch anything with the sieve, Moment?

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes, he did. Something that's now hidden in his room.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Big mouth.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If it's a secret, little my.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Perhaps he doesn't want to tell anyone.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, probably because his new pet bites.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well, it hasn't bitten you yet, hasn't it?

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If it did, I'd bite it back.

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Is it true? Does your secret really bite people?

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Well, it couldn't bite very hard.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If it was small enough to go in a jar, could it, Papa?

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I suppose certain people might keep other small things in jars,

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
beetles and spiders, mosquitoes, scorpions, or poisonous centipedes,

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
horrible things that multiply and multiply every week

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and grow and grow until the jars are too small.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
See? Like that.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And there'll be so many of them, thousands and thousands

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and they'll take over moving valley and eat us all.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh, well, I haven't got a centipede.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hmm, I wonder if centipedes come from outer space.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But this is the earth deer.

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The rain could have brought them down from space, Mama, couldn't it?

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, you could be right. It was raining very hard yesterday.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And it wasn't like ordinary rain.

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I saw a puddle as big as a lake.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What's the matter, movement?

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It isn't a centipede.

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Ha, we're on the right track, though.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Well, I'm glad it's not a poisonous centipede.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I shouldn't have liked that.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, you're asleep.

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Moomin's little dragon.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is it okay if I go see snuffkin, Mama?

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Have you finished already?

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes, I have.

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Tell them they mustn't go into my room.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Or they'll have to take the consequence, sis.

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
All right, Moomin, I'll make sure no one goes in there.

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I promise.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, but he's gonna tell snuffkin' this secret.

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I should think he is.

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Best friends always come first, little my.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hey, snuffkin.

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Hi.

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Fishing again?

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yep.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The cards told me that if I caught five menos, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
South?

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're joking.

130
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Not at all. I believe in the cards.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But snuffkin, winter's not here yet.

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I know that, but the cards tell you things for a reason, Moomin.

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, do they really?

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But it would be awfully few when you waste snuffkin.

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Just awful.

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I mean, I'd be very lonely.

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, anyway, who would I talk to or tell my secrets to?

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh, snuffkin, quickly.

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You must come back to Moomin house.

140
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now?

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah.

142
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, I suppose I could fish later.

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No, no. There's no point.

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But I have to catch five menos.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh.

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The fish won't bite after all is rain.

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You'd catch nothing.

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It'll be better to wait until it stops flowing so fast.

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Well, perhaps you're right.

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So what's this big secret all about?

151
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hey, Moomin.

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Have you ever seen a dragon snuffkin?

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No, of course not.

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
They all disappeared off the face of the earth many hundreds of years ago.

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But perhaps they didn't all disappear.

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What if there was one alive somewhere?

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's impossible.

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It could be so small that it would go in a glass jar snuffkin.

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Are you sure you're not daydreaming, Moomin?

160
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But still, anything is possible, I suppose.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But you know me.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I have to see it right in front of me before I believe it.

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, where is it?

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Mama promised me that she wouldn't let anyone in.

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'd not hear either.

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Well, you were right, Moomin.

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What?

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Ah, there he is.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think you've found a real dragon.

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
How do you get up there?

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He mustn't fall.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He might lose his tail.

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Don't move, little dragon.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And snuffkin, keep quiet.

175
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You might get frightened and do something silly.

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Don't worry, I'll soon have you down.

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
This will do. I'll lay it on the floor here.

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Jump, little dragon.

179
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't be afraid.

180
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Come on, hold onto this and we'll bring you down slowly.

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Don't panic.

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't think it's a very good idea, Moomin.

183
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You'll only scare him away.

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Why don't you just leave him alone?

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He'll come down when he's ready.

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Dragons aren't helpless, you know, even little baby ones.

187
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But he's so small.

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Come to Moomin.

189
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Come on, don't you understand?

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Hold onto that and I'll listen to you.

191
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ah!

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Ah!

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Ah!

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Ah!

195
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Ah!

196
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Look at him!

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
My dragon, come fly!

198
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He's flying!

199
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He's flying!

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Come down, little dragon.

201
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You might question or something.

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Come down!

203
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh!

204
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Be careful, snuffkin.

205
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He might bite!

206
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't think so.

207
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He's a very unusual pet.

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I think he likes you more than me.

209
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Ah!

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What a charming little creature, Moomin.

211
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He's lovely.

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What's his name?

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He's called Little Dragon.

214
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Ha!

215
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't think he's lovely at all.

216
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Small but savage, if you ask my opinion.

217
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That sounds just like you, little mind.

218
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You think so?

219
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Ow!

220
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah!

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
No, oh, oh, oh.

222
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh!

223
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Now look here.

224
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Ah!

225
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He seems to have a thing about ears, doesn't he?

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Step snuffkins, why doesn't he bite him?

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Go on, dragon.

228
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Go on, baby!

229
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He's really tasty!

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Go on!

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Good news, I think he's trying to heat up snuffkins coffee.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He must really like him.

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Cleve a little thing.

234
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, I hope he's careful with that hot breath.

235
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We don't want to start a fire.

236
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
All right, that's enough.

237
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He might be useful.

238
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
When he's bigger, we can put him in the cellar

239
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and he'll be able to keep the whole house just like a furnace.

240
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
No, we will not.

241
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Go away!

242
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You passed!

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Ow!

244
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And you!

245
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He only thought you were trying to get his fly.

246
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll get him if he bites me again.

247
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Just you watch me do it.

248
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Come on, little dragon.

249
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm sure that'll keep him quiet.

250
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'd better go.

251
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Thanks for the coffee, Mumma.

252
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh no, it'll suffocate him.

253
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He only seems to like snuffkin.

254
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Well, we all like snuffkin.

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Stupid old dragon.

256
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
No, he isn't.

257
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Mum and dear, why don't you take him to your room?

258
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
He'll be happier there.

259
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
This will be best for him.

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, I wonder if he'll come back to visit us.

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Why did you do that?

262
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
He was cute and we could have always worn earmuffs.

263
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You can visit him in snuffkin's tent.

264
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I expect little dragons already sitting on his shoulder.

265
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It doesn't matter anyway.

266
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Snuffkin's going south soup.

267
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
They'll be able to go together.

268
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh, my dear, Mumma.

269
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Never mind.

270
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Well, you're a bit of a problem.

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't want you here, little dragon.

272
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Come on, go away.

273
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Go to Mumma.

274
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Don't do that.

275
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, come on, please go to Mumma.

276
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Look, you're very nice and it'll be fun to have you along.

277
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But there's Mumma.

278
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And he'd know you were here and you'd be upset.

279
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Oh, there's another one.

280
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That's the fifth.

281
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Oh, dear.

282
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Hmm?

283
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Any luck?

284
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Not bad.

285
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Are you going far?

286
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Oh, I'm fair away.

287
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Would you like some fresh fish?

288
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm sure you'll get hungry.

289
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah, what do you want in return?

290
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
A small favor.

291
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Take this as far as you can, open the lid and just leave it.

292
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What? Just leave it?

293
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yes, in a nice quiet place, with lots and lots of flies.

294
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Flies? What's in there?

295
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
A dragon.

296
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
A dragon? Does it bite?

297
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Well, it might.

298
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This is a big favor.

299
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't even like minnows.

300
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh, they're not too bad.

301
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
If you roast them, keep the lid on.

302
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But make sure you open it up later so it can catch the flies.

303
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
All right, as long as it doesn't try to bite me.

304
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Don't worry, it won't.

305
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Hello.

306
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Hi.

307
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, oh, oh.

308
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Where is he?

309
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Who is that?

310
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
My dragon.

311
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
He must have come here, snuffkin.

312
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, really?

313
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I thought he was home with you, sleeping in your room.

314
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
No, I let him out.

315
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Ah, well, dragons are very fickle.

316
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
All they really care about is big fat flies.

317
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's best to forget about a movement.

318
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Did you catch your five minnows?

319
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No, you were right. The water is too fast.

320
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, really?

321
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So I won't go south until winter comes.

322
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You'll stay here then?

323
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Well, I'm sure it wouldn't do to go against the cards.

324
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Now what a movement, my friend.

325
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Oh, that's great. You're staying snuffkin.

326
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Fantastic. That's really, really good.

327
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Ah, perhaps I shouldn't have painted the float bright red.

328
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It might have scared those little minnows right away.

329
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Okay, let's go.

330
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah.

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That dragon was sort of stupid.

332
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Baby dragons are.

333
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
They make the world's worst pets.

334
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
They never want to settle in one place.

335
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah, you're right.

336
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It was very funny, though, when it bit little mice here.

337
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I think it gave her a taste of her own medicine.

338
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The movement was very happy that snuffkin was staying in movement valley

339
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and not going south until winter.

340
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And as for the dragon, well, who wants to be loved by a silly old dragon?

341
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

342
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

343
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
They're always happy and always at play.

344
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

345
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The movements.

346
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The movements.

347
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

348
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

349
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
They're always happy and always at play.

350
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

351
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The movements.

352
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The movements.

353
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The movements.

354
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Here they are for one and all.

355
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The movements are about to come.

356
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

357
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Here for you on your TV, they are the movements.

358
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
They are the movements.

359
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So come with me, give me your hand.

360
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'll take you up to a moment land.

361
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You can fly just like a bird.

362
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Sing that song ever.

363
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
There were the movements.

364
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
There were the movements.

365
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
There were the movements.

366
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
There were the movements.

367
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
There was the movements.

368
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
There were the movements.

369
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:19,000
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

370
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The weather was far too beautiful for Moomin Papa to concentrate on writing his memoirs, so he went for a walk instead. Good morning, Mr. Hamilton. Ah, Moomin Papa. Have you found a new plan or something? I'm afraid not, and I think I must have examined every single plan in Moomin Valley. I know what you mean. There isn't a single person living here that I don't know. Ah, yes, yes, quite. Look, why don't you come over and have a conversation?

371
00:21:49,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The top of tea, Mr. Hamilton. Hmm? Isn't that Moomin and Little My? Yes, I think it is. Really, Moomin Papa, peeping into people's homes. Oh, it's an empty house, Mr. Hamilton.

372
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Moomin, what are you looking at? Oh, hello, Papa. Nobody's lived in there for years. Somebody's just moved in. Oh, really? Let me have a look. Oh, goodness. How tidy they are. Perhaps the children will play with us. Oh, they might, but they seem a bit too well behaved for that. I must have a closer look at them. Me too, Moomin Papa, but the trouble is they never come outside the fence. Well, in that case, we'll have to go in.

373
00:22:48,000 --> 00:23:18,000
How do we do that, Papa? We can't just walk in there. See, you want to borrow some sugar? That should do it. Oh, Mr. Hamilton, where's your imagination? Will you please lend me your magnifying glass? But surely. Here it is. Oh, that should do it. What are you going to do, Papa? Now then, you all stay out here. My plan will only work.

374
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Look, if it looks as though I'm on my own. Oh, but what is your plan, Papa? I hope Papa knows what he's doing. They don't look that friendly to me. Me neither.

375
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Mama, there's someone coming. Oh, what do you want, my good man? Come on, tell me quickly. Do you hear me? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't think anyone lived here.

376
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Well, we do know you know we just moved in. Really? Oh, do forgive me, Madam. I certainly didn't mean to trespass. Ah, so what are you doing here in the garden, man?

377
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm researching the travel system of ants. I didn't know they had one. Oh, yeah, yeah, it's fascinating. How they find their way and build their roads, and they're not here now, of course. But this is their main road. It's very quiet at the moment, but at busy times, it's packed.

378
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm afraid I can't see any main road. Oh, you would if you were an expert. Anyway, I'll point it out to you next time they're on the move if I'm in the vicinity, of course. But it's worth looking out for.

379
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley. I'm your next door neighbor, although we live quite a long way away. I'm Moomin. Ah, so you must be Moomin Papa, aren't you?

380
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Ah, yes, that's me. How did you know? Did someone mention my name to you?

381
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:10,000
We were told the movements were a bit unusual. Very nice, they said, though. How very flattering. Thank you. And you're Mrs.

382
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Philly Junk, mother and housewife. Well, it's an honor to meet you. Mrs. Philly Junk. Well done, Papa. It looks like you found us some new friends to play with. Oh, welcome party.

383
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Don't you think it's a good idea? We haven't had a party for ages, Mama. But you hardly know them, and I've never even met them.

384
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But Mama, how can we show them that they're really welcome and they could meet everyone at a party, couldn't they?

385
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And I could take care of all the children. I know just what to do. Splendid, Moomin. Ah, Mr. Heaven, I know Moomin Papa. You'd like me to do the fireworks.

386
00:25:49,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It looks like we're throwing a party. We'll have lots of pretty flowers. Just tell me what you want, Mama, and we'll do it.

387
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It's great. Those kids will just love it. If they survive, Moomin.

388
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Now then, children, the Moomin's are all a little bit odd, so behead properly. Yes, mother, we will. They'll be here soon. Take this in, Moomin.

389
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Okay. The shoot works really well. Oh, good. I must try it. These look nice. Oh, stiff. Leave them alone, will you?

390
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Oh, all right. Just this one. They're here. Come on, everybody. They'll soon be at the door.

391
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Right. Come on, children. Help me with the flowers. Oh, dear. Fireworks now are later on. Oh, later on. I think you'll very hold finally.

392
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Welcome to Moomin House, Mrs. Fitzgerald. It was very kind of you to invite us, Moomin, Mama. Come in, please, and make yourselves at home. Oh, thank you all very much indeed.

393
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley. All in my hair. It looks very untidy. Doesn't it, mother?

394
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's a surprise. They should have been rose buds, but we couldn't find any at all. Oh, yes. Dear, what a mess. Mrs. Philly chunk, let me introduce the children.

395
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:18,000
They all look different. Well, yes. Only Moomin is really ours. The others are sort of, I'm sure they'll all get on. Oh, I'm afraid my children do not play. They would much rather read or study.

396
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Oh, are you sure they've got to have some time for play? I'm sure. Well, come into the dining room anyway. You can watch the others play. Make sure the chairs are clean. Yes, mother, we will.

397
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Won't you let them play at all? No, I will not. Come on, everybody. Wouldn't you like to have a go on our slide? No.

398
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Hmm. You'd really enjoy it once you got going. I know you would. No, thank you. No, no, not at all. No, definitely not.

399
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And you're really quite sure, are you? Yes. I thought so. Then we've got it all to ourselves.

400
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Moomin sounds like he's having fun.

401
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Oh, and that's little May and sniff. Your children seem very quiet, Mrs. Billy Junk. Good children are seen and not heard right here.

402
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That was one of mine. And that was another. Well, it sounds like they're having fun for once.

403
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
To have a biscuit, Mrs. Billy Junk. They have an unusual taste. I'd run out of flowers, so I used them.

404
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Oh, don't worry, move them and look after them. Go on, it's your turn now.

405
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:35,000
My children. Stop it, it's too dangerous. You might hurt yourself.

406
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Oh, come on, stop it at once. Now, don't you worry, Mrs. Billy Junk. I've got ointment in my bag if they hurt themselves.

407
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But you'll hear mother.

408
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Stop children, you hear me. We're going home now. Stop it.

409
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I think it's time for the glorious finale, Papa.

410
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I can't say I wasn't warned. Exposing them to this, Moomin Valley is no place for proper children. No place at all. Oh, dear, what's this?

411
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:37,000
There are fireworks in your honor. Fireworks. I made them especially to welcome you.

412
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Goodbye, come back soon. Maybe tomorrow. No, you will not.

413
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I don't think Mrs. Billy Junk enjoyed her party. She's very lucky that I didn't bite her.

414
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
She should have had a go on the slide. I'm sure she would have loved it, and then she wouldn't have shouted at her children.

415
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Don't, don't slide down, shoot, sniff. They're too afraid of looking silly.

416
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Oh, oh, Papa. Oh, I'm very sorry, Moomin, but don't worry, I'll fix it. It is nothing much broken.

417
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,000
What happened, my dear? Well, I thought it had been such a long time since I'd been on the slide that I'd have a go.

418
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I didn't think I'd be too heavy for it. I know. When we mend it, why don't we make it strong enough for me and Mama to play on as well? I think she'd like that.

419
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
That's a good idea, Papa, but we want to use it too.

420
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And that's a cool idea. I just try it out, now and again.

421
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I want you to stay here while I'm out. What if somebody asks us to play?

422
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,000
What do you mean? Play. I hope you're not thinking of the Moomins, are you?

423
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I don't want you mixing with those noisy children ever again. Do you hear me?

424
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Where are you going, mother? To look for another house. It was a terrible mistake coming to Moomin Valley.

425
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Look, there's Mrs. Philly drunk. Good afternoon. Please stay away from my children.

426
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Oh, but why? We thought they might like to come and have an adventure with us.

427
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh, never mind. Let's go.

428
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Hey, hang on a minute.

429
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh, you're Tarsam.

430
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I can't see. It's too late for you now, snap.

431
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Oh, no, not the hungry crocodile at the bottom of the courtyard.

432
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
We should have brought the Philly Junks with us. But Moomin missed his Philly Junks.

433
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
We need looked older. Have you been killed and eaten yet, Sniff?

434
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
No, I fell on top of the crocodile and knocked him out and then swam.

435
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Sniff, but I thought you couldn't swim.

436
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
On your own business.

437
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Hey, that looks like the Philly Junks.

438
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Why don't they come over here?

439
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I bet their mother told them not to talk to us. See if I care you.

440
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Hey, what are you doing? Why aren't you playing with Moomin and the others?

441
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I don't think they want to play with us.

442
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
They didn't call for us when they went past.

443
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Stinky's arrived and wonder what he's doing here.

444
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I bet you it's no fun stuck in that garden.

445
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
No, we'd rather be out here playing.

446
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Well, I know somewhere much better than Moomin's. It's a great place to play.

447
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Do you?

448
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yes, would I lie to you? It's a bit of a way off, but it'll be really exciting and lots of fun so do you want to come or not.

449
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Well, it is a bit boring here.

450
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yes, very.

451
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Oh, do you really think they don't want to play with us? Doesn't it look like it?

452
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Your brother's absolutely right, so come on if you're coming because I can't wait.

453
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
What stinky up to? I don't trust him.

454
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Okay, now this is the place I told you about. Good, isn't it?

455
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Now, if you hang on to that rope, you can swing over to the other side and back again.

456
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Don't worry, it's quite safe.

457
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
That's great. I've never been anywhere like this.

458
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
A bit frightening.

459
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Without the thrill, where's the fun?

460
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You need a bit of danger to spice it up.

461
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Gee, Willikers, it looks like the other side is higher than this side.

462
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Yes, I bet. It's all right. You just have to put your legs up, that's all.

463
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Who wants to go first?

464
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I've got it. Why don't you all go together?

465
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
What? The three of us?

466
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
See, this way you won't feel so scared, will you?

467
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
No, not together.

468
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Well, why don't you go one at a time then? That way it's always more fun.

469
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Can you do it, Stinky?

470
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Don't be silly. Of course I can. I do it all at a time. One of the things I'm best at.

471
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Even if I do say so myself.

472
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So, why don't you show us, Stinky?

473
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Move him!

474
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I didn't know you were such a rope, Stinky. I'm sure he didn't either.

475
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So, this is your usual place, isn't it?

476
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Well, sort of.

477
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
You know something. If you hadn't said that you'd done this lots of times,

478
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I wouldn't have believed that I could have done it myself.

479
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Come on, Stinky. Show us how you do it.

480
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
If you go first, I'll be second.

481
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
No, it's all right. You can go first, Mom.

482
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
But I want to see how it's done. Then throw me the rope and I'll follow.

483
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Now, tell the truth. You've never done it. Have you, Stinky?

484
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Of course I've done it, stupid.

485
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Now, come on. Come on. Don't be such a spoiled sport.

486
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
We're all here waiting to cheer you on.

487
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
All right, everybody. I give you the brave, involved Tarzan, Stinky.

488
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Are you watching?

489
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Are you ready, Stinky?

490
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
A big cheer, everyone.

491
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Ready?

492
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Oh, Stinky, my big brave here. Oh, jump!

493
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Well, go on. We're all waiting for you, Stinky.

494
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Come on, Stinky. Show us how it's done.

495
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Come on, Stinky.

496
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Yeah!

497
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Oh, so this is how you've done it lots of times before, is it?

498
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yes, the rope must have shrunk.

499
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
He was trying to fool you. It was a dangerous game.

500
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And he knew very well it couldn't be done.

501
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I didn't.

502
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Now, why don't you come with us and play properly?

503
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
You're gonna be Tarzan as long as you like.

504
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And when you get tired, just let go of the rope. All right, Stinky?

505
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Come on, Stinky.

506
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You can't just leave me.

507
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You're a fox.

508
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And isn't fair, please help. Don't leave me here.

509
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah!

510
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
But Stinky was left on his own to decide whether to climb up the rope or drop into the river.

511
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And the filajong children had more fun than they'd ever had before.

512
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
But they didn't get home until very late in the evening.

513
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Bye, we'll see you tomorrow.

514
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Okay, mommy.

515
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Bye, Momen.

516
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Bye-bye.

517
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Oh, my dear children, I told you to stay at home.

518
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
What earth have you been? Where have you been?

519
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
With movement of the others.

520
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
They kidnapped you, did they?

521
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
No, we've been playing with them.

522
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Well, you can just forget about the movements we're moving out as soon as we possibly can.

523
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Moving, mother?

524
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Yes, right away from this valley.

525
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
This is no place for a spotless and well-ordered home.

526
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
What's the matter?

527
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
No, we don't want to move.

528
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
We want to stay, mother.

529
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Movement house is nice and dusty.

530
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
We want to stay in the movement valley forever.

531
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Oh, please, mother, we love it here.

532
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Oh, after all I've done for you children.

533
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And my experience children usually get what they want.

534
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It was for me.

535
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I was for me.

536
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm for you, I'm for you.

537
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
My dear ones.

538
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm for you.

539
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And that was how Phila Junk and her three children got married.

540
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And that was how Phila Junk and her three children got married.

541
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
John and her three children became permanent residents of

542
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Mumen Valley.

543
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

544
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

545
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
They're always happy and always at play.

546
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

547
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
The movements.

548
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

549
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

550
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
They're always happy and always at play.

551
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

552
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The movements.

553
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
The movements.

554
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Here they are for one and all.

555
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
The movements are about to come.

556
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

557
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
They're here for you on your TV.

558
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
They are the movements.

559
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
They are the movements.

560
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
So come with me, give me your hand.

561
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I'll take you up to Mumenland.

562
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
You can fly just like a bird.

563
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Sing that song ever.

564
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
There were the movements.

565
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
There were the movements.

566
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
There were the movements.

567
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
There were the movements.

568
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
There were the movements.

569
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
There were the movements.

570
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
There were the movements.

571
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
There were the movements.

572
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
There were the movements.

573
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
There were the movements.

574
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
There were the movements.

575
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
There were the movements.

576
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
There were the movements.

577
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
There were the movements.

578
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
There were the movements.

579
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
There were the movements.

580
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:33,000
There were the movements.

581
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
For a whole week, snorkew maiden had been curled up on the sofa, reading fairy tales.

582
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
It's a lovely day.

583
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Last Mumen has persuaded her to come out for a walk in the lonely mountains.

584
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Oh, it's beautiful up here.

585
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Aren't you glad you came now?

586
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
This is much better than fairy tales, isn't it snorkew maiden?

587
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Oh, look, Mumen.

588
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
It's Adelweis.

589
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Adelweis?

590
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
No, it isn't.

591
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
That doesn't grow here at all.

592
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm sure it is.

593
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I know what it looks like.

594
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I'm sorry, but it's not.

595
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Oh, it's just like in Heidi.

596
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
No, it's not.

597
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It's just a Daisy.

598
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Oh, come on.

599
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I want to pick it.

600
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Oh, no, it's too dangerous.

601
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I know then.

602
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You can do it.

603
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You're my boyfriend, aren't you, Mumen?

604
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Well, I suppose we could climb down there, but I promise you it's not Adelweis.

605
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
That only grows in the Alps and there are hundreds of miles away.

606
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I know it's Adelweis.

607
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Be careful.

608
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
They don't care about danger in fairy tales.

609
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:00,000
That's why they call them fairy tales, silly.

610
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Fair Princess, please accept this, my humble offering.

611
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Thank you, Brave Knight.

612
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You were right, Mumen.

613
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
This isn't Adelweis.

614
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
See, I told you.

615
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It's going to be hard to get down from here, you know?

616
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Can't we go back the way we came?

617
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Well, I think it'll be easier to try to get to that path.

618
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
If you say so.

619
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It's nearer anyway.

620
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And better than going up.

621
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I'm surprised you're such a good climber.

622
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Oh, Royalty is good at practically everything.

623
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It's not made of.

624
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It's not made of.

625
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's not made of.

626
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It's not made of.

627
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Let me see six pebbles.

628
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
What was that?

629
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
A giant snowball?

630
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
It can't be.

631
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It isn't winter.

632
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Oh, well, nothing of interest to me.

633
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Now, where was I?

634
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
We start handling.

635
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Has snort maiden just gone past you?

636
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Snort maiden.

637
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
No, all I've seen going past is a very large snowball.

638
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That was snort maiden.

639
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
But she's not made of snow.

640
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Stop!

641
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Snort maiden!

642
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Stop!

643
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Snort maiden.

644
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Snort maiden.

645
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Snort maiden.

646
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Oh, praise the booble.

647
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
She's still breathing.

648
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:09,000
She's just knocked her so out.

649
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Oh, Mum and what's happened to her?

650
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
She's unconscious.

651
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Oh, what are you trying to do?

652
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I want to get her home to Mama.

653
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Oh, difficult.

654
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
She should lose a bit of weight.

655
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Perhaps she'd come around if we splashed cold water in her face.

656
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Oh, there's nothing to fetch it in.

657
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Ah, if you cut some bark off a tree trunk, you could make a small container.

658
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
What a good idea.

659
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
If you stay here, I'll go and do that.

660
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Wake up, snort maiden.

661
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Oh, that's cold.

662
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Has she come around yet, Mr. Himulet?

663
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
No.

664
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Okay.

665
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Oh, good.

666
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
It's working.

667
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
How are you feeling, snort maiden?

668
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Are you alright, snort maiden?

669
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Where am I?

670
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
We're still up in Lonely Mountains.

671
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Who am I?

672
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Why Royal Highness the Princess of Lonely Mountains?

673
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
What?

674
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
A Princess?

675
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Oh, yes.

676
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Of course.

677
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And who are you?

678
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I am the Prince of Lonely Mountains.

679
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Oh, yeah.

680
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Oh, yeah.

681
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
With that ridiculous shape?

682
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Ha.

683
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
No.

684
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
A gesture, perhaps.

685
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
You want?

686
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
You there.

687
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Do not laugh.

688
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I think the poor girl must have lost her memory.

689
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Of course not.

690
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
She's just pretending.

691
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
When does not whisper with royalty present.

692
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Do you hear?

693
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So sorry, Royal Highness.

694
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
A poor crafters cabin.

695
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
This is your castle, ma'am.

696
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Royalty doesn't live in shacks.

697
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Snort maiden.

698
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Stop calling us that.

699
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
It's very rude.

700
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Oh, forgive me.

701
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Our royal castle is elsewhere.

702
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Is it not?

703
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
What?

704
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
That must be hunting lodge.

705
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
No, of course.

706
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
That's what it is.

707
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Good.

708
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
We accept that.

709
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Are you two going to tell me what you're so busy looking at?

710
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Send a maid to my room, my good man.

711
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
A maid.

712
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:17,000
My good man.

713
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Papa, have you seen Snort maiden?

714
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Yes, up there.

715
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Mama, please would you go on have a word with Snort maiden?

716
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Have you been quarreling?

717
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Oh, no.

718
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
It's just that she fell and banged her head,

719
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
and now she thinks she's a royal princess.

720
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
What?

721
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Ah, Nanette, come here, please.

722
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Nanette, I'm Boomin, Mama.

723
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Oh, we're too wary for your foolish jokes, girl.

724
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Oh, we are very tired indeed, Nanette.

725
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Please bring our silk nightie

726
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
with the hand embroidered swans and clowns.

727
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Then you may go.

728
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I wish you, Mama.

729
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
All right, I'm sure.

730
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
But she seems convinced she's a princess.

731
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Sounds as if it's dangerous, doesn't it, Mama?

732
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Oh, I don't think so.

733
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I was only joking when I called her a princess.

734
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I'm very glad you didn't call her an opera singer.

735
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
It's Snort maiden asleep now?

736
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Oh, yes.

737
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
In a night gown with crowns and swans embroidered on it.

738
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And another thing, Boomin, she wants a canopy put up immediately.

739
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
What's that?

740
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Oh, a fancy cover over the bed that's draped in silks,

741
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
silvers and tassels.

742
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Oh.

743
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
She was very upset because there wasn't one there already.

744
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
It might be necessary.

745
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Her memory could have come back by the time she wakes up.

746
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Why don't we wait and see?

747
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
She might be fine after a rest.

748
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I sure hope so.

749
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
But what do we do if it hasn't come back?

750
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Let's think about that if it happens.

751
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
We might not have to build that canopy.

752
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Let me try it.

753
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
John, what?

754
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
To get Snort maiden's memory back, what else?

755
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Oh, how?

756
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Well, I think that if she sees me, she'll remember me

757
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
and then she'll remember everything else, too.

758
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Don't be silly little mind.

759
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
If she doesn't remember me, why should you remember you, eh?

760
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Simple, because I'm unforgettable.

761
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
There is that, I suppose.

762
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
She's still fast asleep.

763
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Well, I'm glad we made the canopy anyway.

764
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It looks really great, doesn't it?

765
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Oh, look, she's opening her eyes.

766
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Are you awake?

767
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Get up, Snort maiden.

768
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Come on.

769
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Let's go down to the beach.

770
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And who is that person?

771
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Come on, you remember me.

772
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I warn you with you, though you'll be sorry.

773
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Oh, quite amusing.

774
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Ah, so you remember me now?

775
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Of course we do.

776
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
There you are, I told you.

777
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Who am I then?

778
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Well, you're another court jester.

779
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Of course.

780
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Don't be little lie.

781
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Court jester.

782
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Oh, very funny.

783
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
She's a better clown than the other one.

784
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
You can perform at our wedding.

785
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
You're a wedding.

786
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Hmm.

787
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, why?

788
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

789
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

790
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

791
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Hi, stinky.

792
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
What are you doing here?

793
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Moments asked me to come over to Moments House

794
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
and propose to some princess.

795
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Moments lost his marbles as well then.

796
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I think he wanted Stinky as a contrast.

797
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
You what?

798
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
You mean to tell me you're both my rivals for the hands of the royal princess?

799
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Well, it's not very original, but in order to win the princess,

800
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
and have her kingdom, Stinky, you'll need to solve three riddles.

801
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Hey, that's great! What's this kingdom like?

802
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
All right, sooner number one, you may now enter.

803
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Oh, that's me.

804
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Oh!

805
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Oh, hi, princess! How are you doing?

806
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Jester, is this man a suitor?

807
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
He is.

808
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I fear he does not treat us with respect.

809
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Forgive him, your highness.

810
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
He is from a foreign land.

811
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And does not know the ways of your kingdom.

812
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Hmm.

813
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Well, all right, very well.

814
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Here is the first riddle. Are you ready?

815
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Are you awake?

816
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Now then, listen, what is it that is yellow?

817
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Has four legs and sings?

818
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Oh, dear. And unusual, canary?

819
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
With four legs, you nincomboop.

820
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I don't know any birds with four legs.

821
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Who said it was a bird?

822
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Oh, I don't know.

823
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I don't know.

824
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I don't know.

825
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I don't know.

826
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I don't know.

827
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I don't know.

828
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I don't know.

829
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Who said it was a bird?

830
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
All right, then. What's the answer, snark baby?

831
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
He shows no respect.

832
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Throw him into a dungeon and give him no food.

833
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
You're highness.

834
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
He is temporarily out of his mind after the long journey here.

835
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Hang on. I'm not out of my mind.

836
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
God, up she is.

837
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
How so what's the answer? That's what I want to know.

838
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Silence. It does not concern you.

839
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
We believe you to be of lowly birth.

840
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Sorry about this, napkin.

841
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Don't worry.

842
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Hmm, no, sir Gellad, but not bad.

843
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I am honored to be here, your royal highness.

844
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
He'll do.

845
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
An easy riddle to start.

846
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Here it is.

847
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
First, what is the number of which we think?

848
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Take your time.

849
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Two?

850
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
For a faux-galat night, that is correct.

851
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Now listen, what is the word upon our mind?

852
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Love.

853
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
That's amazing.

854
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Truly, the suitor has brains as well as looks.

855
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Question three.

856
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
There are two numbers on our mind.

857
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
What do they add up to?

858
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Answer carefully for it.

859
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Could unlock your princess's heart.

860
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Twenty-one.

861
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Oh, was that right, too?

862
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Oh no, it was twenty-two.

863
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
My heart is heavy.

864
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
For chance we should have said it was correct.

865
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
He was rather cute.

866
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Was he not just her?

867
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
It's your turn now, stinky.

868
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Well, I suppose that even half of Snort Toss would be something.

869
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Think she'll ever get her memory back?

870
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Of course she will.

871
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
This is not our idea of a suitor.

872
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
His heart is aching for you, your royal highness.

873
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Ah, let it ache.

874
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Oh, alright.

875
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I'll give him a chance.

876
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Here is a question number one.

877
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
What is the number we are thinking of?

878
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Well, of all our stupid questions.

879
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
We haven't all day.

880
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Oh, well, four.

881
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Indeed not.

882
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It is three million five hundred ninety-eight thousand seven hundred and sixty-five.

883
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Be gone out.

884
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Hey, Snort Toss, that's not fair.

885
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
What fruit is up with his hands?

886
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
It's not fair, right?

887
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It's not fair, right?

888
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Go home.

889
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Give me another one I want after.

890
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Oh, what a rude suitor.

891
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
We are no longer in the mood for royal marriage, Jester.

892
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
At least not today.

893
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
A wise decision.

894
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
A princess of the lonely mountains.

895
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
They will be prostrated with grief,

896
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
but bid the other suitors to go home.

897
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Do not let them beg.

898
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
We would not like that.

899
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Very well, your royal highness.

900
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Do it kindly.

901
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
We wish them no pain at all.

902
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
From this day on, we shall devote ourselves to good works

903
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
and to the well-being of our people.

904
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Oh.

905
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
You know, I didn't want to marry you anyway.

906
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Wonder what Snort Maiden's up to now?

907
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Upstairs thinking.

908
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
She says she'll devote her life to good works.

909
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Work? What works?

910
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I don't know, but she probably wants to be remembered in the history books.

911
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
The princess who was adored by her subjects.

912
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Oh, she's coming down.

913
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Your royal highness.

914
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
May I assist you?

915
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Send the net to us.

916
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
She is on an errand, your highness.

917
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Then have someone else make soup, nourishing but not too rich.

918
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Soup, highness?

919
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Yes indeed.

920
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And then we shall take it to our poor subjects ourselves.

921
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
What kind of soup?

922
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
We don't know.

923
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
We eat.

924
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
We don't cook.

925
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
The poor will be happy with anything brought by the princess herself.

926
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Now hurry, ma'am.

927
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Be quick about it.

928
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
No, she wants some soup.

929
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
This will be ample.

930
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
The poor do not eat much.

931
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
It would only make the meal.

932
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I don't know anyone poor around here, your majesty.

933
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Nonsense.

934
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,000
One, two, one, two, one.

935
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Greetings, jester.

936
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
What now?

937
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
We're taking soup to the poor.

938
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Made with our own regal fingers.

939
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Do you know where they are, jester?

940
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Your fingers?

941
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Oh, I know.

942
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Good, wonderful.

943
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Take us to them now.

944
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
They will be so grateful.

945
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
You back princess.

946
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
That house there.

947
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Oh yes.

948
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
It's nice to know that the poor and my kingdom are so well off.

949
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Oh you, please come over here.

950
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Hmm?

951
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Will you?

952
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I'm the princess of Lonely Mountain.

953
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Princess?

954
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Oh!

955
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
What moment you're all highness?

956
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Do not keep us waiting.

957
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
We have a lot to do.

958
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I'm coming.

959
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I'm coming.

960
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Forgive me you're all highness.

961
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I had no idea you were.

962
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
My, my, smart maiden.

963
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
That common name again.

964
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
We are princess.

965
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Little sticks.

966
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
You're not right in the head.

967
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Coming here bothering your elders and betters like this.

968
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
My betters?

969
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Oh!

970
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Are you the queen then?

971
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Hmm?

972
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I am Mrs. Philly Johnk.

973
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Now what do you want?

974
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
You're just fulfilling our royal duty, bringing soup to the poor.

975
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Giving cheer to those less fortunate that ourselves.

976
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Here my good woman.

977
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Now if you just pour.

978
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Oh there you call me, poor.

979
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
You who doesn't have a stitch of clothing to your name.

980
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Oh!

981
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
The rich aroma of the soup must have overcome you Mrs. Philly Johnk.

982
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Ah!

983
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Eat it yourself your majesty.

984
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Ah!

985
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
This is how I treason.

986
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Send for the guard.

987
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Take her to the tower.

988
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Oh!

989
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Oh!

990
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
We cannot see.

991
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I'm afraid that serves you right, snork maiden.

992
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Snork maiden!

993
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Don't use that common name.

994
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Help us.

995
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
We cannot see.

996
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Please stand still.

997
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Your royal highness.

998
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Oh hold a moment.

999
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Oh!

1000
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Oh!

1001
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Oh!

1002
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I think it's stuck moment.

1003
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Use the handle.

1004
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Ah!

1005
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Stop!

1006
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
You're hurting me.

1007
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Right, I'll get it on.

1008
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Out of the way.

1009
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Ah!

1010
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Wait a minute.

1011
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
You can't break that soup, Turin.

1012
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
It's a family heirloom.

1013
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And you mustn't hit snork maiden on the head.

1014
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
You might hurt her.

1015
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Stop falling around and get this thing off will you?

1016
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
All right.

1017
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Oh!

1018
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Of course, smart maiden.

1019
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
You didn't have to hit her that hard.

1020
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Difficult to judge it with a broom.

1021
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I've never hit anyone wearing a soup, Turin, before.

1022
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
You will write your royal highness.

1023
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Oh, forgive us, your royal highness.

1024
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Sprinkle some cold water over her face.

1025
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
No, she'd hate that, mama.

1026
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Snork maiden.

1027
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Ah, it's no good, woman.

1028
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I don't think she'll wake up to anything but your royal highness.

1029
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Your highness.

1030
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Your highness!

1031
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Your highness!

1032
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Your highness!

1033
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Snork maiden.

1034
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Oh, I'm so glad your royal highness is with us again.

1035
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I hope your royal highness is not badly hurt.

1036
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Oh...

1037
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Where am I?

1038
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
In moment, Valley, of course, stupid.

1039
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Where do you think?

1040
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
That's weird.

1041
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I thought, moment, and I had gone for a walk in the lonely mountains.

1042
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Didn't we, moment?

1043
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Huh?

1044
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Do you remember who I am, Snork maiden?

1045
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Moment.

1046
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
What are you talking about, of course I do.

1047
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And you don't think you're a princess anymore?

1048
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Princess?

1049
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Have you gone crazy or something?

1050
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
What princess?

1051
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
What do you mean, moment?

1052
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Hooray!

1053
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
She's back to normal.

1054
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Snork maiden's back to normal.

1055
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Yes, it's nice to have you back again.

1056
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Yes, it's wonderful.

1057
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Welcome home.

1058
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
What is?

1059
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
What's wonderful?

1060
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Have you all gone loopy or something?

1061
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Never mind, Snork maiden.

1062
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Ha ha, you bumped your head, that's all.

1063
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
And so Snork maiden's brief spell as a royal princess came to an end.

1064
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Except that she was the only one who didn't remember it.

1065
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
But everyone else in moment Valley breathed a sigh of relief.

1066
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:03,000
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the romance.

1067
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1068
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
They're always happy and always at play.

1069
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

1070
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
The movements.

1071
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
The movements.

1072
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:32,000
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

1073
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1074
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,000
They're always happy and always at play.

1075
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

1076
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
The movements.

1077
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
The movements.

1078
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:01,000
The movements.

1079
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Here they are for one and all.

1080
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
The movements are about to come.

1081
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

1082
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
They're for you on your TV.

1083
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
They are the movements.

1084
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
They are the movements.

1085
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
So come with me, give me your hand.

1086
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I'll take you up to a moment land.

1087
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
You can fly just like a bird.

1088
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Sing that song ever.

1089
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
There were the movements.

1090
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
There were the movements.

1091
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
There were the movements.

1092
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
There was the movements.

1093
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
There was the movements.

1094
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
There was the movements.

1095
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

1096
01:07:37,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da dat da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

1097
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,000
However, we do know that they don't look like this because this is Sniff, one of Moonman's friends.

1098
01:08:37,000 --> 01:09:01,000
So it looks as though the rumor was right.

1099
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Oh, what rumor was that?

1100
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
That we were about to be invaded by aliens from outer space.

1101
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Oh, dear, do you mean that thing that was chasing me might have been one of them?

1102
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Well, yes.

1103
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I thought they were just after me.

1104
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I wouldn't have thought you'd have been that important to them Sniff, but I suppose you never know, do you?

1105
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:32,000
It says here in this book that aliens from outer space are very civilized and peace-loving and would never want to invade us.

1106
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
It seemed as though they're quite happy where they are.

1107
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I do, it's not a very scientific book.

1108
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Well, it was definitely attacking me, Mom and Papa, I know it was.

1109
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Well, it might have been a civilization from another planet, Sniff.

1110
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
They were just hungry.

1111
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Well, the inspector told me that he thought we were being invaded by aliens, and he shouldn't know.

1112
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I'm sure he's exaggerating.

1113
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I wonder what they look like.

1114
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Why don't you come and help me in the garden?

1115
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
You never know, we might see one.

1116
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Mama, wait for me!

1117
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Mama, what's that?

1118
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Well, I would say it's not a vegetable, that's for sure.

1119
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
It looks like a flying saucer.

1120
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I wonder if there are any aliens in it.

1121
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
They might be heard, Mama.

1122
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Let's have a look.

1123
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I think there's something there.

1124
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
This looks odd.

1125
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I wonder what it is.

1126
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
It's a bit like a radio, isn't it?

1127
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Oh yeah, an alien radio.

1128
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Do you think there's anyone in there moving?

1129
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Anybody there?

1130
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
It seems to have been deserted.

1131
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
There's a funny noise coming from it.

1132
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Well, it doesn't look to me like it could fly again.

1133
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
It could be repaired.

1134
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
You'd need to know about flying saucers.

1135
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Papa could do it?

1136
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I don't think flying saucers should make that sort of noise.

1137
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Do you, woman?

1138
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I don't think so, but I don't know very much about them.

1139
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It does seem a bit odd as if they've said it to be blown up

1140
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
so that no one would be able to steal it

1141
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
because they want to keep the design a secret.

1142
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Do you think it will?

1143
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Oh!

1144
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I'm not sure, Mama, but let's get away in case it does explode.

1145
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
That's why it's empty, but I wish it hadn't landed in the Asparagus patch.

1146
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I'll take the radio with me.

1147
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
It won't be too long now, Mama.

1148
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
No, it won't.

1149
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
It won't be long, then.

1150
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
It's vanished.

1151
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Bless my soul.

1152
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Papa's book said they could be a very advanced life form.

1153
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
There's nothing to show it was ever here,

1154
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
except the hole in the ground, and this radio thing.

1155
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Hmm.

1156
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Is it a radio, Papa?

1157
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I don't know. It looks a bit like one.

1158
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Let's try pressing one of these buttons.

1159
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
The red one first, I think.

1160
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Oh!

1161
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Papa, where have you gone?

1162
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Well, I'm right here, Boomin.

1163
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I wonder what happens if I press this one.

1164
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't see you either, dear.

1165
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
What?

1166
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Oh, I see.

1167
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
So if you press the red button, you'll become invisible.

1168
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
What a fascinating machine.

1169
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Papa, I think I'd rather see you, dear.

1170
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Well, of course you would.

1171
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Well, then let's try the yellow one.

1172
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I think. Can you see me now?

1173
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
No, Papa.

1174
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Oh, that's odd.

1175
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Do you want me to try, Papa?

1176
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Please, Mama.

1177
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
There, that's it.

1178
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Oh, Papa.

1179
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Oh, that's a very dangerous machine.

1180
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I don't want to disappear ever again.

1181
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
It's not a nice experience.

1182
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
No, dear. I didn't like you vanishing like that.

1183
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
We must put it somewhere safe, Mama, where the children can't find it.

1184
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Yes, dear.

1185
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
What?

1186
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Moment!

1187
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Snork maiden, what an earth's the matter.

1188
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
We found a strange creature.

1189
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Strange creature?

1190
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I think it's an alien.

1191
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Does it look like a jellyfish?

1192
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
No, not at all.

1193
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Little mice keeping an eye on it. Come on!

1194
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Where are you going, Moment, Papa?

1195
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,800
Going me, I don't know, Especial.

1196
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,240
Moving mama, hang on.

1197
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,680
I've got a few questions for you.

1198
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,920
Really, Inspector?

1199
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,840
I was told that a flying saucer

1200
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,520
had landed in your garden, but all I can see is a big hole.

1201
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,520
Where is it?

1202
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,280
What have you done with the saucer?

1203
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,400
Nothing.

1204
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,560
Well, where is it?

1205
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,440
It's not there now.

1206
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,360
It was there, but then it just vanished.

1207
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,600
Vanished?

1208
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,560
Yes, that's right.

1209
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,920
When you say vanish, do you mean it flew away again?

1210
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,800
No, it just went, woof, gone.

1211
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,800
Moments are it, too.

1212
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,840
That's very odd.

1213
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,200
Yes, it was.

1214
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:19,520
Did you see any aliens on board by any chance?

1215
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,760
No.

1216
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,640
Are you telling me the truth?

1217
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,680
Of course.

1218
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,440
Why should I lie to you?

1219
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,040
Well, I can't.

1220
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,240
Think of any reason.

1221
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,720
I'm sorry, but it's upsetting aliens

1222
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,520
invading Moment Valley.

1223
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:33,600
Yes, it is.

1224
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,880
Can we go now?

1225
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,400
Certainly.

1226
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,920
Where are you all going, by the way?

1227
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,880
Oh, only to the beach to collect shells.

1228
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,480
See you, Inspector.

1229
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:49,240
Collecting shells, indeed, while I'm hunting for aliens.

1230
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,640
Ah, over here!

1231
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,840
Ah, ah!

1232
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,080
Ah, ah!

1233
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,280
Ah, ah!

1234
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,320
Do you know what I'm doing?

1235
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,760
Ah, ah, ah!

1236
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,240
Is that an alien?

1237
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,000
It certainly is, but not like it says in the book.

1238
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,440
Have you tried talking to it?

1239
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,280
Yes, but it wouldn't answer.

1240
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,800
Well, let me try.

1241
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,920
Are you from outer space?

1242
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:18,720
Go show what, Lee.

1243
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,760
What, Lee, do I see Duckidackadale in Dublin?

1244
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,080
Yes, Lee, do I see Duckidackadale?

1245
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,920
I've never been.

1246
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,720
It looks like an alien child to me.

1247
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,000
More like a lamp.

1248
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:29,880
Poor thing.

1249
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,240
He must be hungry.

1250
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,840
Let's take him home.

1251
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:36,080
Yeah, well, we don't want the inspector to see him.

1252
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:50,520
That is nothing.

1253
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,840
It's not under a bottle of love.

1254
01:16:51,840 --> 01:17:01,640
I'm sorry we can't understand you, but I'm sure you'll like milk, even if you don't

1255
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:02,640
speak English.

1256
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,840
Just try it and see.

1257
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,680
I think he's missing his home.

1258
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:12,200
Wherever in the universe that might be.

1259
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,120
I wonder where his parents are.

1260
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,560
He can't have come on his own.

1261
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,240
He seems far too little for that.

1262
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,280
Well, I don't know.

1263
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,080
But he's obviously missing him, and he seems very unhappy.

1264
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,520
Do you think the inspector would really arrest him, Owen Papa?

1265
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,520
Possibly.

1266
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,720
He would think it is duty.

1267
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,200
Well, that would be horrible of him.

1268
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,200
I know.

1269
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,600
Don't touch me.

1270
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,720
Don't touch me.

1271
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,840
Oh, it's inspector.

1272
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,440
Oh, dear.

1273
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:44,320
He mustn't find him here.

1274
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,000
And he's got stinky with him.

1275
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
No, stinky.

1276
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,320
Well, that means trouble.

1277
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,320
Quick.

1278
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,320
He can hide in the kitchen.

1279
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,320
We got to do something.

1280
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,320
And quickly.

1281
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,320
I know what to do.

1282
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,320
What, Mama?

1283
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,320
We'll use the machine.

1284
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,320
Oh, yeah.

1285
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:18,720
We'll just keep him out of sight.

1286
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:24,960
Now, then, this one, right?

1287
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:29,960
Oh, dear.

1288
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,960
I think they're here.

1289
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,480
Oh, moving Papa.

1290
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:39,280
I heard there was an alien here with what?

1291
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:45,280
What's happening?

1292
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,280
What's happened to me?

1293
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,280
Goodness, inspector.

1294
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,280
You're very shiny.

1295
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,280
Oh, dear.

1296
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,280
Yes.

1297
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,280
How very, very strange.

1298
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:54,520
You look like a great big glow worm.

1299
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,480
An inspector in shining armor, you mean, little my?

1300
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,720
That's just what I thought.

1301
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:03,560
You will never need a lamp to be seen, inspector.

1302
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,560
I like it.

1303
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,320
Criminals will be afraid of me.

1304
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,760
I can't wait to get back to the station and show the constables.

1305
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,360
Handy for reading in bed, too.

1306
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,360
Well, duty calls.

1307
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,360
Bye.

1308
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,520
What are you doing?

1309
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,720
I didn't know that the machine was still working.

1310
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,720
Oh, you can speak English.

1311
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,720
Of course I can.

1312
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,320
It's just that I need my language converted to help me to translate.

1313
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,600
And if you hadn't taken it from my ship and hidden it,

1314
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,760
I would have been able to talk sooner.

1315
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,440
That's a good way to learn, isn't it?

1316
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,440
Where are you going?

1317
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,520
To see that nice shiny man.

1318
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,400
But he'll arrest you.

1319
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,400
He came here looking for you, but he forgot about it

1320
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:53,840
when the machine started him glowing.

1321
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,000
No, don't go there.

1322
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,200
Hey, wait.

1323
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,960
I love that lint of shimmer.

1324
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:04,000
It's just like, oh, it makes me feel really safe.

1325
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,840
Hello, hello, inspector.

1326
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,400
Yes, what is it?

1327
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,840
Take me with you.

1328
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,440
What?

1329
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:13,840
Oh, you're so bright and beautiful inspector.

1330
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,600
Oh, you think so?

1331
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,600
Hello, everyone, shimmers like that.

1332
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,280
Everyone.

1333
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,760
Well, that must be very nice for them.

1334
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,760
I want to pose you, please.

1335
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,800
I'm sorry, I'm too busy, but it was nice talking to you.

1336
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,600
You see, the aliens have invaded Movement Valley,

1337
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,200
and I must find them.

1338
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,200
Oh, I just remembered.

1339
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:39,200
I was tipped off that there was one of them in Moomin House.

1340
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,200
Oh.

1341
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,960
The inspector's coming back.

1342
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,120
What about the alien?

1343
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,680
He's running after him.

1344
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,640
Has he been handcuffed, Moomin?

1345
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,720
I don't think so.

1346
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,680
Open up in the name of the law, Moomin Papa.

1347
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,560
Certainly for you, inspector.

1348
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:06,400
Come on in.

1349
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,840
You're very welcome.

1350
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:12,040
Moomin Papa, I have information from a reliable source

1351
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:15,720
while sort of reliable that you have been harping

1352
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,800
a fugitive.

1353
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,640
I'm sorry.

1354
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,600
In other words, I believe you have been hiding an alien here.

1355
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,840
Oh, inspector, I don't think hiding is the right word.

1356
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,360
That suggests we are trying to keep something from you.

1357
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,760
Well, Moomin?

1358
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,480
Would we do that, inspector?

1359
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:37,920
That stinky is tricked me again.

1360
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,800
Isn't it lucky he didn't find you?

1361
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,040
I want a nice inspector.

1362
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,120
Look, how many times must I tell you?

1363
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,040
He'll lock you up in an nasty cell.

1364
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:46,880
I like him.

1365
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,520
I want to see him.

1366
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,520
No, don't.

1367
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,600
Perhaps if we press the yellow button, he'll stop shining.

1368
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:57,600
Good idea, Papa.

1369
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,600
Be quick, Mama.

1370
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,600
The yellow button.

1371
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,600
Here goes.

1372
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,600
You don't want him now that he stopped shining.

1373
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,600
Do you, little fella?

1374
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,600
Let's go home, man.

1375
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,600
Moomin, Mama, come and look.

1376
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,600
We've saved the alien.

1377
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,600
Moomin, Mama, the inspector's not glowing anymore.

1378
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,600
Isn't that something?

1379
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:36,600
Mama.

1380
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:42,600
Mama.

1381
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,600
Where are you, man?

1382
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,600
I'm here.

1383
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:47,600
Hey, what?

1384
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,600
Where are you, Mama?

1385
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,600
Well, Mama.

1386
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:55,600
Right here.

1387
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,600
Mama.

1388
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,600
Oh, no.

1389
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,600
What's happened to you?

1390
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,600
I don't know.

1391
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,600
Probably that machine again.

1392
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,600
Oh, so it shrinks you as well as making you invisible, does it?

1393
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:09,600
Well, well.

1394
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,600
Oh, dear.

1395
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:12,600
I need an apron.

1396
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,600
Papa, can you get a handkerchief from my handbag?

1397
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,600
You really are quite small.

1398
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,600
That you look very cute, of course, Mama.

1399
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,600
Would you like to stay like that for a while?

1400
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,600
No, but I would not.

1401
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:29,600
Push another button quickly before anyone sees me.

1402
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,600
Go on now.

1403
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:31,600
Hurry up, Papa.

1404
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,600
Yeah.

1405
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,600
Oh, dear.

1406
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,600
What's up?

1407
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,600
The machine's gone.

1408
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,600
Hey, you!

1409
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,600
Taking it back!

1410
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,600
Papa.

1411
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,600
Don't worry, Mama.

1412
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,600
I'll get it back.

1413
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,600
Look, not that way.

1414
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,600
Stop him, Moments.

1415
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,600
Stop him.

1416
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,600
He stole the machine.

1417
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,600
We'll get him, Papa.

1418
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,600
Hey, Sniff.

1419
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,600
Sniff.

1420
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,600
Don't let Steve keep getting away.

1421
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,600
Right.

1422
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,600
Inventory!

1423
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,600
Please let me pass, Sniff.

1424
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,600
I'll give you a gold stopper.

1425
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,600
A gold stopper?

1426
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:27,600
I mean, free.

1427
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:28,600
No, no, five.

1428
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,600
Five?

1429
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,600
No.

1430
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,600
Give me the machine, Stinky.

1431
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,600
Where is it, Moments?

1432
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,600
What's happened to the machine?

1433
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,600
It's at the bottom of the river, Papa.

1434
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,600
Oh, poor Mama. Poor Mama.

1435
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,600
What's wrong with her?

1436
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,600
Well, she needs the machine to get back to normal.

1437
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,600
Normal?

1438
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,600
Well, at least this is a chance to do some really fine embroidery.

1439
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,600
Don't worry, Mama.

1440
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,600
I promise we'll look after you.

1441
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,600
It's all right, Moomin.

1442
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,600
I'll manage.

1443
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,600
I'll have to get some smaller pots and pans, though,

1444
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,600
and we'll have to have smaller helpings.

1445
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,600
But that might be a bad idea.

1446
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,600
Oh.

1447
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:43,600
Here.

1448
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,600
Here.

1449
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,600
Mama, Papa.

1450
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,600
It's like the one we saw in the garden.

1451
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,600
Mama, Papa.

1452
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,600
Oh, my God.

1453
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,600
This is a very bad idea.

1454
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,600
Hey, I'm sorry, Mama.

1455
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:42,600
I'm sorry, Mama.

1456
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,600
I'm sorry, Mama.

1457
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,600
Mama, Papa.

1458
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,600
I'm sorry, Mama.

1459
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,600
I'm sorry, Mama.

1460
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,600
We'll go grow up like broccoli grew.

1461
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,600
My parents, we still thank you for looking after me.

1462
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,600
But, I faced with a very very...

1463
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,600
They're telling you all, aren't they?

1464
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,600
Yes, because I took a flying saucer.

1465
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:11,600
Look, would you ask your parents to make mama a normal size again?

1466
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,600
Yes, of course.

1467
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,600
Fiddler grassly grassly girl.

1468
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,600
Don't bring him.

1469
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,600
Oh, that's more like it.

1470
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1471
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:34,320
Oh, oh, oh, dear, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no, stop, it's too much!

1472
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry, but could you try again please?

1473
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:42,360
I know, the more a mama there is, the better what you're getting very large, very large indeed.

1474
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:46,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1475
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:06,240
So movement valley hadn't really been invaded at all and the movements and the

1476
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:11,000
friends that found out were aliens really looked like

1477
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:35,800
happy and always at play the movements are having fun day after day the

1478

1479
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:57,240

1481
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:17,160

1484

1485
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:18,880
with the movements there were the movements there were the movements there were the movements

1486
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:58,880
there were the movements there were the movements there were the movements there were the movements

1487
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:36,400
movement valley is enjoying another still peaceful summer's day however this lazy lifestyle no

1488
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:47,440
matter how pleasant it might be does not suit everyone oh yes would you like a cup of coffee

1489
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:57,840
dear yes I think I need one mama oh dear is it your memoirs I'm stuck ah can I help how can I

1490
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:05,600
create in this in what in this sleepy atmosphere I've also come to a boring part when was that the time

1491
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:17,200
I wrote poems were they any good no well miss that bit out then I can't I must put it down for

1492
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:24,640
posterity it is my duty but how can I get inspiration here in this place when nothing ever happens

1493
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:32,800
nothing ever happens at all oh I think this means another adventure yes mama that I need it to be

1494
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:42,640
big exciting and frightening mama what's the matter are you all right your father says that

1495
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:48,320
because nothing ever happens here he can't write so I'm looking for an adventure for him can you

1496
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:54,240
think of anything he wants it to be big exciting and frightening does he want something really exciting

1497
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:59,680
yes dear I'm afraid so I think I could manage that

1498
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,080
that looks like the footprint of a huge monster

1499
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:25,280
oh it's a good feeling giving others a bit of excitement

1500
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:42,880
hey hey hey hey hey hey just a couple more yeah hey I'm praise the booboo I don't have to

1501
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:47,360
the modest work very often yeah that was harder than I thought

1502
01:33:50,160 --> 01:34:01,840
oh sleepy hands wake up everybody moment papa quickly get up moment mama a monster you've been

1503
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:11,920
visited by a monster wake up before you eat in a line come on hurry hurry my what huge tracks

1504
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,760
that's to keep them guessing for a while

1505
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,240
hmm it could be a monster from the depths of the ocean

1506
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:27,360
something's not right here don't you think it's a bit odd that it came directly to move

1507
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:30,720
well look at the footsteps they go in a straight line

1508
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,720
someone must have told it to go to a moment house

1509
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:42,560
and they're only going one way look there are tiny footsteps going back to the sea

1510
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:48,000
oh now that the monster must still be here then oh well not necessarily

1511
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:54,000
retracing one's own footsteps is the sign of an advanced intelligence stepping back exactly

1512
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:00,160
the way you came the tough question is why would the monster do that one is led to believe that

1513
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:06,320
it wants us to think it's still here when in fact it has gone back to wherever it came from

1514
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:13,280
fiddle battle is my dear mother would say but why would it want us to think that papa it's a spy

1515
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:19,360
oh it's a spy something it shouldn't it is hardly be a good spy if we knew they have to sneak in

1516
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:29,440
and out I think it's still here I can feel it you know what I mean perhaps tonight tonight what

1517
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:34,560
about tonight that's when they'll attack it's gone back to give its report how do you know that

1518
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:42,800
papa well obviously that's why it still wants us to believe it's here yes what is it moving

1519
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:48,560
something terrible is going to happen a monster is going to attack us tonight and papa's excited

1520
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:58,160
about it oh good that's nice for him hurry everyone I expect the monster will be here soon

1521
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:11,440
now hold it still this is going to be a good barricade don't you think

1522
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:18,800
we'd better make sure it's big enough it's hardly any fun the tall playing tricks on them they're so

1523
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:28,880
gullible if we catch the monster we can sell it to a zoo I'll handle the sale of course I'd rather

1524
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:34,080
tame it and keep it as a pet well you could ride on it to go pigni-king

1525
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:55,520
right now for the moat here we go hope the wells got enough water in it

1526
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:03,680
it'll be able to swim in this papa yes it'll remind you to the sea and keep it calm

1527
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:12,080
this is fresh water papa we'd better put some salt in it good idea moment we'll plant some seaweed

1528
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:22,560
and put some rocks in too and then it'll feel really at home I wonder when it'll come

1529
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:29,360
I don't know but I can feel in my bones it'll be tonight and we keep watch until it comes

1530
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:35,040
of course we will constantly what if it doesn't come until tomorrow night or the night after that

1531
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:41,120
it might be a long wait so we'll take it in turns and remember everybody the safety of

1532
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:45,040
Moomin Valley relies upon our vigilance we must be ready

1533
01:37:45,040 --> 01:38:09,120
huh look at what those fools have done it was worth all the trouble

1545
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:52,320

what

1590
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:29,560
What was that?

1591
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:40,560
Mum and Papa, wake up!

1592
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,560
Mum and Papa?

1593
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:59,560
Oh!

1594
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,560
It tastes brackish!

1595
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:13,560
We must be quite near the sea.

1596
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:30,560
That's a big one.

1597
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:45,560
Gotcha!

1598
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:51,560
Momen, momen, where are you so far from home?

1599
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,560
Mum, at last!

1600
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,560
Look, I've got a big fish!

1601
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:58,560
Come and help me quickly!

1602
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:00,560
Don't let it get away!

1603
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:12,560
I've never seen such a big fish movement!

1604
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,560
Just wait till Papa sees it!

1605
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:15,560
Oh, yes.

1606
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:18,560
Mumen, Papa, this looks familiar.

1607
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,560
It's Mumen Valley, isn't it?

1608
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:22,560
Of course it is, just outside the cave!

1609
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:23,560
Oh dear.

1610
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:26,560
I'm afraid that your father will be a bit disappointed.

1611
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:28,560
Where is he then?

1612
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,560
Well...

1613
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,560
He's gone, looking for adventure.

1614
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:35,560
Adventure? Where?

1615
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:37,560
I don't really know.

1616
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:38,560
Somewhere.

1617
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,560
I could have gone with him.

1618
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:42,560
When's he coming home?

1619
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:45,560
I'm afraid I don't know that either.

1620
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:48,560
You know Papa, tonight, tomorrow night.

1621
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:50,560
Next Christmas?

1622
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,560
Your guess is as good as mine, Mumen.

1623
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:56,560
Wow! I bet he's having a great adventure right now!

1624
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,560
Hey, Mumma?

1625
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:12,560
Mumma?

1626
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:16,560
Hello, where are you?

1627
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:20,560
Oh, the cave dwellers must have her.

1628
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:22,560
Oh, Mumma.

1629
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,560
Mumma!

1630
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,560
Mumma!

1631
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,560
Can you hear me?

1632
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,560
Oh!

1633
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,560
Goodness, the sea.

1634
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,560
Oh, this looks like...

1635
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:00,560
Oh, it gets... oh, dear.

1636
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,560
Terry, me, I don't...

1637
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,560
Oh, well...

1638
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:12,560
Oh, my!

1639
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,560
Oh, you see?

1640
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:16,560
It might be the...

1641
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,560
Yes, it is.

1642
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:20,560
Oh, yeah, of course.

1643
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,560
Hellio, me.

1644
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,560
Oh, look! Look, it's Papa!

1645
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:34,560
Papa's back, everyone!

1646
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,560
Uh-huh.

1647
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:38,560
Hey, Papa!

1648
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:42,560
Ah, well...

1649
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,560
I'm back.

1650
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,560
I'm so pleased to see you again.

1651
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:48,560
Thank you, Mumma.

1652
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:50,560
Papa, how was your adventure?

1653
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,560
Uh, unexpected.

1654
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:54,560
Yes, that's what I'd say.

1655
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:56,560
Unexpected. Any food.

1656
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:58,560
Oh, yes. You can try mine first, Mumen, Papa.

1657
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,560
Oh, mine's the best. Try mine, Papa.

1658
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:02,560
Oh, that's good. I'm starving.

1659
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,560
Tell us about your adventure.

1660
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:06,560
I love you.

1661
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,560
I love you.

1662
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,560
Were you an immortal danger? Did you eat any rats?

1663
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,560
Yeah, I am.

1664
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,560
Suppose there's adventure.

1665
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:16,560
I don't think Papa wants to talk about his adventure yet.

1666
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,560
Maybe later.

1667
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:22,560
And that was the end of Mumma and Papa's adventure.

1668
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:26,560
They didn't get far, but then you don't have to sometimes for things to happen.

1669
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,560
Or at least for you to think they're happening.

1670
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:38,560
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

1671
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:46,560
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1672
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:50,560
They're always happy and always at play.

1673
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:54,560
The movements are having fun day after day.

1674
01:51:54,560 --> 01:52:02,560
The movements.

1675
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:08,560
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

1676
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:16,560
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1677
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:20,560
They're always happy and always at play.

1678
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:24,560
The movements are having fun day after day.

1679
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,560
The movements.

1680
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:30,560
The movements.

1681
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:36,560
The movements.

1682
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:56,560
The movements.

1683
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:00,560
Here they are for one and all.

1684
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:04,560
The movements are about to come.

1685
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:08,560
Come on and sit down here with me.

1686
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,560
Therefore you want your TV.

1687
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:14,560
They are the movements.

1688
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:16,560
So come with me.

1689
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:18,560
Give me your hand.

1690
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:22,560
You can fly just like a bird.

1691
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:24,560
Sing the best song ever.

1692
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:28,560
There were the movements.

1693
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:32,560
There were the movements.

1694
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:36,560
There were the movements.

1695
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:42,560
There were the movements.

1696
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:52,560
There were the movements.

1697
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:56,560
There were the movements.

1698
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:00,560
There were the movements.

1699
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:06,560
There were the movements.

1700
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:16,560
There were the movements.

1701
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:32,560
It was the end of summer, but still every day seemed harder than the last.

1702
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:38,560
The movement valley had no rain for weeks, and finally the river had dried up.

1703
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:42,560
Papa says this weather is a catastrophe snuffing.

1704
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,560
But it is.

1705
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:50,560
He says the movement valley will turn into a desert if it carries on.

1706
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:54,560
Papa can't ever remember it so hot, even the river has dried up.

1707
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,560
No, that does worry me.

1708
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,560
I can't fish anymore.

1709
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:04,560
The travels I found that droughts like this are always followed by a real heavy downpour.

1710
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:10,560
Well, it's too hot for me anyway.

1711
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:24,560
Oh, it's so hot I can't think.

1712
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:32,560
I can, I can always think of something.

1713
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:40,560
Well, well, even the weeds are wilting.

1714
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:52,560
The sea never dries up, does it?

1715
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:56,560
Of course not stupid wherever the fish go.

1716
01:55:56,560 --> 01:56:00,560
I'm going swimming.

1717
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:30,560
Here you are.

1718
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:34,560
Watch this.

1719
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:44,560
Look at that.

1720
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:14,560
Ah!

1721
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:24,560
Ah!

1722
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:36,560
Ah!

1723
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,560
Ouch, that hurt.

1724
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,560
What's this stupid box doing here?

1725
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,560
I think it's floated from foreign lands.

1726
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,560
What's it got in it?

1727
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:46,560
Perhaps it's full of priceless jewels.

1728
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:50,560
No, it wouldn't float so high in the water if it was.

1729
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:52,560
A tiara packed in wood shavings.

1730
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:56,560
I could use a new comb too.

1731
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,560
What have you found you too?

1732
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:00,560
It's a treasure.

1733
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:02,560
No, we don't think so.

1734
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:04,560
It's not heavy enough.

1735
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:06,560
But you never know, Snork Maiden.

1736
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:08,560
Let's open it and see.

1737
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:12,560
Come on, Slays, push me a shore.

1738
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:14,560
Perhaps it's gold nuggets in here.

1739
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:18,560
Our diamonds are something to eat.

1740
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:28,560
Ah!

1741
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,560
What is this?

1742
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:32,560
Seeds maybe.

1743
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:36,560
What sort of seeds?

1744
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:38,560
Hmm.

1745
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:42,560
Well, at first glance I'd say they might be tropical plants.

1746
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:44,560
Oh, really?

1747
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:46,560
What plants are tropical?

1748
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,560
It's like banana or mango.

1749
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:50,560
Banana and mango.

1750
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:54,560
Well, I haven't done a lot of research on tropical plants so I can't be sure,

1751
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:56,560
but they do look like it.

1752
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:58,560
I know, Mama. Why don't we plant them?

1753
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,560
Good idea, woman.

1754
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:04,560
The thing is, we don't have a tropical climate.

1755
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:06,560
I'm afraid they wouldn't grow here at all.

1756
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:08,560
Let's plant them, shall we?

1757
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,560
They won't bear any fruit, so don't get too excited.

1758
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:14,560
Oh, well, it seems tropical enough to me, Mr. Hanuman.

1759
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:16,560
At least we can try, can't we?

1760
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:19,560
I want to see what papaya looks like and ugly fruit.

1761
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:22,560
I want mangoes growing all around my bedroom window.

1762
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:26,560
Let's plant them, shall we?

1763
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:32,560
I tell you they're strictly tropical. They won't take root at all.

1764
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:48,560
It certainly seems that Mama is enjoying herself, Mr. Hanuman.

1765
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:50,560
I don't think it'll be much use.

1766
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:54,560
Well, perhaps not, but it's still worth the farm in trying.

1767
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:58,560
Imagine, woman valley, a tropical jungle.

1768
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:04,560
Oh, Mr. Hanuman, do you think these seeds will grow into real fruit trees?

1769
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,560
Hmm.

1770
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:13,560
Oh, Mr. Hanuman, do you think these seeds will grow into real fruit trees?

1771
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:15,560
Hmm, let me see.

1772
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:17,560
What have you got here, little my?

1773
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:23,560
I could very well be mistaken, but I think this one is a mango seed.

1774
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:25,560
Hmm, thanks.

1775
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:28,560
And why do you want to know, little my?

1776
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:30,560
Because I'm only growing fruit.

1777
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:35,560
I want to be sure I'm not planting stupid orchids or passion flowers or something.

1778
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:38,560
Ha, ha, ha.

1779
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:43,560
Mr. Hemuman, can you tell me which one of these is banana?

1780
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:46,560
Yeah, I'm not really too sure, but I think it's this one.

1781
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:49,560
Do you want to grow an orchid too, snorkemaiden?

1782
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:52,560
No, I just want to plant a banana tree in a really special place.

1783
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:56,560
It's Mouin's favorite fruit.

1784
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:03,560
I think she'll be disappointed bananas won't grow here.

1785
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:06,560
Hmm, this weather doesn't belong here either.

1786
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,560
If it gets any harder, I'll melt.

1787
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:10,560
I can't wait for dusk, so it'll cool down a bit.

1788
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,560
Hmm.

1789
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:25,560
Isn't it wonderful to go to sleep looking at the stars?

1790
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:27,560
And it's not so hot anymore.

1791
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:30,560
I'll sleep like a log tonight.

1792
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:33,560
Oh, you always do, don't you, little my?

1793
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:36,560
Well, I'll sleep like an extra heavy log, then.

1794
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:46,560
Snorkemaiden, why don't you sleep under that tree with Mouin and little my?

1795
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:51,560
Oh, because I can't see the stars from there, and it makes me feel romantic looking at them.

1796
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:55,560
But you're going to get very wet if it starts raining in the night.

1797
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:57,560
You're joking, surely, Mama.

1798
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:59,560
Not at all.

1799
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:03,560
But it hasn't rained for ages, and there aren't any clouds or anything.

1800
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:05,560
Just stars.

1801
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:08,560
All the toothpicks fell on the floor, and that's a sure sign of rain.

1802
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:11,560
Snorkemaiden won't mind if she gets all wet, Lumen Mama.

1803
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:14,560
That should be happy.

1804
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:16,560
Who? Why is that?

1805
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:22,560
Because then she'll know that the special tree will start growing, and that's very important to her.

1806
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:24,560
That's true.

1807
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:28,560
Good night, everyone. I hope you sleep well.

1808
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:32,560
Good night, everybody.

1809
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:48,560
Good night, Lumen.

1810
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:50,560
Good night. Don't snore.

1811
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:53,560
Good night.

1812
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:09,560
It's too hot to sleep.

1813
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:12,560
Why don't you sleep outside like the children?

1814
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:14,560
I think I will.

1815
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:25,560
A thunderstorm.

1816
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:29,560
I told you the toothpicks are never wrong.

1817
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:41,560
Oh! Hey, it's raining, Lumen!

1818
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:44,560
Wake up, Lumen!

1819
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:46,560
Oh, is it morning?

1820
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,560
The sun's really bright.

1821
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:50,560
No, it's raining.

1822
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:52,560
Rainy?

1823
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:54,560
Look at that.

1824
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:57,560
You look, I'm getting wet. I'm going inside.

1825
02:03:57,560 --> 02:03:59,560
So Mama was right about the rain.

1826
02:03:59,560 --> 02:04:02,560
Hey, Snorkemaiden!

1827
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:04,560
Doesn't she look sweet?

1828
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:06,560
Snorkemaiden!

1829
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:08,560
Is it raining? That's very clever.

1830
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:11,560
Your mother knows everything doesn't she?

1831
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:12,560
She does.

1832
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:13,560
Now let's get into the house.

1833
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:16,560
Not yet. I want to feel the rain on my face.

1834
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:19,560
It's been so long.

1835
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:25,560
Ha! Do you want to feel it much longer?

1836
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:21,560
Oh, it's stopped raining.

1837
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:32,560
Mangoes! That's impossible!

1838
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:34,560
Gosh!

1839
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:41,560
By my tail, a jungle! That's a tropical jungle!

1840
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:51,560
Wake up! Wake up, you two!

1841
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:55,560
There's a jungle outside. We've planted a jungle!

1842
02:05:57,560 --> 02:06:00,560
A jungle?

1843
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:07,560
You're right, Moments. Those seeds have not only sprouted.

1844
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,560
I know. They're big trees.

1845
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:11,560
I've never known trees to grow like that.

1846
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:13,560
That's... that's...

1847
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:16,560
I think I'll go and play Tarzan.

1848
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:20,560
I wish my lettuce seeds would do that and move in, Papa.

1849
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:24,560
There's magic here somewhere, Mama. Let's go and explore.

1850
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:30,560
That's rain drumming on the campus.

1851
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:38,560
It must be...

1852
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:41,560
Snorkemaiden!

1853
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:45,560
What a nurse all this!

1854
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:49,560
Well, we found a crate of tropical seeds and planted them last night.

1855
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:52,560
And this morning, while you can see it's like magic.

1856
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,560
It's fantastic.

1857
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:57,560
I know. We can go on a safari.

1858
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:04,560
I've seen nothing like it.

1859
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:08,560
What kind of flower is this?

1860
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:10,560
It looks like an orchid to me.

1861
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:13,560
This is a real tropical jungle, isn't it, Snorkemaiden?

1862
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:14,560
Not quite.

1863
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:15,560
What do you mean?

1864
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:19,560
Well, Moomin, a real jungle would have wild animals in it, wouldn't it?

1865
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:21,560
Oh, yeah. Like tigers and snakes.

1866
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:25,560
This is more of a tropical botanical garden, I suppose.

1867
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:36,560
That's Moomin's little mind.

1868
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:38,560
He can have the peel.

1869
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:43,560
This is a life!

1870
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,560
Stop, Moomin!

1871
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:50,560
Well, well.

1872
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:55,560
What are you looking for, dear?

1873
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:56,560
My solar toady.

1874
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:57,560
You what?

1875
02:07:57,560 --> 02:08:00,560
My sun helmet. I can't go into the jungle without it.

1876
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:02,560
I didn't know you had one.

1877
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:04,560
I used it for a fancy dress party once.

1878
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:06,560
Oh, I put it in a box.

1879
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:07,560
Oh, yeah.

1880
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:09,560
Oh, here it is.

1881
02:08:09,560 --> 02:08:11,560
Very dashing, dear.

1882
02:08:11,560 --> 02:08:12,560
I thought so, too.

1883
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:14,560
Oh, I know.

1884
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:33,560
Splendid protection is had.

1885
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:41,560
Papa?

1886
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:43,560
What in earth are you doing?

1887
02:08:43,560 --> 02:08:45,560
I want to get into the cello.

1888
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:47,560
What for?

1889
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:49,560
To get my gun.

1890
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:50,560
Your gun?

1891
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:53,560
Only fools venture into the jungle without a proper gun.

1892
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:56,560
I don't think you need a gun, Papa.

1893
02:08:56,560 --> 02:08:57,560
And why not?

1894
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:59,560
Because there aren't any wild animals.

1895
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:03,560
Well, one of the seas might have been an egg or something.

1896
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:07,560
Look at these, for instance, they look very animal.

1897
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:11,560
Very odd animals.

1898
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:13,560
More of an odd plant, I think.

1899
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:14,560
I'd stay away from them.

1900
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:16,560
They could be very dangerous.

1901
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:18,560
Look, they've got eyes.

1902
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:19,560
Careful.

1903
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:21,560
I think they're man-eating plants.

1904
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:23,560
Man-eating.

1905
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:26,560
Stop that.

1906
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:28,560
Help!

1907
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:29,560
Help!

1908
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:31,560
Oh, they're trying to eat me.

1909
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:33,560
But they want to feed me to their young.

1910
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:35,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, help me!

1911
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:37,560
Oh, help!

1912
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:39,560
They're tearing my tail up!

1913
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:43,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1914
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:45,560
Oh, no, oh, dear.

1915
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:49,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.

1916
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:51,560
Help!

1917
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:57,560
Oh, oh, oh, no, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1918
02:09:57,560 --> 02:09:59,560
Well, done my little Maya.

1919
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:01,560
Just saved my life.

1920
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:03,560
Well, I saved your tail, anyway.

1921
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:05,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1922
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:08,900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1923
02:10:08,900 --> 02:10:11,480
Get something to jam this door shut.

1924
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:14,040
Come on, hurry!

1925
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:20,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, we can't hold on much longer.

1926
02:10:20,620 --> 02:10:22,620
Huh?

1927
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:38,620
That should keep them in now, shouldn't it?

1928
02:10:38,620 --> 02:10:41,620
Well, I don't think they could push their way through that lot.

1929
02:10:41,620 --> 02:10:43,620
They had a very strong grip on my tail.

1930
02:10:43,620 --> 02:10:45,620
He mustn't underestimate them.

1931
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:46,620
Anything wrong?

1932
02:10:46,620 --> 02:10:51,620
You bet! The seller's full of man-eating plants trying to gobble up moment papa!

1933
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:54,620
Oh! Oh my goodness!

1934
02:10:54,620 --> 02:10:55,620
What's the matter?

1935
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:58,620
You can get straight from the seller into the kitchen!

1936
02:10:58,620 --> 02:11:01,620
What? Oh no, mama!

1937
02:11:02,620 --> 02:11:04,620
Oh my gosh!

1938
02:11:14,620 --> 02:11:16,620
Oh, hello!

1939
02:11:16,620 --> 02:11:18,620
Cue, we got here just in time!

1940
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:21,620
Whatever's the matter with you, are you all playing Tarzan?

1941
02:11:21,620 --> 02:11:23,620
Oh no, mama!

1942
02:11:23,620 --> 02:11:26,620
I'm making grandmas if you ever get a tropical fruit recipe.

1943
02:11:26,620 --> 02:11:29,620
And perhaps now it's rained I can wash this dirty floor.

1944
02:11:32,620 --> 02:11:39,620
Oh, by the great bumble, I don't believe this a tropical rainforest.

1945
02:11:39,620 --> 02:11:44,620
Oh, a transcendentia megaloids.

1946
02:11:44,620 --> 02:11:47,620
And yes, a dyspepsia floremon.

1947
02:11:47,620 --> 02:11:52,620
Goodness me, I can collect a whole tropical hermoreum right here in moment valley.

1948
02:11:52,620 --> 02:11:56,620
I try, well, that's what I need. I'll get one from the Mormons.

1949
02:12:02,620 --> 02:12:05,620
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1950
02:12:05,620 --> 02:12:10,620
Must say they're not the tiniest family, I'll have to move this.

1951
02:12:10,620 --> 02:12:14,620
Oh, this old furniture.

1952
02:12:25,620 --> 02:12:27,620
Do I look that funny?

1953
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:29,620
No, you look great!

1954
02:12:29,620 --> 02:12:32,620
Maybe you and Tarzan have different muscles.

1955
02:12:32,620 --> 02:12:34,620
Me, Tarzan!

1956
02:12:34,620 --> 02:12:35,620
You, Jay!

1957
02:12:35,620 --> 02:12:36,620
Oh, oh!

1958
02:12:36,620 --> 02:12:38,620
Oh, here we go.

1959
02:12:38,620 --> 02:12:41,620
Me, get out, or me, sick!

1960
02:12:43,620 --> 02:12:44,620
Help!

1961
02:12:44,620 --> 02:12:47,620
I've got man-eating plants after this!

1962
02:12:47,620 --> 02:12:50,620
What? They must have come out!

1963
02:13:00,620 --> 02:13:04,620
They were in the cellar.

1964
02:13:04,620 --> 02:13:07,620
Did you open the door, Mr. Hamilon?

1965
02:13:07,620 --> 02:13:10,620
Well, yes, I wanted to borrow a trowel.

1966
02:13:10,620 --> 02:13:13,620
Mr. Hamilon, you know all about plants.

1967
02:13:13,620 --> 02:13:15,620
Do you have any idea how we can get rid of them?

1968
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:17,620
They're man-eaters, you know?

1969
02:13:17,620 --> 02:13:19,620
Can't rid of them.

1970
02:13:19,620 --> 02:13:22,620
Well, let's see. We are in a bit of a fix.

1971
02:13:22,620 --> 02:13:25,620
I have heard that they react to music.

1972
02:13:25,620 --> 02:13:27,620
Music.

1973
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:30,620
Snuffkin, you could play your harmonica.

1974
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:49,620
Look, they've started dancing.

1975
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:51,620
Keep it up, Snuffkin!

1976
02:13:57,620 --> 02:14:00,620
Music.

1977
02:14:08,620 --> 02:14:11,620
What will they do if he stops playing?

1978
02:14:11,620 --> 02:14:13,620
I really don't know.

1979
02:14:19,620 --> 02:14:21,620
Oh, what's this?

1980
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:33,620
They're rather sweet and they don't try to eat you.

1981
02:14:33,620 --> 02:14:38,620
And that was how a tropical jungle grew and surrounded

1982
02:14:38,620 --> 02:14:40,620
movement house in one night.

1983
02:14:40,620 --> 02:14:43,620
Is it going to stay and for how long?

1984
02:14:43,620 --> 02:14:48,620
And what will the man-eating plants do if Snuffkin stops playing?

1985
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:55,620
They love the laughter and they love the living.

1986
02:14:55,620 --> 02:14:58,620
The movements.

1987
02:14:58,620 --> 02:15:06,620
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1988
02:15:06,620 --> 02:15:10,620
They're always happy and always at play.

1989
02:15:10,620 --> 02:15:14,620
The movements are having fun day after day.

1990
02:15:14,620 --> 02:15:17,620
The movements.

1991
02:15:17,620 --> 02:15:21,620
The movements.

1992
02:15:21,620 --> 02:15:24,620
They love the laughter and they love the living.

1993
02:15:25,620 --> 02:15:28,620
The movements.

1994
02:15:28,620 --> 02:15:36,620
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1995
02:15:36,620 --> 02:15:40,620
They're always happy and always at play.

1996
02:15:40,620 --> 02:15:43,620
The movements are having fun day after day.

1997
02:15:43,620 --> 02:15:47,620
The movements.

1998
02:15:47,620 --> 02:15:50,620
The movements.

1999
02:15:50,620 --> 02:15:53,620
The movements.

2000
02:15:53,620 --> 02:15:56,620
The movements.

2001
02:16:16,620 --> 02:16:19,620
Here they are for one and all.

2002
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:22,620
The movements are about to come.

2003
02:16:22,620 --> 02:16:25,620
They want to sit down here with me.

2004
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:28,620
They're here for you on your TV.

2005
02:16:28,620 --> 02:16:31,620
They are the movements.

2006
02:16:31,620 --> 02:16:34,620
They are the movements.

2007
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:37,620
So come with me, give me your hand.

2008
02:16:37,620 --> 02:16:40,620
I'll take you up to a moment land.

2009
02:16:40,620 --> 02:16:43,620
You can fly just like a bird.

2010
02:16:43,620 --> 02:16:46,620
Sing the best song ever.

2011
02:16:46,620 --> 02:16:49,620
There were the movements.

2012
02:16:49,620 --> 02:16:52,620
There were the movements.

2013
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:55,620
There were the movements.

2014
02:16:55,620 --> 02:16:58,620
There were the movements.

2015
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:01,620
There were the movements.

2016
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:45,820
The seeds that movement and his friends had found in a box that had been cast up on the

2017
02:17:45,820 --> 02:17:53,820
beach had grown into a tropical forest. It was beautiful but also dangerous with man-eating plants

2018
02:17:53,820 --> 02:18:01,820
kept at bay by snuffkin playing his harmonica, but for how long?

2019
02:18:16,820 --> 02:18:23,820
snuffkin don't stop playing your harmonica whatever you do or they'll only get angry and attack us all over again.

2020
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:27,820
If I don't stop soon I might never want to play again.

2021
02:18:29,820 --> 02:18:33,820
Well perhaps the music has made them more friendly.

2022
02:18:33,820 --> 02:18:38,820
Be careful Mr. Himmelon. Oh don't worry.

2023
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:48,820
Mr. Himmelon look out.

2024
02:18:52,820 --> 02:18:54,820
I want him.

2025
02:18:54,820 --> 02:18:57,820
I don't think the quickly snuffkin play again.

2026
02:19:16,820 --> 02:19:27,820
Papa we must make sure the trap door won't open again.

2027
02:19:27,820 --> 02:19:30,820
Oh yes. What's this about a trap door?

2028
02:19:30,820 --> 02:19:35,820
In the kitchen they almost got him before in the tag mama. We reached her just in time.

2029
02:19:35,820 --> 02:19:38,820
Oh there they are.

2030
02:20:06,820 --> 02:20:08,820
I feel sorry for them.

2031
02:20:19,820 --> 02:20:26,820
It can't be helped snuffkin. If we let them out we'll be eaten alive.

2032
02:20:28,820 --> 02:20:33,820
It makes me feel very uncomfortable having man-eating plants under the floor.

2033
02:20:33,820 --> 02:20:38,820
Always keep a kettle of boiling water handy in case they break through.

2034
02:20:38,820 --> 02:20:41,820
The children are playing Tarzan.

2035
02:20:41,820 --> 02:20:45,820
They might as well seeing as they've got a jungle to play in.

2036
02:20:45,820 --> 02:20:48,820
Still planting those seeds might have been a terrible mistake.

2037
02:20:48,820 --> 02:20:57,820
Well mama I'm very glad that you did. Just think what I would have missed and movement values suddenly being full of tropical plants is wonderful.

2038
02:20:57,820 --> 02:21:01,820
I'm not fond of traveling as you know and you've brought the plants to me.

2039
02:21:02,820 --> 02:21:08,820
Well the trees make it much cooler but those man-eaters who I could do without them.

2040
02:21:16,820 --> 02:21:18,820
You're just like Tarzan.

2041
02:21:18,820 --> 02:21:20,820
Tarzan loves Jane.

2042
02:21:20,820 --> 02:21:22,820
Oh what bliss.

2043
02:21:25,820 --> 02:21:27,820
Stinky's over there.

2044
02:21:27,820 --> 02:21:30,820
Tarzan teach old Betty's lesson.

2045
02:21:45,820 --> 02:21:50,820
Pretty stupid moment playing Tarzan without wild animals.

2046
02:21:50,820 --> 02:21:52,820
Animals don't come from seeds.

2047
02:21:52,820 --> 02:21:56,820
No but you need them to have a real jungle. I can get you some if you want.

2048
02:21:56,820 --> 02:21:57,820
Really?

2049
02:21:57,820 --> 02:21:59,820
How do anything for my friends?

2050
02:21:59,820 --> 02:22:04,820
That's very kind of you. Not too wild though. No lions or tigers or anything.

2051
02:22:04,820 --> 02:22:07,820
Maybe it maybe chimpanzee.

2052
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:10,820
I know exactly what you need.

2053
02:22:13,820 --> 02:22:15,820
Cheese.

2054
02:22:15,820 --> 02:22:17,820
Bread.

2055
02:22:21,820 --> 02:22:23,820
What are you doing mama?

2056
02:22:23,820 --> 02:22:27,820
Well I don't like the thought of all those man-eaters still in the cellar.

2057
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:30,820
So your father and I are going to sleep in the bathhouse.

2058
02:22:30,820 --> 02:22:34,820
We'll sleep outdoors too. We've just built ourselves a hut.

2059
02:22:34,820 --> 02:22:36,820
Snorke maiden and little Mai too.

2060
02:22:36,820 --> 02:22:38,820
Oh yes there's plenty of room.

2061
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:42,820
Oh right so that only leaves Mr. Himmel and sleeping in the house.

2062
02:22:42,820 --> 02:22:45,820
And he still busy checking all the different plants.

2063
02:22:47,820 --> 02:22:49,820
Mama is everything ready?

2064
02:22:49,820 --> 02:22:51,820
Oh yes dear.

2065
02:22:54,820 --> 02:22:56,820
Oh I'm already.

2066
02:22:56,820 --> 02:22:58,820
Yes we are Mr. Himmel and.

2067
02:22:58,820 --> 02:23:00,820
See you later.

2068
02:23:06,820 --> 02:23:10,820
Stinky said he could get some wild animals papa.

2069
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:12,820
We'll have a frog.

2070
02:23:12,820 --> 02:23:13,820
I don't know.

2071
02:23:13,820 --> 02:23:16,820
I wouldn't trust him. He'll probably put a head jog in your sleeping bag.

2072
02:23:16,820 --> 02:23:19,820
There it is. The hut.

2073
02:23:19,820 --> 02:23:22,820
Oh very well built.

2074
02:23:49,820 --> 02:23:57,820
I tell you it's a wonderful place you love it. A real tropical jungle.

2075
02:23:57,820 --> 02:23:59,820
Are you sure it's quite nice here?

2076
02:23:59,820 --> 02:24:03,820
Of course I am. There you are.

2077
02:24:03,820 --> 02:24:05,820
Oh.

2078
02:24:19,820 --> 02:24:26,820
Oh lovely it is to run free.

2079
02:24:26,820 --> 02:24:33,820
Darling let's be the first to get to Moomin Valley.

2080
02:24:33,820 --> 02:24:40,820
Soon I'll have the largest collection in the botanic world.

2081
02:24:40,820 --> 02:24:45,820
And I will be famous and people will come from all over.

2082
02:24:45,820 --> 02:24:50,820
Now what have we here?

2083
02:24:50,820 --> 02:24:53,820
I don't know.

2084
02:24:53,820 --> 02:25:00,820
Go away I'm not a zoologist.

2085
02:25:00,820 --> 02:25:05,820
Look Moomin those must be the monkey stinky promise.

2086
02:25:05,820 --> 02:25:10,820
Well that's a surprise not like him at all.

2087
02:25:10,820 --> 02:25:14,820
I don't know.

2088
02:25:15,820 --> 02:25:20,820
Look Moomin those must be the monkey stinky promise.

2089
02:25:20,820 --> 02:25:23,820
Well that's a surprise not like him at all.

2090
02:25:23,820 --> 02:25:27,820
I just don't trust him.

2091
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:28,820
What sweet things.

2092
02:25:28,820 --> 02:25:32,820
Just like in Tarzan.

2093
02:25:32,820 --> 02:25:35,820
What was that?

2094
02:25:35,820 --> 02:25:37,820
I don't know.

2095
02:25:37,820 --> 02:25:46,820
That sounds like some really wild animal.

2096
02:25:46,820 --> 02:25:48,820
A lion or a tiger.

2097
02:25:48,820 --> 02:25:55,820
I'm frightened Moomin.

2098
02:26:01,820 --> 02:26:06,820
Very odd just like home isn't it even if it isn't very big?

2099
02:26:06,820 --> 02:26:08,820
Perhaps we could live here.

2100
02:26:08,820 --> 02:26:12,820
Let's go hunting first I smell Moomin's.

2101
02:26:12,820 --> 02:26:20,820
Oh be careful darling you're very out of practice.

2102
02:26:20,820 --> 02:26:26,820
I must warn them.

2103
02:26:26,820 --> 02:26:28,820
See anything?

2104
02:26:28,820 --> 02:26:29,820
No other thing.

2105
02:26:29,820 --> 02:26:33,820
It must have been imagination.

2106
02:26:33,820 --> 02:26:35,820
Moomin.

2107
02:26:35,820 --> 02:26:37,820
Keep quiet.

2108
02:26:37,820 --> 02:26:40,820
I've just seen some tigers they're coming to get you.

2109
02:26:40,820 --> 02:26:41,820
Tigers.

2110
02:26:41,820 --> 02:26:43,820
Let's get back to the house quick.

2111
02:26:43,820 --> 02:26:46,820
There's no time they're nearly here.

2112
02:26:46,820 --> 02:26:50,820
We'll go to the bathhouse.

2113
02:27:04,820 --> 02:27:06,820
Shall we eat him up?

2114
02:27:06,820 --> 02:27:10,820
You know that Hamilins upset your tummy dearest.

2115
02:27:10,820 --> 02:27:14,820
I wonder where the Moomin's are.

2116
02:27:14,820 --> 02:27:17,820
Huh?

2117
02:27:20,820 --> 02:27:24,820
Just more animals that's all.

2118
02:27:25,820 --> 02:27:31,820
Papa!

2119
02:27:31,820 --> 02:27:34,820
Papa help!

2120
02:27:39,820 --> 02:27:41,820
What's the matter Moomin?

2121
02:27:41,820 --> 02:27:44,820
Little Maya's seen two tigers and they're looking for us.

2122
02:27:44,820 --> 02:27:45,820
Tigers after us.

2123
02:27:45,820 --> 02:27:49,820
That rotten sticky probably told them we're good to eat or something.

2124
02:27:49,820 --> 02:27:51,820
Maybe we are.

2125
02:27:51,820 --> 02:27:53,820
They'll be here in a minute.

2126
02:27:53,820 --> 02:27:56,820
Right Moomin, you go and find the biggest stone you can

2127
02:27:56,820 --> 02:27:58,820
and bring it back with you.

2128
02:27:58,820 --> 02:28:00,820
Okay.

2129
02:28:09,820 --> 02:28:12,820
This way.

2130
02:28:23,820 --> 02:28:25,820
Papa will this one do?

2131
02:28:25,820 --> 02:28:26,820
Yes, that's perfect.

2132
02:28:26,820 --> 02:28:29,820
Right, get into the bathhouse and it's quickly now.

2133
02:28:54,820 --> 02:28:56,820
Here they come.

2134
02:29:02,820 --> 02:29:04,820
Are you really going to eat them, dearest?

2135
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:05,820
Of course, my love.

2136
02:29:05,820 --> 02:29:09,820
You see, I think they're hiding in that little house up there.

2137
02:29:09,820 --> 02:29:13,820
They're being very quiet if they are.

2138
02:29:13,820 --> 02:29:18,820
Huh, they're just too scared to move. That's all.

2139
02:29:18,820 --> 02:29:21,820
Why's that stone there?

2140
02:29:24,820 --> 02:29:26,820
Whoa!

2141
02:29:29,820 --> 02:29:31,820
My darling!

2142
02:29:31,820 --> 02:29:32,820
It worked, Papa!

2143
02:29:32,820 --> 02:29:34,820
Well, of course, Moomin.

2144
02:29:36,820 --> 02:29:38,820
My husband is drowning.

2145
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:42,820
Oh, I'm so sorry. Papa, we must help.

2146
02:29:42,820 --> 02:29:45,820
He was just about to try and eat us, Mama.

2147
02:29:45,820 --> 02:29:48,820
I'm sure he won't do it again.

2148
02:29:49,820 --> 02:29:53,820
I suppose so, Moomin.

2149
02:30:12,820 --> 02:30:14,820
Oh, my love!

2150
02:30:14,820 --> 02:30:16,820
I never thought I'd see the day.

2151
02:30:16,820 --> 02:30:19,820
Moomin's rescuing a tiger.

2152
02:30:20,820 --> 02:30:21,820
Here you are, dear.

2153
02:30:21,820 --> 02:30:24,820
Tie this tightly around him and we'll lift him out.

2154
02:30:24,820 --> 02:30:26,820
Thank you, Mama.

2155
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:46,820
Oh, darling.

2156
02:30:47,820 --> 02:30:49,820
Oh, you are right, my love.

2157
02:30:49,820 --> 02:30:51,820
What happened? Did we eat them?

2158
02:30:51,820 --> 02:30:53,820
No, you were drowning and they rescued you.

2159
02:30:53,820 --> 02:30:56,820
Oh, now embarrassing.

2160
02:30:56,820 --> 02:30:59,820
Well, they're in that cabin behind you if you still feel hungry,

2161
02:30:59,820 --> 02:31:02,820
but it was rather good of them to save you.

2162
02:31:02,820 --> 02:31:05,820
No, my appetite's completely gone.

2163
02:31:05,820 --> 02:31:07,820
We'll come back here then and we'll go.

2164
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:09,820
I'll just jump over.

2165
02:31:14,820 --> 02:31:16,820
Oh.

2166
02:31:16,820 --> 02:31:18,820
What's the matter?

2167
02:31:18,820 --> 02:31:20,820
I can't remember how to jump.

2168
02:31:20,820 --> 02:31:22,820
We've been stuck in that zoo for too long.

2169
02:31:22,820 --> 02:31:24,820
Well, try and swim across, dear.

2170
02:31:26,820 --> 02:31:28,820
Okay.

2171
02:31:30,820 --> 02:31:32,820
Hmm?

2172
02:31:38,820 --> 02:31:42,820
Wake up, everyone. The tiger's all leaving.

2173
02:31:42,820 --> 02:31:44,820
I'm glad he didn't grow.

2174
02:31:48,820 --> 02:31:52,820
I knew they wouldn't be mean enough to eat us after saving him.

2175
02:31:52,820 --> 02:31:55,820
Shall we jump in and swim back as well? It's not far.

2176
02:31:55,820 --> 02:31:58,820
Oh, yes. I'll go first.

2177
02:31:58,820 --> 02:32:00,820
I want to go first.

2178
02:32:00,820 --> 02:32:03,820
Darling, are you all right? Be careful, Moomin.

2179
02:32:03,820 --> 02:32:05,820
Look over there.

2180
02:32:10,820 --> 02:32:11,820
Crocodiles.

2181
02:32:11,820 --> 02:32:15,820
Oh, hurry up, Moomin. Swim around the back and come up the ladder.

2182
02:32:26,820 --> 02:32:29,820
How can there be crocodiles in the sea?

2183
02:32:29,820 --> 02:32:31,820
I thought they only lived in fresh water.

2184
02:32:31,820 --> 02:32:33,820
How are we going to get back to the shore now?

2185
02:32:33,820 --> 02:32:36,820
We'll have to wait for a boat to come past.

2186
02:32:36,820 --> 02:32:39,820
No, I'm afraid we'll have to think of something else, Mama.

2187
02:32:39,820 --> 02:32:43,820
We could have been waiting for a wink or so for that to happen.

2188
02:32:43,820 --> 02:32:45,820
A whole week!

2189
02:32:45,820 --> 02:32:49,820
But we'll starve. All they'll find is our bones bleached, waiting to sun.

2190
02:32:49,820 --> 02:32:53,820
Don't worry, little mind. Papa will think of something you'll see.

2191
02:32:53,820 --> 02:32:55,820
Good morning.

2192
02:32:56,820 --> 02:32:59,820
Snuffkin, what are you leaving?

2193
02:32:59,820 --> 02:33:03,820
I was going to go sea fishing, but I changed my mind.

2194
02:33:03,820 --> 02:33:06,820
I didn't fancy landing a sea monster.

2195
02:33:10,820 --> 02:33:16,820
Help! Someone help! Help anybody!

2196
02:33:16,820 --> 02:33:18,820
That's Mr. Hemmulin.

2197
02:33:18,820 --> 02:33:21,820
Oh, the tigers must be after him quickly.

2198
02:33:31,820 --> 02:33:33,820
Who had ever made you so cross?

2199
02:33:33,820 --> 02:33:36,820
I just told you not to eat my plants.

2200
02:33:37,820 --> 02:33:40,820
Please, someone help!

2201
02:33:44,820 --> 02:33:46,820
Let me in!

2202
02:33:54,820 --> 02:33:56,820
That fella's always been clumsy.

2203
02:33:56,820 --> 02:33:58,820
We can't really help him.

2204
02:33:58,820 --> 02:34:00,820
No.

2205
02:34:01,820 --> 02:34:02,820
Oh!

2206
02:34:05,820 --> 02:34:07,820
Are you alright, Hemmulin?

2207
02:34:07,820 --> 02:34:09,820
Oh, dear, I think so.

2208
02:34:09,820 --> 02:34:11,820
What about you?

2209
02:34:11,820 --> 02:34:14,820
What do you do when a rhino gets stuck in your brando?

2210
02:34:14,820 --> 02:34:16,820
This is a new one on me.

2211
02:34:16,820 --> 02:34:18,820
So I'm loose. I can't think of any other way.

2212
02:34:18,820 --> 02:34:20,820
You have to be very careful, though.

2213
02:34:20,820 --> 02:34:22,820
I think you're right.

2214
02:34:22,820 --> 02:34:24,820
Yes, thank you.

2215
02:34:31,820 --> 02:34:33,820
Ah, look where you're going.

2216
02:34:33,820 --> 02:34:36,820
It was you who brought all the animals in, wasn't it?

2217
02:34:36,820 --> 02:34:38,820
Yes, you're right. That's what you wanted.

2218
02:34:38,820 --> 02:34:40,820
It's a jungle now. I did a good job.

2219
02:34:40,820 --> 02:34:43,820
Oh, really? Well, they're not wild animals at all.

2220
02:34:43,820 --> 02:34:45,820
They're quite friendly.

2221
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:47,820
Friendly?

2222
02:35:01,820 --> 02:35:03,820
Hmm.

2223
02:35:08,820 --> 02:35:09,820
See what I mean?

2224
02:35:09,820 --> 02:35:10,820
They make very good pets.

2225
02:35:10,820 --> 02:35:12,820
Cute, aren't they?

2226
02:35:20,820 --> 02:35:23,820
Snake! Go stick where are you?

2227
02:35:25,820 --> 02:35:26,820
Why do you want?

2228
02:35:26,820 --> 02:35:29,820
The rhino and the tigers have become pets of the movement family.

2229
02:35:29,820 --> 02:35:32,820
You're not going to let that happen to you.

2230
02:35:32,820 --> 02:35:33,820
Well, are you?

2231
02:35:33,820 --> 02:35:34,820
It's not.

2232
02:35:34,820 --> 02:35:36,820
I'll bring snorked maiden and movement here tonight.

2233
02:35:36,820 --> 02:35:38,820
There's no need to eat all of them.

2234
02:35:38,820 --> 02:35:41,820
Just bite off their tails, all right?

2235
02:35:41,820 --> 02:35:43,820
Okay.

2236
02:35:45,820 --> 02:35:47,820
You'll be really amazed like I was.

2237
02:35:47,820 --> 02:35:50,820
It's big enough for both of you to sit on.

2238
02:35:50,820 --> 02:35:52,820
How lovely. A giant water lily.

2239
02:35:52,820 --> 02:35:56,820
I wonder if the seeds came from that box you all found.

2240
02:35:56,820 --> 02:35:58,820
Oh, I can't wait to see it.

2241
02:35:59,820 --> 02:36:01,820
Looking at the size of the jungle,

2242
02:36:01,820 --> 02:36:04,820
there must have been an awful lot of seeds in that box.

2243
02:36:04,820 --> 02:36:07,820
I suppose the wind could have blown them anywhere.

2244
02:36:09,820 --> 02:36:11,820
Where's the giant water lily?

2245
02:36:11,820 --> 02:36:13,820
Let's see now.

2246
02:36:13,820 --> 02:36:15,820
Over there.

2247
02:36:21,820 --> 02:36:23,820
How wonderful.

2248
02:36:23,820 --> 02:36:26,820
You see, I wish you'd learn to trust me.

2249
02:36:26,820 --> 02:36:29,820
It's a very honest guy.

2250
02:36:29,820 --> 02:36:32,820
It's so soft and pink and beautiful.

2251
02:36:38,820 --> 02:36:41,820
How romantic to be on a boat made from a flower.

2252
02:36:41,820 --> 02:36:43,820
This is unbelievable.

2253
02:36:43,820 --> 02:36:46,820
Our old box seems to have grown into a tropical swamp.

2254
02:36:46,820 --> 02:36:48,820
It's a lot nicer.

2255
02:36:48,820 --> 02:36:50,820
Hey, stinky.

2256
02:36:50,820 --> 02:36:52,820
Stinky?

2257
02:36:52,820 --> 02:36:55,820
Oh, I can't see him anywhere.

2258
02:36:57,820 --> 02:37:00,820
I wonder how far we'll float.

2259
02:37:00,820 --> 02:37:02,820
It's getting dark, moment.

2260
02:37:13,820 --> 02:37:15,820
Gotcha.

2261
02:37:15,820 --> 02:37:17,820
We must get away.

2262
02:37:17,820 --> 02:37:19,820
I don't know yet.

2263
02:37:19,820 --> 02:37:21,820
Look, there's the seed.

2264
02:37:21,820 --> 02:37:23,820
Put the crooked aisles.

2265
02:37:23,820 --> 02:37:25,820
Over there, snorkemaid.

2266
02:37:25,820 --> 02:37:26,820
I suppose.

2267
02:37:26,820 --> 02:37:30,820
Well, it's the only way we'll get away from this monster.

2268
02:37:48,820 --> 02:37:50,820
Keep going, snorkmaid.

2269
02:37:50,820 --> 02:37:52,820
We're almost there.

2270
02:37:53,820 --> 02:37:55,820
Wait.

2271
02:37:55,820 --> 02:37:59,820
Moomin and snorkmaid kept swimming as fast as they could.

2272
02:37:59,820 --> 02:38:01,820
They had a head start on the snake,

2273
02:38:01,820 --> 02:38:03,820
but now he was catching up.

2274
02:38:03,820 --> 02:38:06,820
Even though movements are very good swimmers,

2275
02:38:06,820 --> 02:38:09,820
unfortunately for them, so are snakes.

2276
02:38:12,820 --> 02:38:14,820
They love the laughter,

2277
02:38:14,820 --> 02:38:18,820
and they love the living the movements.

2278
02:38:19,820 --> 02:38:26,820
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2279
02:38:26,820 --> 02:38:30,820
They're always happy and always at play.

2280
02:38:30,820 --> 02:38:34,820
The movements are having fun day after day.

2281
02:38:34,820 --> 02:38:37,820
The movements.

2282
02:38:37,820 --> 02:38:41,820
The movements.

2283
02:38:41,820 --> 02:38:43,820
They love the laughter,

2284
02:38:43,820 --> 02:38:47,820
and they love the living the movements.

2285
02:38:48,820 --> 02:38:55,820
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2286
02:38:55,820 --> 02:38:59,820
They're always happy and always at play.

2287
02:38:59,820 --> 02:39:03,820
The movements are having fun day after day.

2288
02:39:03,820 --> 02:39:06,820
The movements.

2289
02:39:06,820 --> 02:39:10,820
The movements.

2290
02:39:10,820 --> 02:39:16,820
The movements.

2291
02:39:18,820 --> 02:39:23,820
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2292
02:39:49,820 --> 02:39:53,820
They are the movements.

2293
02:39:53,820 --> 02:39:56,820
So come with me, give me your hand.

2294
02:39:56,820 --> 02:39:59,820
I'll take you up to a moment land.

2295
02:39:59,820 --> 02:40:02,820
You can fly just like a bird.

2296
02:40:02,820 --> 02:40:04,820
Sing that song ever.

2297
02:40:04,820 --> 02:40:07,820
There were the movements.

2298
02:40:07,820 --> 02:40:10,820
There were the movements.

2299
02:40:10,820 --> 02:40:13,820
There were the movements.

2300
02:40:13,820 --> 02:40:16,820
There were the movements.

2301
02:40:16,820 --> 02:40:21,820
There were the movements.

2302
02:40:46,820 --> 02:40:51,820
There were the movements.

2303
02:40:51,820 --> 02:40:56,820
There were the movements.

2304
02:40:56,820 --> 02:41:04,820
There were the movements.

2305
02:41:04,820 --> 02:41:07,820
Move in.

2306
02:41:07,820 --> 02:41:09,820
Where are you moving?

2307
02:41:09,820 --> 02:41:12,820
It's not made in.

2308
02:41:12,820 --> 02:41:15,820
The rhino and the tigers that stinky set free from the zoo

2309
02:41:15,820 --> 02:41:18,820
are now living in the jungle that has grown up around movement house

2310
02:41:18,820 --> 02:41:24,820
and have settled into the restful life of movement valley.

2311
02:41:24,820 --> 02:41:26,820
Hey, have you seen movement?

2312
02:41:26,820 --> 02:41:29,820
No, you haven't seen him all evening.

2313
02:41:29,820 --> 02:41:33,820
I wonder where they got to.

2314
02:41:33,820 --> 02:41:36,820
Meanwhile, movement and snort made and chased by the snake

2315
02:41:36,820 --> 02:41:41,820
are swimming as fast as they can out to sea.

2316
02:41:41,820 --> 02:41:43,820
I can't swim another.

2317
02:41:43,820 --> 02:41:47,820
Snort must snort made and you must.

2318
02:41:47,820 --> 02:41:54,820
Hey, hey you there.

2319
02:41:54,820 --> 02:41:57,820
Come on, snort made and nearly there.

2320
02:41:57,820 --> 02:41:59,820
Look, there's a couple of hippos.

2321
02:41:59,820 --> 02:42:00,820
They're coming towards us.

2322
02:42:00,820 --> 02:42:01,820
We better get them on board.

2323
02:42:01,820 --> 02:42:02,820
That's funny.

2324
02:42:02,820 --> 02:42:06,820
I haven't heard about any hippos reported missing from the zoo lately.

2325
02:42:06,820 --> 02:42:16,820
Just a bit further snort made it.

2326
02:42:16,820 --> 02:42:18,820
We made it.

2327
02:42:18,820 --> 02:42:22,820
I didn't know hippos could climb so well.

2328
02:42:22,820 --> 02:42:24,820
Oh, thank you so much.

2329
02:42:24,820 --> 02:42:26,820
There was a huge snake chasing us.

2330
02:42:26,820 --> 02:42:29,820
Yes, we saw you were lucky we came along when we did.

2331
02:42:29,820 --> 02:42:30,820
Thank you for your help.

2332
02:42:30,820 --> 02:42:32,820
Whose ship is this?

2333
02:42:32,820 --> 02:42:33,820
ours.

2334
02:42:33,820 --> 02:42:34,820
We're from the zoo.

2335
02:42:34,820 --> 02:42:37,820
Oh, you've got one of the crocodiles.

2336
02:42:37,820 --> 02:42:40,820
Yes, and a lot of trouble he gave us as well.

2337
02:42:40,820 --> 02:42:42,820
There's another one around here somewhere.

2338
02:42:42,820 --> 02:42:43,820
We saw them.

2339
02:42:43,820 --> 02:42:46,820
Yes, we know there is, but we haven't been able to find him yet.

2340
02:42:46,820 --> 02:42:50,820
Oh boy, I wish they'd come as quietly as you hippos did.

2341
02:42:50,820 --> 02:42:51,820
Hippos.

2342
02:42:51,820 --> 02:42:52,820
Hippos.

2343
02:42:52,820 --> 02:42:53,820
Hippos.

2344
02:42:53,820 --> 02:42:54,820
Which zoo are you from?

2345
02:42:54,820 --> 02:42:56,820
I bet they'd pay well to get you back.

2346
02:42:56,820 --> 02:42:57,820
Now, look here.

2347
02:42:57,820 --> 02:42:59,820
I'm a woman, not a hippo.

2348
02:42:59,820 --> 02:43:01,820
Are you saying that I look like a hippo?

2349
02:43:01,820 --> 02:43:04,820
Well, perhaps they don't look exactly like a hippo.

2350
02:43:04,820 --> 02:43:07,820
No, but they're close enough, Captain.

2351
02:43:07,820 --> 02:43:10,820
I'm sure they've escaped from the zoo somewhere, though.

2352
02:43:10,820 --> 02:43:11,820
Yes, sir.

2353
02:43:11,820 --> 02:43:13,820
We haven't escaped from anywhere.

2354
02:43:13,820 --> 02:43:14,820
Certainly not a zoo.

2355
02:43:14,820 --> 02:43:15,820
We live in Moomin Valley.

2356
02:43:15,820 --> 02:43:16,820
We're Moomin's.

2357
02:43:16,820 --> 02:43:17,820
It's all right, Snork Maiden.

2358
02:43:17,820 --> 02:43:19,820
I'll not be taken for a hippo.

2359
02:43:19,820 --> 02:43:21,820
Come on, let's run for it.

2360
02:43:21,820 --> 02:43:22,820
Hey, wait.

2361
02:43:22,820 --> 02:43:24,820
There's a nice cozy cage already for you.

2362
02:43:24,820 --> 02:43:26,820
Hurry, Snork Maiden.

2363
02:43:26,820 --> 02:43:27,820
Ask to them.

2364
02:43:27,820 --> 02:43:28,820
Stop them now.

2365
02:43:28,820 --> 02:43:30,820
Don't let them get away.

2366
02:43:31,820 --> 02:43:33,820
Where are we going, Moomin?

2367
02:43:33,820 --> 02:43:34,820
Now, let's see.

2368
02:43:37,820 --> 02:43:39,820
Quickly, man, lower the live boat.

2369
02:43:39,820 --> 02:43:42,820
If they're not going to put us in any zoo.

2370
02:43:46,820 --> 02:43:48,820
Why did you come back?

2371
02:43:48,820 --> 02:43:50,820
I thought you were on the boat.

2372
02:43:50,820 --> 02:43:51,820
Oh, no.

2373
02:43:51,820 --> 02:43:52,820
Don't worry.

2374
02:43:52,820 --> 02:43:54,820
I never eat anything when I'm not swimming.

2375
02:43:54,820 --> 02:43:55,820
Are you sure?

2376
02:43:55,820 --> 02:43:56,820
I'm sure.

2377
02:43:56,820 --> 02:43:58,820
Now where's this ship?

2378
02:43:59,820 --> 02:44:01,820
Oh, they're catching up with us.

2379
02:44:01,820 --> 02:44:03,820
They want to put us in a cage and take us to the zoo.

2380
02:44:03,820 --> 02:44:05,820
Me too, I expect.

2381
02:44:05,820 --> 02:44:07,820
They're always trying to get me.

2382
02:44:07,820 --> 02:44:08,820
They've got one of the crocodiles.

2383
02:44:08,820 --> 02:44:09,820
Oh, did they?

2384
02:44:09,820 --> 02:44:10,820
They were my friends.

2385
02:44:10,820 --> 02:44:11,820
Right.

2386
02:44:11,820 --> 02:44:12,820
Hang on to me, you two.

2387
02:44:12,820 --> 02:44:15,820
I'm certainly not going back to any zoo.

2388
02:44:15,820 --> 02:44:16,820
Never, let's go.

2389
02:44:18,820 --> 02:44:19,820
Oh, no.

2390
02:44:19,820 --> 02:44:20,820
Now hold on tight.

2391
02:44:22,820 --> 02:44:23,820
Come back.

2392
02:44:23,820 --> 02:44:24,820
You horrible ripper.

2393
02:44:24,820 --> 02:44:25,820
Come back.

2394
02:44:29,820 --> 02:44:31,820
The moment's been caught by a big snake.

2395
02:44:31,820 --> 02:44:34,820
Yes, mama snorked maiden as well.

2396
02:44:34,820 --> 02:44:36,820
Dear stinky, that's not true, is it?

2397
02:44:36,820 --> 02:44:39,820
I wish people wouldn't realize that I almost never lie.

2398
02:44:39,820 --> 02:44:42,820
I'm sorry about them, but I thought I'd better tell you.

2399
02:44:42,820 --> 02:44:45,820
Oh, there aren't any snakes that big in movement valley.

2400
02:44:45,820 --> 02:44:47,820
There are tigers here, aren't there?

2401
02:44:47,820 --> 02:44:49,820
Well, there's big snakes too.

2402
02:44:49,820 --> 02:44:51,820
You brought the snake here, didn't you?

2403
02:44:51,820 --> 02:44:54,820
Papa, I'm not saying that I believe him.

2404
02:44:54,820 --> 02:44:57,820
But I think we'd better look for them just to be on the safe side, don't you?

2405
02:44:58,820 --> 02:44:59,820
Okay, don't believe me.

2406
02:44:59,820 --> 02:45:01,820
I've told you so my conscience is clear.

2407
02:45:01,820 --> 02:45:04,820
Where exactly did the snake attack them, stinky?

2408
02:45:04,820 --> 02:45:06,820
Down in the swamp by the sea.

2409
02:45:06,820 --> 02:45:07,820
Let's go, mama.

2410
02:45:08,820 --> 02:45:09,820
I'll come with you.

2411
02:45:09,820 --> 02:45:13,820
No, you'd better stay little my until movement where we've gone if he comes back.

2412
02:45:13,820 --> 02:45:16,820
He'll only worry if there's no one here.

2413
02:45:16,820 --> 02:45:18,820
And stinky, you'll show us where to go.

2414
02:45:18,820 --> 02:45:19,820
Okay.

2415
02:45:20,820 --> 02:45:22,820
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2416
02:45:22,820 --> 02:45:24,820
Oh, I'll move.

2417
02:45:24,820 --> 02:45:25,820
Hey, you!

2418
02:45:25,820 --> 02:45:27,820
Have you eaten, movement, and snork made it?

2419
02:45:27,820 --> 02:45:29,820
It's all right, mama. We're here.

2420
02:45:29,820 --> 02:45:31,820
Oh, praise the boobie-goobie-goobie-goobie-goobie-goobie-goobie.

2421
02:45:31,820 --> 02:45:33,820
Me time, you friend.

2422
02:45:33,820 --> 02:45:35,820
You're a very big friend.

2423
02:45:35,820 --> 02:45:38,820
Please come in as much of you as you like.

2424
02:45:38,820 --> 02:45:40,820
Stinky just told us that you and Snork's are here.

2425
02:45:40,820 --> 02:45:42,820
Hey, you, I'm here.

2426
02:45:42,820 --> 02:45:43,820
Hey, you, I'm here.

2427
02:45:43,820 --> 02:45:44,820
Hey, you, I'm here.

2428
02:45:44,820 --> 02:45:45,820
Hey, you, I'm here.

2429
02:45:45,820 --> 02:45:46,820
Hey, you, I'm here.

2430
02:45:46,820 --> 02:45:47,820
Hey, you, I'm here.

2431
02:45:47,820 --> 02:45:49,820
Stinky just told us that you and Snork made it

2432
02:45:49,820 --> 02:45:51,820
been caught by a big snake, so we...

2433
02:45:51,820 --> 02:45:53,820
Where are you going, Stinky?

2434
02:45:53,820 --> 02:45:56,820
She did chase us at first.

2435
02:45:56,820 --> 02:45:58,820
Then we managed to get on a boat, but they wanted

2436
02:45:58,820 --> 02:45:59,820
to put us in a cage.

2437
02:45:59,820 --> 02:46:01,820
So we jumped back in the sea, met the snake again.

2438
02:46:01,820 --> 02:46:03,820
Then they tried to catch her too.

2439
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:05,820
So she helped us to get away, and now she's our friend.

2440
02:46:05,820 --> 02:46:07,820
Who are they?

2441
02:46:07,820 --> 02:46:08,820
Men from the zoo.

2442
02:46:08,820 --> 02:46:11,820
They've come to recapture all the animals and take them away

2443
02:46:11,820 --> 02:46:14,820
from the jungle and put them in cages again.

2444
02:46:14,820 --> 02:46:15,820
Nice.

2445
02:46:15,820 --> 02:46:17,820
Secondly, don't want to go back to the zoo.

2446
02:46:17,820 --> 02:46:20,820
Papa, we've got to protect our friends.

2447
02:46:20,820 --> 02:46:21,820
Yes, we have.

2448
02:46:21,820 --> 02:46:24,820
I'm sure that the tigers and that nice rhino don't want to

2449
02:46:24,820 --> 02:46:25,820
go back even.

2450
02:46:25,820 --> 02:46:27,820
Oh, of course they don't.

2451
02:46:27,820 --> 02:46:29,820
They want to be free and live in our jungle.

2452
02:46:29,820 --> 02:46:31,820
Why don't you go and explore it?

2453
02:46:31,820 --> 02:46:33,820
I'm sure it'll be just like home.

2454
02:46:33,820 --> 02:46:35,820
And if you see the zoo people, you can come back here,

2455
02:46:35,820 --> 02:46:37,820
can't you?

2456
02:46:37,820 --> 02:46:39,820
I'm sure you'll like it here, Mrs. Snake.

2457
02:46:39,820 --> 02:46:41,820
Yes, I'm sure I will.

2458
02:46:41,820 --> 02:46:43,820
Come on, I'll show you the jungle.

2459
02:46:44,820 --> 02:46:50,820
I'm so relieved that you're both all right at home.

2460
02:46:50,820 --> 02:46:54,820
So are we, Mama, but there's something we haven't told you.

2461
02:46:54,820 --> 02:46:57,820
Yes, they thought we were hippopotamuses.

2462
02:46:57,820 --> 02:46:58,820
What?

2463
02:46:58,820 --> 02:46:59,820
Who did?

2464
02:46:59,820 --> 02:47:01,820
They need their eyes, Destiny.

2465
02:47:01,820 --> 02:47:03,820
The men from the zoo.

2466
02:47:03,820 --> 02:47:05,820
They thought we had escaped from another zoo,

2467
02:47:05,820 --> 02:47:08,820
and we're trying to catch us, and they nearly succeeded.

2468
02:47:08,820 --> 02:47:09,820
How rude.

2469
02:47:09,820 --> 02:47:12,820
We're not at all like hippos, the cheek of it.

2470
02:47:12,820 --> 02:47:15,820
So these men were only trying to capture our new friends,

2471
02:47:15,820 --> 02:47:17,820
but you and Snork Maiden as well.

2472
02:47:17,820 --> 02:47:19,820
And me and Papa if they'd known about us.

2473
02:47:19,820 --> 02:47:20,820
That's right, Mama.

2474
02:47:20,820 --> 02:47:21,820
They're idiots.

2475
02:47:21,820 --> 02:47:24,820
Hippopotamuses don't wear aprons or right memoirs.

2476
02:47:24,820 --> 02:47:26,820
That's really made me angry.

2477
02:47:26,820 --> 02:47:30,820
I bet they never faced the wrath of a movement Papa before.

2478
02:47:30,820 --> 02:47:35,820
I want to see you wrap yourself round and choke somebody.

2479
02:47:35,820 --> 02:47:37,820
I know. How about the tiger?

2480
02:47:37,820 --> 02:47:38,820
He do.

2481
02:47:38,820 --> 02:47:39,820
I'd rather not.

2482
02:47:39,820 --> 02:47:41,820
We became friends in the zoo.

2483
02:47:43,820 --> 02:47:44,820
Oh, I know.

2484
02:47:44,820 --> 02:47:46,820
Choke stinky. That'll be much better.

2485
02:47:46,820 --> 02:47:49,820
Yes, my dewey did let us out of the zoo.

2486
02:47:52,820 --> 02:47:54,820
Well, you're a great disappointment to me.

2487
02:47:54,820 --> 02:47:56,820
I let you out because I thought you'd attack the movements,

2488
02:47:56,820 --> 02:47:58,820
but you have tea with them instead.

2489
02:47:58,820 --> 02:48:00,820
You're pathetic, you know that?

2490
02:48:00,820 --> 02:48:02,820
I'm sorry, but we were brought up in captivity,

2491
02:48:02,820 --> 02:48:04,820
and we never had to hunt for our food.

2492
02:48:04,820 --> 02:48:07,820
All our meals are brought to us, you see.

2493
02:48:07,820 --> 02:48:10,820
But your tigers, what do you eat them?

2494
02:48:10,820 --> 02:48:13,820
Well, we love cat food.

2495
02:48:13,820 --> 02:48:14,820
Cat food.

2496
02:48:14,820 --> 02:48:17,820
Oh, I don't believe it.

2497
02:48:17,820 --> 02:48:21,820
Yes, it's easy to chew and it leaves our fur all sleep and shiny.

2498
02:48:21,820 --> 02:48:24,820
We like the yellow tins with the black cat, don't we, honey?

2499
02:48:24,820 --> 02:48:25,820
Yes, it's our favorite.

2500
02:48:25,820 --> 02:48:28,820
You wouldn't happen to have any on you, would you?

2501
02:48:38,820 --> 02:48:39,820
Mama!

2502
02:48:39,820 --> 02:48:41,820
Papa, quickly!

2503
02:48:42,820 --> 02:48:43,820
They're here.

2504
02:48:43,820 --> 02:48:44,820
The zoo men are here.

2505
02:48:44,820 --> 02:48:48,820
Oh, get all the animals into the house first, you.

2506
02:48:48,820 --> 02:48:50,820
Hurry, moment.

2507
02:48:50,820 --> 02:48:51,820
Okay, Papa.

2508
02:48:54,820 --> 02:48:57,820
The zoo men have come to get you.

2509
02:48:57,820 --> 02:48:58,820
Oh, I know.

2510
02:48:58,820 --> 02:48:59,820
I know.

2511
02:48:59,820 --> 02:49:00,820
I know.

2512
02:49:00,820 --> 02:49:01,820
I know.

2513
02:49:01,820 --> 02:49:02,820
I know.

2514
02:49:02,820 --> 02:49:03,820
I know.

2515
02:49:03,820 --> 02:49:04,820
I know.

2516
02:49:05,820 --> 02:49:07,820
The zoo men have come to get you.

2517
02:49:07,820 --> 02:49:10,820
Hurry, you'll be safe in the moment house.

2518
02:49:10,820 --> 02:49:12,820
Quick as you can, Rhino.

2519
02:49:12,820 --> 02:49:13,820
Into the house.

2520
02:49:13,820 --> 02:49:14,820
Go on.

2521
02:49:19,820 --> 02:49:21,820
Now, Rhino, push him.

2522
02:49:21,820 --> 02:49:22,820
I'm sorry.

2523
02:49:35,820 --> 02:49:40,820
Um, I don't think that's a good place to hide, Mrs. Snake.

2524
02:49:43,820 --> 02:49:46,820
I'm afraid that doesn't look quite right, Tiger.

2525
02:49:46,820 --> 02:49:49,820
I thought I might just look like a thick rug.

2526
02:49:49,820 --> 02:49:52,820
I'll just lie here like a beautiful porcelain ornament.

2527
02:49:52,820 --> 02:49:55,820
They'll never know we're here, darling.

2528
02:49:55,820 --> 02:49:59,820
Well, they'd never expect to find a Rhino under there.

2529
02:49:59,820 --> 02:50:00,820
That's what I thought.

2530
02:50:00,820 --> 02:50:01,820
Where are they?

2531
02:50:02,820 --> 02:50:03,820
Well, where are they?

2532
02:50:03,820 --> 02:50:06,820
They can't just have vanished into thin air.

2533
02:50:08,820 --> 02:50:09,820
Hmm.

2534
02:50:09,820 --> 02:50:10,820
Look, up there.

2535
02:50:12,820 --> 02:50:13,820
In the chimney.

2536
02:50:18,820 --> 02:50:20,820
So they're in there, are they?

2537
02:50:32,820 --> 02:50:33,820
Papa!

2538
02:50:35,820 --> 02:50:36,820
They've seen the snake.

2539
02:50:36,820 --> 02:50:37,820
They're nearly here.

2540
02:50:40,820 --> 02:50:43,820
Now, I want you to calm down and be quiet, everyone.

2541
02:50:43,820 --> 02:50:45,820
We won't let them take you away.

2542
02:50:45,820 --> 02:50:48,820
I promise you they'll have a fight on the ends if they try.

2543
02:50:48,820 --> 02:50:50,820
Teeth, please, my father.

2544
02:50:50,820 --> 02:50:51,820
Of course, dear.

2545
02:51:02,820 --> 02:51:03,820
Hello.

2546
02:51:05,820 --> 02:51:06,820
Hello.

2547
02:51:08,820 --> 02:51:09,820
Hello.

2548
02:51:09,820 --> 02:51:10,820
Hello.

2549
02:51:17,820 --> 02:51:19,820
Hello, having a picnic, are you?

2550
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:20,820
It's lovely day for you.

2551
02:51:20,820 --> 02:51:21,820
Not at all.

2552
02:51:21,820 --> 02:51:23,820
We're all here from the zoo, sir.

2553
02:51:23,820 --> 02:51:25,820
Oh, are you on some sort of expedition?

2554
02:51:25,820 --> 02:51:28,820
Excuse me, but are you the owner of this house?

2555
02:51:28,820 --> 02:51:29,820
Yes, indeed.

2556
02:51:29,820 --> 02:51:30,820
I am.

2557
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:31,820
I'm moving, Papa.

2558
02:51:31,820 --> 02:51:32,820
Well, what can I do for you?

2559
02:51:32,820 --> 02:51:35,820
Well, you could send out the animals hiding in your house.

2560
02:51:35,820 --> 02:51:37,820
That'll do for a start.

2561
02:51:37,820 --> 02:51:38,820
Animals?

2562
02:51:38,820 --> 02:51:39,820
Oh, no.

2563
02:51:39,820 --> 02:51:42,820
We have firm believers that they belong outside.

2564
02:51:42,820 --> 02:51:46,820
Sir, you can't see from where you are, but I can assure you that there is a python

2565
02:51:46,820 --> 02:51:48,820
sticking its head out of your chimney.

2566
02:51:48,820 --> 02:51:49,820
A python?

2567
02:51:49,820 --> 02:51:51,820
Yes, that's right.

2568
02:51:51,820 --> 02:51:53,820
No, it isn't.

2569
02:51:53,820 --> 02:51:54,820
It isn't.

2570
02:51:54,820 --> 02:51:56,820
No, it's my daughter.

2571
02:51:56,820 --> 02:51:58,820
She happens to look like a python.

2572
02:51:58,820 --> 02:52:00,820
Not all the time you understand.

2573
02:52:00,820 --> 02:52:01,820
Right.

2574
02:52:01,820 --> 02:52:02,820
Come on, man.

2575
02:52:02,820 --> 02:52:04,820
We'll go and get the zoo's property.

2576
02:52:04,820 --> 02:52:07,820
No, you will not enter my house.

2577
02:52:07,820 --> 02:52:08,820
All right.

2578
02:52:08,820 --> 02:52:09,820
Well, you let the animals out.

2579
02:52:09,820 --> 02:52:10,820
We won't have to.

2580
02:52:10,820 --> 02:52:11,820
It's up to you, sir.

2581
02:52:11,820 --> 02:52:14,820
There are no animals, and you won't enter my house.

2582
02:52:14,820 --> 02:52:15,820
Now, wait a minute.

2583
02:52:15,820 --> 02:52:16,820
I do believe, yes.

2584
02:52:16,820 --> 02:52:19,820
You're one of those hippos, aren't you?

2585
02:52:19,820 --> 02:52:20,820
I am not.

2586
02:52:20,820 --> 02:52:21,820
I'm moving, Papa.

2587
02:52:21,820 --> 02:52:23,820
And I am the owner of this house.

2588
02:52:23,820 --> 02:52:24,820
No, you're not.

2589
02:52:24,820 --> 02:52:25,820
You're a hippopotamus.

2590
02:52:25,820 --> 02:52:26,820
Yeah.

2591
02:52:26,820 --> 02:52:28,820
A hippo who owns a house.

2592
02:52:28,820 --> 02:52:30,820
And it's also running in an illegal zoo.

2593
02:52:30,820 --> 02:52:31,820
Break down the doors.

2594
02:52:31,820 --> 02:52:32,820
Huh.

2595
02:52:32,820 --> 02:52:34,820
That is against the law.

2596
02:52:34,820 --> 02:52:35,820
Oh, it is, isn't it?

2597
02:52:35,820 --> 02:52:37,820
Well, there's a nice cage winning for you as well.

2598
02:52:37,820 --> 02:52:39,820
A woman, Papa, hippo.

2599
02:52:39,820 --> 02:52:41,820
I warn you, if you touch that door,

2600
02:52:41,820 --> 02:52:42,820
you'll regret it.

2601
02:52:42,820 --> 02:52:43,820
Go, yeah?

2602
02:52:45,820 --> 02:52:46,820
Great boys.

2603
02:52:46,820 --> 02:52:47,820
Let's go in.

2604
02:52:47,820 --> 02:52:48,820
Charge.

2605
02:52:48,820 --> 02:52:49,820
Charge.

2606
02:52:49,820 --> 02:52:50,820
Charge!

2607
02:53:10,320 --> 02:53:12,820
hall.

2608
02:53:12,820 --> 02:53:14,820
Now, then, what's going on?

2609
02:53:14,820 --> 02:53:17,820
Little mice brought the inspector.

2610
02:53:17,820 --> 02:53:19,820
What do you mean that you're doing?

2611
02:53:19,820 --> 02:53:22,700
Ah, they're hiding animals from the zoo in this house.

2612
02:53:22,700 --> 02:53:23,700
We want them back.

2613
02:53:23,700 --> 02:53:26,460
I tried to reason with the hippo, but it was no good.

2614
02:53:26,460 --> 02:53:30,460
Oh, have you know that's willful destruction of property, my good man?

2615
02:53:30,460 --> 02:53:32,460
It's not willful, we're from the zoo.

2616
02:53:32,460 --> 02:53:33,860
We gotta get in somehow.

2617
02:53:33,860 --> 02:53:37,860
Oh, have you, and can you be sure that there are zoo animals in there?

2618
02:53:38,860 --> 02:53:40,860
You just take a look up there at the chimney.

2619
02:53:40,860 --> 02:53:42,180
That's all I'm sure.

2620
02:53:42,180 --> 02:53:43,180
Go on.

2621
02:53:45,060 --> 02:53:47,060
See that python's head sticking out?

2622
02:53:48,340 --> 02:53:49,260
That's on.

2623
02:53:49,260 --> 02:53:51,260
I can't see a python's head.

2624
02:53:51,260 --> 02:53:53,780
But there was a python's head up there, I saw it.

2625
02:53:55,580 --> 02:53:56,580
I can't breathe.

2626
02:53:58,580 --> 02:54:00,580
Now you listen to me, zoo man.

2627
02:54:01,580 --> 02:54:04,620
Either you stop bothering my friends or I'll arrest you.

2628
02:54:04,620 --> 02:54:05,460
Is that clear?

2629
02:54:05,460 --> 02:54:06,740
Well, is it?

2630
02:54:06,740 --> 02:54:07,740
Yes, sir, it is.

2631
02:54:07,740 --> 02:54:09,980
But what about the zoo animals?

2632
02:54:09,980 --> 02:54:12,460
You heard the inspector now go away.

2633
02:54:12,460 --> 02:54:13,300
Do you see that?

2634
02:54:13,300 --> 02:54:14,100
See what?

2635
02:54:14,100 --> 02:54:14,980
The hippopotamus.

2636
02:54:14,980 --> 02:54:15,740
What?

2637
02:54:15,740 --> 02:54:16,740
The hippopotamus.

2638
02:54:16,740 --> 02:54:19,100
He's a fellow's been hiding all our zoo animals.

2639
02:54:19,100 --> 02:54:21,540
We got a nice cage lined up for him as well, inspector.

2640
02:54:21,540 --> 02:54:23,500
Oh, so that's your plan, isn't it?

2641
02:54:23,500 --> 02:54:25,220
Ha, they want to take them all.

2642
02:54:25,220 --> 02:54:28,140
Moomin, snork, me, mama, and papa.

2643
02:54:28,140 --> 02:54:30,060
Hmm, the criminal conspiracy.

2644
02:54:30,060 --> 02:54:31,140
Conspiracy?

2645
02:54:31,140 --> 02:54:33,620
It would probably be called kidnapping.

2646
02:54:33,620 --> 02:54:35,660
Once you can't kidnap a hippo.

2647
02:54:35,660 --> 02:54:37,660
That's a movement.

2648
02:54:37,660 --> 02:54:39,580
It could be white slavery, though.

2649
02:54:39,580 --> 02:54:43,220
I'm sure I could add incitement to riot to the list.

2650
02:54:43,220 --> 02:54:45,380
Now I hate paperwork, so I'll tell you one.

2651
02:54:45,420 --> 02:54:47,900
If you're gone within 10 minutes, I won't arrest you.

2652
02:54:47,900 --> 02:54:50,460
Why don't you put them in the deepest dungeon, inspector?

2653
02:54:50,460 --> 02:54:52,820
The one with all the rats and spiders and scorpions

2654
02:54:52,820 --> 02:54:55,100
that'll teach them to put Moomin's encages.

2655
02:54:55,100 --> 02:54:56,820
That's a good idea, little mind.

2656
02:54:56,820 --> 02:54:59,260
They like animals.

2657
02:54:59,260 --> 02:55:01,780
I'll start counting now.

2658
02:55:01,780 --> 02:55:05,020
One, two, three.

2659
02:55:05,020 --> 02:55:08,460
Get around men quickly.

2660
02:55:08,460 --> 02:55:10,140
We'll have to think quickly on this one, men.

2661
02:55:10,140 --> 02:55:12,780
Come on, now, does anybody have any smart ideas?

2662
02:55:12,780 --> 02:55:14,460
Come on, we're running out of time.

2663
02:55:16,380 --> 02:55:17,660
One minute.

2664
02:55:17,660 --> 02:55:19,980
Look, guys, we're going to figure something out right now.

2665
02:55:19,980 --> 02:55:20,820
Ready and look.

2666
02:55:20,820 --> 02:55:24,060
One minute, 30 seconds.

2667
02:55:24,060 --> 02:55:25,060
Two minutes.

2668
02:55:25,060 --> 02:55:26,900
Three minutes, 30 seconds.

2669
02:55:26,900 --> 02:55:28,100
Look, leave us alone.

2670
02:55:28,100 --> 02:55:29,420
Way of work and faring.

2671
02:55:29,420 --> 02:55:32,220
All right, six minutes and 50 seconds.

2672
02:55:32,220 --> 02:55:33,260
Time's up.

2673
02:55:33,260 --> 02:55:34,300
You're cheating.

2674
02:55:34,300 --> 02:55:38,180
The police don't cheat, and now you've got nine minutes

2675
02:55:38,180 --> 02:55:39,700
and 30 seconds.

2676
02:55:39,700 --> 02:55:40,740
How about that?

2677
02:55:40,740 --> 02:55:42,100
Nine minutes, 50 bucks?

2678
02:55:42,100 --> 02:55:43,060
I give up.

2679
02:55:43,060 --> 02:55:44,500
Everybody beat it.

2680
02:55:44,500 --> 02:55:46,100
But we're still discussing it.

2681
02:55:46,100 --> 02:55:46,700
No, we're not.

2682
02:55:46,700 --> 02:55:48,100
We're getting out.

2683
02:55:48,100 --> 02:55:48,940
Look, everyone.

2684
02:55:48,940 --> 02:55:52,220
The zoom in, and we're running off.

2685
02:55:52,220 --> 02:55:53,340
Great.

2686
02:55:53,340 --> 02:55:55,460
You've got to come and see this, Mama.

2687
02:55:55,460 --> 02:55:58,060
Nine minutes and 50 and a half seconds.

2688
02:55:58,060 --> 02:55:59,140
And don't come back.

2689
02:55:59,140 --> 02:56:00,860
We'll be the dungeon for you.

2690
02:56:00,860 --> 02:56:03,460
And I make that 10 minutes up to you.

2691
02:56:03,460 --> 02:56:05,060
You saved this little mind.

2692
02:56:05,060 --> 02:56:07,540
It was really clever of you to fetch the inspector.

2693
02:56:07,540 --> 02:56:10,340
Well, there were too many of them for me to fight.

2694
02:56:10,340 --> 02:56:11,020
OK?

2695
02:56:11,020 --> 02:56:12,940
Everyone, come on now.

2696
02:56:15,460 --> 02:56:19,220
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

2697
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:21,180
And so everyone was saved.

2698
02:56:21,180 --> 02:56:23,180
And eventually, they all came out of the house

2699
02:56:23,180 --> 02:56:25,620
to go and have fun in the jungle again.

2700
02:56:25,620 --> 02:56:27,220
As long as the warm weather lasted,

2701
02:56:27,220 --> 02:56:28,660
there were plenty of things to do.

2702
02:56:28,660 --> 02:56:31,460
But one day, the weather changed.

2703
02:56:31,460 --> 02:56:33,620
And cold winds blew down Mumen Valley.

2704
02:56:36,620 --> 02:56:39,300
It feels like autumn has arrived.

2705
02:56:39,300 --> 02:56:41,500
The jungle won't like the cold weather.

2706
02:56:41,500 --> 02:56:44,140
Do you think it will die, Mama?

2707
02:56:44,140 --> 02:56:45,940
I'm afraid it will, little mind.

2708
02:56:45,940 --> 02:56:47,380
It grew very quickly.

2709
02:56:47,380 --> 02:56:51,420
So perhaps it will go the same way.

2710
02:56:51,420 --> 02:56:52,660
And it did.

2711
02:56:52,660 --> 02:56:56,060
The whole jungle with it and died in just one night.

2712
02:57:02,300 --> 02:57:04,340
I think I've done a cold coming, Mama.

2713
02:57:04,340 --> 02:57:05,180
I'm sorry.

2714
02:57:05,180 --> 02:57:06,820
I can't get the house any hotter.

2715
02:57:06,820 --> 02:57:07,820
I missed the zoo.

2716
02:57:07,820 --> 02:57:09,340
At least it was warm now.

2717
02:57:09,340 --> 02:57:11,740
Yes, this cold is awful.

2718
02:57:11,740 --> 02:57:14,180
It would warm them up if we weren't the dead jungle.

2719
02:57:31,260 --> 02:57:32,460
Now they're happy again.

2720
02:57:32,460 --> 02:57:33,460
But for how long?

2721
02:57:41,740 --> 02:57:48,740
Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys.

2722
02:57:48,740 --> 02:57:49,740
It's cold again.

2723
02:57:49,740 --> 02:57:51,740
It was warm in our cages.

2724
02:57:51,740 --> 02:57:53,740
What are you afraid here?

2725
02:57:53,740 --> 02:57:55,740
Yes, free to have pneumonia.

2726
02:57:55,740 --> 02:58:00,740
I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spending the winter here.

2727
02:58:00,740 --> 02:58:02,740
And so all the animals,

2728
02:58:02,740 --> 02:58:04,740
decided to return to the zoo.

2729
02:58:04,740 --> 02:58:08,740
Perhaps we'll let you come back next summer, Mrs. Snake?

2730
02:58:08,740 --> 02:58:09,740
I like that.

2731
02:58:09,740 --> 02:58:10,740
When it's warmer.

2732
02:58:14,740 --> 02:58:17,740
Hey, look, the animals are on their way back.

2733
02:58:17,740 --> 02:58:19,740
Oh, Ray!

2734
02:58:19,740 --> 02:58:20,740
That wonderful.

2735
02:58:20,740 --> 02:58:22,740
Oh, it's good to see you.

2736
02:58:22,740 --> 02:58:23,740
You're welcome.

2737
02:58:23,740 --> 02:58:24,740
I'm so excited.

2738
02:58:24,740 --> 02:58:25,740
I'm so excited.

2739
02:58:25,740 --> 02:58:26,740
I'm so excited.

2740
02:58:26,740 --> 02:58:27,740
I'm so excited.

2741
02:58:27,740 --> 02:58:28,740
I'm so excited.

2742
02:58:28,740 --> 02:58:29,740
I'm so excited.

2743
02:58:29,740 --> 02:58:30,740
I'm so excited.

2744
02:58:30,740 --> 02:58:32,740
Oh, it's good to see you.

2745
02:58:32,740 --> 02:58:34,740
You don't know how much we missed you.

2746
02:58:34,740 --> 02:58:35,740
Oh, good.

2747
02:58:35,740 --> 02:58:36,740
Gosh.

2748
02:58:36,740 --> 02:58:38,740
We'll come back right now, old fella.

2749
02:58:38,740 --> 02:58:39,740
It's good to see you.

2750
02:58:39,740 --> 02:58:40,740
Come on now.

2751
02:58:40,740 --> 02:58:41,740
Get back to your cages quickly.

2752
02:58:41,740 --> 02:58:43,740
We've been keeping them nice and warm for you.

2753
02:58:43,740 --> 02:58:45,740
Go on, off you go now.

2754
02:58:45,740 --> 02:58:48,740
You look all right, but I'm sure you must all be starving.

2755
02:58:48,740 --> 02:58:51,740
We'll do you a special meal tonight, all right?

2756
02:58:51,740 --> 02:58:53,740
Ah, the hippos, too.

2757
02:58:53,740 --> 02:58:55,740
For the last time, we're moments.

2758
02:58:55,740 --> 02:58:56,740
Not hippos.

2759
02:58:56,740 --> 02:58:57,740
You must be cold as well.

2760
02:58:57,740 --> 02:58:59,740
We'll warm up a cage for you.

2761
02:58:59,740 --> 02:59:00,740
It'll be nice and cozy, there.

2762
02:59:00,740 --> 02:59:01,740
No.

2763
02:59:01,740 --> 02:59:02,740
No.

2764
02:59:02,740 --> 02:59:04,740
It just came to send the animals off.

2765
02:59:04,740 --> 02:59:06,740
Hey, get a cage ready for the hippos.

2766
02:59:06,740 --> 02:59:07,740
Will you?

2767
02:59:07,740 --> 02:59:08,740
Nice and warm.

2768
02:59:08,740 --> 02:59:11,740
At the risk of sounding repetitive, we are moments.

2769
02:59:11,740 --> 02:59:12,740
Don't be ridiculous.

2770
02:59:12,740 --> 02:59:14,740
You're mullet here.

2771
02:59:14,740 --> 02:59:16,740
But we're nothing like hippos.

2772
02:59:16,740 --> 02:59:18,740
We know you're not purebred, but the public

2773
02:59:18,740 --> 02:59:20,740
will never be able to tell.

2774
02:59:20,740 --> 02:59:27,740
Do we have to stay here forever, Papa?

2775
02:59:27,740 --> 02:59:29,740
Of course not, Momen.

2776
02:59:29,740 --> 02:59:31,740
Don't worry. I'll think of something.

2777
02:59:31,740 --> 02:59:32,740
You will, won't you?

2778
02:59:32,740 --> 02:59:34,740
Have you got any ideas?

2779
02:59:34,740 --> 02:59:38,740
Well, not yet, but I am a writer, you know.

2780
02:59:42,740 --> 02:59:44,740
Don't cry, Snorth Maiden.

2781
02:59:44,740 --> 02:59:46,740
I'm sure there won't be only hay to eat.

2782
02:59:46,740 --> 02:59:49,740
I don't mind as long as we're together.

2783
02:59:49,740 --> 02:59:52,740
But what if they put us in separate cages?

2784
02:59:52,740 --> 02:59:53,740
No.

2785
02:59:53,740 --> 02:59:56,740
Well, that would be awful if they wouldn't do that.

2786
02:59:56,740 --> 03:00:00,740
Well, perhaps the inspector will come looking for us.

2787
03:00:00,740 --> 03:00:03,740
When he realizes that we've gone as well as the animals,

2788
03:00:03,740 --> 03:00:06,740
he'll bring the full power of the Lord to bear on them.

2789
03:00:06,740 --> 03:00:08,740
Oh, look, there's someone coming.

2790
03:00:08,740 --> 03:00:09,740
It's Snorth Maiden.

2791
03:00:09,740 --> 03:00:10,740
And Hamilton.

2792
03:00:10,740 --> 03:00:11,740
And a little Mai.

2793
03:00:11,740 --> 03:00:13,740
Snorth Maiden.

2794
03:00:15,740 --> 03:00:16,740
Hi, Moomin.

2795
03:00:17,740 --> 03:00:20,740
Don't worry. We'll have you guys out in just a minute.

2796
03:00:23,740 --> 03:00:24,740
Please come out.

2797
03:00:27,740 --> 03:00:30,740
Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to let you out.

2798
03:00:30,740 --> 03:00:32,740
I'm in charge of this zoo.

2799
03:00:32,740 --> 03:00:34,740
I'm afraid it was quite an understandable mistake.

2800
03:00:34,740 --> 03:00:38,740
But please accept this token of apology from the Board of Trustees.

2801
03:00:38,740 --> 03:00:40,740
Here you are, madam.

2802
03:00:40,740 --> 03:00:43,740
Mr. Hemelon and I went to the Royal Academy of Science

2803
03:00:43,740 --> 03:00:45,740
just to sort all this out.

2804
03:00:45,740 --> 03:00:47,740
We've been given a letter from the President

2805
03:00:47,740 --> 03:00:49,740
stating that you are not hippos.

2806
03:00:49,740 --> 03:00:52,740
Mr. Hemelon's scientific background helped persuade him.

2807
03:00:52,740 --> 03:00:54,740
So you can all come home now.

2808
03:00:55,740 --> 03:00:59,740
Well, it just goes to show you must never judge by appearances alone.

2809
03:01:02,740 --> 03:01:03,740
Mama.

2810
03:01:03,740 --> 03:01:04,740
Yes, Papa.

2811
03:01:04,740 --> 03:01:06,740
Do you think I should grow a beard?

2812
03:01:06,740 --> 03:01:08,740
No, Papa.

2813
03:01:15,740 --> 03:01:18,740
And so autumn came to Moomin Valley.

2814
03:01:18,740 --> 03:01:22,740
A new season with different weather and different pleasures.

2815
03:01:29,740 --> 03:01:36,740
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

2816
03:01:36,740 --> 03:01:43,740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2817
03:01:43,740 --> 03:01:47,740
They're always happy and always at play.

2818
03:01:47,740 --> 03:01:50,740
The movements are having fun day after day.

2819
03:01:50,740 --> 03:01:54,740
The movements.

2820
03:01:54,740 --> 03:01:58,740
The movements.

2821
03:01:58,740 --> 03:02:05,740
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

2822
03:02:05,740 --> 03:02:12,740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2823
03:02:12,740 --> 03:02:16,740
They're always happy and always at play.

2824
03:02:16,740 --> 03:02:20,740
The movements are having fun day after day.

2825
03:02:20,740 --> 03:02:24,740
The movements.

2826
03:02:24,740 --> 03:02:27,740
The movements.

2827
03:02:27,740 --> 03:02:34,740
The movements.

2828
03:02:42,740 --> 03:02:53,740
The movements.

2829
03:02:53,740 --> 03:02:56,740
Here they are for one and all.

2830
03:02:56,740 --> 03:02:59,740
The movements are about to come.

2831
03:02:59,740 --> 03:03:02,740
Come on and sit down here with me.

2832
03:03:02,740 --> 03:03:07,740
There for you on your TV they are the movements.

2833
03:03:07,740 --> 03:03:10,740
They are the movements.

2834
03:03:10,740 --> 03:03:13,740
If so come with me give me your hand.

2835
03:03:13,740 --> 03:03:16,740
I'll take you up to Moomin Land.

2836
03:03:16,740 --> 03:03:19,740
You can fly just like a bird.

2837
03:03:19,740 --> 03:03:21,740
Sing that song ever.

2838
03:03:21,740 --> 03:03:24,740
There were the movements.

2839
03:03:24,740 --> 03:03:27,740
There were the movements.

2840
03:03:27,740 --> 03:03:30,740
There were the movements.

2841
03:03:30,740 --> 03:03:33,740
There were the movements.

2842
03:03:33,740 --> 03:03:36,740
There were the movements.

2843
03:03:36,740 --> 03:03:39,740
There were the movements.

2844
03:03:39,740 --> 03:03:42,740
There were the movements.

2845
03:03:42,740 --> 03:03:45,740
There were the movements.

2846
03:03:45,740 --> 03:03:48,740
There were the movements.

2847
03:03:48,740 --> 03:03:51,740
There were the movements.

2848
03:03:51,740 --> 03:03:54,740
There were the movements.

2849
03:03:54,740 --> 03:03:57,740
There were the movements.

2850
03:03:57,740 --> 03:04:01,740
There were the movements.

2851
03:04:01,740 --> 03:04:05,740
There were the movements.

2852
03:04:05,740 --> 03:04:14,740
There were the movements.

2853
03:04:14,740 --> 03:04:22,740
Fall has come to Moomin Valley and the memory of sunshine filled hours fades as the days become shorter and the nights longer.

2854
03:04:22,740 --> 03:04:28,740
The wind blows away the falling leaves and the blue skies of summer are now gray and cloudy.

2855
03:04:28,740 --> 03:04:32,740
Winter is just around the corner.

2856
03:04:32,740 --> 03:04:38,740
Snork made it.

2857
03:04:38,740 --> 03:04:40,740
Where are you going?

2858
03:04:40,740 --> 03:04:43,740
Oh I'm just taking my brother his lunch little my.

2859
03:04:43,740 --> 03:04:46,740
He must have nearly finished the flying ship by now.

2860
03:04:46,740 --> 03:04:47,740
Oh no.

2861
03:04:47,740 --> 03:04:50,740
Not even snork works that quickly.

2862
03:04:50,740 --> 03:04:52,740
Well have you seen it?

2863
03:04:52,740 --> 03:04:53,740
No I haven't.

2864
03:04:53,740 --> 03:04:55,740
He won't even let me come into his workshop.

2865
03:04:55,740 --> 03:04:58,740
Is he afraid it'll disappear if someone sees it?

2866
03:04:58,740 --> 03:05:02,740
He hasn't said why but I suppose all great inventors have to be very careful.

2867
03:05:02,740 --> 03:05:05,740
Someone might want to steal their ideas.

2868
03:05:05,740 --> 03:05:08,740
Moomin told me he's dying to have a look at it.

2869
03:05:18,740 --> 03:05:20,740
Hey Moomin open the door.

2870
03:05:20,740 --> 03:05:22,740
I've got my hands full.

2871
03:05:22,740 --> 03:05:24,740
Come on quickly.

2872
03:05:24,740 --> 03:05:26,740
Look what I've got.

2873
03:05:26,740 --> 03:05:29,740
It's a 100 player.

2874
03:05:38,740 --> 03:05:40,740
Do you think you can get it working dear?

2875
03:05:40,740 --> 03:05:42,740
Oh yes of course mom.

2876
03:05:42,740 --> 03:05:45,740
Why do people always give me things that are broken.

2877
03:05:45,740 --> 03:05:50,740
It'd be nice to have something that worked for a change.

2878
03:05:50,740 --> 03:05:53,740
Moomin Papa will get it working for you.

2879
03:05:53,740 --> 03:05:56,740
My auntie said that the record was alright though.

2880
03:05:56,740 --> 03:05:57,740
It's dance music.

2881
03:05:57,740 --> 03:05:59,740
She's had it for ages but I've never heard it.

2882
03:05:59,740 --> 03:06:00,740
Oh that's nice.

2883
03:06:00,740 --> 03:06:04,740
It's years since I danced but it seems like only yesterday.

2884
03:06:04,740 --> 03:06:06,740
Do you remember what funny was Papa?

2885
03:06:06,740 --> 03:06:08,740
Dancing.

2886
03:06:08,740 --> 03:06:09,740
Oh yeah.

2887
03:06:09,740 --> 03:06:11,740
I see.

2888
03:06:11,740 --> 03:06:13,740
Have you fixed it Papa?

2889
03:06:14,740 --> 03:06:15,740
Huh?

2890
03:06:15,740 --> 03:06:17,740
I can hear music.

2891
03:06:17,740 --> 03:06:19,740
Doesn't sound like snuffkin.

2892
03:06:44,740 --> 03:06:47,740
Right have you got the idea now?

2893
03:06:47,740 --> 03:06:49,740
Yes I think so.

2894
03:06:49,740 --> 03:06:51,740
Me too.

2895
03:06:51,740 --> 03:06:52,740
Come on.

2896
03:06:52,740 --> 03:06:55,740
Oh let's see you then.

2897
03:06:55,740 --> 03:06:57,740
May I?

2898
03:06:57,740 --> 03:07:01,740
Did I do it?

2899
03:07:01,740 --> 03:07:03,740
Oh wow.

2900
03:07:04,740 --> 03:07:06,740
Look at Papa Moomin.

2901
03:07:06,740 --> 03:07:09,740
He's a great dancer.

2902
03:07:33,740 --> 03:07:35,740
Well then can you dance snuff?

2903
03:07:35,740 --> 03:07:36,740
I've never tried.

2904
03:07:36,740 --> 03:07:39,740
Right well try now.

2905
03:08:04,740 --> 03:08:12,740
Oh that was fun.

2906
03:08:12,740 --> 03:08:15,740
Oh dancing never you still wear me out like this.

2907
03:08:15,740 --> 03:08:18,740
You've got no sense of rhythm at all Sniff.

2908
03:08:18,740 --> 03:08:21,740
I can still dance though can I?

2909
03:08:21,740 --> 03:08:23,740
Oh are you ready Papa?

2910
03:08:23,740 --> 03:08:26,740
I think I'll have to sit this one out Mama.

2911
03:08:26,740 --> 03:08:28,740
Alright.

2912
03:08:29,740 --> 03:08:31,740
Little one.

2913
03:08:31,740 --> 03:08:32,740
No thank you.

2914
03:08:32,740 --> 03:08:33,740
I'll dance on my own.

2915
03:08:33,740 --> 03:08:34,740
Well then.

2916
03:08:34,740 --> 03:08:36,740
Why don't you dance with me and Sniff?

2917
03:08:36,740 --> 03:08:38,740
Ah.

2918
03:08:52,740 --> 03:08:55,740
Oh it looks like it's here for the day.

2919
03:08:59,740 --> 03:09:04,740
Oh what horrible weather Snuffkin.

2920
03:09:04,740 --> 03:09:05,740
Yes.

2921
03:09:05,740 --> 03:09:07,740
They're having fun.

2922
03:09:07,740 --> 03:09:11,740
Well Sniff brought this old record player over and we've been dancing.

2923
03:09:11,740 --> 03:09:13,740
I haven't done it for years and years.

2924
03:09:13,740 --> 03:09:15,740
Well aren't you coming in?

2925
03:09:15,740 --> 03:09:19,740
I can smell winter in the air Moomin Papa.

2926
03:09:19,740 --> 03:09:24,740
Oh yes you're right.

2927
03:09:29,740 --> 03:09:33,740
Sniffkin why?

2928
03:09:38,740 --> 03:09:40,740
Sniffkin come and dance with me.

2929
03:09:40,740 --> 03:09:42,740
No thanks of mine.

2930
03:09:47,740 --> 03:09:49,740
Sorry.

2931
03:09:49,740 --> 03:09:51,740
I'm sorry.

2932
03:09:51,740 --> 03:09:53,740
Oh you.

2933
03:09:59,740 --> 03:10:03,740
Hmm what's the matter with this?

2934
03:10:06,740 --> 03:10:08,740
I'm afraid it's broken.

2935
03:10:08,740 --> 03:10:10,740
Just when we were having so much fun.

2936
03:10:10,740 --> 03:10:12,740
Will you be able to fix it again dear?

2937
03:10:12,740 --> 03:10:14,740
No even I can't mend it now.

2938
03:10:14,740 --> 03:10:17,740
Oh please try Papa will you?

2939
03:10:17,740 --> 03:10:21,740
Snuffkin do you know anything about record players?

2940
03:10:21,740 --> 03:10:23,740
No I'm afraid not.

2941
03:10:23,740 --> 03:10:24,740
Oh dear.

2942
03:10:24,740 --> 03:10:25,740
But what?

2943
03:10:25,740 --> 03:10:29,740
I'll play my harmonic if you want to continue to dance and then you can fiddle around with the machine.

2944
03:10:29,740 --> 03:10:31,740
How would that be?

2945
03:10:31,740 --> 03:10:34,740
Oh yes please that would be great Snuffkin thanks.

2946
03:10:34,740 --> 03:10:37,740
Now then what would be a good tune to dance to?

2947
03:10:37,740 --> 03:10:39,740
Let's see.

2948
03:10:56,740 --> 03:10:59,740
Oh no.

2949
03:11:10,740 --> 03:11:12,740
Now what's this?

2950
03:11:12,740 --> 03:11:16,740
Oh no I give up.

2951
03:11:18,740 --> 03:11:21,740
May I?

2952
03:11:25,740 --> 03:11:28,740
You're thinking about going away again aren't you Snuffkin?

2953
03:11:28,740 --> 03:11:30,740
Hmm.

2954
03:11:30,740 --> 03:11:36,740
I know that you go south every year when winter comes but I'll still miss you though and I wish you could stay here in Moomin Valley.

2955
03:11:36,740 --> 03:11:39,740
I know Moomin.

2956
03:11:40,740 --> 03:11:42,740
Who are they?

2957
03:11:42,740 --> 03:11:45,740
How do you know I expect to be?

2958
03:11:45,740 --> 03:11:46,740
I don't know.

2959
03:11:46,740 --> 03:11:49,740
I'm just a little bit nervous.

2960
03:11:49,740 --> 03:11:52,740
I'm just a little nervous.

2961
03:11:52,740 --> 03:11:57,740
You're thinking about going away again aren't you Snuffkin?

2962
03:11:57,740 --> 03:11:59,740
Hmm.

2963
03:11:59,740 --> 03:12:05,740
I know that you go south every year when winter comes, but I'll still miss you though and I wish you could stay here in Moomin Valley.

2964
03:12:05,740 --> 03:12:08,740
I know Moomin.

2965
03:12:08,740 --> 03:12:10,740
But I don't know I expect.

2966
03:12:10,740 --> 03:12:14,740
Probably the best place for them.

2967
03:12:14,740 --> 03:12:16,740
When are you leaving Snuffkin?

2968
03:12:16,740 --> 03:12:18,740
Oh I haven't decided yet.

2969
03:12:18,740 --> 03:12:22,740
So you'll be here for a bit longer then.

2970
03:12:22,740 --> 03:12:24,740
Do you know where you going?

2971
03:12:24,740 --> 03:12:25,740
No.

2972
03:12:25,740 --> 03:12:27,740
It must be fun traveling.

2973
03:12:27,740 --> 03:12:30,740
Yes most of the time.

2974
03:12:30,740 --> 03:12:33,740
It's the best way of meeting new people and still being on your own.

2975
03:12:33,740 --> 03:12:39,740
I wish we could do that, but even when we hibernate and go to sleep, we're never really alone.

2976
03:12:39,740 --> 03:12:42,740
I guess I'd hibernate too if I had to stay up here in Moomin.

2977
03:12:42,740 --> 03:12:45,740
During all the freezing winter snows.

2978
03:12:50,740 --> 03:12:54,740
Do you think I could go south with Snuffkin, Papa?

2979
03:12:57,740 --> 03:13:01,740
Not really, it's the moment way to hibernate.

2980
03:13:01,740 --> 03:13:06,740
It's a family custom passed down through the years by our ancestors.

2981
03:13:06,740 --> 03:13:09,740
But Papa, I don't want to go to sleep for months on end.

2982
03:13:09,740 --> 03:13:11,740
I want to travel south with Snuffkin.

2983
03:13:11,740 --> 03:13:13,740
Oh Moomin.

2984
03:13:13,740 --> 03:13:16,740
You promise you'll be back on the first day of spring.

2985
03:13:16,740 --> 03:13:17,740
Oh Mama.

2986
03:13:17,740 --> 03:13:20,740
Does that mean I can really go?

2987
03:13:20,740 --> 03:13:22,740
I can't wait to tell Snuffkin.

2988
03:13:22,740 --> 03:13:24,740
I can, can't I?

2989
03:13:24,740 --> 03:13:27,740
Well if you really want to, I don't suppose we'll stop you.

2990
03:13:27,740 --> 03:13:29,740
Will we Papa?

2991
03:13:29,740 --> 03:13:35,740
Now my parents didn't mind when I traveled around in my youth, so yes or right Moomin.

2992
03:13:35,740 --> 03:13:39,740
Oh thank you Mama, thank you Mama.

2993
03:13:39,740 --> 03:13:43,740
That's great, but what will Snuffkin say?

2994
03:13:49,740 --> 03:13:54,740
Well, it's a good idea, and I gotta say it'd be fun to have you a long Moomin.

2995
03:13:54,740 --> 03:13:57,740
So I can come with you Snuffkin?

2996
03:13:58,740 --> 03:13:59,740
No.

2997
03:13:59,740 --> 03:14:00,740
What?

2998
03:14:00,740 --> 03:14:03,740
I'm sorry, but I've got to go on my own.

2999
03:14:03,740 --> 03:14:06,740
Don't be disappointed Moomin, I told you I travel alone.

3000
03:14:06,740 --> 03:14:07,740
I need to.

3001
03:14:07,740 --> 03:14:12,740
After spending the rest of the year here, just as I need to be here, after spending the winter alone.

3002
03:14:12,740 --> 03:14:15,740
And the joy of returning to Moomin Valley is something I wouldn't miss.

3003
03:14:15,740 --> 03:14:17,740
Which Snuffkin, I thought.

3004
03:14:17,740 --> 03:14:21,740
The time will soon pass, and you'll be asleep through most of it.

3005
03:14:21,740 --> 03:14:23,740
You won't notice I'm not here.

3006
03:14:23,740 --> 03:14:26,740
I'll see you next spring, Moomin.

3007
03:14:26,740 --> 03:14:31,740
I'll be back on the first day as usual, I promise, as soon as the weather warns.

3008
03:14:31,740 --> 03:14:35,740
And when the flowers start to grow, nothing will keep me from Moomin Valley.

3009
03:14:36,740 --> 03:14:40,740
I'll be back on the first day.

3010
03:14:40,740 --> 03:14:44,740
I'm sorry, I didn't work out for you, Moomin.

3011
03:14:44,740 --> 03:14:47,740
Oh, it's all right.

3012
03:14:47,740 --> 03:14:52,740
Oh, come on Moomin, you'll have to tie them a bit tighter than that.

3013
03:14:52,740 --> 03:14:56,740
I'm sorry I didn't work out for you, Moomin.

3014
03:14:56,740 --> 03:14:58,740
Oh, it's all right.

3015
03:14:58,740 --> 03:15:04,740
Oh, come on, Mum, and you'll have to tie them a bit tighter than that.

3016
03:15:07,740 --> 03:15:12,740
It'll be a cold winter, so we'll need lots of wood to keep us going till spring comes.

3017
03:15:12,740 --> 03:15:13,740
I know.

3018
03:15:13,740 --> 03:15:16,740
Now you want to stay warm, don't you?

3019
03:15:16,740 --> 03:15:19,740
When I grow up, I'll go south for my own, too.

3020
03:15:19,740 --> 03:15:22,740
Yes, of course you will.

3021
03:15:28,740 --> 03:15:32,740
It's Mum and home.

3022
03:15:32,740 --> 03:15:34,740
Yes.

3023
03:15:34,740 --> 03:15:37,740
How is he? Is he still down in the dumps?

3024
03:15:37,740 --> 03:15:41,740
I'm afraid so, grandma's cheer you up recipe didn't work.

3025
03:15:41,740 --> 03:15:45,740
I think he's being silly just because Snuffkin's going away.

3026
03:15:45,740 --> 03:15:47,740
I suppose he is.

3027
03:15:47,740 --> 03:15:49,740
But don't worry, Mama.

3028
03:15:49,740 --> 03:15:54,740
He won't be miserable much longer because I got a surprise for him.

3029
03:16:20,740 --> 03:16:22,740
Are you there, Mum?

3030
03:16:22,740 --> 03:16:24,740
Oh, Mum, and don't cry.

3031
03:16:24,740 --> 03:16:26,740
Boys don't cry, I suppose.

3032
03:16:26,740 --> 03:16:27,740
Of course they do.

3033
03:16:27,740 --> 03:16:29,740
Well, I'm not crying, so they're...

3034
03:16:29,740 --> 03:16:32,740
All right, but I do think you should get up now.

3035
03:16:32,740 --> 03:16:34,740
Oh, and why should I?

3036
03:16:34,740 --> 03:16:36,740
I have a surprise for you.

3037
03:16:36,740 --> 03:16:37,740
I don't want any surprises.

3038
03:16:37,740 --> 03:16:40,740
Come on, I'm going to go and see Snuffkin his workshop.

3039
03:16:40,740 --> 03:16:44,740
But you know he won't let us in. I've tried before.

3040
03:16:44,740 --> 03:16:46,740
Oh, yes. He will today.

3041
03:16:46,740 --> 03:16:48,740
I promise.

3042
03:16:48,740 --> 03:16:51,740
What? You mean Snorkel shows his flying ship at last?

3043
03:16:51,740 --> 03:16:53,740
Yes, he said.

3044
03:16:53,740 --> 03:16:55,740
Has he really finished it then?

3045
03:16:55,740 --> 03:16:58,740
No, not yet. There's still a lot of work to do on it.

3046
03:16:58,740 --> 03:17:00,740
Then I wonder why he's letting us see it.

3047
03:17:00,740 --> 03:17:02,740
He's always refused before.

3048
03:17:02,740 --> 03:17:04,740
What's made him change his mind?

3049
03:17:04,740 --> 03:17:06,740
But I asked him this time.

3050
03:17:06,740 --> 03:17:09,740
I said I wanted to show it to you. It just needed a woman's touch.

3051
03:17:09,740 --> 03:17:11,740
What did you say to him?

3052
03:17:11,740 --> 03:17:13,740
First, he said absolutely not.

3053
03:17:13,740 --> 03:17:17,740
But when I told him how ill you were and that you probably wouldn't be with us much longer,

3054
03:17:17,740 --> 03:17:19,740
he gave in and said we could see it.

3055
03:17:19,740 --> 03:17:20,740
Just you and me of course.

3056
03:17:20,740 --> 03:17:22,740
I'm not that ill Snorkel maiden.

3057
03:17:22,740 --> 03:17:23,740
Oh good.

3058
03:17:23,740 --> 03:17:26,740
Because sometimes when people are very depressed and just lying bad,

3059
03:17:26,740 --> 03:17:28,740
they've done something bad.

3060
03:17:28,740 --> 03:17:31,740
Oh stop it Snorkel maiden. Don't say things like that.

3061
03:17:34,740 --> 03:17:36,740
I'm only trying to cheer you up.

3062
03:17:36,740 --> 03:17:38,740
So remember, don't tell us all.

3063
03:17:38,740 --> 03:17:41,740
No one else must know anything about it.

3064
03:17:41,740 --> 03:17:42,740
Okay.

3065
03:17:48,740 --> 03:17:50,740
Let's go.

3066
03:18:03,740 --> 03:18:04,740
No.

3067
03:18:07,740 --> 03:18:08,740
A little my.

3068
03:18:08,740 --> 03:18:09,740
Little my.

3069
03:18:09,740 --> 03:18:10,740
Trouble.

3070
03:18:10,740 --> 03:18:11,740
Big Trouble.

3071
03:18:11,740 --> 03:18:12,740
We must fool her.

3072
03:18:12,740 --> 03:18:13,740
Yes, but how?

3073
03:18:13,740 --> 03:18:14,740
What can we do?

3074
03:18:15,740 --> 03:18:16,740
I know what we'll do.

3075
03:18:17,740 --> 03:18:18,740
What?

3076
03:18:18,740 --> 03:18:19,740
Quick, Moonman.

3077
03:18:19,740 --> 03:18:21,740
You just agree with everything I say Snorkel maiden.

3078
03:18:21,740 --> 03:18:22,740
Oh.

3079
03:18:23,740 --> 03:18:25,740
I thought you were in bad Moonman.

3080
03:18:25,740 --> 03:18:27,740
No, we're going to see Snorkel.

3081
03:18:27,740 --> 03:18:28,740
Yes.

3082
03:18:28,740 --> 03:18:29,740
Really?

3083
03:18:29,740 --> 03:18:31,740
Yes, he needs to clear a runway for when the flying ship is finished.

3084
03:18:31,740 --> 03:18:33,740
We're going to help him do it, that's all.

3085
03:18:33,740 --> 03:18:34,740
Yes.

3086
03:18:34,740 --> 03:18:35,740
Are you really, Moonman?

3087
03:18:35,740 --> 03:18:37,740
You got out of bad to do that.

3088
03:18:37,740 --> 03:18:44,740
I'm afraid I find it very strange that Snorkel's asked to go along and help him cut down bushes and dig up roots and things.

3089
03:18:44,740 --> 03:18:46,740
You might have noticed I'm not a complete fool.

3090
03:18:46,740 --> 03:18:47,740
But it's true, little my.

3091
03:18:47,740 --> 03:18:48,740
Oh, yes.

3092
03:18:48,740 --> 03:18:50,740
Well, at least you could have invented a better lie.

3093
03:18:50,740 --> 03:18:55,740
You must think I'm pretty stupid to believe a pathetic story like that.

3094
03:18:55,740 --> 03:18:56,740
But it's the truth.

3095
03:18:56,740 --> 03:18:58,740
And we need your help.

3096
03:18:58,740 --> 03:18:59,740
Yeah.

3097
03:18:59,740 --> 03:19:00,740
Don't bother, don't bother.

3098
03:19:00,740 --> 03:19:01,740
I don't want to hear anymore.

3099
03:19:01,740 --> 03:19:04,740
I think it's very sad that you have to pretend.

3100
03:19:04,740 --> 03:19:09,740
You're trying to hide something from me and I'm not interested in what sort of sneaky underhanded thing it is.

3101
03:19:09,740 --> 03:19:10,740
But little my.

3102
03:19:10,740 --> 03:19:11,740
No buts.

3103
03:19:11,740 --> 03:19:15,740
And anyway, I'm a little too busy at the moment to take any notice of what's going on.

3104
03:19:15,740 --> 03:19:16,740
Goodbye.

3105
03:19:19,740 --> 03:19:20,740
Come on.

3106
03:19:21,740 --> 03:19:22,740
Phew, that was close.

3107
03:19:22,740 --> 03:19:23,740
Yeah.

3108
03:19:30,740 --> 03:19:31,740
Ha!

3109
03:19:31,740 --> 03:19:32,740
Think, thank you.

3110
03:19:32,740 --> 03:19:33,740
Keep a secret from me, do they?

3111
03:19:42,740 --> 03:19:44,740
Are you alone?

3112
03:19:44,740 --> 03:19:45,740
Of course we are.

3113
03:19:45,740 --> 03:19:47,740
I promised, didn't I?

3114
03:19:48,740 --> 03:19:49,740
Come in then.

3115
03:19:57,740 --> 03:19:58,740
Wow.

3116
03:20:05,740 --> 03:20:07,740
It's nearly ready, isn't it?

3117
03:20:07,740 --> 03:20:09,740
Oh no, there's a lot more to do.

3118
03:20:09,740 --> 03:20:11,740
The machine isn't half finished yet.

3119
03:20:11,740 --> 03:20:16,740
And as you can see, there's a lot to do on the ship itself, but I'm getting there slowly.

3120
03:20:18,740 --> 03:20:21,740
I never thought it would be so fantastic, smork.

3121
03:20:22,740 --> 03:20:26,740
Well, I suppose you could say the design wasn't a complete failure.

3122
03:20:27,740 --> 03:20:30,740
I'm quite sure it'll fly beautifully.

3123
03:20:30,740 --> 03:20:31,740
Oh, thank you.

3124
03:20:31,740 --> 03:20:33,740
Do you really think it will, woman?

3125
03:20:34,740 --> 03:20:35,740
I can see it now.

3126
03:20:35,740 --> 03:20:39,740
High up in the air, dodging in and out of the clouds, way up above the world.

3127
03:20:41,740 --> 03:20:44,740
Well, I'm glad to see that you're so perceptive and quite right.

3128
03:20:44,740 --> 03:20:46,740
Oh, how very thoughtful of me.

3129
03:20:46,740 --> 03:20:48,740
Shouldn't you sit down and rest.

3130
03:20:48,740 --> 03:20:49,740
You know, you're illness.

3131
03:20:49,740 --> 03:20:51,740
It doesn't help to get too excited.

3132
03:20:52,740 --> 03:20:53,740
Ha, I shouldn't worry, smork.

3133
03:20:53,740 --> 03:20:55,740
There's nothing wrong with him.

3134
03:20:57,740 --> 03:20:59,740
Oh, little my, how did you get in here?

3135
03:21:00,740 --> 03:21:01,740
Throw that door.

3136
03:21:01,740 --> 03:21:03,740
But I always keep it.

3137
03:21:03,740 --> 03:21:05,740
Oh, oh, oh, no.

3138
03:21:06,740 --> 03:21:08,740
I must have forgotten to lock it.

3139
03:21:09,740 --> 03:21:11,740
And it's a bit late to do it now, isn't it?

3140
03:21:11,740 --> 03:21:15,740
But don't worry, if I wanted to get in, I'd get in locks or no locks.

3141
03:21:15,740 --> 03:21:17,740
Oh, you lied to us, little my.

3142
03:21:17,740 --> 03:21:20,740
Of course, but so did you, telling me that stupid story.

3143
03:21:20,740 --> 03:21:22,740
Now we're even, right?

3144
03:21:22,740 --> 03:21:24,740
Now, listen, little my.

3145
03:21:24,740 --> 03:21:27,740
Don't ever tell anybody what you see over here.

3146
03:21:27,740 --> 03:21:28,740
All right.

3147
03:21:31,740 --> 03:21:34,740
This invention contains so many outstanding new features

3148
03:21:34,740 --> 03:21:36,740
it is difficult to know where to begin.

3149
03:21:38,740 --> 03:21:42,740
But let me start with the most exciting part of the whole construction.

3150
03:21:47,740 --> 03:21:52,740
It began as a dream or rather the concept of a dream

3151
03:21:52,740 --> 03:21:57,740
thrilling, beautiful, impossible, dangerous.

3152
03:22:09,740 --> 03:22:10,740
Oh.

3153
03:22:23,740 --> 03:22:25,740
Can you take the ship down, movement?

3154
03:22:25,740 --> 03:22:27,740
I'd like you to land at that side of the lake.

3155
03:22:27,740 --> 03:22:29,740
Oh, why do you want to get off?

3156
03:22:29,740 --> 03:22:32,740
Aren't you having fun flying about up here?

3157
03:22:33,740 --> 03:22:35,740
I want to be on my own.

3158
03:22:35,740 --> 03:22:37,740
Oh, please stay here.

3159
03:22:37,740 --> 03:22:38,740
If you want.

3160
03:22:38,740 --> 03:22:40,740
No, really, movement, please.

3161
03:22:40,740 --> 03:22:42,740
Bye now.

3162
03:22:42,740 --> 03:22:43,740
No!

3163
03:22:47,740 --> 03:22:49,740
Snuff me!

3164
03:22:53,740 --> 03:22:54,740
Ugh.

3165
03:22:54,740 --> 03:22:57,740
Oh, oh.

3166
03:23:08,740 --> 03:23:10,740
So long then, movement, my friend.

3167
03:23:10,740 --> 03:23:12,740
I'll see you again next year.

3168
03:23:12,740 --> 03:23:14,740
The first day of spring.

3169
03:23:38,740 --> 03:23:40,740
Goodbye, then, Snuffkin.

3170
03:24:01,740 --> 03:24:03,740
Off for the winter, eh, Snuffkin?

3171
03:24:03,740 --> 03:24:04,740
Yes.

3172
03:24:04,740 --> 03:24:06,740
Goodbye, Mr. Hemilan.

3173
03:24:06,740 --> 03:24:08,740
We'll be seeing you in the spring.

3174
03:24:08,740 --> 03:24:11,740
Yes, when the snows are gone.

3175
03:24:17,740 --> 03:24:21,740
Oh, to be young and follow the sun wherever it goes.

3176
03:24:21,740 --> 03:24:22,740
Oh.

3177
03:24:34,740 --> 03:24:38,740
And so the snow fell and winter came to movement valley.

3178
03:24:38,740 --> 03:24:43,740
And in movement's hearts, Snuffkin and the spring seemed a long, long way away.

3179
03:24:44,740 --> 03:24:53,740
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

3180
03:24:53,740 --> 03:25:00,740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

3181
03:25:00,740 --> 03:25:04,740
They're always happy and always at play.

3182
03:25:04,740 --> 03:25:11,740
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

3183
03:25:11,740 --> 03:25:18,740
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

3184
03:25:18,740 --> 03:25:26,740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

3185
03:25:26,740 --> 03:25:31,740
They're always happy and always at play.

3186
03:25:31,740 --> 03:25:37,740
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

3187
03:25:37,740 --> 03:25:44,740
The movements, the movements.

3188
03:25:44,740 --> 03:25:51,740
The movements.

3189
03:26:08,740 --> 03:26:12,740
Here they are for one and all.

3190
03:26:12,740 --> 03:26:15,740
The movements are about to come.

3191
03:26:15,740 --> 03:26:18,740
Come on and sit down here with me.

3192
03:26:18,740 --> 03:26:20,740
They're here for you on your TV.

3193
03:26:20,740 --> 03:26:23,740
They are the movements.

3194
03:26:23,740 --> 03:26:26,740
They are the movements.

3195
03:26:26,740 --> 03:26:29,740
So come with me, give me your hand.

3196
03:26:29,740 --> 03:26:32,740
I'll take you up to a movement land.

3197
03:26:32,740 --> 03:26:35,740
You can fly just like a bird.

3198
03:26:36,740 --> 03:26:38,740
Sing that song ever.

3199
03:26:38,740 --> 03:26:41,740
There were the movements.

3200
03:26:41,740 --> 03:26:44,740
There were the movements.

3201
03:26:44,740 --> 03:26:47,740
There were the movements.

3202
03:26:47,740 --> 03:26:50,740
There were the movements.

3203
03:26:50,740 --> 03:26:53,740
There were the movements.

3204
03:26:53,740 --> 03:26:56,740
There were the movements.

3205
03:27:05,740 --> 03:27:08,740
There were the movements.

3206
03:27:08,740 --> 03:27:11,740
There were the movements.

3207
03:27:11,740 --> 03:27:14,740
There were the movements.

3208
03:27:14,740 --> 03:27:17,740
There were the movements.

3209
03:27:17,740 --> 03:27:19,740
There were the movements.

3210
03:27:19,740 --> 03:27:22,740
There were the movements.

3211
03:27:22,740 --> 03:27:25,740
There were the movements.

3212
03:27:25,740 --> 03:27:29,740
There were the movements.

3213
03:27:36,740 --> 03:27:41,740
It's the middle of winter in Moomin Valley.

3214
03:27:41,740 --> 03:27:44,740
And all is quiet and peaceful in Moomin House.

3215
03:27:44,740 --> 03:27:47,740
Is everybody enjoys their winter slumber.

3216
03:27:47,740 --> 03:27:50,740
The house is full of dust covers.

3217
03:27:50,740 --> 03:27:53,740
On the chandelier, on the furniture, on everything.

3218
03:27:53,740 --> 03:27:57,740
Waiting until they all wake up again on the first day of spring.

3219
03:27:57,740 --> 03:28:02,740
And start to get everything in Moomin House clean and ready for the coming summer.

3220
03:28:02,740 --> 03:28:05,740
But what's this?

3221
03:28:05,740 --> 03:28:09,740
It looks like Moomin is restless as if something has disturbed him.

3222
03:28:09,740 --> 03:28:12,740
I wonder what he was dreaming about.

3223
03:28:15,740 --> 03:28:18,740
I wonder what he was dreaming about.

3224
03:28:18,740 --> 03:28:21,740
I wonder what he was dreaming about.

3225
03:28:25,740 --> 03:28:29,740
I wonder what he was dreaming about.

3226
03:28:29,740 --> 03:28:36,740
I wonder what time it is.

3227
03:28:36,740 --> 03:28:40,740
Oh, it's nearly 20 after two.

3228
03:28:40,740 --> 03:28:43,740
Wonder whether it's morning or afternoon.

3229
03:28:43,740 --> 03:28:46,740
It doesn't really matter, I suppose.

3230
03:28:46,740 --> 03:28:52,740
Oh, it's stopped.

3231
03:28:52,740 --> 03:28:55,740
Oh, it's frozen.

3232
03:28:55,740 --> 03:29:02,740
It looks really dark out there.

3233
03:29:12,740 --> 03:29:19,740
Mama, Mama, please wake up.

3234
03:29:20,740 --> 03:29:22,740
Papa, Papa.

3235
03:29:22,740 --> 03:29:24,740
Mama, Mama.

3236
03:29:24,740 --> 03:29:26,740
Mama, what's wrong with me?

3237
03:29:26,740 --> 03:29:29,740
I feel way too weak.

3238
03:29:29,740 --> 03:29:36,740
Oh.

3239
03:29:46,740 --> 03:29:47,740
It's very odd.

3240
03:29:47,740 --> 03:29:52,740
I don't usually wake up when I'm hibernating.

3241
03:29:53,740 --> 03:29:59,740
Oh, dear.

3242
03:29:59,740 --> 03:30:06,740
The whole house is buried in snow.

3243
03:30:06,740 --> 03:30:13,740
Oh.

3244
03:30:13,740 --> 03:30:20,740
Oh.

3245
03:30:21,740 --> 03:30:27,740
Oh.

3246
03:30:27,740 --> 03:30:34,740
Oh.

3247
03:30:34,740 --> 03:30:39,740
Oh.

3248
03:30:39,740 --> 03:30:46,740
Oh.

3249
03:30:46,740 --> 03:30:53,740
Oh.

3250
03:30:53,740 --> 03:31:00,740
Oh.

3251
03:31:00,740 --> 03:31:05,740
This doesn't look like Moomin Valley.

3252
03:31:05,740 --> 03:31:14,740
And it's so quiet.

3253
03:31:14,740 --> 03:31:16,740
What was that?

3254
03:31:16,740 --> 03:31:19,740
Perhaps I better go home.

3255
03:31:19,740 --> 03:31:20,740
No.

3256
03:31:20,740 --> 03:31:21,740
What's the matter with me?

3257
03:31:21,740 --> 03:31:24,740
Everyone's asleep and the furniture's all covered up.

3258
03:31:24,740 --> 03:31:31,740
And Moomin's don't give up.

3259
03:31:39,740 --> 03:31:41,740
I wish enough can we're here.

3260
03:31:42,740 --> 03:31:48,740
He's probably in the far south where it's warm and sunny.

3261
03:31:48,740 --> 03:31:55,740
I wonder what that is.

3262
03:32:19,740 --> 03:32:25,740
Oh.

3263
03:32:25,740 --> 03:32:28,740
Oh.

3264
03:32:28,740 --> 03:32:30,740
Oh.

3265
03:32:30,740 --> 03:32:35,740
That sounds like...

3266
03:32:35,740 --> 03:32:40,740
Oh, he has his little mind.

3267
03:32:40,740 --> 03:32:43,740
By the bobo, what are you doing here, Moomin?

3268
03:32:43,740 --> 03:32:45,740
What am I doing here?

3269
03:32:45,740 --> 03:32:48,740
I heard strange noises and came to see what it was.

3270
03:32:48,740 --> 03:32:50,740
Then you crashed into me like an avalanche.

3271
03:32:50,740 --> 03:32:52,740
And I've just lifted the box off you.

3272
03:32:52,740 --> 03:32:54,740
Oh, don't be stupid, Moomin.

3273
03:32:54,740 --> 03:32:57,740
I mean, why are you out in the snow and not hibernating like the others?

3274
03:32:57,740 --> 03:32:59,740
Spring's not for ages.

3275
03:32:59,740 --> 03:33:00,740
Oh, I don't know.

3276
03:33:00,740 --> 03:33:03,740
I just woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.

3277
03:33:03,740 --> 03:33:05,740
But what about you sliding about like that?

3278
03:33:05,740 --> 03:33:07,740
You should be asleep too.

3279
03:33:07,740 --> 03:33:09,740
Yes, I should, but I just woke up as well.

3280
03:33:09,740 --> 03:33:10,740
Probably to look after you.

3281
03:33:10,740 --> 03:33:14,740
I tried to wake my stupid sister, but she kept on snoring.

3282
03:33:14,740 --> 03:33:16,740
I think this snow is really great.

3283
03:33:16,740 --> 03:33:17,740
Well, I don't.

3284
03:33:17,740 --> 03:33:22,740
It's cold, it's slippy, much too bright, and it's everywhere and far too quiet.

3285
03:33:22,740 --> 03:33:24,740
I saw the grog.

3286
03:33:24,740 --> 03:33:25,740
Wow.

3287
03:33:25,740 --> 03:33:28,740
That horrible freezing monster.

3288
03:33:28,740 --> 03:33:32,740
She should feel at home in this, and there's no point in her trying to freeze anything.

3289
03:33:32,740 --> 03:33:34,740
I saw her on the hill.

3290
03:33:34,740 --> 03:33:36,740
Then it was her voice, I heard.

3291
03:33:36,740 --> 03:33:41,740
Yes, and the trouble with the horrid thing is that she's so cold I wouldn't even want to touch her, Moomin.

3292
03:33:41,740 --> 03:33:42,740
Huh?

3293
03:33:42,740 --> 03:33:43,740
It's her!

3294
03:33:43,740 --> 03:33:44,740
Oh.

3295
03:33:44,740 --> 03:33:54,740
I'm getting cold shivers all over.

3296
03:33:54,740 --> 03:33:56,740
Well, why don't you expect in the snow?

3297
03:33:56,740 --> 03:33:58,740
No, it's the grog's fault.

3298
03:33:58,740 --> 03:33:59,740
She's done it.

3299
03:33:59,740 --> 03:34:01,740
Look at my skin, it's all goose bumpy.

3300
03:34:01,740 --> 03:34:05,740
It's not like that in the summer, it's smooth, not lumpy.

3301
03:34:05,740 --> 03:34:09,740
It's not the snow that makes me feel so cold, it's her staring at me.

3302
03:34:09,740 --> 03:34:18,740
I'm scared.

3303
03:34:18,740 --> 03:34:19,740
That was great.

3304
03:34:19,740 --> 03:34:20,740
Good, isn't it?

3305
03:34:20,740 --> 03:34:22,740
You can have as much as you like.

3306
03:34:22,740 --> 03:34:24,740
We picked more raspberries than ever this year.

3307
03:34:24,740 --> 03:34:26,740
The Mama made lots of juice.

3308
03:34:26,740 --> 03:34:27,740
Thanks.

3309
03:34:27,740 --> 03:34:29,740
Oh.

3310
03:34:29,740 --> 03:34:30,740
Huh.

3311
03:34:30,740 --> 03:34:33,740
I want that.

3312
03:34:33,740 --> 03:34:35,740
Mama's silver tray?

3313
03:34:35,740 --> 03:34:36,740
Yeah.

3314
03:34:36,740 --> 03:34:37,740
What do you want it for?

3315
03:34:37,740 --> 03:34:40,740
To slide on the snow with a coarse stupid?

3316
03:34:40,740 --> 03:34:42,740
But it's a sort of family treasure in heirloom.

3317
03:34:42,740 --> 03:34:45,740
Well, you never use it and it's so shiny.

3318
03:34:45,740 --> 03:34:55,740
It'll make a great sled and go really fast.

3319
03:34:55,740 --> 03:34:57,740
Doesn't look like they'll wake up till spring.

3320
03:34:57,740 --> 03:34:59,740
They're lucky, they're still sleeping.

3321
03:34:59,740 --> 03:35:05,740
I think it's very unfair that I woke up like this.

3322
03:35:05,740 --> 03:35:07,740
So, what should we do now?

3323
03:35:07,740 --> 03:35:09,740
I want to go look at the sea.

3324
03:35:09,740 --> 03:35:10,740
Good idea.

3325
03:35:10,740 --> 03:35:13,740
At least that won't be covered in snow.

3326
03:35:25,740 --> 03:35:29,740
I bet the great cold was just like this.

3327
03:35:32,740 --> 03:35:33,740
Oh no!

3328
03:35:33,740 --> 03:35:34,740
What's the matter?

3329
03:35:34,740 --> 03:35:35,740
I forgot the tray.

3330
03:35:35,740 --> 03:35:36,740
Never mind.

3331
03:35:36,740 --> 03:35:38,740
You can use it as a boat anyway.

3332
03:35:38,740 --> 03:35:39,740
It would sink.

3333
03:35:39,740 --> 03:35:40,740
Yes, you could.

3334
03:35:40,740 --> 03:35:41,740
What?

3335
03:35:41,740 --> 03:35:42,740
How?

3336
03:35:42,740 --> 03:35:43,740
Oh look!

3337
03:35:43,740 --> 03:35:44,740
There's the sink!

3338
03:35:50,740 --> 03:35:52,740
But it's all frozen.

3339
03:35:52,740 --> 03:35:54,740
So we'll be able to slide on it.

3340
03:35:55,740 --> 03:35:57,740
What's that over there?

3341
03:36:05,740 --> 03:36:06,740
Huh?

3342
03:36:25,740 --> 03:36:26,740
Huh?

3343
03:36:26,740 --> 03:36:28,740
Tootiki!

3344
03:36:28,740 --> 03:36:30,740
Hello, you too.

3345
03:36:31,740 --> 03:36:33,740
You're not hibernating either?

3346
03:36:33,740 --> 03:36:35,740
Oh no.

3347
03:36:35,740 --> 03:36:37,740
I haven't got time to spend four months sleeping.

3348
03:36:37,740 --> 03:36:38,740
Why not?

3349
03:36:38,740 --> 03:36:41,740
Little Mayan, I just woke up and now we don't know what to do.

3350
03:36:41,740 --> 03:36:43,740
I'm sure you can think of something.

3351
03:36:43,740 --> 03:36:44,740
Who's supposed to?

3352
03:36:44,740 --> 03:36:47,740
I've never seen the sea frozen before.

3353
03:36:47,740 --> 03:36:49,740
Did you make that horse tootiki?

3354
03:36:49,740 --> 03:36:50,740
Yes, I did.

3355
03:36:50,740 --> 03:36:51,740
Can I sit on it?

3356
03:36:51,740 --> 03:36:52,740
No, you can't.

3357
03:36:52,740 --> 03:36:54,740
I need it for the lady of the cold.

3358
03:36:54,740 --> 03:36:56,740
Oh, I see.

3359
03:36:56,740 --> 03:36:58,740
I suppose you've heard of her.

3360
03:36:58,740 --> 03:37:00,740
Yes, she's very beautiful,

3361
03:37:00,740 --> 03:37:01,740
but if she looks into your eyes,

3362
03:37:01,740 --> 03:37:02,740
you're turned into a block of ice.

3363
03:37:02,740 --> 03:37:04,740
She's not a very nice lady.

3364
03:37:04,740 --> 03:37:05,740
That's right, Little Mayan.

3365
03:37:05,740 --> 03:37:07,740
Spring can never come while she's here.

3366
03:37:07,740 --> 03:37:09,740
It waits for her to go.

3367
03:37:09,740 --> 03:37:10,740
Oh, I see.

3368
03:37:10,740 --> 03:37:13,740
And are you hoping she'll ride away on this horse then?

3369
03:37:14,740 --> 03:37:16,740
Yes, and it will take her back to the north,

3370
03:37:16,740 --> 03:37:19,740
where she stays until she comes here again next winter

3371
03:37:19,740 --> 03:37:21,740
and drives the sun away.

3372
03:37:21,740 --> 03:37:24,740
The horse doesn't look very solid to me, Tootiki.

3373
03:37:24,740 --> 03:37:26,740
Well, that's why I'm going to pour water over it

3374
03:37:26,740 --> 03:37:29,740
when it gets really cold, and then it'll be solid.

3375
03:37:30,740 --> 03:37:32,740
When is the lady of the cold coming?

3376
03:37:32,740 --> 03:37:35,740
You can never tell, but soon, tonight, perhaps,

3377
03:37:35,740 --> 03:37:38,740
it feels much colder already.

3378
03:37:39,740 --> 03:37:40,740
My.

3379
03:37:55,740 --> 03:37:57,740
What's happened to the sun, Tootiki?

3380
03:37:57,740 --> 03:37:59,740
Do you know when the sun will come back again?

3381
03:38:00,740 --> 03:38:01,740
Uh-huh.

3382
03:38:01,740 --> 03:38:03,740
It's in the south shining on Snuffkin,

3383
03:38:03,740 --> 03:38:04,740
but it'll be back soon,

3384
03:38:04,740 --> 03:38:07,740
and then it will stay a bit longer each day.

3385
03:38:07,740 --> 03:38:13,240
Good I can't wait, now there'll be a full moon tonight, and we'll be able to see everything.

3386
03:38:13,240 --> 03:38:16,740
Great, I can get my tray out! I can't wait to try it on the sea!

3387
03:38:16,740 --> 03:38:18,740
What do you mean, your tray?

3388
03:38:18,740 --> 03:38:23,740
Well, let's move in, Mama's tray, but I'm using it. I'm going to put a sail on it and slide across the ice.

3389
03:38:23,740 --> 03:38:25,740
Why not wait till tomorrow?

3390
03:38:25,740 --> 03:38:29,740
Wait until tomorrow? No, when I want to do something, I do it now!

3391
03:38:29,740 --> 03:38:32,740
What if the ice suddenly melts or something?

3392
03:38:33,740 --> 03:38:34,740
Eh!

3393
03:38:35,740 --> 03:38:36,740
Yeah!

3394
03:38:37,740 --> 03:38:42,740
I like it here, it's warm and cozy. I hope Moomin Papa doesn't mind me using it.

3395
03:38:42,740 --> 03:38:48,740
This is Papa's bathhouse. He build it himself, and he'd be very glad to know you're using it.

3396
03:38:48,740 --> 03:38:51,740
It's great, the window paints are different colors.

3397
03:38:51,740 --> 03:38:56,740
If you look out through one, the world is red, and through another one, the world is green.

3398
03:39:02,740 --> 03:39:10,740
Oh, you don't hibernate either, do you?

3399
03:39:10,740 --> 03:39:15,740
Now scram, the horrible lady of the cold is coming and if she looks you in the eye, you'll turn to ice!

3400
03:39:15,740 --> 03:39:17,740
Go on, go away!

3401
03:39:33,740 --> 03:39:35,740
Moomin!

3402
03:39:35,740 --> 03:39:37,740
Tu-tiki!

3403
03:39:37,740 --> 03:39:39,740
Moomin!

3404
03:39:40,740 --> 03:39:41,740
Moomin!

3405
03:39:41,740 --> 03:39:43,740
Tu-tiki, why are you?

3406
03:39:43,740 --> 03:39:45,740
Little Mike, we're over here.

3407
03:39:45,740 --> 03:39:46,740
Huh?

3408
03:39:47,740 --> 03:39:49,740
Why are you doing down there?

3409
03:39:49,740 --> 03:39:52,740
Tu-tiki's trying to catch some fish.

3410
03:39:52,740 --> 03:39:55,740
If she does, she's going to cook us some dinner.

3411
03:39:55,740 --> 03:39:58,740
Right, I've got to get sailing, man.

3412
03:39:58,740 --> 03:40:01,740
I'd better go see what she's doing to Mama Silver tray.

3413
03:40:01,740 --> 03:40:03,740
Okay.

3414
03:40:06,740 --> 03:40:08,740
Ah, got one.

3415
03:40:13,740 --> 03:40:15,740
Oh dear, me.

3416
03:40:18,740 --> 03:40:21,740
She's cold and wet under that ice.

3417
03:40:21,740 --> 03:40:22,740
How are you doing, little Mike?

3418
03:40:22,740 --> 03:40:24,740
Very well, thank you.

3419
03:40:26,740 --> 03:40:28,740
How can you get under the ice anyway?

3420
03:40:28,740 --> 03:40:31,740
I guess the water must be low and there's a gap left there.

3421
03:40:31,740 --> 03:40:32,740
Oh, how?

3422
03:40:32,740 --> 03:40:37,740
I don't know, but perhaps the tide was in when the sea froze and some of it got stuck to the shore.

3423
03:40:37,740 --> 03:40:40,740
Oh, I suppose it's possible.

3424
03:40:40,740 --> 03:40:45,740
Tu-tiki told me that she has fish soup every day in the wintertime.

3425
03:40:48,740 --> 03:40:51,740
I know, I'll go see if the horse is frozen yet.

3426
03:40:51,740 --> 03:40:54,740
Make sure you shut the door behind you.

3427
03:40:54,740 --> 03:40:56,740
Oh, my thumb!

3428
03:40:59,740 --> 03:41:01,740
Hmm, I don't think it's hard enough yet.

3429
03:41:01,740 --> 03:41:04,740
It'll collapse if the lady if the coke gets on it now.

3430
03:41:07,740 --> 03:41:10,740
Oh, it's getting colder and colder.

3431
03:41:11,740 --> 03:41:13,740
Oh, it's getting colder and colder.

3432
03:41:14,740 --> 03:41:16,740
Oh, it's getting colder and colder.

3433
03:41:38,740 --> 03:41:39,740
The grog.

3434
03:41:44,740 --> 03:41:46,740
Don't tell me you want to ride the horse.

3435
03:41:49,740 --> 03:41:51,740
I don't think you'd better.

3436
03:41:52,740 --> 03:41:54,740
This is for the lady of the cold, you know.

3437
03:41:57,740 --> 03:41:59,740
There's no telling what she'd do to you.

3438
03:41:59,740 --> 03:42:01,740
Look you in the eye, probably.

3439
03:42:14,740 --> 03:42:16,740
Even the grog is frightened of the lady of the cold.

3440
03:42:19,740 --> 03:42:21,740
Ah, now it looks frozen.

3441
03:42:25,740 --> 03:42:26,740
Wee!

3442
03:42:28,740 --> 03:42:29,740
Wee!

3443
03:42:37,740 --> 03:42:39,740
Great, isn't it, movement?

3444
03:42:39,740 --> 03:42:41,740
Yeah, that old tree really moves.

3445
03:42:41,740 --> 03:42:42,740
Wanna go?

3446
03:42:42,740 --> 03:42:43,740
No thanks, I'm too big.

3447
03:42:43,740 --> 03:42:44,740
Come on, now.

3448
03:42:44,740 --> 03:42:47,740
The fish soup is ready and it's time you were inside, little my.

3449
03:42:47,740 --> 03:42:49,740
Keep it warm for me, I'm having another go.

3450
03:42:49,740 --> 03:42:51,740
No, little my.

3451
03:42:51,740 --> 03:42:52,740
Why not?

3452
03:42:52,740 --> 03:42:56,740
Have you forgotten what I told you the lady of the cold may be coming?

3453
03:42:56,740 --> 03:42:57,740
Oh.

3454
03:42:57,740 --> 03:42:59,740
Well, I want to see her.

3455
03:42:59,740 --> 03:43:00,740
I'm not scared of her.

3456
03:43:00,740 --> 03:43:02,740
I'll be moving so fast she won't get a chance.

3457
03:43:02,740 --> 03:43:05,740
No, now listen to me, little my.

3458
03:43:05,740 --> 03:43:08,740
All you have to do is not let her look you in the eye.

3459
03:43:08,740 --> 03:43:11,740
But what happens if you're not quick enough and she catches you before you turn away?

3460
03:43:12,740 --> 03:43:16,740
I know, if we watch her from the bathhouse, she won't see us.

3461
03:43:20,740 --> 03:43:21,740
Please, little my.

3462
03:43:21,740 --> 03:43:23,740
Come in, she's almost here.

3463
03:43:23,740 --> 03:43:25,740
We can watch it from inside.

3464
03:43:29,740 --> 03:43:30,740
That's no good.

3465
03:43:30,740 --> 03:43:31,740
I want to see her properly.

3466
03:43:31,740 --> 03:43:32,740
No, little my.

3467
03:43:32,740 --> 03:43:33,740
No, little my.

3468
03:43:33,740 --> 03:43:34,740
Don't go.

3469
03:43:36,740 --> 03:43:37,740
No!

3470
03:43:39,740 --> 03:43:40,740
Come back.

3471
03:43:40,740 --> 03:43:41,740
Little my.

3472
03:43:44,740 --> 03:43:45,740
Oh dear.

3473
03:43:45,740 --> 03:43:48,740
Come on, let's get back in the cabin before it's too late.

3474
03:43:48,740 --> 03:43:49,740
Wee!

3475
03:44:03,740 --> 03:44:05,740
Oh, the lady of the cold.

3476
03:44:06,740 --> 03:44:08,740
Come on.

3477
03:44:32,740 --> 03:44:33,740
I saw her face.

3478
03:44:34,740 --> 03:44:35,740
I saw her face.

3479
03:44:35,740 --> 03:44:37,740
I saw her and she didn't turn away to eye.

3480
03:44:40,740 --> 03:44:42,740
Press little my to get away with it.

3481
03:44:42,740 --> 03:44:44,740
I don't know how she does it.

3482
03:44:45,740 --> 03:44:47,740
I think her nerves are made of steel.

3483
03:44:47,740 --> 03:44:49,740
I hope she's alright.

3484
03:44:49,740 --> 03:44:52,740
She should try not to make so much noise out there.

3485
03:45:04,740 --> 03:45:05,740
Oh dear.

3486
03:45:10,740 --> 03:45:13,740
Oh dear.

3487
03:45:25,740 --> 03:45:28,740
Oh dear.

3488
03:45:34,740 --> 03:45:36,740
Oh dear.

3489
03:45:40,740 --> 03:45:41,740
Yay!

3490
03:45:41,740 --> 03:45:42,740
I saw her face.

3491
03:45:42,740 --> 03:45:44,740
I saw her face.

3492
03:45:52,740 --> 03:45:54,740
Come on.

3493
03:46:00,740 --> 03:46:02,740
Come on, my friend.

3494
03:46:02,740 --> 03:46:04,740
Oh no, don't stop now.

3495
03:46:04,740 --> 03:46:05,740
No, my friend.

3496
03:46:05,740 --> 03:46:06,740
Oh, this is it.

3497
03:46:09,740 --> 03:46:10,740
Little my.

3498
03:46:20,740 --> 03:46:26,740
Oh dear.

3499
03:46:32,740 --> 03:46:34,740
Oh dear.

3500
03:46:58,740 --> 03:47:00,740
Little my.

3501
03:47:03,740 --> 03:47:05,740
Come on, please.

3502
03:47:08,740 --> 03:47:10,740
Wake up, please.

3503
03:47:14,740 --> 03:47:17,740
Oh please, don't stay frozen, little my.

3504
03:47:17,740 --> 03:47:18,740
Don't worry, little my.

3505
03:47:18,740 --> 03:47:19,740
We'll thought you out.

3506
03:47:19,740 --> 03:47:20,740
Don't worry.

3507
03:47:20,740 --> 03:47:22,740
It's nice and warm here.

3508
03:47:33,740 --> 03:47:35,740
Oh, that's hot, moment.

3509
03:47:35,740 --> 03:47:37,740
Praise the ball, Bob.

3510
03:47:37,740 --> 03:47:39,740
You come back.

3511
03:47:41,740 --> 03:47:45,740
So little my came back from the cold, little the worst for wear.

3512
03:47:45,740 --> 03:47:47,740
Moment need not have worried.

3513
03:47:47,740 --> 03:47:51,740
For the little mysars world are practically indestructible.

3514
03:48:03,740 --> 03:48:10,740
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

3515
03:48:10,740 --> 03:48:17,740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

3516
03:48:17,740 --> 03:48:21,740
They're always happy and always at play.

3517
03:48:21,740 --> 03:48:25,740
The movements are having fun day after day.

3518
03:48:25,740 --> 03:48:28,740
The movements.

3519
03:48:29,740 --> 03:48:32,740
The movements.

3520
03:48:32,740 --> 03:48:39,740
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

3521
03:48:39,740 --> 03:48:47,740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

3522
03:48:47,740 --> 03:48:51,740
They're always happy and always at play.

3523
03:48:51,740 --> 03:48:54,740
The movements are having fun day after day.

3524
03:48:54,740 --> 03:48:58,740
The movements.

3525
03:48:58,740 --> 03:49:01,740
The movements.

3526
03:49:01,740 --> 03:49:08,740
The movements.

3527
03:49:25,740 --> 03:49:30,740
Here they are for one and all.

3528
03:49:30,740 --> 03:49:33,740
The movements are about to come.

3529
03:49:33,740 --> 03:49:36,740
Come on and sit down here with me.

3530
03:49:36,740 --> 03:49:38,740
They're here for you on your TV.

3531
03:49:38,740 --> 03:49:41,740
They are the movements.

3532
03:49:41,740 --> 03:49:44,740
They are the movements.

3533
03:49:44,740 --> 03:49:47,740
So come with me, give me your hand.

3534
03:49:47,740 --> 03:49:50,740
I'll take you up to a movement land.

3535
03:49:50,740 --> 03:49:53,740
You can fly just like a bird.

3536
03:49:53,740 --> 03:49:56,740
You sing the path song ever.

3537
03:49:56,740 --> 03:49:58,740
There were the movements.

3538
03:49:58,740 --> 03:50:01,740
There were the movements.

3539
03:50:01,740 --> 03:50:04,740
They were the movements.

3540
03:50:04,740 --> 03:50:07,740
There were the movements.

3541
03:50:07,740 --> 03:50:10,740
There were the movements.

3542
03:50:10,740 --> 03:50:13,740
They were the movements.

3543
03:50:23,740 --> 03:50:53,740
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

3544
03:50:53,740 --> 03:51:23,740
During the long winter in Moomin Valley, almost everybody living their hibernates until the sunshine comes again in the spring. But for some reason, Moomin and Little Mai woke up in the middle of it and couldn't get back to sleep.

3545
03:51:23,740 --> 03:51:53,740
But for some reason, Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin

3546
03:51:53,740 --> 03:52:09,540
That was fun! Why don't you have a go Moomin? I'm probably a bit heavy for it. So get something else, dummy! I might later... Anyway, I thought we were gonna see Tuttaki. Come on, I'll pull you. Okay!

3547
03:52:14,220 --> 03:52:20,800
I know why you don't wanna go Moomin. You're scared of sliding down from the top, aren't you? No, of course I'm not!

3548
03:52:23,740 --> 03:52:32,740
Don't you think he's not here? I wonder where she's gone to.

3549
03:52:32,740 --> 03:52:35,740
That's her over there, isn't it?

3550
03:52:35,740 --> 03:52:37,740
Oh, yeah, I think it is.

3551
03:52:37,740 --> 03:52:41,740
Jane, move in. She looks like she's sliding.

3552
03:52:41,740 --> 03:52:42,740
Sliding?

3553
03:52:42,740 --> 03:52:45,740
Yes, it's obvious. She's sliding, of course.

3554
03:52:45,740 --> 03:52:49,740
She's coming over.

3555
03:52:49,740 --> 03:52:52,740
What were you doing out there, too, Tiki?

3556
03:52:52,740 --> 03:52:58,740
Stung go down. It's the only place you can see it from. I just caught it for it disappeared over the horizon.

3557
03:52:58,740 --> 03:52:59,740
Where did it go to?

3558
03:52:59,740 --> 03:53:03,740
It comes up again in the south and will probably shine on snuffkin.

3559
03:53:03,740 --> 03:53:06,740
Hey, Tiki, what are those things you got on your feet?

3560
03:53:06,740 --> 03:53:11,740
They're called skates and they're the best thing possible for moving across the ice quickly.

3561
03:53:11,740 --> 03:53:14,740
Just what I need. Come on. Show me how to do it.

3562
03:53:14,740 --> 03:53:18,740
Yes, okay?

3563
03:53:18,740 --> 03:53:22,740
That's great. I'm going to make myself some skates, too.

3564
03:53:22,740 --> 03:53:25,740
It's not as easy as you'd think, little lie.

3565
03:53:25,740 --> 03:53:31,740
Pathetic. All you need is a sword and knife on your shoes and that sounds easy enough to me.

3566
03:53:34,740 --> 03:53:41,740
You know, it's strange, but I've got a funny kind of feeling that there's someone else apart from us in the bathhouse.

3567
03:53:41,740 --> 03:53:42,740
Hmm, well, there it is.

3568
03:53:42,740 --> 03:53:45,740
Who is it? Where are they?

3569
03:53:46,740 --> 03:53:48,740
Little lie, you can't see them.

3570
03:53:48,740 --> 03:53:52,740
Huh, what do you mean I can't see them? Where are they hiding in the cupboard?

3571
03:53:52,740 --> 03:53:56,740
No, they're invisible. Look, I'll show you.

3572
03:54:02,740 --> 03:54:04,740
Oh, oh, there's something on my head.

3573
03:54:04,740 --> 03:54:08,740
See, that's two of the shoe mice. They're eight of them all together.

3574
03:54:08,740 --> 03:54:11,740
Now, don't walk a little lie.

3575
03:54:12,740 --> 03:54:16,740
I didn't see any shoe mice here in the summer.

3576
03:54:16,740 --> 03:54:19,740
Although, if they're invisible, I wouldn't have done.

3577
03:54:19,740 --> 03:54:21,740
No, probably not.

3578
03:54:21,740 --> 03:54:25,740
As in the summer when we come across new little animals that we've never seen before.

3579
03:54:25,740 --> 03:54:29,740
And who likes snuffkin, go away when the wind and snow comes.

3580
03:54:29,740 --> 03:54:34,740
Then when the days are shorter and everyone else is hibernating, they come out.

3581
03:54:34,740 --> 03:54:37,740
And summer's so shy, they're invisible, dear.

3582
03:54:37,740 --> 03:54:40,740
I'm afraid I don't understand winter at all.

3583
03:54:40,740 --> 03:54:45,740
Well, of course you don't. You moments have always slept through and don't know very much about it.

3584
03:54:45,740 --> 03:54:50,740
Oh, I can't wait to tell Mum or Papa about all this. They'll be really amazed.

3585
03:54:56,740 --> 03:54:57,740
Moomin!

3586
03:54:57,740 --> 03:54:58,740
What is it?

3587
03:54:58,740 --> 03:55:01,740
We will wake up tomorrow, won't we, Moomin?

3588
03:55:01,740 --> 03:55:03,740
I'm sure we will. Why?

3589
03:55:03,740 --> 03:55:06,740
I just don't want to go on sleeping and sleeping until spring.

3590
03:55:06,740 --> 03:55:08,740
Well, we woke up today, so...

3591
03:55:08,740 --> 03:55:10,740
But we don't know about tomorrow.

3592
03:55:10,740 --> 03:55:13,740
No, of course not. We'll have to wait and see.

3593
03:55:13,740 --> 03:55:17,740
If we're awake, we'll know. And if we're asleep, then it doesn't matter.

3594
03:55:17,740 --> 03:55:18,740
Hmm.

3595
03:55:18,740 --> 03:55:22,740
Well, if I'm not awake and you are, wake me up, okay, Moomin?

3596
03:55:22,740 --> 03:55:24,740
Yes, all right. Go to sleep now.

3597
03:55:24,740 --> 03:55:26,740
What if it's the other way around, Moomin?

3598
03:55:26,740 --> 03:55:30,740
Well, what if I wake up and you're still fast asleep?

3599
03:55:30,740 --> 03:55:34,740
I don't mind sleeping all winter. Now, stop talking to me, my.

3600
03:55:35,740 --> 03:55:37,740
You'd better wake me up or else.

3601
03:56:01,740 --> 03:56:03,740
Hey, little mine.

3602
03:56:03,740 --> 03:56:05,740
Where have you gone to?

3603
03:56:16,740 --> 03:56:17,740
Hello.

3604
03:56:17,740 --> 03:56:20,740
Well, well. Wonderful place for skiing, you've got here.

3605
03:56:20,740 --> 03:56:23,740
What are those funny things on your feet?

3606
03:56:24,740 --> 03:56:26,740
Hey, what? You're joking.

3607
03:56:26,740 --> 03:56:27,740
Huh?

3608
03:56:27,740 --> 03:56:29,740
You mean you really don't know what these are?

3609
03:56:29,740 --> 03:56:31,740
That's why I'm asking you.

3610
03:56:31,740 --> 03:56:34,740
Well, they're skis, didn't you see me come down?

3611
03:56:34,740 --> 03:56:38,740
Yes, I did. Can you slide on the ice with these and go just as fast?

3612
03:56:38,740 --> 03:56:41,740
Oh no, on ice, you have to use skates.

3613
03:56:41,740 --> 03:56:43,740
What is that, young lady?

3614
03:56:43,740 --> 03:56:47,740
Oh, it's a snowboard. You slide on the snow with it.

3615
03:56:57,740 --> 03:57:00,740
That's not bad, but it's only your silver tray, isn't it?

3616
03:57:00,740 --> 03:57:01,740
That's right, mister.

3617
03:57:01,740 --> 03:57:02,740
I'll teach you to ski.

3618
03:57:02,740 --> 03:57:04,740
No, thank you. I'll learn by watching you.

3619
03:57:04,740 --> 03:57:06,740
Won't take me long at all.

3620
03:57:06,740 --> 03:57:08,740
I'm afraid skiing is not that easy, young lady.

3621
03:57:08,740 --> 03:57:10,740
Don't worry, it won't be for me.

3622
03:57:10,740 --> 03:57:13,740
Everything is once I decide to do it.

3623
03:57:20,740 --> 03:57:23,740
Oh, so you spend all year going where the snow is?

3624
03:57:23,740 --> 03:57:25,740
That must be tiring.

3625
03:57:25,740 --> 03:57:27,740
Not at all. Life should be a struggle.

3626
03:57:28,740 --> 03:57:30,740
This jam is really good.

3627
03:57:30,740 --> 03:57:34,740
Does it always have to be winter, catch a struggle in spring and summer instead?

3628
03:57:34,740 --> 03:57:36,740
Well, no, that would be too easy.

3629
03:57:36,740 --> 03:57:38,740
You could just sit back and relax.

3630
03:57:38,740 --> 03:57:42,740
No, you've got to face up to the cold and exercise to keep warm.

3631
03:57:42,740 --> 03:57:45,740
That sounds very interesting, Mr. Brisk.

3632
03:57:45,740 --> 03:57:51,740
One clear cold bath a day keeps all those unnecessary thoughts away.

3633
03:57:51,740 --> 03:57:53,740
My own little poem.

3634
03:57:53,740 --> 03:57:56,740
What? You don't mean you swim in this weather, do you?

3635
03:57:56,740 --> 03:57:58,740
The water must be very close to freezing.

3636
03:57:58,740 --> 03:58:02,740
Well, the sea is a lot colder than that. It is frozen.

3637
03:58:02,740 --> 03:58:03,740
Is there a river?

3638
03:58:03,740 --> 03:58:07,740
Yes, there is, but the water looks very, very cold.

3639
03:58:07,740 --> 03:58:09,740
Sounds just right.

3640
03:58:09,740 --> 03:58:14,740
Have you got any more of this wonderful jam? It's delicious.

3641
03:58:14,740 --> 03:58:18,740
There's some more in the cellar, but we've got cranberry up here if you'd like that.

3642
03:58:18,740 --> 03:58:21,740
No, thanks. This will do for now.

3643
03:58:21,740 --> 03:58:24,740
I'd appreciate some after my daily swim.

3644
03:58:24,740 --> 03:58:26,740
It'll work up an appetite.

3645
03:58:32,740 --> 03:58:34,740
This is great.

3646
03:58:36,740 --> 03:58:39,740
I can hardly watch. It makes me shiver all over.

3647
03:58:39,740 --> 03:58:41,740
Is everybody like you where you come from?

3648
03:58:41,740 --> 03:58:44,740
Unfortunately not. Why did you join me?

3649
03:58:44,740 --> 03:58:46,740
No, thank you.

3650
03:58:47,740 --> 03:58:51,740
Hello, what are you two looking at?

3651
03:58:51,740 --> 03:58:52,740
Huh?

3652
03:58:53,740 --> 03:58:58,740
Oh, hello there, little dog. We're watching that madman down there.

3653
03:59:03,740 --> 03:59:05,740
He looks like he's swimming.

3654
03:59:05,740 --> 03:59:07,740
Moving valley is full of very odd people.

3655
03:59:07,740 --> 03:59:10,740
He's not from moving valley as a matter of fact.

3656
03:59:10,740 --> 03:59:12,740
Who are you?

3657
03:59:12,740 --> 03:59:15,740
I'm sorry, and I'm looking for my brothers.

3658
03:59:15,740 --> 03:59:18,740
I don't suppose you've seen them, have you?

3659
03:59:18,740 --> 03:59:20,740
Your brothers, have you lost them?

3660
03:59:20,740 --> 03:59:23,740
Are they hibernating somewhere, do you think?

3661
03:59:23,740 --> 03:59:26,740
Oh, no, not them. They never do that.

3662
03:59:26,740 --> 03:59:31,740
Well, everyone else in moving valley is hibernating, except little Mai here.

3663
03:59:31,740 --> 03:59:36,740
Now, too ticky, and the invisible mice, me, oh, and that crazy person down in the middle.

3664
03:59:37,740 --> 03:59:39,740
Oh, yeah!

3665
03:59:43,740 --> 03:59:47,740
My brothers are up in the lonely mountains. Is that far from here?

3666
03:59:47,740 --> 03:59:49,740
No, not far.

3667
03:59:49,740 --> 03:59:54,740
Lonely mountains. I know there are wolves up there, but I never heard of any dogs.

3668
03:59:54,740 --> 03:59:58,740
Well wolves and dogs are brothers, didn't you know?

3669
03:59:58,740 --> 04:00:06,740
Oh, you know, this tastes even better after an invigorating swim.

3670
04:00:06,740 --> 04:00:09,740
That's my favorite jam, much nicer than cranberry.

3671
04:00:09,740 --> 04:00:12,740
Oh, I agree.

3672
04:00:12,740 --> 04:00:16,740
Ah, doggie, now don't you want your jam?

3673
04:00:16,740 --> 04:00:18,740
What? No, you have it.

3674
04:00:18,740 --> 04:00:20,740
Oh, thank you.

3675
04:00:20,740 --> 04:00:23,740
Oh, you look as though you're a bit worried about something.

3676
04:00:23,740 --> 04:00:25,740
Yes, I suppose I am.

3677
04:00:26,740 --> 04:00:29,740
Put it out of your mind.

3678
04:00:29,740 --> 04:00:34,740
Why do you think your brothers are wolves? Did someone tell you they were?

3679
04:00:34,740 --> 04:00:37,740
Of course they are. Everyone knows that.

3680
04:00:37,740 --> 04:00:39,740
And besides, I can feel the wolf in me.

3681
04:00:39,740 --> 04:00:43,740
Well, you might feel it, but nobody can see it for a star. Wolves are much bigger than you.

3682
04:00:43,740 --> 04:00:48,740
I want to go and find them, and then we can all hell at the moon. I've been practicing.

3683
04:00:48,740 --> 04:00:51,740
I can see why he wants to be a wolf, but we'd better keep him here.

3684
04:00:51,740 --> 04:00:54,740
He could get hurt if he goes up there on his own.

3685
04:00:54,740 --> 04:00:57,740
You don't really want to live with wolves, do you?

3686
04:00:57,740 --> 04:00:59,740
Oh, I do very much.

3687
04:00:59,740 --> 04:01:01,740
Why don't you travel around with me, sorry, you?

3688
04:01:01,740 --> 04:01:04,740
I've got little dogs. They could be your brothers and sisters if you want.

3689
04:01:04,740 --> 04:01:06,740
Well, I don't know.

3690
04:01:06,740 --> 04:01:10,740
Look, I'm going to stay here in Moomin Valley for a while, and we can become great friends.

3691
04:01:10,740 --> 04:01:12,740
You're going to stay here?

3692
04:01:12,740 --> 04:01:18,740
Oh, yes. Marvelous slopes find swimming the most wonderful jam, and I'll build myself an igloo.

3693
04:01:18,740 --> 04:01:20,740
An igloo? You mean a house made of snow?

3694
04:01:20,740 --> 04:01:27,740
Yes, that's it, exactly. If it's all right with you, Moomin, I'll take this jam with me, just to keep me going.

3695
04:01:45,740 --> 04:01:48,740
Hello there. Can I borrow your spade for a minute, Mr. Brisk?

3696
04:01:48,740 --> 04:01:50,740
Of course. What for, my friend?

3697
04:01:50,740 --> 04:01:52,740
I want to break up this barrel.

3698
04:01:52,740 --> 04:01:55,740
Oh, that's easy. Allow me, little mind.

3699
04:01:55,740 --> 04:01:58,740
Here, here, here.

3700
04:01:58,740 --> 04:02:00,740
How's that, young lady?

3701
04:02:05,740 --> 04:02:09,740
Mr. Brisk really loves this jam. He can't stop eating it.

3702
04:02:09,740 --> 04:02:13,740
Well, it's very nice, Moomin. I can't imagine anyone not liking it.

3703
04:02:13,740 --> 04:02:15,740
Do you know how to ski to a tiki?

3704
04:02:15,740 --> 04:02:19,740
Well, of course I do. I just haven't done it yet.

3705
04:02:19,740 --> 04:02:22,740
Mr. Brisk says that he's going to teach me.

3706
04:02:22,740 --> 04:02:23,740
Oh.

3707
04:02:25,740 --> 04:02:28,740
I can't move my legs tied up like this.

3708
04:02:28,740 --> 04:02:32,740
That's the whole point. You don't have to. You just move your skis. Easy as winking.

3709
04:02:38,740 --> 04:02:41,740
First of all, you have to learn how to fall properly.

3710
04:02:41,740 --> 04:02:44,740
Well, then if I learn to ski first, then I won't fall.

3711
04:02:50,740 --> 04:02:52,740
Little mind has skis, too.

3712
04:02:52,740 --> 04:02:54,740
Oh, they're just made from an old barrel.

3713
04:02:54,740 --> 04:02:56,740
Yours are much more sophisticated.

3714
04:02:56,740 --> 04:03:00,740
Now then, Benjamin, ease and lean forward. Are you ready?

3715
04:03:00,740 --> 04:03:03,740
I don't think I like this. It's too steep.

3716
04:03:03,740 --> 04:03:05,740
Can I practice on something a bit flatter?

3717
04:03:05,740 --> 04:03:09,740
Well, maybe next time. Now then, I'll have few rolls.

3718
04:03:09,740 --> 04:03:11,740
Whoa!

3719
04:03:13,740 --> 04:03:14,740
Whoa!

3720
04:03:22,740 --> 04:03:25,740
Trying to start an avalanche movement?

3721
04:03:25,740 --> 04:03:28,740
You know, I think this hill is even steeper than the last one.

3722
04:03:28,740 --> 04:03:31,740
There's nothing to worry about. You've already mastered falling down.

3723
04:03:31,740 --> 04:03:32,740
How if you go again?

3724
04:03:32,740 --> 04:03:34,740
Whoa!

3725
04:03:34,740 --> 04:03:36,740
Whoa!

3726
04:03:36,740 --> 04:03:38,740
Whoa!

3727
04:03:38,740 --> 04:03:40,740
Whoa!

3728
04:03:40,740 --> 04:03:42,740
Whoa!

3729
04:03:42,740 --> 04:03:44,740
Oh, stop it, please!

3730
04:03:44,740 --> 04:03:47,740
You can do it yourself. Just calm down.

3731
04:03:47,740 --> 04:03:49,740
Whoa!

3732
04:03:49,740 --> 04:03:51,740
Whoa!

3733
04:03:51,740 --> 04:03:53,740
Whoa!

3734
04:03:53,740 --> 04:03:56,740
Oh, look at that marvelous you need!

3735
04:03:56,740 --> 04:04:00,740
Please, someone, stop it, please!

3736
04:04:00,740 --> 04:04:02,740
Whoa!

3737
04:04:03,740 --> 04:04:06,740
That was terrific moment. Let's do it again!

3738
04:04:06,740 --> 04:04:08,740
Whoa!

3739
04:04:16,740 --> 04:04:18,740
What are you looking at, sorry you?

3740
04:04:18,740 --> 04:04:20,740
I can hear all my brothers howling out there.

3741
04:04:20,740 --> 04:04:22,740
They're probably hungry and looking for food.

3742
04:04:22,740 --> 04:04:25,740
No, I know they're calling me.

3743
04:04:25,740 --> 04:04:29,740
I'm going to see them. I've really got to a moment.

3744
04:04:32,740 --> 04:04:34,740
Whoa!

3745
04:04:40,740 --> 04:04:42,740
Oh.

3746
04:04:43,740 --> 04:04:45,740
Got anything?

3747
04:04:45,740 --> 04:04:47,740
No, not yet.

3748
04:04:47,740 --> 04:04:50,740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble. We're running out of jam.

3749
04:04:50,740 --> 04:04:52,740
Mr. Bresch, I suppose.

3750
04:04:52,740 --> 04:04:54,740
You can't stop eating it.

3751
04:04:54,740 --> 04:04:56,740
Well, you have to ask him to leave.

3752
04:04:56,740 --> 04:04:58,740
I can't do that.

3753
04:04:58,740 --> 04:05:02,740
Of course you can. It's your home and you can choose who you have.

3754
04:05:12,740 --> 04:05:15,740
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

3755
04:05:15,740 --> 04:05:18,740
Usually a sign that spring is not far away.

3756
04:05:29,740 --> 04:05:32,740
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

3757
04:05:32,740 --> 04:05:34,740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

3758
04:05:34,740 --> 04:05:36,740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

3759
04:05:36,740 --> 04:05:38,740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

3760
04:05:38,740 --> 04:05:40,740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

3761
04:05:40,740 --> 04:05:42,740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

3762
04:05:42,740 --> 04:05:44,740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

3763
04:05:44,740 --> 04:05:46,740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

3764
04:05:46,740 --> 04:05:48,740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

3765
04:05:48,740 --> 04:05:50,740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

3766
04:05:50,740 --> 04:05:52,740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

3767
04:05:52,740 --> 04:05:54,740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

3768
04:05:55,740 --> 04:05:57,740
I'm afraid.

3769
04:06:10,740 --> 04:06:12,740
Hello, woman!

3770
04:06:12,740 --> 04:06:14,740
Oh, hello, Mr. Bresch!

3771
04:06:14,740 --> 04:06:16,740
I'm sorry, but all the jams gone.

3772
04:06:16,740 --> 04:06:18,740
It's just an empty jar.

3773
04:06:18,740 --> 04:06:20,740
Oh, well, never mind.

3774
04:06:20,740 --> 04:06:22,740
It was a great jam.

3775
04:06:22,740 --> 04:06:27,140
things on my mind. You see, now that spring is here, I have to leave, Moomin Valley.

3776
04:06:29,220 --> 04:06:30,500
Oh, do you?

3777
04:06:32,660 --> 04:06:36,980
It's sad, but there you are. I have to go. Goodbye, Moomin.

3778
04:06:36,980 --> 04:06:38,420
Goodbye, then, Mr. Bursk.

3779
04:06:39,140 --> 04:06:49,620
Keep some jam for me.

3780
04:06:52,740 --> 04:07:20,740
Hello, I'm sorry. I'm your brother. I've wanted to be with you for a long, long time. I'm afraid I'm not very brave or strong, but if you'd let me stay with you...

3781
04:07:22,740 --> 04:07:24,420
Oh, don't you know me?

3782
04:07:26,420 --> 04:07:31,620
Looks like I was wrong. Oh, well, go on. Eat me if you want to.

3783
04:07:39,460 --> 04:07:45,300
It's a pity I didn't sleep at night instead of learning to how Moomin was right. I shouldn't have come.

3784
04:07:52,740 --> 04:08:22,740
I'm sorry, Moomin, I'm sorry, I didn't sleep at night, I'm sorry, I didn't sleep at night, I'm sorry, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I

3785
04:08:22,740 --> 04:08:52,740
didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night

3786
04:08:52,740 --> 04:09:22,740
I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep

3787
04:09:22,740 --> 04:09:52,740
I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night

3788
04:09:52,740 --> 04:10:04,340
but it's always time to rest, it's always time to rest, and it's always time to rest, and it's always time to rest, and it's always time to rest, me

3789
04:10:05,080 --> 04:10:07,280
Look, a little boy, Hang on to me

3790
04:10:08,240 --> 04:10:11,500
Thank you, Moonman! Let's go!

3791
04:10:20,920 --> 04:10:22,360
It's alright Moonman, don't panic. I'm with you. You're okay!

3792
04:10:22,740 --> 04:10:24,740
Oh, oh!

3793
04:10:25,740 --> 04:10:27,740
Over there, moving! Quick, do!

3794
04:10:29,740 --> 04:10:31,740
See, if you knew what I'd tell you,

3795
04:10:31,740 --> 04:10:33,740
there's nothing to be afraid of.

3796
04:10:33,740 --> 04:10:35,740
Just trust me, moving. I'm always right, aren't I?

3797
04:10:35,740 --> 04:10:37,740
Yes, I know you are, little my,

3798
04:10:37,740 --> 04:10:39,740
but we'd still better hurry.

3799
04:10:42,740 --> 04:10:45,740
Come on, you two, just a bit further!

3800
04:10:45,740 --> 04:10:46,740
Come on!

3801
04:10:51,740 --> 04:10:53,740
No!

3802
04:10:53,740 --> 04:10:54,740
Wow!

3803
04:10:55,740 --> 04:10:57,740
Oh, it's cold in here.

3804
04:10:57,740 --> 04:11:01,740
Quickly, let's get inside and light a fire, you'll soon warm up!

3805
04:11:05,740 --> 04:11:06,740
Phew!

3806
04:11:06,740 --> 04:11:16,740
And so Mr. Brisk and the ice both left human valley,

3807
04:11:16,740 --> 04:11:21,740
and spring returned once more after a long and eventful winter.

3808
04:11:23,740 --> 04:11:29,740
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements,

3809
04:11:29,740 --> 04:11:36,740
believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

3810
04:11:36,740 --> 04:11:40,740
They're always happy and always at play,

3811
04:11:40,740 --> 04:11:51,740
the movements are having fun day after day, the movements, the movements,

3812
04:11:51,740 --> 04:11:58,740
they loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements,

3813
04:11:58,740 --> 04:12:05,740
believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

3814
04:12:05,740 --> 04:12:10,740
They're always happy and always at play,

3815
04:12:10,740 --> 04:12:17,740
the movements are having fun day after day, the movements,

3816
04:12:17,740 --> 04:12:27,740
the movements, the movements.

3817
04:12:27,740 --> 04:12:52,740
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come,

3818
04:12:52,740 --> 04:12:55,740
come on and sit down here with me,

3819
04:12:55,740 --> 04:13:00,740
therefore you aren't your TV, they are the movements,

3820
04:13:00,740 --> 04:13:03,740
they are the movements,

3821
04:13:03,740 --> 04:13:06,740
so come with me, give me your hand,

3822
04:13:06,740 --> 04:13:09,740
I'll take you up to a moment land,

3823
04:13:09,740 --> 04:13:12,740
you can fly just like a bird,

3824
04:13:12,740 --> 04:13:17,740
sing that song ever, there were the movements,

3825
04:13:18,740 --> 04:13:29,740
there were the movements, there were the movements,

3826
04:13:29,740 --> 04:13:33,740
there were the movements.

3827
04:13:47,740 --> 04:14:17,740
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

3828
04:14:17,740 --> 04:14:47,740
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba It's spring again in Moomin Valley, And after their long winter hybrination, everyone is awake and enjoying the sunshine and the flowers. Everyone that is accept for Moomin was in bed with a terrible cold.

3829
04:14:47,740 --> 04:14:59,420
Oh dear, moment, that's a nasty cough.

3830
04:14:59,420 --> 04:15:02,180
My throat is very sore.

3831
04:15:02,180 --> 04:15:03,260
This will help soothe it.

3832
04:15:03,260 --> 04:15:06,700
It's one of grandma's best potions.

3833
04:15:06,700 --> 04:15:10,500
It's hard.

3834
04:15:10,500 --> 04:15:11,500
Never mind.

3835
04:15:11,500 --> 04:15:14,500
Nice tasting medicines don't always work as well.

3836
04:15:15,500 --> 04:15:19,340
I wanted to go out, it's spring.

3837
04:15:19,340 --> 04:15:23,500
I know dear, but you'd catch pneumonia or something.

3838
04:15:23,500 --> 04:15:29,500
Mama, does anyone know why snuffkin hasn't come back yet?

3839
04:15:29,500 --> 04:15:37,500
No, perhaps spring came earlier this year and he wasn't ready.

3840
04:15:37,500 --> 04:15:43,140
Snuffkin had always come back to Moonman Valley on the very first day of spring.

3841
04:15:43,140 --> 04:15:49,140
But not this year.

3842
04:15:49,140 --> 04:15:57,140
Snuffkin.

3843
04:15:57,140 --> 04:15:58,140
Hi, moment, Papa.

3844
04:15:58,140 --> 04:15:59,140
Is moment any better?

3845
04:15:59,140 --> 04:16:01,140
No, I'm afraid not.

3846
04:16:01,140 --> 04:16:02,140
He's still got a nasty cough.

3847
04:16:02,140 --> 04:16:04,140
Can I go up and see him?

3848
04:16:04,140 --> 04:16:05,140
No, you'd better not.

3849
04:16:05,140 --> 04:16:11,140
You might catch it.

3850
04:16:12,140 --> 04:16:14,140
You know how poorly you get when you're ill.

3851
04:16:14,140 --> 04:16:15,140
It's best not to take the risk.

3852
04:16:15,140 --> 04:16:18,140
I should think he'll be up and about before very long.

3853
04:16:18,140 --> 04:16:21,140
Yes, it's better to be safe than sorry.

3854
04:16:21,140 --> 04:16:25,140
Moment shouldn't have gone out in the winter, should he, Mama?

3855
04:16:25,140 --> 04:16:27,140
No, but he couldn't go back to sleep.

3856
04:16:27,140 --> 04:16:30,140
Snow would have that effect on anyone.

3857
04:16:30,140 --> 04:16:34,140
I knew little Mai was out in the cold with him and look at her.

3858
04:16:34,140 --> 04:16:38,140
She seems healthy enough.

3859
04:16:38,140 --> 04:16:40,140
I'll take these flowers to Moonman later.

3860
04:16:40,140 --> 04:16:50,140
Little Mai's too small to catch a cold.

3861
04:16:50,140 --> 04:16:52,140
This is boring.

3862
04:16:52,140 --> 04:16:55,140
I can't believe that Moonman's sick.

3863
04:16:55,140 --> 04:16:58,140
And Snuffkin's not back either.

3864
04:16:58,140 --> 04:17:00,140
I sure wonder what's happened to him.

3865
04:17:00,140 --> 04:17:04,140
I bet you moment gets better as soon as Snuffkin arrives in Moonman Valley.

3866
04:17:04,140 --> 04:17:08,140
He's never been this late coming back before.

3867
04:17:08,140 --> 04:17:11,140
Perhaps he's got fed up with you guys.

3868
04:17:11,140 --> 04:17:13,140
Impossible. He's very fond of me.

3869
04:17:13,140 --> 04:17:15,140
He's told me so lots of times.

3870
04:17:15,140 --> 04:17:18,140
He likes Moonman too, of course.

3871
04:17:18,140 --> 04:17:21,140
He might have been captured by a highwayman.

3872
04:17:21,140 --> 04:17:23,140
Let's go and look for him.

3873
04:17:23,140 --> 04:17:25,140
A highwayman?

3874
04:17:25,140 --> 04:17:26,140
First Snuffkin, silly.

3875
04:17:26,140 --> 04:17:28,140
He's got to come back so Moonman will get better.

3876
04:17:28,140 --> 04:17:30,140
We must find him.

3877
04:17:30,140 --> 04:17:32,140
But where do we look, Snork Maiden?

3878
04:17:32,140 --> 04:17:33,140
In the south.

3879
04:17:33,140 --> 04:17:35,140
It's a big place. He could be anywhere.

3880
04:17:35,140 --> 04:17:38,140
Well, I don't care how big it is I'm going anyway.

3881
04:17:38,140 --> 04:17:39,140
You're being silly.

3882
04:17:39,140 --> 04:17:40,140
No, I'm not.

3883
04:17:40,140 --> 04:17:42,140
I don't think your brother will like it.

3884
04:17:42,140 --> 04:17:44,140
In fact, I know he won't.

3885
04:17:44,140 --> 04:17:46,140
Have you gone completely bananas?

3886
04:17:46,140 --> 04:17:48,140
No, I haven't.

3887
04:17:48,140 --> 04:17:50,140
And you'll just have to make your own muffins.

3888
04:17:50,140 --> 04:17:52,140
There's more to food than muffins.

3889
04:17:52,140 --> 04:17:54,140
I was speaking figuratively.

3890
04:17:54,140 --> 04:17:56,140
Anyway, I'm going, dear brother.

3891
04:17:56,140 --> 04:17:59,140
And nothing you can do or say will stop me.

3892
04:17:59,140 --> 04:18:00,140
It's for Moonman.

3893
04:18:00,140 --> 04:18:02,140
That's a sort of hair brain scheme

3894
04:18:02,140 --> 04:18:04,140
that could only have been dreamed up by you.

3895
04:18:04,140 --> 04:18:05,140
What good will it do?

3896
04:18:05,140 --> 04:18:07,140
You don't even know where he is.

3897
04:18:07,140 --> 04:18:10,140
It is not. Moonman is pining for Snuffkin.

3898
04:18:10,140 --> 04:18:11,140
Rubbish.

3899
04:18:11,140 --> 04:18:13,140
Men don't pine for their friends.

3900
04:18:13,140 --> 04:18:15,140
If he isn't back yet, then he isn't coming.

3901
04:18:15,140 --> 04:18:18,140
And if he isn't going to come, what's the point of looking for him?

3902
04:18:18,140 --> 04:18:20,140
You won't find him anyway.

3903
04:18:22,140 --> 04:18:25,140
He will come when he knows that Moonman is sick.

3904
04:18:25,140 --> 04:18:27,140
Black mails just like a sister.

3905
04:18:27,140 --> 04:18:30,140
Something done for love could never be blackmail.

3906
04:18:30,140 --> 04:18:32,140
Oh no, you're not going and that's fine.

3907
04:18:32,140 --> 04:18:35,140
Look, why don't you and Little My go by yourselves?

3908
04:18:35,140 --> 04:18:38,140
Oh, well, I didn't really make a definite decision.

3909
04:18:38,140 --> 04:18:40,140
I just sort of said that I might come along.

3910
04:18:40,140 --> 04:18:43,140
But if Snort Maiden isn't going, then there doesn't seem any point.

3911
04:18:43,140 --> 04:18:44,140
Does there?

3912
04:18:44,140 --> 04:18:47,140
And I'm not going because I think it's stupid and hair brain too.

3913
04:18:47,140 --> 04:18:49,140
Snuffkin will come back soon.

3914
04:18:49,140 --> 04:18:50,140
Not Snort Maiden.

3915
04:18:50,140 --> 04:18:51,140
What do you say to that?

3916
04:18:59,140 --> 04:19:01,140
How is Moonman feeling any better?

3917
04:19:01,140 --> 04:19:04,140
He's asleep now, but the cough doesn't seem so bad.

3918
04:19:04,140 --> 04:19:05,140
And his temperature?

3919
04:19:05,140 --> 04:19:06,140
Still quite high.

3920
04:19:32,140 --> 04:19:33,140
Snuffkin!

3921
04:19:52,140 --> 04:19:54,140
Am I pleased to see you, Moonman?

3922
04:19:54,140 --> 04:19:56,140
You look like you needed a lift.

3923
04:19:56,140 --> 04:20:00,140
This magic cloud must be one of those we got from the Hobgoblin's top hat.

3924
04:20:01,140 --> 04:20:03,140
That's right. I had one of them away.

3925
04:20:03,140 --> 04:20:06,140
What a good idea, Moonman. You are clever.

3926
04:20:06,140 --> 04:20:09,140
Well, it was so much fun the last time, wasn't it?

3927
04:20:09,140 --> 04:20:10,140
Hi, Moonman!

3928
04:20:10,140 --> 04:20:11,140
Hi!

3929
04:20:11,140 --> 04:20:13,140
Oh, look, Snuffkin.

3930
04:20:13,140 --> 04:20:15,140
I didn't know they were here, too.

3931
04:20:20,140 --> 04:20:21,140
Snuffkin!

3932
04:20:25,140 --> 04:20:27,140
Moments!

3933
04:20:27,140 --> 04:20:28,140
Snuffkin!

3934
04:20:31,140 --> 04:20:32,140
Oh!

3935
04:20:38,140 --> 04:20:40,140
Not just a dream.

3936
04:20:40,140 --> 04:20:41,140
Snuffkin!

3937
04:20:48,140 --> 04:20:50,140
You look blousy, Moonman.

3938
04:20:50,140 --> 04:20:53,140
Oh, thanks, stinky. You'd better keep away.

3939
04:20:53,140 --> 04:20:55,140
There's no need bugs and things like that.

3940
04:20:55,140 --> 04:20:56,140
Stay away from me.

3941
04:20:56,140 --> 04:20:58,140
They're probably frightened of someone so healthy.

3942
04:20:58,140 --> 04:21:01,140
Mom, I wasn't letting anyone in here. It's very dull.

3943
04:21:01,140 --> 04:21:03,140
You followed a bed or something?

3944
04:21:03,140 --> 04:21:04,140
Yes, I did.

3945
04:21:04,140 --> 04:21:06,140
I know. You were dreaming, weren't you?

3946
04:21:06,140 --> 04:21:08,140
Unfortunately, yes.

3947
04:21:08,140 --> 04:21:10,140
I know how you feel.

3948
04:21:10,140 --> 04:21:12,140
I have that dream a lot.

3949
04:21:12,140 --> 04:21:17,140
Oh, you stand on a windowsill getting ready to break the glass

3950
04:21:17,140 --> 04:21:19,140
and inside there's diamonds.

3951
04:21:19,140 --> 04:21:21,140
And then, Moonman, you fall.

3952
04:21:21,140 --> 04:21:23,140
It's not the same dream at all, stinky.

3953
04:21:23,140 --> 04:21:25,140
Snuffkin hasn't come back yet.

3954
04:21:25,140 --> 04:21:27,140
Have you heard anything from him?

3955
04:21:27,140 --> 04:21:28,140
He's very late.

3956
04:21:28,140 --> 04:21:30,140
Oh, Snuffkin.

3957
04:21:30,140 --> 04:21:32,140
Huh. You know something, don't you?

3958
04:21:32,140 --> 04:21:35,140
All I know is that he went away as usual last autumn

3959
04:21:35,140 --> 04:21:36,140
and hasn't come back yet.

3960
04:21:36,140 --> 04:21:37,140
And then...

3961
04:21:37,140 --> 04:21:38,140
Yes, what?

3962
04:21:38,140 --> 04:21:41,140
Snork Maiden wanted to go looking for him because she thinks

3963
04:21:41,140 --> 04:21:44,140
that if Snuffkin comes back, you won't be sick anymore.

3964
04:21:44,140 --> 04:21:46,140
But Snork wouldn't let her.

3965
04:21:46,140 --> 04:21:48,140
Snork Maiden?

3966
04:21:50,140 --> 04:21:52,140
Hey, Snork Maiden!

3967
04:21:52,140 --> 04:21:54,140
Snork Maiden!

3968
04:21:58,140 --> 04:22:00,140
You're not serious, are you?

3969
04:22:00,140 --> 04:22:02,140
I feel perfectly alright.

3970
04:22:02,140 --> 04:22:05,140
You look like that's warmed up if you ask me.

3971
04:22:05,140 --> 04:22:06,140
Thanks a lot.

3972
04:22:06,140 --> 04:22:11,140
Now, stinky, tell me which way does Snuffkin normally travel south?

3973
04:22:11,140 --> 04:22:13,140
Hey, are you going looking for him?

3974
04:22:13,140 --> 04:22:17,140
Yes, it's not really spring in Moonman Valley if he's not around.

3975
04:22:17,140 --> 04:22:19,140
It's just not right somehow.

3976
04:22:19,140 --> 04:22:22,140
Okay, you're all as mad as each other.

3977
04:22:22,140 --> 04:22:24,140
But you'll help me?

3978
04:22:24,140 --> 04:22:27,140
I've got to try and find him, stinky.

3979
04:22:27,140 --> 04:22:30,140
Yes, alright, but don't tell your parents I helped you.

3980
04:22:30,140 --> 04:22:32,140
Don't worry, I won't say a thing.

3981
04:22:48,140 --> 04:22:51,140
Sorry, stinky, are you okay?

3982
04:22:51,140 --> 04:22:53,140
No, I'm fine.

3983
04:22:55,140 --> 04:22:58,140
Here's your lunch, Moonman. How are you feeling?

3984
04:22:58,140 --> 04:23:00,140
Moonman?

3985
04:23:00,140 --> 04:23:03,140
Papa, come here quickly.

3986
04:23:06,140 --> 04:23:09,140
Oh, Papa, Moonman's gone. He's not in his bed.

3987
04:23:09,140 --> 04:23:12,140
Not in his bed? Are you sure, Mama?

3988
04:23:12,140 --> 04:23:17,140
Of course I am. His room is empty and there's no sign of him.

3989
04:23:18,140 --> 04:23:20,140
Perhaps he's in one of the other rooms.

3990
04:23:20,140 --> 04:23:22,140
Don't worry, Mama, I'll find him.

3991
04:23:25,140 --> 04:23:28,140
Yo, Moonman.

3992
04:23:29,140 --> 04:23:31,140
Moonman.

3993
04:23:32,140 --> 04:23:34,140
Hi, Moonman, Papa.

3994
04:23:34,140 --> 04:23:35,140
Oh, little Mai.

3995
04:23:35,140 --> 04:23:37,140
What's wrong? You look worried.

3996
04:23:37,140 --> 04:23:39,140
Moonman's gone off somewhere.

3997
04:23:39,140 --> 04:23:42,140
I expect he must have gone to look for Snuffkin.

3998
04:23:42,140 --> 04:23:44,140
Snuffkin?

3999
04:23:44,140 --> 04:23:47,140
Well, you know how crazy Moonman is about him.

4000
04:23:47,140 --> 04:23:49,140
It's stupid if you ask me.

4001
04:23:49,140 --> 04:23:52,140
But he's not well, he's got a fever.

4002
04:24:15,140 --> 04:24:19,140
Are you sure this is the right way?

4003
04:24:19,140 --> 04:24:22,140
Of course I'm sure. I live in this forest, don't I?

4004
04:24:22,140 --> 04:24:24,140
Why don't we miss each other somewhere?

4005
04:24:24,140 --> 04:24:27,140
Well, if you think he might, don't go there and it's up to you.

4006
04:24:27,140 --> 04:24:29,140
But I've got to...

4007
04:24:32,140 --> 04:24:33,140
Moonman!

4008
04:24:33,140 --> 04:24:35,140
Oh, Snuffkin!

4009
04:24:35,140 --> 04:24:37,140
Huh?

4010
04:24:37,140 --> 04:24:40,140
Where are you taking him, Stinky? You can see he's not well.

4011
04:24:40,140 --> 04:24:44,140
I'm not taking him. He insisted on going. I came to look after him.

4012
04:24:44,140 --> 04:24:46,140
Is that really right, Moonman?

4013
04:24:46,140 --> 04:24:50,140
Yes, I wanted to find Snuffkin, so he'd come back.

4014
04:24:50,140 --> 04:24:52,140
Well, I was going to find him for you.

4015
04:24:52,140 --> 04:24:55,140
Little Mai and Sniff were coming too, but they chickened out so I came on my own.

4016
04:24:55,140 --> 04:24:58,140
What did Snork say about that? I bet he wasn't happy.

4017
04:24:58,140 --> 04:25:00,140
Oh, he made a big fuss and I just let him.

4018
04:25:00,140 --> 04:25:02,140
So you just walked out and came on your own?

4019
04:25:02,140 --> 04:25:04,140
Brothers, always think they can tell you what to do.

4020
04:25:04,140 --> 04:25:07,140
I just ignored him. Did you tell your parents where you were?

4021
04:25:07,140 --> 04:25:09,140
Ah, no.

4022
04:25:09,140 --> 04:25:12,140
Did you put him up to this, Stinky? It's just the sort of thing you do.

4023
04:25:12,140 --> 04:25:13,140
No, I did not.

4024
04:25:13,140 --> 04:25:15,140
That's true, Snork Maiden.

4025
04:25:17,140 --> 04:25:21,140
Well, I don't know how you did it, Stinky, but I know you and I know you're to blame and I don't think I won't find out.

4026
04:25:21,140 --> 04:25:24,140
That's not fair, Snork Maiden. It was nothing to do with me at all.

4027
04:25:24,140 --> 04:25:26,140
Oh, he's right, Snork Maiden.

4028
04:25:26,140 --> 04:25:29,140
He didn't want to show me the way, but I made him.

4029
04:25:31,140 --> 04:25:33,140
I'm taking you home.

4030
04:25:33,140 --> 04:25:34,140
Oh, but Snork Maiden.

4031
04:25:34,140 --> 04:25:39,140
Look, no buttons. You're sick and you should be in bed and your parents must be very worried.

4032
04:25:39,140 --> 04:25:41,140
Look!

4033
04:25:41,140 --> 04:25:42,140
Moomin!

4034
04:25:42,140 --> 04:25:45,140
Oh, it's Papa. It isn't Snork behind him.

4035
04:25:45,140 --> 04:25:47,140
Oh, yes, it is.

4036
04:25:47,140 --> 04:25:49,140
Uh-oh, it's time I wasn't here.

4037
04:25:49,140 --> 04:25:53,140
I'm glad you hadn't gone too far, Moomin. I might never have found you.

4038
04:25:53,140 --> 04:25:55,140
I'm very sorry, Papa.

4039
04:25:57,140 --> 04:26:01,140
I have a feeling you're behind this, Stinky. Come on quickly, I'll with it.

4040
04:26:01,140 --> 04:26:05,140
Why doesn't anyone believe me? It was Moomin's idea. I swear it was.

4041
04:26:05,140 --> 04:26:08,140
It was, Papa. I wanted to find Snorkkin.

4042
04:26:08,140 --> 04:26:11,140
Are you all right, Moomin?

4043
04:26:11,140 --> 04:26:13,140
Snork Maiden!

4044
04:26:14,140 --> 04:26:17,140
Uh, here we go again.

4045
04:26:17,140 --> 04:26:21,140
Snork Maiden, what are you doing here? I thought I told you not to go on this silly jump.

4046
04:26:21,140 --> 04:26:24,140
Well, I didn't say I wouldn't. Did I?

4047
04:26:24,140 --> 04:26:26,140
Listen to me, Snork.

4048
04:26:26,140 --> 04:26:30,140
You're looking guilty, Stinky. How did you persuade her to disobey me?

4049
04:26:30,140 --> 04:26:32,140
See, I told you.

4050
04:26:38,140 --> 04:26:42,140
You stay nice and warm in bed and I'll mix some of grandma's potion with honey for you.

4051
04:26:42,140 --> 04:26:47,140
You'll have to be better soon because I have a feeling Snuffkin's on his way.

4052
04:26:53,140 --> 04:26:57,140
My wish Snuffkin would hurry up, then we could all get back to normal at last.

4053
04:26:57,140 --> 04:27:00,140
First, my sentiment's exactly.

4054
04:27:00,140 --> 04:27:05,140
So where is Snuffkin? Well, he's on his way back to Moomin Valley.

4055
04:27:05,140 --> 04:27:10,140
But he's had a very long walk and is getting very tired now.

4056
04:27:10,140 --> 04:27:25,140
Poor Snuffkin. He's had a terrible cold as well. This feeling rather weak.

4057
04:27:41,140 --> 04:27:52,140
Hello, I know you don't I?

4058
04:27:52,140 --> 04:27:56,140
Oh? Yes, you're Snuffkin.

4059
04:28:10,140 --> 04:28:13,140
Isn't that water still a little cold for that?

4060
04:28:21,140 --> 04:28:25,140
You'd better come by the fire and keep warm or you'll catch cold.

4061
04:28:30,140 --> 04:28:33,140
This is nice.

4062
04:28:33,140 --> 04:28:44,140
I'll be the one that's that by Snuffkin's fire. And he told me to keep warm and not catch cold.

4063
04:28:44,140 --> 04:28:48,140
That's no big thing, little fella. It's a pretty chilly night out here.

4064
04:28:48,140 --> 04:28:52,140
Oh, it is. I've heard so many stories about you from everybody.

4065
04:28:52,140 --> 04:28:57,140
And each year I try to watch you go past, but I've never been brave enough to talk to you before.

4066
04:28:57,140 --> 04:29:02,140
Stories from everybody. I don't know if I like that. In fact, I'm sure I don't.

4067
04:29:02,140 --> 04:29:05,140
What's your name, little fella?

4068
04:29:05,140 --> 04:29:12,140
Oh, well, I haven't got one. I'm so small that nobody's ever asked me before. I've always wanted to have a name, you know.

4069
04:29:12,140 --> 04:29:19,140
And it was you who asked me. And I've actually met you and sat next to you at your campfire. Oh, it's so wonderful.

4070
04:29:19,140 --> 04:29:22,140
You don't know how happy it makes me meeting you like this.

4071
04:29:22,140 --> 04:29:25,140
Oh, come on. You do go on a bit, old fella. You just get warm now.

4072
04:29:25,140 --> 04:29:33,140
Do you think Snuffkin? Oh, I don't know whether I should ask you. I don't want to offend you. Oh, well, why not? Yes, I will.

4073
04:29:33,140 --> 04:29:40,140
Perhaps you'd be kind enough to. I mean, would it be too much trouble for you to think of a name for me?

4074
04:29:40,140 --> 04:29:44,140
There. I've said it now.

4075
04:29:44,140 --> 04:29:49,140
Well, choosing a name is important. I'd have to think carefully about that.

4076
04:29:49,140 --> 04:29:52,140
But it will be easy for you. You know everything.

4077
04:29:52,140 --> 04:29:57,140
Now listen to me. You can't look up to people too much if you want to be yourself. It's not right.

4078
04:29:57,140 --> 04:30:02,140
But Snuffkin, you're so clever. You can do anything, anything at all. I know you can.

4079
04:30:02,140 --> 04:30:07,140
I've always wanted to be free like you to do whatever I feel.

4080
04:30:07,140 --> 04:30:13,140
Oh, I'm sorry I'm talking too much. I want to listen to you too. All about your travels for a start.

4081
04:30:13,140 --> 04:30:16,140
I know you're on your way to the Moon Valley to see all your friends.

4082
04:30:16,140 --> 04:30:21,140
The Hedgehog told me the Moon stayed up for most of the winter. Just waiting for you to come back.

4083
04:30:21,140 --> 04:30:23,140
Now isn't that wonderful? What?

4084
04:30:23,140 --> 04:30:27,140
I'd love to have someone that missed me so much they were miserable until I came back.

4085
04:30:27,140 --> 04:30:30,140
You don't know how lucky you are that you're so special.

4086
04:30:30,140 --> 04:30:35,140
Well, perhaps I'm not going there. I might have somewhere else to visit instead.

4087
04:30:38,140 --> 04:30:42,140
Oh, Moon will be very sad if you don't go back.

4088
04:30:42,140 --> 04:30:45,140
Yes, but you've got to have time to be on your own as well.

4089
04:30:45,140 --> 04:30:49,140
Of course you have, and I've taken up too much of yours now.

4090
04:30:49,140 --> 04:30:52,140
Wait, I think I'll be off. Okay, thanks.

4091
04:30:57,140 --> 04:30:59,140
Goodbye Snuffkin.

4092
04:30:59,140 --> 04:31:01,140
Good night, little fella.

4093
04:31:01,140 --> 04:31:08,140
Hey, wait a minute. What about your name?

4094
04:31:08,140 --> 04:31:10,140
You remembered!

4095
04:31:10,140 --> 04:31:14,140
Well, what do you think of TD Wu, my friend?

4096
04:31:14,140 --> 04:31:20,140
Yes, TD Wu. It's nice and happy to start with, and then a little sadness.

4097
04:31:20,140 --> 04:31:22,140
TD Wu.

4098
04:31:23,140 --> 04:31:26,140
That's right, TD Wu.

4099
04:31:26,140 --> 04:31:29,140
TD Wu.

4100
04:31:29,140 --> 04:31:32,140
TD Wu.

4101
04:31:32,140 --> 04:31:34,140
TD Wu.

4102
04:31:34,140 --> 04:31:36,140
TD Wu.

4103
04:31:36,140 --> 04:31:38,140
TD Wu.

4104
04:31:38,140 --> 04:31:40,140
TD Wu.

4105
04:31:40,140 --> 04:31:42,140
TD Wu.

4106
04:31:42,140 --> 04:31:44,140
TD Wu.

4107
04:31:44,140 --> 04:31:46,140
TD Wu.

4108
04:31:46,140 --> 04:31:50,140
Yeah, that's great. It's a wonderful name.

4109
04:31:51,140 --> 04:31:56,140
TD Wu. I'm glad you like it. It's the first time I've ever given anyone a name.

4110
04:31:59,140 --> 04:32:04,140
I think I'll be able to house, and then I can put up a real name plate that says TD Wu.

4111
04:32:04,140 --> 04:32:07,140
Ah, good idea, TD Wu. About what I said before.

4112
04:32:07,140 --> 04:32:08,140
Huh?

4113
04:32:08,140 --> 04:32:14,140
You know, not going back to Moonman Valley? Well, I am. I've missed Moonman and all my friends.

4114
04:32:14,140 --> 04:32:19,140
Oh, I didn't take that seriously. You just got upset at something, I said.

4115
04:32:19,140 --> 04:32:22,140
I'm afraid that happens a lot, I guess I talk too much.

4116
04:32:22,140 --> 04:32:24,140
Maybe you do.

4117
04:32:24,140 --> 04:32:29,140
I'll be going back to Moonman Valley a bit behind schedule, and this year Spring came along early too.

4118
04:32:29,140 --> 04:32:33,140
But I suppose it's better late than never, as they say.

4119
04:32:33,140 --> 04:32:37,140
Moonman will be happy. Say hello to everyone from TD Wu.

4120
04:32:37,140 --> 04:32:41,140
I will, and I'll tell them how it came about.

4121
04:32:41,140 --> 04:32:46,140
That's where you keep your harmonica, isn't it, Snuffkin? It's really famous, you know?

4122
04:32:46,140 --> 04:32:48,140
I didn't realize that.

4123
04:32:48,140 --> 04:32:52,140
Do you know? I've never ever heard any music.

4124
04:32:55,140 --> 04:32:57,140
Really? What would you like me to play?

4125
04:32:57,140 --> 04:33:02,140
Anything. Oh, I know. What about Moonman's favorite?

4126
04:33:18,140 --> 04:33:23,140
Oh, that's Snuffkin!

4127
04:33:38,140 --> 04:33:41,140
Oh, that's Snuffkin!

4128
04:33:48,140 --> 04:33:53,140
Don't move!

4129
04:34:08,140 --> 04:34:12,140
Snuffkin!

4130
04:34:18,140 --> 04:34:23,140
Snuffkin!

4131
04:34:33,140 --> 04:34:39,140
Now at last, Spring really has come to Moonman Valley.

4132
04:34:39,140 --> 04:34:46,140
They love the laughter, and they love the living, the movements.

4133
04:34:46,140 --> 04:34:53,140
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

4134
04:34:53,140 --> 04:34:57,140
They're always happy and always at play.

4135
04:34:57,140 --> 04:35:04,140
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

4136
04:35:04,140 --> 04:35:08,140
The movements.

4137
04:35:08,140 --> 04:35:15,140
They love the laughter, and they love the living, the movements.

4138
04:35:15,140 --> 04:35:22,140
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

4139
04:35:22,140 --> 04:35:26,140
They're always happy and always at play.

4140
04:35:26,140 --> 04:35:33,140
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

4141
04:35:33,140 --> 04:35:38,140
The movements.

4142
04:35:38,140 --> 04:35:43,140
The movements.

4143
04:36:03,140 --> 04:36:06,140
Here they are for one and all.

4144
04:36:06,140 --> 04:36:09,140
The movements are about to come.

4145
04:36:09,140 --> 04:36:12,140
Come on and sit down here with me.

4146
04:36:12,140 --> 04:36:17,140
They're here for you on your TV. They are the movements.

4147
04:36:17,140 --> 04:36:20,140
They are the movements.

4148
04:36:20,140 --> 04:36:23,140
So come with me, give me your hand.

4149
04:36:23,140 --> 04:36:26,140
I'll take you up to Moonman Land.

4150
04:36:26,140 --> 04:36:29,140
You can fly just like a bird.

4151
04:36:29,140 --> 04:36:32,140
Sing that song ever.

4152
04:36:32,140 --> 04:36:34,140
There were the movements.

4153
04:36:34,140 --> 04:36:37,140
There were the movements.

4154
04:36:37,140 --> 04:36:40,140
There were the movements.

4155
04:36:40,140 --> 04:36:43,140
There were the movements.

4156
04:36:43,140 --> 04:36:46,140
There were the movements.

4157
04:36:46,140 --> 04:36:49,140
There were the movements.

4158
04:36:59,140 --> 04:37:27,140
All is peaceful in Moonman Valley.

4159
04:37:27,140 --> 04:37:30,140
Mama waters the flowers.

4160
04:37:30,140 --> 04:37:34,140
While Papa relaxes in the shade on the porch.

4161
04:37:34,140 --> 04:37:39,140
Look, Mama, Moonman Papa is sleeping again.

4162
04:37:39,140 --> 04:37:41,140
He had a long nap yesterday.

4163
04:37:41,140 --> 04:37:43,140
I think it must be the weather.

4164
04:37:43,140 --> 04:37:45,140
Too hot and sunny for me.

4165
04:37:45,140 --> 04:37:48,140
I wonder if he's worried about anything.

4166
04:37:48,140 --> 04:37:53,140
You don't sleep if you're worried you do something about it.

4167
04:37:53,140 --> 04:37:56,140
But Moonman Papa does have something on his mind.

4168
04:37:56,140 --> 04:37:59,140
Although it doesn't keep him awake.

4169
04:38:03,140 --> 04:38:07,140
He's having a nice dream as well.

4170
04:38:08,140 --> 04:38:17,140
Mama waters the flowers.

4171
04:38:17,140 --> 04:38:23,140
Mama waters the flowers.

4172
04:38:23,140 --> 04:38:26,140
Oh, a lighthouse.

4173
04:38:26,140 --> 04:38:27,140
That's it.

4174
04:38:27,140 --> 04:38:29,140
Oh, oh, oh.

4175
04:38:29,140 --> 04:38:32,140
That's it, a lighthouse.

4176
04:38:32,140 --> 04:38:34,140
What about a lighthouse, Papa?

4177
04:38:34,140 --> 04:38:36,140
We're going to visit one.

4178
04:38:36,140 --> 04:38:37,140
Right now.

4179
04:38:37,140 --> 04:38:40,140
Well, as soon as I find one, anyway.

4180
04:38:40,140 --> 04:38:43,140
That should stop you being bored, Mama.

4181
04:38:43,140 --> 04:38:45,140
Oh, I'm not really dear, but it would be nice.

4182
04:38:45,140 --> 04:38:46,140
Yeah.

4183
04:38:46,140 --> 04:38:48,140
Oh, I'm really excited.

4184
04:38:48,140 --> 04:38:50,140
Just because it doesn't let me.

4185
04:38:50,140 --> 04:38:52,140
Lovely water.

4186
04:38:52,140 --> 04:38:56,140
Yeah, I'll write an exciting, epic novel of the sea.

4187
04:38:56,140 --> 04:38:58,140
I'm sure it will be a great success.

4188
04:38:58,140 --> 04:39:02,140
If he puts some action in it and misses out the romantic stuff.

4189
04:39:07,140 --> 04:39:09,140
Stop it!

4190
04:39:12,140 --> 04:39:14,140
Stop it!

4191
04:39:14,140 --> 04:39:16,140
Stop it!

4192
04:39:20,140 --> 04:39:21,140
Tell me.

4193
04:39:21,140 --> 04:39:24,140
Does Moonman Papa want all of you to go away to this lighthouse?

4194
04:39:24,140 --> 04:39:25,140
Oh, yes.

4195
04:39:25,140 --> 04:39:26,140
It'll be great fun.

4196
04:39:26,140 --> 04:39:28,140
Just think of all the ships we'll be able to see.

4197
04:39:28,140 --> 04:39:30,140
Yes, that will be good.

4198
04:39:30,140 --> 04:39:33,140
Papa says he wants to write an exciting story about the sea.

4199
04:39:33,140 --> 04:39:37,140
With ships and storms and stuff, probably pirates too.

4200
04:39:37,140 --> 04:39:40,140
Oh, he's stuck writing his memoirs again, is he?

4201
04:39:40,140 --> 04:39:43,140
Well, I guess that might have something to do with it.

4202
04:39:43,140 --> 04:39:45,140
But I think he just wants another adventure.

4203
04:39:45,140 --> 04:39:46,140
He's bored.

4204
04:39:46,140 --> 04:39:48,140
Well, it sounds a bit odd to me, Moonman.

4205
04:39:48,140 --> 04:39:49,140
No, it's not.

4206
04:39:49,140 --> 04:39:53,140
We're going to live in a real lighthouse and save ships from the rocks

4207
04:39:53,140 --> 04:39:55,140
and being wrecked terrible storms.

4208
04:39:55,140 --> 04:39:56,140
Oh, I see.

4209
04:39:56,140 --> 04:39:59,140
What do you think the lighthouse keeper might say about you moving in?

4210
04:39:59,140 --> 04:40:01,140
Oh, he won't mind at all.

4211
04:40:01,140 --> 04:40:04,140
It'll be company for him, and I'm sure he'd like someone to talk to.

4212
04:40:04,140 --> 04:40:07,140
Looking after a lighthouse is a very lonely job.

4213
04:40:07,140 --> 04:40:12,140
Ah, but if you thought Moonman, that might be exactly why he chooses to do it.

4214
04:40:12,140 --> 04:40:16,140
You mean that he might want to be on his own all the time?

4215
04:40:16,140 --> 04:40:19,140
Well, some people like it like that.

4216
04:40:19,140 --> 04:40:22,140
Sometimes I like being on my own.

4217
04:40:22,140 --> 04:40:24,140
Not for long, though.

4218
04:40:24,140 --> 04:40:26,140
It'll be a lot of fun.

4219
04:40:26,140 --> 04:40:28,140
Snuffkin, why don't you come with us?

4220
04:40:29,140 --> 04:40:31,140
What, to a lonely lighthouse?

4221
04:40:31,140 --> 04:40:34,140
Yes.

4222
04:40:34,140 --> 04:40:38,140
Ah, no, which one is it?

4223
04:40:38,140 --> 04:40:40,140
There, that's the one.

4224
04:40:40,140 --> 04:40:41,140
Where?

4225
04:40:41,140 --> 04:40:44,140
So small, you can hardly see it.

4226
04:40:44,140 --> 04:40:47,140
How long would it take us to get there, Moonman, Papa?

4227
04:40:47,140 --> 04:40:49,140
A day or two, I should say.

4228
04:40:49,140 --> 04:40:50,140
Depending on the window.

4229
04:40:50,140 --> 04:40:51,140
But it looks so tiny.

4230
04:40:51,140 --> 04:40:52,140
Oh, I don't know.

4231
04:40:52,140 --> 04:40:54,140
Well, I think so.

4232
04:40:54,140 --> 04:40:56,140
How do we know which one is which?

4233
04:40:56,140 --> 04:40:59,140
Oh, don't you worry about that.

4234
04:40:59,140 --> 04:41:02,140
I've got an old compass somewhere, and we've got the map.

4235
04:41:02,140 --> 04:41:05,140
Then at night we'll be able to see the light itself.

4236
04:41:05,140 --> 04:41:07,140
Anyway, an old sailor.

4237
04:41:07,140 --> 04:41:08,140
An old sailor?

4238
04:41:08,140 --> 04:41:10,140
Well, I'm not really that young.

4239
04:41:10,140 --> 04:41:11,140
And an old sailor.

4240
04:41:11,140 --> 04:41:12,140
Is this mutiny?

4241
04:41:12,140 --> 04:41:15,140
Don't be stupid.

4242
04:41:15,140 --> 04:41:17,140
How long do you think you'll want to stay, Papa?

4243
04:41:17,140 --> 04:41:18,140
About a month.

4244
04:41:18,140 --> 04:41:22,140
Oh, we'll need to take lots and lots of food, then.

4245
04:41:22,140 --> 04:41:24,140
Well, bless me.

4246
04:41:24,140 --> 04:41:25,140
I think that'll be enough, Mama.

4247
04:41:25,140 --> 04:41:27,140
Surely there'll be somebody living there already.

4248
04:41:27,140 --> 04:41:29,140
Don't be stupid, of course there is.

4249
04:41:29,140 --> 04:41:31,140
A lighthouse must have a keeper.

4250
04:41:31,140 --> 04:41:34,140
Yes, a man dedicated to the sea.

4251
04:41:34,140 --> 04:41:36,140
Suffering loneliness and hardship.

4252
04:41:36,140 --> 04:41:39,140
Saving countless lives with no regard for his own.

4253
04:41:45,140 --> 04:41:47,140
Is that you, Sniff?

4254
04:41:47,140 --> 04:41:49,140
Yes, hi, Mr. Hamilton.

4255
04:41:49,140 --> 04:41:52,140
I thought you'd be busy packing for the trip to the lighthouse.

4256
04:41:53,140 --> 04:41:55,140
No, well, I'm not going with them this time.

4257
04:41:55,140 --> 04:41:57,140
I've decided to stay here.

4258
04:41:57,140 --> 04:41:59,140
Oh, dear me, really?

4259
04:41:59,140 --> 04:42:01,140
Sniff can said he was going.

4260
04:42:01,140 --> 04:42:03,140
Well, I have something very important to do.

4261
04:42:03,140 --> 04:42:04,140
Important?

4262
04:42:04,140 --> 04:42:06,140
Sniff is just a big whip, that's all.

4263
04:42:06,140 --> 04:42:08,140
Oh, shut up, little mind.

4264
04:42:08,140 --> 04:42:09,140
Don't tell me to shut up.

4265
04:42:09,140 --> 04:42:11,140
I don't listen to whims.

4266
04:42:11,140 --> 04:42:14,140
Now, now children, no squabbling.

4267
04:42:14,140 --> 04:42:16,140
It wouldn't be fair to the others.

4268
04:42:16,140 --> 04:42:18,140
I'm not a very good swimmer.

4269
04:42:18,140 --> 04:42:20,140
You mean if you fell and then we're drowning,

4270
04:42:20,140 --> 04:42:22,140
and save you, don't fall in then.

4271
04:42:22,140 --> 04:42:24,140
Anyway, you could hang on to an or something.

4272
04:42:24,140 --> 04:42:26,140
What if it got swept away?

4273
04:42:26,140 --> 04:42:29,140
We'll put a life jacket on you stupid, don't worry.

4274
04:42:29,140 --> 04:42:30,140
What about the sharks?

4275
04:42:30,140 --> 04:42:32,140
They might take a fancy to me.

4276
04:42:32,140 --> 04:42:34,140
Wait a minute, I know I'm not as�ologist,

4277
04:42:34,140 --> 04:42:36,140
but I don't think there are any sharks around here.

4278
04:42:36,140 --> 04:42:38,140
I'm sure I would have heard if there were.

4279
04:42:44,140 --> 04:42:47,140
Well, it's a real fine day for sailing.

4280
04:42:47,140 --> 04:42:50,140
Where are mama and the others?

4281
04:42:50,140 --> 04:42:53,140
Don't worry, movement, there's no hurry.

4282
04:42:53,140 --> 04:42:55,140
Are you sure that isn't too heavy for you, Sniff?

4283
04:42:55,140 --> 04:42:57,140
No, not at all, mama.

4284
04:42:57,140 --> 04:42:59,140
It's a shame that you're not coming with us,

4285
04:42:59,140 --> 04:43:01,140
but if you've got something important to do, you must do it.

4286
04:43:01,140 --> 04:43:03,140
It won't be the same without you, though.

4287
04:43:03,140 --> 04:43:05,140
We'll miss you, Sniff.

4288
04:43:05,140 --> 04:43:06,140
Thank you.

4289
04:43:06,140 --> 04:43:08,140
Oh, dear, I left a jar of strawberry jam

4290
04:43:08,140 --> 04:43:11,140
and a whole batch of pancakes on the kitchen table.

4291
04:43:11,140 --> 04:43:13,140
Do you think you could manage to eat them?

4292
04:43:13,140 --> 04:43:14,140
Leave it to me.

4293
04:43:15,140 --> 04:43:18,140
Hi, y'all be lucky if there's any food left in the lard or mama.

4294
04:43:18,140 --> 04:43:19,140
He's a my.
