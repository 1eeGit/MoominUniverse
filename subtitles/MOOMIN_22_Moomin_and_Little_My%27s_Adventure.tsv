135520	146360	About what is this it looks like movement as restless as if something has disturbed him I wonder what he was dreaming about
146360	161880	I wonder what time it is oh it nearly 20 after 2
161880	165880	I wonder whether it's morning or afternoon.
165880	168880	It doesn't really matter, I suppose.
168880	169880	Oh, it stopped.
174880	176880	Oh, it's frozen.
176880	179880	It looks really dark out there.
192880	197880	Mama, Mama, please wake up.
201880	203880	Papa, Papa.
203880	206880	Mama, Mama.
206880	209880	Mama, what's wrong with me? I feel way too weak.
222880	226880	It's very odd. I don't usually wake up when I'm hibernating.
239880	244880	Oh, dear. The whole house is buried in snow.
252880	255880	Oh, no.
256880	259880	Oh, no.
278880	282880	Oh, Papa!
282880	284880	Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
302880	305880	This doesn't look like Moomin Valley.
307880	310880	And it's so quiet.
313880	317880	What was that?
317880	321880	Perhaps I better go home.
321880	323880	No, what's the matter with me?
323880	326880	Everyone's asleep, and the furniture's all covered up,
326880	329880	and Moomin's don't give up.
329880	334880	Oh, I wish Northkin were here.
334880	339880	He's probably in the far south where it's warm and sunny.
359880	364880	I wonder what that is.
390880	393880	Oh.
393880	396880	That sounds like...
400880	403880	Oh, yes, it's little Mai.
403880	405880	By the bobble, what are you doing here, Moomin?
405880	407880	What am I doing here?
407880	409880	I heard strange noises and came to see what it was.
409880	411880	Then you crashed into me like an avalanche,
411880	413880	and I've just lifted the box off you.
413880	415880	Oh, don't be stupid, Moomin.
415880	418880	I mean, why are you out in the snow and not hibernating like the others?
418880	420880	Spring's not for ages.
420880	424880	Oh, I don't know. I just woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.
424880	428880	But what about you, sliding about like that, you should be asleep too.
428880	430880	Yes, I should, but I just woke up as well.
430880	432880	Probably to look after you.
432880	435880	I tried to wake my stupid sister, but she kept on snoring.
435880	437880	But I think this snow is really great.
437880	441880	Well, I don't. It's cold, it's slippy, much too bright,
441880	444880	and it's everywhere and far too quiet.
444880	446880	I saw the grok.
446880	450880	Wow, that horrible freezing monster.
450880	454880	She should feel at home in this, and there's no point in her trying to freeze anything.
454880	456880	I saw her on the hill.
456880	458880	Then it was her voice, I heard.
458880	460880	Yes, and the trouble with the horror thing is that she's so cold,
460880	463880	I wouldn't even want to touch her, Moomin.
463880	465880	It's her!
466880	468880	Oh!
474880	476880	I'm getting cold shivers all over.
476880	478880	Wow, why do you expect in the snow?
478880	480880	No, it's the grok's fault. She's done it.
480880	482880	Look at my skin, it's all goose bumpy.
482880	486880	It's not like that in the summer, it's smooth, not lumpy.
486880	490880	It's not the snow that makes me feel so cold, it's her staring at me.
490880	492880	I'm scared.
496880	499880	That was great.
499880	501880	Good, isn't it?
501880	503880	You can have as much as you like.
503880	505880	We picked more raspberries than ever this year,
505880	507880	and Mama made lots of juice.
507880	509880	Thanks.
509880	511880	Oh.
511880	512880	Ah!
512880	514880	I want that.
514880	516880	Mama's silver tray?
516880	517880	Yeah.
517880	518880	What do you want it for?
518880	520880	To slide on the snow with a coarse stupid.
520880	523880	But it's a sort of family treasure and heirloom.
524880	527880	Well, you never use it and it's so shiny.
527880	530880	It'll make a great sled and go really fast.
536880	539880	Doesn't look like they'll wake up till spring.
539880	541880	They're lucky, they're still sleeping.
541880	544880	I think it's very unfair that I woke up like this.
547880	549880	So, what should we do now?
549880	551880	I want to go look at the sea.
551880	552880	Good idea.
552880	554880	At least that won't be covered in snow.
568880	570880	I bet the great cold was just like this.
575880	576880	Oh no!
576880	577880	What's the matter?
577880	578880	I forgot the tray.
578880	579880	Never mind.
579880	582880	You couldn't use it as a boat anyway and it would sink.
582880	583880	Yes, you could.
583880	584880	What?
584880	585880	How?
585880	586880	Oh look!
586880	587880	There's the sink!
592880	594880	But it's all frozen.
594880	597880	So we'll be able to slide on it.
597880	599880	What's that over there?
610880	611880	Huh?
628880	629880	Huh?
629880	630880	Doe ticky!
630880	632880	Hello, you too.
634880	636880	You're not hibernating, either?
636880	640680	Oh, no. I haven't got time to spend four months sleeping.
640680	644280	Why not? Little Mayan, I just woke up and now we don't know what to do.
644280	646080	I'm sure you can think of something.
646080	647480	You suppose so?
647480	650280	I've never seen the sea frozen before.
650280	652280	Did you make that horse too, Tiki?
652280	653280	Yes, I did.
653280	654280	Can I sit on it?
654280	657680	No, you can't. I need it for the lady of the cold.
657680	659280	Oh, I see.
659280	661280	I suppose you've heard of her.
661280	665480	Yes, she's very beautiful, but if she looks into your eyes, you're turned into a block of ice.
665480	667280	She's not a very nice lady.
667280	668480	That's right, Little Mayan.
668480	670480	Spring can never come while she's here.
670480	672080	It waits for her to go.
672080	673080	Oh, I see.
673080	677480	And are you hoping she'll ride away on this horse, then?
677480	683680	Yes, and it will take her back to the north, where she stays until she comes here again next winter and drives the sun away.
683680	687280	The horse doesn't look very solid to me, Tiki.
687280	693280	Well, that's why I'm going to pour water over it when it gets really cold and then it'll be solid.
693480	695480	When is the lady of the cold coming?
695480	701480	You can never tell, but soon, tonight, perhaps, it feels much colder already.
717080	719680	What's happened to the sun, Tiki?
719680	722080	Do you know when the sun will come back again?
723080	729880	It's in the south, shining on snuffkin, but it'll be back soon, and then it will stay a bit longer each day.
729880	731080	Good, I can't wait.
731080	735280	Now, there'll be a full moon tonight, and we'll be able to see everything.
735280	736880	Great, I can get my tray up.
736880	738880	I can't wait to try it on the sea.
738880	740680	What do you mean, your tray?
740680	743080	Well, let's move in, Mama's tray, but I'm using it.
743080	746080	I'm going to put a sail on it and slide across the ice.
746080	747480	Why not wait till tomorrow?
747480	748680	Wait until tomorrow?
748680	749480	No.
749480	751680	When I want to do something, I do it now.
751680	754680	What if the ice suddenly melts or something?
759680	760680	I like it here.
760680	762080	It's warm and cozy.
762080	765280	I hope Mom and Papa doesn't mind me using it.
765280	767280	This is Papa's bathhouse.
767280	771280	He built it himself, and he'd be very glad to know you're using it.
771280	771880	It's great.
771880	773880	The window paints a different colors.
773880	778680	If you look out through one, the world is red, and through another one, the world is green.
781680	793280	Oh, you don't hibernate either, do you?
793280	797280	Now scram, the horrible lady of the cold is coming and if she looks you in the eye, you'll
797280	798280	turn to ice.
798280	799280	Go on, go away.
811680	826680	Moomin, two-tiggy, Moomin, Moomin, do-tiggy, where are you?
826680	830680	Little Mike, we're over here, huh?
830680	832680	What are you doing down there?
832680	835680	Do-tiggy's trying to catch some fish.
835680	838680	If she does, she's going to cook us some dinner.
838680	839680	Right.
839680	841480	I've got to get sailing, man.
841480	844480	I'd better go see what she's doing to Mama Silver Trey.
844480	845480	Okay.
848480	850480	Ah, got one.
856480	858480	Oh dear, me.
861480	863480	It's cold and wet under that ice.
863480	865480	How are you doing, Little Mike?
865480	866480	Very well, thank you.
868480	870480	How can you get under the ice anyway?
870480	873480	I guess the water must be low and there's a gap left there.
873480	874480	Oh, how?
874480	879480	I don't know, but perhaps the tide was in when the sea froze and some of it got stuck to the shore.
879480	882480	Oh, I suppose it's possible.
882480	887480	Do-tiggy told me that she has fish soup every day in the wintertime.
890480	891480	I know.
891480	893480	I'll go see if the horse is frozen yet.
893480	895480	Make sure you shut the door behind you.
895480	897480	Oh, my thumb!
901480	903480	I don't think it's hard enough yet.
903480	906480	It'll collapse if the lady of the cold gets on it now.
909480	912480	Oh, it's getting colder and colder.
912480	915480	Oh, it's getting colder and colder.
916480	919480	Oh, it's getting colder and colder.
941480	942480	The grog.
946480	948480	Don't tell me you want to ride the horse.
951480	953480	I don't think you'd better.
954480	956480	This is for the lady of the cold, you know.
959480	961480	There's no telling what she'd do to you.
961480	963480	Look you in the eye, probably.
976480	979480	Even the grog is frightened of the lady of the cold.
981480	983480	Ah, now it looks frozen.
987480	988480	Wee!
990480	991480	Yee-hee!
993480	994480	Wee!
999480	1001480	Great, isn't it, movement?
1001480	1003480	Yeah, that old tree really moves.
1003480	1004480	Wanna go?
1004480	1006480	No, thanks, I'm too big.
1006480	1010480	Come on, now the fish soup is ready and it's time you were inside, little my.
1010480	1012480	Keep it warm for me, I'm having another go.
1012480	1013480	No, little my.
1014480	1015480	Why not?
1015480	1018480	Have you forgotten what I told you the lady of the cold may be coming?
1018480	1019480	Oh.
1020480	1022480	Well, I want to see her, I'm not scared of her.
1022480	1024480	I'll be moving so fast she won't get a chance.
1024480	1027480	No, now listen to me, little my.
1027480	1030480	All you have to do is not let her look you in the eye.
1030480	1033480	But what happens if you're not quick enough and she catches you before you turn away?
1034480	1038480	I know, if we watch her from the bathhouse, she won't see us.
1042480	1044480	Please, little my.
1044480	1046480	Come in, she's almost here.
1046480	1048480	We can watch it from inside.
1052480	1054480	That's no good, I want to see her properly.
1054480	1055480	No, little my.
1055480	1056480	Don't go.
1057480	1059480	Don't go.
1061480	1063480	Come back, little my.
1066480	1067480	Oh dear.
1067480	1070480	Come on, let's get back in the cabin before it's too late.
1070480	1071480	Wee!
1072480	1074480	Mom, mom, mom.
1085480	1088480	Oh, the lady of the cold.
1102480	1108480	I saw her face, I saw her face.
1108480	1111480	I saw her and she didn't turn away to eye.
1114480	1116480	Press little my to get away with it.
1116480	1118480	I don't know how she does it.
1118480	1121480	I think her nerves are made of steel.
1121480	1123480	I hope she's on her face.
1123480	1125480	I saw her face, I saw her face.
1125480	1128480	I saw her and she didn't turn away to eye.
1128480	1130480	I think her nerves are made of steel.
1130480	1132480	I hope she's alright.
1132480	1135480	She should try not to make so much noise out there.
1159480	1160480	Oh, oh.
1167480	1170480	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
1170480	1172480	Oh, oh, oh.
1182480	1184480	Yeah, I know her face.
1184480	1186480	I know her face.
1186480	1188480	I know her face.
1195480	1197480	I know her face.
1200480	1202480	Oh, oh, oh.
1202480	1206480	Come on, Mom, we, oh, now just out there.
1206480	1207480	So wait a while.
1207480	1208480	This is it.
1211480	1213480	Little boy.
1222480	1229480	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
1229480	1236480	Oh, oh, oh.
1260480	1262480	Little my.
1269480	1270480	Little my.
1270480	1272480	Come on, please.
1273480	1275480	Wake up, please.
1280480	1282480	Oh, please, don't stay frozen, little my.
1282480	1283480	Don't worry, little my.
1283480	1284480	We'll thought you out.
1284480	1285480	Don't worry.
1285480	1287480	It's nice and warm here.
1289480	1291480	Let's go.
1301480	1302480	Ow!
1302480	1303480	That's hot, moment.
1303480	1305480	Praise the bull, Bob.
1305480	1306480	You come back.
1310480	1312480	So little my came back from the cold.
1312480	1314480	Little the worse for where.
1314480	1316480	The movement need not have worried.
1316480	1320480	For the little mysers world are practically indestructible.
1325480	1332480	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1332480	1339480	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1340480	1344480	They're always happy and always at play.
1344480	1347480	The movements are having fun day after day.
1347480	1351480	The movements.
1351480	1355480	The movements.
1355480	1362480	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1362480	1368480	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1369480	1373480	They're always happy and always at play.
1373480	1377480	The movements are having fun day after day.
1377480	1380480	The movements.
1380480	1384480	The movements.
1384480	1390480	The movements.
