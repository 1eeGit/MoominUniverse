00:00.000 --> 00:20.920

00:20.920 --> 00:30.800

00:30.800 --> 00:37.600

00:37.600 --> 00:45.000
like a bird sing that song ever there were the movements there were the

00:45.000 --> 00:59.280
movements there were the movements there was the movements there was the movements

01:15.000 --> 01:44.760
The rain was falling on Moomin Valley as though the heavens had decided to empty

01:44.760 --> 01:55.240
themselves. It was the wettest weather that anyone could remember.

02:14.760 --> 02:39.160
Mama, can I borrow all this?

02:39.160 --> 02:46.760
Of course, dear.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.280
And this one too?

02:48.280 --> 02:50.840
Yes, dear, but what do you need them for?

02:50.840 --> 02:52.760
It's a secret. A secret?

02:52.760 --> 02:53.720
Yeah, sure.

02:53.720 --> 02:57.320
I'll want to see a back moment, but you can keep the jar if you like.

02:57.320 --> 03:05.560
Thanks.

03:09.160 --> 03:23.320
Oh, dear, oh, there are puddles everywhere.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.760
Oh, dear, Mr. Hemmielen, what a mess.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.760
Hello, Mr. Hemmielen.

03:28.760 --> 03:33.480
Oh, good morning, Moomin.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.880
Oh, it's all misty now.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.480
What are you doing, Moomin?

03:38.880 --> 03:40.800
Observing very closely.

03:40.800 --> 03:45.040
Oh, splendid, my boy. I'm glad you find botany so exciting.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.520
Oh, what exactly is it you're observing?

03:47.520 --> 03:50.720
I'm sure I saw a beautiful crayfish in there.

03:50.720 --> 03:54.240
Crayfish? Excuse me, young man, but that is the wallets.

03:54.240 --> 04:13.920
Is he quite the most un-interesting field?

04:13.920 --> 04:17.920
Oh, there it is.

04:24.240 --> 04:54.240
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

04:54.240 --> 05:08.120
Ahahahaha. I got him, I got him. I got him.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.120
Oh, dragon.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.120
Mm-hmm.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.120
Mm-hmm.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.120
Papa!

05:20.120 --> 05:22.120
Oh, what have you got?

05:22.120 --> 05:24.120
I don't know.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.120
I don't know.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.120
I don't know.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.120
I don't know.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.120
Papa!

05:32.120 --> 05:34.120
Oh, what have you got?

05:34.120 --> 05:36.120
I don't know.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.120
Oh, what have you got there?

05:38.120 --> 05:40.120
Oh, oh, nothing, Papa.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.120
Everything's so fresh after the rain.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.120
Oh, woman.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.120
Yes, it is.

05:48.120 --> 05:52.120
I've got to show this to Snuffkin before anybody else sees it.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.120
Mm-hmm.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.120
Mm-hmm.

05:56.120 --> 05:58.120
Mm-hmm.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.120
Mm-hmm.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.120
Oh.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.120
Mm-hmm.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.120
Mm-hmm.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.120
Boom, woman.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.120
Boom, woman.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.120
What have you got there, woman?

06:16.120 --> 06:18.120
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all, little lie.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.120
Oh, yes, you have, I saw it.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.120
Lie to me.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.120
It's just one of Mama's old jars.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.120
Liar, liar, I know there's something.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.120
I don't think there's nothing.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.120
Then why are you hiding it?

06:32.120 --> 06:36.120
Oh, why did a little mice see me?

06:36.120 --> 06:38.120
It's not fair.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.120
Dragon.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.120
Oh, yeah, I was right.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.120
It must be a baby dragon.

06:50.120 --> 06:54.120
Probably the very last one on Earth and washed up by the rain.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.120
A dragon of my own.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.120
Well, that's wonderful.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.120
Oh, I hope I didn't frighten you.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.120
I know what I'll do.

07:06.120 --> 07:10.120
I'll take the lid off the jar so you can get some fresh hair, little dragon.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.120
See? That's better, isn't it?

07:16.120 --> 07:18.120
Come on, little fella.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.120
We'll give you a car to make you feel better.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.120
Oh, that burnt me.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.120
What a fierce little dragon you are.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.120
Don't worry. I'll look after you.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.120
I'll take good care of you.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.120
And when your bigger and start to like me,

07:36.120 --> 07:38.120
I'll take you swimming in the sea.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.120
Oh, I'm sorry. You must be starring.

07:44.120 --> 07:48.120
I'll get you something from my nighttime emergency food box.

07:48.120 --> 07:50.120
I've got lots of things in there.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.120
Bound to be something you like.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.120
Go on. Take anything you want.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.120
Oh.

08:26.120 --> 08:30.120
Gosh, that's really clever, little dragon.

08:30.120 --> 08:34.120
Move in. Lunch is ready.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.120
Coming!

08:36.120 --> 08:38.120
Now you stay here. Don't worry.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.120
I'll be back in no time at all.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.120
Remember, you're my own little dragon.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.120
Oh.

08:50.120 --> 08:54.120
Where's Sniff? I thought he was here as well.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.120
He's collecting worms for fishing.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.120
He'll be here soon.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.120
We'll start without him then.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.120
You know, Mama, certain people keep secrets in glass jars.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.120
Secrets?

09:06.120 --> 09:10.120
Oh, yes, a little secret that hisses.

09:10.120 --> 09:14.120
Moment, Mama, I found this near the big puddle.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.120
Thank you, Sniff.

09:16.120 --> 09:20.120
Moment, I told you I wanted it back.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.120
It's my very best one.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.120
Sorry, Mama. I was so excited.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.120
I must have left it when I found...

09:26.120 --> 09:28.120
I mean, when I was...

09:28.120 --> 09:30.120
And I'm sure you know who I mean by certain people.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.120
Did you catch anything with the sieve, Moment?

09:32.120 --> 09:34.120
Yes, he did.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.120
Something that's now hidden in his room.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.120
Big mouth.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.120
If it's a secret little my.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.120
Perhaps he doesn't want to tell anyone.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.120
Yeah, probably because his new pet bites.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.120
Well, it hasn't bitten you yet, hasn't it?

09:46.120 --> 09:48.120
Huh. If it did, I'd bite it back.

09:48.120 --> 09:52.120
Is it true? Does your secret really bite people?

09:52.120 --> 09:54.120
Well, it couldn't bite very hard.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.120
If it was small enough to go in a jar, could it, Papa?

09:56.120 --> 10:00.120
I suppose certain people might keep other small things in jars,

10:00.120 --> 10:04.120
beetles and spiders, mosquitoes, scorpions, or poisonous centipedes,

10:04.120 --> 10:06.120
horrible things that multiply and multiply every week

10:06.120 --> 10:10.120
and grow and grow until the jars are too small.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.120
See? Like that.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.120
And there'll be so many of them, thousands and thousands

10:16.120 --> 10:20.120
and they'll take over moving valley and eat us all.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.120
Oh, well, I haven't got a centipede.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.120
Hmm. I wonder if centipedes come from out of space.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.120
But this is the Earth's deer.

10:26.120 --> 10:30.120
The rain could have brought them down from space, Mama, couldn't it?

10:30.120 --> 10:32.120
Well, you could be right.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.120
It was raining very hard yesterday.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.120
And it wasn't like ordinary rain.

10:36.120 --> 10:40.120
I saw a puddle as big as a lake.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.120
What's the matter, Moomin?

10:44.120 --> 10:46.120
It isn't a centipede.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.120
Huh. We're on the right track, though.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.120
Well, I'm glad it's not a poisonous centipede.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.120
I shouldn't have liked that.

11:00.120 --> 11:06.120
Oh, you're asleep. Moomin's little dragon.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.120
Is it okay if I go see Snuffkin, Mama?

11:12.120 --> 11:14.120
Have you finished already?

11:14.120 --> 11:16.120
Yes, I have.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.120
Tell them they mustn't go into my room.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.120
Or they'll have to take the consequence, sis.

11:20.120 --> 11:24.120
All right, Moomin. I'll make sure no one goes in there.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.120
I promise.

11:26.120 --> 11:30.120
Oh, but he's going to tell Snuffkin the secret.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.120
I should think he is.

11:32.120 --> 11:36.120
Best friends always come first, little Mai.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.120
Hey, Snuffkin!

11:54.120 --> 11:56.120
Hey, Snuffkin!

11:56.120 --> 11:58.120
Hi.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.120
Fishing again?

12:00.120 --> 12:04.120
Yep. The cards told me that if I caught five minutes, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south.

12:04.120 --> 12:06.120
South?

12:06.120 --> 12:08.120
You're joking.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.120
Not at all. I believe in the cards.

12:10.120 --> 12:14.120
But Snuffkin, winter's not here yet.

12:14.120 --> 12:18.120
I know that. But the cards tell you things for a reason, Moomin.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.120
Do they really?

12:20.120 --> 12:22.120
But it would be awfully few anyway, Snuffkin.

12:22.120 --> 12:25.120
It's just awful. I mean, I'd be very lonely.

12:25.120 --> 12:28.120
And anyway, who would I talk to, or tell my secrets to?

12:31.120 --> 12:35.120
Oh, Snuffkin, quickly. You must come up to Moomin House.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.120
Now?

12:36.120 --> 12:37.120
Yeah.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.120
Well, I suppose I could fish later.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.120
No, no. There's no point.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.120
But I have to catch five minutes.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.120
Oh.

12:44.120 --> 12:47.120
The fish won't bite after all is rain. You'd catch nothing.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.120
It'll be better to wait until it stops flowing so fast.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.120
Well, perhaps you're right.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.120
So what's this big secret all about?

12:54.120 --> 12:56.120
Hey, Moomin.

12:56.120 --> 12:59.120
Have you ever seen a dragon Snuffkin?

12:59.120 --> 13:01.120
No, of course not.

13:01.120 --> 13:05.120
They all disappeared off the face of the earth many hundreds of years ago.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.120
But perhaps they didn't all disappear.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.120
What if there was one alive somewhere?

13:10.120 --> 13:12.120
That's impossible.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.120
It could be so small that it would go in a glass jar Snuffkin.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.120
Are you sure you're not daydreaming Moomin?

13:17.120 --> 13:20.120
But still, anything is possible, I suppose.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.120
But you know me.

13:21.120 --> 13:24.120
I have to see it right in front of me before I believe it.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.120
Oh, where is it?

13:31.120 --> 13:34.120
Mama promised me that she wouldn't let anyone in.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.120
It's not here either.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.120
Well, you were right, Moomin.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.120
What?

13:48.120 --> 13:50.120
Ah, there he is.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.120
I think you've found a real dragon.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.120
How do you get up there?

13:54.120 --> 13:56.120
He mustn't fall. He might lose his tail.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.120
Don't move, little dragon.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.120
And Snuffkin, keep quiet.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.120
He might get frightened and do something silly.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.120
Don't worry. I'll soon have you down.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.120
This will do. I'll lay it on the floor here.

14:06.120 --> 14:09.120
Jump, little dragon. Don't be afraid.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.120
Come on. Hold on to this.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.120
It will bring you down slowly.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.120
Don't panic.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.120
I don't think it's a very good idea, Moomin.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.120
You'll only scare him away.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.120
Why don't you just leave him alone?

14:22.120 --> 14:24.120
He'll come down when he's ready.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.120
Dragons aren't helpless, you know, even little baby ones.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.120
But he's so small.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.120
Come to Moomin.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.120
Come on. Don't you understand?

14:32.120 --> 14:34.120
Hold onto that and I'll listen to that.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.120
Ah!

14:35.120 --> 14:36.120
Ah!

14:38.120 --> 14:39.120
Ah!

14:43.120 --> 14:44.120
Ah!

14:46.120 --> 14:47.120
Look at him.

14:47.120 --> 14:51.120
My dragon can fly. He's flying. He's flying.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.120
Come down, little dragon.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.120
You might question or something. Come down.

14:57.120 --> 15:01.120
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

15:04.120 --> 15:07.120
Be careful, Snuffkin. He might bite.

15:07.120 --> 15:10.120
I don't think so. He's a very unusual pet.

15:10.120 --> 15:13.120
I think he'll like you more than me.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.120
Ah!

15:16.120 --> 15:20.120
What a charming little creature movements.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.120
I think he'll like you more than me.

15:24.120 --> 15:28.120
I think he'll like you more than me.

15:31.120 --> 15:34.120
I think he'll like you more than me.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.120
What a charming little creature, Moomin.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.120
He's lovely. What's his name?

15:39.120 --> 15:41.120
He's called Little Dragon.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.120
Huh. I don't think he's lovely at all.

15:43.120 --> 15:46.120
Small but savage, if you ask my opinion.

15:46.120 --> 15:48.120
That sounds just like you, little mind.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.120
You think so?

15:50.120 --> 15:51.120
Ow!

15:53.120 --> 15:56.120
No, oh, oh, oh.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.120
Whoa!

15:58.120 --> 15:59.120
Ow!

15:59.120 --> 16:00.120
Now look here.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.120
Ah!

16:04.120 --> 16:07.120
He seems to have a thing about ears, doesn't he?

16:07.120 --> 16:09.120
Steps Snuffkins, why doesn't he bite him?

16:09.120 --> 16:11.120
Go on, Dragon.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.120
Go on, Vitamy's really tasty, go on!

16:15.120 --> 16:19.120
Good news, I think he's trying to heat up Snuffkins coffee.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.120
He must really like him.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.120
Clever little thing.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.120
Well, I hope he's careful with that hot breath.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.120
We don't want to start a fire.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.120
All right, that's enough.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.120
He might be useful.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.120
When he's bigger, we can put him in the cellar

16:36.120 --> 16:39.120
and he'll be able to heat the whole house just like a furnace.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.120
No, we will not.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.120
Huh?

16:49.120 --> 16:51.120
Go away! You passed!

16:53.120 --> 16:55.120
Ow!

16:56.120 --> 16:57.120
And you!

16:57.120 --> 17:00.120
He only thought you were trying to get his flood.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.120
I'll get him if he bites me again.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.120
Just you watch me do it.

17:04.120 --> 17:06.120
Come on, little dragon.

17:20.120 --> 17:22.120
I'm sure that'll keep him quiet.

17:22.120 --> 17:23.120
I'd better go.

17:23.120 --> 17:25.120
Thanks for the coffee, Mumma.

17:27.120 --> 17:30.120
Oh no, it'll suffocate him.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.120
He only seems to like Snuffkin.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.120
Well, we all like Snuffkin.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.120
Stupid old dragon.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.120
No, he isn't.

18:07.120 --> 18:11.120
Mum and dear, why don't you take him to your room?

18:11.120 --> 18:13.120
He'll be happier there.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.120
This will be best for him.

18:20.120 --> 18:23.120
Oh, I wonder if he'll come back to visit us.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.120
Why did you do that?

18:24.120 --> 18:27.120
He was cute and we could have always worn earmuffs.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.120
You can visit him in Snuffkin's tent.

18:29.120 --> 18:32.120
I expect little dragons already sitting on his shoulder.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.120
It doesn't matter anyway.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.120
Snuffkin's going south soup.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.120
They'll be able to go together.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.120
Oh, my dear, Mumma.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.120
Never mind.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.120
Well, you're a bit of a problem.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.120
I don't want you here, little dragon.

18:51.120 --> 18:54.120
Go on, go away. Go to Mumma.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.120
Don't do that.

18:56.120 --> 18:58.120
Oh, come on, please go to Mumma.

18:58.120 --> 19:02.120
Look, you're very nice and it'll be fun to have you along.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.120
But there's Mumma.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.120
And he'd know you were here and you'd be upset.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.120
Oh, there's another one.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.120
That's the fifth.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.120
Oh, dear.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.120
Hmm?

19:27.120 --> 19:28.120
Any luck?

19:28.120 --> 19:29.120
Not bad.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.120
Are you going far?

19:31.120 --> 19:33.120
Oh, I'm fair away.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.120
Would you like some fresh fish?

19:35.120 --> 19:37.120
I'm sure you'll get hungry.

19:39.120 --> 19:42.120
Yeah, what do you want in return?

19:42.120 --> 19:44.120
A small favor.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.120
Take this as far as you can.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.120
Open the lid and just leave it.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.120
What? Just leave it?

19:58.120 --> 20:00.120
Yes, in a nice quiet place.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.120
With lots and lots of flies.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.120
Flies? What's in there?

20:04.120 --> 20:05.120
A dragon.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.120
A dragon, does it bite?

20:07.120 --> 20:08.120
Well, it might.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.120
This is a big favor.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.120
I don't even like minnows.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.120
Oh, they're not too bad if you roast them.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.120
Keep the lid on.

20:16.120 --> 20:19.120
But make sure you open it up later so it can catch the flies.

20:19.120 --> 20:22.120
All right, as long as it doesn't try to bite me.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.120
Don't worry, it won't.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.120
Hello.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.120
Hi.

20:38.120 --> 20:41.120
Oh, well, where is he?

20:41.120 --> 20:42.120
Who is that?

20:42.120 --> 20:43.120
My dragon.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.120
He must have come here, Snuffkin.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.120
Oh, really?

20:46.120 --> 20:49.120
I thought he was home with you, sleeping in your room.

20:49.120 --> 20:52.120
No, I let him out.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.120
Ah, well, dragons are very fickle.

20:54.120 --> 20:57.120
All they really care about is big fat flies.

20:57.120 --> 21:00.120
It's best to forget about a moment.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.120
Did you catch your five minnows?

21:04.120 --> 21:06.120
No, you were right.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.120
The water is too fast.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.120
Oh, really?

21:09.120 --> 21:11.120
So I won't go soft until winter comes.

21:11.120 --> 21:13.120
You'll stay here then?

21:13.120 --> 21:16.120
Well, I'm sure it wouldn't do to go against the cards.

21:16.120 --> 21:18.120
Now what a moment, my friend.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.120
Oh, that's great.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.120
You're staying, Snuffkin.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.120
That's fantastic.

21:22.120 --> 21:25.120
That's really, really good.

21:25.120 --> 21:28.120
Ah, perhaps I shouldn't have painted the float bright red.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.120
It might have scared those little minnows right away.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.120
Okay, let's go.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.120
Yeah.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.120
That dragon was sort of stupid.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.120
Baby dragons are.

21:40.120 --> 21:42.120
They make the world's worst pets.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.120
They never want to settle in one place.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.120
Yeah, you're right.

21:46.120 --> 21:49.120
It was very funny, though, when it bit little mice here.

21:49.120 --> 21:52.120
I think it gave her a taste of her own medicine.

21:53.120 --> 21:57.120
The woman was very happy that Snuffkin was staying in Moomin Valley

21:57.120 --> 22:00.120
and not going south until winter.

22:00.120 --> 22:06.120
And as for the dragon, well, who wants to be loved by a silly old dragon?

22:06.120 --> 22:13.120
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:13.120 --> 22:20.120
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:20.120 --> 22:24.120
They're always happy and always at play.

22:24.120 --> 22:28.120
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.120
The movements.

22:31.120 --> 22:35.120
The movements.

22:35.120 --> 22:42.120
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:42.120 --> 22:49.120
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:49.120 --> 22:53.120
They're always happy and always at play.

22:53.120 --> 22:57.120
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:57.120 --> 23:00.120
The movements.

23:00.120 --> 23:04.120
The movements.

23:04.120 --> 23:11.120
The movements.
