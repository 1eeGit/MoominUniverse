77
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:52,740
we've had some very strange people staying at our house but I think these two are really weird

78
00:11:53,700 --> 00:12:00,180
well they're northerners I guess so with names like thingamy and bob and that suitcase

79
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:07,940
they look a lot like fugitives to me snuff kin and perhaps they're dangerous criminals on the run

80
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,020
do you want to see them yeah I wouldn't mind movement

81
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:32,740
