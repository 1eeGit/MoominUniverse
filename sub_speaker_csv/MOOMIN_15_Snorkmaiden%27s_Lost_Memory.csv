29000,35000,"So come with me. Give me your hand. I'll take you up to a movement land.",26700,28200,"SPEAKER_02"
35000,43000,"You can fly just like a bird. Sing that song ever. There were the movements.",29600,42600,"SPEAKER_02"
43000,58000,"There were the movements. There were the movements. There were the movements.",29600,42600,"SPEAKER_02"

93000,108000,"For a whole week, snorkemaiden had been curled up on the sofa, reading fairy tales.",85600,90500,"SPEAKER_01"
108000,119000,"It's a lovely day and at last, movement is persuaded to come out for a walk in the lonely mountains.",104200,108000,"SPEAKER_00"
119000,130000,"Oh, it's beautiful up here. Aren't you glad you came now? This is much better than fairy tales, isn't it snorkemaiden?",108500,114500,"SPEAKER_00"
130000,141000,"Oh, look, movement. It's Adelvice. No, it isn't. That doesn't grow here at all.",126100,129400,"SPEAKER_10"
141000,147000,"I'm sure it is. I know what it looks like. I'm sorry, but it's not.",138500,141300,"SPEAKER_10"
147000,155000,"Oh, it's just like in Heidi. No, it's not. It's just a daisy. Oh, come on. I want to pick it.",142000,146100,"SPEAKER_10"
155000,162000,"Oh, no, it's too dangerous. I know then. You can do it. You're my boyfriend, aren't you, movement?",151000,155100,"SPEAKER_10"
163000,171000,"Well, I suppose we could climb down there, but I promise you it's not Adelvice. That only grows in the Alps and there are hundreds of miles away.",162900,170700,"SPEAKER_10"
171000,189000,"I know it's Adelvice. Be careful. They don't care about danger in fairy tales. That's why they call them fairy tales, silly.",170900,172600,"SPEAKER_10"
189000,193000,"Fairy Princess, please accept this, my humble offering.",177400,183600,"SPEAKER_10"
193000,199000,"Thank you, Brave Knight. You are right, movement. This isn't Adelvice. See, I told you...",189300,192700,"SPEAKER_10"
199000,205000,"It's gonna be hard to get down from here, you know? Can't we go back the way we came?",193200,199100,"SPEAKER_10"
205000,213000,"Well, I think it'll be easier to try to get to that path. If you say so...",202700,204600,"SPEAKER_10"
214000,222000,"It's nearer anyway, and better than going up. I'm surprised you're such a good climber.",212600,213000,"SPEAKER_10"
222000,225000,"Oh, Royalty is good at practically everything.",218400,220500,"SPEAKER_10"

264000,270000,"Well, nothing of interest to me. Now, where was I?",259500,267600,"SPEAKER_11"
270000,274000,"We start hemulating. Has Snorkmaiden just gone past you?",259500,267600,"SPEAKER_11"
274000,278000,"Snorkmaiden, no, I've seen going past. It's a very large snowball.",272200,274100,"SPEAKER_10"
278000,280000,"That was Snorkmaiden.",274100,278100,"SPEAKER_11"
280000,284000,"But she's not made of snow?",278100,279600,"SPEAKER_10"
284000,288000,"Stop! Snorkmaiden, stop!",282700,283000,"SPEAKER_06"
295000,305000,"Snorkmaiden, snorkmaiden!",284400,286500,"SPEAKER_06"
305000,312000,"Oh, I'll praise the boobah. She's still breathing. She's just knocked herself out.",302900,304800,"SPEAKER_10"
318000,320000,"Oh, Mum and what's happened to her?",314900,315100,"SPEAKER_11"
320000,322000,"She's unconscious.",318100,320300,"SPEAKER_11"
322000,324000,"What are you trying to do?",320500,322700,"SPEAKER_11"
324000,327000,"I want to get her home to Mama.",322900,326500,"SPEAKER_11"
327000,330000,"Oh, difficult. She should lose a bit of weight.",322900,326500,"SPEAKER_11"
330000,335000,"Perhaps she'd come around if we splashed cold water on her face.",327500,332400,"SPEAKER_11"
335000,338000,"Oh, there's nothing to fetch it in.",332500,335200,"SPEAKER_11"
338000,344000,"Ah, if you cut some bark off a tree trunk, you could make a small container.",336000,337700,"SPEAKER_10"
344000,348000,"What a good idea. If you stay here, I'll go and do that.",339200,343600,"SPEAKER_11"
351000,353000,"Wake up, Snorkmaiden.",344500,347400,"SPEAKER_10"
366000,368000,"Oh, that's cold.",365700,366000,"SPEAKER_10"

402000,404000,"What? A Princess?",398400,402000,"SPEAKER_10"
405000,407000,"Oh, yes, of course.",402900,406600,"SPEAKER_10"
409000,410000,"And who are you?",409000,410100,"SPEAKER_10"
410000,413000,"I am the Prince of Lonely Mountains.",409000,410100,"SPEAKER_10"

415000,417000,"With that ridiculous shape?",410300,416300,"SPEAKER_10"
417000,419000,"No, a gesture, perhaps.",410300,416300,"SPEAKER_10"

422000,425000,"You there. Do not laugh.",417400,420600,"SPEAKER_10"
434000,437000,"I think the poor girl must have lost her memory.",426600,427000,"SPEAKER_10"
437000,440000,"Of course not. She's just pretending.",434100,437000,"SPEAKER_11"
441000,445000,"When does not whisper with royalty present, do you hear?",437800,440000,"SPEAKER_10"
445000,447000,"So sorry, Royal Highness.",441200,444700,"SPEAKER_10"
450000,453000,"A poor crafters cabin.",445200,447100,"SPEAKER_10"
453000,455000,"This is your castle, ma'am.",450900,452300,"SPEAKER_10"
455000,457000,"Royalty doesn't live in shacks.",453500,458800,"SPEAKER_10"
457000,461000,"Snorkmaiden, stop calling us that.",453500,458800,"SPEAKER_10"
461000,463000,"It's very rude.",459500,462500,"SPEAKER_10"
463000,465000,"Oh, forgive me.",459500,462500,"SPEAKER_10"
465000,467000,"A royal castle is elsewhere.",463200,464500,"SPEAKER_10"
467000,468000,"Is it not?",465300,469300,"SPEAKER_10"
468000,469000,"What?",465300,469300,"SPEAKER_10"
469000,471000,"That must be hunting lodge.",465300,469300,"SPEAKER_10"
471000,474000,"No, of course, that's what it is.",469800,473900,"SPEAKER_10"

502000,504000,"My good man.",501700,503600,"SPEAKER_04"
509000,512000,"Papa, have you seen Snorkmaiden?",501700,503600,"SPEAKER_04"
512000,514000,"Yes, up there.",509400,511400,"SPEAKER_10"

524000,525000,"Oh, no.",522300,528500,"SPEAKER_10"
525000,527000,"It's just that she fell and banged her head.",522300,528500,"SPEAKER_10"
527000,529000,"And now she thinks she's a royal princess.",522300,528500,"SPEAKER_10"

562000,563000,"I wish you, Mama.",562000,563100,"SPEAKER_07"
563000,565000,"All right, I'm sure.",562000,563100,"SPEAKER_07"
565000,567000,"But she seems convinced she's a princess.",563500,571000,"SPEAKER_07"
567000,569000,"Sounds as if it's dangerous, doesn't it, Mama?",563500,571000,"SPEAKER_07"
569000,571000,"Oh, I don't think so.",563500,571000,"SPEAKER_07"
571000,574000,"I was only joking when I called her a princess.",563500,571000,"SPEAKER_07"
574000,576000,"I'm very glad you didn't call her an opera singer.",571300,573900,"SPEAKER_10"
576000,578000,"Is Snorkmaiden asleep now?",574200,576500,"SPEAKER_04"

583000,586000,"And another thing, Boomin, she wants a canopy put up immediately.",578800,586200,"SPEAKER_07"
586000,587000,"What's that?",578800,586200,"SPEAKER_07"
587000,593000,"Oh, a fancy cover over the bed that's draped in silks, envelopes, and tassels.",586400,587200,"SPEAKER_07"
593000,597000,"Oh, she was very upset because there wasn't one there already.",592600,596400,"SPEAKER_07"
597000,599000,"It might be necessary.",596900,605000,"SPEAKER_11"
599000,601000,"Her memory could have come back by the time she wakes up.",596900,605000,"SPEAKER_11"
601000,603000,"Why don't we wait and see?",596900,605000,"SPEAKER_11"
603000,605000,"She might be fine after a rest.",596900,605000,"SPEAKER_11"
605000,607000,"I sure hope so.",605000,605000,"SPEAKER_08"
605000,607000,"I sure hope so.",605000,606300,"SPEAKER_10"
607000,610000,"But what do we do if it hasn't come back?",605000,605000,"SPEAKER_08"
607000,610000,"But what do we do if it hasn't come back?",605000,606300,"SPEAKER_10"
610000,612000,"Let's think about that if it happens.",607300,609400,"SPEAKER_10"
612000,614000,"We might not have to build that canopy.",610300,614300,"SPEAKER_07"
614000,616000,"Let me try it.",610300,614300,"SPEAKER_07"
616000,617000,"Try what?",614900,616600,"SPEAKER_08"
617000,619000,"To get Snorkmaiden's memory back, what else?",616900,619400,"SPEAKER_08"
619000,620000,"Oh, how?",616900,619400,"SPEAKER_08"
620000,623000,"Well, I think that if she sees me, she'll remember me",619400,619400,"SPEAKER_07"
623000,625000,"and then she'll remember everything else too.",620400,624400,"SPEAKER_08"
625000,627000,"Don't be silly little Mai.",624400,629900,"SPEAKER_10"
627000,630000,"If she doesn't remember me, why should you remember you, eh?",624400,629900,"SPEAKER_10"
630000,633000,"Simple, because I'm unforgettable.",624400,629900,"SPEAKER_10"
633000,635000,"There is that, I suppose.",630600,632500,"SPEAKER_10"
637000,642000,"She's still fast asleep.",633400,635100,"SPEAKER_10"
642000,645000,"Well, I'm glad we made the canopy anyway.",641100,642600,"SPEAKER_10"
645000,648000,"It looks really great, doesn't it?",643100,647100,"SPEAKER_10"
648000,650000,"Oh, oh, look.",643100,647100,"SPEAKER_10"
650000,654000,"She's opening her eyes.",650000,652100,"SPEAKER_10"
654000,656000,"Are you awake?",650000,652100,"SPEAKER_10"

658000,660000,"Let's go down to the beach.",656500,658300,"SPEAKER_08"
660000,662000,"And who is that person?",658400,659800,"SPEAKER_08"
662000,663000,"Come on.",660100,661500,"SPEAKER_10"
663000,664000,"You remember me.",662700,666200,"SPEAKER_08"
664000,666000,"I warn you if you know you'll be sorry.",662700,666200,"SPEAKER_08"
667000,669000,"Oh, quite amusing.",666600,668600,"SPEAKER_09"
669000,671000,"Ah, so you remember me now.",668900,670500,"SPEAKER_08"
671000,672000,"Of course we do.",670800,672100,"SPEAKER_09"
672000,674000,"There you are, I told you.",670800,672100,"SPEAKER_09"
674000,675000,"Who am I then?",674000,675200,"SPEAKER_08"
675000,678000,"Well, you're another court jester.",674000,675200,"SPEAKER_08"
678000,679000,"Of course.",675600,678500,"SPEAKER_09"
679000,684000,"Ah, don't be little Mai.",675600,678500,"SPEAKER_09"
684000,687000,"A court jester.",682500,685300,"SPEAKER_10"
687000,689000,"Oh, very funny.",682500,685300,"SPEAKER_10"
689000,691000,"She's a better clown than the other one.",687800,693000,"SPEAKER_09"
692000,694000,"You can perform it our wedding.",687800,693000,"SPEAKER_09"
694000,697000,"You are a wedding.",693900,695000,"SPEAKER_09"
701000,703000,"I'm stinky.",700300,708700,"SPEAKER_12"
703000,705000,"What are you doing here?",700300,708700,"SPEAKER_12"
705000,708500,"I'm stinky.",700300,708700,"SPEAKER_12"
708500,712000,"What are you doing here?",708000,708000,"SPEAKER_06"
712000,725000,"Moment asked me to come over to Moment House and propose to some princess.",711000,712400,"SPEAKER_12"
725000,727000,"Moments lost his marbles as well then.",717000,724400,"SPEAKER_11"
727000,729000,"I think he wanted stinky as a contrast.",725200,727500,"SPEAKER_11"
729000,730000,"You what?",727600,729700,"SPEAKER_05"
730000,734000,"You mean to tell me you're both my rivals for the hands of the royal princess?",729700,730500,"SPEAKER_11"
735000,737000,"Well, it's not very original.",731100,735100,"SPEAKER_11"
737000,742000,"But in order to win the princess and have her kingdom stinky, you'll need to saw three riddles.",735200,742500,"SPEAKER_05"
742000,746000,"Hey, that's great! What's this kingdom like?",735200,742500,"SPEAKER_05"
