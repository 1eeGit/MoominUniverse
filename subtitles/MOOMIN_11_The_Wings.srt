1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you are your TV, there are the movements, there are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:58,000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:46,000
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Snort Maiden is running as if the groke is chasing her. I don't think I've ever seen her run so fast. I wonder what's the matter? Perhaps something terrible has happened.

8
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now come down and tell us what's wrong. My brother's on the cliff and then he's about to jump off. What snort? Are you sure? He says nothing will prevent him doing it. Oh, police, you must stop him, moment. Did you say that you wanted me to help you with something snort Maiden? Yes, I want you to stop snort jumping off the cell side of the cliff. Oh dear, I never thought he was the type. He says it's a test flight.

9
00:02:46,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh. Now what? A test flight, did you say? Snort Maiden, do you mean that he's finally finished building his flying ship? No, only the blueprint. At least I think that's all. He doesn't tell me. Well, that's a start. He built a small model of the flying ship's wings and they don't look strong enough to carry anyone. And now he's going to try them out himself to see if they'll work. And I know they won't. They'll break, you know. Now wait a minute, Snort Maiden. Slow down and let me think.

10
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He's made the wings from the blueprint of the flying ship. Well, his plans are always very accurate. Oh, Papa, you've got to stop him. The cell side, Papa. Yes, I know the highest and steepest one of all. Oh, moment, Papa, there must be something we can do. Yes, I'm sure there is. Right. Hurry, everybody. There's no time to lose. Come on. Oh, thank you, moment, Papa.

11
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
â€¦No! Go!

12
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:33,000
A snork? Wait! Wait! Please! Stop snork, don't do it! Why have you brought everybody

13
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
here, snork maiden? They've come to beg you not to do it. You're too young and brilliant

14
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
for such a tragic end. Thank the bubble we were in time. As a matter of fact, you weren't.

15
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh, really? It looks very dangerous to me, snork. Well, it's not at all moving, Papa. I made these wings

16
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,000
myself. They're perfectly balanced. Well, yes, I'm sure they are. The blueprints are detailed and precise. They're quite safe.

17
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Tell me, snork. Why did you stop on the edge like that after running down the slope?

18
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I was measuring the right length from my approach run. Don't do it, snork. I don't want to lose my only brother.

19
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Don't make such a fuss, snork maiden. Do you really think it's safe? Of course it is. You don't see birds falling out of the sky, do you?

20
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, at least do your test flight just above the ground so that if something happens to go wrong, you'll hurt yourself.

21
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I've already done that from the roof of our house and it worked beautifully. Did you see him? No, I didn't see anything.

22
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Of course you didn't. Do you think I let a wimpy little sister watch me? What's that supposed to mean, snork?

23
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Just that I don't want you sticking your big nose into my affairs all the time. I don't like it, and there's nothing to do with you.

24
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yours is just as big and I don't want to lose you. Don't go on about losing me. Why not?

25
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Come on now, you two. Stop it.

26
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hey! Oops! That was close. Snork maiden, I don't think your brother is going to be stopped.

27
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh dear, oh dear. You're very brave, snork.

28
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hmm, right. Here we go. This time it'll be a perfect takeoff.

29
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's a long way. Oh look, isn't that snuffkin down there?

30
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Where? Where is he? Where is snuffkin?

31
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You can't see him from there, Sniff. You'll have to come here.

32
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is it really snuffkin? Yes, I'm sure it is. Snuffkin!

33
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah! Baby, here you...

34
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No, I don't think so.

35
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
All right, here goes! Good luck, snork!

36
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
All right.

37
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He's flying!

38
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's the snork!

39
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Look at him flying.

40
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's all right, snork maiden. Your brother's doing fine. Come and see.

41
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He's done it! He's done it!

42
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Wow, I know he could do it. Well, so did I, to be honest.

43
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Huh? Yeah, snork!

44
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Hello!

45
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Hi! How are you doing?

46
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's great that this test flight is a great success.

47
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay, just as I thought he can't fly and wave at the same time.

48
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Interesting. That was mean, stinky.

49
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If I could get him to wave with both arms, you'd probably fall.

50
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Look, we don't want you here, stinky. Why don't you just go away?

51
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I can find lots to do with that machine.

52
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If you won't go away, I will.

53
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Well, go on then, Snuffkin. What do I care what you do?

54
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Hmm, that would be perfect for robberies.

55
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The wind seems to be taking him out to sea.

56
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Why doesn't he turn around and come back?

57
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Turning in that thing might not be so easy.

58
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What? Do you mean he can't?

59
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, don't worry, snork maiden. Of course he can.

60
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, what's this I can't turn on!

61
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh!

62
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, he's hit a tree.

63
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Come on, hurry!

64
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh!

65
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Is he dead?

66
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
No, he's been knocked out.

67
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He looks dead to me anyway. Where are they? What's happened to the wings?

68
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
In the tree.

69
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Ah, he won't want them anymore, so now I can have them.

70
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Now, let me see.

71
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So, did the test flight go all right?

72
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Will someone tell me what happened?

73
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Well, it was fine until the very end.

74
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm sure that you only need a bit more practice.

75
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Flying isn't the easiest thing to master, you know.

76
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I expect so. Let's hope you don't run out of bandages, though.

77
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Excuse me, snork.

78
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Hmm?

79
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Are you going to use the wings anymore?

80
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I might not. Why?

81
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, well, I'll have them if you don't want them.

82
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I want to fly in the sky, too.

83
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It looks the most exciting thing I've ever seen.

84
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, please let me have them.

85
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, it's not as simple as that moment.

86
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
They need testing before the design is done.

87
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, it's not as simple as that moment.

88
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
They need testing before the design is complete.

89
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But I could do that snork. I know I could do it. Please let me have them.

90
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Well, I suppose I could do with some help.

91
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There's a lot to do, fetching and carrying mostly.

92
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You haven't said if I can have the wings or not yet, snork.

93
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes, you can, but on one condition.

94
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Anything.

95
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Well, now the blueprints are finished and the wings are more or less right.

96
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll need somewhere to build the ship and somewhere to store all the materials so they'll be dry and at hand.

97
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes, you will snork. I can see that.

98
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It doesn't have to be much, just a roof will do or and walls.

99
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So that people can't spy on me and steal my ideas.

100
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I can do the building myself, but I'll need some help and when it's finished, you can have the wings.

101
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Great. I'd love to help you. I'd have done that anyway, but now that I can have the wings, I'll work twice as hard.

102
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You won't regret it, snork. I promise you you won't.

103
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Splendid, woman. That settled them.

104
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Perhaps we can get more help. I'm sure that'll be easy. How about it, snuffkin?

105
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yes, of course.

106
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Will you help us do sniff?

107
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes, but I want something too.

108
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll let you borrow the wings.

109
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No, I'm far too heavy. I only break them.

110
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Don't worry, sniff. I'm sure I'll think of something you can have.

111
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, as long as it's something nice. Oh, I do love helping people.

112
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You're all heart-sniff. We know that for sure.

113
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm sure you'll need some expert help with the shed, snork.

114
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Surely this must be deep enough, Papa?

115
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh, no. Lee Moment's always built for posterity. Besides, I like pouring cement.

116
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Okay, Papa.

117
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I've given your present a lot of fortune, all.

118
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Huh?

119
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And I think I'll give you one of my invaluable books on machinery.

120
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Oh? Don't you want it?

121
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Well, if there was something else, I'm not much of a reader.

122
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What about my invaluable fountain pen?

123
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Invaluable fountain pen?

124
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What about my invaluable...

125
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Do you have anything that's not invaluable, snork?

126
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, what about a gold coin?

127
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Well, that sounds great. A real gold coin?

128
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Oh, boy, yes, that's a deal.

129
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You are digging a very deep hole.

130
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh, why don't you stop and have some sandwiches?

131
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Should we do that, Papa? Go on.

132
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes, I think we can stop now.

133
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Sniff and your brother are in the woods.

134
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yes, I know. I heard them.

135
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Hi, snork maiden.

136
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, no.

137
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Wait a minute. I want to ask you something.

138
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What is it?

139
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Tell me, snork maiden, is it true that your brother gave those wings to a woman?

140
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes, it is. He's helping snork to build the shed his payment.

141
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I thought they'd been broken up. They hit that tree very hard.

142
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Well, my brother's repairing them.

143
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Will you let me pass? I've got to take his lunch to him.

144
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And will he be able to repair them?

145
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He can repair anything.

146
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Mmm.

147
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Gosh, what a lot of wood you've got.

148
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Well, the shed has to be a lot bigger than my flying ship.

149
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Moving and moving Papa are digging holes. They sure are deep.

150
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Everybody's being very kind, very kind indeed.

151
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Mama's cooking and Snuffkin's gone to get nails.

152
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
There are some other things I need him to get as well.

153
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Will you write them down?

154
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Of course I will, snork. Oh, you're such a planner.

155
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Well, I'm afraid all famous inventors have to be.

156
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Whether it was Snork's planning or the fact that everyone in Moomin Valley helped in some way or other,

157
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
the hangar or boat house was finished in record time.

158
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm going to take a look.

159
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm going to take a look.

160
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm going to take a look.

161
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm going to take a look.

162
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm going to take a look.

163
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm going to take a look.

164
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm going to take a look.

165
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm going to take a look.

166
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm going to take a look.

167
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm going to take a look.

168
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm going to take a look.

169
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm going to take a look.

170
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm going to take a look.

171
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm going to take a look.

172
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Here.

173
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Moomin's here.

174
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Come in, Moomin!

175
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Thank you for all your help.

176
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You did so much that these wings are hardly paymented enough.

177
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But if you're happy with them,

178
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh no, it was great fun building the shed.

179
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I changed the design a bit, so it's easier to take off and land,

180
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and turning shouldn't be a problem anymore.

181
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You must remember to give yourself plenty of time though, woman.

182
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Thank you, Snork. I can't wait to try them out.

183
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm so excited. I don't think I'll sleep tonight.

184
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Are you trying them out tomorrow?

185
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
As soon as I can. You will be careful.

186
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You must practice a lot just above the ground to get used to wearing them

187
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
before you try to go too high.

188
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I don't want anything to happen to you.

189
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, practice, I promise.

190
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Where are you going to practice tomorrow?

191
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I haven't decided.

192
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'll find somewhere when I come out tomorrow,

193
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
perhaps on that small hill near the cliff.

194
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But that can't be too dangerous.

195
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'll see you there.

196
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Hey!

197
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Hey!

198
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Hey!

199
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Hi, Moments! Where have you put the wings?

200
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
On the table outside.

201
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You must have gone past them if you came in through the veranda door.

202
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
No, I didn't. They're not there.

203
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What?

204
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh no, you're right. They're gone.

205
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh dear, I thought it was my friend.

206
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What's happened to them?

207
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Somebody stole them.

208
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What's the matter with you, too? Is something wrong?

209
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes, somebody stole and Moments wings.

210
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Well, perhaps they haven't been stolen.

211
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Of course they have, and I bet I know who did it, too.

212
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Come on!

213
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Where are we going? Do you know where they are?

214
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's stinky.

215
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, yeah. Well, it certainly didn't take you long.

216
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Just a minute, stinky. Those are my wings.

217
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
See? I knew it was him.

218
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Stop! You horrible creature!

219
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I certainly will back.

220
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If you give them back, stinky.

221
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'll let you try them out later.

222
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I promise.

223
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
No way, boom, in their mind now.

224
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm going to be a high-flier.

225
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Look out, moving!

226
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Oh, stop!

227
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
There we go!

228
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You're pathetic.

229
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The wings are mine.

230
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'll become a master criminal now.

231
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
All rotten seabing.

232
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You shouldn't have left them outside, Moments.

233
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yeah, but who'd think let each steal them?

234
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Where his friends? Well, almost.

235
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I didn't think even stinky would do something like that.

236
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Well, he did, didn't he?

237
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Now, don't worry, Moments.

238
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We'll find him and get them back. I know it.

239
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Look, Moments. Now he's going towards the sea.

240
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh, no, turn around.

241
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But stinky didn't know how to maneuver the wings.

242
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It was taken further and further out.

243
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Turn around, we'll get turned back.

244
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Until?

245
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh!

246
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You're at least he's having a bath for once.

247
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The wings will be badly damaged.

248
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Never mind. Snark will build another pair.

249
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I sure hope so.

250
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Oh!

251
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the moments.

252
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the moments.

253
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
They're always happy and always at play.

254
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

255
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The movements.

256
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The movements.

257
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the moments.

258
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the moments.

259
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
They're always happy and always at play.

260
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

261
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The movements.

262
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The movements.

263
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The movements.
