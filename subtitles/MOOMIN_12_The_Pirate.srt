1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here they are for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:58,000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Captain Blood and his band of feared pirates had sailed the seas for many years,

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
but never could he remember a storm such as this.

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He began to wonder whether his ship could withstand the battering and buffeting of the angry waves for much longer.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Alas, it is now too late to launch the lifeboat he thought, as he lashed himself to the wheel.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
His voice rose against the wind.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Captain Blood can think of no better death than to journey to the bottom of the sea, losing the last battle against his old adversary.

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But if only I could see the life of the young and beautiful princess who I rescued from the dupe scallion before a ciker,

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I care not about the three chests of doubloons, two chests of jewels and 36 bales of the richest and most colorful silks,

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
but oh must she too perish in this terrible storm.

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is it a good book, Moonman?

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Mmm, it's great.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What a terrible storm, it's not easing at all.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No.

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm so glad I'm not on my own in a night like this.

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I feel safe in Moonman's house.

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, what was that?

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It sounded like a tree breaking.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hey, Moonman.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Mmm, why don't you read your story out loud?

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, okay.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But can I start where I got to?

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As long as you tell us what's happened before, we won't know what it's about, and we might have missed something important.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Just the main points will do, Moonman.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, there's this brave pirate.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's so much fun when someone reads out loud.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Go on, Moonman.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Captain Blood.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And he and his men have captured a rich and royal gallery.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They've taken lots of gold, silver, and jewels and things.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And oh, yes, a princess too.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's exciting, isn't it?

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes, it is.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The storm that rose that night was so violent that at first,

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
it seemed inevitable the ship found before the waves had engulfed it.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Not bad, if I say so myself.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Captain Blood saw that the poor princess had indeed swooned.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
With only the rats for company, how frightened she must have been down in the old.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The noise of the storm was deafening as the ship was thrown above under swirling sea.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The captain's brave heart went out to his young and beautiful captain.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Could I have some tea, Mama?

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Of course, dear. Would you like me to bring it up to you?

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No, thanks. I've finished for the day.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's good. Shall we all have some tea and lemonade?

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes, please. I'm very thirsty.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You read very well. Thank you, Moonman.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Great story, isn't it?

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Could I have some strawberry juice, please, Mama?

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Snork Maiden, when is your brother coming home?

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh, he didn't say exactly.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But in a couple of days, I should think.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It was a good idea to let Snork make him stay while he was away.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Wasn't it, Papa?

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes, it wouldn't be very nice to be all on your own at night in a storm like this.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Not at all.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
She seems to be sinking.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
She won't be able to hold out much longer.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We must get to the crew without delay.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
How could we launch a boat in this weather?

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Any survivors?

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We haven't found anyone yet.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So what about further along the coast?

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Any reports of survivors turning up?

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No, I'm afraid not, Inspector. We haven't heard anything.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Well, tell me if you do.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Ah, Inspector?

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It seems to me it was a pirate ship that sunk.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What did you say?

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, I'm pretty sure I saw the skull and crossbones flying from the mast.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And I think I caught sight of a cannon, but I could have been mistaken.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You must be joking.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I never joke.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can't see anything.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's too far away to make out any sort of skull and crossbones.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Try this.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Ah, you've got a telescope.

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Now why didn't you let me have this before? It might have helped.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh!

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Ah, that's it. She's gone.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I suppose that there aren't many pirate ships around today.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Any that are afloat must be so old that they'd probably break up easily.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's if it was a pirate ship, but it sure looked like one right enough.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Nothing's been washed up on the shore yet.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No, not a thing.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Isn't it strange that I was reading that book about pirates yesterday?

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They probably wouldn't be quite so romantic in real life.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, in the book they were really great. I wish I'd been one.

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
A pirate?

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, what could be more exciting?

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You can't mean that.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, yes, I do. To sail across the seven seas, the holds of your ship's crowned with treasures.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But you'd have to steal the treasure from somebody first, so, Moomin.

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, yes, all right. I suppose so.

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But I wouldn't steal anything from anyone.

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Then you're just a sailor. Not a pirate at all.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Moomin, Mama, do you know where Moomin is?

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He's probably in Snuffkin's tent.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Oh, yes.

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Nork Maiden, I have a letter for you.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Here you are. It's from the snork.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, thank you. Wait a minute, little Mai.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I want to read Snork's letter.

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Take your time.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh, what's the matter?

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's Snork. He's coming home today.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's nice.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But Moomin, Mama, there's no food in the house at all.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now, don't worry about that, Snork Maiden.

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll whistle up some dinner for us, and Snork can tell us all about his trip.

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Boom and Papa like that.

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, thank you, Mama. Snork doesn't like missing his meals.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He must have got the part sooner than he thought.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Ha! That's great news.

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Then he should finish his flying ship soon, hey?

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I guess so.

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He should make it into a pirate flying ship.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I could be his first maid, and no one would be able to catch us.

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Nobody at all!

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Not here.

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Oh, dear. I wonder where they've gone, little Mai.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
There's nobody here.

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Moomin probably wanted to go looking for an adventure.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I bet they went down to the beach to see if anything's been washed out.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
At least the hangar's not been damaged.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's go down to the beach. We may find a treasure chest.

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Huh?

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What is it?

133
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I just thought I heard something.

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Where? From in there.

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Hmm, weird.

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh, I know. The snork must have come back.

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, yes. Snork. Of course.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Hello, Snork.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh, Snork? Are you in here?

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Ah!

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Snork me!

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Put her down.

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, really? It was actually a pirate ship.

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It was indeed Moomin, Papa, and we caught the pirates when they swam ashore.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Do you think you captured all of them, Inspector?

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, of course, we don't know exactly how many there were to begin with.

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hmm, right.

148
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We better barricade ourselves in Moomin's house just to be on the safe side.

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh, dear. And I suppose I ought to stand guard over my greenhouse as well.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Lace me, ma'am. Come here, little panic.

151
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Do let Snork me go. You'll be sorry. You great big hairy folly.

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
No, not in your life, though. It's just my hostage. I need her to make good my escape, ma'am.

153
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Then you only have yourself to blame.

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hey, what?

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Blame? Stay where you are now. I will not be bitten again.

156
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Keep away, little cat.

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Well, don't hurt her then.

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hurt her, you little shark. She's a hostage and I call me one of that.

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
She'll be my safe passenger. These rough waters are perished.

160
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, then you better take me instead.

161
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Because I'm much easier to carry.

162
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You, huh? Nobody would care if I fed you slowly to the shrimps.

163
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh, yes, lots of people. When you overstab win, ma'am.

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
All right, all right. Hold your head with gloomy down. Now, what's your name, girl?

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm Lil Mai.

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Well, I'm Captain Rumpod. Now, go and get whatever authorities you have in this backwater.

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Hurry, my patience is short.

168
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll only go if you promise that you won't hurt Snork Maiden.

169
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Of course, I won't.

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
If I find that you've hurt her in any way at all, my revenge will be terrible.

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
All right, all right, all right.

172
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Captain Rumpod, you are surrounded. Let Snork Maiden go.

173
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Do you hear me, Captain?

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
To a gold button-land lover like you never.

175
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
She's a good-looking wench, fair skinned and nicely rounded.

176
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Pirates prefer blondes. Give me a ship and you can have her back.

177
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What do you say to let my buck-hole?

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You're on your own, Captain.

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We've got all your men locked up tight.

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
All me crew?

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You're the last one. Now, let her go immediately.

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Thank you for saving me crew. I feared they were all lost.

183
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't thank me. They're all in jail.

184
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Someone's saying it's the best place for them, but not me.

185
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Now, let them out. I need them. And a proper ship.

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, with two masks and fifty cannon. And no tricks.

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Else, it'll be worse for the girl.

188
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This is too much.

189
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The school for constables didn't tell us about this.

190
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What should we do, Inspector?

191
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Please get Snork Maiden away from him.

192
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm afraid he'll hurt her and she'll be frightened.

193
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm trying my best, but it's very awkward all this.

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I've not come across anything like it before.

195
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, but it's not her fault that it's ship's anchor, Inspector.

196
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I know, I know. Oh, dear, oh dear.

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Oh, I should have been a gardener.

198
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Hey, are you still there, you ruffian?

199
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Let my men go and get my ship.

200
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Two masks and fifty cannon mine.

201
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Look, Captain Rumpod, I'm afraid that times have changed.

202
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Sailing ships don't have cannon these days.

203
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Shiver me timbers. How do you sink each other then?

204
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't try to fool me. Remember, I've got the girl.

205
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I think Moomin Papa has an old blender bus I'm sure he'll let you have.

206
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't know if it'll work, though. That's all I've got.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm one of you, Peabrain. This is my final word, so listen well.

208
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You have two hours to get the ship ready to sail and all my crew with her mine.

209
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Or else I'll...

210
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Now, don't worry, my pretty one. I won't harm a single hair on your head,

211
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
but I must have something to threaten them with.

212
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Or else I'll feed her to the hungry shot.

213
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Ah!

214
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Oscar, I won't hurt you.

215
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Are you sure?

216
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Either I get my ship, Oak 50 cannon and at least two masters

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
you'll be food for lobsters. It's your choice, my hearty!

218
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I should do it.

219
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He sounds as if he'll do it, too.

220
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Two hours, he says, the real feeder to the sharks. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

221
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What will Snork say, oh, dear, oh, dear?

222
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Ah!

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I have a great idea, sir.

224
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Why don't we climb onto the roof, drill a hole and then drop some on his head?

225
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You know, Constable, I've always thought you were an idiot, now you've proved it.

226
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Excuse me, Inspector.

227
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If we set fire to the henna, then they'll have to come out, won't they?

228
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Shut up! Why am I surrounded by fools?

229
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh, this is no good.

230
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I must calm down, I must calm down.

231
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Captain Rumbot!

232
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Can you hear me, Captain?

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Ah-ha, you found a ship already, have you?

234
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Well, no, there aren't any real sailing ships in Moomin Valley.

235
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The chief Constable has a yacht.

236
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
He doesn't usually let anyone borrow it, but I'm sure in this case he...

237
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I want something big enough to take me to the Spanish main!

238
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I warned you!

239
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Calm down, Captain. Calm down. Now just listen to me.

240
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You haven't done anything wrong here. No pirating or such like.

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So if you forget about the boat, we'll let you all go. Think about it.

242
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Free to go anywhere you like, on foot, of course.

243
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The fresh air, the sun on your face, no worry of shipwrecks, no storms at sea.

244
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What do you think we are?

245
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Huh, we're pirates, not highwaymen.

246
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's not so bad being a highwayman, you know.

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
There'll be lots of rich travelers on the other side of Lonely Mountain, I'm sure.

248
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And lots of adventures with jewels and gold.

249
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Day me with flagens are rubbing a chicken brain, nitwit!

250
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Nitwit?

251
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
No, niggum poop, dumb bill! I'm Captain Rumpot!

252
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You're making me very angry!

253
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
If I had you on my ship, you'd dangle from the yard. I mean, what the play?

254
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The inspector's losing control. We had better call me down.

255
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What the clank would I, and then Mike prison you'd get no butter on their breath,

256
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and maggots on your biscuits?

257
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Please calm down, Inspector.

258
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The pilot's there!

259
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
All right!

260
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Calm down, pick it easy!

261
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Are you sure?

262
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We water!

263
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'd see through it that the bread was milled!

264
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's 30 minutes gone already!

265
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I warned you, gold button.

266
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But now there is only one hour to her painful and horrible death!

267
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Cheer up, snark maiden! Try and hold on!

268
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
We'll get you out!

269
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Water!

270
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Water!

271
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Huh? What did you say?

272
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Water, please. I'm so thirsty!

273
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Water?

274
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Nasty stuff, still.

275
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Hey, land lovers!

276
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Compliments to the galley! The young lady wants a drink!

277
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
All right, captain. I'm coming, smart maiden.

278
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'll take it, Inspector.

279
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's too dangerous. You must leave it to us now, moment.

280
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Just a minute, Inspector.

281
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I think we should let moment go, and I've got an idea that just might work.

282
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Snuff him!

283
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It'll take an awful lot of courage, and you'll have to do it all on your own.

284
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Do you think you can do it, moment?

285
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Of course.

286
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
This place made me raise what's taken him so long, keeping a young lady waiting.

287
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's all right. I really don't mind waiting.

288
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Tell you the truth. I can do it and drink myself.

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's thirsty work, shun an idiot policeman. Don't you worry, little one.

290
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
They'll be here soon.

291
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Get me a drink, too, you hear, and quick about it!

292
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I've brought you something to drink, captain.

293
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
All right, come on, then. And no funny stuff.

294
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Don't worry. I'm on my own.

295
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Have you done a drink for me, too?

296
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes, captain.

297
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
All right, stay there and put down the tray.

298
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The bigger one is for you, captain, and the little one for snark maiden.

299
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Now move away.

300
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And for enough, stay there.

301
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Hmm. Why is it so red?

302
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Well, it's strawberry juice. It's very good.

303
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll be polite. She can drink from this one, and I'll have hers.

304
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But, captain, there's not enough for you in the small one.

305
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Strawberry juice isn't exactly my favorite tip of your know.

306
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
No, the small one will do.

307
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Here you are, young lady.

308
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
No, no snark maiden. Please, don't drink it.

309
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Why not, my young bucko? It's not poison, is it?

310
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Don't be silly. Poisoned? Oh, no, no.

311
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Perhaps a sleeping potion.

312
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Hmm. As I thought, I deemed in mighty strange that two cups were prepared.

313
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You drink it.

314
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh, no, no, no, sir. I'm not thirsty at all.

315
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What's the matter, me lad? You said the drink wasn't poison, didn't you?

316
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So drink.

317
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
No, man.

318
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Ah, you're her swing, are you?

319
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I shall never understand women anyway. One of you will have to drink it, and now.

320
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Not her. I'll do it. I'll do it. Give it to me.

321
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
No, woman, don't. There's something in it. You'll be poisoned.

322
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's all right, snark maiden. It's nothing dangerous. Don't worry about me.

323
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'll drink it.

324
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That's it. Drink up again.

325
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Down the hatch, me lad.

326
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You're lucky and wasn't poisoned.

327
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah.

328
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And no sleeping potion, neither?

329
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Oh, no, nothing at all. Nothing.

330
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh, woman. Oh, no, woman.

331
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You're not my pretty one.

332
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Your wimpy little bow is just taking a nap. You'll be right as rain's soon.

333
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And he thought he could fool me.

334
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Me, Captain Rumpot, the cheek of it.

335
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Well, I'll have the other one.

336
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Not bad.

337
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
No, I'm sorry, young lady. They'll have to bring you another.

338
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Shall we order one without the draft? They'll be surprised when they see me still on my pins.

339
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Why do I not sleep at all?

340
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Let's go and give my surprise.

341
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Help!

342
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Oh, woman!

343
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
A woman!

344
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's all right. I'm okay snark maiden.

345
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
There's nothing in this drink. Would you like some?

346
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
A woman, you mean you?

347
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Well, I was pretending. So I convinced you too, huh?

348
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
A woman!

349
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Captain Rumpot didn't wake up that day, or the next.

350
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And when he did, he had a terrible headache, which served him right.

351
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
The inspector let all the pirates go after a week.

352
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Well, they hadn't done any pirating in Moomin Valley.

353
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And wouldn't be doing any either. Not without a ship.

354
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

356
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

357
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
They're always happy and always at play.

358
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

359
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The movements.

360
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

361
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

362
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
They're always happy and always at play.

363
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

364
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The movements.

365
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The movements.
