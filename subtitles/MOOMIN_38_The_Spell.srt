1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:58,000
there were the movements there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:02:12,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-hhhhhh...

8
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,300
The witch has come to Moomin Valley.

9
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,300
What could she be up to this time?

10
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

11
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

12
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

13
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

14
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

15
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

16
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

17
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

18
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

19
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

20
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

21
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

22
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

23
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

24
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,300
Eldris Cabalasum!

25
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,300
Oh!

26
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,300
Oh, it's snowing again.

27
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,300
I must get a covered brown.

28
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,300
Oh!

29
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,300
The great thaw had come at last.

30
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,300
The Moomin Valley.

31
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,300
I think I can smell spring!

32
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Oh, I've never seen anything like this one before.

33
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,300
Hello there, Mr. Hamilton.

34
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,300
Hello, Sniff.

35
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,300
You're up early this year?

36
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,300
Yes.

37
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,300
I think I've even beat Moomin to it.

38
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,300
Is that so?

39
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,300
Why are the Moomin so late this year?

40
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,300
Moomin, wake up!

41
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,300
Spring is here!

42
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,300
It's time to wake up!

43
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,300
Moomin!

44
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,300
Maybe Snork Maiden's easier to wake up.

45
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,300
Snork Maiden!

46
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,300
And I thought I was difficult to wake up.

47
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,300
I must get closer.

48
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,300
What are you doing, Sniff?

49
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,300
What am I doing?

50
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,300
You can see, can't you?

51
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,300
Of course I can, but why are you climbing up that?

52
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,300
Moomin and Snork Maiden are still asleep.

53
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,300
I have to wake them up.

54
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,300
Why don't you go this way?

55
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,300
It's easier!

56
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,300
What are you doing?

57
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,300
Funny, even Moomin Mama's still asleep.

58
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,300
Wrong room.

59
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,300
Come on!

60
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,300
Wake up, lazy bones!

61
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Moomin, spring has come!

62
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,300
We'll look at that!

63
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,300
Wake up, you sleepyhead!

64
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
Oh, you really are impossible!

65
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Moomin, Moomin, Moomin!

66
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,300
This is odd, even for Moomin!

67
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,300
Open the window, little mind!

68
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
Oh, was I scared?

69
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,300
Oh, I haven't you opened them up!

70
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,300
I've tried, but they won't!

71
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,300
You're kidding!

72
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,300
No one can resist this little mind!

73
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,300
Wake up, Moomin!

74
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,300
I know you're ticklish!

75
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
Hmm?

76
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,300
Hmm?

77
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,300
Hmm?

78
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,300
Hmm?

79
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,300
Hmm?

80
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,300
Hmm?

81
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,300
Hmm?

82
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,300
Hmm?

83
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,300
Hmm?

84
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,300
Hmm?

85
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,300
Hmm?

86
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Moomin!

87
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
Moomin!

88
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,300
I told you so!

89
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,300
Hmm?

90
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,300
Moomin!

91
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,300
Come on!

92
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,300
Eww!

93
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
Eww!

94
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Eww!

95
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,300
Eww!

96
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
Eww!

97
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Eww!

98
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Eww!

99
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,300
Eww!

100
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,300
I give up!

101
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,300
How strange!

102
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
How sad!

103
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,300
What do you mean?

104
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
I think...

105
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,300
You don't think...

106
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,300
You don't think...

107
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,300
It's hard to tell.

108
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,300
I was listening for his heartbeat.

109
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,300
He's still breathing.

110
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,300
And snort baited?

111
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Wake up, you slug of it!

112
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
Snort baited!

113
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
They won't wake up!

114
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,300
This is strange!

115
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,300
Why don't we go and try the other?

116
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,300
Why not?

117
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
I hate it when others are asleep while I'm up.

118
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,300
But then I don't like it much the other way around either.

119
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,300
Do I snap?

120
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,300
Moomin!

121
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Pop up!

122
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,300
Please wake up!

123
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,300
We've tried to wake up Moomin, but he won't!

124
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,300
Wakey!

125
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Moomin!

126
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,300
Mama breakfast time!

127
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,300
Come on, Moomin!

128
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Pop up!

129
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Wake up!

130
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,300
This is no use!

131
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
Goodness!

132
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,300
This seems the Moomins are still hibernating.

133
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
And so is Snort Maiden.

134
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
That's odd.

135
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,300
She always wakes up even before me.

136
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,300
Oh, Moomin, too!

137
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
But this year it seems to be different!

138
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,300
I'll go back home, and I'll come over again in a little while

139
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,300
when the Moomin family will have woken up.

140
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
If they ever do.

141
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Huh?

142
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,300
We've tried everything to wake them up short of buckets of water

143
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,300
and there's no moving them.

144
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,300
We've shouted and shook and pinched and tickled and stopped!

145
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,300
Oh, dear!

146
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,300
It's not just strange, it's ominous!

147
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,300
Oh, my, surely not.

148
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
Hello, everybody!

149
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,300
How is everyone?

150
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,300
What is it?

151
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,300
You all look very scared.

152
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,300
Huh?

153
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,300
Still hibernating?

154
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,300
It's all very strange, Hamilton.

155
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
Moomin!

156
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,300
See?

157
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
Yes, indeed.

158
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,300
How we can really do is wait and see.

159
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,300
I suppose you're right.

160
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Don't worry.

161
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,300
The days are getting longer all the time now.

162
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,300
So the Moomins can't sleep much longer.

163
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
And Snort Maiden?

164
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
Cheat too, of course.

165
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,300
Bet you anything Moomin wakes up when Snuffkin returns.

166
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,300
I think you're right, Sniff.

167
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,300
And then, one day about a week later,

168
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,300
Snuffkin did come back from his yearly trip south.

169
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,300
Snuffkin!

170
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Snuffkin!

171
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Snuffkin!

172
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,300
Snuffkin!

173
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,300
Snuffkin!

174
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
Snuffkin!

175
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,300
Snuffkin!

176
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,300
Snuffkin!

177
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,300
Snuffkin!

178
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,300
Snuffkin!

179
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Snuffkin!

180
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,300
Snuffkin!

181
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,300
Snuffkin!

182
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,300
Snuffkin!

183
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,300
Snuffkin!

184
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,300
Snuffkin!

185
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Snuffkin!

186
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,300
Snuffkin!

187
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,300
Snuffkin!

188
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,300
Snuffkin!

189
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,300
Snuffkin!

190
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Snuffkin!

191
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,300
Snuffkin!

192
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,300
Snuffkin!

193
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
Snuffkin!

194
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,300
Snuffkin!

195
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Snuffkin!

196
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,300
Snuffkin!

197
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
Snuffkin!

198
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,300
Snuffkin!

199
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Snuffkin!

200
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,300
Snuffkin!

201
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Snuffkin!

202
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
Snuffkin!

203
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
Snuffkin!

204
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:53,300
Where's Moomin?

205
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,300
He's in bad.

206
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,300
Moomin's still asleep.

207
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,300
A sleep.

208
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,300
They won't wake up no matter what you do.

209
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,300
What do you think, Snuffkin?

210
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
I think they're very sick.

211
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,300
That's a possibility.

212
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,300
Sleeping sickness, perhaps?

213
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,300
It's very difficult to say.

214
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,300
To me, though, if you want my honest opinion,

215
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,300
I think somebody has cast a very nasty spell on them.

216
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
A spell?

217
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,300
But who would do that?

218
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,300
I think I know.

219
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,300
Huh?

220
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,300
You mean the witch?

221
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Alice is grandmother.

222
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,300
Why?

223
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,300
To tell you the truth, I haven't the biggest idea.

224
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,300
How do we find out?

225
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,300
I'll go to the forest and see her.

226
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,300
And if she did cast a spell, do you think she'd tell you?

227
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,300
I really don't know, but we have to do something.

228
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,300
We can't just leave them sleeping here forever.

229
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
I'll go with you.

230
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,300
I guess I better stay here to take care of things.

231
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Well, if they suddenly wake up, somebody needs to be here.

232
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,300
Snuffkin.

233
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,300
Huh?

234
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,300
That's him.

235
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
At last.

236
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,300
Moomin.

237
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,300
Moomin.

238
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Moomin.

239
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,300
He's dreaming.

240
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,300
Just looking at him makes me feel sleepy.

241
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:23,300
Moomin, I promise to get this horrible spell cast off for you.

242
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,300
Uh-oh.

243
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
Uh-oh.

244
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
Oh, shit.

245
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
Where are you going?

246
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,300
I've done all the chores, even washed out your old push-in jars.

247
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,300
So where are you going?

248
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
It's here, Grandma.

249
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,300
I thought I'd take some time off to celebrate.

250
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
But what about your work?

251
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,300
I'm just going out for the day, Grandma.

252
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
And I know where.

253
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
I only want to see the Moomin's.

254
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
They're still hibernating.

255
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
No, they're not. It isn't winter anymore.

256
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,300
Winter or spring, I happen to know the Moomin's are still asleep.

257
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,300
How could you know what the Moomin's are up to, Grandma?

258
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,300
Hm.

259
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,300
Oh, which is no everything, my dear girl.

260
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,300
Really?

261
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,300
Well, I'll go and see.

262
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
Come here.

263
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,300
I have to admit that I can't help being worried about the Moomin's.

264
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,300
Their windows are open for the spring.

265
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,300
So they can smell the first spring flowers?

266
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,300
Well, I suppose I'd be getting on.

267
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Why didn't you tell them about the witch in the spell?

268
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,300
Well, after all, that was just an idea, I got.

269
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,300
Ideas can be embarrassing if you were wrong,

270
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,300
so don't tell anyone for the time being.

271
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,300
All right.

272
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,300
I'm going.

273
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,300
And I'm leaving, too.

274
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
Okay.

275
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,300
There's Alicia.

276
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,300
Hi, everyone. It's me.

277
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,300
Why do you get a teller?

278
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,300
We better tell of the truth, I guess.

279
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,300
The best thing would be for me to talk to her first.

280
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,300
Yes, I agree.

281
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,300
She's unbelievable. How could she?

282
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,300
I can hardly believe you could be so mean, Grandma.

283
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,300
Calm down, my dear.

284
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,300
Why, I did it all for you, Alicia.

285
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
You did it for me.

286
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,300
If the moments are asleep, why should you go there?

287
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
Do them a world of good, too, along sleep.

288
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,300
How ridiculous, grandmother.

289
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,300
Alicia, you've done quite well in your studies,

290
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:19,300
and if you keep at it, I see no reason why you shouldn't be a fully-fledged witch before 30.

291
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,300
And if I do see the moments, I won't be a witch till I'm 31, is that what you mean?

292
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,300
Now, the moments are very bad, and the ones on you.

293
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,300
They are so disgustingly good, and if you want to be a witch, you mustn't see them.

294
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:41,300
And if I promise never to go near Moomin Valley again, will you lift the spell, Grandma?

295
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,300
Good girl, that's exactly what I wanted here.

296
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,300
You promise me, Dan, Alicia?

297
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,300
I promise, Grandma.

298
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Right, the spell should be lifted.

299
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,300
Snuff guard.

300
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,300
What do you want?

301
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,300
There are two different ways of lifting the spell I cast on the moments.

302
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,300
Uh-huh.

303
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,300
The first one is that I go to Moomin Valley myself and chant the magic words outside their bedroom window.

304
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,300
Oh, Grandma, that's not a good idea.

305
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,300
Oh, oh, you mean people who might be upset about me casting a spell on the moments?

306
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,300
You may be right.

307
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,300
So therefore, Snuff Kid, I have no choice but to ask you to perform the task.

308
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
Oh, but why me?

309
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
You do have your harmonica with you?

310
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,300
Of course.

311
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,300
Let me have it, please.

312
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
Eldris Cabalasome.

313
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
Eldris Cabalasome.

314
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
Eldris Cabalasome.

315
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,300
Eldris Cabalasome.

316
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,300
Eldris Cabalasome.

317
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Eldris Cabalasome.

318
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,300
If you don't stop staring at me, my witchcraft won't be effective.

319
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,300
Alicia, get me the next potion now.

320
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Oh.

321
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,300
Oh.

322
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,300
All right, grandmother.

323
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Eldris Cabalasome.

324
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,300
Eldris Cabalasome.

325
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
Eldris Cabalasome.

326
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Oh, she can't do it if we look at her, huh?

327
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,300
Now, listen, Inspector.

328
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,300
You must do something.

329
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
You are the police, aren't you?

330
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,300
Well, I have to tell you, waking people up is not really part of our job.

331
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,300
But you're our last hope, Inspector.

332
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,300
You must do something.

333
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,300
Perhaps if you could possibly use your whistle to wake them up.

334
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Uh-huh.

335
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
It's very shrill indoors. Good frighten them.

336
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
And fire your revolver.

337
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,300
I'm sure that would do it, Inspector.

338
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,300
I don't carry guns, they're dangerous.

339
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,300
Oh, dear.

340
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
Hey, Snuffkin!

341
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Little Y!

342
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,300
He sounds worried, I bet they're still fast asleep.

343
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,300
Hmm.

344
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,300
Right, Snuffkin?

345
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,300
Get on with it.

346
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
Hmm.

347
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
It's not working, is it?

348
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,300
Give me a chance, Snuff.

349
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Hmm.

350
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
Snuffkin!

351
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,300
Snuffkin!

352
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Snuffkin!

353
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,300
Snuffkin!

354
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
Snuffkin!

355
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,300
Snuffkin!

356
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
Snuffkin!

357
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,300
Snuffkin!

358
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,300
Snuffkin!

359
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
Snuffkin!

360
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,300
Snuffkin!

361
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,300
Snuffkin!

362
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,300
Snuffkin!

363
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
Wake up, spring is here.

364
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Come on.

365
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,300
Hmm.

366
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
Hmm.

367
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,300
Hmm.

368
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,300
Hmm.

369
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,300
Oh, spring is here already.

370
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
Good morning, Papa, dear.

371
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,300
Hmm.

372
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
Good morning.

373
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
I have a feeling we've over slept.

374
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,300
I wonder whether the others are up yet.

375
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,300
Snuffkin?

376
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,300
Oh, shut up, Snuff.

377
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,300
Maybe she forgot how to cast off the spell.

378
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,300
Hi, Snuffkin!

379
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,300
Hi!

380
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,300
Ah!

381
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,300
Morning!

382
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,300
Morning, everybody!

383
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,300
Hi, Snuffkin!

384
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,300
I'm so glad you were right back already, Snuffkin.

385
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Yes.

386
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,300
You woke up early, too.

387
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,300
Did you hear that?

388
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,300
It's you that woke up late, woman.

389
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Ah, who we?

390
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Hmm.

391
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,300
Ah.

392
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,300
Now I say, movement's all ready up and about.

393
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,300
What?

394
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,300
Ah, hi, Snuff!

395
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,300
Oh, it's you, you're awake.

396
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,300
I'm glad I didn't blow my whistle.

397
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,300
But we did have a reason to be worried, Inspector.

398
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,300
He's right.

399
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,300
What about, moment, Mama?

400
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,300
And, moment, Papa?

401
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
Oh, there, everybody.

402
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,300
Is anything the matter?

403
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Nothing at all.

404
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
There are weak.

405
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
Oh, dear, I don't understand.

406
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,300
You don't understand words.

407
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,300
We were very worried because you just wouldn't wake up.

408
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,300
Oh, really?

409
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,300
You do know we always have a night, don't you?

410
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,300
We sleep all winter, and we always wake up in the spring.

411
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,300
Of course, of course, but this year, start your turn.

412
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
Right, well, we did have a bit of a problem.

413
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,300
You see, moment, Papa, we couldn't swim.

414
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Snuffkin.

415
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,300
You're back already.

416
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,300
Yes.

417
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
Why don't you listen to us, moment, Papa?

418
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,300
Very well.

419
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
Why don't you come in and we'll have a nice cup of tea,

420
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,300
and then we can discuss your problem properly.

421
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,300
But it's your problem, I'm afraid, not ours.

422
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
What does he mean?

423
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
We don't have a problem, do we?

424
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,300
Please do come in anyway, everybody.

425
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,300
Please.

426
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
You too.

427
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
All of you, come in.

428
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,300
Come in, everybody.

429
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,300
I'm on the side.

430
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,300
I'm in Georgia.

431
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
Whatever happened was this year.

432
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
Hey, Snuffkin.

433
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,300
Alicia!

434
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Alicia!

435
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,300
Alicia!

436
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,300
Oh, man!

437
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
We've come to see you, Alicia.

438
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,300
That was nice of you.

439
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
Your grandmother isn't home, is she?

440
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,300
No.

441
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
Then we can play hide and seek.

442
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,300
I can't.

443
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
I promise grandma there.

444
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300
Yes, I know. Snuffkin told me.

445
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,300
That was a really great thing to do.

446
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
But you didn't promise not to see us.

447
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,300
You just promised not to go to Mom and Valley, didn't you?

448
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,300
Yeah.

449
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,300
And listen, you never promised not to play with us either, did you?

450
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,300
No.

451
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,300
So, if we came here to see you instead of you to us,

452
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,300
then it's all right, and you don't have to break your promise.

453
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Oh, I suppose so.

454
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Yes, I suppose you're right.

455
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,300
Well, let's play.

456
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
Yay!

457
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:48,300
13, 4, 3, 5, 8!

458
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,300
That afternoon, they all had the most wonderful time playing hide and seek in the woods.

459
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
Ha-ha-ha!

460
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,300
One, two, three,

461
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
your tiniest hour.

462
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:20,300
Five, six, seven,

463
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,300
ha-ha-ha-ha!

464
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:29,300
Mine, ten, eleven.

465
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:39,300
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements,

466
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:47,300
believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

467
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,300
They're always happy and goes at play.

468
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:58,300
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

469
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:08,300
The movements, the movements.
