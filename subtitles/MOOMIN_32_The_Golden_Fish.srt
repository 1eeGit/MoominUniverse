1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:59,000
there was the movements, there was the movements, there was the movements, there was the movements,

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:20,720
When the Hennian first told Mumen about the golden fish, Mumen thought to himself that

7
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
But it must look something like this.

8
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,720
My grandpa told me that his mother had actually seen it.

9
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,720
So you never saw it yourself, Mr. Hemion?

10
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,720
No, I'm a batonist.

11
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,720
It comes to the surface only under very special conditions.

12
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,720
It's very rarely seen.

13
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Conditions?

14
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
Yes.

15
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,720
First of all, it must be right between summer and autumn.

16
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
But that's now.

17
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
Yes.

18
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,720
It has to be in the afternoon sunshine after heavy rain.

19
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,720
Yes, that does narrow it down.

20
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,720
And there must be no wind.

21
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Grandpa said not even a ripple on the water.

22
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Oh dear.

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,720
And there are some other conditions that he really didn't know about anyway to see it.

24
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,720
You must be extremely lucky.

25
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Hmm.

26
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
Just getting to the lake itself isn't too easy.

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
It's way beyond lonely mountains.

28
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,720
Going over lonely mountains and back would take at least two days.

29
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Not really, because I know a shortcut movement.

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
I could take you there and back in one day.

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
Oh, could you do that?

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Yes.

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,720
Have you already been there, Snuffkin?

34
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,720
Just once.

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,720
Oh, will you show me the way?

36
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
You really want to go?

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Yes.

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,720
I must see that golden fish with my own eyes and maybe capture it.

39
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,720
It won't be easy to capture.

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Why not?

41
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,720
From what I've heard, the golden fish is far too clever to get caught.

42
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,720
I know, but it would be so much fun.

43
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
You going alone?

44
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,720
Well, Snorkmaiden said she wanted to come along.

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
She gets these ideas, you know.

46
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
Just Snorkmaiden?

47
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
Uh, maybe a little my.

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,720
What about Sniff?

49
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,720
I think he wants to come along, too.

50
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,720
What about you?

51
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,720
In that case, we'd better go across the mountains.

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
Why is that? Why can't we take the shortcut?

53
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,720
The path is rather steep and dangerous, you know, Moomin.

54
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Especially in the forest of witches.

55
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
Hide the witches?

56
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Not now, maybe.

57
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Oh, so it's safe then.

58
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,720
But it's a very deep forest dark and scary even in daytime.

59
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,720
That's okay, we'll take the shortcut.

60
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
Hmm.

61
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Oh, dear.

62
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Come on.

63
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,720
Good morning, Snuffkin.

64
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
Oh.

65
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
Sorry, Snuffkin, guess I overslept.

66
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Snorkmaiden a little my, aren't here yet.

67
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,720
You're very early.

68
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Hmm, I dreamt I caught the golden fish,

69
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,720
and then, of course, I couldn't go back to sleep.

70
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Well, let's go.

71
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Shouldn't we wait for Snorkmaiden a little my?

72
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?

73
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,720
And anyway, didn't we decide that we wouldn't wait for anybody?

74
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
So it might be better this way.

75
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
What's better this way, Moomin?

76
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Oh, little my.

77
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Why don't you stay here?

78
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
This will be a very tough expedition.

79
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm tougher than you.

80
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Wait for me.

81
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Hey, walk any faster, Snuffkin.

82
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
I'm still so sleepy.

83
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Why did we have to leave so early, Moomin?

84
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
To get there back in a day, Snorkmaiden.

85
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
But we aren't taking the shortcut, are we?

86
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Yes, but it still might get dark before we're back.

87
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
I won't be able to walk back this fast, you know,

88
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,720
because my bucket will be full of water for the golden fish.

89
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Well, don't be disappointed if you don't catch it.

90
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
But that's my whole reason for going.

91
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,720
But you heard what the Himmelin said, Snuff?

92
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,720
We'll be extremely lucky to even catch sight of the golden fish.

93
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,720
I heard him and now's exactly the right time.

94
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Maybe the others made too much noise.

95
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
We'll just have to wait and see.

96
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Don't you worry, I'll catch him all right.

97
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,720
Where are they going sorely in the morning?

98
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
How far is the forest of witches?

99
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
I'd say about two hours.

100
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,720
And can you also tell us how long from one end of the forest to the other, Snuffkin?

101
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
About the same.

102
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
Are there really such things as witches?

103
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
No.

104
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Baby, because I'm not a bit scared of them.

105
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Aren't you?

106
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
Not the least little bit.

107
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
There used to be some, though.

108
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
What witches?

109
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Well, of course, sniff.

110
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,720
What helps do you think that they call it the forest of witches, huh?

111
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,720
And you're absolutely sure that there are no witches now.

112
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
I haven't heard of any coming back.

113
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Mm-hmm.

114
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,720
So you're not absolutely sure that there are no witches?

115
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,720
Where's Moominer still in bed?

116
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,720
He was off before you woke up, Papa.

117
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Mm.

118
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,720
Oh, the golden fish.

119
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,720
Good morning, dear.

120
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,720
I wanted to go with him.

121
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Are you writing your memoirs you're far too busy?

122
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
Mm-hmm.

123
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,720
That's very true with the thought of a fish that no one has seen.

124
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,720
That might have been a whole chapter.

125
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Do you think they'll catch it?

126
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,720
No, I doubt it very much. It's highly unlikely.

127
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
In that case, you should have gone with them.

128
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,720
No, I do know a thing or two about fishing.

129
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Snuffkin does, too, but he's still so young.

130
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Oh, don't worry. I'm sure Snuffkin will manage.

131
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,720
Oh, this is a spooky forest.

132
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Maybe the witch is every time.

133
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Stop it, little lion.

134
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Listen, everybody. Don't stray away from me.

135
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Promise you might get lost.

136
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Oh!

137
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Oh!

138
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Oh!

139
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,720
It's so dark in here.

140
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Sure is, and so thick the sun can't get through.

141
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,720
That's because of those clouds.

142
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,720
I can hear the wind, but we need calm.

143
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Yes, but we also need heavy rain.

144
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,720
You're right. That's what the Hemiellin said.

145
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
It sure looks like rain.

146
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Not only looks like...

147
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Oh, it's raining.

148
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Here.

149
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Thank you.

150
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,720
I gotta say, this rainstorm was very sudden.

151
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Don't worry. It won't last that long.

152
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
How do you know that?

153
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Vagabons do.

154
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
This rain isn't that heavy.

155
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,720
No, it's not bad, but we better hurryer.

156
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,720
We won't get to lake till noon, and that'll be too late.

157
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,720
I don't think we'll get very wet down here, Mum.

158
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
And so why don't we move on?

159
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,720
You're so excited.

160
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,720
What should we do with Snuffkin?

161
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Well, we could move on, couldn't we?

162
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,720
We really aren't getting too wet.

163
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
We better find some shelter quickly.

164
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
But where can we shelter?

165
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
There's nothing in this wood-exec tree.

166
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,720
I'm gonna eat tree then, I guess.

167
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Yeah!

168
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
What is it, Snuffkin?

169
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,720
There's a house over there.

170
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
It's fallen to rock and ruin.

171
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Well, at least it'll keep the rain off.

172
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Hello there, anyone home?

173
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,720
There's nobody here.

174
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,720
No one's lived here for a long time.

175
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,720
I wonder who could have been who lived here all alone.

176
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,720
I know who it was, and so do we all, don't we?

177
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
Surely you don't mean.

178
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
The winches, of course.

179
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Look around for dried spices, magic herbs, broomsticks, and a black cat, an iron pot.

180
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
Appile.

181
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
But no broom.

182
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
No, the witch rode away on it.

183
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
There's someone here.

184
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Who is it?

185
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Let's get out of here.

186
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Came from over there.

187
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
No, that's okay, Snuffkin.

188
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
We gotta get out of this place.

189
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
I can't move, Snuffkin.

190
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Stinky?

191
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Pretty good.

192
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
I bet you were really scared.

193
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
I wasn't a bit scared, Stinky.

194
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,720
It's very rude of snip to faint when he hears my voice.

195
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Where are you off to anyway?

196
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Oh, come on, tell me.

197
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Can't seem to take a joke.

198
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Come on, wait for me.

199
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
That way.

200
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Okay.

201
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Come on.

202
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
This is it, isn't it?

203
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,720
Yes it is.

204
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Where's the golden fish?

205
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
I really don't know.

206
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
I've never seen it either.

207
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,720
With rain, sunshine, and calm, I'm sure the fish will come.

208
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
The golden fish?

209
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
Help me catch it.

210
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
I just gotta have that golden fish.

211
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Oh.

212
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,720
It's deep down in here somewhere.

213
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
I can't see any fish anywhere.

214
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Maybe it was Hemiellin's idea of a very funny joke.

215
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
The Hemiellin doesn't joke.

216
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Let's sit down and wait.

217
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,720
I'm sure the golden fish will appear for us.

218
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
I don't believe it.

219
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,720
Do you mean to say you came all this way here just to see some stupid old fish?

220
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
I came to catch it.

221
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Well, that's even more stupid.

222
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
Hey, stop making those ripples.

223
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,720
So they really got excited and walked all the way, you say?

224
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Oh, to be young again.

225
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Well, I would have gone with them if I hadn't over slept.

226
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,720
I didn't know that you were that young woman, Papa.

227
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Oh, I'm not exactly old, you know.

228
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,720
Pretty interesting to see a fish that hardly anyone's ever seen.

229
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Snip said that he would catch this golden fish if it's the last thing he did.

230
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
Oh, how?

231
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Well, he had a net and a very large bucket to carry at home, then.

232
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
That's a good one.

233
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
What do you mean?

234
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,720
I guess I must have forgotten to tell you all the details.

235
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,720
There's so much you don't know about this fish.

236
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Can't see it from up here.

237
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Oh, the hemulin was certainly right.

238
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Hardly anyone has seen this golden fish and we're not going to see it either.

239
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
Maybe somebody ate him years ago.

240
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Stinky, be quiet, please.

241
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
Did you see it?

242
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
Where did you see it?

243
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Huh?

244
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,720
I saw a fish jump, but I couldn't tell if it was golden.

245
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,720
It was much too far away.

246
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,720
With the sun over there, we'd just see the outlines, Nork Maiden.

247
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Yes, we couldn't really see the color.

248
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Look, everybody, look!

249
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
I can see a raft over there!

250
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Hey, let's take it and go out to the middle of the lake.

251
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,720
But it's much too small for all of us.

252
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Don't worry, Snip. This won't sink.

253
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
I'm staying.

254
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,720
You do what you like, but you'll never catch any fish if you're afraid of water.

255
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Stinky, you can help me. It's gold, you know.

256
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,720
We can sell it for a lot of money and then we'll both be very wealthy.

257
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
I think it was somewhere around here, wasn't it?

258
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
We're less, I suppose, hard to say.

259
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
Well, I can't see anything.

260
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
I can't see!

261
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,720
There's certainly no sign of it now.

262
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Well, we'll just have to sit and wait here.

263
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
We have no choice.

264
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,720
And I'm not going home until I've seen it. I'm happy to wait all day.

265
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,720
You won't find it by looking up at the sky.

266
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,720
You know what? Fish like it in places where there are lots of wings.

267
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Oh, the rafts in the middle of the lake.

268
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,720
And they just want to see the fish, but you wait, I'm going to catch it.

269
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Maybe somebody's already caught it and you can get it in a tin.

270
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
What did you see?

271
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Over there, something shiny jumping!

272
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,720
What did you see? Ditorger, now keep quiet.

273
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
I hate fishing.

274
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Guess we better think about getting back otherwise we'll never get home before nightfall.

275
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,720
I don't want to get lost on a raft in the dark on this lonely lake.

276
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Perhaps we were expecting too much.

277
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Maybe your right's not made in, but I really thought we'd see it.

278
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,720
This is the most disappointing day of my life.

279
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
We can come back.

280
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Yes.

281
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
It's not gonna stop.

282
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
Did you see a moment?

283
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
It's gigantic.

284
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Oh!

285
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,720
We've seen!

286
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Oh, that was right!

287
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
I really saw it!

288
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
I saw it!

289
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,720
I did it, I caught it!

290
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
God, what?

291
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Why the golden fish, of course?

292
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
What?

293
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,720
I've got the golden fish in here if you want to have a look at it.

294
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
See, it's in this bucket.

295
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,720
You don't really believe that is the golden fish.

296
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
It's just another stupid fish.

297
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,720
I can swear that it really was golden when I caught it.

298
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,720
It must have been the sun making it land in the water.

299
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,720
It was you said it was the golden fish.

300
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Why don't you let it go?

301
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,720
You know it's not the right one and he hates it in that bucket.

302
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
There he goes.

303
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
It looks so happy now.

304
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,720
It really was golden when I first saw it.

305
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,720
We believe you, Sniff.

306
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Now let's go home.

307
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Sniff and Stinky never really got over their belief.

308
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,720
It was actually the golden fish they had caught.

309
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,720
But moving in the others were in no doubt about what they had seen.

310
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,720
They and the emulators were great friends.

311
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
They were great friends.

312
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
They were great friends.

313
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
They were great friends.

314
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,720
They were great friends.

315
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
They were great friends.

316
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
They were great friends.

317
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
They were great friends.

318
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720
They were great friends.

319
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
They were great friends.

320
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
They were great friends.

321
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
They were great friends.

322
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
They were great friends.

323
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
They were great friends.

324
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
They were great friends.

325
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
They were great friends.

326
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
They were great friends.

327
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
They were great friends.

328
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,720
They were great friends.

329
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
They were great friends.

330
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
They were great friends.

331
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
They were great friends.

332
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
They were great friends.

333
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,720
They were great friends.

334
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
They were great friends.

335
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
They were great friends.

336
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
They were great friends.

337
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
They were great friends.

338
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,720
They were great friends.
