1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,920
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with

2
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:30,800
me here for you on your TV they are the movements they are the movements so come

3
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,600
with me give me your hand I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,000
like a bird sing that song ever there were the movements there were the

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:59,280
movements there were the movements there was the movements there was the movements

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:44,760
The rain was falling on Moomin Valley as though the heavens had decided to empty

7
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:55,240
themselves. It was the wettest weather that anyone could remember.

8
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:39,160
Mama, can I borrow all this?

9
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:46,760
Of course, dear.

10
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,280
And this one too?

11
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,840
Yes, dear, but what do you need them for?

12
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,760
It's a secret. A secret?

13
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,720
Yeah, sure.

14
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,320
I'll want to see a back moment, but you can keep the jar if you like.

15
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:05,560
Thanks.

16
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:23,320
Oh, dear, oh, there are puddles everywhere.

17
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,760
Oh, dear, Mr. Hemmielen, what a mess.

18
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Hello, Mr. Hemmielen.

19
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,480
Oh, good morning, Moomin.

20
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,880
Oh, it's all misty now.

21
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,480
What are you doing, Moomin?

22
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,800
Observing very closely.

23
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,040
Oh, splendid, my boy. I'm glad you find botany so exciting.

24
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,520
Oh, what exactly is it you're observing?

25
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,720
I'm sure I saw a beautiful crayfish in there.

26
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,240
Crayfish? Excuse me, young man, but that is the wallets.

27
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:13,920
Is he quite the most un-interesting field?

28
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,920
Oh, there it is.

29
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

30
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:08,120
Ahahahaha. I got him, I got him. I got him.

31
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Oh, dragon.

32
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Mm-hmm.

33
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Mm-hmm.

34
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Papa!

35
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
Oh, what have you got?

36
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,120
I don't know.

37
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,120
I don't know.

38
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
I don't know.

39
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
I don't know.

40
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Papa!

41
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Oh, what have you got?

42
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,120
I don't know.

43
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,120
Oh, what have you got there?

44
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,120
Oh, oh, nothing, Papa.

45
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
Everything's so fresh after the rain.

46
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120
Oh, woman.

47
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
Yes, it is.

48
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,120
I've got to show this to Snuffkin before anybody else sees it.

49
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Mm-hmm.

50
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Mm-hmm.

51
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Mm-hmm.

52
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,120
Mm-hmm.

53
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Oh.

54
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Mm-hmm.

55
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Mm-hmm.

56
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,120
Boom, woman.

57
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Boom, woman.

58
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,120
What have you got there, woman?

59
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all, little lie.

60
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Oh, yes, you have, I saw it.

61
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Lie to me.

62
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,120
It's just one of Mama's old jars.

63
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,120
Liar, liar, I know there's something.

64
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
I don't think there's nothing.

65
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,120
Then why are you hiding it?

66
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Oh, why did a little mice see me?

67
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,120
It's not fair.

68
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
Dragon.

69
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
Oh, yeah, I was right.

70
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
It must be a baby dragon.

71
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,120
Probably the very last one on Earth and washed up by the rain.

72
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
A dragon of my own.

73
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Well, that's wonderful.

74
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,120
Oh, I hope I didn't frighten you.

75
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
I know what I'll do.

76
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,120
I'll take the lid off the jar so you can get some fresh hair, little dragon.

77
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
See? That's better, isn't it?

78
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Come on, little fella.

79
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
We'll give you a car to make you feel better.

80
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Oh, that burnt me.

81
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,120
What a fierce little dragon you are.

82
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Don't worry. I'll look after you.

83
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,120
I'll take good care of you.

84
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
And when your bigger and start to like me,

85
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,120
I'll take you swimming in the sea.

86
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Oh, I'm sorry. You must be starring.

87
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,120
I'll get you something from my nighttime emergency food box.

88
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,120
I've got lots of things in there.

89
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Bound to be something you like.

90
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,120
Go on. Take anything you want.

91
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Oh.

92
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,120
Gosh, that's really clever, little dragon.

93
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Move in. Lunch is ready.

94
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,120
Coming!

95
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,120
Now you stay here. Don't worry.

96
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,120
I'll be back in no time at all.

97
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,120
Remember, you're my own little dragon.

98
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,120
Oh.

99
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,120
Where's Sniff? I thought he was here as well.

100
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,120
He's collecting worms for fishing.

101
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
He'll be here soon.

102
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,120
We'll start without him then.

103
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,120
You know, Mama, certain people keep secrets in glass jars.

104
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Secrets?

105
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,120
Oh, yes, a little secret that hisses.

106
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Moment, Mama, I found this near the big puddle.

107
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
Thank you, Sniff.

108
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,120
Moment, I told you I wanted it back.

109
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,120
It's my very best one.

110
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,120
Sorry, Mama. I was so excited.

111
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,120
I must have left it when I found...

112
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
I mean, when I was...

113
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,120
And I'm sure you know who I mean by certain people.

114
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Did you catch anything with the sieve, Moment?

115
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Yes, he did.

116
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,120
Something that's now hidden in his room.

117
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Big mouth.

118
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,120
If it's a secret little my.

119
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,120
Perhaps he doesn't want to tell anyone.

120
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Yeah, probably because his new pet bites.

121
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Well, it hasn't bitten you yet, hasn't it?

122
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Huh. If it did, I'd bite it back.

123
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Is it true? Does your secret really bite people?

124
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Well, it couldn't bite very hard.

125
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,120
If it was small enough to go in a jar, could it, Papa?

126
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,120
I suppose certain people might keep other small things in jars,

127
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,120
beetles and spiders, mosquitoes, scorpions, or poisonous centipedes,

128
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
horrible things that multiply and multiply every week

129
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,120
and grow and grow until the jars are too small.

130
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,120
See? Like that.

131
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,120
And there'll be so many of them, thousands and thousands

132
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,120
and they'll take over moving valley and eat us all.

133
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Oh, well, I haven't got a centipede.

134
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
Hmm. I wonder if centipedes come from out of space.

135
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,120
But this is the Earth's deer.

136
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,120
The rain could have brought them down from space, Mama, couldn't it?

137
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Well, you could be right.

138
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
It was raining very hard yesterday.

139
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
And it wasn't like ordinary rain.

140
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,120
I saw a puddle as big as a lake.

141
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,120
What's the matter, Moomin?

142
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
It isn't a centipede.

143
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Huh. We're on the right track, though.

144
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Well, I'm glad it's not a poisonous centipede.

145
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,120
I shouldn't have liked that.

146
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Oh, you're asleep. Moomin's little dragon.

147
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Is it okay if I go see Snuffkin, Mama?

148
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Have you finished already?

149
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Yes, I have.

150
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Tell them they mustn't go into my room.

151
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Or they'll have to take the consequence, sis.

152
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,120
All right, Moomin. I'll make sure no one goes in there.

153
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
I promise.

154
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Oh, but he's going to tell Snuffkin the secret.

155
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,120
I should think he is.

156
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Best friends always come first, little Mai.

157
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Hey, Snuffkin!

158
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,120
Hey, Snuffkin!

159
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,120
Hi.

160
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Fishing again?

161
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,120
Yep. The cards told me that if I caught five minutes, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south.

162
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,120
South?

163
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,120
You're joking.

164
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,120
Not at all. I believe in the cards.

165
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,120
But Snuffkin, winter's not here yet.

166
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,120
I know that. But the cards tell you things for a reason, Moomin.

167
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Do they really?

168
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,120
But it would be awfully few anyway, Snuffkin.

169
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,120
It's just awful. I mean, I'd be very lonely.

170
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,120
And anyway, who would I talk to, or tell my secrets to?

171
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Oh, Snuffkin, quickly. You must come up to Moomin House.

172
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
Now?

173
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Yeah.

174
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Well, I suppose I could fish later.

175
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
No, no. There's no point.

176
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
But I have to catch five minutes.

177
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
Oh.

178
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,120
The fish won't bite after all is rain. You'd catch nothing.

179
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,120
It'll be better to wait until it stops flowing so fast.

180
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Well, perhaps you're right.

181
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,120
So what's this big secret all about?

182
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Hey, Moomin.

183
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,120
Have you ever seen a dragon Snuffkin?

184
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
No, of course not.

185
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
They all disappeared off the face of the earth many hundreds of years ago.

186
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,120
But perhaps they didn't all disappear.

187
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
What if there was one alive somewhere?

188
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
That's impossible.

189
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,120
It could be so small that it would go in a glass jar Snuffkin.

190
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Are you sure you're not daydreaming Moomin?

191
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,120
But still, anything is possible, I suppose.

192
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
But you know me.

193
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,120
I have to see it right in front of me before I believe it.

194
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Oh, where is it?

195
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,120
Mama promised me that she wouldn't let anyone in.

196
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
It's not here either.

197
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Well, you were right, Moomin.

198
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
What?

199
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,120
Ah, there he is.

200
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
I think you've found a real dragon.

201
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
How do you get up there?

202
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,120
He mustn't fall. He might lose his tail.

203
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
Don't move, little dragon.

204
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,120
And Snuffkin, keep quiet.

205
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
He might get frightened and do something silly.

206
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Don't worry. I'll soon have you down.

207
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,120
This will do. I'll lay it on the floor here.

208
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,120
Jump, little dragon. Don't be afraid.

209
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Come on. Hold on to this.

210
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
It will bring you down slowly.

211
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Don't panic.

212
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,120
I don't think it's a very good idea, Moomin.

213
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,120
You'll only scare him away.

214
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,120
Why don't you just leave him alone?

215
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,120
He'll come down when he's ready.

216
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
Dragons aren't helpless, you know, even little baby ones.

217
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,120
But he's so small.

218
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Come to Moomin.

219
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Come on. Don't you understand?

220
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,120
Hold onto that and I'll listen to that.

221
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
Ah!

222
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
Ah!

223
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Ah!

224
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Ah!

225
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
Look at him.

226
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,120
My dragon can fly. He's flying. He's flying.

227
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Come down, little dragon.

228
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,120
You might question or something. Come down.

229
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

230
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Be careful, Snuffkin. He might bite.

231
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,120
I don't think so. He's a very unusual pet.

232
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,120
I think he'll like you more than me.

233
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Ah!

234
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,120
What a charming little creature movements.

235
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
I think he'll like you more than me.

236
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,120
I think he'll like you more than me.

237
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,120
I think he'll like you more than me.

238
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,120
What a charming little creature, Moomin.

239
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
He's lovely. What's his name?

240
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
He's called Little Dragon.

241
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
Huh. I don't think he's lovely at all.

242
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Small but savage, if you ask my opinion.

243
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
That sounds just like you, little mind.

244
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,120
You think so?

245
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Ow!

246
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,120
No, oh, oh, oh.

247
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
Whoa!

248
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,120
Ow!

249
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
Now look here.

250
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,120
Ah!

251
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,120
He seems to have a thing about ears, doesn't he?

252
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
Steps Snuffkins, why doesn't he bite him?

253
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Go on, Dragon.

254
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Go on, Vitamy's really tasty, go on!

255
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Good news, I think he's trying to heat up Snuffkins coffee.

256
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
He must really like him.

257
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,120
Clever little thing.

258
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
Well, I hope he's careful with that hot breath.

259
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,120
We don't want to start a fire.

260
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
All right, that's enough.

261
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
He might be useful.

262
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,120
When he's bigger, we can put him in the cellar

263
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,120
and he'll be able to heat the whole house just like a furnace.

264
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
No, we will not.

265
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Huh?

266
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
Go away! You passed!

267
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
Ow!

268
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
And you!

269
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,120
He only thought you were trying to get his flood.

270
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
I'll get him if he bites me again.

271
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,120
Just you watch me do it.

272
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,120
Come on, little dragon.

273
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,120
I'm sure that'll keep him quiet.

274
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
I'd better go.

275
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Thanks for the coffee, Mumma.

276
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Oh no, it'll suffocate him.

277
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,120
He only seems to like Snuffkin.

278
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,120
Well, we all like Snuffkin.

279
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,120
Stupid old dragon.

280
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,120
No, he isn't.

281
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Mum and dear, why don't you take him to your room?

282
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
He'll be happier there.

283
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
This will be best for him.

284
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,120
Oh, I wonder if he'll come back to visit us.

285
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
Why did you do that?

286
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,120
He was cute and we could have always worn earmuffs.

287
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
You can visit him in Snuffkin's tent.

288
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,120
I expect little dragons already sitting on his shoulder.

289
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,120
It doesn't matter anyway.

290
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Snuffkin's going south soup.

291
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,120
They'll be able to go together.

292
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Oh, my dear, Mumma.

293
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Never mind.

294
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
Well, you're a bit of a problem.

295
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
I don't want you here, little dragon.

296
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Go on, go away. Go to Mumma.

297
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Don't do that.

298
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
Oh, come on, please go to Mumma.

299
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,120
Look, you're very nice and it'll be fun to have you along.

300
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
But there's Mumma.

301
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,120
And he'd know you were here and you'd be upset.

302
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,120
Oh, there's another one.

303
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,120
That's the fifth.

304
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Oh, dear.

305
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,120
Hmm?

306
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Any luck?

307
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
Not bad.

308
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
Are you going far?

309
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Oh, I'm fair away.

310
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
Would you like some fresh fish?

311
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
I'm sure you'll get hungry.

312
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Yeah, what do you want in return?

313
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
A small favor.

314
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
Take this as far as you can.

315
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,120
Open the lid and just leave it.

316
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,120
What? Just leave it?

317
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,120
Yes, in a nice quiet place.

318
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,120
With lots and lots of flies.

319
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Flies? What's in there?

320
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
A dragon.

321
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
A dragon, does it bite?

322
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Well, it might.

323
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,120
This is a big favor.

324
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,120
I don't even like minnows.

325
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Oh, they're not too bad if you roast them.

326
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Keep the lid on.

327
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,120
But make sure you open it up later so it can catch the flies.

328
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,120
All right, as long as it doesn't try to bite me.

329
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,120
Don't worry, it won't.

330
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,120
Hello.

331
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
Hi.

332
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,120
Oh, well, where is he?

333
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Who is that?

334
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
My dragon.

335
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
He must have come here, Snuffkin.

336
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,120
Oh, really?

337
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,120
I thought he was home with you, sleeping in your room.

338
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,120
No, I let him out.

339
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Ah, well, dragons are very fickle.

340
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,120
All they really care about is big fat flies.

341
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
It's best to forget about a moment.

342
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,120
Did you catch your five minnows?

343
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,120
No, you were right.

344
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
The water is too fast.

345
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Oh, really?

346
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
So I won't go soft until winter comes.

347
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
You'll stay here then?

348
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Well, I'm sure it wouldn't do to go against the cards.

349
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
Now what a moment, my friend.

350
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
Oh, that's great.

351
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
You're staying, Snuffkin.

352
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
That's fantastic.

353
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,120
That's really, really good.

354
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,120
Ah, perhaps I shouldn't have painted the float bright red.

355
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,120
It might have scared those little minnows right away.

356
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Okay, let's go.

357
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
Yeah.

358
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,120
That dragon was sort of stupid.

359
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
Baby dragons are.

360
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,120
They make the world's worst pets.

361
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
They never want to settle in one place.

362
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Yeah, you're right.

363
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,120
It was very funny, though, when it bit little mice here.

364
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,120
I think it gave her a taste of her own medicine.

365
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,120
The woman was very happy that Snuffkin was staying in Moomin Valley

366
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,120
and not going south until winter.

367
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:06,120
And as for the dragon, well, who wants to be loved by a silly old dragon?

368
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:13,120
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

369
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

370
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,120
They're always happy and always at play.

371
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,120
The movements are having fun day after day.

372
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,120
The movements.

373
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,120
The movements.

374
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:42,120
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

375
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:49,120
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

376
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,120
They're always happy and always at play.

377
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,120
The movements are having fun day after day.

378
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,120
The movements.

379
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,120
The movements.

380
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:11,120
The movements.
