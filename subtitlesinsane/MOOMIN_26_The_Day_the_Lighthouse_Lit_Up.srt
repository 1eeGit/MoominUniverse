1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're here for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm going to say that I'm not going to say that. I'm going to say that I'm not going to say that. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:01:35,400
sing that song ever, there were the movements, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la The

11
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,040
movements came to this island to visit a real lighthouse.

12
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,120
But when they got there, they found it was completely deserted.

13
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,599
No light and no lighthouse keeper.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,799
Oom and Papa is going to try and mend the lamp,

15
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,599
and the others are all helping to clean up.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,799
This is it, then.

17
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,400
Do you think it's broken, Papa?

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,599
Well, I'm not sure.

19
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,000
I've not had a great deal of experience with this sort of thing.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Look over there, Moomin. It's the boy and the fisherman from the boat.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
They're a bit strange, aren't they?

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
They must live somewhere here on the island.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Hmm, let's see. What's this? By the door, when you haven't quite finished yet. Well, at least we can see the floor now.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I think the keeper must be lying dead under the dust.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Nobody's cleaned here for a long time.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's for sure.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That probably means the lighthouse lamp hasn't been working for ages either.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I wonder if Papa will be able to fix it.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I wonder if they're going to manage to get the light working all right.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hm? I wonder if they're gonna manage to get the light working all right.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Well, the lighthouse without a lamp is pretty sad, isn't it?

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Come on, light, will you?

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Right, I'll give you one last chance.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Then I'm getting the big spanner. Now you don't know me, but I don't give in easily, especially to machines.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Have you thought brass brain what will happen tonight if there's a storm and there's a ship out there looking for land or trying to keep off the rocks and there's no light to guide them? You'll be sorry Dan, but it'll be too late.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And all I can say is that if the light hasn't been working for some time that I'm afraid that there could have been many shipwrecks.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,120
Oh, that's awful.

38
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,520
Well, it would be dangerous to come too close to the island

39
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,879
without a light to help you.

40
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,639
I wouldn't be surprised if that ghost ship went one of them.

41
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,520
It all seems very strange, and I wonder what made the lighthouse

42
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,599
keep her leaving such a hurry.

43
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,800
Unspeakable horror.

44
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Please be quiet, little my.

45
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,639
It's obvious.

46
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,500
Close thrown about dishes left unwashed.

47
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,400
Big soft puzzles have finished.

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,280
It's an unsolved mystery of the sea,

49
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
just like the Marie Celeste.

50
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,360
And if you don't understand that,

51
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,439
then you're being even stupider.

52
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,439
Then usual.

53
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,720
Oh dear poor man, I wonder what he was like.

54
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,920
He must have been very lonely here on his own.

55
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,560
He scribbled messages over the walls like no side of a ship.

56
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,639
It's Christmas, another month gone.

57
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,800
I must clean the lamp, and I need to talk to someone.

58
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,920
Oh, well, if he didn't see many ships,

59
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,560
at least they could have been many ship or X either.

60
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, I hope not, Papa. That would be one good thing anyway.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,800
Perhaps the sea came and took him on a dark and stormy night,

62
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,600
and he was swept out and no one saw him go.

63
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,800
That's rubbish, little my, on dark and stormy nights.

64
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Lighthouse keepers, it's safe by a fire drinking hot tea, laced with rum.

65
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,600
He might have run out of rum and gone to get more.

66
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,100
Well, I don't think anything terrible happened to him.

67
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,800
He just got more and more lonely and fed up and then went off and got a girlfriend.

68
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,199
Be careful, Snuffkin.

69
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,699
It's very rough and not even, and you don't want to fall into the sea.

70
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,000
I certainly don't.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,800
Now, watch your step. The rocks are very slippery.

72
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
But, um...

73
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,300
Are you all right?

74
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes, Lang. I didn't think they'd be a slivery as all that.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What?

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What's the matter?

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Look over there!

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There's something moving, but I can't see what it is.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's probably a boat.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, no, that's what I call a real ship.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's not a real one.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What do you mean?

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's the ghost ship, the one we saw last night.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,199
You're right. Why isn't it come back, Snuffkin? What does it want?

85
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,600
I don't know. Perhaps it followed us to the island and for some reason wants to make contact.

86
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's go home, Snuff Ken. I don't like this.

87
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
No! No! No! What's up? Oh no! Oh No Oh

88
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,639
No, I'm having a great dream and you can be with me. Hey, oh, it was horrible

89
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,519
Someone stepped on my face. Well none of us sleep. What can since we were all asleep? What are you just saying?

90
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,519
Very odd

91
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,500
No, somebody's on my stomach now.

92
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Don't be stupid.

93
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,000
I have a look, Snuffkin.

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,500
There must be something there.

95
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Please, Snuffkin, please.

96
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
I can't see any.

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What's that?

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What is it?

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't know yet, movement.

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,160
I think I can see a pair of feet.

101
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,879
A pair of feet.

102
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,480
No legs, just feet.

103
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
But that means...

104
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
A ghost.

105
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Oh, help!

106
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Get it off me!

107
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Go away, go away!

108
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Let me at them!

109
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Where are they?

110
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,040
I'll teach them to spoil my dream!

111
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
They're on my face now!

112
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Go away, will you?

113
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,560
Show me a footnoss, damn pony!

114
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,000
Stop it, move!

115
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No, I hate it!

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You go fishing again today? No, I'm not. Oh, do you need me or is it alright if I go and see those people in the lighthouse?

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh, I don't want you one.

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay, goodbye then.

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You mean this room is really hot?

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It certainly is.

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But we only saw a pair of feet.

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Hmm. I'll sleep here tonight. You mean this room is really haunted? It certainly is.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But we only saw a pair of feet.

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Hmm. I'll sleep here tonight. Don't worry. I'll protect you.

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you going to scare it away, Papa?

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Hmm.

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I can't find any good shells.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're me.

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What about this one?

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh yes, that's lovely.

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Uh-huh?

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Go on, take it. I don't collect them.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Who are you?

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, I'm a ghost, sort of.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Are you the rat who walked over us last night?

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You were lucky I didn't grab you.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,500
Sorry, it wasn't just me.

138
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
That why are a few of us?

139
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,000
Now walk over each other.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Can I give you a present?

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You can't get around me that easily.

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You better show yourselves or you'll be sorry.

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's just me.

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The others have all left me and gone off with the ship.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Ha!

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So why didn't you go with them?

147
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, I wanted to, but uh, well...

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,500
Come on, out with it!

149
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,000
Well...

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,500
Never got me!

151
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,500
And let me all of my own, and I was frightened!

152
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Well, I can see why they wouldn't want a drippy thing like you around.

153
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,000
You call yourself a ghost!

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No, I'm sorry!

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I just can't work out what's wrong with it.

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let's try to see what are here. Quick, open all for ages, Moomin, Mama.

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Would you like some more?

158
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, he has, please. Can I have the recipe? I could make some for the fisherman. I know he'd love it.

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll write it out for you. What's his name?

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't know. He doesn't say. I've come from the north. I left about three years ago.

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,159
I've come from the north. I've he'd love it. I'll write it out for you, what's his name?

162
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't know, he doesn't say.

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,759
I've come from the north, I left about three months ago,

164
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,840
although it seems a lot longer, and I'd been rowing south

165
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,039
in my small boat, trying to reach Moomin Valley.

166
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,960
Oh, really? We live there.

167
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,519
Do you? You're lucky, it must be very nice.

168
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,000
I've never been there, but I've heard that it's beautiful.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Anyway, there was a violent storm in my little boat cap-sized. He rescued me, and I've stayed with him in his cabin ever since.

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And he doesn't talk about himself at all. That's very strange.

171
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
No, but I think he does have a big secret.

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
How do you know, Taft?

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,200
Well, sometimes he just stares and stares at the lighthouse in any sort of size.

174
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,759
I wonder why.

175
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,399
I did ask him once, but he glared at me in such a nasty way.

176
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,759
I haven't dared say a word about it since.

177
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,000
You don't want to stay with him then?

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,120
Oh, yes. Well, most of the time he's really nice to me and since I've been here,

179
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,799
I've sort of taken care of him because you see he doesn't really look after himself.

180
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,840
Oh! Could I have a cup of tea, please, Mama? Yes, dear. I've sort of taken care of him because you see he doesn't really look after himself

181
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,279
I have a cup of tea please mama

182
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,879
Yes dear. How is the light coming along? Oh, not very well. There's still a few more things I could try though Hello, you were on that boat fishing, weren't you?

183
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,679
Yes, I was my name is Taft moment papa. Oh please to meet you

184
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,000
Is your friend here as well? I wanted to ask him something.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There's something quite important.

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ask him what?

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, about this lighthouse for one thing.

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Well, he won't talk about that.

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He just refuses to.

190
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh dear, does he?

191
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The thing is, I'm trying to light this beacon

192
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
but having no success.

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I wondered whether he might know if there's an easy way of doing it.

194
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You never know. I've missed something.

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,440
It's very quiet.

196
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,960
He might be out fishing, you know.

197
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,200
Come on, let's go.

198
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,440
Where are you going, Moomin?

199
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,679
I want to ask that man some questions.

200
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,600
He doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who does a lot of talking.

201
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,240
Do you think he might know something about the lighthouse keeper?

202
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:30,000
That's what I want to find out.

203
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Hello, my name is Moomin and this is my friend Snuffkin.

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What's your business here?

205
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I wonder, do you live here?

206
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I suppose you must have met the lighthouse keeper, have you? I don't want people to have other bouts.

207
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We were just curious about why you left the lighthouse. Do you know why?

208
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
No, you kept themself to and myself.

209
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Ah, so you do know it. When did he leave? Where did he go? You must know.

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Oh, please. Had the light stopped working before he left?

211
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,240
Why did he leave the door open? Were there any shipwrecks?

212
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
Awww!

213
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,440
Wait a minute!

214
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,360
Just one more question please!

215
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,480
Oh don't go!

216
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,679
There's something very important I need to know.

217
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,799
You're the only other person on the island apart from the go ship.

218
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,200
Oh no, please come back.

219
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,320
Look, my father is trying to get the lamp working again,

220
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,759
but not getting anywhere.

221
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,559
So if you know where the keeper is,

222
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,159
or better still, how to light it,

223
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,519
will you please help?

224
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,679
It's not only for us, but for all those ships

225
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,919
that might be in danger without it.

226
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,759
Oh.

227
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,000
Moomin.

228
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,600
I don't think that man knows much about anything.

229
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,480
Well, at least he's heard you and knows what you want.

230
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,000
Let's go, Moomin.

231
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Look, over there what's Moomin Papa doing?

232
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Snort made an a little Maya helping him.

233
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Hiya!

234
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Come on!

235
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah.

236
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's about time where are you two being?

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What are you building now?

238
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We're making a raft! Why?

239
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Because we wanted to stoop at why else would we build it? Do you like it?

240
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
But why do you want a raft?

241
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,399
Not really a raft, is it Papa?

242
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,399
Let me present our very own hand-built ghost ship.

243
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,799
A ghost ship?

244
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,200
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

245
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,799
He must be here somewhere.

246
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,799
Well, if he's the one that walked on me last night, I want a word with him.

247
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:46,000
Yes, sorry. I'm afraid that was me and my friends.

248
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Oh, where are you?

249
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Show us a bit of leg at least. I like to see you. I'm talking to you.

250
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yes, all right.

251
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh, well, at least he looks like a ghost.

252
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Thank you.

253
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Ghosts look pretty silly when the sun's shining if you ask me.

254
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, it was your idea.

255
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
I always thought ghosts were frightening.

256
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,759
Yes, we forgot our chains last night.

257
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,960
It's very hard to be ghostly without them.

258
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,679
We did our best to scare you, though.

259
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,440
The ghost came to this island because a light

260
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,279
else was a bit like an ancient castle.

261
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,279
We feel more at home in castle.

262
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,519
And now when they found us here, they

263
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,679
changed their minds and gave up.

264
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,840
That's funny, isn't it?

265
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,360
Ah!

266
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,279
Oh, what's the matter?

267
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,000
You look a bit fed up.

268
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's because he's been left behind by the other ghosts.

269
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
They've gone off in the ghost ship.

270
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Wow, they didn't tell me they were going straight away.

271
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And I'd gone to the lighthouse keepers cabin.

272
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The lighthouse keeper?

273
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Why did you go there?

274
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Well, I wanted to tell him that some strange people...

275
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,080
I'm sorry, I mean, strangers, had moved into the lighthouse,

276
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,679
and that he'd be better off with us

277
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,639
because ghost don't damage things.

278
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,399
I didn't know you then, of course,

279
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,720
but some people are very kind.

280
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,440
Where is his cabin? Is it easy to find?

281
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,639
At the southern end of the island.

282
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,840
But it was a waste of time

283
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,360
because he wouldn't talk to me.

284
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,679
I shouldn't have bothered,

285
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,240
and then I would have caught the boat.

286
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,000
Anyway, he's not going back to his job. So that's that

287
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Bye-bye. Thanks again for the raft

288
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Take care! I hope you catch up with your friends real soon

289
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Thank you. You're okay for mortals. I promise next time we meet up Ereli's scourge. Chains and all

290
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,840
Lots of chains and we promise to be terrified! You can come and scare me anytime you want!

291
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,039
Bye!

292
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,440
Relating a try!

293
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,039
Bye, promos, I will!

294
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,679
Bye!

295
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,840
He said anything that could float would do,

296
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,080
but that raft seemed a bit flimsy to me.

297
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,480
I wouldn't like to chance it.

298
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,679
It can be rough out there.

299
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,279
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

300
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,799
Ghost can't drown, can they?

301
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,919
They're dead already.

302
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,240
Mama, what is it, Moomin dear?

303
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,559
Papa's gone fishing again. Well, he enjoys it.

304
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,000
Well that's all he seems to do these days. He's not working on the lamp at all. Well, perhaps living in a new place

305
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
makes him want to do a new thing

306
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
and he does catch one now and again.

307
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Huh?

308
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What are you making, little boy?

309
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
An elevator.

310
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
An elevator?

311
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes, and when that's finished, I'm going to build a house.

312
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh, my goodness. A house of my very own. A elevator? Yes, and when that's finished, I'm gonna build a house!

313
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh my goodness.

314
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
A house of my very own!

315
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh...

316
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Mumen Papa doesn't seem his usual happy self,

317
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,339
even though he enjoys his fishing.

318
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:52,079
He's upset that he couldn't make the lamp work and isn't used to failure, but nothing he tries makes any difference.

319
00:17:52,079 --> 00:18:27,000
What a pity it would be to leave the island without seeing the beautiful beams shining over the water. Yeah, hey, coming up a lot, everyone. I finished my house.

320
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Hey, mom and dad, but come here. The fisherman's coming.

321
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Wow, the fisherman.

322
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes, and the boy is with them.

323
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:48,400
The loft's outside.

324
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
You don't want to do it, do you? No, but I gotta do it.

325
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,599
Right!

326
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Here you are. So, uh, what can we do for you?

327
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh!

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you.

329
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Mmm?

330
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,759
Tough just told us it's your birthday today, so all the best wishes from us.

331
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:33,759
My birthday?

332
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,559
Is it really?

333
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:38,759
Excuse me for asking, but how old are you?

334
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,319
I just don't remember.

335
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,319
It doesn't matter.

336
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm sorry we don't have any presents.

337
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,319
I haven't had coffee for many, many years.

338
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,160
Bring the barrel, woman mama.

339
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Yes dear.

340
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,880
Now let me see.

341
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,599
I found this sauerster.

342
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,279
I wonder if it suits me.

343
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,279
What do you think?

344
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:08,000
Well, I suppose this must belong to the lighthouse keeper.

345
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Why don't you try it on? You look good in a cell-ware store. There it suits you.

346
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We'd love to know why you left the island and why you didn't come back in.

347
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,920
And also why you didn't like the land.

348
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,440
We really would like to know if you feel you could tell us.

349
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,319
I was so lonely for years and years.

350
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,839
Then I just went away.

351
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,279
I'm afraid that's all.

352
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,440
But you did come back.

353
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,000
Surely that must mean something.

354
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I knew I'd lived here for too long. Much too long.

355
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You see, I didn't really fit in anywhere else.

356
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,839
This is the lighthouse keeper's uniform, isn't it? Why don't you put it on again?

357
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,839
And look, it's nice here.

358
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,839
I'd like to stay with you, mind that.

359
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,440
I'll stay if you let me.

360
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,039
Oh, I'd love that.

361
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:26,000
It'd be fun to see you looking like a lighthouse keeper. Oh, hooray! Oh, hooray! Oh, hooray!

362
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Three days later, the movements left the island.

363
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
They decided to leave at night with the safe blow of the lighthouse beams guiding their path, out and away to Mars.

364
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The Three days later, the Moomans left the island. They decided to leave at night with the safe blow of the lighthouse beans guiding their path out and away to Mooman Valley.

365
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Mooman Papa had quite forgotten about his epic novel love the living, the movements.

366
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

367
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,240
They're always happy and always at play The movements are having fun day after day

368
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,640
The movements

369
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,640
The movements

370
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,319
They love the laughter and they love the living

371
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,720
The movements

372
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,799
They're leaving and sharing and caring

373
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,000
And giving the movements.

374
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
They're always happy and goes at play.

375
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

376
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The movements. The moment, the moment
