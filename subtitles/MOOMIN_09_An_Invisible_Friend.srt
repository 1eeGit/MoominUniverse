1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:58,000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:02:16,000
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

8
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,600
Tiki's arrival was very welcome.

9
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,340
Good evening, Mom.

10
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,280
Tiki, come in.

11
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,680
Mama, Tiki's here.

12
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,280
Come on in, Minnie, a neat Moman.

13
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,600
Uh-oh.

14
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,280
Is there someone with you?

15
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,400
Yes, I brought my friend, Minnie.

16
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,160
Minnie, don't be shy.

17
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,280
Well, there's no one there.

18
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,360
Yes, there is.

19
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,200
You just can't see her.

20
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,640
Really?

21
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,280
Yes, I'm afraid she's very, very shy.

22
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,480
I'll leave the door open for you, Minnie.

23
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,320
Come in when you're ready.

24
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,640
She'll get soaked if she stays out there.

25
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,680
Maybe that doesn't matter very much if you're invisible.

26
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,520
Oh.

27
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,320
Tiki, how nice.

28
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,120
What is everyone looking at?

29
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:23,920
About Minnie, you know sometimes when people are very frightened, they can become invisible

30
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,160
to the people around them.

31
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,720
Poor Minnie, she's looked after by an aunt who doesn't like her and is really horrible

32
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,840
to her and who only does it because she thinks it's her duty.

33
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,560
It wouldn't be so bad if she just got mad and yelled at her.

34
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,040
But she's cold and sarcastic, which is much worse.

35
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,640
She doesn't care if Minnie is unhappy and gives her horrible jobs.

36
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,680
What's sarcastic?

37
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,760
Uh, let's see.

38
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,000
Suppose you tripped and fell over.

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,880
What would Moman Mama say?

40
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,760
Well, she does mean if I'd hurt myself.

41
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,640
Yes, well, you're lucky that Moman Mama is so nice, but a lot of people would be mad

42
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
at you.

43
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,720
This nasty old lady would say, that may be your idea of dancing, but try not to do it

44
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,040
when people are eaten, please.

45
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,000
Gosh, that's horrible.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,160
Anyway, she just went on being more and more horrible to her so that in the end, Minnie

47
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,680
was so upset she became invisible.

48
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,640
On her answer, she couldn't be bothered to look after little girl she couldn't see.

49
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,480
Poor Minnie.

50
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,480
So she asked me to do it.

51
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,960
Minnie's still outside.

52
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,160
Too nervous to come in.

53
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,360
But what did you do to this old aunt?

54
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,040
I hope you told her she heard Minnie's feelings.

55
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,120
She wouldn't have done any good, not with someone like her.

56
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,920
So I took Minnie home, and then as you're the nicest family I know, I brought her here

57
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,720
so you could make her visible again.

58
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,560
You were very flattered, of course, too, Tiki.

59
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
But, uh...

60
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,320
If anyone could do it, you and Moman Mama can, and Moman can play with her.

61
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,240
Because she'd talk at all to Tiki.

62
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
I'm afraid not.

63
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Not since she became invisible.

64
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
Oh, dear.

65
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,160
I'm sure I can think of lots of games, but it'll be hard to play if I can't see her.

66
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,680
She'll be really good at hiding seat, though.

67
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,160
Oh, it's okay.

68
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,160
You'll know where she is because her aunt hung a little bell around her neck.

69
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,760
Ah, look, the door's opened.

70
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
That'll be nanny.

71
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
Come here, nanny.

72
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,320
It's all right.

73
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Don't be frightened.

74
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Come and meet everyone.

75
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,320
This is your new home, and this is Moman Mama and Moman Papa.

76
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
They're both very nice.

77
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Hello, I'm Moman, and these are my friends.

78
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
We were just having some tea.

79
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Would you like some?

80
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Oh, that is, if you can drink.

81
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,320
Oh, perhaps I should make some lemonade.

82
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Well, now, perhaps you'd all like to go back to the table, eh?

83
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
If you'd care to sit down, nanny.

84
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,320
I'm sorry I don't know any more about her,

85
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,320
but I'm sure that everything will be okay now she's here.

86
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
I'm certain it will.

87
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
We'll do our best, Tiki.

88
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Here you are, nanny.

89
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Well, she seems to be okay now, so I better be getting along.

90
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
I've got a lot of things to do.

91
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,320
I'll try and come over to see how you're all going.

92
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
That would really be nice.

93
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Oh, it's better.

94
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
You have got room, haven't you?

95
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Didn't you have someone else stand?

96
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
Ah, yes.

97
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
A thing I mean, Bob, but it's all right.

98
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
They left last week.

99
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
That's okay then.

100
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Oh, you must have been thirsty.

101
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Would you like some more?

102
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Sure.

103
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Oh, are you coming up with me?

104
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
That's nice, nanny.

105
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,320
This is your very own room.

106
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,320
You'll be warm and cozy here.

107
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,320
I've put the lemonade on the table,

108
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,320
so you can have a drink whenever you want.

109
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Are you sure you wouldn't like something to eat?

110
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,320
Ah, I see, you want to go to bed.

111
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Well, you had a busy day, so you must be tired out.

112
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Don't forget, if you feel frightened or lonely during the night,

113
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,320
just come and wake me up and we'll have a talk.

114
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,320
If you like, you can tinkle your little bell in my ear,

115
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,320
and that should do it, nanny dear.

116
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,320
Sweet dreams. Sleep well.

117
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
She asleep?

118
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Yes.

119
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,320
I was wondering whether there's anything that might help her

120
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,320
in your granny's book of household remedies.

121
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
I don't know if there's a cure for invisibility.

122
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,320
I can't remember, but I'll have a look.

123
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,320
There's a remedy for most things.

124
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
I'm a phone believer in granny's remedy.

125
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,320
I know you are dear. I'll go and see.

126
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
I wonder what you looked like.

127
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Ah, there it is.

128
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Now then, a droopy tail, evil eye, melancholy.

129
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Ah, this must be it.

130
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,320
The prescription was at the end of the book,

131
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,320
and shakily written, but it looked like the right one.

132
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,320
It said, remedy for when people start getting misty

133
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
and difficult to see.

134
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
It was very complicated.

135
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
I wonder whether it's the right one.

136
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,320
I wonder whether it's the right one.

137
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,320
I wonder whether it's the right one.

138
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,320
I wonder whether it's the right one.

139
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
I wonder whether it's the right one.

140
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Do you think it's going to work, Mama?

141
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Granny's remedies usually do, so don't worry.

142
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Yes, you're right.

143
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,320
I wonder whether we ought to go and wake her up.

144
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Look, you can see many shoes.

145
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Papa! Papa!

146
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Oh, good morning, little my.

147
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Is Ninny up yet?

148
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Yeah, she is.

149
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Where is she? She hasn't eaten yet, has she?

150
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,320
I don't know, and she's probably in the dining room.

151
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Oh, no!

152
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
I'm too late!

153
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
I'd be quiet, you two.

154
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Ninny's just finishing her breakfast.

155
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Come on, drink it all up.

156
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
That's good.

157
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,320
It should start to work in a couple of hours.

158
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Well done, Ninny.

159
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Look, her shoes are floating.

160
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Yeah, and soon we'll be seeing the rest of her.

161
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Ha, they look silly.

162
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
I think they're very nice feet.

163
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
I know who and Mama's remedies are good,

164
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
but I can't see them working that fast.

165
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,320
Anyway, you must look pretty bad if you want to make yourself invisible.

166
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Don't let little my upset you, Ninny.

167
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,320
It's only the way she talks.

168
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
She doesn't mean it.

169
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Oh, yes, I do.

170
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
I'm bored, Moomin.

171
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Well, what shall we do then, Moomin?

172
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
I don't know.

173
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Let's go mushroom picking.

174
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
That's boring, I never find any.

175
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Well, I do.

176
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Would you like to come, Ninny?

177
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,320
Good, and we can see who can pick the most, shall we?

178
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
They all look the same to me,

179
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,320
so you'll have to tell me which ones are safe to eat.

180
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
I'll tell you.

181
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Papa! Papa!

182
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Look, Papa, you can see Ninny's shoes now.

183
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Oh, that's good.

184
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
There's not many things Mama's potions won't cure.

185
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Oh, it can't be that.

186
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
She only took it a minute ago.

187
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Well, it might be that it works faster if you're completely invisible.

188
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,320
I think it's being away from that horrid out.

189
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Yes, it could be.

190
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Mama, we're taking Ninny mushroom picking.

191
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
Have a nice time.

192
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,320
Morning!

193
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Morning!

194
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Hello.

195
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Where's Ninny?

196
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Oh!

197
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Huh!

198
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Wow, what a lot of mushrooms!

199
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,320
You seem to know where to find all the best ones, Ninny.

200
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,320
It's so fair. I haven't gotten half as many.

201
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,320
How are you doing, Momen?

202
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,320
Wow, that must be about four times as many as I've got.

203
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,320
Uh, yeah, that's right.

204
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,320
You've never picked that many before.

205
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,320
You know, Momen, I think there's something fishy about this.

206
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Uh-huh, so they're not yours at all.

207
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Well, not really, no.

208
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Ninny's enjoyed herself.

209
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,320
I bet her yucky old aunt never let her go mushroom picking.

210
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,320
She was probably only allowed to carry the baskets, the really heavy ones.

211
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Oh, how awful for her.

212
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
They're stinky.

213
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
What's he up to now?

214
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
I'll take care of him.

215
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Hello, Momen, long time no see.

216
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Not long enough.

217
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Last time you dipped my swimming shorts in glue.

218
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
You know, I thought that was very funny.

219
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Hey, what's that basket floating around up there for?

220
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,320
I don't want to be rude, but mind your own business.

221
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
It looks like the Hobgoblins work.

222
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,320
Boy, just think of all the things you could do if you were invisible.

223
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Ninny, I'll carry your basket.

224
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Let's go.

225
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,320
It stinks here.

226
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Hey, you!

227
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Isn't it me a name or just a description?

228
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,320
What's wrong? Is your voice invisible, too?

229
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Please stop it, stinky.

230
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Can't you see you're frightening her?

231
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Oh, it's a girl, is it?

232
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Why doesn't she speak for herself?

233
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,320
She's stupid. What a perfect name for her, Ninny.

234
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Now look, stinky.

235
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Oh, yes, Momen. Now look what?

236
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,320
You stop upsetting Ninny or I'll get really angry.

237
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,320
Without those feet, she'd be perfect for a back robbery.

238
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Well, she's getting visible again, so she'll be no good to you at all, stinky.

239
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,320
You couldn't see any of her yesterday, not even the feet.

240
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
They're disappearing again.

241
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,320
You have to do a scare of it.

242
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Oh, see? She's gone.

243
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,320
It's all your fault, stinky.

244
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Yes, and like I told you before, she'd make a brilliant back robbery.

245
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Don't you agree? Perfect.

246
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Ninny would never do such a thing as that.

247
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,320
And anyway, Mama's given her one of Granny's magic remedies.

248
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,320
She'll soon be visible again, so they're there.

249
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,320
Whose basket is this?

250
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Mine in little mice.

251
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Well, there's not many of them, but they certainly are pretty.

252
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,320
There weren't many left for us to get, because Ninny has picked them all.

253
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,320
It doesn't really matter how many you've got because you can't eat them.

254
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Let me show you.

255
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Now, this is deadly, tufted toadstool.

256
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
And this is cow's bane.

257
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,320
You must remember what they look like.

258
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Ah, these are movements and sniff, I should think.

259
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
We didn't pick any poisoners once.

260
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,320
Not quite as many as snorkemaiden and little mice, but this is body fly bane

261
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
and insiduous pepper spunk.

262
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
And you've both got cow's bane, too.

263
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
You must be more careful.

264
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Now, this is better.

265
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,320
There's not one mushroom in here that you can't eat.

266
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,320
How did Ninny manage to do this all on her own?

267
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
What a very clever girl she is.

268
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Ninny, where are you?

269
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Come here a minute.

270
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Ninny, didn't you hear?

271
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Mama wants you.

272
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Ninny, this is a beautiful mushroom basket.

273
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
We'll have a feast tonight.

274
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,320
Her feet have come back.

275
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Oh, I'm so glad.

276
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
We'll soon be able to see your face.

277
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
It won't take long at all, Ninny.

278
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
And you mustn't worry about stinky one little bit.

279
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
He's all talk.

280
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,320
If something upsets you, just think of something else.

281
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,320
At least that's my philosophy in life.

282
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,320
If somebody upsets you, ignore him.

283
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
That's my philosophy, Ninny.

284
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Anyone who picks mushrooms like this deserves to be seen.

285
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,320
You mustn't let anything frighten you when you're with us.

286
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
Do you understand?

287
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.

288
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
That's just great, Ninny.

289
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Oh, that's wonderful, Ninny.

290
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
Wonderful.

291
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
I can't wait to see all of you.

292
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
It won't be long now.

293
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,320
But I don't think Mouse Gray is quite your color, you know.

294
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
You just sleep as long as you like, Ninny.

295
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
Good night now.

296
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
If you want anything, you just shout.

297
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Oh, where's Mom and Mama?

298
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,320
Well, well, what are you doing?

299
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,320
I mean, do you know what time it is?

300
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,320
Do you like this moment, Papa?

301
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Hmm.

302
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,320
Yes, it's very nice.

303
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,320
It's good to have someone in the house to make clothes for it last.

304
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
I hope it'll look pretty on her.

305
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
What's this for?

306
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Her hair.

307
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,320
praise.

308
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:13,320
ok

309
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
Good morning mum and Papa.

310
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Good morning little Mai.

311
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,320
You're very early today.

312
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
You're a burly?

313
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
I can't wait to see her.

314
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,320
Come on, man.

315
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,320
It's like waiting for Christmas, isn't it?

316
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Yeah, I like having presents every day.

317
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
Isn't it, Papa?

318
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,320
Well, I think it's much more exciting this way.

319
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,320
We have to wait until she's ready to come down.

320
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Did you hear that door opening?

321
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
She's awake!

322
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,320
I hope she found the dress where I left it on the table.

323
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Oh, good.

324
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
It's all right.

325
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Now, you know where to look.

326
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Well, it's time to go to bed.

327
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Oh, good.

328
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,320
It's all right.

329
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,320
Now, you know where to look.

330
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,320
Well, she's OK, I suppose.

331
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Thank you all very much for everything.

332
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Oh.

333
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,320
Ha! So she can talk!

334
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
They still couldn't see Nini's face.

335
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
But at least they knew that she was there,

336
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
that she was talking to them.

337
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
I've made them all feel a lot better.

338
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,320
Stork made them. Look!

339
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:13,320
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the romance.

340
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:21,320
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

341
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,320
They're always happy and always at play.

342
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,320
The movements are having fun day after day.

343
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,320
The movements.

344
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,320
The movements.

345
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:41,320
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

346
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:51,320
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

347
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,320
They're always happy and always at play.
