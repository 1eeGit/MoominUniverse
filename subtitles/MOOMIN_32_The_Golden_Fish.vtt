00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land.

00:36.000 --> 00:46.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:46.000 --> 00:59.000
there was the movements, there was the movements, there was the movements, there was the movements,

00:59.000 --> 01:20.720
When the Hennian first told Mumen about the golden fish, Mumen thought to himself that

01:20.720 --> 01:22.720
But it must look something like this.

01:29.720 --> 01:33.720
My grandpa told me that his mother had actually seen it.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.720
So you never saw it yourself, Mr. Hemion?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.720
No, I'm a batonist.

01:37.720 --> 01:41.720
It comes to the surface only under very special conditions.

01:41.720 --> 01:43.720
It's very rarely seen.

01:43.720 --> 01:44.720
Conditions?

01:44.720 --> 01:45.720
Yes.

01:45.720 --> 01:48.720
First of all, it must be right between summer and autumn.

01:49.720 --> 01:50.720
But that's now.

01:50.720 --> 01:51.720
Yes.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.720
It has to be in the afternoon sunshine after heavy rain.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.720
Yes, that does narrow it down.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.720
And there must be no wind.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.720
Grandpa said not even a ripple on the water.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.720
Oh dear.

02:02.720 --> 02:07.720
And there are some other conditions that he really didn't know about anyway to see it.

02:07.720 --> 02:09.720
You must be extremely lucky.

02:11.720 --> 02:12.720
Hmm.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.720
Just getting to the lake itself isn't too easy.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.720
It's way beyond lonely mountains.

02:19.720 --> 02:23.720
Going over lonely mountains and back would take at least two days.

02:23.720 --> 02:26.720
Not really, because I know a shortcut movement.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.720
I could take you there and back in one day.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.720
Oh, could you do that?

02:30.720 --> 02:31.720
Yes.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.720
Have you already been there, Snuffkin?

02:33.720 --> 02:35.720
Just once.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.720
Oh, will you show me the way?

02:37.720 --> 02:38.720
You really want to go?

02:38.720 --> 02:39.720
Yes.

02:39.720 --> 02:43.720
I must see that golden fish with my own eyes and maybe capture it.

02:43.720 --> 02:45.720
It won't be easy to capture.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.720
Why not?

02:47.720 --> 02:50.720
From what I've heard, the golden fish is far too clever to get caught.

02:50.720 --> 02:53.720
I know, but it would be so much fun.

02:53.720 --> 02:54.720
You going alone?

02:54.720 --> 02:57.720
Well, Snorkmaiden said she wanted to come along.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.720
She gets these ideas, you know.

02:59.720 --> 03:00.720
Just Snorkmaiden?

03:00.720 --> 03:01.720
Uh, maybe a little my.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.720
What about Sniff?

03:03.720 --> 03:05.720
I think he wants to come along, too.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.720
What about you?

03:07.720 --> 03:10.720
In that case, we'd better go across the mountains.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.720
Why is that? Why can't we take the shortcut?

03:12.720 --> 03:15.720
The path is rather steep and dangerous, you know, Moomin.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.720
Especially in the forest of witches.

03:18.720 --> 03:19.720
Hide the witches?

03:19.720 --> 03:20.720
Not now, maybe.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.720
Oh, so it's safe then.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.720
But it's a very deep forest dark and scary even in daytime.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.720
That's okay, we'll take the shortcut.

03:31.720 --> 03:32.720
Hmm.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.720
Oh, dear.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.720
Come on.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.720
Good morning, Snuffkin.

04:16.720 --> 04:17.720
Oh.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.720
Sorry, Snuffkin, guess I overslept.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.720
Snorkmaiden a little my, aren't here yet.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.720
You're very early.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.720
Hmm, I dreamt I caught the golden fish,

04:35.720 --> 04:37.720
and then, of course, I couldn't go back to sleep.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.720
Well, let's go.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.720
Shouldn't we wait for Snorkmaiden a little my?

04:41.720 --> 04:44.720
Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?

04:44.720 --> 04:48.720
And anyway, didn't we decide that we wouldn't wait for anybody?

04:48.720 --> 04:50.720
So it might be better this way.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.720
What's better this way, Moomin?

04:52.720 --> 04:54.720
Oh, little my.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.720
Why don't you stay here?

04:56.720 --> 04:58.720
This will be a very tough expedition.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.720
I'm tougher than you.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.720
Wait for me.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.720
Hey, walk any faster, Snuffkin.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.720
I'm still so sleepy.

05:13.720 --> 05:16.720
Why did we have to leave so early, Moomin?

05:16.720 --> 05:18.720
To get there back in a day, Snorkmaiden.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.720
But we aren't taking the shortcut, are we?

05:20.720 --> 05:23.720
Yes, but it still might get dark before we're back.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.720
I won't be able to walk back this fast, you know,

05:25.720 --> 05:28.720
because my bucket will be full of water for the golden fish.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.720
Well, don't be disappointed if you don't catch it.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.720
But that's my whole reason for going.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.720
But you heard what the Himmelin said, Snuff?

05:36.720 --> 05:39.720
We'll be extremely lucky to even catch sight of the golden fish.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.720
I heard him and now's exactly the right time.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.720
Maybe the others made too much noise.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.720
We'll just have to wait and see.

05:47.720 --> 05:49.720
Don't you worry, I'll catch him all right.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.720
Where are they going sorely in the morning?

06:06.720 --> 06:08.720
How far is the forest of witches?

06:08.720 --> 06:10.720
I'd say about two hours.

06:10.720 --> 06:15.720
And can you also tell us how long from one end of the forest to the other, Snuffkin?

06:15.720 --> 06:17.720
About the same.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.720
Are there really such things as witches?

06:22.720 --> 06:23.720
No.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.720
Baby, because I'm not a bit scared of them.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.720
Aren't you?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.720
Not the least little bit.

06:28.720 --> 06:29.720
There used to be some, though.

06:29.720 --> 06:30.720
What witches?

06:30.720 --> 06:31.720
Well, of course, sniff.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.720
What helps do you think that they call it the forest of witches, huh?

06:34.720 --> 06:37.720
And you're absolutely sure that there are no witches now.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.720
I haven't heard of any coming back.

06:40.720 --> 06:41.720
Mm-hmm.

06:41.720 --> 06:45.720
So you're not absolutely sure that there are no witches?

06:52.720 --> 06:55.720
Where's Moominer still in bed?

06:55.720 --> 06:57.720
He was off before you woke up, Papa.

06:57.720 --> 06:58.720
Mm.

06:58.720 --> 07:01.720
Oh, the golden fish.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.720
Good morning, dear.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.720
I wanted to go with him.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.720
Are you writing your memoirs you're far too busy?

07:08.720 --> 07:09.720
Mm-hmm.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.720
That's very true with the thought of a fish that no one has seen.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.720
That might have been a whole chapter.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.720
Do you think they'll catch it?

07:17.720 --> 07:20.720
No, I doubt it very much. It's highly unlikely.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.720
In that case, you should have gone with them.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.720
No, I do know a thing or two about fishing.

07:25.720 --> 07:28.720
Snuffkin does, too, but he's still so young.

07:28.720 --> 07:31.720
Oh, don't worry. I'm sure Snuffkin will manage.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.720
Oh, this is a spooky forest.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.720
Maybe the witch is every time.

07:37.720 --> 07:38.720
Stop it, little lion.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.720
Listen, everybody. Don't stray away from me.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.720
Promise you might get lost.

08:02.720 --> 08:03.720
Oh!

08:07.720 --> 08:09.720
Oh!

08:09.720 --> 08:11.720
Oh!

08:11.720 --> 08:14.720
It's so dark in here.

08:14.720 --> 08:19.720
Sure is, and so thick the sun can't get through.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.720
That's because of those clouds.

08:25.720 --> 08:28.720
I can hear the wind, but we need calm.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.720
Yes, but we also need heavy rain.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.720
You're right. That's what the Hemiellin said.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.720
It sure looks like rain.

08:35.720 --> 08:37.720
Not only looks like...

08:39.720 --> 08:41.720
Oh, it's raining.

08:57.720 --> 08:58.720
Here.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.720
Thank you.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.720
I gotta say, this rainstorm was very sudden.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.720
Don't worry. It won't last that long.

09:08.720 --> 09:09.720
How do you know that?

09:09.720 --> 09:11.720
Vagabons do.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.720
This rain isn't that heavy.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.720
No, it's not bad, but we better hurryer.

09:15.720 --> 09:19.720
We won't get to lake till noon, and that'll be too late.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.720
I don't think we'll get very wet down here, Mum.

09:22.720 --> 09:23.720
And so why don't we move on?

09:23.720 --> 09:25.720
You're so excited.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.720
What should we do with Snuffkin?

09:28.720 --> 09:30.720
Well, we could move on, couldn't we?

09:46.720 --> 09:50.720
We really aren't getting too wet.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.720
We better find some shelter quickly.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.720
But where can we shelter?

09:54.720 --> 09:56.720
There's nothing in this wood-exec tree.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.720
I'm gonna eat tree then, I guess.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.720
Yeah!

10:01.720 --> 10:03.720
What is it, Snuffkin?

10:03.720 --> 10:05.720
There's a house over there.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.720
It's fallen to rock and ruin.

10:13.720 --> 10:16.720
Well, at least it'll keep the rain off.

10:27.720 --> 10:36.720
Hello there, anyone home?

10:36.720 --> 10:39.720
There's nobody here.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.720
No one's lived here for a long time.

10:53.720 --> 10:57.720
I wonder who could have been who lived here all alone.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.720
I know who it was, and so do we all, don't we?

11:08.720 --> 11:10.720
Surely you don't mean.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.720
The winches, of course.

11:14.720 --> 11:21.720
Look around for dried spices, magic herbs, broomsticks, and a black cat, an iron pot.

11:22.720 --> 11:23.720
Appile.

11:23.720 --> 11:24.720
But no broom.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.720
No, the witch rode away on it.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.720
There's someone here.

11:33.720 --> 11:34.720
Who is it?

11:41.720 --> 11:43.720
Let's get out of here.

11:43.720 --> 11:45.720
Came from over there.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.720
No, that's okay, Snuffkin.

11:53.720 --> 11:55.720
We gotta get out of this place.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.720
I can't move, Snuffkin.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.720
Stinky?

12:13.720 --> 12:14.720
Pretty good.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.720
I bet you were really scared.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.720
I wasn't a bit scared, Stinky.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.720
It's very rude of snip to faint when he hears my voice.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.720
Where are you off to anyway?

12:26.720 --> 12:28.720
Oh, come on, tell me.

12:28.720 --> 12:29.720
Can't seem to take a joke.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.720
Come on, wait for me.

12:46.720 --> 12:47.720
That way.

12:48.720 --> 12:49.720
Okay.

12:50.720 --> 12:51.720
Come on.

13:18.720 --> 13:19.720
This is it, isn't it?

13:19.720 --> 13:20.720
Yes it is.

13:20.720 --> 13:21.720
Where's the golden fish?

13:21.720 --> 13:22.720
I really don't know.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.720
I've never seen it either.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.720
With rain, sunshine, and calm, I'm sure the fish will come.

13:27.720 --> 13:28.720
The golden fish?

13:28.720 --> 13:29.720
Help me catch it.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.720
I just gotta have that golden fish.

13:47.720 --> 13:48.720
Oh.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.720
It's deep down in here somewhere.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.720
I can't see any fish anywhere.

14:07.720 --> 14:10.720
Maybe it was Hemiellin's idea of a very funny joke.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.720
The Hemiellin doesn't joke.

14:14.720 --> 14:15.720
Let's sit down and wait.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.720
I'm sure the golden fish will appear for us.

14:18.720 --> 14:19.720
I don't believe it.

14:19.720 --> 14:23.720
Do you mean to say you came all this way here just to see some stupid old fish?

14:23.720 --> 14:24.720
I came to catch it.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.720
Well, that's even more stupid.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.720
Hey, stop making those ripples.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.720
So they really got excited and walked all the way, you say?

14:36.720 --> 14:38.720
Oh, to be young again.

14:38.720 --> 14:42.720
Well, I would have gone with them if I hadn't over slept.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.720
I didn't know that you were that young woman, Papa.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.720
Oh, I'm not exactly old, you know.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.720
Pretty interesting to see a fish that hardly anyone's ever seen.

14:53.720 --> 14:57.720
Snip said that he would catch this golden fish if it's the last thing he did.

14:57.720 --> 14:58.720
Oh, how?

14:58.720 --> 15:02.720
Well, he had a net and a very large bucket to carry at home, then.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.720
That's a good one.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.720
What do you mean?

15:08.720 --> 15:11.720
I guess I must have forgotten to tell you all the details.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.720
There's so much you don't know about this fish.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.720
Can't see it from up here.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.720
Oh, the hemulin was certainly right.

15:27.720 --> 15:31.720
Hardly anyone has seen this golden fish and we're not going to see it either.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.720
Maybe somebody ate him years ago.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.720
Stinky, be quiet, please.

15:38.720 --> 15:39.720
Did you see it?

15:39.720 --> 15:40.720
Where did you see it?

15:42.720 --> 15:43.720
Huh?

15:43.720 --> 15:47.720
I saw a fish jump, but I couldn't tell if it was golden.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.720
It was much too far away.

15:49.720 --> 15:52.720
With the sun over there, we'd just see the outlines, Nork Maiden.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.720
Yes, we couldn't really see the color.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.720
Look, everybody, look!

15:56.720 --> 15:58.720
I can see a raft over there!

15:59.720 --> 16:02.720
Hey, let's take it and go out to the middle of the lake.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.720
But it's much too small for all of us.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.720
Don't worry, Snip. This won't sink.

16:12.720 --> 16:13.720
I'm staying.

16:13.720 --> 16:17.720
You do what you like, but you'll never catch any fish if you're afraid of water.

16:19.720 --> 16:22.720
Stinky, you can help me. It's gold, you know.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.720
We can sell it for a lot of money and then we'll both be very wealthy.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.720
I think it was somewhere around here, wasn't it?

16:40.720 --> 16:43.720
We're less, I suppose, hard to say.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.720
Well, I can't see anything.

16:45.720 --> 16:46.720
I can't see!

16:46.720 --> 16:49.720
There's certainly no sign of it now.

16:50.720 --> 16:53.720
Well, we'll just have to sit and wait here.

16:54.720 --> 16:55.720
We have no choice.

16:55.720 --> 16:59.720
And I'm not going home until I've seen it. I'm happy to wait all day.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.720
You won't find it by looking up at the sky.

17:02.720 --> 17:07.720
You know what? Fish like it in places where there are lots of wings.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.720
Oh, the rafts in the middle of the lake.

17:10.720 --> 17:14.720
And they just want to see the fish, but you wait, I'm going to catch it.

17:14.720 --> 17:19.720
Maybe somebody's already caught it and you can get it in a tin.

17:24.720 --> 17:25.720
What did you see?

17:25.720 --> 17:27.720
Over there, something shiny jumping!

17:27.720 --> 17:31.720
What did you see? Ditorger, now keep quiet.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.720
I hate fishing.

17:40.720 --> 17:44.720
Guess we better think about getting back otherwise we'll never get home before nightfall.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.720
I don't want to get lost on a raft in the dark on this lonely lake.

17:47.720 --> 17:50.720
Perhaps we were expecting too much.

17:50.720 --> 17:54.720
Maybe your right's not made in, but I really thought we'd see it.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.720
This is the most disappointing day of my life.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.720
We can come back.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.720
Yes.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.720
It's not gonna stop.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.720
Did you see a moment?

18:52.720 --> 18:54.720
It's gigantic.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.720
Oh!

19:43.720 --> 19:45.720
We've seen!

19:45.720 --> 19:47.720
Oh, that was right!

19:47.720 --> 19:49.720
I really saw it!

19:50.720 --> 19:52.720
I saw it!

20:13.720 --> 20:15.720
I did it, I caught it!

20:15.720 --> 20:16.720
God, what?

20:16.720 --> 20:18.720
Why the golden fish, of course?

20:18.720 --> 20:19.720
What?

20:19.720 --> 20:22.720
I've got the golden fish in here if you want to have a look at it.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.720
See, it's in this bucket.

20:26.720 --> 20:29.720
You don't really believe that is the golden fish.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.720
It's just another stupid fish.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.720
I can swear that it really was golden when I caught it.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.720
It must have been the sun making it land in the water.

20:40.720 --> 20:43.720
It was you said it was the golden fish.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.720
Why don't you let it go?

20:44.720 --> 20:47.720
You know it's not the right one and he hates it in that bucket.

20:55.720 --> 20:56.720
There he goes.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.720
It looks so happy now.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.720
It really was golden when I first saw it.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.720
We believe you, Sniff.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.720
Now let's go home.

21:15.720 --> 21:19.720
Sniff and Stinky never really got over their belief.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.720
It was actually the golden fish they had caught.

21:22.720 --> 21:26.720
But moving in the others were in no doubt about what they had seen.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.720
They and the emulators were great friends.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.720
They were great friends.

21:46.720 --> 21:47.720
They were great friends.

21:47.720 --> 21:48.720
They were great friends.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.720
They were great friends.

21:50.720 --> 21:51.720
They were great friends.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.720
They were great friends.

21:52.720 --> 21:53.720
They were great friends.

21:53.720 --> 21:54.720
They were great friends.

21:54.720 --> 21:55.720
They were great friends.

21:55.720 --> 21:56.720
They were great friends.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.720
They were great friends.

21:57.720 --> 21:58.720
They were great friends.

21:58.720 --> 21:59.720
They were great friends.

21:59.720 --> 22:00.720
They were great friends.

22:00.720 --> 22:01.720
They were great friends.

22:01.720 --> 22:02.720
They were great friends.

22:02.720 --> 22:03.720
They were great friends.

22:03.720 --> 22:04.720
They were great friends.

22:04.720 --> 22:05.720
They were great friends.

22:05.720 --> 22:06.720
They were great friends.

22:06.720 --> 22:07.720
They were great friends.

22:07.720 --> 22:08.720
They were great friends.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.720
They were great friends.

22:09.720 --> 22:10.720
They were great friends.

22:10.720 --> 22:11.720
They were great friends.

22:11.720 --> 22:12.720
They were great friends.

22:12.720 --> 22:13.720
They were great friends.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.720
They were great friends.
