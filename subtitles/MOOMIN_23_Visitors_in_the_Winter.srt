1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,560
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:32,720
me here for you on your TV they are the movements they are the movements so come with me give me your hand

3
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:41,280
I'll take you up to a movement land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there

4
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:56,720
with the movements there was the movements there was the movements

5
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll take you up to a movement land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,280
during the long winter in movement valley almost everybody living there hibernates until the sunshine

7
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:53,680
comes again in the spring but for some reason movement and little my woke up in the middle of it

8
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:01,360
we couldn't get back to sleep ah this is great I'm really starving I hope there's lots

9
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,640
oh there's plenty left no one thought she'd made too much this year but it's lucky for us she did

10
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,560
I don't know what we'd have to eat otherwise

11
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:21,360
shh they're still sleeping well at least you got me to play with movement

12
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:46,320
and that was fun what are you ever going to move in I'm probably a bit heavy for it so get

13
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,360
something else dummy I might later anyway I thought we were going to see tuteki come on I'll pull you okay

14
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,600
I know why you don't want to go move in you're scared of sliding down from the top aren't you

15
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,800
no of course I'm not

16
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:21,200
tuteki's not here I wonder where she's gone to that's her over there isn't it oh yeah I think it is

17
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,960
jay movement she looks like she's sliding sliding yes it's obvious she's sliding of course

18
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:38,000
she's coming over what were you going out there tuteki watching the sun go down

19
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,280
it's the only place you can see it from I just caught it for it disappeared over the horizon

20
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,480
where did it go to it comes up again in the south and we'll probably shine on snuff can

21
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,120
hey tuteki what are those things you got on your feet they're called skates and they're the

22
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,880
best thing possible for moving across the ice quickly just what I need come on show me how to do

23
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:09,200
it yes okay that's great I'm going to make myself some skates too it's not as easy as you think

24
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,800
little lie pathetic I need a sort of knife on your shoes and that sounds easy enough to me

25
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:24,720
you know it's strange but I've got a funny kind of feeling that there's someone else apart

26
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,640
from us in the bathhouse well there is who is it where are they little my you can't see them

27
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,440
huh what do you mean I can't see them where are they hiding in the cupboard no they're invisible look

28
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:53,920
I'll show you see that's two of the shoe mice there are eight of them all together now don't

29
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:03,280
walk on the line I didn't see any shoe mice here in the summer although if they're invisible I

30
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,040
wouldn't have done no probably not as in the summer when we come across new little animals that

31
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,520
we've never seen before and who likes snuffkin go away when the wind and snow comes then when the

32
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,080
days are shorter and everyone else is hibernating they come out and some are so shy they're invisible

33
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,680
and there I'm afraid I don't understand winter at all well of course you don't you moments have

34
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,800
always slept through and don't know very much about it oh I can't wait to tell mummer and

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,360

37
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,840
go on sleeping and sleeping until spring well we woke up today so but we don't know about tomorrow

38
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,120
no of course not we'll have to wait and see if we're awake we'll know and if we're asleep then

39
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:09,280
it doesn't matter hmm well if I'm not awake and you are wake me up okay mummin is all right go to

41
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:22,000

42
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440

well they're skis didn't you see me come down yes I did can you slide on the ice with these and

48

50
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000

52
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,880

53
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,840
young lady don't worry it will be for me everything is once I decide to do it

54
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,840
oh so you spend all year going where the snow is that must be tiring not at all life should

55
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,920
be a struggle this jam is really good does it always have to be winter catch a struggle in spring

56
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,440
and summer instead well no that would be too easy you could just sit back and relax no you've

57
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,600
got a face up to the cold and exercise to keep warm oh that sounds very interesting mr brisk

58
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,840
one clear cold bath a day keeps all those unnecessary thoughts away my own little poem

59
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,000
what you don't mean you swim in this weather do you the water must be very close to freezing

60
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,400
well the seas a lot colder than that it is frozen is there a river yes there is but the water

61
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:58,640
looks very very cold sounds just right have you got any more of this wonderful jam it's delicious

63
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,880

80
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,400
well you might feel it but nobody can see it for a star wolves are much bigger than you

81
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,240
i want to go and find them and then we can all hell at the moon i've been practicing

82
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,360

95
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:13,040
mr brisk says that he's gonna teach me oh i can't move my legs tied up like this

96
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,880
that's the whole point you don't have to you just move your skis easy is winking

97
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,120
first of all you have to learn how to fall properly

98
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,960
but if i learn to ski first then i won't move

99
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,320
little my husky too well they're just made from an old barrel yours are much more sophisticated

100
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,120
now then vangernie's and lean forward are you ready i don't think i like this it's too steep can i

101
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,760
practice on something a bit flatter well maybe next time now then off you roll

102
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,280
trying to start navel and movement you know i think this hill is even steeper than the last one

103
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,640
nothing to worry about you've already mastered falling down off you go

104
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
oh

105
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,200
oh stop me please you can do it yourself just calm down

106
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,000
oh look at that harvest you need

107
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
please someone stop me please

108
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
oh

109
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,640
that was terrific moment let's do it again

110
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
what are you looking at sorry you i can hear all my brothers howling out there

111
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,280
they're probably hungry and looking for food no i know they're calling me

112
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:16,560
i'm going to see them i've really got to a moment

113
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,160
got anything no night yet i'm afraid there's going to be trouble we're running out of jam

114
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,000
mr. brisk i suppose you can't stop eating it when you have to ask him to leave i can't do that

115
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,760
well of course you can it's your home and you can choose who you have

116
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,560
a snowstorm is sweeping through the valley usually a sign that spring is not far away

117
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
oh

118
00:16:34,160 --> 00:17:01,880
Oh, hello, Mr. Brisk, look, I'm sorry, but all the jams gone.

119
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,480
And just an empty jar.

120
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Oh well, never mind, it was a great jam, but I have more important things on my mind.

121
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,480
You see, now that spring is here, I have to leave, Moomin Valley.

122
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,480
Oh, do you?

123
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Hmm, it's sad, but there you are, I have to go.

124
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Goodbye, Moomin.

125
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,480
Goodbye, Mr. Brisk.

126
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Keep some jam for me.

127
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,280
Uh.

128
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,080
Hello, I'm sorry, I'm your brother, I've wanted to be with you for a long, long time.

129
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,280
I'm afraid I'm not very braver strong, but if you'd let me stay with you.

130
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,080
Oh, don't you know me?

131
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Looks like I was wrong.

132
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,480
Oh, well, go on. Eat me if you want to.

133
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,480
It's a pity I didn't sleep at night instead of learning to howl.

134
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,080
Mum and I was right, I shouldn't have come.

135
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

136
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

137
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

138
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,080

I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

144
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

145
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

146
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

147
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

148
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,080

I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

151
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Hello little doggy, what are you doing here?

152

Have you been waiting for me?

153
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,080
We'll have a great time traveling around the world together.

154
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,080
Ah!

155
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
Ha!

156
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
Ha!

157
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
Ha!

158
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,080
See? Ha! Ha! Ha!

159
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,080
Ha! Ha!

160
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,080
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

161
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,080
Ding! Ding, ding, ding! Ding! Ding, ding!

162
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,080
BAM!

163
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
That was spring breaking through the ice.

164
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
Look at the theme moment, it's free again.

165
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
Well, little my, get back.

166
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
Oh.

167
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
Oh my goodness.

168
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:46,080
Little boy, hang on to me.

169
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
Thank you, woman.

170
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Let's go.

171
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,080
It's all right, women.

172
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,080
Don't panic, I'm with you.

173
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
You're okay.

174
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
Whoa.

175
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
It's all right, women.

176
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
Don't panic, I'm with you.

177
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
You're okay.

178
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
Whoa.

179
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
Oh.

180
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
Over there, women.

181
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,080
Quick, do.

182
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,080
See, if you do what I tell you, there's nothing to be afraid of.

183
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
Just trust me, women.

184
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
I'm always right, aren't I?

185
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,080
Yes, I know you are, little my, but we'd still better hurry.

186
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,080
Come on, you two, just a bit further.

187
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
Whoa.

188
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
Whoa.

189
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
It's cold in here.

190
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,080
Quickly, let's get inside and light a fire.

191
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
You'll soon warm up.

192
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
Phew.

193
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,080
And so Mr. Brisk and the ice both left woman valley

194
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:06,080
and spring returned once more after a long and eventful winter.

195
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:14,080
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

196
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

197
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,080
They're always happy and always at play.

198
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,080
The movements are having fun day after day.

199
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,080
The movements.

200
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,080
The movements.

201
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,080
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

202
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,080
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

203
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,080
They're always happy and always at play.

204
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,080
The movements are having fun day after day.

205
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,080
The movements.

206
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,080
The movements.

207
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,080
The movements.
