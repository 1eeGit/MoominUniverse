    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're here for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They are the movements.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, what do you think?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm going to say that I'm not going to say that. I'm going to say that I'm not going to say that. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:01:39.000

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.799
become shorter and the nights longer.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.120
The wind blows away the falling leaves, and the blue skies of summer are now gray and cloudy.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.640
Winter is just around the corner.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.920
Snork maiden!

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.560
Where are you going?

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.319
Oh, I'm just taking my brother, his lunch little my.

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.519
Hmm.

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:06.120
He must have nearly finished the flying ship by now.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.240
Oh no, not even Snork works that quickly.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.599
Well, have you seen it?

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.800
No, I haven't.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.039
He won't even let me come into his workshop.

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:17.800
Is he afraid it'll disappear if someone sees it?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.639
He hasn't said why, but I suppose all great inventors

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:21.960
have to be very careful.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.879
Someone might want to steal their ideas.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:25.139
Moment told me he's dying to have to be very careful. Someone might want to steal their ideas.

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:46.560
Movement told me he's dying to have a look at it. I've got my hands full. Come on, quickly! Look what I've got! It's a record player!

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.000
Ah!

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.800
Do you think you can get it working, dear?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.800
Oh, yes, of course, Mama.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.400
Why did people always give me things that are broken?

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.919
It'd be nice to have something that worked for a change.

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.879
Movement, Papa will get it working for you.

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.479
My auntie said that the record was all right, though.

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:16.599
It's dance music.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.080
She's had it for ages, but I've never heard it.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.080
Oh, that's nice.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.599
It's years since I danced, but it seems like only yesterday.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.039
Do you remember what funny was Papa?

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.199
Dancing.

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.360
Oh, yeah.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.680
I see.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.000
Have you fixed it, Papa?

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.719
Huh?

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:42.879
I can hear music.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:04:07.000
Doesn't sound like snuffkin! Right, have you got the idea now?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Yes, I think so. Me too!

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Come on! Let's see you then.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.000
May I? Come on! Well, let's see you then.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Meal?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Did I eat it?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Oh, wow!

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.800
Look at Papa Moon and he is a great dancer. Well, man, can you dance, Sniff?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.000
I've never tried.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Right, well, try now. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Oh, yeah.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Oh, yeah.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Oh, yeah.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Oh, yeah.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Oh, yeah.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Oh, yeah.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Oh, yeah.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Oh, yeah.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Oh, yeah.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh!

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Baby, baby, baby.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Oh, that was fun. Oh, Dan, you still wear me out like this.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
You've got no sense of rhythm at all, Sniff.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I can still dance, though, can I?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Oh, are you ready, Papa?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I think I'll have to sit this one out, Mom. All right.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Little Mide, no, thank you.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I'll dance on my own.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Well then, why don't you dance with me and dance, Smith?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Ah!

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Hmm.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Oh. Oh, it looks like it's here for the day.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Oh, what horrible weather, Snuffkin.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Yes.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
They're having fun.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Well, sniff brought this old record player over,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and we've been dancing.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I haven't done it for years and years,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and well, aren't you coming in?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I can smell winter in the air, Moomin' Papa.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Huh?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Oh, yes, you're right.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Snuffkin, why?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Snuffkin, come and answer me! No thanks, it's mine.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Sorry! I'm sorry!

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Oh, you!

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Hmm, what's the matter with this?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I'm afraid it's broken. Just when we were having so much fun. Will you be able to fix it again, dear? No, even I can't mend it now.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Oh, please, dry papa, will you?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Hmm.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Snuffkin, do you know anything about record players?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
No, I'm afraid not.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Oh, dear.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
But what?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I'll play my harmonic if you want to continue to dance.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And then you can fiddle around with the machine.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
How would that be? I'll play my harmonic if you want to continue to dance,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and then you can fiddle around with the machine.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
How would that be?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Oh, yes, please.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
That'd be great, Snuffkin.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Thanks.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.500
Now then, what would be a good tune to dance to?

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:27.000
Let's see. Oh Now what's this? Oh, no, I give up.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
May I?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Oh, no.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I give up.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
May I?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Oh, no. You're thinking about going away again, aren't you, Snowfken?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.779
I know that you go south every year when winter comes,

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:08.299
but I'll still miss you, though,

00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:11.600
and I wish you could stay here in Moomin Valley.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.379
I know, Moomin.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:22.820
Who are they?

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.259
How do you fathomers, I think?

00:09:24.259 --> 00:09:26.000
I wonder where they're going.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I don't know. A deserted island I expect.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Probably the best place for them.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
When are you leaving, self-kin?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Oh, I haven't decided yet.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So you'll be here for a bit longer then.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Do you know where you're going?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
No. It must be fun traveling.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Yes, most of the time.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
It's the best way of meeting new people and still being on your own.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I wish we could do that, but even when we hibernate and go to sleep, we're never really alone.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I guess I'd hibernate too if I had to stay up here a moment.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
During all the freezing winter snows.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.720
Do you think we could have a good time? Stay up here, movement. During all the freezing winter snows.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:17.519
Do you think I could go south with Snuffkin, Papa?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.440
Not really. It's the moment way to hibernate.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.399
It's a family custom passed down through the years

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:25.000
by our ancestors.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
But Papa, I don't want to go to sleep for months on end. I want to travel south with Snuffkin.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Oh, movement.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
You promise you'll be back on the first day of spring.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Oh, Mama! Does that mean I can really go?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I can't wait to tell Snuffkin. I can, can't I?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.740
Well, if you really want to, I don't suppose we'll stop you.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.740
We'll be Papa.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.580
Now my parents didn't mind when I traveled around in my youth,

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.580
so yes, or I'd more than...

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.580
Oh, thank you, Papa! Oh, thank you, Mama!

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:09.000
That's great, but what was Snuffkin say?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Well, it's a good idea. And I gotta say it'd be fun to have you a long woman.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So I can come with you, Snuffkin?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
No.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
What?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I'm sorry, but I've got to go on my own.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.799
Don't be disappointed, movement. I told you I travel alone.

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:26.799
I need to.

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:28.299
After spending the rest of the year here,

00:11:28.299 --> 00:11:29.600
just as I need to be here,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.299
after spending the winter alone,

00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:33.299
and the joy of returning to movement valley

00:11:33.299 --> 00:11:34.799
is something I wouldn't miss.

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:37.000
What's not, Ken? I thought...

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.500
The time will soon pass,

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.799
and you'll be asleep through most of it.

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:42.500
You won't notice I'm not here.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.639
I'll see you next spring, movement. I'll be back on the first

00:11:46.639 --> 00:12:06.000
day as usual, I promise, as soon as the weather waromin. Oh, it's all right. Oh, come on, Moomin.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
You'll have to tie them a bit tighter than that.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
It'll be a cold winter, so we'll need lots of water.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I'll be right back.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I'll be right back.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I'll be right back.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I'll be right back.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I'll be right back. a bit tighter than that.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
It'll be a cold winter, so we'll need lots of wood to keep us going till spring colors.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I know.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Now you want to stay warm, don't you?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
When I grow up, I'll go south on my own, too.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Yes, of course you will.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Is Mom in home? Yes.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
How is he? Is he still down in the dumps?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
I'm afraid so. Grandmoss cheer you up, recipe didn't work.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Oh, I think he's being silly just because Snuffkin's going away.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I suppose he is.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
But don't worry, mama.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:39.500
He won't be miserable much longer because I've got a surprise for him. Ah. Hmm.

00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:44.100
Are you there, Mom? A moment, don't cry.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.000
Boys don't cry, I suppose. Of course they do. Well, I'm not crying, so they're...

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
All right, but I do think you should get up now.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Oh, and why should I?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I have a surprise for you!

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I don't want any surprises.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Come on, I'm going to go and see Snorkin' his workshop.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
But you know he won't let us in.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
I've tried before.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Oh yes, he will today.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I promise.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
What?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
You mean Snorko's show is over?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I'm not going to let him in. I'm not going to let him in. I'm not going to let him in. I'm not going't let us in. I've tried before. Oh yes, he will today. I promise.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
What? You mean Snorkel shows his flying ship at last?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Yes, he said. Has he really finished it then?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
No, not yet. There's still a lot of work to do on it.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Then I wonder why he's letting us see it. He's always refused before.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
What's made him change his mind?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.799
But I asked him this time.

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:27.440
I said I wanted to show it to you.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.159
It just needed a woman's touch.

00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:31.120
What did you say to him?

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.120
First he said absolutely not.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.679
But when I told him how ill you were

00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:37.159
and that you probably wouldn't be with us much longer,

00:14:37.159 --> 00:14:39.600
he gave in and said we could see it just you and me

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.360
of climb up.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.080
That little snork maiden.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.200
Oh good.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.299
Because sometimes, and people are very depressed

00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:46.460
and just lying bad.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.100
They've done something bad.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.659
Oh, stop it snorked, maiden.

00:14:49.659 --> 00:14:51.100
Don't say things like that.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.580
I'm only trying to cheer you up.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.860
So remember, don't tell us all.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.820
No one else must know anything about it.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:07.000
Okay. Let's go.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
No.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
A little my.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Little my.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Trouble. No. Oh, little my. Little my.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Trouble.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Big Trouble.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
We must fool her.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Yes, but how?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
What can we do?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
I know what we'll do.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
What?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Quick, Moomin!

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
You just agree with everything I say, Snork Maiden.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Oh.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I thought you were in bad Moomin.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
No, we're going to see Snork.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Yes.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Really?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Yes, he needs to clear a runway for when the fly ship is finished.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
We're going to help him do it, that's all.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Yes.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Are you really, mumen?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
You got out of bad to do that.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I'm afraid I find it very strange that snork has asked to go along and help him cut down bushes and dig up roots and things.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
You might have noticed I'm not a complete fool.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.879
But it's true, little migh. Oh, yes things. You might have noticed I'm not a complete fool.

00:16:05.879 --> 00:16:07.320
But it's true, little mime.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.320
Oh, yes.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.679
Well, at least you could have invented a better lie.

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:15.120
You must think I'm pretty stupid to believe a pathetic story like that.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.840
But it's the truth.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.039
And we need your help.

00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:19.039
Yeah.

00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:20.039
Don't bother, don't bother.

00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:21.559
I don't want to hear anymore.

00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:24.159
I think it's very sad that you have to pretend.

00:16:24.159 --> 00:16:25.399
You're trying to hide something from me,

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:28.480
and I'm not interested in what sort of sneaky underhanded thing it is.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.559
But little mime?

00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:30.320
No, but...

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.600
And anyway, I'm a little too busy at the moment to take any notice of what's going on.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.600
Goodbye!

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.759
Come on.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.840
Oh, that was close.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:50.000
Yeah! Phew, that was close. Yeah.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Ha! Think, thank you. Keep a secret from me, do they?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Are you alone? Of course we are. I promised, didn't I?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Come in then.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Wow!

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
It's nearly ready, isn't it?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Oh no, there's a lot more to do.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
The machine isn't half finished yet.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And as you can see, there's a lot to do on the ship itself,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
but I'm getting there slowly.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
I never thought it would be so fantastic, smork.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Well, I suppose you could say the design wasn't a complete failure.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
I'm quite sure it'll fly beautifully.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Oh, thank you. Do you really think it will, woman?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
I can see it now. High open the air, dodging in and out of the clouds.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Way up above the world.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Well, I'm glad to see that you're so perceptive and quite right.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Oh, how very thoughtful of me.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Shouldn't you sit down and rest? You know your illness?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
It doesn't help to get too excited.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Ha, I shouldn't worry, Snork. There's nothing wrong with him.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Oh, little my, how did you get in here?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Throw that door!

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.039
But I always keep it oh oh oh no I

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:30.680
Must have forgotten to lock it and it's a bit late to do it now, isn't it?

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.759
But don't worry if I wanted to get in I'd get in locks or no locks

00:18:34.759 --> 00:18:41.319
Oh, you like to us little my of course, but so did you telling me that stupid story now or even right?

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.000
Now listen little my don't ever tell anybody what you see over here.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
All right!

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Ugh!

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
This invention contains so many outstanding new features

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
it is difficult to know where to begin.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:08.000
But let me start with the most exciting part of the whole construction.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:46.000
It could go as a tree or rather the concept of a tree, thrilling, beautiful, impossible, dangerous. Can you take the ship down, Moonman? I'd like you to land at that side of the lake. Oh, why do you want to get off?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Aren't you having fun flying about up here?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
I want to be on my own.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Oh, please stay here.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
I'll let you steer if you want.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
No, really, Moonman, please.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Bye now.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
No!

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Snowpeer! Bye now. No!

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Snuff me!

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Ugh! So long then, Moonman, my friend. I'll see you again next year. The first day of spring. Oh. Go by then, Snuffkin.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Off for the winter, eh, Snuffkin. Yes, goodbye Mr. Hemelin.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
We'll be seeing you in the spring.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Yes, when the snow's are gone.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Oh, to be young and winter came to Moomin Valley.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:06.000
And in Moomin's heart, snuffing and the spring seemed a long, long way away

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
They love the laughter and they love the living The movements

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
They're always happy and always at play

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.279
The movements are having fun day after day

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:30.480
The movements

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.640
The movements

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.319
They love the laughter and they love the living

00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:41.839
The movements

00:22:41.839 --> 00:22:44.880
They're leaving and sharing and caring

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:50.000
And giving the movements.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
They're always happy and goes at play.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
The Moons are having fun day after day.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:07.000
The Moons. The move is the move is
