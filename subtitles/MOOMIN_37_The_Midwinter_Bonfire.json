asleep then yes most of them anyway wonder if my brother's still up well he did say before we started hibernating he wanted to finish his blueprints before spring if he could I hope you'll succeed this time when you go out outside just to see what the snow looks like oh no I don't really feel like it it's nice and warm here why don't we sleep does spring like the others spring is still a long way off guess you're right it is nice and warm in here oh damn it's delicious chocolate cakes my favorite yes I did you say something snorkemen I'm so very hungry movement your mother's raspberry juice is really the best it is isn't it everybody said that last winter too he moment yeah I have a funny feeling someone is watching us and I don't like it one little bit moment poppacate explain it I'm sure of course someone's watching what but who and how do you know to take you told me all about it last winter snort maiden she doesn't hibernate you know she lives in our bathhouse and watches over us in the winter she said that many things are too shy to show themselves oh have you seen them yourself short of except they were invisible of course like under the sink or in the clock maybe in the empty fireplace and other dark corners of the room I can feel it did you actually look anywhere for them oh no they'd be very upset it's better not to let them know we know where they are I wonder what these things look like some of them look very much like us two tiki said old ancestors of ours from way back she thinks some of them look like as she said well I've never seen them for myself I wonder if there is good looking as we are wouldn't it be a good idea to stay up and wait for the sunrise a great idea now don't say anything to scare them but this is one of the movement's ancestors from way back is it morning already are you sure I think so there are no clouds so why can't we see the sun I guess maybe the sun doesn't come up at all this time of the year mom and I don't like this I don't like you one little bit you silly little girl what do you need this for please grandma I will be long I promise what are you talking about is if you could fly a broom get back back to me at once no I won't give it back now give me back bram and don't be silly how many times from I tell you you can't go visiting Moomin Valley but it's so boring here I want some company grandma come on bram fly off take me to Moomin Valley oh help me up grandma please all right my girl I'll help you up shall I I don't believe it I'm floating oh oh oh this is great wait oh I'm falling oh oh how about that of these I'll find the bird around here oh to bury things a bit how about this oh no stop the bram grandma oh you wanted to ride on the brum didn't you first so look like well oh oh oh oh if you want to learn to fly on this bram Alicia then forget all about those dreaded movements and really start studying it's hard work you know young woman you let's learn concentrate hey you up there are you making fun of me too oh I can't climb down there of course you can even if you fall you can't hurt yourself on this soft snow don't shake the ladder Moomin this is scary slowly does it take it easy as you can don't look down maybe going out wasn't such a good idea after all we can always change our mind to go back to sleep you know see you've made it it's very cold out here Moomin but I'd rather like it this is the roof over the front door isn't it yes and everything will be snowed up now to spring oh no what's happened to our firewood what's the matter there's not much wood left in here someone else must be burning it yes but who and for what I wonder I can feel it we're not alone in this forest I'm sure someone's watching us all those winter creatures no I don't think it's them the grog goodness me look how big she gets in the winter time Moomin I'm scared it'll be all right grog stop right there don't come any closer if you please you're much much too cold for us you see you could freeze a stiff you know oh is it possible that you get lonely all by yourself I don't think there's anything we can do to help you know not without fur coats and earmuffs and more gloves anyway we must go someone's been stealing our firewood I wonder what they're doing with it something bad there's no doubt about that must have been several people did this we had a lot of fun here in the summer remember well the she is still here round of the ice I hope too ticky too ticky there's no one here are you sure look for yourself I know they're invisible but I'm a shrewmice in here hard to tell with things you can't see oh what is it it felt like something scampering on my back that's all right it must be one of the shrewmice oh my god my goodness I've never seen anything quite like this before hi it's good to see you you're right she's fishing hi to ticky hello to ticky so this winter's not meant to walk up to huh uh uh I walk her up by mistake you know that spring is still a long way off don't you I thought it might be seeing there's no sun at all but the sun is going to come back tomorrow woman tomorrow snorkemaiden was so worried about the sun not showing the sun will rise tomorrow woman but it'll go down very soon to ticky you know I think there must be records in moving valley records in winter there's an enormous pile of firewood up on the hillside I know it took a long time to collect that wood but some of it belongs to us that doesn't really surprise me though woman I'm afraid the winner creatures unfair careful about ownership they need a lot so if they see it they take it it's for their big winner bonfire a bonfire yes and now your firewood can take part in the big celebration they light it every winter to make sure the sun comes back you know oh you mean otherwise the sun wouldn't come back to ticky well since they always light it on this day you don't really know do you tonight you might see the winner creatures okay we come along as well to ticky yes you can if you sit quietly and don't scare them in any way wonderful you're coming along too aren't you it of course stop happy someone shouting for help who could it be go away get away from me I didn't do it on purpose I didn't mean any harm if you don't leave me alone grandma will turn you into a towed oh it's so cold go away please oh grow leave her alone what are you doing Grog movement Alicia now listen Grog why can't you be nice to her Alicia's one of my friends she was just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis I nearly bumped into her but I didn't touch her that's all right Alicia tell me Grog what's gotten into you why you so nasty to such a sweet little girl it isn't like you at all I must have startled her I guess and I did apologize and all but it made no difference this is really very odd then I asked if she had seen you and that's when she started to get mad at me but she doesn't even know me it's a mystery whatever's the matter with you Grog oh it was so scared I'm so glad you've come to see us so am I moment somehow I felt certain you hadn't gone into hibernation yet but what did your grandmother say nothing because I didn't tell her I was coming thank you for chasing off that terrible monster the Grog hasn't actually ever attacked anyone well maybe she doesn't like the look of Alicia snork maiden oh it's really a mystery to me why the Grog was here at all she was here looking for a moment no doubt was she he suddenly become very popular you don't mean what's the matter with you I think the Grog may have fallen in love with you movement what oh you can't mean that please tell me you're not serious it's out of the question it's a ridiculous idea don't be so silly oh where's all that drumming noise coming from from the invisible shroom ice how long before everybody oh they're here already movement all around us they are where I can't see them are they really invisible I can't see them either but I can feel their presence all around me but she's been studying witchcraft hasn't she I'm sure you and movement will be able to feel their presence quite soon oh I can see some of them look they're over there I see them too you guys do you think you tell me why can't we see all of them well we can never see them all I don't understand how did you know earlier on the shroom ice were playing the drums I just know because they sometimes play them in the batch house as well what a wonderful celebration isn't it lucky I came over here if I had not had missed a most memorable evening what's going on here the grog what what's she doing she must be looking for movement again I guess no I think she just wants to warm this up by the fire what's she doing oh that's the end of the midwinter bonfire pull grog she freezes everything she touches whatever she sits on even the hottest bonfire turns freezing cold in a matter of seconds well at least she's managed to save some of our wood oh hold on tight now snorke made in and be careful I can't wait to get into bed I wanted to stay up until the sun came up again but I don't know if I could keep awake till then so long till spring man room man goodbye and take care Alicia I will move in the moon will light my way back this time the movements of God too far something must be done I'll teach them a lesson they'll never forget they won't get the better at me now what does the witch mean by teach them a lesson that sounds very ominous let's hope at least that she lets them sleep till next spring they love the laughter and they love the living the movements we're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements they're always happy and goes at play the moments are having fun day after day the moments the moments, the moments The Moons",
