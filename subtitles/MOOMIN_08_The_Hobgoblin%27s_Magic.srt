5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:58,240
there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments

6
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:28,240
there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments

7
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:40,240
there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments

8
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:52,240
there you are

9
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:02,240
oops

10
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:12,240
we weren't looking where we were going that's all right thank you think of me are you going out

11
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:20,240
yes for a walk we'll have fun

12
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,240
it seems that thingamy and bob are well and truly part of movement house now

13
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,960
luckily they don't eat a lot and are small enough to find the pencils that fall

14
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:38,240
between the floorboards in the porch

15
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,240
hey this looks like a great hiding place nobody would ever find it here

16
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,800
come on bob let's go get the suitcase man are you sure it's not safe for an

17
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,800
arm what would you say someone went in when we went there you wouldn't like it would

18
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,800
you I think the movements are much too nice to do anything like that it's not

19
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,800
them it's the guess I'm thinking about you know the movements let anybody stay

20
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:16,800
snorke maiden you lied to me little my homie

21
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,800
moment still has the shell that I gave him but you said that he didn't impossible

22
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,800
movement mama gave it to the grove I was there when she did it look I saw it he showed it to me

23
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,800
are you really sure was it the same one of course it was I'm not stupid you know

24
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,800
that's very odd I saw her do it with my own eyes well I'll go and ask moving right now

25
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,800
little my it's a bit awkward but if I'm going to be honest snorke maiden what well

26
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,800
I've decided that from now on I'm only going to tell the truth oh yes and I found

27
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,800
something you might be interested in what is it mumble and I were down on the beach

28
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,800
yesterday and you remember all those things we found washed up by the storm do you

29
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,800
mean on the hatty fatter's island that we sailed to yes and do you remember the

30
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,800
figurehead that movement like best of all you know the lady made of wood and

31
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,800
painted she was really lovely wasn't she yes I remember movement wanted to keep it

32
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,800
so what about it well it's here on the beach it was still the same as beautiful

33
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,800
as ever we said the same one yes I remember her pretty face don't legs though

34
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,800
she's just a silly wooden doll oh I know that but she's got those gorgeous eyes and

35
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,800
lovely long hair little my why all this fuss about this silly figurehead

36
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,800
trust him only someone as stupid as movement could fall in love with a figurehead

37
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,800
it's probably still dreaming about her every night do you think it's still there

38
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Jars snorke maiden if no one else has found her already do you think the ocean

39
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,800
might come and wash her away again why all these silly questions snorke maiden

40
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,800
woman would go and rescue her if he knew so that would be terrible I couldn't

41
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,800
bear it at all I really couldn't how pathetic he'll probably take her home

42
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,800
and keep her in his room forever my expect she's too big to go through the door

43
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,800
he'll just sit and stare at her with that lovesick look on his face I know he will

44
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,800
oh where are you going now I thought you were going to move in house I was but

45
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
there's something more important I have to do

46
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,800
okay it's clear

47
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,800
hey you two you're not leaving are you no we're just uh we're going

48
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,800
why have you got the suitcase them look woman would you help us with something

49
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:05,800
of course thank you very much woman oh that's okay it's a bit too big for you to

50
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,800
carry we can take it from here it's all right it's not very heavy

51
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,800
oh silly me it wouldn't be a very secret place if I'd seen it would it I'll see you

52
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,800
later don't be too long now of course I won't

53
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,800
hey what are you doing up there little my I'm coming down what does it look like

54
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,800
you're much too small to do that the rungs are too far apart for you to reach

55
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,800
just you watch me

56
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,360
movement I have a problem do you mind if I ask you something go ahead did

57
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:12,040
movement mama give snorke means heart shape shell to the grove yes she did so

58
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:18,040
you and the grove can't both have it can you that's just where you're wrong but

59
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:25,040
that's simply impossible you can't have the grove simply got another one that's not true

60
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,040
all right but it would only upset snorke made an if she knew so I'm not going to

61
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,040
tell her you rotten thing why don't you just tell me the truth because it's a

62
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,040
secret but I want to know movement look movement now why don't you tell me your

63
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:48,040
secret and then I'll tell you mine what is it really very top secret go on then tell me

64
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:55,040
tell me yours first no you tell me first I know let's say them together all right

65
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:02,040
ready one two three after we go and I went to the beach yesterday I'm out there we'll

66
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:09,040
make you like it what did you say the figure head by the

67
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:16,040
K wait a minute you didn't finish telling me your secret I'll tell you later that's

68
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:23,040
not there you've got to tell me now

69
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:48,040
what do you think moments to let I don't know maybe he's looking for shells again

70
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:58,040
I don't think so he looks a bit worried to me maybe he's lost something important

71
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:05,040
how much further do we have to go as far as you can road where a long way out

72
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,040
already I know I want to make sure that the lady will never turn up again we must go

73
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:17,040
further out we must be far enough by now I'm tired no the currents could still drag her

74
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,040
in from here keep going

75
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:35,040
he looks very unhappy we've got to cheer him up but how is only one way Bob yet you're

76
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,040
right thing to me

77
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:54,040
hello look so sad moment that we thought we try make you happy again

78
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:02,040
you don't mind do you know but you don't have to I'm all right really

79
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,040
how about this then moment we're going to show you what's in our suitcase

80
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:15,040
would you like that moment it's very interesting oh my gosh will you

81
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:26,040
do you need some help in there no I think we can manage

82
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:44,040
now we'll open it yes now one two three oh gosh by my tail

83
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:51,040
do you like it oh boy do I like it then you're not sad anymore then oh no

84
00:10:51,040 --> 00:11:04,040
that's good isn't it it was such a beautiful ruby how it changed color from soft red

85
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,040
to sapphire blue and then to pink one minute it was like a flame leaping out of the

86
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,040
center then suddenly it was like a blood tulip it was perhaps that's the king's

87
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:21,040
ruby it was just beautiful that's the one the hob goblin the searching for oh

88
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,040
no however far away is he'll come back on his black panther looking for it and he's

89
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,040
sure to find it because he'll know that thing of me and Bob have it first the

90
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:41,040
groke and allow the hob goblin what are we going to do no more than a week

91
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:54,040
later and like a bolt from the blue a real catastrophe hit mumen valley no it's not

92
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,880
