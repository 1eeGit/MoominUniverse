00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:46.000 --> 00:58.000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-a!

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
Have you ever heard of Moon and Valley?

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
Deep white snow covers the whole valley, and everyone goes to sleep so that they keep warm.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Look, there's a woman house.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
There's a woman, our hero.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
A woman, a woman, a woman.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
A woman, a woman.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
A woman, a woman.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
And this little bundle must be little my.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
I think before our story starts, we better wake everyone up with some spring sunshine.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Oh!

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
At last! It's spring!

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Wake up, everyone! It's spring time!

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
A woman, a woman.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
A woman.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Oh, little my, you're up.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
It's hard to stay asleep with you yelling.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I can't help it if I'm happy.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
So yeah, woke me.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
I was having a lovely dream about living in a watermelon.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
But it's beautiful outside.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Oh, gee, isn't. Is it really, woman?

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Yes, it's all fresh. The flowers are out and the sun is shining.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
So, I like being asleep.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
But it's spring. You said you wanted me to wake you as soon as spring was here.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Oh, boy, did I?

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Yes, you did, little my. You said you wanted to be a welcome as soon as spring was here.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Really? Yes, you did.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Did I say something like that?

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
You can go back to bed if you want to. Nobody's making you get up, little my.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
No, there's really no point, movement. I'm not sleepy anymore.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Well, there you are then.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Mama!

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Good spring, movement.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Movement, mama. I'm starving. Have you got any watermelon?

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
No, but there's lots of other things.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
We'll all have a nice big breakfast.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
I can hear a snuffkin.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Good spring.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Wouldn't it be quicker to use the stairs?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
More fun this way.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Are you going home now?

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
Yes, thanks very much for letting me spend the winter here.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
Don't think your sister will be back yet, though. I'll go anyway.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Snuffkin!

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Oh, hello, movement.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
It's really good to see you, snuffkin.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
And you too?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
You're back, Arley.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Aren't you having a good time?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Yes, I was.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
But I didn't want to miss spring time in movement valley.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
What did you do?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
I'll tell you later.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Let's go wake up, Snuff, and think of something exciting to do.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
I don't think I'll like it.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
He's still snoring, movement. I'll do it again.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Well, that's done it.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Come on, Snuff, it's spring. Snuffkin's here.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Please go away, you two.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
We're going to do something really exciting.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Like what, moment?

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
I can think of more exciting things to do than this.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Well, let's imagine that we're the first ever to climb this mountain.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
It's such a clear day.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
We'll be able to see all of movement valley when we get to the top and the sea.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Good morning, Mr. Emulance.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Morning, moment.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Are your father and mother up?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Yes.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Mama was when I came out.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Good.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
I'll never understand how you can sleep for months on end.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
We like it.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Oh, yes.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Why do they always have to do something exciting?

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
What a gorgeous view.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
It really is.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
Hey, look, they're smoke coming from moment house.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
We should have stayed at home.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
The moment Mama's cooking something good.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Look.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
What is it?

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
We're not the first here after all.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Look over there.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
A top hat.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Hmm, a rather large one.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
I wonder who's how it is.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
I don't know, but I know papa would like it.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Hmm, it's much too big.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Oh dear, what's that?

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
I can really get inside it.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
You see, I cover it for my old one.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Oh, I can't moment it.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Stop, moment.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
No, that's enough nonsense as it can't take it off now.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Oh, damn.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
What's the matter?

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
I can't move it. It's stuck, moment.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I'll give you a hand.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
It's harder.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Oh, that's better.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Thank you.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
What's all this noise?

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Papa's head got stuck in the hat, Mama.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Oh, yes, and where did that come from?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Oh, moment, Mama.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
The children found it when they were out and brought it back for me.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
It's very smart.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
What shall we do with it, Papa?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
There is something strange about it.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Shall I throw it away then?

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Oh, no. It's too good for that.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Do we know anyone with a very big head?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
No, moment, Papa.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I know what we can do with it.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
It's a...

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
A waste paper basket, Mooma Mama.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
That's right.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Well done, Snuffkin.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
That was easy.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Come on, Snuffkin.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Come and have some breakfast with us.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Hmm, beautiful.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Yes.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Sorry to disturb you, but I'm going to see Moomin.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Uh-huh.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Do you want to come with me, Snork?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Uh-huh.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Or would you rather stay here?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Uh-huh.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Well, are you coming or not?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Uh-huh.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Not coming, man?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Uh-huh.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Snork?

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
Well, you know my flying ship is almost finished.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
It'll be ready this year.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
You'll see.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
This is an historic moment.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Oh, dear.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Perhaps it needs a little more work.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
I wonder if you really can make a flying ship.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
Don't be silly, of course you can't.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
A little, my Snorks always dreamed about doing it.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Dreams were all right.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Yes, as long as they're not impossible.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I don't know.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Yes, as long as they're not impossible.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I suppose so.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Hmm.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Sniff, you're not still feeding your face, are you?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Do you ever dream, Sniff?

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
Only nightmares about having no food at all, little my.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Hmm.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
I wonder who dropped this.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Where can I put it?

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Oh, there you are.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Just a thing.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Wow.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Golly, what are they?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
They're clouds.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Be careful.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Don't touch it.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
It might be poisonous.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
It feels like cotton.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Well, ee.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
This is great.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
I'm floating.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Wonderful.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Oh.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Can I try it?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yes.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Wow.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Golly, what are they?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
They're clouds.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Be careful.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Don't touch it.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
It might be poisonous.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
It feels like cotton.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Well, ee.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
This is great.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Can I try it?

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Are you ready, Snork Maiden?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Here we go.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Yeah.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
What have you got to hide?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
My phone.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Wait for me.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Hey.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
There's a wait for me.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Whoa.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Whoa.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Whoa.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Hey, wait for me.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Let me get on.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Whoa.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Whoa.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Help!

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I'm falling.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
Mumen Papa is in his study trying to write his memoirs.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
A lot has happened to him over the years.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
An awful lot.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
And he's trying to remember it.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
What was that?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Mumen.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Hi, Papa.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
What are you doing out there?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
We're flying.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
The clouds just came out of the house.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Try and get mirrors so I can reach you.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Oh.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
No, I'm alright.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Why don't you come for a ride?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Stop.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Wait a minute.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
It's great.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
You feel like a bird.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Mumen.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Oh.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Come on, Papa.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Jump or you'll fall.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
I hate it.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
It's alright.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Oh.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Whoa.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Mumen Mama quickly.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
What's the matter?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Have you seen what the children are doing?

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Yes.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Look at them.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
They're flying about on clouds.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
It can't be safe.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Don't worry, Papa.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
It's alright.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
I told them to be careful.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Come on, Snappy.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Come on.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
I won.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
I won.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
I won.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Whoa.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Hey, wait a minute.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Little cloud.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Wait for me.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Don't go away.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Oh.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Oh, I got you.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
That is three cotton.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I'm going to climb right up here.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
And I'm going to get you right there.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Come on.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Come on, little cloud.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
I'm going to take you with me.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Hey, come on.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
You just keep coming back.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Yeah.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
I'm going to take you.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Yeah.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
I got you now.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
You are going to get away from me.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Here I go.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Come on.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
All of that ledge.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Come on.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
I want you to play.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Oh.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Oh.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Oh.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Oh.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Oh.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Oh.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Oh.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Oh, boy.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
What's happening?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
My cloud's starting to go.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Oh.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Whoa.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
That was fun.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Yeah, it was, but I wasn't ready to stop.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Look.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
There's movement in snorkemaiden.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Hey.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Hey.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Why have they still got cloud snuffed in?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
There's a starting to go as well.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I think they'd better get off.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Hey.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Right.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
I'll start counting.

15:40.000 --> 15:46.000
One, two, three.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
Do you want something little mind?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Yes.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
A place to hide.

15:51.000 --> 16:01.000
Five, six, seven.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
Boy, I don't think there's any place to hide.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
And here is there.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
No.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Oh.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
It's too dirty in there.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I know.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I'll hide in the head.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Ooh.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Ooh.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Ooh.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Ooh.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
One, two, one, two, one.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Hey.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Huh?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Huh?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Huh?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Huh?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Huh?

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Huh?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Huh?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Huh?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Huh?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Huh?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Huh?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Huh?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Huh?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Huh?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Huh?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Huh?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Huh?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Huh?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Huh?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Huh?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Huh?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Huh.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Huh.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Huh?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Huh?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Uh-huh.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Gotcha.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Huh?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Huh?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Huh?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Slork made.

17:03.000 --> 17:30.480
Well, last time I saw him, he was hiding in the fireplace.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.280
Have you found him yet?

17:32.280 --> 17:33.880
Have you looked in the cellar?

17:33.880 --> 17:35.080
Yes, I have.

17:35.080 --> 17:39.720
Wait a minute, did you hear someone laughing?

17:39.720 --> 17:41.560
Where'd it come from?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.760
G.I. better go home.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.760
Oh, is there anything wrong?

17:45.760 --> 17:48.800
Yes, I can't find moment anywhere.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.200
Well, he's too fat to be most places.

17:51.200 --> 17:58.200
To come in from under the hat.

17:58.200 --> 18:05.040
Well, here I am, sniff.

18:05.040 --> 18:08.240
Oh, on earth are you.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.480
I one land didn't I.

18:11.480 --> 18:15.080
You looked everywhere in the house, and you couldn't find me, couldn't you?

18:15.080 --> 18:16.080
So I won.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.280
Who would want to find you anyway?

18:18.920 --> 18:21.720
Well, you were trying hard enough, weren't you?

18:21.720 --> 18:23.920
What is this in your game?

18:23.920 --> 18:25.920
My name's Snork Maiden.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.200
What's yours?

18:27.200 --> 18:31.200
I'm the King of Moomin Valley, my pretty one.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.160
You're too ugly to be the King of anything.

18:34.160 --> 18:38.120
Well, now, that's not a very nice thing to say to your friend.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.320
Is it Papa?

18:39.320 --> 18:43.080
Now, you'd better tell me what you have done with Moomin.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.360
But I'm here.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.560
Where?

18:45.560 --> 18:46.640
Right here.

18:46.640 --> 18:54.040
Who are you, and where is Moomin?

18:54.040 --> 18:55.040
Papa.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.080
I'm certainly not your Papa.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.080
Yes, you are.

18:58.080 --> 18:58.760
Come on.

18:58.760 --> 18:59.720
I'm Moomin.

18:59.720 --> 19:03.120
I don't know who you are, but you're not Moomin.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.880
He's nice and handsome and nothing like you.

19:05.880 --> 19:10.160
Have you looked at yourself in a mirror?

19:10.160 --> 19:11.880
But where's my nose gone?

19:11.880 --> 19:14.720
Oh, there's nothing there anymore.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.920
Oh, no, my tail's all pushy.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.080
Oh, no!

19:19.080 --> 19:19.920
Oh!

19:24.320 --> 19:27.320
Here!

19:27.320 --> 19:29.320
This is terrible!

19:29.320 --> 19:30.320
Oh!

19:35.520 --> 19:36.920
Who are you?

19:36.920 --> 19:38.720
What have you done with me?

19:38.720 --> 19:40.920
It must be a nightmare!

19:40.920 --> 19:43.320
I want to come back.

19:43.520 --> 19:46.520
Go away, you're horrible.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.840
Dear me, what's all this noise?

19:49.840 --> 19:52.520
What's happened?

19:52.520 --> 19:53.840
Mama!

19:53.840 --> 19:54.680
Mama!

19:54.680 --> 19:56.160
Mama!

19:56.160 --> 19:57.720
What earth is this?

19:57.720 --> 20:01.080
He says he's Moomin, but just look at him.

20:01.080 --> 20:04.120
You don't look like I'm Moomin.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.680
I am, I am.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.600
Please believe me, Mama.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.080
I am Moomin.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.720
Well, I don't know.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.120
I'm sure.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.280
Something's happened to me.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.080
Why do I look so different?

20:16.080 --> 20:17.920
Now then calm down.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.480
This won't help at all.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.200
We don't need all this noise.

20:21.200 --> 20:25.080
If you really are Moomin, then everything will be all right.

20:25.080 --> 20:28.200
Just give me a minute or two and I'll know.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.480
Mama, call me Moomin, please.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.560
I don't know what's happened, but I am me.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.960
Honestly, I am.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.600
Mama, please believe me.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.000
I am Moomin.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.320
Let me see.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.480
Oh, Mama, you do know it's me.

20:41.520 --> 20:44.400
You must, you can't forget your little Moomin,

20:44.400 --> 20:46.640
please, Mama, please, Mama.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.680
Oh, hush now, hush now.

20:57.760 --> 20:58.680
Mama!

20:58.680 --> 20:59.680
Shh!

21:03.280 --> 21:07.480
Yes, you're my little Moomin, all right.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.000
Oh, Mama!

21:09.320 --> 21:10.480
Ah!

21:10.480 --> 21:11.760
Ah!

21:20.760 --> 21:21.760
Oh!

21:25.960 --> 21:27.960
A Moomin!

21:28.960 --> 21:29.960
Papa?

21:29.960 --> 21:32.160
A Moomin, my boy.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.160
Where were you hiding?

21:34.160 --> 21:36.160
In there.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.160
In the hat?

21:39.440 --> 21:42.440
Let's hope it's the last we'll see of it.

21:44.440 --> 21:48.080
Moomin, Papa, decided that although it was a fine hat,

21:48.080 --> 21:50.440
it was too dangerous to keep.

21:50.440 --> 21:54.240
So Moomin threw it in the river and it floated away.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.240
He wasn't too sure about it, though,

21:56.240 --> 21:59.240
because it was a rather special hat.

22:01.240 --> 22:05.240
They love the laughter and they love the laughter.

22:06.240 --> 22:13.240
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.

22:13.240 --> 22:21.240
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

22:21.240 --> 22:25.240
They're always happy and always at play.

22:25.240 --> 22:32.240
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

22:32.240 --> 22:42.240
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.

22:42.240 --> 22:50.240
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

22:50.240 --> 22:54.240
They're always happy and always at play.

22:54.240 --> 23:01.240
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

23:01.240 --> 23:05.240
The Moomin's.

23:05.240 --> 23:11.240
The Moomin's.

23:11.240 --> 23:21.240
The Moomin's.

23:21.240 --> 23:29.240
The Moomin's.

23:29.240 --> 23:33.240
Here they are for one and all.

23:33.240 --> 23:36.240
The Moomin's are about to call.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.240
Come on and sit down here with me.

23:39.240 --> 23:41.240
They're here for you on your TV.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.240
They are the Moomin's.

23:44.240 --> 23:47.240
They are the Moomin's.

23:47.240 --> 23:50.240
So come with me, give me your hand.

23:50.240 --> 23:53.240
I'll take you up to Moomin land.

23:53.240 --> 23:56.240
You can fly just like a bird.

23:56.240 --> 23:58.240
Sing that song ever.

23:58.240 --> 24:01.240
There were the Moomin's.

24:01.240 --> 24:04.240
There were the Moomin's.

24:04.240 --> 24:14.240
There were the Moomin's.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.240
There were the Moomin's.

24:16.240 --> 24:46.240
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

25:16.240 --> 25:20.240
Mumin loves to spend as much time as he can with his friend, Snuffkin.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.240
Snuffkin?

25:24.240 --> 25:25.240
Snuffkin?

25:25.240 --> 25:27.240
Where are you?

25:27.240 --> 25:30.240
He must have forgotten I was coming and gone off somewhere.

25:31.240 --> 25:33.240
How can he enjoy being here on his own?

25:33.240 --> 25:36.240
I'd like to be alone now and then you know.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.240
Oh, silly. Let's go and explore.

25:38.240 --> 25:41.240
Let's leave it till tomorrow, Snark Maiden.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.240
But we said we'd go today.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.240
Yeah, we did too, Mumin.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.240
You are the one that said it, you know.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.240
Hmm, you did. I didn't.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.240
You did too.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.240
Oh, you must come.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.240
We're going to collect shells on the beach.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.240
Come on. It'll be fun.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.240
Oh, no.

26:01.240 --> 26:02.240
Hey!

26:02.240 --> 26:03.240
It's Snuff.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.240
Where are you guys going?

26:05.240 --> 26:08.240
Oh, I envy Snuffkin.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.240
Oh, why?

26:09.240 --> 26:10.240
I just do.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.240
I wonder where Snuffkin has gone.

26:19.240 --> 26:23.240
I wonder if we'll ever find anything as exciting as the hat.

26:23.240 --> 26:26.240
Yeah, it was very special that hat.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.240
Did you really throw it in the river?

26:28.240 --> 26:29.240
Yeah.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.240
I wish you hadn't.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.240
It was much too dangerous to keep.

26:32.240 --> 26:35.240
Look at the horrible things it did to me.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.240
But what about the eggshells it turned into clouds?

26:37.240 --> 26:40.240
Yeah, it was good fun flying around.

26:40.240 --> 26:44.240
Perhaps I'll find an oyster with a huge pearl inside.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.240
Snuffkin.

27:07.240 --> 27:08.240
Moment.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.240
Moment.

27:09.240 --> 27:10.240
Moment.

27:10.240 --> 27:11.240
Moment.

27:11.240 --> 27:12.240
Wake up.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.240
Snork made me tell.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.240
What?

27:14.240 --> 27:15.240
What's happened?

27:15.240 --> 27:18.240
We were playing tag and she fell into an ant lion hole.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.240
We've got to get her out quickly.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.240
Come on, moving.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.240
Nearly there, Snork Maiden.

27:23.240 --> 27:24.240
Just a bit further.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.240
Help me, Snuff.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.240
Give me your hand.

27:26.240 --> 27:27.240
Hurry.

27:29.240 --> 27:30.240
Look out.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.240
It's the ant lion.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.240
Look what you're doing to my hole.

27:34.240 --> 27:35.240
I'm sorry.

27:35.240 --> 27:37.240
I'll be out soon.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.240
Stop yelling and kicking like that.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.240
You're scaring off my prey.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.240
Are you all right, Snork Maiden?

27:46.240 --> 27:48.240
I can't reach her.

27:48.240 --> 27:51.240
I don't have to have ants for lunch, you know.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.240
Don't be a woman, please.

27:53.240 --> 27:55.240
You better get in there, Sniff.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.240
What?

27:56.240 --> 27:57.240
Me?

27:57.240 --> 27:58.240
Don't worry.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.240
I'll hold on to you.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.240
You're the only one tall enough, Sniff.

28:01.240 --> 28:02.240
Come on.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.240
You look nice and tasty.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.240
I'll eat you and Sniff.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.240
You look nice and tasty.

28:06.240 --> 28:07.240
I'll eat you and Sniff.

28:07.240 --> 28:08.240
Good Sniff.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.240
Look, hi.

28:09.240 --> 28:10.240
Get in there.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.240
You're big.

28:11.240 --> 28:13.240
Where you from?

28:13.240 --> 28:14.400
You thought you called me a bigWhen.

28:14.400 --> 28:15.240
Woah!

28:15.240 --> 28:17.240
You gotta grab.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.240
Scoughter Right now.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.240
Snork Me.

28:26.240 --> 28:28.240
Thank you.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.240
Thank you.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.240
Right.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.240
Are you ready?

28:31.240 --> 28:32.240
Hold tight.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.240
Come on, nearly a bit.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.240
Ah!

28:38.240 --> 28:40.240
Ah!

28:40.240 --> 28:42.240
Come on, nearly a bit.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.240
Ah!

28:46.240 --> 28:48.240
Ah!

28:48.240 --> 28:50.240
Ah!

29:02.240 --> 29:04.240
Where have you been, self-kin?

29:04.240 --> 29:06.240
That's a big, secret movement.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.240
I won't tell anyone.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.240
All right. It's the magic hat.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.240
It's on a sandbank further down the river.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.240
Gosh!

29:14.240 --> 29:16.240
But something terrible is happening.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.240
What? What is it?

29:22.240 --> 29:26.240
Oh dear, perhaps we shouldn't have thrown it in the river.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.240
It's too late now.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.240
Let's go.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.240
It's too late now.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.240
Let's get there, cooking.

29:44.240 --> 29:48.240
There it is. It's caught on a branch in the middle.

29:48.240 --> 29:52.240
Where? Oh, Smovkin, I can see it.

29:52.240 --> 29:54.240
Look at the water. It's all red.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.240
Hmm. Seems to be coming from the hat.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.240
I wonder what it is, move.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.240
I won't get it.

29:59.240 --> 30:01.240
Be careful.

30:01.240 --> 30:03.240
Shall I come too?

30:03.240 --> 30:05.240
No, you stay there.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.240
Have you got it?

30:13.240 --> 30:15.240
Uh-huh.

30:29.240 --> 30:31.240
Wow! It's raspberry juice.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.240
What should we do with the hat?

30:33.240 --> 30:35.240
Well, I don't think it's a good idea to leave it lying around.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.240
Somebody might crawl into it.

30:37.240 --> 30:41.240
But if we put water in it, we can have as much raspberry juice as we can drink.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.240
Well, that would be nice.

30:43.240 --> 30:45.240
But you know, movement.

30:45.240 --> 30:47.240
It could only be river water that does that.

30:47.240 --> 30:49.240
You know what I mean, movement?

30:49.240 --> 30:51.240
Well, I think it's worth experimenting.

30:51.240 --> 31:00.240
...

31:14.240 --> 31:17.240
What's the matter, moving? You look very tired.

31:17.240 --> 31:20.240
I woke up in the night and couldn't get back to sleep.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.240
Ha, pardon?

31:22.240 --> 31:23.240
Couldn't get back to sleep.

31:23.240 --> 31:26.240
Ha, what are you talking about?

31:26.240 --> 31:30.240
I was awake last night too.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.240
And I know why you're so tired.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.240
You must have been dreaming.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.240
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

31:36.240 --> 31:39.240
Thanks, mama.

31:39.240 --> 31:41.240
Where are you going, Moomin?

31:41.240 --> 31:42.240
Moomin!

31:42.240 --> 31:44.240
Somewhere you can't come.

31:44.240 --> 31:46.240
Somewhere private.

31:46.240 --> 31:49.240
So, what was that all about, huh?

31:49.240 --> 31:52.240
Oh, nothing really important, Moomin, Papa.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.240
I think I'll go out.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.240
Ha, ha.

32:05.240 --> 32:08.240
Nobody hides anything from little, my.

32:08.240 --> 32:10.240
Snopkin!

32:14.240 --> 32:15.240
Hey, I found out who's had it is.

32:15.240 --> 32:17.240
Who's?

32:17.240 --> 32:18.240
The Hobgoblins.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.240
The Hobgoblins.

32:19.240 --> 32:30.240
Yeah, I asked the Hemmielin and he told me that he saw him once, long ago wearing that.

32:30.240 --> 32:33.240
I heard about the wizard who flies in the sky.

32:33.240 --> 32:35.240
Yeah, on the back of a black panther.

32:35.240 --> 32:39.240
The Hobgoblins is hundreds of years old and cares only for rubies.

32:39.240 --> 32:42.240
He rides all over the world, searching for them.

32:42.240 --> 32:44.240
He's truly awesome.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.240
And so, when he dropped his hat?

32:49.240 --> 32:53.240
He must have been looking for some rubies right here in Moomin Valley.

32:53.240 --> 32:56.240
Do you think he's got a lot of hats, Snopkin?

32:56.240 --> 32:57.240
Gee, I don't know.

32:57.240 --> 33:01.240
Well, do you think perhaps he doesn't know where he dropped his hat?

33:01.240 --> 33:04.240
Yeah, I suppose that's possible.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.240
Snopkin!

33:05.240 --> 33:08.240
There's something I would like to try with the hat.

33:08.240 --> 33:09.240
Just don't put it on.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.240
Will you?

33:15.240 --> 33:16.240
He's in there somewhere.

33:16.240 --> 33:19.240
Hat lions are pretty stupid, you know.

33:19.240 --> 33:24.240
Yes, Moomin Papa told me it takes him hours to dig themselves into the sand.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.240
Oh, no, it doesn't.

33:25.240 --> 33:26.240
It only takes him one hour.

33:26.240 --> 33:27.240
Only an hour?

33:27.240 --> 33:28.240
You're kidding.

33:28.240 --> 33:32.240
Well, of course, an hour is a long time to spend, digging.

33:32.240 --> 33:35.240
Are you talking about me?

33:35.240 --> 33:39.240
Yes, about how quickly you could dig yourself into a hole in the sand.

33:39.240 --> 33:42.240
A lot quicker than you think it'll take.

33:42.240 --> 33:46.240
Moomin here says it takes you only one hour to dig a hole in the sand.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.240
But I can't believe that.

33:49.240 --> 33:53.240
Snopkin says it takes several hours, but I think he's wrong.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.240
I'll show you how long.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.240
Gosh, that was rather fast.

33:59.240 --> 34:03.240
Yeah, but it's obvious he's already got a ready-made hole hidden there.

34:03.240 --> 34:04.240
Don't you ant lion.

34:06.240 --> 34:07.240
No, I do not.

34:09.240 --> 34:12.240
I can dig myself in anywhere, anywhere at all.

34:19.240 --> 34:20.240
How about here?

34:20.240 --> 34:21.240
Yeah, okay.

34:21.240 --> 34:22.240
Under this rock.

34:22.240 --> 34:23.240
All right?

34:23.240 --> 34:24.240
Anywhere.

34:24.240 --> 34:25.240
Just show me.

34:25.240 --> 34:27.240
Okay, start from here.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.240
Yeah, just there if you don't mind.

34:30.240 --> 34:32.240
All right, start counting.

34:37.240 --> 34:40.240
Wow, you only took a second and a half.

34:40.240 --> 34:42.240
He's really something, isn't he?

34:42.240 --> 34:43.240
He certainly is.

34:43.240 --> 34:45.240
I'd better sit on it.

34:45.240 --> 34:47.240
Yeah, he'll be a really mad.

34:59.240 --> 35:01.240
So you've caught the ant lion.

35:01.240 --> 35:02.240
I've been watching.

35:02.240 --> 35:03.240
Little boy.

35:03.240 --> 35:04.240
Right.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.240
Did you follow us last night?

35:06.240 --> 35:07.240
Yes.

35:07.240 --> 35:09.240
Oh, did you tell the others?

35:09.240 --> 35:11.240
Oh, don't be silly you guys.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.240
I haven't said a word yet.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.240
But you will if we don't let you join in with us.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.240
That's what she's doing, movement.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.240
No, as if I do such a thing.

35:19.240 --> 35:22.240
Of course, I'm forgetting how nice and kind you are.

35:24.240 --> 35:25.240
Hey.

35:26.240 --> 35:28.240
Hey, what is that?

35:37.240 --> 35:39.240
Nope, no hat anywhere.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.240
There's gallons of water.

35:47.240 --> 35:50.240
Gosh, there sure must be a lot of sand in there.

35:50.240 --> 35:54.240
He must have changed into something else by now.

35:54.240 --> 35:55.240
Probably.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.240
It must have been long enough.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.240
Oh, jump off.

36:01.240 --> 36:04.240
He isn't strong enough to move the rock by himself.

36:05.240 --> 36:06.240
Shall we help him?

36:06.240 --> 36:07.240
No, don't.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.240
Come on, let's do it.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.240
What's happened to him?

36:15.240 --> 36:17.240
Let's turn it over.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.240
Oh, no, I can't look.

36:24.240 --> 36:26.240
I'll give it a try.

36:29.240 --> 36:30.240
Oh.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.240
It's a hedgehog.

36:45.240 --> 36:47.240
It's a sword.

36:47.240 --> 36:48.240
It's a sword.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.240
Shoot.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.240

36:51.240 --> 36:53.240

43:53.960 --> 43:59.080
any uncommonly large rubies here would you you finding my hat here must be an omen

43:59.960 --> 44:11.400
here you are mr. hub goblin my husband moman papa gave it to me it is fine indeed and you are

44:11.400 --> 44:17.560
lucky to have it but I'm afraid it is not the king's ruby I am looking for what do you mean king's

44:17.560 --> 44:24.440
ruby I have searched for it for hundreds of years moman mama I'm afraid I am obsessed by it and cannot

45:09.400 --> 45:13.160
and so the hub goblin's hat finally disappeared from moman valley

45:14.200 --> 45:19.480
moman rather missed having an ever-ending supply of raspberry juice but his parents were more

45:19.480 --> 45:21.480

48:15.240 --> 48:21.240

the sun returned to the eastern sky when morning came and everything started to get lighter and loud

50:33.240 --> 50:39.240

50:39.240 --> 50:45.240
I have absolutely no literary talent I'm an ignoramus son a literate dilettant no

nice snuffkin hello moman didn't think you were coming sorry I'm late what's that

51:48.240 --> 51:54.240
a leaf boat look it sails on the river just like a real one

51:54.240 --> 52:00.240
I bet it goes all the way down to the sea and maybe even to some foreign lands

52:00.240 --> 52:04.240
gosh snuffkin I'd like to do that one day let's go then shall we

52:04.240 --> 52:10.240
little my wanted to come but I told you it was too dangerous

52:10.240 --> 52:16.240
hmm perhaps it wasn't the best thing to say look

52:16.240 --> 52:24.240
I thought they could use a bit of fun wait oh man

52:24.240 --> 52:32.240
are we really going to climb up there look I don't think we can all go it'll just be

52:32.240 --> 52:38.240
moving in me I'm not climbing up there well I am wouldn't you like to keep me

52:38.240 --> 52:42.240
company instead look there's a cave just a little bit further along this path

52:42.240 --> 52:46.240
why don't you two girls wait for a sec we won't be long

52:46.240 --> 52:50.240
but if you can walk to it why on earth climb to it

52:50.240 --> 52:54.240
difficult for a girl to understand well I think boys are difficult to understand

52:54.240 --> 53:00.240
we're not sure we can reach it from above well we'll soon find out

53:00.240 --> 53:04.240
are you coming with a sniff oh I think I'll guard the rear protect the cave

53:04.240 --> 53:12.240
from below oh yeah well someone has to look after the girls someone responsible

53:20.240 --> 53:36.240
oh my goodness it's dark in there let's go in then I don't like the look of it

53:36.240 --> 53:42.240
we'd better stay out here you never know who might live in there don't be silly

53:42.240 --> 53:46.240
no one lives in there that's what I don't like yes exactly a place

53:46.240 --> 53:55.240
with no one living in it is really scary I think we must be right above the cave

53:55.240 --> 54:03.240
here maybe I can't find a hole though let's look a bit more over that way moving

54:03.240 --> 54:10.240

54:10.240 --> 54:17.240

54:17.240 --> 54:23.240

shaky oh wait I sound normally hey be quiet no I can hear something me

55:20.240 --> 55:25.240
too perhaps it's the wind no snorke maiden it sounds like someone moaning

55:25.240 --> 55:29.240
you can't scare me like that no one lives here who want to live here anyway it's dark

55:29.240 --> 55:35.240
and cold it's moment and snuffkin they've climbed out and we can hear their voices

55:35.240 --> 55:42.240
in the distance so we needn't worry why would they be moaning no it's not them I'm

55:42.240 --> 55:52.240

55:52.240 --> 56:10.240

56:35.240 --> 57:04.240
hey are you all right movement yes of course

57:04.240 --> 57:11.240
talk to me movement are you all right oh I don't know I think so my bottom's a little bit sore though

57:11.240 --> 57:17.240
I'm sure I heard somebody scream just now well the Himmelin was down here having a nap

57:17.240 --> 57:22.240
the Himmelin if this is another of your games woman I don't like it Mr. Himmelin

57:22.240 --> 57:25.240
we were climbing down from the top we didn't know you were sleep

57:25.240 --> 57:30.240
that's not quite right I wasn't asleep I wasn't the tall comfortable you know well

57:30.240 --> 57:35.240
what were you doing here then well to tell you the truth I really haven't been quite

57:35.240 --> 57:40.240
myself lately you haven't lost any more rare stabs have you Mr. Himmelin

57:40.240 --> 57:47.240
and the contrary movement I have them all even the rarest every single one

57:47.240 --> 57:53.240
then what's wrong that's good isn't it I mean my collection is complete

57:53.240 --> 57:58.240
and no one in the world has a better stab collection than you have Mr. Himmelin

57:58.240 --> 58:04.240
no of course not mine is perfect there isn't a stamp I haven't got rare ones old ones

58:04.240 --> 58:09.240
misprinted ones I have them all I still don't understand there's no challenge

58:09.240 --> 58:15.240
nothing to search for you're too young and you don't collect stamps oh dear me dear me

58:15.240 --> 58:22.240
I'm beginning to understand he's not a collector anymore he's got all the stamps

58:22.240 --> 58:28.240
he could ever want that's a trouble it's not half as much fun that's why you're sad

58:28.240 --> 58:37.240
isn't it Mr. Himmelin yes it is no fun no fun at all no I understand I can see

58:37.240 --> 58:41.240
why you're upset and me falling on top of you like that did it really help did

58:41.240 --> 58:48.240
it not exactly moment look who was taking a nap in the cave

58:48.240 --> 58:54.240
oh it's you Mr. Himmelin so it must have been his snoring that we heard what a

58:54.240 --> 59:04.240
noise he was making I'd never ever snore you certainly do

59:04.240 --> 59:11.240
Robbys look if you promise not to tell anyone I'll take you to see something very special

59:11.240 --> 59:14.240
what is it

59:18.240 --> 59:37.240
I think it could be repaired of course it could easy but you know you can't always tell

59:37.240 --> 59:42.240
the keel doesn't look too good yes we could take it out to see a no time the sales

59:42.240 --> 59:51.240
got holes in it hey I can't find any owners you can paddle all steer look out friends

59:51.240 --> 01:00:10.240
it's going over hang on everybody I've lost my confidence and it makes me feel very

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:17.240
unhappy well it can happen to anyone you know even to you well not much of course

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:23.240
lucky you I just don't know what to do how can I get it back there must be a way

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:34.240
it's hard to say everybody's different but with me it just happens I don't think

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:41.240
I'll ever invent anything again perhaps I'll have a break from my memoirs too

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.800
tea time oh dear what's the matter with you too you look a bit down in the

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:54.240
dance you know I might have been a bit overconfident me too I think

01:00:54.240 --> 01:01:03.240
there's no need to yell we can hear you watch the matter sniff

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:10.240
we found a boat on the beach come and have a look a shipwreck washed up on the shore

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:17.240
it's not a wreck and it's got a white sail we're going to repair it and then it'll be ours

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:22.240
all right I'm coming come on snork let's take a look at this boat it could be

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:27.240
just the thing the chair is both up so it's got a sail a white sail you say

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:36.240
that could be extremely interesting it's a sturdy little craft is nicely built well

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:46.240
designed she's abandoned so does that we can keep her

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:51.240
it seems to be in pretty good condition except for the hole in the bottom you

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:56.240
know maybe that's why she was abandoned here you could be right softkin finders

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:01.240
keepers you guys of course it makes it our boat you'd have to wait to see if anyone

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:06.240
claims it first little mine what shall we do then papa well first things first

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:13.240
we must repair the hole and then tire up securely in case there's a storm absolutely

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:20.240
then if the owner comes we ought to give her back to him mind you she might know

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:27.240
she's here so what are we going to do when we've repaired her it's bad for boats not

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:38.240
to be yours we could sail the seven seas I'd be happy just to explore around here

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:43.240
don't worry snork maiden if we get big waves we can sail between them isn't that right

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:52.240
moment papa well in a way come on let's get to work how about you snork will you help us

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:59.240
yes of course can I do anything for you moment papa yes if you'd like to Mr. Emulane well

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:04.240
I'm afraid I'm not much of a builder but if there is something I could do well let's

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:11.240
get her out of the water first shall we and we'll need some big logs to go under

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:21.240
I think ten should be enough I'll be safe to work on so we'll want something strong

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:28.240
to keep her upright as well and lots of tools I'll go home and get some and I think we'll

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:35.240
need a bucket and a shovel I'll come with you help you choose yes you go I'll stay

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:38.240
and keep guard in case the owner comes back

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:25.240
sleep well man the top sales what are they all in bed my dear yes dear sleeping

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:31.240
like logs I'm not surprised they all work very very hard today I can't wait until the

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:37.240
boots ready and we can sail off somewhere my dear will go anywhere in the world you like

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:42.240

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:31.240
caring and giving the movements they're always happy and goes at play the

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:42.240
movements are having fun day after day the movements the movements the movements the

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:49.240

movements so come with me give me your hand I'll take you up to a moment land you

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:39.240

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:51.240
were the moments there were the movements there were the movements there were the

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:26.840
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.760
It was a lovely day, and Mumen, his family and friends decided to go for a trip in the

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:49.560
boat they'd found washed up on the beach. They didn't know where they were going, and thought

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.320
it would be much more fun that way.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:55.720
Momma, we're not going away forever, you know.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:56.920
I hope not.

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:59.320
I don't think we'll need all these pots and pans.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.480
It's best to be prepared at sea.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.360
What do you mean?

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.800
Well, you'll only complain if you don't get a hot meal.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.080
I never complain.

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:11.080
And you know how hungry the sea air made you all last time we went out on a boat.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.520
You'd have been glad of food then.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:16.040
You got to rough it a bit if you want an adventure.

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.760
Yes, but it will be more fun with coffee and pancakes.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:23.880
Aren't you too ready yet?

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.080
Hello, Mumen!

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.320
Hi, snorkebagel!

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.760
Whoa!

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.200
Must you use that ladder?

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:51.960
I'm all right.

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.520
Mumen, you're going to hurt yourself one of these days.

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:55.560
It's good practice.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:56.760
It's not coming with us.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.000
He says he hasn't got time for sailing boats at the moment.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.760
I'd much rather a real sailing boat than a paper flying ship any day.

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.640
Our mama and papa are ready yet?

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.640
They're packing a path the kitchen.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.640
Oh, it's too full.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.880
Have we got to take all that with us?

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:21.640
Our mama thinks it's better to be safe than sorry and she's usually right.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:24.840
Tell me, Mumen, where exactly are we going?

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.360
We haven't decided yet.

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.320
That's right.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.360
Wait and see.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:14:02.760
Mr. Hamulin, have you found a rare plan for your collection yet?

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.360
Unfortunately not.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.840
There are lots of these in Mumen Valley already.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.400
Goodness, where are you taking all that?

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.080
We're going sailing.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:14.360
How exciting, charting new seas and exploring desert islands.

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.800
Never know.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:26.040
If I help you load up the boat, can I please come with you?

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:43.560
Captain of Ridge, down the yard arm, hankers away, sailors beware, splice the manbrace,

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:47.880
all hands on deck, full speed ahead.

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.280
Hey, Sniff, any sun of the movements?

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:51.080
Not yet.

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.240
It's a great day to go sailing.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.080
I wonder where we're going.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.840
I don't have any idea.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:59.160
I don't actually like sailing much.

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.160
Do you get sick?

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.520
Well, not really sick.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.440
It's just that I can't swim.

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.480
And if it's rough, it frightens me and I panic a bit.

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.240
It looks like it's going to stay calm.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.120
So don't worry.

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:18.440
Right, that's the lot.

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.280
Now, all aboard.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.040
Mama, little Mai, Stafkin, Moomin,

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:27.800
Snork Maiden, and Mr. Hambylin' of course.

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.320
Isn't he a bit old for adventures?

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.040
Not at all.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:34.360
No, Moomin' Papa has promised to find a deserted island where I shall search for rare plants.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:39.480
Don't you want to go?

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.320
Do you want to go?

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:41.960
No, move it, you.

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.280
Come on, Sniff, hurry up.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:50.440
There's no rum.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.200
Don't be silly, Sniff.

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:52.840
Of course there is.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:58.200
It looks very full, almost thinking.

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.600
There's no way this boat could sink.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:01.880
Now, come on, get him.

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:02.680
Oh.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.360
Really?

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.360
I promise it'll be all right.

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:09.360
Won't it, Papa?

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.360
Well, if it stays like this, it will.

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.360
Moment.

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.360
I'll come next time.

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.360
Let's go, moment, Papa.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.360
He's just a scary cat.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.360
Hmm.

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.360
We'll go without you then, Snape.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.360
Hmm.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.360
I think that will be best.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.360
Anyway, someone had better stay and look after moment house

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:30.360
and it might just as well be me.

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.360
That's very thoughtful of you.

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.360
There's a pancake on the kitchen table

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.360
that you can have for lunch.

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.360
Thank you, Mama.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.360
Have a nice trip.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.360
I wish Sniff had come.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.360
He's a big softie.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:51.360
Well, he's not very good at swimming

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.360
and he does eat rather a lot.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:05.360
This is the life, isn't it, Mama?

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.360
It certainly is, dear.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:10.360
This is the life, isn't it, Mama?

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.360
It certainly is, dear.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:34.360
Oh, look, not a breath of wind.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.360
Shall I start rowing, Papa?

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:39.360
Yes, you'd better get Sniffkin to help you.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.360
Aye-aye, Captain.

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.360
It's hardly moving.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.360
You'll have to do better than that.

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.360
We're doing our best.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.360
You two would be useless as galley slaves.

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:55.360
It's good that we're not then, isn't it?

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.360
So then, what's your excuse?

01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.360
It's not easy rowing against the tide.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.360
You try it.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.360
No, dear, at this rate, I should be lucky

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.360
to find one rare plant.

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.360
Well, Mr. Hamlin, you could always try

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.360
collecting some seaweed instead.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.360
There's plenty of that.

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.360
I have heard tales that if you whistle,

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:16.360
those who perished at sea will send you a wind.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.360
Land! Ahoy!

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.360
Look, Moomin, Papa!

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.360
That's too small to be any good.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:31.360
You're right.

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.360
Hey, look, Papa! We're moving again!

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.360
The tide's turned and the wind's up.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:46.360
What a beautiful island!

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.360
And a perfect place to land, too.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:52.360
Oh, I bet this place has got some rare plants.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.360
Be careful when you explore.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.360
There could be wild animals there.

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.360
Now it's time to go.

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.360
Let's go.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.360
I'll be careful when you explore.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.360
There could be wild animals there.

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.360
Now if someone will go and collect some wood,

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.360
I'll get a fire started.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:13.360
I bet none of you will say no to coffee and pancakes.

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.360
Watch me, you land lovers.

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.360
I'll go and pull the boat ashore.

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.360
I suppose you're right.

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.360
As I said, Papa, it's always better to rough it

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.360
with a little bit of luxury.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.360
I wonder if we're the first to set foot on the island.

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.360
Thank you, children.

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.360
Is there anything else you want us to do?

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.360
No, I don't think so.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.360
Is it okay if I go explore the island?

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:53.360
Of course, off you go.

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.360
Coming, Snork, may done.

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.360
I'll stay and help Moomin Mama with the cooking.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.360
Mama, you said we needed firewood.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.360
Is this enough?

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.360
My goodness for a lot.

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:10.360
You know, I don't think anyone lives on this island.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:14.360
I haven't seen anyone unless they're hiding in the bushes.

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:16.360
I've seen someone.

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.360
Oh yeah?

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.360
Who?

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.360
Well, they weren't very big.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.360
What do you mean, this big?

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.360
Well, same as me.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.360
What did they look like?

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.360
Sort of white and ghostly and not very friendly looking either.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:29.360
Well, you probably just thought you saw something a little mic.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:32.360
I did see them. I did too.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360
Keep your hair on.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.360
I'm not saying you didn't see anything.

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:41.360
Goodness, this is magnificent.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:44.360
Oh, what a find.

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:48.360
And what's this?

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.360
I don't know.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.360
Oh, I don't know anything.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.360
What's this?

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:07.360
What's this?

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:15.360
Oh, well, well, well.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.360
I've never seen such rare and beautiful mountains.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:22.360
It's never seen such rare and beautiful plants.

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:41.360
Well, what's this? Goodness, it's a perimeter.

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:45.360
Now, let's see. Rain and storm. Probably broken.

01:21:48.360 --> 01:22:02.360
Oh, hello. Who are you? Oh, I see. This is your perimeter, isn't it? Now watch it. Mind you don't travel on those flowers, will you?

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:11.360
Oh, no, no, no. They're coming to get me. Don't go away. Don't go away.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:23.360
I think what little my saw was a hatty fattener. They're not ghosts, are they snuffkin? No, they look kind of like it, but they're really harmless enough movement.

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:30.360
Oh, dear, what on earth was that? It sounded like Mr. Hamulin.

01:22:41.360 --> 01:23:10.360
That's it, that's what I saw. It's Mr. Hamulin. Help, get me down.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:20.360
Why are they after you, Mr. Hamulin? What'd you do to them? I don't know. I just tapped on this post and asked them to be careful with the flowers.

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:26.360
They seem a bit angry to me. Well, then I tapped the marrometer to check the weather, and they came at me.

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:31.360
Well, I don't think it's a flower somat about. Maybe they thought you were trying to steal the marrometer.

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:38.360
I don't want it to keep it. My goodness, I'm collecting flowers, not marrometers. Well, hang on.

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:46.360
I can't hang on much longer, hurry, please. They don't look so easily frightened. No, now let me think.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:50.360
Hurry, I'm slipping.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:58.360
I've got it, Mr. Hamulin. The hatty fattener can't see or hear very well, but they are very sensitive. We'll have to try and frighten them.

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:07.360
I suggest you shake the post as hard as you can. Harder, harder, Mr. Hamulin.

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:14.360
Look, they can feel the ground moving. Keep going, Mr. Hamulin.

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:20.360
I'm getting very tired. I've been touched if I can't.

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:25.360
They're not going, it's no fun. Are you sure this will work?

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.360
You can stop now, Mr. Hemmilan.

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.360
Mr. Hemmilan!

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.360
Oh dear!

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:51.360
Hey, are you all right, Mr. Hemmilan?

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:54.360
What disgusting creatures!

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:57.360
I have a good mind to take their precious barometer.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.360
I don't think that's such a good idea.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:02.360
It's no good anyway, it's not working.

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:05.360
How do you know that, Mr. Hemmilan?

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.360
Look, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:12.360
But according to this barometer, it should be pouring down with rain.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.360
This is the way to explore real home cooking.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:20.360
It just takes a little thought.

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:24.360
And woman papa is always prepared, aren't you dear?

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:28.360
Double zero, it can't get any lower than that.

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.360
What does that mean?

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:33.360
If it was working, it would mean being for a terrible storm.

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:39.360
I think the reading might be right after all, Mr. Hemmilan.

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:43.360
See the way the sky is darkening.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:50.360
Look at those storm clouds.

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.360
We better go before it's too late.

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.360
But there won't be time to get home.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.360
We'll be shipwrecked, woman papa.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.360
Surely there's still time.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:01.360
We don't want to go back to moving valley yet.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.360
We've only explored half the island.

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:07.360
Besides, you never know what we might find, Snort Maiden.

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:10.360
I wanted to get my hands on those happy fat nurse.

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:13.360
That's the last thing I wanted to do, little mind, the very last.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.360
I think we ought to leave now.

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.360
What do you think, mama?

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:20.360
Well, you're the captain, dear. It's up to you.

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.360
So I am. Now, let me think.

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.360
Oh.

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.360
Right, we'll stay.

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.360
Oh, can we?

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:53.360
Yes, but we must put the tent up before it starts raining.

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.360
What tent?

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:58.360
Always be prepared. That's my motto.

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:01.360
You're very clever to think of everything.

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:05.360
First, we must lower the sails and pull the boat up

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.360
so that she's out of harm's way.

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.360
That should do it.

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:30.360
Well done, everybody. It should be safe here.

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:34.360
Now hurry with the tent, the storm's nearly here.

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.360
Are you all right, Mr. Himulan?

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.360
You stay here and rest.

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.360
We'll manage without you.

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.360
I am a bit tired.

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:50.360
You get your breath back first, but don't forget to tie the boat to that tree before you come up.

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:53.360
It looks bad. A real humdinger.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.360
You can trust me.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.360
Right, let's get that tent up.

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.360
Oh, dear, what a day.

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.360
Oh, what's this here?

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.360
Oh, yes.

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:30.360
Well, fans, see that I've never seen one of these before.

01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:38.360
Snuffkin?

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:41.360
What's happening?

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:46.360
It's coming really fast. Look at the rain over the sea.

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.360
We're going to get soaked if we stay here.

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.360
Just a minute.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.360
But we'll get wet.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:55.360
I know, but it's so exciting.

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.360
Things which you have no control over.

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:00.360
You can see this great big storm coming towards you.

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:03.360
And you can't do anything about it.

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.360
No.

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:08.360
You have to time it just right.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:12.360
When to make a run for shelter, you mean?

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:15.360
I knew you'd understand.

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.360
I wonder what the Hattie Fatterners are doing.

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.360
Waiting for the thunderstorm.

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.360
Why?

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:27.360
Because they get energy from the electricity and the lightning.

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.360
Really?

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:32.360
That's it. Come on.

01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:35.360
I've never seen rain like this.

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:38.360
It'll be over soon enough, Momen.

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:41.360
You're dressed, Mom.

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.360
I know.

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.360
It's all right.

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:47.360
I'll look for you.

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.360
I know.

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:50.360
It's all right.

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:52.360
I'll look for you.

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:54.360
I'll look for you.

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:56.360
I'll look for you.

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:58.360
I'll look for you.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:00.360
I'll look for you.

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.360
I'll look for you.

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.360
All right.

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.360
I'll look after you.

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:59.360
That was a close one.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:00.360
Too close.

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:01.660
Too close.

01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:04.160
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.760
What a find I made today!

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:37.760
If, like the movements and their friends, you're stranded on the desert island in a huge storm, all you can do is wait until it's blown itself out.

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:43.760
But what if the waves are so high that your boat is caught up and washed out to sea?

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:46.760
That is a different story altogether.

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:21.760
The movements, believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements, they're always happy and always at play.

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:32.760
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements, the movements.

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:50.760
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements, believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements, they're always happy and always at play.

01:32:50.760 --> 01:33:07.760
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements, the movements, the movements.

01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:50.760
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the

01:33:50.760 --> 01:34:15.380
movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements

01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:50.760
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

01:34:50.760 --> 01:35:12.440
bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba I think that Royal

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.780
He's getting loose.

01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:15.840
OK, Moonman, you'd better have a look

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:18.160
before this wind has the whole tent down.

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:18.960
The eye, Captain.

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:24.640
A sudden storm has hit the hafifat in his island.

01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:33.400
Moonman Papa has decided that it would be far safer

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.520
to stay the night on the island,

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.840
so they put up the tent and moored the boat.

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:44.840
This will show us what the weather's up to.

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:46.840
That's as long as it's still working.

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.840
I'm sure it's going to die down really soon.

01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:51.840
Oh, wake up, Mr. Hemelon.

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:54.640
When the storm clears, we must give this barometer

01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:56.640
straight back to the hafifat in his.

01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:01.640
Oh, I quite fancy keeping it myself to remind me of the island.

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:04.640
You know, it seems to work after all.

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:08.640
But Mr. Hemelon, that'll only work for you.

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.640
What about all the tons of plants you found?

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.640
That surely is going to be enough.

01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:17.640
Yes, I know, but there was only really one special flower

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:20.640
amongst all those plants, and I nearly missed that one.

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:22.640
Look, isn't it a beauty?

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.640
I discovered it as I was about to tie up the boat.

01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:28.640
Oh, woman, Papa.

01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:30.640
Yes, Mr. Hemelon.

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.640
You know, when you all went to put up the tent,

01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:36.640
you told me that I was about to tie up the boat.

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:39.640
So she was safe.

01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.640
Yes, of course.

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.640
Well, I'm not sure if I did.

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:45.640
Not sure at all.

01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:49.640
Please, try to remember, Mr. Hemelon.

01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:50.640
I can't.

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:53.640
It's all very unpear in my mind.

01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:57.640
If the boat's not here, we'll be stuck on the island forever and ever.

01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:01.640
Oh, we pulled it well ashore, so it should be okay.

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:04.640
But we'd better check on it as soon as we can.

01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:06.640
I'll go have a look.

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.640
Quickly, moment.

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:09.640
Be careful.

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:10.640
I remember.

01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:13.640
I was just going to do it when I spotted this flower.

01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:15.640
Just by a rocket was...

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:16.640
Oh, dear.

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:19.640
Woman.

01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:22.640
Woman.

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:38.640
Boy, that was close.

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:42.640
Tie it to the tree and make sure it's tight.

01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:45.640
That should do it.

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:47.640
Just in time.

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:50.640
You know the waves must have been huge to reach this far.

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:52.640
Well, we saved the boat.

01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:53.640
Yes.

01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:58.640
Well, this storm will be over soon.

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:06.640
Is everything okay?

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.640
Yep, everything's fine.

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:10.640
Oh, thank goodness.

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.640
So we're not stranded after all.

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.640
Huh? No.

01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:16.640
We needn't have worried.

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:18.640
I'm very sorry.

01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:20.640
Really, I am.

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:23.640
Are you alright, Snort Maiden?

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:25.640
Now I am.

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:43.640
According to this, the storm is blowing over now

01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:45.640
and it should stop raining soon.

01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:47.640
Well, the wind seems to have dropped.

01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:51.640
Oh, good. All that thunder and lightning is so noisy.

01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:53.640
Ah, right.

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:58.640
I think I'll just go for a bit of a walk before I settle down for the night.

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:01.640
But it's much too dark to see anything.

01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:04.640
The fresh air will do me good.

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.640
That's a good idea.

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:11.640
I could do with some fresh air myself.

01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:13.640
Wait for me. I'll come too.

01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:15.640
Let me in quicker than mine.

01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:19.640
There's still there hundreds of them all glowing.

01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:21.640
The hatty fat nurse.

01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:23.640
They're waiting for us.

01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:34.640
The lightning must have recharged them.

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.640
Look at them all.

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:39.640
I wonder what they want, Snort Maiden.

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.640
Such a heavy storm would have given them lots and lots of energy.

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.640
Gosh, they're ready for anything.

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:49.640
They're not coming any closer.

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:51.640
They seem fairly friendly.

01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:53.640
Maybe they just want to see what we look like.

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:55.640
No, I know what they're here for.

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:57.640
Oh, what's that, Snuffkin?

01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:59.640
It's their barometer, Moomin Papa.

01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:03.640
They know we've got it and they've come to get it back from us.

01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.640
Yes, I think you're right, Snuffkin.

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.640
Mr. Hamilton?

01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:12.640
I do think you'd better give it back to them.

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:14.640
Do I have to?

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:16.640
Yes, of course.

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:20.640
After all it is there isn't there are a lot of them.

01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:24.640
Look, why don't you take it out to them now?

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:32.640
You know the barometer does belong to the Mr. Hamilton.

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.640
Oh, dear, dear.

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:36.640
Give it to me.

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:39.640
Let me do it, Papa.

01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:41.640
Well done, my boy.

01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:45.640
You must be careful, my dear.

01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:47.640
Don't worry, Mama.

01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:49.640
A boy isn't he brave.

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.640
I think this is what you've come for.

01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:19.640
Here you are.

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:21.640
You can have it back now.

01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:34.640
Moomin!

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.640
Moomin!

01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:42.640
Are you all right, Moomin?

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:44.640
I'll tell you something.

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:47.640
I'm real glad there's no electricity where we live.

01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:50.640
Oh, they didn't hurt you, did they?

01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:52.640
Ah! Go away!

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.640
Leave her alone!

01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:57.640
Are you all right, Snorkemaiden?

01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:59.640
What did he do to you?

01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:01.640
Just a bit.

01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:04.640
Are you all right, Snorkemaiden?

01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:05.640
What did he do to you?

01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:08.640
Just a bit of shock, that's all.

01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:11.640
What's that funny smell?

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:15.640
Oh, my god, it's your hair.

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:16.640
What?

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:19.640
What do you mean?

01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:21.640
What's happened to it?

01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:22.640
Oh, no, my hair.

01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:24.640
Mama, Mama!

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.640
Where's your mirror?

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:26.640
Oh, Mama.

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:30.640
Oh, look at what those wicked, hatty fat nurse have done.

01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:34.640
It's here in my handbag somewhere.

01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:36.640
Hurry, Mama!

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.640
I must see what's happened to my hair.

01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:40.640
Here you are, dear.

01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:42.640
Look at me!

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:43.640
Look at me!

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:45.640
It's awful!

01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:48.640
It's horrible!

01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:50.640
Don't worry, we'll put some magic ointment on

01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.640
and it'll come back all lovely and curly.

01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:55.640
I don't want nasty curly hair.

01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:59.640
I want my long, beautiful hair like it was before.

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:06.640
You know, it really doesn't matter to me, Snort Maiden.

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:16.640
Oh, God, oh, God, I hope that's the last we see of them.

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.640
Oh, dear, what's happened to Snort Maiden?

01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:27.640
My hair, my hair, where's my hair?

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:54.640
My hair, my hair.

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:24.640
My hair, my hair.

01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:53.640
Wake up, woman.

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:55.640
We've got to hurry.

01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.640
I wonder where they're going.

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:18.640
Perhaps we're saving a way to a secret island.

01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:21.640
Somewhere very far away from here where they can live happily

01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:23.640
on their own together.

01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:29.640
Gosh, Snort Maiden, they're really weird.

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:32.640
Well, it depends on how you look at it, woman.

01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:35.640
They probably think we're a bit strange, too.

01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:40.640
Snort Maiden, you're a bit strange, too.

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:48.640
Snort Maiden, you're really horrible.

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:50.640
You knew I wanted to see them.

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:53.640
Come on, you were fast asleep.

01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:54.640
Snoring your head off.

01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:57.640
That wasn't me snoring that was Mr. Himulin.

01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:58.640
All right.

01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:00.640
If you say so.

01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:03.640
Well, I hope that's the last I'll see of them.

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:04.640
Me, too.

01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:07.640
That's a very pretty scarf, Snort Maiden.

01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:09.640
Yes, it is, isn't it?

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:12.640
Can we go exploring, Mama?

01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:14.640
I don't see why not.

01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:16.640
It looks as though it'll be a nice day

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:20.640
and there'll be lots of exciting things washed up by the storm.

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.640
Oh, that'll be fun.

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:24.640
Let's look for the other side of the island.

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:25.640
What a good idea.

01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:28.640
I might discover some more plants.

01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.640
Mr. Himulin, hurry up, sir.

01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:40.640
Or it will be dark before we get there.

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.640
You go on, Momen.

01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:45.640
I just want to have a better look at these flowers.

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:48.640
Yes, all right.

01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:52.640
Very interesting.

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:58.640
Just think we could find all sorts of things lying on the sand.

01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:01.640
I hope it's secret, sunken treasure.

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.640
Well, let's hope it's not sunken anymore.

01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:05.640
I expect there'll be lots and lots of treasures

01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:07.640
from shipwrecks and things like that.

01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:10.640
But I find it before you.

01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.640
Oh, no, you won't.

01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:27.640
Look at all this.

01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:30.640
I'm going to dive in.

01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:34.640
What's that over there?

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:37.640
It's quite shallow right here.

01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:40.640
Well, there must be something admit it.

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:42.640
Oh, dear, it's empty.

01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:45.640
I think I found something here.

01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:51.640
Little lie, little lie.

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.640
What's the matter?

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.640
Come and see these beautiful shelves I have.

01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:58.640
I'm too busy hunting for treasure

01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:01.640
to bother with shells.

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:11.640
Hey, what's this?

01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.640
What?

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:19.640
Oh, look at this one.

01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:21.640
I've got a real collection here.

01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:24.640
Got a lovely mama's garden.

01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:33.640
Wow, watch that.

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:35.640
What?

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:38.640
I can't find any as nice as yours.

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:41.640
Don't be in such an awful hurry, little lie.

01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:43.640
Shnark maiden!

01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:44.640
Shnark maiden!

01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:45.640
Look!

01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:47.640
Look what I found.

01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:49.640
A proper treasure.

01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:51.640
Look!

01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:53.640
Whoa!

01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:56.640
There's snow inside of it.

01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:59.640
I found it in a cave.

01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:02.640
What is it?

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:04.640
What's this?

01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:06.640
It's a ship telescope.

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:08.640
You can see for miles with it.

01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:10.640
I'll give it to Papa.

01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:13.640
It's better than anything I got.

01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:18.640
Hey, everybody, I found something.

01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:20.640
Come on up and have a look.

01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:23.640
I wish I could find something interesting.

01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:30.640
Have you found some buried treasure?

01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:37.640
What a big lady.

01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:38.640
Is she dead?

01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:40.640
It's made of wood, Snork maiden.

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:43.640
It's a figurehead from a ship.

01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.640
She's like a queen.

01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:55.640
Ha!

01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:58.640
She hasn't got any legs, though.

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:02.640
Why don't we put her on the front of our boat?

01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:04.640
Nah, it's much too heavy.

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:07.640
It must have come from a ship that was wrecked.

01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:09.640
And Sank had seen?

01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:12.640
Perhaps it did.

01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:15.640
And all hands were lost.

01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:18.640
I want to take it home.

01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:20.640
What would you do with it?

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:23.640
Use it or frighten people away.

01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:31.640
Help! Somebody help me, please!

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:33.640
That's old, Mr. Hamilton.

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:36.640
Gosh, I hope it's not more haddy fattiners.

01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:38.640
Someone help, please!

01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:40.640
We're coming!

01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:49.640
Woman, why do you like this old figurehead so much?

01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:51.640
You're staring at her.

01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:53.640
She's not all that special, you know?

01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:55.640
Yes, I know.

01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:56.640
She's not even real.

01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:58.640
Only made of wood.

01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:03.640
Do you like her eyes?

01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:05.640
Or is it her hair?

01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:08.640
Just because I haven't got any?

01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:10.640
Nearly there, just a bit further.

01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:12.640
Come on, snuffed it for you.

01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:15.640
You're very heavy, Mr. Hamilton.

01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:17.640
Oh, thank you, Snuffed Kid.

01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:19.640
You saved my life.

01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:21.640
Oh!

01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:24.640
Boy, how'd you end up there, Mr. Hamilton?

01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:26.640
One minute, I was looking for plants.

01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:29.640
The next I'd fall and ride into that hole.

01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:32.640
I think you'd be safe for collecting stamps, Mr. Hamilton.

01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:34.640
Oh, no, it's not.

01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:36.640
It's not.

01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:38.640
It's not.

01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:41.640
You'd be safe for collecting stamps, Mr. Hamilton.

01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:43.640
Oh, no, it's not here.

01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:45.640
Where is it?

01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:48.640
What is it now?

01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:50.640
Tell me.

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:52.640
Make a move and preserve me.

01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:54.640
Calm down, Mr. Hamilton.

01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:56.640
Tell me what's the matter?

01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:58.640
My sample box, my sample box.

01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:00.640
Oh, my goodness.

01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:03.640
You didn't leave it in the hole, did you?

01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:05.640
Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:07.640
Oh, dear.

01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:08.640
Oh, she's samples.

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:09.640
I'm so silly.

01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:11.640
Oh, Snuffed Kid.

01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:14.640
Oh.

01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:16.640
Oh, Snuffed Kid, would you mind?

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:17.640
Okay.

01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:18.640
Anything for some peace.

01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:21.640
Oh, dear boy, you are wonderful.

01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:24.640
You shall have one of my rarest plants as a reward.

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:25.640
Indeed, you shall.

01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:27.640
I shall choose a magnificent one for you.

01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:29.640
Thank you very much, Mr. Hamilton.

01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:32.640
Gosh, your one-word movement is.

01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:36.640
Oh, there you are.

01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:37.640
What have you been up to?

01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:41.640
He can't take his eyes off that silly wooden lady.

01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:43.640
He just dares at her.

01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:44.640
Really?

01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:45.640
I do not.

01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:48.640
I just think she has a very beautiful face.

01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:52.640
Well, Moomin, now that you're here, I could really do with your help.

01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:54.640
What do you want, Snuffed Kid?

01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:58.640
Mr. Hamilton dropped his box of samples down this hole and I'm going to try and get it.

01:52:58.640 --> 01:52:59.640
I didn't drop it.

01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:03.640
I fell in the hole and just forgot it when Snuffed can pull me out.

01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:05.640
You're a bit absent-minded, Mr. Hamilton.

01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:06.640
No, I'm not.

01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:10.640
I can remember every Latin name of every single plant, you know.

01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:12.640
Okay, I'll go down, Moomin.

01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:14.640
But you'll have to help me get back up.

01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:15.640
Okay.

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:17.640
I'll help you too.

01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:18.640
Now be careful.

01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:20.640
Can you see it yet, Snuffed Kid?

01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:22.640
I'm not down at the bottom yet.

01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:23.640
Oh, forgive me.

01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:24.640
I'm sorry.

01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:25.640
I found it.

01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:27.640
Wonderful.

01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:30.640
Tell me, are the plants all right?

01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:32.640
You can check them yourself in a minute.

01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:37.640
Oh.

01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:41.640
Are you all right, Snuffed Kid?

01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:42.640
Wait a minute.

01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:44.640
I found something else.

01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:47.640
Oh, look.

01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:49.640
There's the boat.

01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:51.640
It's Moomin, Moomin, Papa.

01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:53.640
Hello.

01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:00.640
It's gold.

01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:01.640
Hello.

01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:03.640
We've been hunting treasure.

01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:09.640
Go and get Moomin, Papa. I found gold.

01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:12.640
Boy, oh boy, I wonder how much there is.

01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:14.640
Moomin, Papa, we'll know.

01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:27.640
Well, Moomin, Papa, what should we do with all this beautiful gold?

01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:30.640
It would look lovely in the garden, don't you think?

01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:33.640
With all the shells that the snork made and found,

01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:35.640
they'll look good in amongst the roses.

01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:37.640
What do you think, Mama?

01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:39.640
I'm sure they will, Papa.

01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:40.640
I'm sure they will.

01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:48.640
Moomin, she's only a stupid, legless doll.

01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:52.640
You can have my bowl full of snowsknot, Maiden.

01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:53.640
No, thanks.

01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:55.640
Well, I'll look after it for you.

01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:57.640
I can pretend it's my treasure.

01:54:57.640 --> 01:54:58.640
Oh.

01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:08.640
And that was the end of their first adventure in the new boat.

01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:13.640
Moomin, Papa, decided that it was much more fun to set off without maps and sea charts.

01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:16.640
You never know where you might end up.

01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:28.640
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:35.640
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:39.640
They're always happy and always at play.

01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:43.640
The movements are having fun day after day.

01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:46.640
The movements.

01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:50.640
The movements.

01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:57.640
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:04.640
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:09.640
They're always happy and always at play.

01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:12.640
The movements are having fun day after day.

01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:16.640
The movements.

01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:20.640
The movements.

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:26.640
The movements.

01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:48.640
Here they are for one and all.

01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:51.640
The movements are about to come.

01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:54.640
Come on and sit down here with me.

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:56.640
They're here for you on your TV.

01:56:56.640 --> 01:56:59.640
They are the movements.

01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:02.640
They are the movements.

01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:05.640
So come with me, give me your hand.

01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:08.640
I'll take you up to a moment land.

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:11.640
You can fly just like a bird.

01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:13.640
Sing that song ever.

01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:16.640
There were the movements.

01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:19.640
There were the movements.

01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:22.640
There were the movements.

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:25.640
There were the movements.

01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:29.640
There were the movements.

01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:04.640
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:18.640
Now it's very nice to get letters

01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:20.640
at least every now and then

01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:25.640
however in Moomin Valley they're rarely sent or received

01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:28.640
and yet they do have letterboxes

01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:30.640
and even postman

01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:38.640
Oho! Moomin!

01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:43.640
Hello! Is that for me?

01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:50.640
A letter for the Moomin!

01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:53.640
He's gonna fall in this time!

01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:54.640
What?

01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:57.640
Come on, this way, towards me, come on!

01:58:58.640 --> 01:58:59.640
Come on!

01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:02.640
Oh! I got him!

01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:04.640
Did you dig that hole?

01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:06.640
Yeah, no work, didn't it?

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:10.640
All right, who's responsible for this?

01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:12.640
Are you all right?

01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:15.640
Did you dig this hole, young Moomin?

01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:16.640
Of course not!

01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:18.640
Who was it then?

01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:21.640
I knew I should have known!

01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:23.640
Come here, you just wait!

01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:25.640
Uh, hold on, Mr. Postman!

01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:27.640
Can I help my letter, please?

01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:29.640
Just do wait!

01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:51.640
Here's the letter, Mama!

01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:55.640
Hmm?

01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:57.640
A goodness, a letter!

01:59:57.640 --> 01:59:59.640
I think it's from Mumble!

01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:01.640
Oh, really?

02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:03.640
Where's Little Mai, Moomin?

02:00:03.640 --> 02:00:05.640
Well, she's um...

02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:08.640
So, who's this letter from?

02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:10.640
It's from my sister Mumble, isn't it?

02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:12.640
Oh, should I know?

02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:14.640
She went on holiday to get away from me!

02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:17.640
I bet she's coming back because she's missed all the fun!

02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:20.640
She'd stay away if she had at least sensed!

02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:23.640
This is the third time I've fallen into a hole!

02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:28.640
Yes, I know, but this is only the first time I've seen you do it!

02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:31.640
What a horrible little child you are!

02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:33.640
Archie!

02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:34.640
Whoop!

02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:35.640
That was close!

02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:37.640
Go on, follow us!

02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:38.640
Whoop!

02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:40.640
Whoop!

02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:41.640
Whoop!

02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:44.640
Come here, wait till I get my hands on you!

02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:47.640
Mumble says that she's coming back!

02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:50.640
She feels that she's ready to cope with Little Mai again!

02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:52.640
Oh, that's good news, Moomin, Mama!

02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:55.640
I think that we should go and give her house a good clean!

02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:58.640
Have you told Little Mai now Mumble's coming?

02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:00.640
She'll be able to go home!

02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:04.640
No, I expect the postman is still chasing her around the garden!

02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:07.640
Don't tell me why I don't want to know!

02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:10.640
Mama!

02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:11.640
Mama!

02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:13.640
Is the letter from Mumble?

02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:15.640
What does she have to say?

02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:17.640
Is she coming home?

02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:24.640
And a few days later, Mumble returned to Moomin Valley.

02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:30.640
Now Mumble is a lot bigger and prettier than Little Mai,

02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:33.640
and what's more, she's a lot quieter.

02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:38.640
That's Moomin Valley, over there!

02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:41.640
It's not full of creepy crawlies, is it?

02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:43.640
Not as far as I know!

02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:46.640
Is there a house over there?

02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:48.640
Maybe there have food, let's go!

02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:50.640
Oh, that's Moomin House!

02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:58.640
Are you going to Moomin Valley, too?

02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:02.640
Yes, we thought we would!

02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:04.640
That's nice, so am I!

02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:06.640
We can go together!

02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:09.640
Your suitcase looks very heavy!

02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:11.640
Would you like a hand with me?

02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:15.640
Okay!

02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:18.640
Are they nice to people that live in that house?

02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:20.640
Yes, they are!

02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:22.640
Can we stay there?

02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:23.640
I'm sure you can!

02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:25.640
My little sister is staying with them!

02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:27.640
Follow me, I know the way!

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:28.640
Shall we go?

02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:35.640
What's the matter?

02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:37.640
Nothing! We're following you!

02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:39.640
All right!

02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:48.640
Mumbo!

02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:54.640
Hello, how are you?

02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:55.640
Fine, you!

02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:56.640
Fine!

02:02:56.640 --> 02:02:58.640
Do you have a nice rest without me?

02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:00.640
Come on, everybody's waiting to see you!

02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:06.640
Oh, by the way, I'm at two very small strangers who said they were coming here!

02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:09.640
Coming here, Mumbo?

02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:13.640
Yes, they're about the same size as Little Mai!

02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:17.640
Both a bit odd and they're carrying a very large suitcase!

02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:21.640
Right, I'd better make them up a small double bed then!

02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:23.640
Thanks for the tea!

02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:26.640
Now, are you ready to come home with me now, Little Mai?

02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:28.640
No, not yet!

02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:30.640
We've got to go home and tidy the house!

02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:32.640
It hasn't been aired for the whole winter!

02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:34.640
It's all right, Mumbo!

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:39.640
I cleaned and swept the floors the other day and opened all the doors and windows!

02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:41.640
Thank you very much!

02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:46.640
It must have been a relief to be asleep most of the time with Little Mai's been staying with you!

02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:49.640
They said they haven't been bored once since we woke up!

02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:51.640
And we've had a really good time together!

02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:53.640
Isn't that right, Mumbo?

02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:58.640
Bye now!

02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:02.640
Well, well!

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:04.640
There's well, well me, Papa!

02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:08.640
Just that I might be able to hear myself think again now!

02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:10.640
I know what you mean!

02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:18.640
You're not, thingamy!

02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:20.640
No, it's your turn to be great!

02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:22.640
What if they scream when they see us?

02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:25.640
But the lady told us they would friendly thingamy!

02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:34.640
Go on, do it!

02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:40.640
Excuse me?

02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:54.640
Now, what's the matter with you, too?

02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:57.640
Don't forget your suitcase, will you?

02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:00.640
What can we do?

02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:04.640
It's all right, don't be frightened, I won't eat you!

02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:08.640
I'm the police inspector here, been in the valley for years!

02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:10.640
Police!

02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:11.640
Oh no!

02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:13.640
We're not thieves!

02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:15.640
I'm all in the same day!

02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:17.640
I'm all in the same day!

02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:20.640
Well, nobody said that you did!

02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:23.640
Then you haven't come to arrest us!

02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:24.640
Have you?

02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:26.640
Of course I haven't!

02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:28.640
I've come to see the movement family!

02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:34.640
It is ours, suitcase!

02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:35.640
It is!

02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:37.640
Of course it is!

02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:39.640
Now, have you come to see the movements, too?

02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:42.640
Hello?

02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:47.640
Oh, there you are, I thought it was you!

02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:52.640
Are you expecting these two guests, movement mama?

02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:54.640
I think so!

02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:57.640
And they've got a suitcase, so they must be staying!

02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:58.640
That's nice!

02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:00.640
You will stay, won't you?

02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:02.640
Is it all right with you?

02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:04.640
Of course it is!

02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:06.640
I'm movement mama!

02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:09.640
I'm thingany, and this is my friend Bob, movement mama!

02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:10.640
You're welcome!

02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:13.640
Come in and make yourselves at home!

02:06:13.640 --> 02:06:16.640
I think it'll be okay, thingany.

02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:20.640
Careful!

02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:21.640
Hi!

02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:26.640
They are a bit strange, aren't they?

02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:28.640
Yes, definitely!

02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:30.640
So, what can I do for you today, Inspector?

02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:35.640
Oh, well, I heard that mumble was back from holiday, so...

02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:37.640
Yes, that's right!

02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:38.640
Oh!

02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:40.640
Are you here now?

02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:44.640
No inspector, I'm afraid she's gone home with little Mai!

02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:45.640
Oh, right!

02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:48.640
I have to keep an eye on things, you know?

02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:49.640
Very important!

02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:52.640
Who goes away? Who comes back?

02:06:55.640 --> 02:06:58.640
Well, I'll say goodbye then, movement mama!

02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:03.640
I do believe he's fallen for mumble!

02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:05.640
But has she fallen for him?

02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:06.640
I wonder!

02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:07.640
What are the new guests doing?

02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:09.640
Looking scared mostly!

02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:11.640
Who one...

02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:12.640
Do one...

02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:14.640
Do one...

02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:21.640
Do one...

02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:31.640
Here you are!

02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:33.640
I've emptied these drawers for you!

02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:34.640
There should be enough room!

02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:36.640
Thank you, movement!

02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:45.640
Where should we put this suitcase?

02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:47.640
Let's see!

02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:50.640
In this drawer?

02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:55.640
It's a good place to hide, too!

02:07:55.640 --> 02:07:57.640
Oh, look at this!

02:07:57.640 --> 02:07:59.640
It made such a pretty bad voice!

02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:01.640
I like the movements!

02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:03.640
They didn't scream at all!

02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:09.640
You still gotta be careful, though!

02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:22.640
We've had some very strange people staying at our house,

02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:25.640
but I think these two are really weird!

02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:27.640
Well, they're Northerners!

02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:30.640
I guess so, with names like Thingamy and Bob!

02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:32.640
And that suitcase?

02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:36.640
They look a lot like fugitives to me, Snuffkin!

02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:39.640
And perhaps they're dangerous criminals on the run?

02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:41.640
Do you want to see them?

02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:44.640
Yeah, I wouldn't mind, movement!

02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:49.640
Ah!

02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:13.640
Ah, there you are!

02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:15.640
What are they doing now?

02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:16.640
No idea!

02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:20.640
I couldn't hear anything, so they must be asleep!

02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:22.640
We think they're fugitives, movement, Papa!

02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:24.640
They're probably on the run from the law!

02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:28.640
Well, they are a bit funny about their suitcase!

02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:30.640
Gold coins!

02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:32.640
Stolen state secrets!

02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:33.640
Arsonists!

02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:36.640
We better hide all the matches, Papa!

02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:38.640
Public enemies, numbers one and two,

02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:41.640
but they don't look like it, though!

02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:43.640
How about some tea?

02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:44.640
Snuffkin? Smith?

02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:45.640
Yes, please!

02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:47.640
Any cakes as well?

02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:10.640
Thingamy?

02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:16.640
Oh!

02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:20.640
Oh no!

02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:22.640
This suitcase is gone, too!

02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:23.640
What am I going to do?

02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:24.640
Oh!

02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:26.640
What am I going to do?

02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:28.640
What am I going to do?

02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:29.640
You wake already?

02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:30.640
Oh!

02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:33.640
What a nerfie you're doing under the bed!

02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:35.640
It's the safest place!

02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:37.640
Something's about to happen, though!

02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:38.640
Ah!

02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:39.640
I can feel her coming!

02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:41.640
That's what woke me up!

02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:42.640
Don't be silly!

02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:43.640
She can't know we're here!

02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:44.640
Yeah!

02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:45.640
She can!

02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:47.640
And I know she'll be here to hide!

02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:58.640
Well, it's very windy tonight, moment!

02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:00.640
Well, chilly, too!

02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:01.640
Don't you think?

02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:04.640
Oh, hello!

02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:09.640
Did you sleep well?

02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:11.640
Would you like some tea?

02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:13.640
Hey, so that's them!

02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:14.640
Don't worry!

02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:16.640
These are good friends of mine!

02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:17.640
Let me introduce you!

02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:19.640
Sniff and Snuffkin!

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:23.640
And what's the matter?

02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:28.640
She's coming!

02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:29.640
Yes, she is!

02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:32.640
Well, who is my dear?

02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:33.640
The girl!

02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:34.640
The girl!

02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:36.640
Yes, she's terrible!

02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:37.640
Who?

02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:40.640
Oh, you know who she is?

02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:42.640
Yes, I've never seen her!

02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:44.640
But I've heard she's a scary monster, all right?

02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:45.640
Scary monster?

02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:47.640
And this, uh, grope is after you!

02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:49.640
Yes, she is!

02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:03.640
Now, don't you worry!

02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:06.640
She'll think twice before she tangles with me!

02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:07.640
Well, see?

02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:09.640
If she's a scary monster!

02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:11.640
Monster or not?

02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:14.640
If you're a guest in Moomin House, nothing will harm you!

02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:15.640
Right, everyone!

02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:18.640
Lock all the doors and you two go to your room!

02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:20.640
Thank you, Moomin Papa!

02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:22.640
Nobody is going to get in here!

02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:24.640
Well said!

02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:27.640
To Am's family, to Am's!

02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:30.640
Ready for more tea, anyone?

02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:34.640
What's the matter?

02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:37.640
We're going to be attacked by a huge scary monster!

02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:38.640
Heavens!

02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:41.640
You'd better get the frying pan, Mama!

02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:43.640
Oh dear!

02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:51.640
All right, has everyone got a weapon?

02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:07.640
Alright, now, let's finish the list before we go!

02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:29.640
What?

02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:36.640
Well, it's midnight.

02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:39.640
I don't believe in that stupid grog.

02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:41.640
I hope you're right.

02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:51.640
She's coming! She's here!

02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:53.640
Yes, she's very close now.

02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:07.640
I'm going home.

02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:10.640
This is silly.

02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:12.640
We can't wait up all night.

02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:14.640
Besides, I'm getting very sleepy.

02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:16.640
It's up to you.

02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:18.640
Right. I'm going, man. Mom and Papa.

02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:19.640
Watch your back.

02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:23.640
Yes. Keep in the open.

02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:26.640
You guys are only trying to frighten me.

02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:29.640
Well, it won't work.

02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:36.640
She's here.

02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:38.640
No, she's not.

02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:40.640
There are no such things as monsters.

02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:43.640
Just a trap blowing a candle, though.

02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:55.640
You see? There's nobody there.

02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:00.640
Well, in that case, there's nothing to stop you going home, Sniff.

02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:07.640
Do you think I'm scared?

02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:08.640
You're making it up.

02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:09.640
Come on, admit it.

02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:10.640
There aren't any grog.

02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:13.640
Not at all.

02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:30.640
You see? There's no one here at all.

02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:35.640
Oh.

02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:52.640
Oh, be careful. Watch what you're doing.

02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:54.640
It's here. It's here.

02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:55.640
Where?

02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:59.640
Right outside that door. Big and black and horrible.

02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:00.640
Right.

02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:05.640
No, don't open it. You'll get in.

02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:08.640
Come on, everybody.

02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:16.640
Well, there's nobody here, Sniff.

02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:17.640
Are you sure?

02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:25.640
I can't see anything.

02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:30.640
Well, I must have scared that silly old grog away, moment.

02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:34.640
That will teach her to come sniffing around here, all right?

02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:36.640
No, that she is.

02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:53.640
Mm-hmm. Mrs. Groke, we'd like you to go home.

02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:55.640
Now, you just go on.

02:16:57.640 --> 02:16:59.640
You're upsetting our guests.

02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:01.640
And you're freezing my roses.

02:17:01.640 --> 02:17:03.640
Yes, you've been bullied.

02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:07.640
I'm sorry, but you really must leave.

02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:09.640
Please go before I count to ten.

02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:22.640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine and a half.

02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:26.640
All right.

02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:50.640
All right.

02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:52.640
Hey.

02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:54.640
What?

02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:57.640
Hey, are you all right, moment?

02:17:57.640 --> 02:17:59.640
Look at the ground.

02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:03.640
It's all frozen.

02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:16.640
That's a Groke's voice.

02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:18.640
It's cold.

02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:19.640
Isn't it?

02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:21.640
I don't think she'll be back tonight.

02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:24.640
Let's all go in and have a hot drink.

02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:28.640
The Groke didn't come back that night.

02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:31.640
But what did she want in movement house?

02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:38.640
And will she return perhaps another night when they're all asleep?

02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:45.640
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:53.640
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:57.640
They're always happy and always at play.

02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:01.640
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:04.640
The movements.

02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:08.640
The movements.

02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:14.640
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:22.640
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:26.640
They're always happy and always at play.

02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:30.640
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:33.640
The movements.

02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:37.640
The movements.

02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:44.640
The movements.

02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:51.640
The movements.

02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:57.640
The movements.

02:19:57.640 --> 02:20:03.640
The movements.

02:20:03.640 --> 02:20:09.640
The movements.

02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:12.640
The movements.

02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:15.640
They're for you on your TV.

02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:18.640
They are the movements.

02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:21.640
They are the movements.

02:20:21.640 --> 02:20:24.640
So come with me, give me your hand.

02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:27.640
I'll take you up to a moment land.

02:20:27.640 --> 02:20:30.640
You can fly just like a bird.

02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:33.640
Sing that song ever.

02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:36.640
There were the movements.

02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:39.640
There were the movements.

02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:42.640
There were the movements.

02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:45.640
There were the movements.

02:20:45.640 --> 02:20:49.640
There were the movements.

02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:19.640
There were the movements.

02:21:19.640 --> 02:21:23.640
There were the movements.

02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:44.640
With all the excitement of that night,

02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:49.640
Sniff decided not to go home and was sharing movement's bed.

02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:53.640
Snuffkin, as always, preferred to sleep in his tent.

02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:55.640
You remember what happened?

02:21:55.640 --> 02:22:01.640
The horrible grok coming after thingamy and bob and everything freezing?

02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:08.640
For a moment, however, the night wasn't quite over yet.

02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:13.640
Mommy, papa, help me.

02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:18.640
The grok is after me.

02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:26.640
I can't run anymore.

02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:31.640
I can't run anymore.

02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:52.640
Why am I on the floor?

02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:55.640
Sniff?

02:22:57.640 --> 02:23:01.640
Good morning, mama.

02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:03.640
Good morning, moving.

02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:04.640
Is Sniff up yet?

02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:06.640
You're joking.

02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:08.640
Where's the thingamy and bob?

02:23:08.640 --> 02:23:10.640
They haven't stirred yet.

02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:15.640
The poor things are tired out.

02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:17.640
Papa's not still asleep, is he?

02:23:17.640 --> 02:23:22.640
No, he's looking at my rose bushes.

02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:24.640
Are they okay, papa?

02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:27.640
No, frozen to death and look.

02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:28.640
What?

02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:35.640
That's where she was standing over there where the grass is dead.

02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:38.640
She must have been real cold to freeze the roses.

02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:40.640
What a shame. They were very pretty.

02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:42.640
There's not much left of them now.

02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:45.640
We'll have to grow some new ones.

02:23:45.640 --> 02:23:48.640
I dreamed that she was chasing me, papa.

02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:49.640
Oh, don't worry, moment.

02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:52.640
I think she's only after thingamy and bob.

02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:55.640
So they're not fugitives from justice after all?

02:23:55.640 --> 02:23:59.640
I have a feeling that they would prefer that moment.

02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:09.640
Aren't thingamy and bob coming down?

02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:12.640
Yes, if they could have breakfast in their room if you didn't mind.

02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:14.640
Well, what did they tell you?

02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:15.640
What?

02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:17.640
About why the groke is chasing them.

02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:22.640
Oh, they just looked terrified and wouldn't say anything about her at all.

02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:25.640
You know, we really ought to find out why.

02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:27.640
Yes, you're right.

02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:31.640
Mom and mom, why don't you take their breakfast up and see if they'll tell you anything

02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:34.640
if any of us can get it out of the mucan?

02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:49.640
Who's that?

02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:52.640
It's only me. I've brought you both a nice breakfast.

02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:13.640
Well, what did they say?

02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:16.640
It seems that the groke is after the suitcase.

02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:17.640
Not them.

02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:21.640
I wonder what's in it, perhaps they've stolen her mummy as well.

02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:25.640
And they also said that it did use to belong to her.

02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:28.640
Oh, dear, if they've stolen it.

02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:30.640
I don't know about that.

02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:34.640
I asked them how they got it, but they wouldn't say another word.

02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:35.640
Well, this is too much.

02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:37.640
We could be harboring criminals.

02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:41.640
I know they don't look like it, but you never know, do you?

02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:43.640
You can ask the groke.

02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:45.640
Shh, don't shout.

02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:50.640
No, that's no good. We don't want to come back here most definitely.

02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:53.640
Let's ask the police inspector to question them.

02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:55.640
We don't want to get the police involved.

02:25:55.640 --> 02:25:57.640
Well, you'll suggest something, Anne.

02:25:57.640 --> 02:25:59.640
Quit shouting, sniff.

02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:06.640
Look, why don't you just wait for them to tell you a moment?

02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:11.640
I know it seems strange, but I've noticed that if you pretend not to be interested,

02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:13.640
people can't wait to tell you their secrets.

02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:17.640
They told Mama about the suitcase, but they wouldn't say anything to Papa.

02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:19.640
You know something, Moomin?

02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:21.640
They might open up to Snark Maiden.

02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:23.640
She's someone more their own age.

02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:25.640
You could be right.

02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:31.640
Hey, Snark Maiden.

02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:32.640
Where are you going?

02:26:32.640 --> 02:26:34.640
Moomin house.

02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:35.640
I'll come with you.

02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:38.640
But I thought you were living there.

02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:40.640
I was until Mumble came back yesterday.

02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:42.640
How is she?

02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:45.640
She's not bossy, and she snores too.

02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:47.640
Moomin.

02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:48.640
Snark Maiden.

02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:50.640
Where are you off to?

02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:52.640
Well, I was just on my way to see you.

02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:56.640
Oh, that's so nice, and I've come to see you, Moomin.

02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:59.640
I brought you a little present, Moomin.

02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:01.640
A present for me.

02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:03.640
Yes, and it's very beautiful.

02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:04.640
What is it?

02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:06.640
Something you must never break or lose.

02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:08.640
I promise I won't.

02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:09.640
There you are.

02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:10.640
Thank you.

02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:12.640
Come on, open it.

02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:19.640
A lot of beautiful shell.

02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:23.640
I spent all of yesterday on the beach searching for it just for you.

02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:25.640
Look, we can see ourselves in it.

02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:26.640
So we can.

02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:28.640
Thank you very much, Snark Maiden.

02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:31.640
It's my heart, and I want you to look after her.

02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:33.640
Oh, I will, Snark Maiden.

02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:34.640
I will.

02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:36.640
I'll think of you whenever I look at it.

02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:37.640
I'm Moomin.

02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:43.640
I promise you that I'll always kiss the shell before I go to sleep.

02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:46.640
It will be my most precious treasure.

02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:49.640
Apart from me?

02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:51.640
So what shall I do?

02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:53.640
Take them for a walk?

02:27:53.640 --> 02:27:56.640
Yes, but take your time and don't rush them.

02:27:56.640 --> 02:27:58.640
I'll let them cry on my shoulder.

02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:00.640
Yes, and try and talk to them as well, though.

02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:04.640
I feel very important and a little bit nervous, too.

02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:06.640
Have some tea first.

02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:09.640
Thank you, Moomin, Mama.

02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:21.640
We don't need your help, little Mai.

02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:22.640
Ah, that's what you think.

02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:24.640
I'd be able to weedle out their secrets.

02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:26.640
It's not an interrogation.

02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:28.640
We only want to talk to them, you know.

02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:30.640
So you can weedle out their secrets.

02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:31.640
I'll be very quiet.

02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:35.640
Little Mai, have you ever managed to be very quiet?

02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:38.640
Not really, but there's only one way to find out.

02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:40.640
You must let me go with Snork Maiden.

02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:45.640
No, this situation needs a tender understanding, Moomin.

02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:48.640
That's me, exactly.

02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:49.640
You ready?

02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:51.640
I suppose so.

02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:52.640
Hello, it's Moomin.

02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:56.640
Can I talk to you for a minute?

02:28:56.640 --> 02:28:59.640
Hello?

02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:01.640
This is Snork Maiden.

02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:03.640
She's a very good friend of mine.

02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:06.640
Hello, I'm very happy to meet you both.

02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:08.640
She's very tender and understanding,

02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:10.640
and she'd like to talk to you.

02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:13.640
Can she come in?

02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:18.640
Well, if she has to, Moomin.

02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:22.640
Come in, Mai.

02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:27.640
You pee, you pee, you pee.

02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:31.640
It's very beautiful, a perfect heart shape.

02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:34.640
I've never seen anything like it, Moomin.

02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:36.640
Would you like one, Mama?

02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:37.640
No, my dear.

02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:39.640
There should only be one shell like this.

02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:42.640
Then would you keep it somewhere safe for me?

02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:51.640
Well, Snork Maiden.

02:29:51.640 --> 02:29:54.640
I'm sure Snork Maiden will get it out of him.

02:29:54.640 --> 02:29:55.640
I do hope so.

02:29:55.640 --> 02:29:58.640
I think they like it anyway.

02:29:58.640 --> 02:30:02.640
I have a feeling in my bones that Groke will be back tonight.

02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:06.640
If we could find out why she's after them, we'd know what to do.

02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:11.640
Mama won't have any garden left if that monster comes back every night.

02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:14.640
Moomin.

02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:24.640
Well done, Snork Maiden.

02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:28.640
Little Mai.

02:30:31.640 --> 02:30:35.640
Oh no, she'll ruin everything if we don't stop her.

02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:42.640
If you interfere, little Mai, I'll never forgive you.

02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:45.640
What, interfere? Me? Never.

02:30:45.640 --> 02:30:48.640
Look, let's just leave it up to Snork Maiden now, little Mai.

02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:52.640
You'll need me if Snork Maiden's not tender and understanding enough.

02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:55.640
Hey, Moomin.

02:30:55.640 --> 02:30:59.640
So, how is Snork Maiden getting on her, taking them for a stroll?

02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:02.640
Where are they?

02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:11.640
If we were narrow.

02:31:11.640 --> 02:31:13.640
Papa, if we get much closer.

02:31:13.640 --> 02:31:17.640
And the last thing we want is for them to see us.

02:31:17.640 --> 02:31:20.640
Looks like I'll have to go and talk to them. You're all too big.

02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:22.640
I'll come back later and tell you what they said.

02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:25.640
No, don't. You'll upset Snork Maiden.

02:31:25.640 --> 02:31:27.640
You're the one who's upsetting her.

02:31:27.640 --> 02:31:29.640
Shh.

02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:33.640
All right. Can I ask you again about the suitcase?

02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:34.640
Yes.

02:31:34.640 --> 02:31:37.640
Does that suitcase belong to you or is it the Groakes?

02:31:37.640 --> 02:31:39.640
No.

02:31:41.640 --> 02:31:45.640
Let's try it another way. Who's is that suitcase?

02:31:45.640 --> 02:31:48.640
It's ours, it's ours.

02:31:48.640 --> 02:31:53.640
But you told Moomin Mama that it wasn't yours. It was the Groakes.

02:31:53.640 --> 02:31:55.640
Yes, we did.

02:31:55.640 --> 02:31:57.640
Oh.

02:31:57.640 --> 02:32:01.640
Do you mind if I ask you one more time?

02:32:01.640 --> 02:32:03.640
Please do.

02:32:03.640 --> 02:32:05.640
Right. Here we go.

02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:08.640
Now, all I want is a simple yes or no.

02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:10.640
Is that suitcase yours or not?

02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:12.640
No, yes.

02:32:12.640 --> 02:32:14.640
Oh.

02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:16.640
Take your time, Snork Maiden.

02:32:16.640 --> 02:32:18.640
Don't rush them, he said.

02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:20.640
What was that Snork Maiden?

02:32:20.640 --> 02:32:24.640
Look, I'm sorry, but can I ask you again?

02:32:24.640 --> 02:32:26.640
Yes, as many times as you want.

02:32:26.640 --> 02:32:29.640
Thank you. This is the very last time.

02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:31.640
So please tell me the truth.

02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:36.640
Now then, the suitcase.

02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:37.640
Yes.

02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:38.640
You know which one?

02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:39.640
Yes.

02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:41.640
Does it belong to you?

02:32:41.640 --> 02:32:42.640
Yes, it does.

02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:44.640
So it's not the Groakes.

02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:45.640
Yes, it is not the Groakes.

02:32:45.640 --> 02:32:49.640
At last, we're getting somewhere, praise the booble.

02:32:49.640 --> 02:32:52.640
We're very happy for you.

02:32:52.640 --> 02:32:55.640
Snork Maiden is really having to work hard.

02:32:55.640 --> 02:32:57.640
I wouldn't have, I'd scare them into talking.

02:32:57.640 --> 02:32:59.640
You should have let me go.

02:32:59.640 --> 02:33:01.640
Yeah, but we wanted someone gentle.

02:33:01.640 --> 02:33:03.640
Snork Maiden is nice.

02:33:03.640 --> 02:33:06.640
Everybody in this house is nice.

02:33:06.640 --> 02:33:09.640
Do you think they'd let us stay here forever?

02:33:09.640 --> 02:33:10.640
Of course.

02:33:10.640 --> 02:33:13.640
If we can keep away from the Groak.

02:33:15.640 --> 02:33:19.640
It took a long time, but in the end they trusted me, and now we're good friends.

02:33:19.640 --> 02:33:22.640
Who wouldn't trust you and want to be good friends?

02:33:22.640 --> 02:33:25.640
Thank you. It wasn't easy, though.

02:33:25.640 --> 02:33:28.640
They kept speaking together, and I got rather muddled.

02:33:28.640 --> 02:33:30.640
But they did tell me somehow.

02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:31.640
Rather muddled.

02:33:31.640 --> 02:33:33.640
I told you guys, you should have let me do it.

02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:36.640
Oh, I'm afraid I didn't get very much, though.

02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:38.640
I knew you wouldn't.

02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:42.640
So what did you find out then, Snork Maiden?

02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:43.640
Tell us.

02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:46.640
Well, first of all, the suitcase does seem to be theirs.

02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:48.640
That was one thing they made very clear.

02:33:48.640 --> 02:33:50.640
Then Hulk and the Groak, just a minute movement,

02:33:50.640 --> 02:33:54.640
what's in the suitcase on the other hand, belongs to the Groak.

02:33:54.640 --> 02:33:56.640
That's the problem.

02:33:56.640 --> 02:33:57.640
Oh, dear.

02:33:57.640 --> 02:34:00.640
So they do have something belonging to a...

02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:02.640
Well, Snork Maiden, what is it?

02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:04.640
They wouldn't tell me what it is, little Mai.

02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:08.640
Only that it is the most beautiful thing in the world.

02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:09.640
So, is it?

02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:11.640
I wonder.

02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:14.640
This is very difficult to understand.

02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:18.640
I mean, thingamy and Bob don't look like thieves at all, do they?

02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:21.640
So, the Groak just wanted back what is hers.

02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:26.640
I don't see how that big ugly monster could own the most beautiful thing in the world.

02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:29.640
Well, what they said was that she just happened to have it.

02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:32.640
They didn't say whether it belonged to her or not.

02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:34.640
So she might have stolen it herself.

02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:36.640
They shouldn't have taken it, though.

02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:38.640
Oh, dear, oh dear.

02:34:38.640 --> 02:34:43.640
Bob and Thingamy are very frightened of how she'll take her revenge if she catches them.

02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:47.640
But they're very determined to keep what's in the suitcase, Moomin Papa.

02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:50.640
Oh, this is a fine mess indeed.

02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:52.640
The Groak is sure to come back tonight.

02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:53.640
What can we do?

02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:55.640
What can we do?

02:34:55.640 --> 02:34:56.640
What can we do?

02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:58.640
We can do the same as before.

02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:00.640
Yeah, but it's not fair to drive her away.

02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:04.640
If what's in the suitcase really does belong to her?

02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:09.640
She means to get the suitcase and I don't think it will be so easy to get rid of her this time.

02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:13.640
And if she stays, we'll have a never-ending winter.

02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:16.640
Well, I'll cover up the petunias just in case.

02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:18.640
Are you all going to stay here?

02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:19.640
I'll look after Snork.

02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:21.640
I will, Moomin Mama, I'll stay.

02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:23.640
You'll stay, won't you, Snefkin?

02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:25.640
Don't look so clump, everyone.

02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:26.640
I've got an idea.

02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:29.640
But it would help if we knew what was in that suitcase.

02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:31.640
But even if we didn't, it could still work.

02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:33.640
What is it, dear?

02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:36.640
Just wait, Papa. You'll see.

02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:35.640
Oh!

02:36:47.640 --> 02:36:49.640
She's coming!

02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:50.640
Are we?

02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:52.640
She's out of her way!

02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:54.640
Oh, I hope Moomin Papa can do something.

02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:56.640
It's your girl, little mom.

02:36:56.640 --> 02:36:59.640
Yes, I know. There's the king and the queen.

02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:01.640
Uh, this one.

02:37:01.640 --> 02:37:03.640
Uh-oh, she's coming.

02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:05.640
Just when I was winning.

02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:08.640
You better hide under the table, little my.

02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:12.640
Don't be stupid. How can I hit her with my rolling pin from there?

02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:23.640
Where is she, Papa?

02:37:23.640 --> 02:37:25.640
Exactly where she was yesterday.

02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:27.640
I'll go for a toast, alright, Papa?

02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:32.640
Let me go first, and then the rest of you can fan out behind me.

02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:34.640
Moomin Mama.

02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:35.640
What is it, Papa?

02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:38.640
Perhaps now's the time to tell us your idea.

02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:40.640
We haven't long.

02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:55.640
Wait, Grog.

02:37:55.640 --> 02:37:58.640
Don't go away. We want to talk to you.

02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:04.640
We know that you've come back to get what thing of me and Bob took from you.

02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:07.640
That is right, isn't it, huh?

02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:12.640
Won't you let them keep it, perhaps?

02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:17.640
No, will you sell it to them?

02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:21.640
Oh, dear.

02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:25.640
I have some very beautiful things here in my bag.

02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:28.640
Maybe you'd like to trade, Grog.

02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:39.640
What about this pendant?

02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:41.640
Isn't it lovely?

02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:47.640
So you don't like that?

02:38:47.640 --> 02:38:49.640
What about this then?

02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:54.640
Or this?

02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:04.640
Alright, why don't you choose?

02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:08.640
Take anything you want from my handbag, except the hair slide.

02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:19.640
Which one do you want, this one?

02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:22.640
Let me see with this.

02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:26.640
Oh, this one?

02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:31.640
Oh, dear, that's not really mine to give to you.

02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:33.640
Snork maiden gave that to Moomin.

02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:36.640
Is it alright if I give the shell to her Moomin?

02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:40.640
Oh, you'll never allow.

02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:42.640
Are you alright?

02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:45.640
Yes, my hand was suddenly frozen.

02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:48.640
No, you've got the shell, Mrs. Grog.

02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:51.640
Do you promise not to come back anymore?

02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:57.640
Because I'll get you if you do.

02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:02.640
Oh, my God!

02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:14.640
Well, that was a close thing.

02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:16.640
I'm glad that's over.

02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:19.640
Oh, you are marvelous, Mama.

02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:23.640
I'm so sorry, Moomin.

02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:27.640
I forgot that I had put your precious shell in my handbag to keep it safe.

02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:29.640
It's alright, Mama.

02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:31.640
You gave it in a good cause.

02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:35.640
What Snork maiden gonna say, Moomin?

02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:37.640
I heard you.

02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:39.640
You said you'd never go to sleep without kissing it.

02:40:39.640 --> 02:40:41.640
Or something equally stupid.

02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:44.640
Well, I'm not gonna tell Snork maiden.

02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:47.640
But I think Mama did the right thing.

02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:49.640
She'll find out.

02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:51.640
I'm fed up with secrets.

02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:54.640
I'm always gonna tell the truth from now on, no matter what.

02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:05.640
Moomin, Moomin!

02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:07.640
Look, I found one.

02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:08.640
Really?

02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:11.640
Well, it's very similar.

02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:14.640
But the one Snork maiden gave me was much bigger.

02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:16.640
Oh, a lot bigger, was it?

02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:21.640
Moomin had decided that he had to find a shell that was exactly the same as the one Snork maiden had given him.

02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:25.640
Then with luck, she would never find out what he'd done with it.

02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:41.640
This is it!

02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:42.640
This is it!

02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:44.640
I killed it!

02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:49.640
It's exactly the same as the other one!

02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:52.640
Nothing short of a miracle, isn't it?

02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:55.640
But then in Moomin Valley, miracles do happen.

02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:04.640
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:11.640
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:16.640
They're always happy and always at play.

02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:20.640
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:23.640
The movements.

02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:27.640
The movements.

02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:34.640
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:40.640
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:45.640
They're always happy and always at play.

02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:49.640
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:52.640
The movements.

02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:56.640
The movements.

02:42:56.640 --> 02:43:02.640
The movements.

02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:17.640
The movements.

02:43:22.640 --> 02:43:25.640
Here they are for one and all.

02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:28.640
The movements are about to come.

02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:31.640
Come on and sit down here with me.

02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:36.640
There for you on your TV they are the movements.

02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:39.640
They are the movements.

02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:42.640
Don't come with me, give me your hand.

02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:45.640
I'll take you up to Moomin Land.

02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:48.640
You can fly just like a bird.

02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:50.640
Sing that song ever.

02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:53.640
There were the movements.

02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:56.640
There were the movements.

02:43:56.640 --> 02:43:59.640
There were the movements.

02:43:59.640 --> 02:44:02.640
There were the movements.

02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:05.640
There were the movements.

02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:08.640
There were the movements.

02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:38.640

02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:10.640
Oops!

02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:12.640
Oh, thank you, Mama.

02:45:12.640 --> 02:45:14.640
We weren't looking where we were going.

02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:16.640
That's all right.

02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:19.640
Here's your bag.

02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:20.640
Thank you, Thingamy.

02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:21.640
Are you going out?

02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:23.640
Yes, for a walk.

02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:24.640
We'll have fun.

02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:35.640
It seems that Thingamy and Bob are well and truly part of Movement House now.

02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:37.640
Luckily, they don't eat a lot.

02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:43.640
And they're small enough to find the pencils that fall between the floorboards in the porch.

02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:49.640
Hey, this looks like a great hiding place.

02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:51.640
Nobody would ever find it here.

02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:56.640
Come on, Bob. Let's go get the suitcase, man.

02:45:56.640 --> 02:45:58.640
Are you sure it's not safe for an alarm?

02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:03.640
What would you say if someone went in when we weren't there?

02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:05.640
You wouldn't like it, would you?

02:46:07.640 --> 02:46:11.640
I think the Moomons are much too nice to do anything like that.

02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:14.640
It's not them. It's the guests I'm thinking about.

02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:17.640
You know the Moomons let anybody stay.

02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:21.640
Snork Maiden.

02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:24.640
You lied to me, little Mai.

02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:25.640
Who me?

02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:28.640
Moomons still has the shell that I gave him.

02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:30.640
But you said that he didn't.

02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:31.640
And possible.

02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:33.640
Moom and Mama gave it to the croak.

02:46:33.640 --> 02:46:35.640
I was there when she did it.

02:46:35.640 --> 02:46:38.640
Look, I saw it. He showed it to me.

02:46:38.640 --> 02:46:40.640
Are you really sure? Was it the same one?

02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:43.640
Of course it was. I'm not stupid, you know.

02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:47.640
That's very odd. I saw her do it with my own eyes.

02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:50.640
Well, I'll go and ask Moomons right now, little Mai.

02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:54.640
It's a bit awkward. But if I'm going to be honest, Snork Maiden.

02:46:54.640 --> 02:47:00.640
What? Well, I've decided that from now on I'm only going to tell the truth.

02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:01.640
Oh, yes.

02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:03.640
And I found something you might be interested in.

02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:05.640
Well, what is it?

02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:07.640
Mungle and I were down on the beach yesterday.

02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:10.640
And you remember all those things we found washed up by the storm?

02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:14.640
Do you mean on the Hattie Fatter's island that we sailed to?

02:47:14.640 --> 02:47:18.640
Yes. And do you remember the figurehead that Moomon liked best of all?

02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:21.640
You know, the lady made of wood and painted.

02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:23.640
She was really lovely, wasn't she?

02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:25.640
Yes, I remember.

02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:26.640
Moomon wanted to keep it.

02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:28.640
So what about it?

02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:29.640
Well, it's here on the beach.

02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:31.640
It was still the same.

02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:34.640
As beautiful as ever.

02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:35.640
Was it the same one?

02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:37.640
Yes, I remember her pretty face.

02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:38.640
No legs, though.

02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:40.640
She's just a silly wooden doll.

02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:42.640
Oh, I know that.

02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:45.640
But she's got those gorgeous eyes in lovely long hair.

02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:49.640
Little Mai, why all this fuss about this silly figurehead?

02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:50.640
Trust him.

02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:53.640
Only someone as stupid as Moomon could fall in love with a figurehead.

02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:56.640
It's probably still dreaming about her every night.

02:47:56.640 --> 02:47:58.640
Do you think it's still there?

02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:01.640
Charles Nork Maiden, if no one else has found her already.

02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:05.640
Do you think the ocean might come and wash her away again?

02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:08.640
Why all these silly questions, Nork Maiden?

02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:11.640
Moomon would go and rescue her if he knew.

02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:12.640
So?

02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:13.640
That would be terrible.

02:48:13.640 --> 02:48:15.640
I couldn't bear it at all.

02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:16.640
I really couldn't.

02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:18.640
How pathetic.

02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:23.640
He'll probably take her home and keep her in his room forever.

02:48:23.640 --> 02:48:26.640
My expect she's too big to go through the door.

02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:30.640
He'll just sit and stare at her with that lovesick look on his face.

02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:31.640
I know he will.

02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:32.640
Oh!

02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:33.640
Where are you going now?

02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:35.640
I thought you were going to Moomon house.

02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:38.640
I was, but there's something more important I have to do.

02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:45.640
Okay, it's Chris.

02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:49.640
Hey, you two, you're not leaving, are you?

02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:51.640
No, we're just, uh, we're going.

02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:54.640
Why have you got the suitcase, then?

02:48:54.640 --> 02:48:57.640
Look, Moomon, would you help us with something?

02:48:57.640 --> 02:48:59.640
Of course.

02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:04.640
Thank you very much, Moomon.

02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:05.640
Oh, that's okay.

02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:08.640
It's a bit too big for you to go.

02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:10.640
I'm sorry.

02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:12.640
Thank you very much, Moomon.

02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:13.640
Oh, that's okay.

02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:15.640
It's a bit too big for you to carry.

02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:17.640
We can take it from here.

02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:18.640
It's all right.

02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:20.640
It's not very heavy.

02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:23.640
Oh, silly me.

02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:26.640
It wouldn't be a very secret place if I'd seen it.

02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:27.640
Would it?

02:49:27.640 --> 02:49:28.640
I'll see you later.

02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:29.640
Don't be too long now.

02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:31.640
How much you won't tell anyone, will you?

02:49:31.640 --> 02:49:33.640
Of course I won't.

02:49:33.640 --> 02:49:35.640
Oh, oh, oh.

02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:39.640
Hey, what are you doing up there, little my?

02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:40.640
I'm coming down.

02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:42.640
What does it look like?

02:49:42.640 --> 02:49:44.640
You're much too small to do, there.

02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:47.640
The rungs are too far apart for you to reach.

02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:48.640
Just you watch me.

02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:49.640
Oh.

02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:50.640
Oh.

02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:51.640
Oh.

02:49:51.640 --> 02:49:52.640
Oh.

02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:53.640
Oh.

02:49:53.640 --> 02:49:54.640
Oh.

02:49:54.640 --> 02:49:55.640
Oh.

02:49:55.640 --> 02:49:56.640
Oh.

02:49:56.640 --> 02:49:57.640
Oh.

02:49:57.640 --> 02:49:58.640
Oh.

02:49:58.640 --> 02:49:59.640
Oh.

02:49:59.640 --> 02:50:01.640
Hey, what are you doing up there, little my?

02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:03.640
Oh.

02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:05.640
Oh.

02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:11.640
Moonman, I have a problem.

02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:13.640
Do you mind if I ask you something?

02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:14.640
Go ahead.

02:50:14.640 --> 02:50:18.640
Did Moonman Mama give Snorkman's hard shape shell to the goat?

02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:20.640
Yes, she did.

02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:23.640
So you and the Groek can't both have it, can you?

02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:26.640
That's just where you're wrong.

02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:30.140
But that's simply impossible you can't have.

02:50:30.140 --> 02:50:32.940
The Groke's simply got another one.

02:50:32.940 --> 02:50:34.740
That's not true!

02:50:34.740 --> 02:50:38.340
All right, but it would only upset Snorke made an if she knew.

02:50:38.340 --> 02:50:40.140
So I'm not going to tell her.

02:50:40.140 --> 02:50:41.340
You rotten thing!

02:50:41.340 --> 02:50:43.340
Why don't you just tell me the truth?

02:50:43.340 --> 02:50:44.940
Because it's a secret.

02:50:44.940 --> 02:50:46.340
But I want to know, Moomin!

02:50:47.340 --> 02:50:48.340
Look, Moomin!

02:50:48.340 --> 02:50:52.340
Now, why don't you tell me your secret and then I'll tell you mine!

02:50:52.340 --> 02:50:53.340
What is it?

02:50:53.340 --> 02:50:55.140
Really very top secret.

02:50:55.140 --> 02:50:56.940
Go on then, tell me.

02:50:57.740 --> 02:50:59.140
Tell me yours first.

02:50:59.340 --> 02:51:01.340
No, you tell me first.

02:51:01.340 --> 02:51:03.540
I know, let's say them together.

02:51:03.540 --> 02:51:04.740
All right.

02:51:04.740 --> 02:51:06.140
Ready?

02:51:06.140 --> 02:51:07.940
One, two, three.

02:51:07.940 --> 02:51:10.140
After we go to the show and I went to the beach yesterday,

02:51:10.140 --> 02:51:11.140
I would like to be there.

02:51:11.140 --> 02:51:12.340
We'll find something that you like.

02:51:12.340 --> 02:51:14.340
Please, so I'll have a bigger head later.

02:51:14.340 --> 02:51:15.340
I just like it.

02:51:16.340 --> 02:51:17.340
What did you say?

02:51:17.340 --> 02:51:18.340
The figurehead?

02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:19.340
Yes, by the K.

02:51:20.740 --> 02:51:21.740
Wait a minute!

02:51:21.740 --> 02:51:23.740
You didn't finish telling me your secret!

02:51:23.740 --> 02:51:25.140
I'll tell you later!

02:51:25.140 --> 02:51:26.140
That's not there!

02:51:26.140 --> 02:51:28.140
You've got to tell me now!

02:51:30.140 --> 02:51:31.140
Oh!

02:51:51.140 --> 02:51:53.140
What do you think Moomin's doing?

02:51:53.140 --> 02:51:54.140
I don't know.

02:51:54.140 --> 02:51:56.140
Maybe he's looking for shells again.

02:51:57.140 --> 02:51:59.140
I don't think so.

02:51:59.140 --> 02:52:01.140
He looks a bit worried to me.

02:52:01.140 --> 02:52:04.140
Maybe he's lost something important.

02:52:08.140 --> 02:52:11.140
How much further do we have to go?

02:52:11.140 --> 02:52:13.140
As far as you can road.

02:52:13.140 --> 02:52:15.140
We're a long way out already, you know.

02:52:15.140 --> 02:52:18.140
I want to make sure that the lady will never turn up again.

02:52:18.140 --> 02:52:20.140
We must go further out.

02:52:20.140 --> 02:52:22.140
We must be far enough by now.

02:52:22.140 --> 02:52:23.140
I'm tired.

02:52:24.140 --> 02:52:25.140
No!

02:52:25.140 --> 02:52:27.140
The curds could still drag her in from here.

02:52:27.140 --> 02:52:28.140
Keep going!

02:52:38.140 --> 02:52:40.140
He looks very unhappy.

02:52:40.140 --> 02:52:41.140
We've got to cheer him up.

02:52:41.140 --> 02:52:42.140
But how?

02:52:42.140 --> 02:52:44.140
There's only one way, Bob.

02:52:44.140 --> 02:52:46.140
Yes, you're right, thing of me.

02:52:54.140 --> 02:52:56.140
Hello.

02:52:56.140 --> 02:52:58.140
You look so sad, Moomin.

02:52:58.140 --> 02:53:01.140
But we thought we'd try to make you happy again.

02:53:04.140 --> 02:53:06.140
You don't mind, do you?

02:53:06.140 --> 02:53:08.140
No, but you don't have to.

02:53:08.140 --> 02:53:10.140
I'm alright, really.

02:53:12.140 --> 02:53:14.140
How about this then, Moomin?

02:53:14.140 --> 02:53:16.140
We're going to show you what's in our suitcase.

02:53:16.140 --> 02:53:17.140
Go!

02:53:17.140 --> 02:53:18.140
Would you like that, Moomin?

02:53:18.140 --> 02:53:20.140
It's very interesting.

02:53:20.140 --> 02:53:22.140
Oh my gosh!

02:53:22.140 --> 02:53:24.140
Will you?

02:53:32.140 --> 02:53:34.140
Do you need some help in there?

02:53:34.140 --> 02:53:36.140
No, I think we can manage.

02:53:41.140 --> 02:53:43.140
Thank you, Moomin.

02:53:44.140 --> 02:53:45.140
Now we'll open it.

02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:46.140
Yes, now.

02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:48.140
One, two, three.

02:53:48.140 --> 02:53:50.140
Oh gosh!

02:53:50.140 --> 02:53:52.140
By my tail.

02:53:54.140 --> 02:53:55.140
Do you like it?

02:53:55.140 --> 02:53:57.140
Oh boy, do I like it?

02:53:57.140 --> 02:53:59.140
Then you're not sad anymore, Moomin.

02:53:59.140 --> 02:54:00.140
Oh no!

02:54:00.140 --> 02:54:02.140
That's good, isn't it?

02:54:02.140 --> 02:54:04.140
Yes, very good.

02:54:08.140 --> 02:54:11.140
It was such a beautiful ruby.

02:54:11.140 --> 02:54:15.140
How it changed color from soft red to soft red blue

02:54:15.140 --> 02:54:16.140
and then to pink?

02:54:16.140 --> 02:54:19.140
One minute, it was like a flame leaping out of the center.

02:54:19.140 --> 02:54:21.140
Then suddenly it was like a blood tulip.

02:54:21.140 --> 02:54:22.140
It was...

02:54:22.140 --> 02:54:25.140
Hmm, perhaps that's the king's ruby.

02:54:25.140 --> 02:54:28.140
It was just beautiful.

02:54:28.140 --> 02:54:30.140
That's the one the hob goblin is searching for.

02:54:30.140 --> 02:54:32.140
Oh, no.

02:54:32.140 --> 02:54:36.140
However far away he is, he'll come back on his black panther, looking for it.

02:54:36.140 --> 02:54:38.140
And he's sure to find it.

02:54:38.140 --> 02:54:41.140
Because he'll know that thing of me and Bob have it.

02:54:41.140 --> 02:54:43.140
First the Groke and now the hob goblin.

02:54:43.140 --> 02:54:45.140
What are we going to do?

02:54:49.140 --> 02:54:51.140
No more than a week later,

02:54:51.140 --> 02:54:53.140
and like a bolt from the blue,

02:54:53.140 --> 02:54:56.140
a real catastrophe hit Moomin Valley.

02:55:00.140 --> 02:55:02.140
Hmm.

02:55:02.140 --> 02:55:04.140
No, it's not in the bedroom either.

02:55:04.140 --> 02:55:06.140
Oh, that's very odd.

02:55:06.140 --> 02:55:08.140
Where did you see it last?

02:55:08.140 --> 02:55:10.140
I'm sure it was here somewhere, Papa.

02:55:10.140 --> 02:55:13.140
Well, perhaps it's in the garden.

02:55:15.140 --> 02:55:18.140
No, I haven't been out here all day.

02:55:19.140 --> 02:55:21.140
Moomin Mama's handbag is missing.

02:55:21.140 --> 02:55:25.140
Full of useful things like socks and sweets and string.

02:55:29.140 --> 02:55:30.140
What's the matter, Mama?

02:55:30.140 --> 02:55:33.140
I can't find my handbag and I'm lost without it.

02:55:33.140 --> 02:55:34.140
We've looked everywhere.

02:55:34.140 --> 02:55:37.140
Will I get a reward if I find it, Moomin Mama?

02:55:37.140 --> 02:55:40.140
Yes, we'll have a big party for everyone

02:55:40.140 --> 02:55:42.140
with cakes, jelly, and everything.

02:55:42.140 --> 02:55:46.140
And as a special treat, no one has to wash or go to bed early.

02:55:47.140 --> 02:55:48.140
I'll find it, Mama.

02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:49.140
No, I will.

02:55:56.140 --> 02:55:58.140
Moomin Mama, I've checked the cellar.

02:55:58.140 --> 02:55:59.140
It's not there.

02:55:59.140 --> 02:56:01.140
Oh, dear, where could it be?

02:56:01.140 --> 02:56:03.140
I haven't been in the cellar for days,

02:56:03.140 --> 02:56:05.140
so I didn't think it would be there,

02:56:05.140 --> 02:56:07.140
but thank you, dear Snork.

02:56:16.140 --> 02:56:19.140
Word got round Moomin Valley of the missing handbag,

02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:22.140
and soon everyone was helping to look for it.

02:56:25.140 --> 02:56:27.140
What a lot of people.

02:56:27.140 --> 02:56:29.140
I wonder what they're looking for.

02:56:38.140 --> 02:56:40.140
What's everybody looking for?

02:56:40.140 --> 02:56:42.140
My handbag, thingamy.

02:56:42.140 --> 02:56:45.140
The one with the two nice little pockets?

02:56:45.140 --> 02:56:46.140
Yes, that's the one.

02:56:46.140 --> 02:56:48.140
It's been missing for days.

02:56:48.140 --> 02:56:50.140
Will you two help us look?

02:56:53.140 --> 02:56:57.140
It makes such a lovely place to sleep, and don't you think?

02:57:00.140 --> 02:57:02.140
Moomin Mama looks very sad.

02:57:02.140 --> 02:57:04.140
Perhaps we better give it back.

02:57:16.140 --> 02:57:17.140
Oh.

02:57:21.140 --> 02:57:24.140
Oh, you found it.

02:57:25.140 --> 02:57:28.140
Look, everybody, thingamy and Bob have found it.

02:57:34.140 --> 02:57:36.140
Oh, thank you.

02:57:36.140 --> 02:57:38.140
Where on earth did you find it?

02:57:38.140 --> 02:57:40.140
In the bush under the white birch tree.

02:57:40.140 --> 02:57:43.140
It's a very, very nice handbag.

02:57:43.140 --> 02:57:48.140
Let's have a party tonight to celebrate the return of Mama's handbag.

02:57:50.140 --> 02:57:54.140
As you all know, this party is in honor of thingamy and Bob,

02:57:54.140 --> 02:57:56.140
finding Moomin Mama's handbag,

02:57:56.140 --> 02:57:59.140
and to thank everyone who took part in the big search.

02:58:00.140 --> 02:58:02.140
Let's raise our glasses to our heroes.

02:58:02.140 --> 02:58:04.140
Is to thingamy and Bob,

02:58:04.140 --> 02:58:07.140
who found Moomin Mama's handbag without which Moomin Valley

02:58:07.140 --> 02:58:09.140
would never be the same again.

02:58:10.140 --> 02:58:11.140
Cheers.

02:58:14.140 --> 02:58:17.140
Now, I think Moomin would like to say a few words.

02:58:17.140 --> 02:58:18.140
Moomin.

02:58:18.140 --> 02:58:22.140
We're very pleased that Mama's handbag is back again.

02:58:22.140 --> 02:58:25.140
And thank you to our northern friends, Thingamy and Bob.

02:58:25.140 --> 02:58:28.140
You're seeing as how this is a very special occasion,

02:58:28.140 --> 02:58:31.140
and also as a thank you for the party they have decided to show us

02:58:31.140 --> 02:58:33.140
what is in their suitcase,

02:58:33.140 --> 02:58:36.140
and I'm sure you'll all be astounded by what you see.

02:58:36.140 --> 02:58:38.140
Come closer, everyone.

02:58:38.140 --> 02:58:41.140
Now, thingamy and Bob, are you ready?

02:58:45.140 --> 02:58:47.140
Ready, everyone?

02:58:47.140 --> 02:58:48.140
Ready, everyone?

02:58:48.140 --> 02:58:50.140
One, two, three!

02:58:50.140 --> 02:58:52.140
Ooh!

02:58:54.140 --> 02:58:56.140
How wonderful!

02:58:56.140 --> 02:59:00.140
I don't know how the globe could swap that for an old seashell.

02:59:00.140 --> 02:59:05.140
Oh, I don't know how the globe could swap that for an old seashell.

02:59:07.140 --> 02:59:11.140
By my, that must be the King's Ruby.

02:59:26.140 --> 02:59:29.140
The King's Ruby. I found it.

02:59:29.140 --> 02:59:31.140
It's the Hub Goblin!

02:59:35.140 --> 02:59:38.140
Yes, this is it. The ruby I've sworn to find.

02:59:40.140 --> 02:59:42.140
Don't touch it! It's ours!

02:59:42.140 --> 02:59:44.140
Go away, you nasty Hub Goblin!

02:59:44.140 --> 02:59:47.140
But that King's ruby belongs only to me!

02:59:47.140 --> 02:59:54.140
No, it doesn't. The Groke gave it to sing-a-me-in-bob-in-fair exchange for a heart-shaped shell, Mr. Hub Goblin.

02:59:54.140 --> 02:59:57.140
Did he say a heart-shaped shell?

02:59:57.140 --> 02:59:59.140
I think so.

02:59:59.140 --> 03:00:02.140
Anyway, I saw her give it to them with my own eyes.

03:00:02.140 --> 03:00:04.140
Show it belongs to them, not you.

03:00:04.140 --> 03:00:10.140
I've spent 300 years day and night searching everywhere for this ruby.

03:00:10.140 --> 03:00:13.140
Well, that's very sad, but it still is.

03:00:13.140 --> 03:00:19.140
Now then, let's see, would you exchange the ruby for, say, two diamond mines?

03:00:19.140 --> 03:00:22.140
No! We don't mind anything else!

03:00:28.140 --> 03:00:32.140
No, I can't do it. I can't take it by force.

03:00:34.140 --> 03:00:37.140
It's been so long. What can I do?

03:00:48.140 --> 03:00:52.140
Would you like some punch? It's very nice.

03:00:53.140 --> 03:00:58.140
That's very kind of you, woman, mama. I haven't had any for 85 years.

03:01:05.140 --> 03:01:07.140
Ah, quince.

03:01:07.140 --> 03:01:11.140
That's part of it, Mr. Hub Goblin. Have some more, please.

03:01:11.140 --> 03:01:14.140
No, thank you. Hub Goblins don't really drink very much.

03:01:14.140 --> 03:01:18.140
Well, this is a splendid punch and a splendid party.

03:01:18.140 --> 03:01:21.140
In return, I shall show you a little magic.

03:01:21.140 --> 03:01:24.140
I will give out three presents.

03:01:24.140 --> 03:01:30.140
Now what I can do is grant three wishes, so I want three of you to come forward and make a wish.

03:01:30.140 --> 03:01:34.140
You're not afraid, are you?

03:01:34.140 --> 03:01:39.140
How you look old enough not to be frightened, Mr. Emulane?

03:01:39.140 --> 03:01:41.140
Just let me think.

03:01:41.140 --> 03:01:46.140
Oh, yes, Mr. Hub Goblin. I broke the spade. I borrowed from woman, papa.

03:01:47.140 --> 03:01:50.140
No, Mr. Emulane, never make a proper wish.

03:01:50.140 --> 03:01:53.140
I would like a new spade, if you please.

03:01:53.140 --> 03:01:55.140
Very well. Here you are.

03:01:55.140 --> 03:02:00.140
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Hub Goblin.

03:02:00.140 --> 03:02:02.140
Here you are, woman, papa.

03:02:02.140 --> 03:02:04.140
Right. Who's next?

03:02:04.140 --> 03:02:06.140
Excuse me?

03:02:08.140 --> 03:02:11.140
Yes, and what can I do for you, young lady?

03:02:11.140 --> 03:02:14.140
Well, I'm afraid it might be a little difficult.

03:02:14.140 --> 03:02:17.140
Huh, for me?

03:02:17.140 --> 03:02:19.140
Is that really what you want?

03:02:19.140 --> 03:02:20.140
Please.

03:02:20.140 --> 03:02:23.140
All right, then close your eyes.

03:02:23.140 --> 03:02:28.140
Your wish has now come true, young lady.

03:02:28.140 --> 03:02:29.140
Oh.

03:02:29.140 --> 03:02:31.140
Oh, snorke-may.

03:02:31.140 --> 03:02:33.140
Oh, snorke-may done.

03:02:33.140 --> 03:02:37.140
I've wanted eyes like that wouldn't lay to you think it's so beautiful.

03:02:37.140 --> 03:02:40.140
Do you think I'm beautiful now, woman?

03:02:40.140 --> 03:02:44.140
Well, I, well, give me a mirror, someone.

03:02:44.140 --> 03:02:47.140
They're quite nice, really.

03:02:51.140 --> 03:02:53.140
Huh?

03:02:53.140 --> 03:02:57.140
This is horrible, horrible.

03:02:57.140 --> 03:03:01.140
Please, Mr. Hub Goblin, please give me my eyes back.

03:03:01.140 --> 03:03:05.140
I'm sorry, but I can only grant one wish per person.

03:03:05.140 --> 03:03:09.140
Oh, that's really me. No, please.

03:03:09.140 --> 03:03:13.140
Mr. Hub Goblin, can I make a wish now?

03:03:13.140 --> 03:03:18.140
Certainly. A golden chariot. A rock crystal goblet. Anything at all.

03:03:18.140 --> 03:03:22.140
A sack full of gold coins. You can be rich, woman. Really rich.

03:03:22.140 --> 03:03:25.140
I'm sorry, but movements is the last wish.

03:03:25.140 --> 03:03:28.140
I know. Why don't you ask for two sackfuls of gold, woman?

03:03:28.140 --> 03:03:31.140
Then we can have one each. What do you think?

03:03:31.140 --> 03:03:34.140
No, sniff. I know what I'm going to wish.

03:03:34.140 --> 03:03:35.140
Oh, man.

03:03:35.140 --> 03:03:38.140
Mr. Hub Goblin, please change snorke-may done's eyes back to her own.

03:03:38.140 --> 03:03:43.140
Never mind her, she can see all right. Get the gold coins.

03:03:43.140 --> 03:03:47.140
The wish is made and fulfilled.

03:03:49.140 --> 03:03:51.140
There you are. Have a look.

03:03:51.140 --> 03:03:52.140
Oh.

03:03:52.140 --> 03:03:56.140
The next time. Think before you make a wish.

03:03:56.140 --> 03:03:58.140
Momen.

03:04:00.140 --> 03:04:02.140
Mr. Hub Goblin.

03:04:02.140 --> 03:04:04.140
Yes, think of me.

03:04:04.140 --> 03:04:06.140
If you can grant wishes like that,

03:04:06.140 --> 03:04:09.140
why don't you make a wish for yourself?

03:04:09.140 --> 03:04:12.140
I'm afraid my magic only works for other people.

03:04:12.140 --> 03:04:16.140
Mr. Hub Goblin, can we make a wish for you then? Please, there we can.

03:04:16.140 --> 03:04:17.140
Please.

03:04:17.140 --> 03:04:18.140
I suppose so.

03:04:18.140 --> 03:04:20.140
Oh, please. It's important.

03:04:20.140 --> 03:04:23.140
Very well, as it is not for you.

03:04:23.140 --> 03:04:26.140
We wish for a movie just like yours.

03:04:26.140 --> 03:04:28.140
You shall have it.

03:04:29.140 --> 03:04:31.140
This is for you, Hub Goblin.

03:04:31.140 --> 03:04:34.140
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

03:04:34.140 --> 03:04:40.140
And so that was how, after three hundred years, the Hub Goblin search came to an end.

03:04:40.140 --> 03:04:45.140
And Momen Valley had never had such a celebration.

03:04:45.140 --> 03:04:47.140
Oh, thank you.

03:04:47.140 --> 03:04:48.140
Thank you.

03:04:48.140 --> 03:04:53.140
And so that was how, after three hundred years,

03:04:53.140 --> 03:04:59.460
Goblin's search came to an end, and Moomin Valley had never had such a celebration.

03:04:59.460 --> 03:05:06.460
Everyone was happy, except possibly Sniff, who would have quite liked a sack full of gold coins.

03:05:23.140 --> 03:05:31.140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

03:05:31.140 --> 03:05:35.140
They're always happy and always at play.

03:05:35.140 --> 03:05:42.140
The Moomin's are having fun day after day. The Moomin's.

03:05:42.140 --> 03:05:46.140
The Moomin's.

03:05:46.140 --> 03:05:53.140
They love the laughter and they love the living the Moomin's.

03:05:53.140 --> 03:06:01.140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

03:06:01.140 --> 03:06:04.140
They're always happy and always at play.

03:06:04.140 --> 03:06:11.140
The Moomin's are having fun day after day. The Moomin's.

03:06:11.140 --> 03:06:18.140
The Moomin's.

03:06:18.140 --> 03:06:21.140
The Moomin's.

03:06:41.140 --> 03:06:46.140
They are for one and all. The Moomin's are about to call.

03:06:46.140 --> 03:06:54.140
Come on and sit down here with me. Therefore you are your TV. They are the Moomin's.

03:06:54.140 --> 03:06:57.140
They are the Moomin's.

03:06:57.140 --> 03:07:03.140
So come with me, give me your hand. I'll take you up to a Moomin land.

03:07:03.140 --> 03:07:11.140
You can fly just like a bird. Sing that song ever. There were the Moomin's.

03:07:11.140 --> 03:07:14.140
There were the Moomin's.

03:07:14.140 --> 03:07:17.140
There were the Moomin's.

03:07:17.140 --> 03:07:20.140
There were the Moomin's.

03:07:20.140 --> 03:07:23.140
There were the Moomin's.

03:07:23.140 --> 03:07:26.140
There were the Moomin's.

03:07:33.140 --> 03:07:38.140
There were the Moomin's.

03:07:38.140 --> 03:07:43.140
There were the Moomin's.

03:07:43.140 --> 03:07:48.140
There were the Moomin's.

03:07:48.140 --> 03:07:53.140
There were the Moomin's.

03:07:53.140 --> 03:07:59.140
There were the Moomin's.

03:07:59.140 --> 03:08:09.140
There were the Moomin's.

03:08:09.140 --> 03:08:15.140
There were the Moomin's.

03:08:15.140 --> 03:08:24.140
There were the Moomin's.

03:08:24.140 --> 03:08:28.140
Come on, man. We're here already. This is Mum and House.

03:08:31.140 --> 03:08:33.140
It has been raining since lunchtime,

03:08:33.140 --> 03:08:37.140
and Mum and his friends had spent all afternoon in Mum and House,

03:08:37.140 --> 03:08:39.140
waiting for the Sunday to come out.

03:08:42.140 --> 03:08:46.140
So, Tutiki's arrival was very welcome.

03:08:47.140 --> 03:08:50.140
Good evening, Mum and Tutiki. Come here.

03:08:50.140 --> 03:08:51.140
Come in.

03:08:53.140 --> 03:08:55.140
Mum, don't take his hair.

03:08:55.140 --> 03:08:58.140
Come on in, Manny. A neat moment.

03:09:01.140 --> 03:09:03.140
Is there someone with you?

03:09:03.140 --> 03:09:05.140
Yes, I brought my friend, Manny.

03:09:05.140 --> 03:09:06.140
Manny?

03:09:06.140 --> 03:09:08.140
Don't be shy.

03:09:09.140 --> 03:09:11.140
Well, there's no one there.

03:09:11.140 --> 03:09:14.140
Yes, there is. You just can't see her.

03:09:14.140 --> 03:09:15.140
Really?

03:09:15.140 --> 03:09:18.140
Yes, I'm afraid she's very, very shy.

03:09:19.140 --> 03:09:23.140
I'll leave the door open for you, Manny. Come in when you're ready.

03:09:23.140 --> 03:09:26.140
She'll get soaked if she stays out there.

03:09:26.140 --> 03:09:30.140
Maybe that doesn't matter very much if you're invisible.

03:09:33.140 --> 03:09:36.140
Tutiki, how nice.

03:09:38.140 --> 03:09:41.140
What is everyone looking at?

03:09:42.140 --> 03:09:46.140
A bad Nanny.

03:09:46.140 --> 03:09:50.140
You know, sometimes when people are very frightened,

03:09:50.140 --> 03:09:53.140
they can become invisible to the people around them.

03:09:54.140 --> 03:09:55.140
Poor Nanny.

03:09:55.140 --> 03:09:58.140
She's looked after by an aunt who doesn't like her,

03:09:58.140 --> 03:10:00.140
and is really horrible to her,

03:10:00.140 --> 03:10:03.140
and who only does it because she thinks it's her duty.

03:10:03.140 --> 03:10:07.140
It wouldn't be so bad if she just got mad and yelled at her,

03:10:07.140 --> 03:10:10.140
but she's cold and sarcastic, which is much worse.

03:10:10.140 --> 03:10:13.140
She doesn't care if Nanny is unhappy,

03:10:13.140 --> 03:10:15.140
and gives her horrible jobs.

03:10:15.140 --> 03:10:17.140
What's sarcastic?

03:10:17.140 --> 03:10:19.140
Uh, let's see.

03:10:19.140 --> 03:10:21.140
Suppose you tripped and fell over.

03:10:21.140 --> 03:10:23.140
What would Mum and Mama say?

03:10:24.140 --> 03:10:26.140
Well, she'd ask me if I'd hurt myself.

03:10:26.140 --> 03:10:29.140
Yes, well, you're lucky that Mum and Mama is so nice,

03:10:29.140 --> 03:10:32.140
but a lot of people would be mad at you.

03:10:32.140 --> 03:10:34.140
Now, this nasty old lady would say

03:10:34.140 --> 03:10:36.140
that maybe you're right dear of dancing,

03:10:36.140 --> 03:10:39.140
but try not to do it when people are eaten, please.

03:10:39.140 --> 03:10:41.140
Gosh, that's horrible.

03:10:41.140 --> 03:10:45.140
Anyway, she just went on being more and more horrible to her,

03:10:45.140 --> 03:10:48.140
so that in the end, Nanny was so upset.

03:10:48.140 --> 03:10:50.140
She became invisible,

03:10:50.140 --> 03:10:52.140
and our aunt said she couldn't be bothered

03:10:52.140 --> 03:10:54.140
to look after little girl she couldn't see.

03:10:54.140 --> 03:10:56.140
Poor Nanny.

03:10:57.140 --> 03:10:59.140
So she asked me to do it.

03:10:59.140 --> 03:11:01.140
Nanny's still outside.

03:11:01.140 --> 03:11:03.140
Too nervous to come in.

03:11:05.140 --> 03:11:07.140
What did you do to this old aunt?

03:11:07.140 --> 03:11:10.140
I hope you told her she heard Nanny's feelings.

03:11:10.140 --> 03:11:13.140
She wouldn't have done any good, not with someone like her.

03:11:14.140 --> 03:11:16.140
So I took Nanny home,

03:11:16.140 --> 03:11:18.140
and then as you're the nicest family I know,

03:11:18.140 --> 03:11:21.140
I brought her here so you could make her visible again.

03:11:21.140 --> 03:11:24.140
You were very flattered, of course, too, Tiki, but...

03:11:24.140 --> 03:11:27.140
If anyone can do it, you and Mum and Mama can,

03:11:27.140 --> 03:11:29.140
and Mum can play with her.

03:11:29.140 --> 03:11:31.140
Does she talk at all to Tiki?

03:11:31.140 --> 03:11:32.140
I'm afraid not.

03:11:32.140 --> 03:11:34.140
Not since she became invisible.

03:11:34.140 --> 03:11:35.140
Oh, dear.

03:11:36.140 --> 03:11:38.140
I'm sure I can think of lots of games,

03:11:38.140 --> 03:11:41.140
but it'll be hard to play if I can't see her.

03:11:41.140 --> 03:11:43.140
She'll be really good at hiding seat, though.

03:11:43.140 --> 03:11:45.140
Oh, it's okay.

03:11:45.140 --> 03:11:49.140
You know where she is because her aunt hung a little bell around her neck.

03:11:54.140 --> 03:11:56.140
Oh, look, the door's opened.

03:11:56.140 --> 03:11:58.140
That'll be Nanny.

03:12:02.140 --> 03:12:04.140
Come in, Nanny.

03:12:04.140 --> 03:12:07.140
All right, don't be frightened.

03:12:07.140 --> 03:12:09.140
Come and meet everyone.

03:12:09.140 --> 03:12:11.140
This is your new home,

03:12:11.140 --> 03:12:14.140
and this is Mum and Mama and Mum and Papa.

03:12:14.140 --> 03:12:16.140
They're both very nice.

03:12:16.140 --> 03:12:19.140
Hello, I'm Mum and these are my friends.

03:12:22.140 --> 03:12:24.140
We were just having some tea.

03:12:24.140 --> 03:12:25.140
Would you like some?

03:12:25.140 --> 03:12:28.140
Oh, that is, if you can drink.

03:12:28.140 --> 03:12:32.140
Oh, perhaps I should make some lemonade.

03:12:33.140 --> 03:12:37.140
Well, now, perhaps you'd all like to go back to the table.

03:12:37.140 --> 03:12:40.140
If you'd care to sit down, Nanny.

03:12:44.140 --> 03:12:47.140
I'm sorry I don't know any more about her,

03:12:47.140 --> 03:12:50.140
but I'm sure that everything will be okay now she's here.

03:12:50.140 --> 03:12:53.140
I'm certain it will.

03:12:53.140 --> 03:12:55.140
We'll do our best, Tiki.

03:12:57.140 --> 03:12:59.140
Here you are, Nanny.

03:13:03.140 --> 03:13:07.140
Well, she seems to be okay now,

03:13:07.140 --> 03:13:09.140
so I'd better be getting along.

03:13:09.140 --> 03:13:11.140
I've got a lot of things to do.

03:13:11.140 --> 03:13:15.140
I'll try and come over to see how you're all going.

03:13:15.140 --> 03:13:18.140
That would really be nice.

03:13:20.140 --> 03:13:22.140
Oh, that's a better.

03:13:22.140 --> 03:13:24.140
You have got room, haven't you?

03:13:24.140 --> 03:13:27.140
Didn't you have someone else stand?

03:13:27.140 --> 03:13:32.140
Oh, yes, thing I mean Bob, but it's alright, they left last week.

03:13:32.140 --> 03:13:34.140
That's okay then.

03:13:38.140 --> 03:13:41.140
Oh, you must have been thirsty.

03:13:41.140 --> 03:13:44.140
Would you like some more?

03:13:44.140 --> 03:13:46.140
Sure.

03:13:58.140 --> 03:14:02.140
Oh, are you coming up with me?

03:14:02.140 --> 03:14:05.140
That's nice, Nanny.

03:14:13.140 --> 03:14:16.140
This is your very own room.

03:14:16.140 --> 03:14:20.140
You'll be warm and cozy here.

03:14:20.140 --> 03:14:22.140
I've put the lemonade on the table,

03:14:22.140 --> 03:14:26.140
so you can have a drink whenever you want.

03:14:26.140 --> 03:14:30.140
Are you sure you wouldn't like something to eat?

03:14:30.140 --> 03:14:33.140
Ah, I see, you want to go to bed.

03:14:33.140 --> 03:14:37.140
Well, you had a busy day, so you must be tired out.

03:14:37.140 --> 03:14:40.140
Don't forget, if you feel frightened or lonely during the night,

03:14:40.140 --> 03:14:43.140
just come and wake me up and we'll have a talk.

03:14:43.140 --> 03:14:46.140
If you like, you can tinkle your little bell in my ear,

03:14:46.140 --> 03:14:50.140
and that should do it, many dear.

03:14:50.140 --> 03:14:54.140
Sweet dreams, sleep well.

03:14:57.140 --> 03:14:59.140
She asleep?

03:14:59.140 --> 03:15:02.140
Yes.

03:15:02.140 --> 03:15:06.140
I was wondering whether there's anything that might help her

03:15:06.140 --> 03:15:09.140
in your granny's book of household remedies.

03:15:09.140 --> 03:15:12.140
I don't know if there's a cure for invisibility.

03:15:12.140 --> 03:15:14.140
I can't remember, but I'll have a look.

03:15:14.140 --> 03:15:16.140
There's a remedy for most things.

03:15:16.140 --> 03:15:18.140
I'm a phone believer in granny's remedy.

03:15:18.140 --> 03:15:20.140
I know you are dear.

03:15:20.140 --> 03:15:22.140
I'll go and see.

03:15:22.140 --> 03:15:25.140
I wonder what you looked like.

03:15:25.140 --> 03:15:28.140
Hmm.

03:15:28.140 --> 03:15:31.140
Hmm.

03:15:31.140 --> 03:15:34.140
Ah, there it is.

03:15:34.140 --> 03:15:39.140
Now then, a droopy tail, evil eye, melancholy.

03:15:39.140 --> 03:15:43.140
Ah, this must be it.

03:15:43.140 --> 03:15:46.140
Ah, this must be it.

03:15:58.140 --> 03:16:02.140
The prescription was at the end of the book and shakily written,

03:16:02.140 --> 03:16:04.140
but it looked like the right one.

03:16:04.140 --> 03:16:08.140
It said, remedy for when people start getting misty

03:16:08.140 --> 03:16:11.140
and difficult to see.

03:16:11.140 --> 03:16:14.140
It was very complicated.

03:16:29.140 --> 03:16:32.140
Do you think it's going to work, Mama?

03:16:32.140 --> 03:16:35.140
Granny's remedies usually do, so don't worry.

03:16:35.140 --> 03:16:37.140
Yes, you're right.

03:16:37.140 --> 03:16:40.140
I wonder whether we ought to go and wake her up.

03:16:57.140 --> 03:17:00.140
Look, you can see many shoes.

03:17:08.140 --> 03:17:11.140
Papa!

03:17:11.140 --> 03:17:13.140
Papa!

03:17:13.140 --> 03:17:15.140
Good morning, little Mai.

03:17:15.140 --> 03:17:17.140
Is Ninny up yet?

03:17:17.140 --> 03:17:19.140
Yes, she is.

03:17:19.140 --> 03:17:22.140
Where is she? She hasn't eaten yet, has she?

03:17:22.140 --> 03:17:25.140
I don't know, and she's probably at the dining room.

03:17:25.140 --> 03:17:28.140
Oh, no!

03:17:34.140 --> 03:17:36.140
I'm too late!

03:17:36.140 --> 03:17:39.140
She'd be quiet, you two.

03:17:39.140 --> 03:17:42.140
Ninny's just finishing her breakfast.

03:17:42.140 --> 03:17:45.140
Come on, drink it all up.

03:17:45.140 --> 03:17:48.140
That's good.

03:17:48.140 --> 03:17:50.140
It should start to work in a couple of hours.

03:17:50.140 --> 03:17:52.140
Well done, Ninny.

03:17:52.140 --> 03:17:54.140
Look, her shoes are floating!

03:17:54.140 --> 03:17:58.140
Yeah, and soon we'll be seeing the rest of her.

03:17:58.140 --> 03:18:00.140
Ha, they look silly.

03:18:00.140 --> 03:18:02.140
I think they're very nice feet.

03:18:02.140 --> 03:18:04.140
I know women, Mama's remedies are good,

03:18:04.140 --> 03:18:06.140
I can't see them working that fast.

03:18:06.140 --> 03:18:10.140
Anyway, you must look pretty bad if you want to make yourself invisible.

03:18:10.140 --> 03:18:12.140
Don't let little Mai upset you, Ninny.

03:18:12.140 --> 03:18:14.140
It's only the way she talks.

03:18:14.140 --> 03:18:16.140
She doesn't mean it.

03:18:16.140 --> 03:18:18.140
Oh, yes, I do.

03:18:18.140 --> 03:18:20.140
I'm bored, Moomin.

03:18:20.140 --> 03:18:22.140
Well, what shall we do then, Moomin?

03:18:22.140 --> 03:18:24.140
I don't know.

03:18:24.140 --> 03:18:26.140
Let's go mushroom picking.

03:18:26.140 --> 03:18:28.140
That's boring, I never find any.

03:18:28.140 --> 03:18:30.140
Well, I do.

03:18:30.140 --> 03:18:32.140
Would you like to come, Ninny?

03:18:32.140 --> 03:18:34.140
You can pick the most, shall we?

03:18:34.140 --> 03:18:36.140
They all look the same to me,

03:18:36.140 --> 03:18:40.140
so you'll have to tell me which ones are safe to eat.

03:18:42.140 --> 03:18:44.140
I'll tell you.

03:18:56.140 --> 03:18:58.140
Papa! Papa!

03:18:58.140 --> 03:19:01.140
Look, Papa, you can see many shoes now.

03:19:01.140 --> 03:19:05.140
Oh, that's good. There's not many things Mama's potions won't cure.

03:19:05.140 --> 03:19:07.140
Oh, it can't be that. She only took it a minute ago.

03:19:07.140 --> 03:19:11.140
Well, it might be that it works faster if you're completely invisible.

03:19:11.140 --> 03:19:13.140
I think it's being away from that horrid out.

03:19:13.140 --> 03:19:15.140
Yes, it could be.

03:19:15.140 --> 03:19:19.140
Mama, we're taking Ninny mushroom picking.

03:19:19.140 --> 03:19:21.140
Have a nice time.

03:19:21.140 --> 03:19:23.140
Morning!

03:19:23.140 --> 03:19:25.140
Morning!

03:19:25.140 --> 03:19:27.140
Hello.

03:19:27.140 --> 03:19:29.140
Where's Ninny?

03:19:31.140 --> 03:19:33.140
Ah!

03:19:33.140 --> 03:19:35.140
Ah!

03:19:35.140 --> 03:19:37.140
Ah!

03:19:37.140 --> 03:19:39.140
Ah!

03:19:39.140 --> 03:19:41.140
Wow, what a lot of mushrooms!

03:19:41.140 --> 03:19:43.140
Ah!

03:19:43.140 --> 03:19:45.140
Ah!

03:19:45.140 --> 03:19:47.140
Ah!

03:19:47.140 --> 03:19:49.140
Ah!

03:19:49.140 --> 03:19:51.140
Ah!

03:19:51.140 --> 03:19:53.140
Ah!

03:19:53.140 --> 03:19:57.140
Wow, what a lot of mushrooms!

03:19:57.140 --> 03:20:07.140
You seem to know where to find all the best ones, Ninny.

03:20:07.140 --> 03:20:11.140
It's so fair. I haven't gotten half as many.

03:20:11.140 --> 03:20:13.140
How are you doing, Momen?

03:20:13.140 --> 03:20:15.140
Ah!

03:20:15.140 --> 03:20:19.140
Wow, that must be about four times as many as I've got.

03:20:19.140 --> 03:20:21.140
Uh, yeah, that's right.

03:20:21.140 --> 03:20:25.140
You've never picked that many before.

03:20:25.140 --> 03:20:29.140
You know, Momen, I think there's something fishy about this.

03:20:31.140 --> 03:20:34.140
Uh-huh, so they're not yours at all.

03:20:34.140 --> 03:20:37.140
Well, not really, no.

03:20:37.140 --> 03:20:40.140
Ninny's enjoyed herself.

03:20:40.140 --> 03:20:43.140
I'd better yak you old ant never let her go mushroom picking.

03:20:43.140 --> 03:20:47.140
She was probably only allowed to carry the baskets, the really heavy ones.

03:20:47.140 --> 03:20:51.140
Oh, how awful for her.

03:20:51.140 --> 03:20:55.140
They're stinky.

03:20:55.140 --> 03:20:57.140
What's he up to now?

03:20:57.140 --> 03:20:59.140
I'll take care of him.

03:20:59.140 --> 03:21:01.140
Hello, Momen, long time no see.

03:21:01.140 --> 03:21:03.140
Not long enough.

03:21:03.140 --> 03:21:05.140
Last time you dipped my swimming shorts in glue.

03:21:05.140 --> 03:21:08.140
You know, I thought that was very funny.

03:21:08.140 --> 03:21:11.140
Hey, what's that basket floating around up there for?

03:21:11.140 --> 03:21:14.140
I don't want to be rude, but mind your own business.

03:21:14.140 --> 03:21:16.140
It looks like the Hobgoblins work.

03:21:16.140 --> 03:21:19.140
Boy, just think of all the things you could do if you were invisible.

03:21:20.140 --> 03:21:22.140
Ninny, I'll carry your basket.

03:21:22.140 --> 03:21:23.140
Let's go.

03:21:23.140 --> 03:21:26.140
It stinks here.

03:21:26.140 --> 03:21:28.140
Hey, you.

03:21:28.140 --> 03:21:30.140
Isn't it me a name or just a description?

03:21:30.140 --> 03:21:31.140
What's wrong?

03:21:31.140 --> 03:21:33.140
Is your voice invisible, too?

03:21:33.140 --> 03:21:35.140
Please stop it, stinky.

03:21:35.140 --> 03:21:37.140
Can't you see you're frightening her?

03:21:37.140 --> 03:21:39.140
Oh, it's a girl, is it?

03:21:39.140 --> 03:21:40.140
Why doesn't she speak for herself?

03:21:40.140 --> 03:21:41.140
And she's stupid.

03:21:41.140 --> 03:21:44.140
What a perfect name for her, Ninny.

03:21:44.140 --> 03:21:46.140
Now look, stinky.

03:21:46.140 --> 03:21:48.140
Oh, yes, Momen, now look what?

03:21:48.140 --> 03:21:52.140
You stop upsetting Ninny or I'll get really angry.

03:21:52.140 --> 03:21:55.140
Without those feet she'd be perfect for a bank robbery.

03:21:55.140 --> 03:21:59.140
Well, she's getting visible again, so she'll be no good to you at all, stinky.

03:21:59.140 --> 03:22:01.140
You couldn't see any of her yesterday.

03:22:01.140 --> 03:22:03.140
Not even the feet.

03:22:03.140 --> 03:22:04.140
Oh, oh.

03:22:04.140 --> 03:22:05.140
They're disappearing again.

03:22:05.140 --> 03:22:09.140
Mom, you have to do a scare of it.

03:22:09.140 --> 03:22:12.140
Oh, see, she's gone.

03:22:12.140 --> 03:22:14.140
It's all your fault, stinky.

03:22:14.140 --> 03:22:18.140
Yes, it's like I told you before she'd make a brilliant bank robbery.

03:22:18.140 --> 03:22:20.140
Don't you agree?

03:22:20.140 --> 03:22:21.140
Perfect.

03:22:21.140 --> 03:22:25.140
Ninny would never do such a thing as that.

03:22:25.140 --> 03:22:28.140
And anyway, Mom is given her one of Granny's magic remedies.

03:22:28.140 --> 03:22:31.140
She'll soon be visible again, so they're there.

03:22:39.140 --> 03:22:41.140
Whose basket is this?

03:22:41.140 --> 03:22:43.140
Mine in little mice.

03:22:43.140 --> 03:22:46.140
Well, there's not many of them, but they certainly are pretty.

03:22:46.140 --> 03:22:49.140
There weren't many left for us to get.

03:22:49.140 --> 03:22:51.140
Because Ninny has picked them all.

03:22:51.140 --> 03:22:55.140
It doesn't really matter how many you've got, because you can't eat them.

03:22:55.140 --> 03:22:57.140
Let me show you.

03:22:57.140 --> 03:23:00.140
Now, this is deadly, tufted toad stool.

03:23:00.140 --> 03:23:02.140
And this is cow's vein.

03:23:02.140 --> 03:23:05.140
You must remember what they look like.

03:23:05.140 --> 03:23:08.140
Ah, these are movements and sniff I should think.

03:23:08.140 --> 03:23:10.140
We didn't pick any poisonous ones.

03:23:10.140 --> 03:23:13.140
Not quite as many as Snork Maiden and Little My,

03:23:13.140 --> 03:23:17.140
but this is body flybane and insiduous pepper spunk.

03:23:17.140 --> 03:23:19.140
And you've both got cow's vein, too.

03:23:19.140 --> 03:23:21.140
You must be more careful.

03:23:21.140 --> 03:23:22.140
Now, this is better.

03:23:22.140 --> 03:23:25.140
There's not one mushroom in here that you can't eat.

03:23:25.140 --> 03:23:28.140
How did Ninny manage to do this all on her own?

03:23:28.140 --> 03:23:30.140
What a very clever girl she is.

03:23:30.140 --> 03:23:32.140
Ninny, where are you?

03:23:32.140 --> 03:23:34.140
Come here a minute.

03:23:34.140 --> 03:23:36.140
Ninny, didn't you hear?

03:23:36.140 --> 03:23:38.140
Mama wants you.

03:23:40.140 --> 03:23:43.140
Ninny, this is a beautiful mushroom basket.

03:23:43.140 --> 03:23:46.140
We'll have a feast tonight.

03:23:46.140 --> 03:23:49.140
Her feet have come back.

03:23:49.140 --> 03:23:51.140
Oh, I'm so glad.

03:23:51.140 --> 03:23:54.140
We'll soon be able to see your face.

03:23:54.140 --> 03:23:56.140
It won't take long at all, Ninny.

03:23:56.140 --> 03:23:58.140
And you mustn't worry about stinky one little bit.

03:23:58.140 --> 03:24:00.140
He's all talk.

03:24:00.140 --> 03:24:03.140
If something upsets you, just think of something else.

03:24:03.140 --> 03:24:06.140
At least that's my philosophy in life.

03:24:07.140 --> 03:24:09.140
If somebody upsets you, ignore him.

03:24:09.140 --> 03:24:11.140
That's my philosophy, Ninny.

03:24:11.140 --> 03:24:14.140
Anyone who picks mushrooms like this deserves to be seen.

03:24:14.140 --> 03:24:17.140
You mustn't let anything frighten you when you're with us.

03:24:17.140 --> 03:24:19.140
Do you understand?

03:24:22.140 --> 03:24:25.140
Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.

03:24:25.140 --> 03:24:27.140
That's just great, Ninny.

03:24:27.140 --> 03:24:29.140
Oh, that's wonderful, Ninny, wonderful.

03:24:29.140 --> 03:24:32.140
I can't wait to see all of you.

03:24:32.140 --> 03:24:34.140
It won't be long now.

03:24:34.140 --> 03:24:37.140
I don't think Mouse Gray is quite your color, you know.

03:24:55.140 --> 03:24:57.140
You just sleep as long as you like, Ninny.

03:24:57.140 --> 03:24:58.140
Good night now.

03:24:58.140 --> 03:25:01.140
If you want anything, you just shout.

03:25:04.140 --> 03:25:05.140
Good night.

03:25:05.140 --> 03:25:06.140
Good night.

03:25:06.140 --> 03:25:07.140
Good night.

03:25:07.140 --> 03:25:08.140
Good night.

03:25:08.140 --> 03:25:09.140
Good night.

03:25:09.140 --> 03:25:10.140
Good night.

03:25:10.140 --> 03:25:11.140
Good night.

03:25:11.140 --> 03:25:12.140
Good night.

03:25:12.140 --> 03:25:13.140
Good night.

03:25:13.140 --> 03:25:14.140
Good night.

03:25:14.140 --> 03:25:15.140
Good night.

03:25:15.140 --> 03:25:16.140
Good night.

03:25:16.140 --> 03:25:17.140
Good night.

03:25:17.140 --> 03:25:18.140
Good night.

03:25:18.140 --> 03:25:19.140
Good night.

03:25:19.140 --> 03:25:20.140
Good night.

03:25:20.140 --> 03:25:21.140
Good night.

03:25:21.140 --> 03:25:31.140
Uh...

03:25:31.140 --> 03:25:33.140
Oh.

03:25:33.140 --> 03:25:35.140
Oh.

03:25:35.140 --> 03:25:36.140
Oh.

03:25:36.140 --> 03:25:38.140
Oh.

03:25:38.140 --> 03:25:42.140
Oh, where's Mom and Momma?

03:25:42.140 --> 03:25:55.140
Well, well. What are you doing? Do you know what time it is?

03:25:55.140 --> 03:26:01.140
Do you like this moment, Papa? Yes, it's very nice.

03:26:01.140 --> 03:26:06.140
It's good to have someone in the house to make clothes for it last. I hope it'll look pretty on her.

03:26:06.140 --> 03:26:09.140
What's this for? Her hair!

03:26:12.140 --> 03:26:17.140
Good morning, Moomin, Papa.

03:26:17.140 --> 03:26:19.140
Good morning, Lila.

03:26:19.140 --> 03:26:22.140
I'm coming.

03:26:22.140 --> 03:26:25.140
I'm coming.

03:26:25.140 --> 03:26:27.140
I'm coming.

03:26:27.140 --> 03:26:30.140
I'm coming.

03:26:30.140 --> 03:26:33.140
I'm coming.

03:26:33.140 --> 03:26:36.140
I'm coming.

03:26:36.140 --> 03:26:40.140
Good morning, Papa.

03:26:40.140 --> 03:26:42.140
Good morning, Moomin, Papa.

03:26:42.140 --> 03:26:45.140
Good morning, Little Mai. You're very early today. Where's Nini?

03:26:45.140 --> 03:26:47.140
Still in bed.

03:26:47.140 --> 03:26:49.140
You're up early.

03:26:49.140 --> 03:26:54.140
I can't wait to see her. Come on, man.

03:26:58.140 --> 03:27:01.140
It's like waiting for Christmas, isn't it?

03:27:01.140 --> 03:27:05.140
Yeah, I like having Christmas every day. Isn't it, Papa?

03:27:05.140 --> 03:27:12.140
Well, I think it's much more exciting this way. We have to wait until she's ready to come down.

03:27:12.140 --> 03:27:18.140
Did you hear that door opening? She's awake.

03:27:18.140 --> 03:27:23.140
I hope she found the dress where I left it on the table.

03:27:36.140 --> 03:27:42.140
Oh, good. It's all right. Now you know where to look.

03:27:42.140 --> 03:27:48.140
Well, she's OK, I suppose.

03:27:48.140 --> 03:27:53.140
Thank you all very much for everything.

03:27:53.140 --> 03:27:58.140
Oh. So she can talk.

03:27:58.140 --> 03:28:05.140
They still couldn't see Nini's face, but at least they knew that she was there, and that she was talking to them.

03:28:05.140 --> 03:28:07.140
It made them all feel a lot better.

03:28:07.140 --> 03:28:10.140
It made them look.

03:28:10.140 --> 03:28:13.140
It made them look better.

03:28:13.140 --> 03:28:18.140
It made them look better.

03:28:18.140 --> 03:28:23.140
It made them look better.

03:28:23.140 --> 03:28:42.140
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.

03:28:42.140 --> 03:28:50.140
Believing in sharing and caring, and giving the movements.

03:28:50.140 --> 03:28:54.140
They're always happy and always at play.

03:28:54.140 --> 03:28:57.140
The movements are having fun day after day.

03:28:57.140 --> 03:29:01.140
The movements.

03:29:01.140 --> 03:29:05.140
The movements.

03:29:05.140 --> 03:29:12.140
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.

03:29:12.140 --> 03:29:19.140
Believing in sharing and caring, and giving the movements.

03:29:19.140 --> 03:29:23.140
They're always happy and always at play.

03:29:23.140 --> 03:29:26.140
The movements are having fun day after day.

03:29:26.140 --> 03:29:30.140
The movements.

03:29:30.140 --> 03:29:34.140
The movements.

03:29:34.140 --> 03:29:39.140
The movements.

03:29:49.140 --> 03:30:01.140
Here they are for one and all.

03:30:01.140 --> 03:30:04.140
The movements are about to come.

03:30:04.140 --> 03:30:07.140
Come on and sit down here with me.

03:30:07.140 --> 03:30:10.140
They're here for you on your TV.

03:30:10.140 --> 03:30:13.140
They are the movements.

03:30:13.140 --> 03:30:16.140
They are the movements.

03:30:16.140 --> 03:30:19.140
Come with me, give me your hand.

03:30:19.140 --> 03:30:22.140
I'll take you up to a movement land.

03:30:22.140 --> 03:30:25.140
You can fly just like a bird.

03:30:25.140 --> 03:30:27.140
Sing that song ever.

03:30:27.140 --> 03:30:30.140
There were the movements.

03:30:30.140 --> 03:30:33.140
There were the movements.

03:30:33.140 --> 03:30:36.140
There were the movements.

03:30:36.140 --> 03:30:39.140
There were the movements.

03:30:39.140 --> 03:30:42.140
There were the movements.

03:30:42.140 --> 03:30:45.140
There were the movements.

03:30:45.140 --> 03:30:48.140
There were the movements.

03:30:48.140 --> 03:30:51.140
There were the movements.

03:30:51.140 --> 03:30:55.140
There were the movements.

03:30:55.140 --> 03:30:59.140
There were the movements.

03:30:59.140 --> 03:31:03.140
There were the movements.

03:31:03.140 --> 03:31:07.140
There were the movements.

03:31:07.140 --> 03:31:11.140
There were the movements.

03:31:11.140 --> 03:31:20.140
There were the movements.

03:31:35.140 --> 03:31:38.140
They can't catch me.

03:31:38.140 --> 03:31:40.140
Hey, oh, miss me!

03:31:43.140 --> 03:31:45.140
Hey, where's Danny?

03:31:45.140 --> 03:31:49.140
I asked her if she wanted to play with us, and she said yes!

03:31:51.140 --> 03:31:55.140
Danny, come on, we're going to have some fun!

03:32:08.140 --> 03:32:10.140
Right, let's go!

03:32:13.140 --> 03:32:19.140
Ninny, who became invisible because of her sarcastic aunt, was now visible up to the neck.

03:32:19.140 --> 03:32:24.140
But no matter how much of Granny's remedy she took or how nice the movements were to her,

03:32:24.140 --> 03:32:27.140
her head still remained invisible.

03:32:39.140 --> 03:32:41.140
That's the invisible child.

03:32:41.140 --> 03:32:44.140
I wonder what she really looks like.

03:32:44.140 --> 03:32:47.140
Oh, well, good morning, everybody!

03:32:47.140 --> 03:32:51.140
Morning, lazy bones! We've been up for hours and hours!

03:32:51.140 --> 03:32:53.140
We're going to play hide-and-seek in the woods.

03:32:53.140 --> 03:32:56.140
Great! Ninny, are you all right?

03:32:56.140 --> 03:32:58.140
Yes, thanks.

03:32:58.140 --> 03:33:02.140
This is dumb. If I could see your face, I wouldn't have to ask.

03:33:02.140 --> 03:33:06.140
Doesn't help with you, Sniff. You always ask silly questions.

03:33:09.140 --> 03:33:12.140
It's a bit big for hide-and-seek, isn't it?

03:33:12.140 --> 03:33:14.140
But that's what's so good about it!

03:33:15.140 --> 03:33:20.140
It's a bit big for hide-and-seek, isn't it?

03:33:20.140 --> 03:33:23.140
But that's what's so good about it!

03:33:35.140 --> 03:33:39.140
Okay, this is a good place to start, but we've got a new rule for the game.

03:33:40.140 --> 03:33:43.140
Once you found somewhere to hide, you've got to stay in the same place,

03:33:43.140 --> 03:33:45.140
no moving about anyone.

03:33:45.140 --> 03:33:48.140
Do you understand, Ninny?

03:33:48.140 --> 03:33:50.140
Right, you're to go first, Sniff.

03:33:50.140 --> 03:33:52.140
Why isn't always me first?

03:33:52.140 --> 03:33:54.140
We'll have a practice for Ninny's sake.

03:33:54.140 --> 03:33:56.140
Show her what to do.

03:33:56.140 --> 03:33:58.140
Uh, hide-and-seek is an easy game.

03:33:58.140 --> 03:34:01.140
Not for Ninny, it isn't. She's never played it before.

03:34:01.140 --> 03:34:03.140
What? Never ever?

03:34:03.140 --> 03:34:05.140
No, and not just hide-and-seek.

03:34:05.140 --> 03:34:07.140
She hasn't played any games at all.

03:34:07.140 --> 03:34:09.140
Not even when she was visible?

03:34:09.140 --> 03:34:10.140
No, nothing.

03:34:10.140 --> 03:34:12.140
Oh, that's terrible.

03:34:12.140 --> 03:34:13.140
So, will you go first?

03:34:13.140 --> 03:34:15.140
No, I won't.

03:34:15.140 --> 03:34:17.140
Okay, I'll go first then.

03:34:17.140 --> 03:34:22.140
I'll count to 10 slowly, so you'll have plenty of time to find somewhere.

03:34:22.140 --> 03:34:26.140
One, two, three.

03:34:29.140 --> 03:34:32.140
Go on, Ninny, hurry up.

03:34:32.140 --> 03:34:36.140
Four, five.

03:34:36.140 --> 03:34:43.140
I can still see you.

03:34:43.140 --> 03:34:46.140
Six.

03:34:50.140 --> 03:34:53.140
Seven.

03:34:53.140 --> 03:34:55.140
Good, good, good.

03:34:55.140 --> 03:34:57.140
Eight.

03:35:00.140 --> 03:35:03.140
Nine.

03:35:04.140 --> 03:35:07.140
Ten.

03:35:07.140 --> 03:35:09.140
Hello, Ninny.

03:35:09.140 --> 03:35:11.140
Don't be frightened.

03:35:11.140 --> 03:35:13.140
Why don't you hide in that bush over there?

03:35:13.140 --> 03:35:16.140
He'll never find you.

03:35:16.140 --> 03:35:18.140
I'm coming.

03:35:18.140 --> 03:35:21.140
Thank you.

03:35:34.140 --> 03:35:36.140
Ouch, my dear.

03:35:36.140 --> 03:35:38.140
God, you sniff.

03:35:58.140 --> 03:36:01.140
Okay.

03:36:04.140 --> 03:36:07.140
Okay.

03:36:27.140 --> 03:36:29.140
Got you, Little Mike.

03:36:29.140 --> 03:36:31.140
No.

03:36:31.140 --> 03:36:34.140
No, we're Ninny's hiding.

03:36:37.140 --> 03:36:39.140
Oh, look.

03:36:39.140 --> 03:36:42.140
Oh.

03:36:45.140 --> 03:36:47.140
Ah, come out, Ninny.

03:36:47.140 --> 03:36:48.140
I've got you.

03:36:48.140 --> 03:36:51.140
That was a good place, but I saw your ribbons.

03:36:51.140 --> 03:36:53.140
Oh.

03:36:53.140 --> 03:36:54.140
Now for snort, Maiden.

03:36:54.140 --> 03:36:58.140
She's always easy to find.

03:36:59.140 --> 03:37:01.140
Ha.

03:37:01.140 --> 03:37:03.140
That's only because she wants to be found.

03:37:03.140 --> 03:37:05.140
Found you, snort, Maiden.

03:37:05.140 --> 03:37:08.140
One.

03:37:10.140 --> 03:37:13.140
Two.

03:37:17.140 --> 03:37:18.140
Three.

03:37:18.140 --> 03:37:19.140
Don't wait, Ninny.

03:37:19.140 --> 03:37:22.140
This is my bush.

03:37:22.140 --> 03:37:25.140
Four.

03:37:29.140 --> 03:37:31.140
Hey, Ninny.

03:37:31.140 --> 03:37:33.140
I'll show you a good place.

03:37:33.140 --> 03:37:36.140
Just come with your uncle stinky.

03:37:46.140 --> 03:37:47.140
Now, don't worry.

03:37:47.140 --> 03:37:48.140
No one will find you there.

03:37:48.140 --> 03:37:50.140
It opens up once you're inside.

03:37:50.140 --> 03:37:51.140
Come on.

03:37:51.140 --> 03:37:52.140
It's a bit steep.

03:37:52.140 --> 03:37:55.140
I'll help you.

03:37:59.140 --> 03:38:01.140
Oh.

03:38:07.140 --> 03:38:08.140
Right.

03:38:08.140 --> 03:38:10.140
That should keep you quiet.

03:38:10.140 --> 03:38:12.140
You're a bit too visible at the moment.

03:38:12.140 --> 03:38:13.140
Oh, let me out.

03:38:13.140 --> 03:38:17.140
But I'm sure if you stay here until tomorrow, no one will see it all.

03:38:17.140 --> 03:38:20.140
Please don't leave me here.

03:38:20.140 --> 03:38:22.140
Please.

03:38:29.140 --> 03:38:31.140
That's it.

03:38:31.140 --> 03:38:34.140
Now tomorrow, we'll hit the bank.

03:38:42.140 --> 03:38:44.140
Let me out.

03:38:44.140 --> 03:38:46.140
Please let me out.

03:38:48.140 --> 03:38:52.140
I'm very glad I thought of bringing Ninny here.

03:38:52.140 --> 03:38:54.140
It's nice to have her here too, Tiki.

03:38:54.140 --> 03:38:56.140
She's no trouble at all.

03:38:56.140 --> 03:39:01.140
She's all pretty eccentric, and it might be just what she needs to make her want to be seen again.

03:39:01.140 --> 03:39:04.140
Oh, and you're very kind, of course.

03:39:04.140 --> 03:39:05.140
Well, thank you.

03:39:05.140 --> 03:39:08.140
I think I suppose we should be flattered, shouldn't we?

03:39:08.140 --> 03:39:10.140
Oh, yes, definitely.

03:39:10.140 --> 03:39:13.140
She started to talk, but her voice is very weak.

03:39:13.140 --> 03:39:15.140
You have to listen very carefully.

03:39:15.140 --> 03:39:18.140
Has it always been like that or just since she was invisible?

03:39:18.140 --> 03:39:19.140
I'm not sure.

03:39:19.140 --> 03:39:21.140
I don't think it was like that before.

03:39:21.140 --> 03:39:26.140
Lots of people manage very well without using their heads, so I'm certain Ninny will be all right.

03:39:26.140 --> 03:39:30.140
Yes, and I'm glad she's got movement in the others to play with.

03:39:30.140 --> 03:39:33.140
She's never had anybody before, you know.

03:39:33.140 --> 03:39:35.140
I think she'd find it a bit difficult to Tiki.

03:39:35.140 --> 03:39:40.140
Well, Mum and Mama, I think that all she needs is something to shock her out of it.

03:39:40.140 --> 03:39:42.140
Huh, got you a little, Mai.

03:39:42.140 --> 03:39:45.140
Oh, that bush was too prickly anyway.

03:39:45.140 --> 03:39:47.140
I expect I'm the last one, hey.

03:39:47.140 --> 03:39:49.140
No, I haven't found Ninny yet.

03:39:49.140 --> 03:39:50.140
Ninny?

03:39:50.140 --> 03:39:52.140
I didn't think Ninny would hide so well.

03:39:52.140 --> 03:39:54.140
Any luck, Sniff?

03:39:54.140 --> 03:39:56.140
There's nowhere else to look, Mum and.

03:39:56.140 --> 03:39:59.140
Perhaps she's lost or fallen or hurt herself.

03:39:59.140 --> 03:40:02.140
Oh, I've looked absolutely everywhere.

03:40:02.140 --> 03:40:04.140
I bet she's invisible again.

03:40:04.140 --> 03:40:06.140
That's why I can't find her.

03:40:06.140 --> 03:40:09.140
I bet Sniff hasn't looked everywhere.

03:40:09.140 --> 03:40:10.140
She can't be far.

03:40:10.140 --> 03:40:12.140
Do you know where she is, Mum and?

03:40:12.140 --> 03:40:14.140
No, I haven't seen her at all.

03:40:14.140 --> 03:40:17.140
Not since we started.

03:40:17.140 --> 03:40:18.140
Ninny!

03:40:18.140 --> 03:40:20.140
Come on, we're going home.

03:40:20.140 --> 03:40:22.140
We've finished playing.

03:40:22.140 --> 03:40:23.140
Ninny!

03:40:23.140 --> 03:40:24.140
Oh, my goodness.

03:40:24.140 --> 03:40:25.140
Where could she be?

03:40:25.140 --> 03:40:26.140
Ninny!

03:40:26.140 --> 03:40:27.140
It's your turn, Sniff.

03:40:27.140 --> 03:40:28.140
See, you've got to find her.

03:40:28.140 --> 03:40:29.140
Ninny!

03:40:29.140 --> 03:40:31.140
Not once the game's over, I haven't.

03:40:31.140 --> 03:40:32.140
Never mind.

03:40:32.140 --> 03:40:33.140
We'll all look.

03:40:33.140 --> 03:40:35.140
We must find her.

03:40:35.140 --> 03:40:38.140
We are supposed to be looking after her, you know?

03:40:38.140 --> 03:40:41.140
Oh, come on.

03:40:41.140 --> 03:40:43.140
Ninny, the game's over.

03:40:43.140 --> 03:40:44.140
We've finished.

03:40:44.140 --> 03:40:45.140
Ninny!

03:40:45.140 --> 03:40:46.140
Ninny!

03:40:46.140 --> 03:40:47.140
Hurry up!

03:40:47.140 --> 03:40:49.140
We're going home for cookies and lemonade!

03:40:49.140 --> 03:40:50.140
Ninny!

03:40:50.140 --> 03:40:51.140
Ninny!

03:40:51.140 --> 03:40:52.140
Ninny!

03:40:52.140 --> 03:40:53.140
Ninny!

03:40:53.140 --> 03:40:54.140
Ninny!

03:40:54.140 --> 03:40:55.140
Ninny!

03:40:55.140 --> 03:40:56.140
Ninny!

03:40:56.140 --> 03:40:57.140
Ninny!

03:40:57.140 --> 03:40:58.140
Ninny!

03:40:58.140 --> 03:40:59.140
Ninny!

03:40:59.140 --> 03:41:00.140
Ninny!

03:41:00.140 --> 03:41:01.140
Ninny!

03:41:01.140 --> 03:41:02.140
Ninny!

03:41:02.140 --> 03:41:03.140
Ninny!

03:41:03.140 --> 03:41:04.140
Ninny!

03:41:04.140 --> 03:41:05.140
Ninny!

03:41:05.140 --> 03:41:06.140
Ninny!

03:41:06.140 --> 03:41:07.140
Ninny!

03:41:07.140 --> 03:41:08.140
Ninny!

03:41:08.140 --> 03:41:09.140
Ninny!

03:41:09.140 --> 03:41:10.140
Ninny!

03:41:10.140 --> 03:41:11.140
Can you hear us?

03:41:11.140 --> 03:41:14.140
We weren't supposed to come this far, Snort Maiden.

03:41:14.140 --> 03:41:18.140
We might be really lost or frightened or anything.

03:41:18.140 --> 03:41:19.140
Ninny!

03:41:19.140 --> 03:41:20.140
Where are you, Ninny?

03:41:20.140 --> 03:41:22.140
Can you hear me?

03:41:22.140 --> 03:41:23.140
Ninny!

03:41:23.140 --> 03:41:24.140
Help!

03:41:24.140 --> 03:41:26.140
I'm over here!

03:41:26.140 --> 03:41:29.140
Did you hear something?

03:41:29.140 --> 03:41:31.140
I'm not sure.

03:41:31.140 --> 03:41:32.140
Help!

03:41:32.140 --> 03:41:33.140
Help!

03:41:33.140 --> 03:41:34.140
I'm here!

03:41:34.140 --> 03:41:35.140
Help!

03:41:35.140 --> 03:41:37.140
That's her!

03:41:37.140 --> 03:41:39.140
She's not far away!

03:41:39.140 --> 03:41:40.140
Ninny!

03:41:40.140 --> 03:41:41.140
Where are you?

03:41:41.140 --> 03:41:42.140
Here!

03:41:42.140 --> 03:41:44.140
Behind this rock!

03:41:44.140 --> 03:41:46.140
Where's her voice coming from?

03:41:46.140 --> 03:41:48.140
That way, I think.

03:41:48.140 --> 03:41:49.140
Ninny!

03:41:49.140 --> 03:41:51.140
I can't hear what you're saying!

03:41:51.140 --> 03:41:53.140
Try and shout a bit louder!

03:41:53.140 --> 03:41:55.140
I'm over here!

03:41:55.140 --> 03:41:56.140
Over here!

03:41:56.140 --> 03:41:58.140
Behind the rock!

03:41:58.140 --> 03:42:00.140
I still can't hear properly!

03:42:00.140 --> 03:42:02.140
Louder than any louder!

03:42:02.140 --> 03:42:04.140
Behind the rock!

03:42:04.140 --> 03:42:06.140
Which rock?

03:42:06.140 --> 03:42:07.140
Over here!

03:42:07.140 --> 03:42:09.140
The big rock!

03:42:10.140 --> 03:42:13.140
Over there!

03:42:13.140 --> 03:42:18.140
I've never shouted so much in my life!

03:42:18.140 --> 03:42:19.140
Ninny!

03:42:19.140 --> 03:42:20.140
Ninny!

03:42:20.140 --> 03:42:22.140
Are you behind this rock, Ninny?

03:42:22.140 --> 03:42:23.140
Yes!

03:42:23.140 --> 03:42:25.140
Stinky block the cave with it!

03:42:25.140 --> 03:42:26.140
Don't worry!

03:42:26.140 --> 03:42:27.140
We'll get you out!

03:42:27.140 --> 03:42:28.140
Hang on!

03:42:36.140 --> 03:42:37.140
Are you alright, Ninny?

03:42:37.140 --> 03:42:39.140
Thank you, Mum!

03:42:39.140 --> 03:42:42.140
Oh, thank you!

03:42:42.140 --> 03:42:44.140
Your voice seems to be...

03:42:44.140 --> 03:42:45.140
Oh, what?

03:42:45.140 --> 03:42:47.140
Oh, nothing!

03:42:47.140 --> 03:42:50.140
Try and hold on to me, and I'll call you out!

03:42:50.140 --> 03:42:52.140
Oh, thank you!

03:42:57.140 --> 03:42:58.140
Hey!

03:42:58.140 --> 03:43:00.140
What's happened?

03:43:00.140 --> 03:43:01.140
Where's your finder?

03:43:01.140 --> 03:43:02.140
In the cave!

03:43:02.140 --> 03:43:03.140
Wow!

03:43:03.140 --> 03:43:05.140
What a brilliant hiding place had you find it!

03:43:05.140 --> 03:43:08.140
What's wrong?

03:43:08.140 --> 03:43:10.140
Did I say something funny?

03:43:13.140 --> 03:43:15.140
Now, that was very mean of Stinky's.

03:43:15.140 --> 03:43:18.140
A clever idea, though, of interuser for a van robbery.

03:43:18.140 --> 03:43:19.140
Oh, Papa!

03:43:19.140 --> 03:43:21.140
Oh, I know Stinky shouldn't have done it,

03:43:21.140 --> 03:43:25.140
and it must have been a nasty shopping trapped in the dark in that cave,

03:43:25.140 --> 03:43:28.140
but no real harm came to her, and she didn't disappear,

03:43:28.140 --> 03:43:30.140
and her voice got much stronger.

03:43:30.140 --> 03:43:32.140
Because she yelled so loud!

03:43:32.140 --> 03:43:35.140
Oh, goodness! Did you, dear?

03:43:35.140 --> 03:43:37.140
Yes, Mum and Mama!

03:43:37.140 --> 03:43:41.140
Mum and told me to yell loudly, so he'd know where I was!

03:43:41.140 --> 03:43:43.140
And it was loud, too!

03:43:43.140 --> 03:43:44.140
Good for you, Ninny.

03:43:44.140 --> 03:43:47.140
It's surprising the things you can do if you have to,

03:43:47.140 --> 03:43:52.140
and you ought to remember that people who speak loudly are usually very noticeable.

03:43:52.140 --> 03:43:55.140
Go on, yo! I want to see it!

03:43:55.140 --> 03:43:57.140
That's a good idea, Ninny.

03:43:57.140 --> 03:43:59.140
If shouting brought back your voice,

03:43:59.140 --> 03:44:01.140
you never know it might be just what's needed to make the rest of you visible.

03:44:01.140 --> 03:44:03.140
Try and get angry, as well.

03:44:03.140 --> 03:44:06.140
Yeah, that's easy. Just think about Stinky.

03:44:06.140 --> 03:44:08.140
Yeah, and how horrible he is!

03:44:08.140 --> 03:44:11.140
That should make you angry. Very angry!

03:44:14.140 --> 03:44:16.140
Just your white Stinky!

03:44:16.140 --> 03:44:18.140
I care how fast it may be!

03:44:21.140 --> 03:44:24.140
Stinky, wait! We want to talk to you!

03:44:24.140 --> 03:44:25.140
I don't want to talk to you!

03:44:25.140 --> 03:44:26.140
No!

03:44:28.140 --> 03:44:30.140
Oh, you are right, Sniff!

03:44:31.140 --> 03:44:34.140
You can't get away, Stinky.

03:44:35.140 --> 03:44:38.140
The forest is my home ground! You won't catch me in here!

03:44:38.140 --> 03:44:39.140
Ah!

03:44:44.140 --> 03:44:46.140
I did it!

03:44:46.140 --> 03:44:48.140
Hold it.

03:44:54.140 --> 03:44:56.140
You can't do this to me!

03:44:56.140 --> 03:44:58.140
We're only doing what you did to Ninny!

03:44:58.140 --> 03:45:02.140
Now look, I needed her to help me! I did, I tell ya!

03:45:02.140 --> 03:45:04.140
But she didn't want to, huh?

03:45:04.140 --> 03:45:08.140
That's why I put her down this hole to change her mind!

03:45:08.140 --> 03:45:12.140
And scare her so much that she'd become totally invisible again!

03:45:12.140 --> 03:45:16.140
She had to be invisible for my plan! Now get me out of here!

03:45:16.140 --> 03:45:18.140
It's all right, Stinky. See you tomorrow!

03:45:18.140 --> 03:45:20.140
No! Good!

03:45:23.140 --> 03:45:25.140
You crushed few things!

03:45:25.140 --> 03:45:28.140
I had such a wonderful plan!

03:45:28.140 --> 03:45:32.140
Ah! Ah! You're spiteful!

03:45:32.140 --> 03:45:35.140
Oh, let's hear them my next job!

03:45:35.140 --> 03:45:40.140
But despite all that had happened, Ninny's face was still not to be seen.

03:45:42.140 --> 03:45:45.140
Then, about ten days later.

03:45:55.140 --> 03:45:58.140
This weather seems to push the nails out.

03:46:00.140 --> 03:46:04.140
I haven't seen anyone stare at the sea like Ninny does.

03:46:04.140 --> 03:46:07.140
Well, maybe she's never seen it before!

03:46:11.140 --> 03:46:14.140
Oh, she's crying now!

03:46:26.140 --> 03:46:30.140
What's the matter?

03:46:30.140 --> 03:46:34.140
It's the sea! It's far too big!

03:46:35.140 --> 03:46:38.140
You don't have to go on it, you know.

03:46:39.140 --> 03:46:42.140
Mama! Mama! What's up?

03:46:46.140 --> 03:46:48.140
What's the matter with her?

03:46:48.140 --> 03:46:53.140
Nothing to worry about. She's never seen the sea before and she's just surprised at how big it is.

03:46:56.140 --> 03:47:00.140
Well, there's an awful lot of water, that's for sure.

03:47:06.140 --> 03:47:10.140
Ninny's lucky. I wish there was something to surprise or excite me.

03:47:10.140 --> 03:47:13.140
Nothing's happened for weeks. Anything would be nice.

03:47:13.140 --> 03:47:15.140
Mama must be bored.

03:47:15.140 --> 03:47:17.140
I think you're right.

03:47:17.140 --> 03:47:19.140
But she never gets bored.

03:47:19.140 --> 03:47:21.140
Well, she is now. She needs something to happen.

03:47:21.140 --> 03:47:24.140
I think we should do something to surprise her.

03:47:24.140 --> 03:47:26.140
Like what?

03:47:26.140 --> 03:47:28.140
Well, I know what we can do.

03:47:28.140 --> 03:47:29.140
Well, tell me.

03:47:29.140 --> 03:47:32.140
We'll creep up behind her and just give her a little push.

03:47:32.140 --> 03:47:35.140
What, Papa? Push her into the sea?

03:47:35.140 --> 03:47:38.140
Oh, Papa, you can't. Mama wouldn't like it.

03:47:38.140 --> 03:47:39.140
Just watch me.

03:47:39.140 --> 03:47:42.140
But the water's freezing. A mama will get all wet.

03:47:42.140 --> 03:47:45.140
We never found the water too cold when we were your age.

03:47:45.140 --> 03:47:47.140
You young people today have no sense of fun.

03:47:47.140 --> 03:47:49.140
Did you really used to do things like that?

03:47:49.140 --> 03:47:51.140
All the time.

03:47:51.140 --> 03:47:52.140
Papa?

03:47:52.140 --> 03:47:53.140
Yes, Mum.

03:47:53.140 --> 03:47:54.140
Oh, nothing.

03:47:54.140 --> 03:47:56.140
Don't worry, Mum.

03:47:56.140 --> 03:47:59.140
Mama enjoys a prank. She'll find it very funny. I promise.

03:48:19.140 --> 03:48:21.140
I know you don't.

03:48:21.140 --> 03:48:26.140
No, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:48:26.140 --> 03:48:29.140
Don't you dare push her into that big horrible sea?

03:48:29.140 --> 03:48:30.140
Let me explain to me.

03:48:30.140 --> 03:48:33.140
There's nothing to explain. You're a big bully.

03:48:33.140 --> 03:48:35.140
She didn't go all wet.

03:48:35.140 --> 03:48:37.140
What a nasty trick.

03:48:37.140 --> 03:48:39.140
You could never...

03:48:39.140 --> 03:48:41.140
Never.

03:48:41.140 --> 03:48:43.140
Mummy, she didn't go all wet.

03:48:43.140 --> 03:48:45.140
What a nasty trick.

03:48:45.140 --> 03:48:46.140
You could never...

03:48:46.140 --> 03:48:48.140
Never.

03:48:59.140 --> 03:49:00.140
Mimi.

03:49:04.140 --> 03:49:06.140
There's your face, hurry!

03:49:06.140 --> 03:49:07.140
Hurry!

03:49:07.140 --> 03:49:08.140
Hurry!

03:49:08.140 --> 03:49:12.140
That's the last thing to see you.

03:49:12.140 --> 03:49:17.140
What on earth happened? Were you up to something?

03:49:17.140 --> 03:49:23.140
Oh, nothing much. You know, that child has got the sharpest teeth with the without our head.

03:49:23.140 --> 03:49:28.140
A woman, a woman at last. I'm visible again. We're always you won't disappear again.

03:49:28.140 --> 03:49:30.140
Never, I'll never.

03:49:30.140 --> 03:49:34.140
Brave girl, and with a good strong set of healthy teeth, too.

03:49:34.140 --> 03:49:36.140
Oh, I'm so happy, nanny.

03:49:36.140 --> 03:49:38.140
Mimi dear.

03:49:38.140 --> 03:49:42.140
I'm very glad, too.

03:49:46.140 --> 03:49:48.140
Oh.

03:49:48.140 --> 03:49:50.140
Oh.

03:49:50.140 --> 03:49:52.140
Oh.

03:49:52.140 --> 03:49:54.140
Uh.

03:49:54.140 --> 03:49:56.140
Oh.

03:49:56.140 --> 03:49:58.140
Oh.

03:49:58.140 --> 03:50:00.140
Oh.

03:50:00.140 --> 03:50:02.140
Oh.

03:50:02.140 --> 03:50:04.140
Uh.

03:50:04.140 --> 03:50:06.140
Uh.

03:50:06.140 --> 03:50:10.140
Stop laughing, you horrible child. You use sartuth monster.

03:50:10.140 --> 03:50:18.140
What's so funny, huh?

03:50:18.140 --> 03:50:20.140
Oh.

03:50:20.140 --> 03:50:22.140
Oh.

03:50:22.140 --> 03:50:24.140
Oh.

03:50:24.140 --> 03:50:26.140
Oh.

03:50:38.140 --> 03:50:40.140
Really, nanny laughed.

03:50:40.140 --> 03:50:43.140
Well, she certainly changed, momma.

03:50:43.140 --> 03:50:47.140
All she needed was to get angry, and she did.

03:50:47.140 --> 03:50:52.140
I hope movement pop is forgiven, nanny. Thank you all for taking such good care of her.

03:50:52.140 --> 03:50:56.140
I hate to say it, but she sounds almost as bad as it'll mind now.

03:50:56.140 --> 03:50:59.140
Tiki, nanny.

03:51:05.140 --> 03:51:08.140
And so nanny left movement house with Tiki.

03:51:08.140 --> 03:51:14.140
Now that she was completely visible and far from timid, she was ready for anything.

03:51:14.140 --> 03:51:19.140
Anything that is except seeing her aunt, she said.

03:51:19.140 --> 03:51:21.140
Nanny.

03:51:21.140 --> 03:51:24.140
Nanny.

03:51:24.140 --> 03:51:26.140
Nanny.

03:51:26.140 --> 03:51:29.140
Nanny.

03:51:29.140 --> 03:51:31.140
Nanny.

03:51:31.140 --> 03:51:33.140
Nanny.

03:51:33.140 --> 03:51:36.140
Nanny.

03:51:36.140 --> 03:51:38.140
Boom.

03:51:38.140 --> 03:51:40.140
Nanny.

03:51:40.140 --> 03:51:43.140
Nanny.

03:51:53.140 --> 03:52:00.140
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

03:52:00.140 --> 03:52:07.140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

03:52:07.140 --> 03:52:11.140
They're always happy and always at play.

03:52:11.140 --> 03:52:14.140
The movements are having fun day after day.

03:52:14.140 --> 03:52:18.140
The movements.

03:52:18.140 --> 03:52:22.140
The movements.

03:52:22.140 --> 03:52:29.140
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

03:52:29.140 --> 03:52:36.140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

03:52:36.140 --> 03:52:40.140
They're always happy and always at play.

03:52:40.140 --> 03:52:44.140
The movements are having fun day after day.

03:52:44.140 --> 03:52:47.140
The movements.

03:52:47.140 --> 03:52:51.140
The movements.

03:52:51.140 --> 03:52:57.140
The movements.

03:53:06.140 --> 03:53:16.140
The movements.

03:53:16.140 --> 03:53:19.140
Here they are for one and all.

03:53:19.140 --> 03:53:22.140
The movements are about to come.

03:53:22.140 --> 03:53:25.140
Come on and sit down here with me.

03:53:25.140 --> 03:53:27.140
Therefore you are your TV.

03:53:27.140 --> 03:53:30.140
They are the movements.

03:53:30.140 --> 03:53:33.140
They are the movements.

03:53:33.140 --> 03:53:37.140
So come with me, give me your hand.

03:53:37.140 --> 03:53:40.140
I'll take you up to a movement land.

03:53:40.140 --> 03:53:43.140
You can fly just like a bird.

03:53:43.140 --> 03:53:45.140
Sing that song ever.

03:53:45.140 --> 03:53:48.140
There were the movements.

03:53:48.140 --> 03:53:51.140
There were the movements.

03:53:51.140 --> 03:53:54.140
There were the movements.

03:53:54.140 --> 03:53:57.140
There were the movements.

03:53:57.140 --> 03:54:00.140
There were the movements.

03:54:00.140 --> 03:54:03.140
The movements.

03:54:30.140 --> 03:54:33.140
The movements.

03:54:33.140 --> 03:54:36.140
The movements.

03:54:36.140 --> 03:54:40.140
The movements.

03:54:40.140 --> 03:54:43.140
The movements.

03:54:43.140 --> 03:54:47.140
The movements.

03:54:47.140 --> 03:54:50.140
The movements.

03:54:50.140 --> 03:54:53.140
Snort Maiden is running as if the groke is chasing her.

03:54:53.140 --> 03:54:57.140
I don't think I've ever seen her run so fast.

03:54:57.140 --> 03:54:59.140
Ah.

03:54:59.140 --> 03:55:02.140
Ah.

03:55:02.140 --> 03:55:03.140
Ah.

03:55:03.140 --> 03:55:05.140
I wonder what's the matter?

03:55:05.140 --> 03:55:10.140
Perhaps something terrible has happened.

03:55:14.140 --> 03:55:16.140
Maiden!

03:55:16.140 --> 03:55:17.140
Maiden!

03:55:17.140 --> 03:55:20.140
Maiden Papa!

03:55:20.140 --> 03:55:21.140
Maiden Mama!

03:55:21.140 --> 03:55:24.140
No!

03:55:24.140 --> 03:55:27.840
Come down and tell us what's wrong.

03:55:27.840 --> 03:55:30.940
My brother's on the cliff, and he's about to jump off.

03:55:30.940 --> 03:55:32.040
What snorke?

03:55:32.040 --> 03:55:33.140
Are you sure?

03:55:33.140 --> 03:55:35.340
He says nothing will prevent him doing it.

03:55:35.340 --> 03:55:36.140
Oh, please.

03:55:36.140 --> 03:55:38.240
You must stop him, moment.

03:55:38.240 --> 03:55:40.720
Did you say that you wanted me to help you with something

03:55:40.720 --> 03:55:41.840
snorkemaiden?

03:55:41.840 --> 03:55:42.340
Yes.

03:55:42.340 --> 03:55:45.340
I want you to stop snorke jumping off the south side of the cliff.

03:55:45.340 --> 03:55:46.140
Oh, dear.

03:55:46.140 --> 03:55:47.840
I never thought he was the type.

03:55:47.840 --> 03:55:50.140
He says it's a test flight.

03:55:50.140 --> 03:55:50.940
Oh.

03:55:50.940 --> 03:55:52.340
Now what?

03:55:52.340 --> 03:55:54.140
A test flight, did you say?

03:55:54.140 --> 03:55:57.140
Snorkemaiden, do you mean that he's finally finished building

03:55:57.140 --> 03:55:58.940
his flying ship?

03:55:58.940 --> 03:56:00.540
No, only the blueprint.

03:56:00.540 --> 03:56:01.840
At least I think that's all.

03:56:01.840 --> 03:56:03.140
He doesn't tell me.

03:56:03.140 --> 03:56:05.540
Well, that's a start.

03:56:05.540 --> 03:56:08.040
He built a small model of the flying ship's wings,

03:56:08.040 --> 03:56:11.040
and they don't look strong enough to carry anyone.

03:56:11.040 --> 03:56:12.840
And now he's going to try them out himself

03:56:12.840 --> 03:56:13.940
to see if they'll work.

03:56:13.940 --> 03:56:15.040
And I know they won't.

03:56:15.040 --> 03:56:16.440
They'll break, you know.

03:56:16.440 --> 03:56:18.740
Now, wait a minute, snorkemaiden.

03:56:18.740 --> 03:56:20.340
Slow down and let me think.

03:56:20.340 --> 03:56:23.340
He's made the wings from the blueprint of the flying ship.

03:56:23.340 --> 03:56:25.840
Well, his plans are always very accurate.

03:56:25.840 --> 03:56:27.840
Oh, Papa, you've got to stop him.

03:56:27.840 --> 03:56:30.640
The south side, Papa.

03:56:30.640 --> 03:56:31.940
Yes, I know.

03:56:31.940 --> 03:56:34.140
The highest and steepest one of all.

03:56:34.140 --> 03:56:35.140
Oh, moment, Papa.

03:56:35.140 --> 03:56:37.540
There must be something we can do.

03:56:37.540 --> 03:56:39.140
Yes, I'm sure there is.

03:56:39.140 --> 03:56:39.640
Right.

03:56:39.640 --> 03:56:40.440
Hurry, everybody.

03:56:40.440 --> 03:56:41.740
There's no time to lose.

03:56:41.740 --> 03:56:42.740
Come on.

03:56:42.740 --> 03:56:44.740
Oh, thank you, moment, Papa.

03:56:50.340 --> 03:57:04.340
Come on.

03:57:04.340 --> 03:57:17.740
All right.

03:57:17.740 --> 03:57:20.740
Oh, my God!

03:57:20.740 --> 03:57:23.740
Oh, my God!

03:57:27.740 --> 03:57:29.740
A snork? Wait!

03:57:29.740 --> 03:57:31.740
Wait, please!

03:57:31.740 --> 03:57:34.740
Stop, snork! Don't do it!

03:57:35.740 --> 03:57:38.740
Why have you brought everybody here, snork maiden?

03:57:38.740 --> 03:57:40.740
They've come to beg you not to do it!

03:57:40.740 --> 03:57:42.740
You're too young and brilliant for such a tragic end!

03:57:42.740 --> 03:57:44.740
Thank the bobble we were in time!

03:57:44.740 --> 03:57:47.740
As a matter of fact, you weren't.

03:57:47.740 --> 03:57:48.740
Oh, really?

03:57:48.740 --> 03:57:51.740
It looks very dangerous to me, snork.

03:57:51.740 --> 03:57:53.740
Well, it's not a tall woman, Papa.

03:57:53.740 --> 03:57:56.740
I made these wings myself. They're perfectly balanced.

03:57:56.740 --> 03:57:59.740
Well, yes, I'm sure they are.

03:57:59.740 --> 03:58:03.740
The blueprints are detailed and precise. They're quite safe.

03:58:03.740 --> 03:58:08.740
Tell me, snork. Why did you stop on the edge like that after running down the slope?

03:58:08.740 --> 03:58:11.740
I was measuring the right length for my approach run.

03:58:12.740 --> 03:58:15.740
Don't do it, snork. I don't want to lose my only brother.

03:58:15.740 --> 03:58:17.740
Don't make such a fuss, snork maiden.

03:58:17.740 --> 03:58:19.740
Do you really think it's safe?

03:58:19.740 --> 03:58:23.740
Of course it is. You don't see birds falling out of the sky, do you?

03:58:23.740 --> 03:58:29.740
Well, at least, do your test flight just above the ground so that if something happens to go wrong, you won't hurt yourself.

03:58:29.740 --> 03:58:34.740
I've already done that from the roof of our house, and it worked beautifully.

03:58:34.740 --> 03:58:35.740
Did you see him?

03:58:35.740 --> 03:58:37.740
No, I didn't see anything.

03:58:37.740 --> 03:58:40.740
Of course you didn't. Do you think I let a wimpy little sister watch me?

03:58:41.740 --> 03:58:43.740
What's that supposed to mean, snork?

03:58:43.740 --> 03:58:47.740
Just that I don't want you sticking your big nose into my affairs all the time.

03:58:47.740 --> 03:58:49.740
I don't like it, and there's nothing to do with you.

03:58:49.740 --> 03:58:52.740
Yours is just as big, and I don't want to lose you.

03:58:52.740 --> 03:58:54.740
Don't go on about losing me.

03:58:54.740 --> 03:58:55.740
Why not?

03:58:55.740 --> 03:58:57.740
Come on now, you two. Stop it.

03:58:57.740 --> 03:58:58.740
Hey!

03:58:58.740 --> 03:59:00.740
Oops! That was close.

03:59:00.740 --> 03:59:03.740
Snork maiden, I don't think your brother is going to be stopped.

03:59:03.740 --> 03:59:05.740
Oh dear, oh dear.

03:59:05.740 --> 03:59:07.740
You're very brave, snork.

03:59:10.740 --> 03:59:13.740
Right, here we go.

03:59:13.740 --> 03:59:17.740
This time it'll be a perfect takeoff.

03:59:17.740 --> 03:59:19.740
It's a long way.

03:59:19.740 --> 03:59:21.740
Oh look, isn't that snuffkin down there?

03:59:21.740 --> 03:59:24.740
Where? Where is he? Where's snuffkin?

03:59:24.740 --> 03:59:27.740
You can't see him from there, Sniff. You'll have to come here.

03:59:27.740 --> 03:59:29.740
Is it really snuffkin?

03:59:29.740 --> 03:59:33.740
Yes, I'm sure it is. Snuffkin!

03:59:33.740 --> 03:59:35.740
Yeah!

03:59:35.740 --> 03:59:37.740
Baby, hear you?

03:59:37.740 --> 03:59:39.740
No, I don't think so.

03:59:39.740 --> 03:59:41.740
All right, here goes!

03:59:41.740 --> 03:59:43.740
Good luck, Snork!

04:00:00.740 --> 04:00:02.740
He's flying!

04:00:09.740 --> 04:00:11.740
Oh!

04:00:22.740 --> 04:00:24.740
It's the snork!

04:00:40.740 --> 04:00:42.740
Hey!

04:00:45.740 --> 04:00:47.740
Look at him flying!

04:00:47.740 --> 04:00:49.740
It's all right, Snork maiden.

04:00:49.740 --> 04:00:52.740
Your brother's doing fine. Come and see.

04:00:54.740 --> 04:00:57.740
He's done it! He's done it!

04:00:57.740 --> 04:01:00.740
Whoa, I knew he could do it.

04:01:00.740 --> 04:01:02.740
Well, so did I, to be honest.

04:01:02.740 --> 04:01:03.740
Huh?

04:01:03.740 --> 04:01:05.740
You, Snork!

04:01:09.740 --> 04:01:12.740
Hello!

04:01:12.740 --> 04:01:15.740
Hey! Hey!

04:01:15.740 --> 04:01:16.740
Hey!

04:01:16.740 --> 04:01:20.740
I remember this test flight is a great success!

04:01:40.740 --> 04:01:44.740
Just as I thought he can't fly and wave at the same time.

04:01:44.740 --> 04:01:47.740
Interesting!

04:01:47.740 --> 04:01:49.740
That was mean, stinky.

04:01:49.740 --> 04:01:52.740
If I could get him to wave with both arms, he'd probably fall.

04:01:52.740 --> 04:01:57.740
Look, we don't want you here, stinky. Why don't you just go away?

04:01:57.740 --> 04:02:00.740
I can find lots to do with that machine.

04:02:00.740 --> 04:02:03.740
If you won't go away, I will.

04:02:03.740 --> 04:02:08.740
Well, go on, Snuffkin. What do I care what you do?

04:02:08.740 --> 04:02:12.740
Hmm, that would be perfect for robberies.

04:02:12.740 --> 04:02:15.740
The wind seems to be taking him out to sea.

04:02:15.740 --> 04:02:18.740
Why doesn't he turn around and come back?

04:02:18.740 --> 04:02:21.740
Turning in that thing might not be so easy.

04:02:21.740 --> 04:02:23.740
What? Do you mean he can't?

04:02:23.740 --> 04:02:26.740
Well, don't worry, Snork maiden. Of course he can.

04:02:26.740 --> 04:02:31.740
Oh, what's this I can't turn on?

04:02:32.740 --> 04:02:33.740
Oh!

04:02:41.740 --> 04:02:43.740
Oh, he's hit a tree.

04:02:43.740 --> 04:02:45.740
Come on, hurry!

04:03:02.740 --> 04:03:04.740
No!

04:03:07.740 --> 04:03:09.740
Is he dead?

04:03:09.740 --> 04:03:11.740
No, he's been knocked out.

04:03:11.740 --> 04:03:13.740
He looks dead to me anyway.

04:03:13.740 --> 04:03:15.740
Where are they? What's happened to the wings?

04:03:15.740 --> 04:03:17.740
In the tree.

04:03:17.740 --> 04:03:20.740
Ah, he won't want them anymore, so now I can have them.

04:03:20.740 --> 04:03:23.740
Now, let me see.

04:03:32.740 --> 04:03:34.740
So, did the test fly go all right?

04:03:34.740 --> 04:03:37.740
Will someone tell me what happened?

04:03:37.740 --> 04:03:41.740
Well, it was fine until the very end.

04:03:41.740 --> 04:03:44.740
I'm sure that you only need a bit more practice.

04:03:44.740 --> 04:03:47.740
Flying isn't the easiest thing to master, you know.

04:03:47.740 --> 04:03:51.740
I expect so. Let's hope you don't run out of bandages, though.

04:03:51.740 --> 04:03:53.740
Excuse me.

04:03:53.740 --> 04:03:55.740
Snork?

04:03:55.740 --> 04:03:57.740
Are you going to use the wings anymore?

04:03:57.740 --> 04:03:59.740
I might not. Why?

04:03:59.740 --> 04:04:02.740
Oh, well, I'll have them if you don't want them.

04:04:02.740 --> 04:04:04.740
I want to fly in the sky, too.

04:04:04.740 --> 04:04:06.740
It looks the most exciting thing I've ever seen.

04:04:06.740 --> 04:04:08.740
Oh, please let me have them.

04:04:08.740 --> 04:04:11.740
Well, it's not as simple as that, movement.

04:04:11.740 --> 04:04:14.740
They need testing before the design changes.

04:04:14.740 --> 04:04:17.740
I'm not going to use the wings anymore.

04:04:17.740 --> 04:04:20.740
Well, I'll have them if you don't want them.

04:04:21.740 --> 04:04:24.740
They need testing before the design is complete.

04:04:24.740 --> 04:04:27.740
But I could do that, Snork. I know I could do it.

04:04:27.740 --> 04:04:29.740
Please let me have them.

04:04:29.740 --> 04:04:31.740
Well, I suppose I could do with some help.

04:04:31.740 --> 04:04:34.740
There's a lot to do, fetching and carrying mostly.

04:04:34.740 --> 04:04:37.740
You haven't said if I can have the wings or not yet, Snork.

04:04:37.740 --> 04:04:39.740
Yes, you can, but on one condition.

04:04:39.740 --> 04:04:41.740
Anything.

04:04:41.740 --> 04:04:45.740
Well, now the blueprints are finished and the wings are more or less right.

04:04:45.740 --> 04:04:49.740
I'll need somewhere to build the ship and somewhere to store all the materials

04:04:49.740 --> 04:04:51.740
so they'll be dry and at hand.

04:04:51.740 --> 04:04:54.740
Yes, you will, Snork. I can see that.

04:04:54.740 --> 04:04:58.740
It doesn't have to be much, just a roof will do, or and walls.

04:04:58.740 --> 04:05:01.740
So that people can't spy on me and steal my ideas.

04:05:01.740 --> 04:05:04.740
I can do the building myself, but I'll need some help

04:05:04.740 --> 04:05:06.740
and when it's finished, you can have the wings.

04:05:06.740 --> 04:05:08.740
Great. I'd love to help you.

04:05:08.740 --> 04:05:11.740
I'd have done that anyway, but now that I can have the wings,

04:05:11.740 --> 04:05:14.740
I'll work twice as hard. You won't regret it, Snork.

04:05:14.740 --> 04:05:16.740
I promise you you won't.

04:05:16.740 --> 04:05:19.740
Splendid, woman. That settled them.

04:05:19.740 --> 04:05:21.740
Perhaps we can get more help.

04:05:21.740 --> 04:05:24.740
I'm sure that'd be easy. How about it, Snork?

04:05:24.740 --> 04:05:26.740
Yes, of course.

04:05:26.740 --> 04:05:28.740
Will you help us do Sniff?

04:05:28.740 --> 04:05:30.740
Yes, but I want something too.

04:05:30.740 --> 04:05:33.740
I'll let you borrow the wings.

04:05:33.740 --> 04:05:37.740
No, I'm far too heavy. I only break them.

04:05:37.740 --> 04:05:41.740
Don't worry, Sniff. I'm sure I'll think of something you can have.

04:05:41.740 --> 04:05:44.740
Oh, as long as it's something nice.

04:05:44.740 --> 04:05:46.740
How I do love helping people.

04:05:46.740 --> 04:05:50.740
You're all hard, Sniff. We know that for sure.

04:05:53.740 --> 04:05:57.740
I'm sure you'll need some expert help with the shed, Snork.

04:06:08.740 --> 04:06:10.740
Surely this must be deep enough, Papa?

04:06:10.740 --> 04:06:14.740
Oh, no. We moments are always built for posterity.

04:06:14.740 --> 04:06:17.740
Besides, I like pouring cement.

04:06:17.740 --> 04:06:19.740
Okay, Papa.

04:06:34.740 --> 04:06:37.740
I've given your present a lot of fortune, all.

04:06:37.740 --> 04:06:38.740
Huh?

04:06:38.740 --> 04:06:42.740
And I think I'll give you one of my invaluable books on machinery.

04:06:42.740 --> 04:06:45.740
Oh, don't you want it?

04:06:45.740 --> 04:06:49.740
Well, if there was something else, I'm not much of a reader.

04:06:49.740 --> 04:06:53.740
What about my invaluable fountain pen?

04:06:53.740 --> 04:06:55.740
Invaluable fountain pen?

04:06:55.740 --> 04:06:57.740
What about my invaluable...

04:06:57.740 --> 04:07:00.740
Do you have anything that's not invaluable, Snork?

04:07:00.740 --> 04:07:03.740
Well, what about a gold coin?

04:07:03.740 --> 04:07:06.740
Well, that sounds great. A real gold coin?

04:07:06.740 --> 04:07:09.740
Oh, boy, yes, that's a deal.

04:07:29.740 --> 04:07:32.740
You are digging a very deep hole.

04:07:32.740 --> 04:07:35.740
Oh, why don't you stop and have some sandwiches?

04:07:35.740 --> 04:07:38.740
Should we do that, Papa? Go on.

04:07:38.740 --> 04:07:40.740
Yes, I think we can stop now.

04:07:40.740 --> 04:07:42.740
Sniff and your brother are in the woods.

04:07:42.740 --> 04:07:44.740
Yes, I know. I heard them.

04:07:51.740 --> 04:07:53.740
Hi, Snork, maybe.

04:07:55.740 --> 04:07:57.740
Oh, no.

04:07:57.740 --> 04:08:00.740
Wait a minute. I want to ask you something.

04:08:00.740 --> 04:08:01.740
What is it?

04:08:01.740 --> 04:08:05.740
Tell me, Snork, is it true that your brother gave those wings to a woman?

04:08:05.740 --> 04:08:10.740
Yes, it is. He's helping Snork to build the shed his payment.

04:08:10.740 --> 04:08:14.740
I thought they'd been broken up. They hit that tree very hard.

04:08:14.740 --> 04:08:16.740
Well, my brother's repairing them.

04:08:16.740 --> 04:08:19.740
Will you let me pass? I've got to take his lunch to him.

04:08:19.740 --> 04:08:22.740
And will he be able to repair them?

04:08:22.740 --> 04:08:25.740
He can repair anything.

04:08:26.740 --> 04:08:27.740
Mmm.

04:08:27.740 --> 04:08:30.740
Gosh, what a lot of wood you've got.

04:08:30.740 --> 04:08:34.740
Well, the shed has to be a lot bigger than my flying ship.

04:08:34.740 --> 04:08:37.740
Moomin and Moomin Papa are digging holes. They sure are deep.

04:08:37.740 --> 04:08:42.740
Everybody's being very kind, very kind indeed.

04:08:44.740 --> 04:08:48.740
Mama's cooking and Snuffkin's gone to get nails.

04:08:48.740 --> 04:08:51.740
There are some other things I need him to get as well.

04:08:51.740 --> 04:08:53.740
Will you write them down?

04:08:54.740 --> 04:08:57.740
Of course I will, Snork. Oh, you're such a planner.

04:08:57.740 --> 04:09:01.740
Well, I'm afraid all famous inventors have to be.

04:09:11.740 --> 04:09:13.740
Whether it was Snork's planning,

04:09:13.740 --> 04:09:17.740
or the fact that everyone in Moomin Valley helped in some way or other,

04:09:17.740 --> 04:09:21.740
the hanger or boat house was finished in a record time.

04:09:23.740 --> 04:09:25.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:25.740 --> 04:09:27.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:27.740 --> 04:09:29.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:29.740 --> 04:09:31.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:31.740 --> 04:09:33.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:33.740 --> 04:09:35.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:35.740 --> 04:09:37.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:37.740 --> 04:09:39.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:39.740 --> 04:09:41.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:41.740 --> 04:09:43.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:43.740 --> 04:09:45.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:45.740 --> 04:09:47.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:47.740 --> 04:09:49.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:49.740 --> 04:09:51.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:51.740 --> 04:09:53.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:53.740 --> 04:09:55.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:55.740 --> 04:09:57.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:57.740 --> 04:09:59.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:09:59.740 --> 04:10:01.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:10:01.740 --> 04:10:03.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:10:03.740 --> 04:10:05.740
I'm going to take a look.

04:10:05.740 --> 04:10:07.740
You?

04:10:07.740 --> 04:10:09.740
Moomin's here.

04:10:09.740 --> 04:10:11.740
Come in, Moomin.

04:10:11.740 --> 04:10:13.740
Thank you for all your help.

04:10:13.740 --> 04:10:17.740
You did so much that these wings are hardly paymented enough.

04:10:17.740 --> 04:10:19.740
But if you're happy with them.

04:10:19.740 --> 04:10:21.740
You make fun building the shed.

04:10:21.740 --> 04:10:25.740
I change the design a bit, so it's easier to take off on land.

04:10:25.740 --> 04:10:29.740
And turning shouldn't be a problem anymore.

04:10:29.740 --> 04:10:31.740
You must remember to give yourself plenty of time, Moomin.

04:10:31.740 --> 04:10:33.740
Thank you, Snork.

04:10:33.740 --> 04:10:35.740
I can't wait to try them out.

04:10:35.740 --> 04:10:37.740
I'm so excited I don't think I'll sleep tonight.

04:10:37.740 --> 04:10:39.740
Are you trying them out tomorrow?

04:10:39.740 --> 04:10:41.740
As soon as I can.

04:10:41.740 --> 04:10:43.740
You will be careful.

04:10:43.740 --> 04:10:45.740
You must practice a lot just above the ground to get used to

04:10:45.740 --> 04:10:47.740
wearing them before you try to go too high.

04:10:47.740 --> 04:10:50.360
I don't want anything to happen to you.

04:10:50.360 --> 04:10:52.200
Oh, practice, I promise.

04:10:58.200 --> 04:11:00.120
Where are you going to practice tomorrow?

04:11:00.120 --> 04:11:01.520
I haven't decided.

04:11:04.840 --> 04:11:07.320
I'll find somewhere when I come out tomorrow,

04:11:07.320 --> 04:11:09.880
perhaps on that small hill near the cliff.

04:11:09.880 --> 04:11:11.720
Well, that can't be too dangerous.

04:11:11.720 --> 04:11:12.720
I'll see you there.

04:11:47.740 --> 04:11:57.740
Hi, Momen. Where do you put the wings?

04:11:57.740 --> 04:12:09.740
On the table outside, you must have gone past them

04:12:09.740 --> 04:12:11.740
if you came in through the veranda door.

04:12:11.740 --> 04:12:15.740
No, I didn't. They're not there.

04:12:15.740 --> 04:12:17.740
What?

04:12:21.740 --> 04:12:25.740
Oh, no, you're right. They're gone.

04:12:25.740 --> 04:12:27.740
Oh dear, I thought it was mine.

04:12:27.740 --> 04:12:29.740
What's happened to them?

04:12:29.740 --> 04:12:30.740
Somebody stolen them.

04:12:30.740 --> 04:12:32.740
What's the matter with you, too?

04:12:32.740 --> 04:12:33.740
Is something wrong?

04:12:33.740 --> 04:12:36.740
Yes, somebody stolen Momen's wings.

04:12:36.740 --> 04:12:39.740
Well, perhaps they haven't been stolen.

04:12:39.740 --> 04:12:43.740
Of course they have, and I bet I know who did it, too.

04:12:43.740 --> 04:12:44.740
Come on.

04:12:44.740 --> 04:12:47.740
Where are we going? Do you know where they are?

04:12:55.740 --> 04:12:56.740
It's stinky.

04:12:56.740 --> 04:13:00.740
Oh, yeah. Well, it certainly didn't take you long.

04:13:00.740 --> 04:13:03.740
Just a minute, stinky. Those are my wings.

04:13:03.740 --> 04:13:05.740
See? I knew it was him.

04:13:09.740 --> 04:13:11.740
Stop, you horrible creature.

04:13:11.740 --> 04:13:13.740
I certainly will back.

04:13:13.740 --> 04:13:16.740
If you give them back, stinky, I'll let you try them out later.

04:13:16.740 --> 04:13:17.740
I promise.

04:13:17.740 --> 04:13:22.740
No way, boom. When they're mine now, I'm going to be a high flier.

04:13:22.740 --> 04:13:24.740
Look out, moving.

04:13:27.740 --> 04:13:28.740
Oh, stop!

04:13:28.740 --> 04:13:30.740
Oh, no.

04:13:30.740 --> 04:13:33.740
You're pathetic.

04:13:33.740 --> 04:13:35.740
The wings are mine.

04:13:35.740 --> 04:13:38.740
I'll become a master criminal now.

04:13:39.740 --> 04:13:42.740
All rotten seabing.

04:13:42.740 --> 04:13:45.740
You shouldn't have left them outside, Momen.

04:13:45.740 --> 04:13:48.740
Yeah, but who'd think let each steal them?

04:13:48.740 --> 04:13:49.740
Where his friends?

04:13:49.740 --> 04:13:50.740
Well, almost.

04:13:50.740 --> 04:13:53.740
I didn't think even stinky would do something like that.

04:13:53.740 --> 04:13:54.740
Well, he did, didn't he?

04:13:54.740 --> 04:13:56.740
Now, don't worry, Momen.

04:13:56.740 --> 04:13:59.740
We'll find him and get them back. I know it.

04:14:05.740 --> 04:14:07.740
Look, Momen, now he's going towards the sea.

04:14:09.740 --> 04:14:13.740
Oh, no, turn around.

04:14:13.740 --> 04:14:15.740
But stinky didn't know how to maneuver the wings.

04:14:15.740 --> 04:14:18.740
It must take him further and further out.

04:14:21.740 --> 04:14:24.740
Turn around, we'll get turned back.

04:14:24.740 --> 04:14:25.740
Until?

04:14:33.740 --> 04:14:35.740
You're at least he's having a bath for once.

04:14:35.740 --> 04:14:37.740
The wings will be badly damaged.

04:14:38.740 --> 04:14:39.740
Never mind.

04:14:39.740 --> 04:14:41.740
Snark will build another pair.

04:14:41.740 --> 04:14:43.740
I sure hope so.

04:15:08.740 --> 04:15:14.740
They love the laughter and they love the living.

04:15:14.740 --> 04:15:17.740
The movements.

04:15:17.740 --> 04:15:25.740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:15:25.740 --> 04:15:28.740
They're always happy and always at play.

04:15:28.740 --> 04:15:32.740
The movements are having fun day after day.

04:15:32.740 --> 04:15:35.740
The movements.

04:15:36.740 --> 04:15:40.740
The movements.

04:15:40.740 --> 04:15:43.740
They love the laughter and they love the living.

04:15:43.740 --> 04:15:47.740
The movements.

04:15:47.740 --> 04:15:54.740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:15:54.740 --> 04:15:58.740
They're always happy and always at play.

04:15:58.740 --> 04:16:02.740
The movements are having fun day after day.

04:16:02.740 --> 04:16:05.740
The movements.

04:16:05.740 --> 04:16:09.740
The movements.

04:16:09.740 --> 04:16:15.740
The movements.

04:16:33.740 --> 04:16:37.740
Here they are for one and all.

04:16:37.740 --> 04:16:40.740
The movements are about to come.

04:16:40.740 --> 04:16:43.740
Come on and sit down here with me.

04:16:43.740 --> 04:16:45.740
Therefore you are your TV.

04:16:45.740 --> 04:16:48.740
They are the movements.

04:16:48.740 --> 04:16:51.740
They are the movements.

04:16:51.740 --> 04:16:54.740
So come with me, give me your hand.

04:16:54.740 --> 04:16:57.740
I'll take you up to a movement land.

04:16:57.740 --> 04:17:00.740
You can fly just like a bird.

04:17:00.740 --> 04:17:03.740
Sing the best song ever.

04:17:03.740 --> 04:17:06.740
There were the movements.

04:17:06.740 --> 04:17:09.740
There were the movements.

04:17:09.740 --> 04:17:12.740
There were the movements.

04:17:12.740 --> 04:17:15.740
There were the movements.

04:17:15.740 --> 04:17:18.740
There were the movements.

04:17:18.740 --> 04:17:21.740
There were the movements.

04:17:30.740 --> 04:17:33.740
There were the movements.

04:17:33.740 --> 04:17:36.740
There were the movements.

04:17:36.740 --> 04:17:39.740
There were the movements.

04:17:39.740 --> 04:17:42.740
There were the movements.

04:17:42.740 --> 04:17:45.740
There were the movements.

04:17:45.740 --> 04:17:48.740
There were the movements.

04:17:48.740 --> 04:17:51.740
There were the movements.

04:17:51.740 --> 04:17:54.740
There were the movements.

04:17:54.740 --> 04:17:57.740
There were the movements.

04:17:57.740 --> 04:18:01.740
There were the movements.

04:18:01.740 --> 04:18:06.740
Captain Blood and his band of feared pirates had sailed the seas for many years,

04:18:06.740 --> 04:18:09.740
but never could he remember a storm such as this.

04:18:09.740 --> 04:18:15.740
He began to wonder whether his ship could withstand the battering and buffeting of the angry waves for much longer.

04:18:15.740 --> 04:18:21.740
Alas, he is now too late to launch the lifeboat, he thought, as he lashed himself to the wheel.

04:18:21.740 --> 04:18:24.740
His voice rose against the wind.

04:18:24.740 --> 04:18:30.740
The blood can think of no better death than to journey to the bottom of the sea, losing the last battle against his old adversary.

04:18:30.740 --> 04:18:34.740
But if only I could see the life of the young and beautiful princess,

04:18:34.740 --> 04:18:37.740
who I rescued from the Duke scallion before a ciker.

04:18:37.740 --> 04:18:41.740
I care not about the three chests of doubloons, two chests of jewels,

04:18:41.740 --> 04:18:45.740
and 36 bales of the richest and most colorful silks.

04:18:45.740 --> 04:18:49.740
But oh, must she too perish in this terrible storm.

04:18:49.740 --> 04:18:51.740
Did a good book, Moomin?

04:18:51.740 --> 04:18:54.740
Mmm, it's great.

04:18:54.740 --> 04:18:57.740
What a terrible storm, it's not easing at all.

04:18:57.740 --> 04:18:58.740
No.

04:18:58.740 --> 04:19:01.740
I'm so glad I'm not on my own in a night like this.

04:19:01.740 --> 04:19:04.740
I feel safe in Moomin house.

04:19:04.740 --> 04:19:06.740
Oh, what was that?

04:19:06.740 --> 04:19:09.740
It sounded like a tree breaking.

04:19:09.740 --> 04:19:10.740
Hey, Moomin.

04:19:10.740 --> 04:19:13.740
Mmm, why don't you read your story out loud?

04:19:13.740 --> 04:19:14.740
Oh, okay.

04:19:14.740 --> 04:19:16.740
But can I start where I got to?

04:19:16.740 --> 04:19:19.740
As long as you tell us what's happened before, we won't know what it's about.

04:19:19.740 --> 04:19:21.740
And we might have missed something important.

04:19:21.740 --> 04:19:23.740
Just the main points will do, Moomin.

04:19:23.740 --> 04:19:25.740
Well, there's this brave part.

04:19:25.740 --> 04:19:27.740
Oh, it's so much fun when someone reads out loud.

04:19:27.740 --> 04:19:29.740
Go on, Moomin.

04:19:29.740 --> 04:19:30.740
Captain Blood.

04:19:30.740 --> 04:19:34.740
And he and his men have captured a rich and royal galleon.

04:19:34.740 --> 04:19:38.740
They've taken lots of gold, silver, and jewels and things.

04:19:38.740 --> 04:19:40.740
And oh, yes, a princess, too.

04:19:40.740 --> 04:19:42.740
It's exciting, isn't it?

04:19:42.740 --> 04:19:44.740
Yes, it is.

04:19:45.740 --> 04:19:51.740
The storm that rose that night was so violent that at first,

04:19:51.740 --> 04:19:56.740
it seemed inevitable the ship found before the waves had engulfed it.

04:19:56.740 --> 04:19:59.740
Not bad, if I say so myself.

04:19:59.740 --> 04:20:03.740
Captain Blood saw that the poor princess had indeed swooned.

04:20:03.740 --> 04:20:09.740
With only the rats for company, how frightened she must have been down in the old.

04:20:09.740 --> 04:20:13.740
The noise of the storm was deafening as the ship was thrown above.

04:20:14.740 --> 04:20:16.740
Under swirling sea.

04:20:16.740 --> 04:20:19.740
The captain's brave heart went out to his young and beautiful captain.

04:20:19.740 --> 04:20:21.740
Would I have some tea, Mama?

04:20:21.740 --> 04:20:23.740
Of course, dear. Would you like me to bring it up to you?

04:20:23.740 --> 04:20:25.740
No, thanks. I've finished for the day.

04:20:25.740 --> 04:20:28.740
That's good. Shall we all have some tea and lemonade?

04:20:28.740 --> 04:20:31.740
Yes, please. I'm very thirsty.

04:20:31.740 --> 04:20:33.740
You read very well. Thank you, Moomin.

04:20:33.740 --> 04:20:35.740
Great story, isn't it?

04:20:35.740 --> 04:20:37.740
Could I have some strawberry juice, please, Mama?

04:20:37.740 --> 04:20:40.740
It's not made, and when is your brother coming home?

04:20:40.740 --> 04:20:44.740
He didn't say exactly, but in a couple of days, I should think.

04:20:44.740 --> 04:20:49.740
It was a good idea to let snort-making stay while he was away, wasn't it, Papa?

04:20:49.740 --> 04:20:55.740
Yes, it wouldn't be very nice to be all on your own at night in a storm like this.

04:20:55.740 --> 04:20:57.740
Not at all.

04:21:11.740 --> 04:21:13.740
She seems to be sinking.

04:21:13.740 --> 04:21:15.740
She won't be able to hold out much longer.

04:21:15.740 --> 04:21:18.740
We must get to the crew without delay.

04:21:18.740 --> 04:21:20.740
How could we launch a boat in this weather?

04:21:20.740 --> 04:21:22.740
Any survivors?

04:21:22.740 --> 04:21:25.740
We haven't found anyone yet.

04:21:25.740 --> 04:21:28.740
So what about further along the coast?

04:21:28.740 --> 04:21:30.740
Any reports of survivors turning up?

04:21:30.740 --> 04:21:33.740
No, I'm afraid not, Inspector. We haven't heard anything.

04:21:33.740 --> 04:21:35.740
Well, tell me if you do.

04:21:35.740 --> 04:21:37.740
Ah, Inspector.

04:21:37.740 --> 04:21:38.740
Yes?

04:21:38.740 --> 04:21:41.740
Ah, it seems to me it was a pirate ship that sunk.

04:21:41.740 --> 04:21:43.740
What did you say?

04:21:43.740 --> 04:21:48.740
Well, I'm pretty sure I saw the skull and crossbones flying from the mast.

04:21:48.740 --> 04:21:52.740
And I think I caught sight of a cannon, but I could have been mistaken.

04:21:52.740 --> 04:21:53.740
You must be joking.

04:21:53.740 --> 04:21:54.740
I never joke.

04:21:54.740 --> 04:22:00.740
I can't see anything. It's too far away to make out any sort of skull and crossbones.

04:22:00.740 --> 04:22:01.740
Try this.

04:22:01.740 --> 04:22:03.740
Ah, you've got a telescope.

04:22:03.740 --> 04:22:06.740
Now why didn't you let me have this before? It might have helped.

04:22:07.740 --> 04:22:08.740
Oh!

04:22:22.740 --> 04:22:24.740
Ah, that's it. She's gone.

04:22:30.740 --> 04:22:33.740
I suppose that there aren't many pirate ships around today.

04:22:33.740 --> 04:22:38.740
Any that are afloat must be so old that they'd probably break up easily.

04:22:38.740 --> 04:22:42.740
That's if it was a pirate ship, but it sure looked like one right enough.

04:22:42.740 --> 04:22:45.740
Nothing's been washed up on the shore yet?

04:22:45.740 --> 04:22:47.740
No, not a thing.

04:22:50.740 --> 04:22:54.740
Isn't it strange that I was reading that book about pirates yesterday?

04:22:54.740 --> 04:22:57.740
They probably wouldn't be quite so romantic in real life.

04:22:57.740 --> 04:23:01.740
Well, in the book they were really great. I wish I'd been one.

04:23:01.740 --> 04:23:02.740
A pirate?

04:23:02.740 --> 04:23:04.740
Yeah, what could be more exciting?

04:23:04.740 --> 04:23:06.740
You can't mean that.

04:23:06.740 --> 04:23:12.740
Oh yes, I do. To sail across the seven seas, the holds of your ship's crammed with treasurers.

04:23:12.740 --> 04:23:16.740
But you'd have to steal the treasure from somebody first, though, movement.

04:23:16.740 --> 04:23:22.740
Well, yes, alright. I suppose so. But I wouldn't steal anything from anyone.

04:23:22.740 --> 04:23:26.740
Ah, then you're just a sailor. Not a pirate at all.

04:23:26.740 --> 04:23:33.740
Boom and mama, do you know where Moomin is?

04:23:33.740 --> 04:23:36.740
He's probably in Snuffkin's tent.

04:23:36.740 --> 04:23:37.740
Oh, yeah?

04:23:37.740 --> 04:23:40.740
Snork maiden, I have a letter for you.

04:23:40.740 --> 04:23:43.740
Yeah, you are. It's from the snork.

04:23:43.740 --> 04:23:48.740
Oh, thank you. Wait a minute, little my. I want to read Snork's letter.

04:23:48.740 --> 04:23:50.740
Take your time.

04:23:57.740 --> 04:24:00.740
Oh, what's the matter?

04:24:00.740 --> 04:24:03.740
It's Snork. He's coming home today.

04:24:03.740 --> 04:24:04.740
That's nice.

04:24:04.740 --> 04:24:07.740
But Moomin, mama, there's no food in the house at all.

04:24:07.740 --> 04:24:10.740
Now, don't worry about that, Snork maiden.

04:24:10.740 --> 04:24:14.740
I'll rustle up some dinner for us, and Snork can tell us all about his trip.

04:24:14.740 --> 04:24:15.740
Boom and Papa like that.

04:24:15.740 --> 04:24:19.740
Oh, thank you, mama. Snork doesn't like missing his meals.

04:24:19.740 --> 04:24:22.740
He must have got the part sooner than he thought.

04:24:22.740 --> 04:24:24.740
Ha, that's great news.

04:24:24.740 --> 04:24:26.740
He should finish his flying ship soon, hey?

04:24:26.740 --> 04:24:28.740
I guess so.

04:24:28.740 --> 04:24:31.740
He should make it into a pirate flying ship.

04:24:31.740 --> 04:24:36.740
I could be his first maid, and no one would be able to catch us. Nobody at all.

04:24:36.740 --> 04:24:39.740
Ha, ha, ha.

04:24:39.740 --> 04:24:41.740
Not here.

04:24:41.740 --> 04:24:44.740
Oh, dear. I wonder where they've gone, little my.

04:24:44.740 --> 04:24:47.740
There's nobody here.

04:24:47.740 --> 04:24:50.740
Moomin probably wanted to go looking for an adventure.

04:24:50.740 --> 04:24:54.740
I bet they went down to the beach to see if anything's been washed out.

04:24:54.740 --> 04:24:56.740
At least the hangar's not been damaged.

04:24:56.740 --> 04:25:00.740
Let's go down to the beach. We may find a treasure chest.

04:25:00.740 --> 04:25:03.740
Huh?

04:25:05.740 --> 04:25:07.740
What is it?

04:25:07.740 --> 04:25:09.740
I just thought I heard something.

04:25:09.740 --> 04:25:11.740
Where? From in there.

04:25:11.740 --> 04:25:13.740
Hmm, weird.

04:25:13.740 --> 04:25:16.740
Oh, I know. The snork must have come back.

04:25:16.740 --> 04:25:19.740
Oh, yes. Snork. Of course.

04:25:20.740 --> 04:25:23.740
Hello, snork.

04:25:23.740 --> 04:25:26.740
Oh, snork. Are you in here?

04:25:26.740 --> 04:25:28.740
Mm-hmm.

04:25:28.740 --> 04:25:30.740
Ah!

04:25:32.740 --> 04:25:35.740
Snork me.

04:25:35.740 --> 04:25:37.740
Huh?

04:25:41.740 --> 04:25:45.740
Put her down.

04:25:45.740 --> 04:25:48.740
Oh, really? It was actually a pirate ship.

04:25:48.740 --> 04:25:53.740
It was indeed Moomin Papa, and we caught the pirates when they swam ashore.

04:25:53.740 --> 04:25:56.740
Do you think you captured all of them, Inspector?

04:25:56.740 --> 04:26:00.740
Well, of course, we don't know exactly how many there were to begin with.

04:26:00.740 --> 04:26:06.740
Hmm, right. I better barricade ourselves in Moomin House just to be on the safe side.

04:26:06.740 --> 04:26:12.740
Oh, dear. And I suppose I ought to stand guard over my greenhouse as well.

04:26:13.740 --> 04:26:18.740
Blast me, beansoles. Come here, you little pineapple.

04:26:18.740 --> 04:26:22.740
Do let snork me go. You'll be sorry. You great big hairy folly.

04:26:22.740 --> 04:26:27.740
No, not in your life. That won't just my hostage. I needed to make good my escape, but go.

04:26:27.740 --> 04:26:30.740
Then you only have yourself to blame.

04:26:30.740 --> 04:26:36.740
Hey, what? Blame? Stay where you are now. I will not be bitten again. Keep away a little cat.

04:26:36.740 --> 04:26:38.740
Well, don't hurt her then.

04:26:39.740 --> 04:26:44.740
Hurt her, you little shark. She's a hostage. Come me one at that. She'll be my safe passenger.

04:26:44.740 --> 04:26:46.740
These rough waters are perished.

04:26:46.740 --> 04:26:50.740
Well, then you better take me instead, because I'm much easier to carry.

04:26:50.740 --> 04:26:54.740
You, huh? Nobody would care if I fed you slowly to the shrimps.

04:26:54.740 --> 04:26:58.740
Oh, yes, lots of people. When you overstab win, babe.

04:26:58.740 --> 04:27:02.740
All right, all right. Hold your head. We'd blow me down. No, what's your name, girl?

04:27:02.740 --> 04:27:04.740
I'm Lil Mai.

04:27:04.740 --> 04:27:08.740
I'm Captain Rumpod. Not going to get whatever authorities you have in this backwater.

04:27:08.740 --> 04:27:10.740
Hurry, my patience is short.

04:27:10.740 --> 04:27:14.740
I'll only go if you promise that you won't hurt snork maiden.

04:27:14.740 --> 04:27:16.740
Of course I won't.

04:27:16.740 --> 04:27:20.740
If I find that you've hurt her in any way at all, my revenge will be terrible.

04:27:20.740 --> 04:27:23.740
All right, all right, all right.

04:27:35.740 --> 04:27:39.740
Oh, boy.

04:27:50.740 --> 04:27:56.740
Captain Rumpod, you are surrounded. Let snork maiden go. Do you hear me, Captain?

04:27:56.740 --> 04:28:03.740
Do a gold button land lover like you never. She's a good-looking wench fair skinned and nicely rounded.

04:28:03.740 --> 04:28:08.740
Pirates prefer blondes. Give me a ship and you can have her back.

04:28:08.740 --> 04:28:11.740
What do you say to that, my buckhole?

04:28:11.740 --> 04:28:16.740
You're on your own, Captain. We've got all your men locked up tight.

04:28:16.740 --> 04:28:18.740
All me crew?

04:28:18.740 --> 04:28:22.740
You're the last one. Now, let her go immediately.

04:28:22.740 --> 04:28:26.740
Thank you for saving me crew. I feared they were all lost.

04:28:26.740 --> 04:28:29.740
Don't thank me. They're all in jail.

04:28:29.740 --> 04:28:33.740
Ah, someone said it's the best place for them, but not me.

04:28:33.740 --> 04:28:36.740
Now let them out. I need them and a proper ship.

04:28:36.740 --> 04:28:42.740
Oh, with two masks and fifty cannon and no tricks else it'll be worse for the girl.

04:28:43.740 --> 04:28:46.740
This is too much.

04:28:46.740 --> 04:28:49.740
The school for constables didn't tell us about this.

04:28:49.740 --> 04:28:52.740
What should we do, Inspector?

04:28:54.740 --> 04:28:56.740
Police gets snorked making away from him.

04:28:56.740 --> 04:28:58.740
I'm afraid you'll hurt her and she'll be frightened.

04:28:58.740 --> 04:29:01.740
I'm trying my best, but it's very awkward all this.

04:29:01.740 --> 04:29:04.740
I've not come across anything like it before.

04:29:04.740 --> 04:29:07.740
Oh, but it's not her fault that his ship sank, Inspector.

04:29:07.740 --> 04:29:10.740
I know, I know. Oh, dear, oh dear.

04:29:10.740 --> 04:29:13.740
Oh, I should have been a gardener.

04:29:13.740 --> 04:29:16.740
Hey, are you still there, you ruffian?

04:29:16.740 --> 04:29:21.740
Let my men go and get my ship. Two masks and fifty cannon mines.

04:29:21.740 --> 04:29:25.740
Look, Captain Rumpod, I'm afraid the times have changed.

04:29:25.740 --> 04:29:28.740
Sailing ships don't have cannon these days.

04:29:28.740 --> 04:29:31.740
Shiver me timbers. How do you sink each other then?

04:29:31.740 --> 04:29:34.740
I don't try to fool me. Remember, I've got the girl.

04:29:34.740 --> 04:29:38.740
I think Moomin Papa has an old blender bus I'm sure he'll let you have.

04:29:38.740 --> 04:29:41.740
I don't know if it'll work, though. That's all I've got.

04:29:41.740 --> 04:29:45.740
I'm one of you, Peabrain. This is my final word, so listen well.

04:29:45.740 --> 04:29:50.740
You have two hours to get the ship ready to sail and all my crew with her mine.

04:29:50.740 --> 04:29:52.740
Or else I'll...

04:29:52.740 --> 04:29:55.740
Now, don't worry, my pretty one. I won't have a single hair on your head,

04:29:55.740 --> 04:29:58.740
but I must have something to threaten them with.

04:29:58.740 --> 04:30:03.740
Or else I'll feed her to the hungry shark.

04:30:03.740 --> 04:30:06.740
Oscar, I won't hurt you.

04:30:06.740 --> 04:30:07.740
Are you sure?

04:30:07.740 --> 04:30:11.740
Either I get my ship, Oak, fifty cannon, and at least two masters.

04:30:11.740 --> 04:30:15.740
She'll be food for lobsters. It's your choice, my husband.

04:30:15.740 --> 04:30:17.740
That should do it.

04:30:19.740 --> 04:30:21.740
He sounds as if he'll do it, too.

04:30:21.740 --> 04:30:26.740
Two hours, he says, a real feeder to the shark. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

04:30:26.740 --> 04:30:30.740
What will Snork say, oh, dear, oh, dear?

04:30:32.740 --> 04:30:34.740
I have a great idea, sir.

04:30:34.740 --> 04:30:38.740
Why don't we climb onto the roof, drill a hole, and then drop something on his head?

04:30:38.740 --> 04:30:43.740
You know, Constable, I've always thought you were an idiot, and now you've proved it.

04:30:43.740 --> 04:30:45.740
Excuse me, Inspector.

04:30:45.740 --> 04:30:49.740
If we set fire to the hangar, then they'll have to come out, won't they?

04:30:49.740 --> 04:30:53.740
Shut up! Why am I surrounded by fools?

04:30:53.740 --> 04:30:55.740
Oh, this is no good.

04:30:55.740 --> 04:30:59.740
I must calm down, I must calm down.

04:30:59.740 --> 04:31:01.740
Captain Rumbot!

04:31:01.740 --> 04:31:03.740
Can you hear me, Captain?

04:31:03.740 --> 04:31:06.740
Aha, you found a ship already, have you?

04:31:06.740 --> 04:31:10.740
Well, no, there aren't any real sailing ships in Moomin Valley.

04:31:10.740 --> 04:31:12.740
The chief Constable has a yacht.

04:31:12.740 --> 04:31:16.740
He doesn't usually let anyone borrow it, but I'm sure in this case he...

04:31:16.740 --> 04:31:20.740
I want something big enough to take me to the Spanish main, I warn you!

04:31:20.740 --> 04:31:24.740
To calm down, Captain, calm down, now just listen to me.

04:31:24.740 --> 04:31:28.740
You haven't done anything wrong here, no pirating or such like,

04:31:28.740 --> 04:31:32.740
so if you forget about the boat, we'll let you all go, think about it.

04:31:32.740 --> 04:31:35.740
Three to go anywhere you like, on foot, of course.

04:31:35.740 --> 04:31:41.740
The fresh air, the sun on your face, no worry of shipwrecks, no storms at sea.

04:31:41.740 --> 04:31:43.740
What do you think we are?

04:31:43.740 --> 04:31:45.740
Huh, we're pirates, not high-wamen.

04:31:45.740 --> 04:31:48.740
It's not so bad being a high-wamen, you know?

04:31:48.740 --> 04:31:51.740
There'll be lots of rich travelers on the other side of Lonely Mountain,

04:31:51.740 --> 04:31:54.740
I'm sure, and lots of adventures with jewels and gold.

04:31:54.740 --> 04:31:58.740
Day me with flagens are rubbed your chicken brain, nitwit!

04:31:58.740 --> 04:31:59.740
Nitwit?

04:31:59.740 --> 04:32:01.740
No, niggum poop, dumb bill!

04:32:01.740 --> 04:32:02.740
I'm Captain Rumbot!

04:32:02.740 --> 04:32:04.740
You're making me very angry!

04:32:04.740 --> 04:32:07.740
If I had you on my ship, you'd dangle from the yard!

04:32:07.740 --> 04:32:09.740
I'm yet to walk the blade!

04:32:09.740 --> 04:32:11.740
The inspectors lose control.

04:32:11.740 --> 04:32:13.740
We had better calm him down.

04:32:14.740 --> 04:32:16.740
What the crank would I?

04:32:16.740 --> 04:32:19.740
And in my prison, you'd get no butter in their bread,

04:32:19.740 --> 04:32:21.740
and maggots on your biscuits!

04:32:22.740 --> 04:32:23.740
Please calm down, sister.

04:32:23.740 --> 04:32:24.740
Please calm down, sister.

04:32:24.740 --> 04:32:25.740
Calm down.

04:32:25.740 --> 04:32:26.740
Calm down, take care.

04:32:26.740 --> 04:32:27.740
Be easy.

04:32:27.740 --> 04:32:28.740
Are you sure?

04:32:28.740 --> 04:32:29.740
We water!

04:32:29.740 --> 04:32:32.740
I'd see through it that the bread was milled!

04:32:37.740 --> 04:32:40.740
That's 30 minutes gone already!

04:32:44.740 --> 04:32:46.740
I warned you, gold button.

04:32:46.740 --> 04:32:49.740
Now there is only one hour to her painful and horrible death!

04:32:52.740 --> 04:32:54.740
Cheer up, Snark Maiden!

04:32:54.740 --> 04:32:56.740
Try and hold on!

04:32:56.740 --> 04:32:58.740
We'll get you out!

04:32:58.740 --> 04:32:59.740
Water?

04:32:59.740 --> 04:33:00.740
Water?

04:33:00.740 --> 04:33:01.740
Huh?

04:33:01.740 --> 04:33:02.740
What did you say?

04:33:02.740 --> 04:33:03.740
Water, please.

04:33:03.740 --> 04:33:05.740
I'm so thirsty.

04:33:05.740 --> 04:33:06.740
Water?

04:33:06.740 --> 04:33:07.740
Nasty?

04:33:07.740 --> 04:33:08.740
I'm thirsty.

04:33:08.740 --> 04:33:09.740
Water?

04:33:09.740 --> 04:33:10.740
Nasty?

04:33:10.740 --> 04:33:11.740
I'm thirsty.

04:33:11.740 --> 04:33:12.740
Water?

04:33:12.740 --> 04:33:14.740
Nasty stuff, still.

04:33:15.740 --> 04:33:17.740
Hey, land lovers!

04:33:17.740 --> 04:33:18.740
Compliments to the galley!

04:33:18.740 --> 04:33:20.740
The young lady wants a drink!

04:33:20.740 --> 04:33:21.740
All right, captain.

04:33:21.740 --> 04:33:23.740
I'm coming, Snark Maiden.

04:33:24.740 --> 04:33:25.740
I'll take it, Inspector.

04:33:25.740 --> 04:33:27.740
It's too dangerous.

04:33:27.740 --> 04:33:29.740
You must leave it to us now, moment.

04:33:29.740 --> 04:33:31.740
Just a minute, Inspector.

04:33:31.740 --> 04:33:33.740
I think we should let Moomin go,

04:33:33.740 --> 04:33:35.740
and I've got an idea that just might work.

04:33:35.740 --> 04:33:36.740
Snark him!

04:33:37.740 --> 04:33:38.740
It'll take an awful lot of courage,

04:33:38.740 --> 04:33:40.740
and you'll have to do it all on your own.

04:33:40.740 --> 04:33:42.740
Do you think you can do it, Moomin?

04:33:42.740 --> 04:33:43.740
Of course.

04:33:48.740 --> 04:33:49.740
Splice me, mate.

04:33:49.740 --> 04:33:51.740
Raise what's taken him so long.

04:33:51.740 --> 04:33:53.740
Keep it a young lady in waiting.

04:33:53.740 --> 04:33:54.740
It's all right.

04:33:54.740 --> 04:33:56.740
I really don't mind waiting.

04:33:56.740 --> 04:33:57.740
Tell you the truth.

04:33:57.740 --> 04:33:59.740
I can do it and drink myself.

04:33:59.740 --> 04:34:00.740
It's thirsty work.

04:34:00.740 --> 04:34:01.740
Shouting at idiot policeman.

04:34:01.740 --> 04:34:02.740
Don't you worry, little one.

04:34:02.740 --> 04:34:04.740
They'll be here soon.

04:34:05.740 --> 04:34:07.740
Get me a drink, too!

04:34:07.740 --> 04:34:08.740
You hear it!

04:34:08.740 --> 04:34:09.740
Quick about it!

04:34:09.740 --> 04:34:12.740
I've brought you something to drink, Captain.

04:34:13.740 --> 04:34:15.740
Right, come on, then.

04:34:15.740 --> 04:34:17.740
And no funny stuff.

04:34:17.740 --> 04:34:19.740
Don't worry. I'm on my own.

04:34:20.740 --> 04:34:22.740
Have you done a drink for me, too?

04:34:22.740 --> 04:34:23.740
Yes, Captain.

04:34:23.740 --> 04:34:26.740
All right. Stay there and put down the train.

04:34:28.740 --> 04:34:30.740
The bigger one is for you, Captain.

04:34:30.740 --> 04:34:32.740
And the little one for Snark, mate.

04:34:32.740 --> 04:34:34.740
Now move away.

04:34:35.740 --> 04:34:37.740
And for enough, stay there.

04:34:40.740 --> 04:34:43.740
Hmm. Why is it so red?

04:34:44.740 --> 04:34:46.740
Well, it's strawberry juice.

04:34:46.740 --> 04:34:48.740
It's very good.

04:34:52.740 --> 04:34:53.740
I'll be polite.

04:34:53.740 --> 04:34:56.740
She can drink from this one and I'll have hers.

04:34:56.740 --> 04:34:59.740
But, Captain, there's not enough for you in the small one.

04:35:00.740 --> 04:35:03.740
Strawberry juice isn't exactly my favorite tip of your know.

04:35:03.740 --> 04:35:05.740
No, the small one will do.

04:35:06.740 --> 04:35:08.740
Here you are, young lady.

04:35:09.740 --> 04:35:12.740
No, no, Snark, mate. And please, don't drink it.

04:35:13.740 --> 04:35:16.740
Why not, my young bucko? It's not poison, is it?

04:35:16.740 --> 04:35:18.740
Don't be silly. Poisoned.

04:35:18.740 --> 04:35:19.740
Oh, no, no.

04:35:19.740 --> 04:35:21.740
Perhaps a sleeping potion.

04:35:23.740 --> 04:35:25.740
Hmm. As I thought.

04:35:25.740 --> 04:35:29.740
I deemed in mighty strange that two cups were prepared.

04:35:29.740 --> 04:35:30.740
You drink it.

04:35:30.740 --> 04:35:33.740
Oh, no, no, no, sir. I'm not thirsty at all.

04:35:34.740 --> 04:35:37.740
What's the matter, Miland? You said the drink wasn't poisoned, didn't you?

04:35:38.740 --> 04:35:39.740
So, drink!

04:35:39.740 --> 04:35:40.740
Movement?

04:35:40.740 --> 04:35:42.740
Ah, you're her swing, are you?

04:35:43.740 --> 04:35:45.740
I shall never understand women anyway.

04:35:45.740 --> 04:35:48.740
One of you will have to drink it, and now!

04:35:49.740 --> 04:35:52.740
Not far, I'll do it. I'll do it. Give it to me.

04:35:52.740 --> 04:35:56.740
No, movement, don't. There's something in it. You'll be poisoned.

04:35:56.740 --> 04:35:59.740
It's all right, Snark, mate. It's nothing dangerous.

04:35:59.740 --> 04:36:01.740
Don't worry about me.

04:36:01.740 --> 04:36:02.740
I'll drink it.

04:36:03.740 --> 04:36:05.740
Oh.

04:36:05.740 --> 04:36:08.740
That's it. Drink up again.

04:36:12.740 --> 04:36:14.740
Down the hatch, Miland.

04:36:16.740 --> 04:36:18.740
You're lucky it wasn't poisoned.

04:36:19.740 --> 04:36:20.740
Yeah.

04:36:21.740 --> 04:36:23.740
And no sleeping potion, neither?

04:36:23.740 --> 04:36:27.740
Oh, no. Nothing at all. Nothing.

04:36:28.740 --> 04:36:32.740
Oh, movement! Oh, no, movement!

04:36:32.740 --> 04:36:34.740
You're not my pretty one.

04:36:34.740 --> 04:36:39.740
Your wimpy little bow is just taking a nap. You'll be right as rain's soon.

04:36:43.740 --> 04:36:45.740
And he thought he could fool me.

04:36:45.740 --> 04:36:48.740
Me, Captain Rumpot, but she can't.

04:36:48.740 --> 04:36:50.740
Well, I'll have the other one.

04:36:54.740 --> 04:36:55.740
Not bad.

04:36:56.740 --> 04:36:58.740
No, I'm sorry, young lady.

04:36:58.740 --> 04:37:00.740
They'll have to bring you another.

04:37:00.740 --> 04:37:03.740
Shall we order one without the draft?

04:37:03.740 --> 04:37:06.740
They'll be surprised when they see me still on my pins.

04:37:07.740 --> 04:37:10.740
Why do I not sleep at all?

04:37:12.740 --> 04:37:14.740
Let's go and give my surprise, huh?

04:37:15.740 --> 04:37:16.740
Oh.

04:37:17.740 --> 04:37:18.740
Oh.

04:37:22.740 --> 04:37:23.740
Oh.

04:37:23.740 --> 04:37:25.740
Yay!

04:37:27.740 --> 04:37:29.740
A moment!

04:37:29.740 --> 04:37:32.740
It's all right. I'm okay, Snorgmaiden.

04:37:32.740 --> 04:37:35.740
There's nothing in this drink. Would you like some?

04:37:35.740 --> 04:37:37.740
A moment. You mean you?

04:37:37.740 --> 04:37:40.740
Well, I was pretending. So I convinced you too, huh?

04:37:40.740 --> 04:37:42.740
A moment!

04:37:47.740 --> 04:37:51.740
Captain Rumpot didn't wake up that day, or the next.

04:37:51.740 --> 04:37:56.740
And when he did, he had a terrible headache, which served him right.

04:38:03.740 --> 04:38:06.740
The inspector let all the pirates go after a week.

04:38:06.740 --> 04:38:09.740
Well, they hadn't done any pirating in Moomin Valley,

04:38:09.740 --> 04:38:13.740
and wouldn't be doing any either, not without a ship.

04:38:16.740 --> 04:38:17.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:17.740 --> 04:38:18.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:18.740 --> 04:38:19.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:19.740 --> 04:38:20.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:20.740 --> 04:38:21.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:21.740 --> 04:38:22.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:22.740 --> 04:38:23.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:23.740 --> 04:38:24.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:24.740 --> 04:38:25.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:25.740 --> 04:38:26.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:26.740 --> 04:38:27.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:27.740 --> 04:38:28.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:28.740 --> 04:38:29.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:29.740 --> 04:38:30.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:30.740 --> 04:38:31.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:31.740 --> 04:38:32.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:32.740 --> 04:38:33.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:33.740 --> 04:38:34.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:34.740 --> 04:38:35.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:35.740 --> 04:38:36.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:36.740 --> 04:38:37.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:37.740 --> 04:38:38.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:38.740 --> 04:38:39.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:39.740 --> 04:38:40.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:40.740 --> 04:38:41.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:41.740 --> 04:38:42.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:42.740 --> 04:38:43.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:43.740 --> 04:38:44.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:44.740 --> 04:38:45.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:45.740 --> 04:38:46.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:46.740 --> 04:38:47.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:47.740 --> 04:38:48.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:48.740 --> 04:38:49.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:49.740 --> 04:38:50.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:50.740 --> 04:38:51.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:51.740 --> 04:38:52.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:52.740 --> 04:38:53.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:53.740 --> 04:38:54.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:54.740 --> 04:38:55.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:55.740 --> 04:38:56.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:56.740 --> 04:38:57.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:57.740 --> 04:38:58.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:58.740 --> 04:38:59.740
I'm sorry.

04:38:59.740 --> 04:39:00.740
I'm sorry.

04:39:00.740 --> 04:39:01.740
I'm sorry.

04:39:01.740 --> 04:39:02.740
I'm sorry.

04:39:02.740 --> 04:39:03.740
I'm sorry.

04:39:03.740 --> 04:39:04.740
I'm sorry.

04:39:04.740 --> 04:39:05.740
I'm sorry.

04:39:05.740 --> 04:39:06.740
I'm sorry.

04:39:06.740 --> 04:39:07.740
I'm sorry.

04:39:07.740 --> 04:39:08.740
I'm sorry.

04:39:08.740 --> 04:39:09.740
I'm sorry.

04:39:09.740 --> 04:39:10.740
I'm sorry.

04:40:51.740 --> 04:40:52.740
I'm sorry.

04:40:52.740 --> 04:40:53.740
I'm sorry.

04:40:53.740 --> 04:40:54.740
I'm sorry.

04:40:54.740 --> 04:40:55.740
I'm sorry.

04:40:55.740 --> 04:40:56.740
I'm sorry.

04:40:56.740 --> 04:40:57.740
I'm sorry.

04:40:57.740 --> 04:40:58.740
I'm sorry.

04:40:58.740 --> 04:40:59.740
I'm sorry.

04:40:59.740 --> 04:41:00.740
I'm sorry.

04:41:00.740 --> 04:41:01.740
I'm sorry.

04:41:01.740 --> 04:41:02.740
I'm sorry.

04:41:02.740 --> 04:41:03.740
I'm sorry.

04:41:03.740 --> 04:41:04.740
I'm sorry.

04:41:04.740 --> 04:41:05.740
I'm sorry.

04:41:05.740 --> 04:41:06.740
I'm sorry.

04:41:06.740 --> 04:41:14.740
I'm sorry.

04:41:14.740 --> 04:41:26.740
The rain was falling on movement value as though the heavens had decided to empty themselves.

04:41:26.740 --> 04:41:35.740
It was the whitest weather that anyone could remember.

04:41:35.740 --> 04:41:41.740
...

04:41:41.740 --> 04:41:47.740
...

04:41:47.740 --> 04:41:53.740
...

04:41:53.740 --> 04:41:59.740
...

04:41:59.740 --> 04:42:04.740
...

04:42:04.740 --> 04:42:12.740
...

04:42:12.740 --> 04:42:14.740
Mama, can I borrow all this?

04:42:14.740 --> 04:42:21.740
Of course, dear.

04:42:21.740 --> 04:42:23.740
And this one too?

04:42:23.740 --> 04:42:25.740
Yes, dear, but what do you need them for?

04:42:25.740 --> 04:42:26.740
It's a secret.

04:42:26.740 --> 04:42:27.740
A secret?

04:42:27.740 --> 04:42:28.740
Yeah, sure.

04:42:28.740 --> 04:42:31.740
I'll want to see a back moment, but you can keep the jar if you like.

04:42:31.740 --> 04:42:33.740
Thanks.

04:42:34.740 --> 04:42:44.740
...

04:42:44.740 --> 04:42:52.740
...

04:42:52.740 --> 04:42:55.740
Oh, dear me!

04:42:55.740 --> 04:42:58.740
Oh, there are puddles everywhere.

04:42:58.740 --> 04:43:00.740
Oh, dear me, Mr. Hamillin.

04:43:00.740 --> 04:43:01.740
What a mess!

04:43:01.740 --> 04:43:03.740
Hello, Mr. Hamillin.

04:43:03.740 --> 04:43:08.740
Oh, good morning, Momen.

04:43:08.740 --> 04:43:11.740
Oh, it's all misty now.

04:43:11.740 --> 04:43:13.740
What are you doing, Momen?

04:43:13.740 --> 04:43:15.740
Observing very closely.

04:43:15.740 --> 04:43:17.740
Oh, splendid, my boy.

04:43:17.740 --> 04:43:19.740
I'm glad you find botany so excited.
