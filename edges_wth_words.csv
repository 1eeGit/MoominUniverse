3,1,I can't help it if I'm happy.
4,3,"So yeah, woke me."
1,4,"Yes, it's all fresh, the flowers are out and the sun is shining, so I like being asleep."
4,1,You said you wanted to be a welcome as soon as spring was here.
2,4,Wouldn't it be quicker to use the stairs?
4,2,"Yes, thanks very much for letting me spend the winter here."
2,4,"Don't think your sister will be back yet, though."
5,2,"Like what, Momen?"
1,5,I can think of more exciting things to do than this.
3,1,"Well, let's imagine that we're the first ever to climb this mountain."
2,3,when we get to the top and the sea.
6,2,"Morning, Mum, and are your father and mother up?"
7,6,We like it.
5,7,Why do they always have to do something exciting?
3,5,What a gorgeous view.
5,3,"Hey, look, they're small coming from Mum and House."
3,5,Look.
1,3,Top hat.
5,1,I wonder who's how it is.
3,5,"I don't know, but I know Papa would like it."
1,3,It really gets inside.
3,1,"Papa's head got stuck in the hat, Mum."
1,3,Beautiful.
3,1,A little bit more.
4,3,"Silly, of course you can't."
3,4,Dreams are all right.
4,3,"Snuff, you're not still feeding your face, are you?"
5,4,"Only nightmares about having no food at all, little, my."
1,5,Can I try?
2,1,Mumen.
7,2,"Come on, Papa. Jump or you'll fall."
1,7,Damn.
7,1,"I won, I won."
1,7,And I'm going to climb right up here.
2,1,My cloud's starting to go.
1,2,She hit!
4,1,"Well, last time I saw him, he was hiding in the fireplace."
5,4,No. Have you looked in the cellar?
2,5,"Well, here I am, sniff."
3,2,I don't want to find you anyway!
5,3,You're too ugly to be the king of anything.
3,5,"Well, now, that's not a very nice thing to say to your friend."
1,3,Ah!
7,1,Where's my nose gone?
1,7,This is terrible!
2,1,Who are you?
1,2,Oh.
6,1,The Moomin's are about to call.
3,6,Moomin loves to spend as much time as he can as a friend as Snuffkin.
4,3,"You are the one that said it, you know."
3,4,"Oh, no."
5,3,Did you really throw it in the river?
3,5,I wish you hadn't.
5,3,But what about the eggshells it turned into clouds?
1,5,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
4,1,"What? What's happened? We were playing tag and she fell into an ant lion hole. We've got to get her out quickly. Come on, moving. Nearly there is North Maiden just a bit further. Help me, sniff. Give me your hand. Hurry! Look out! It's the ant lion! Look what you're doing to my hole. I'm sorry. I'll be out soon. Stop yelling and kicking like that. You're scaring off my prey."
8,4,"Are you all right, Snark Maiden? I can't reach her. I don't have to have ants for lunch, you know. Don't be a woman, please. You better get in there, sniff. What? Me? Don't worry. I'll hold on to you. You're the only one tall enough, sniff. Come on. You look nice and tasty. I'll eat you and step. Good, sniff. Look, I'm getting there. You're big."
7,8,"Come on, nearly a bit."
3,7,"Where have you been, self-kin? That's a big secret, movement. I won't tell anyone."
2,3,Pardon? Couldn't get back to sleep. Huh. What are you talking about?
4,2,I was awake last night too. And I know why you're so tired.
3,4,"You must have been dreaming. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in a hurry. Thanks, mama."
4,3,"Oh, nothing really important, movement, papa."
2,4,Snopkin!
3,2,The Hobgoblins. The Hobgoblins.
8,3,Are you talking about me?
3,8,"Yes, about how quickly you could dig yourself into a hole in the sand."
8,3,"I can dig myself in anywhere, anywhere at all."
3,8,"Yeah, just there, if you don't mind."
4,3,So you've caught the Aunt Lion. I've been watching.
2,4,"Hey, what is that?"
4,2,There's gallons of water.
3,4,What's happened to him?
2,3,Let's turn it over.
3,2,It's a hedgehog.
1,3,What?
3,1,What?
2,3,The red?
4,2,I wonder if it's possible to change it into spaghetti.
1,4,Huh?
2,1,Mama!
4,2,"Yeah, we did."
1,4,And fruit.
3,1,They must all be in the cellar and we can't get in this way.
2,3,"Yes, sir."
3,2,He's not bad for a Hobgoblin.
1,3,"Okay, let's do it."
4,1,"All right, Moomin, Mama."
3,4,"Come on, Snork Maiden, cheer up."
1,3,"Now, what's the matter, Snork Maiden?"
3,1,Papa?
2,3,"Nice, Snuffkin."
3,2,"Gosh, Snuffkin, I'd like to do that one day."
2,3,I thought they could use a bit of fun.
1,2,I'm not climbing up there.
5,1,"Well, we'll soon find out."
2,5,"Let's go in, then."
6,2,I don't like the look of it.
5,6,Don't be silly.
3,5,I think we must be right above the cave here.
4,3,"So tell me, how would you go in there and Mr. No at all?"
5,4,Stay where you are.
2,5,"Oh, really?"
4,2,No.
1,4,"Me, too."
5,1,You can't scare me like that.
4,5,So we needn't worry.
3,4,Will this do?
7,3,"Oh, oh!"
1,7,"Ah, ah, ah!"
6,1,The Himmelin?
3,6,"You haven't lost any more rare stabs, have you, Mr. Himmelin?"
6,3,"On the contrary, woman, I have them all."
3,6,"No one in the world has a better stab collection than you have, Mr. Himmelin."
6,3,I'd never ever snore.
4,6,You certainly do.
6,4,"Rubbish. Look, if you promise not to tell anyone, I'll take you to see something very special."
3,6,What is it?
1,3,It's not it.
7,1,You can pat a lost deer.
1,7,I don't think I'll ever invent anything again.
7,1,You know I might have been a bit overconfident.
2,7,Well designed.
4,2,"You could be right, Sniffkin."
2,4,"What shall we do then, Papa?"
3,2,So what are we going to do when we've repaired her?
1,3,Right.
2,1,"Sniff you lazy land lever, bring me some more Tari."
4,2,"Oh, all right, then. Sniff you lazy land lever, bring me some more Tari."
6,4,"No, my second cousin does that, and he's a complete idiot."
2,6,Mama! Mama!ed!
3,2,"All right, wait for me. I'm coming."
7,3,Oh!
6,7,I've decided what I'm going to collect.
9,6,"They love the laughter, and they love the living, the Moomin's."
6,9,Here they are for one and all.
1,6,Aren't you too ready yet?
2,1,It's Snork coming with us.
4,2,"Oh, it's too full."
1,4,Mr. Hamulin.
2,1,Have you found a rare plan for your collection yet?
6,2,"How exciting, charting new seas and exploring desert islands."
5,6,There's no room.
2,5,"Don't be silly, Sniff."
5,2,"It looks very full, almost thinking."
3,5,Oh.
4,3,I'll come next time.
5,4,I think that will be best.
3,5,It's hardly moving.
4,3,We're doing our best.
3,4,That's too small to be any good.
4,3,You're right.
3,4,We'll be careful.
2,3,"Watch me, you land lovers."
3,2,"Thank you, children."
4,3,I've seen someone.
1,4,I've never seen such rare and beautiful plants.
6,1,"Goodness, it's a perimeter."
1,6,"This is your perimeter, isn't it?"
7,1,"Oh, no, no, no."
3,7,They're not ghosts.
7,3,Don't get away.
2,7,I don't know.
7,2,We'll have to try and frighten them.
3,7,We don't want to go back to moving valley yet.
2,3,I wanted to get my hands on those happy fat nurse.
3,2,Always be prepared. That's my motto.
6,3,"Oh, yes."
2,6,It's not good.
3,2,No.
1,3,I know.
3,1,"I think it's over, Snork Maiden."
6,3,What a find I made today.
3,6,"Papa, I think that rope is getting loose."
6,3,Woman.
2,6,"Boy, that was close."
3,2,We needn't have worried.
7,3,Moomin!
1,7,What's that funny smell?
2,1,"Don't worry, we'll put some magic ointment on and it'll come back all lovely and curly."
3,2,I wonder where they're going.
4,3,"Snuffkin, you're really horrible. You knew I wanted to see them."
3,4,"Oh, that'll be fun. Let's look for the other side of the island."
2,3,"Mr. Himmelin, hurry up, sir. Or it will be dark before we get there."
1,2,"Hey, what's this?"
4,1,"Wow, watch that."
2,4,I can't find any as nice as yours.
3,2,I found it in a cave.
2,3,What's this?
3,2,It's a ship telescope.
4,3,I wish I could find something interesting.
1,4,What a big lady.
4,1,She's like a queen.
2,4,And Sank had seen?
4,2,I want to take it home.
2,4,Use her to frighten people away.
7,2,"Gosh, I hope it's not more haddy fattiners."
1,7,Do you like her eyes?
4,1,"One minute, I was looking for plants the next I'd fallen right into that hole."
3,4,"Well, woman, now that you're here, I could really do with your help."
2,3,"Oh, look!"
4,2,"Well, I'll look after it for you."
6,4,The movements.
7,6,"Oh, oh!"
2,7,Moments!
4,2,He's gonna fall in this time.
3,4,Are you all right?
2,3,"Uh, hold on, Mr. Postman."
7,2,Just do wait.
2,7,"Here's the letter, mama."
4,2,I bet she's coming back because she's missed all the fun.
2,4,But this is only the first time I've seen you do it.
3,2,"No, I expect the postman is still chasing her around the garden."
2,3,Mama!
7,2,That's Mum and Valley!
1,7,Would you like a hand with me?
7,1,Nothing.
1,7,All right.
4,1,Hello.
2,4,They said they haven't been bored once since we woke up
3,2,"What does well, well, me, Papa?"
7,3,"No, it's your turn to be great."
1,7,Excuse me.
7,1,Police?
1,7,"Oh, no."
7,1,I'm Mum and Mama.
1,7,Careful!
3,1,Here you are.
5,3,"Yes, please."
1,5,And I know she'll be here to hide.
3,1,"Well, it's very windy tonight, moment."
1,3,The girl.
5,1,Will she?
3,5,"Thank you, Moomin Papa."
1,3,"Well, it's midnight."
5,1,I'm going home.
1,5,Hmm.
5,1,You see?
3,5,And you're freezing my roses.
9,3,"They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements."
1,9,The movements.
2,1,"Mommy, papa! Help me!"
3,2,"Morning, mama."
2,3,She must have been real cold to freeze the roses.
3,2,"I dreamed that she was chasing me, papa."
5,3,Let's ask the police inspector to question them.
3,5,people can't wait to tell you those secrets.
1,3,"Hey, Snork Maiden."
4,1,But I thought you were living there.
3,4,I promise I won't.
1,3,There you are.
3,1,I'll think of you whenever I look at it.
1,3,"I feel very important and a little bit nervous, too."
3,1,"We don't need your help, little Mai."
4,3,"Ha, that's what you think."
3,4,It's not an interrogation.
2,3,So you can weedle out their secrets.
4,2,"Not really, but there's only one way to find out."
3,4,"Hello, it's Moomin."
7,3,"Well, if she has to, Moomin."
2,7,"Well, Snork Maiden."
3,2,I do hope so. I think they like it anyway.
2,3,Little Mai.
4,2,"What, interfere? Me? Never."
3,4,"Papa, if we get much closer."
2,3,You're the one who's upsetting her.
3,2,"It's yours, it's yours."
1,3,"No, yes."
3,1,And now we're good friends.
4,3,Rather muddled.
3,4,This is very difficult to understand.
4,3,I'll look after Snork.
1,4,She's coming!
4,1,"Oh, I hope Moomin Papa can do something."
3,4,"You better hide under the table, little my."
2,3,Don't be stupid!
3,2,"Yes, my hand was suddenly frozen."
2,3,Because I'll get you if you do.
4,2,"What snorkemaiden going to say, Mumen?"
3,4,"Well, I'm not going to tell snorkemaiden,"
4,3,"but I think Mum, I did the right thing."
2,4,This is it! This is it! I killed it!
1,2,The movements.
6,1,Here they are for one and all.
1,6,There were the movements.
7,1,"Yes, for a walk."
1,7,It seems that think of me and Bob are well and truly part of Moomin House now.
7,1,"Let's go get the suitcase, man."
2,7,"Moomin still has the shell that I gave him, but you said that he didn't."
4,2,Impossible.
1,4,And I found something you might be interested in.
4,1,"Well, what is it?"
2,4,It was still the same asigi as ever.
4,2,She's just a silly wooden doll.
2,4,I really couldn't.
1,2,"OK, it's clear."
2,1,"Hey, you two, you're not leaving, are you?"
3,2,"Oh, that's OK."
7,3,We can take it from here.
3,7,It's all right.
2,3,"How much you won't tell anyone, will you?"
4,2,"Moomin, I have a problem."
3,4,Go ahead.
4,3,"So you and the grove can't both have it, can you?"
3,4,You can't have.
4,3,Because it's a secret.
2,4,"No, you tell me first."
1,2,"No, the Kurds could still drag her in from here."
7,1,He looks very unhappy.
2,7,I can't believe it.
7,2,Mmm.
1,7,I can't believe it.
3,1,Oh no.
7,3,What's everybody looking for?
2,7,"Oh, you found it."
1,2,No! We don't mind anything else!
6,1,"Very well, here you are."
1,6,Excuse me?
2,1,"Oh, that's really me, no, please."
3,2,"Then we can have one each, what do you think?"
5,3,"Never mind her, she can see all right, get the gold coins."
3,5,"Oh, now next time, think before you make a wish."
7,3,Mr. Hub Goblin?
9,7,"They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements."
1,9,The Moomin's.
6,1,Here they are for one and all.
1,6,"Come on man, you were here already."
4,1,But what did you do to this old aunt?
3,4,I'm afraid not. Not since she became invisible.
6,3,"Oh, look, the door's opened."
1,6,Hmm. Hmm.
4,1,Papa! Papa!
2,4,I'm too late!
4,2,"Ha, they look silly."
3,4,"Anyway, you must look pretty bad if you want to make yourself invisible."
2,3,"Oh, yes I do. I'm bored, Moomin."
5,2,"That's boring, I never find any."
2,5,"Oh, it can't be that. She only took it a minute ago."
3,2,I think it's being away from that horrid ant.
1,3,Oh!
2,1,"Wow, what a lot of mushrooms!"
5,2,"Wow, that must be about four times as many as I've got."
4,5,Ninny's enjoyed herself.
6,4,I'd better yak you old ant never let her go mushroom picking.
4,6,"Oh, how awful for her."
3,4,"Ninny, I'll carry your basket. Let's go."
4,3,It stinks here.
6,4,"Without those feet, she'd be perfect for a bank robbery."
4,6,"Well, she's getting visible again, so she'll be no good to you at all, stinky."
1,4,"Oh, see, she's gone."
2,1,Don't you agree? Perfect.
4,2,"There weren't many left for us to get, because Ninny has picked them all."
2,4,Her feet have come back.
5,2,And you mustn't worry about stinky one little bit.
4,5,"If somebody upsets you, ignore him."
3,4,"Yeah, I like having presents every day."
4,3,"Well, she's okay, I suppose."
1,4,Oh! Ha! So she can talk!
2,1,"Danny, come on!"
1,2,"Right, let's go!"
2,1,"Well, good morning, everybody!"
5,2,Great!
2,5,"Ninny, are you all right?"
5,2,"Yes, thanks!"
4,5,"If I could see your face, I wouldn't have to ask!"
1,4,But that's what's so good about it!
3,1,"Okay, this is a good place to start,"
5,3,What? Never ever?
3,5,so you'll have plenty of time to find somewhere!
2,3,Two!
6,2,Two!
4,6,No!
3,4,She's always easy to find!
4,3,Ha!
7,4,Three!
2,7,"Don't wait, Ninny!"
1,2,Please!
4,1,Oh! That bush was too prickly anyway!
2,4,"Well, I've looked absolutely everywhere!"
5,2,"I bet, Sniff!"
4,5,Ninny!
6,4,You've got to find her!
1,6,Hurry up!
2,1,Help!
1,2,Here! Behind this rock!
2,1,Where's her voice coming from?
1,2,Try and shout a bit louder!
7,1,Over here!
1,7,The big rock!
3,1,Over there!
2,3,"Ninny, are you behind this rock, Ninny?"
3,2,"Oh, Papa!"
4,3,"Go on, yell! I want to see it!"
5,4,"Are you all right, Sniff?"
7,5,Hold it!
4,7,And scare her so much that she'd become totally invisible again!
2,4,"It's all right, Stinky! See you tomorrow!"
4,2,"Well, maybe she's never seen it before!"
1,4,It's the sea!
6,1,Mama! Mama! What's up?
1,6,"Well, there's an awful lot of water, that's for sure."
3,1,Anything would be nice.
2,3,"What, Papa?"
3,2,Did you really used to do things like that?
1,3,"Papa, you're dead!"
7,1,Dow?
1,7,"You could never, never."
7,1,That's the last thing to see you.
2,7,"And with a good strong set of healthy teeth, too."
1,2,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
8,1,"Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom"
1,8,"A snork? Wait! Wait! Please! Stop! Snork! Don't do it! Why have you brought everybody here, snork maiden?"
2,1,"As a matter of fact, you weren't. Oh, really? It looks very dangerous to me, snork."
3,2,"It's a long way. Oh look, isn't that snuffkin down there?"
1,3,Whoa!
2,1,"Come on, hurry."
1,2,Oh!
6,1,Is he dead?
2,6,"Excuse me, snork."
3,2,"You haven't said if I can have the wings or not yet, snork."
2,3,"Splendid, woman."
3,2,Perhaps we can get more help.
1,3,"Surely this must be deep enough, Papa?"
3,1,"Okay, Papa."
5,3,"Well, if there was something else, I'm not much of a reader."
1,5,Hey.
2,1,You did so much that these wings are hardly paymented enough.
1,2,"I'll practice, I promise."
2,1,"I'll find somewhere when I come out tomorrow, perhaps on that small hill near the cliff."
1,2,Hey!
3,1,On the table outside.
6,3,"You shouldn't have left them outside, Momen."
5,6,"Look, Momen."
7,5,"Oh no, turn around."
6,7,The wings will be badly damaged.
9,6,They love the laughter and they love the living.
6,9,Here they are for one and all.
1,6,"But oh, must she too perish in this terrible storm."
3,1,And he and his men have captured a rich and royal gallery.
1,3,"Great story, isn't it?"
3,1,"It was a good idea to let snort Maiden stay while he was away, wasn't it, Papa?"
2,3,"No, I'm afraid not, Inspector. We haven't heard anything."
3,2,"Well, in the book they were really great. I wish I'd been one."
2,3,"Oh, yes, I do. To sail across the seven seas, the holds of your ship's crowned with treasures."
1,2,"Oh, what's the matter?"
2,1,"Ha, that's great news."
4,2,He should make it into a pirate flying ship.
2,4,Nobody at all!
4,2,Moomin probably wanted to go looking for an adventure.
2,4,What is it?
1,2,"Oh, yes. Snork. Of course."
2,1,Put her down.
8,2,"Blast me, baby. So, come here, you little pineapple."
2,8,Then you only have yourself to blame.
8,2,"Hey, what? Blame? Stay where you are now. I will not be bitten again."
4,8,Keep away a little cat.
8,4,"Well, don't hurt her then."
2,8,"Well, then you better take me instead, because I'm much easier to carry."
8,2,"Oh, yes, lots of people. When you overstab win, baby."
2,8,I'll only go if you promise that you won't hurt Snork Maiden.
8,2,"If I find that you've heard her in any way at all, my revenge will be terrible."
1,8,"All right, all right, all right."
8,1,"Let Snork Maiden go. Do you hear me, Captain?"
2,8,"What should we do, Inspector?"
8,2,"Hey, are you still there, you ruffian?"
2,8,"what will snorks say, oh dear, dear."
8,2,now you've proved it.
2,8,The inspector's losing control.
8,2,What the clank would I?
1,8,Calm down. Take the museum.
2,1,"Cheer up, Snark Maiden!"
8,2,"Mastik's stuff, still."
3,8,"I'll take it, Inspector."
8,3,"Splice me, babe. Raise what's taken him so long."
3,8,"I've brought you something to drink, Captain."
8,3,"All right. Come on, then. And no funny stuff."
3,8,Don't worry. I'm on my own.
8,3,"Have you done a drink for me, too?"
2,8,"Yes, Captain."
8,2,All right. Stay there and put down the tree.
2,8,"The bigger one is for you, Captain."
8,2,Now move away.
2,8,"But, Captain, there's not enough for you in the small one."
8,2,Strawberry juice isn't exactly my favorite tip of you.
2,8,You drink it.
8,2,"What's the matter, Milad? You said the drink wasn't poisoned, didn't you?"
1,8,"No, Movement, don't. There's something in it. You'll be poisoned."
3,1,"It's all right, Snark Maiden. It's nothing dangerous. Don't worry about me."
1,3,That's it. Drink up again.
8,1,"Down the hatch, Milad."
3,8,Yeah.
8,3,You're not my pretty one.
9,8,"They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements."
6,9,Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come.
3,6,"Mama, can I borrow this? Of course, dear."
6,3,"Oh, dear. Oh, there are puddles everywhere. Oh, dear."
1,6,That's wonderful.
2,1,"Oh, I'm sorry, you must be starving."
1,2,"Moving, lunch is ready."
2,1,He's collecting worms for fishing.
1,2,It's my very best one.
2,1,And I'm sure you know who I mean by certain people.
1,2,"Did you catch anything with the sieve, Moment?"
2,1,"Yes, he did. Something that's now hidden in his room."
1,2,"beetles and spiders, mosquitoes, scorpions, or poisonous centipedes, horrible things."
2,1,"And there'll be so many of them, thousands and thousands, and they'll take over Moon Valley and eat us all."
1,2,"The rain could have brought them down from space, Mama, couldn't it?"
6,1,And it wasn't like ordinary rain.
2,6,Have you finished already?
1,2,"Yes, I have. Tell them they mustn't go into my room. Or they'll have to take the consequence."
2,1,"Oh, but he's going to tell snuffkin this secret."
9,2,"Yep. The cards told me that if I caught five minutes, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south."
1,9,"Well, anyway, who would I talk to or tell my secrets to?"
2,1,"It could be so small that it would go in a glass jar, snuffkin."
1,2,Mama promised me that she wouldn't let anyone in.
2,1,My dragon can fly. He's flying. He's flying.
1,2,"He seems to have a thing about ears, doesn't he?"
2,1,Good news. I think he's trying to heat up snuffkins coffee. He must really like him.
4,2,"Well, I hope he's careful with that hot breath. We don't want to start a fire."
2,4,"I'm sure that'll keep him quiet. That better go. Thanks for the coffee, Mumma."
1,2,"Oh no, it'll suffocate him."
2,1,Don't do that.
1,2,What? Just leave it?
9,1,"Oh, they're not too bad if you roast them."
4,9,Hi.
2,4,"Oh, really?"
9,2,They make the world's worst pets.
2,9,They never want to settle in one place.
4,2,I think it gave her a taste of her own medicine.
2,4,The movement was very happy that snuffkin was staying in movement valley
1,2,"And as for the dragon, well, who wants to be loved by a silly old dragon?"
2,1,The movements are having fun day after day.
1,2,The movements.
2,1,They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.
1,2,Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
9,1,Come on and sit down here with me.
1,9,I'll take you up to a movement land.
2,1,Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

2,9,"I'm afraid not, and I think I must have examined every single plant in Moomin Valley."
1,2,It looks like you found us some new friends to play with.
9,1,Huh?
1,9,"Oh, later on. I think you'll very whole-finally."
6,1,"Oh, thank you all very much indeed."
1,6,"It looks very untidy, doesn't it, mother?"
2,1,Then we've got it all to ourselves.
1,2,You might hurt yourself.
2,1,"Oh, come on, stop it at once."
1,2,But you'll hear mother.
2,1,Is it nothing much broken?
1,2,I didn't think I'd be too heavy for it.
2,1,I know.
1,2,"I'll just try it out, now and again."
2,1,What if somebody asks us to play?
1,2,"What do you mean, play?"
2,1,"I hope you're not thinking of the Moomin, are you?"
1,2,"Where are you going, mother?"
2,1,It was a terrible mistake coming to Moomin Valley.
1,2,Good afternoon.
2,1,"Oh, you're Tarzan."
1,2,"Oh, no, not the hungry crocodile at the bottom of the porch."
2,1,He's not told her.
1,2,I bet their mother told them not to talk to us.
2,1,There's absolutely right.
1,2,A bit frightening.
9,1,"You just have to put your legs up, that's all."
1,9,Even if I do say so myself.
6,1,"So, why don't you show us, stinky?"
2,6,"If you go first, I'll be second."
1,2,"Hello, I want to see how it's done."
2,1,"Then throw me the rope, and I'll follow."
1,2,"Now, tell the truth."
2,1,"You've never done it. Have you, stinky?"
1,2,"Of course I've done it, stupid."
2,1,"Now, come on. Come on."
1,2,"Come on, stinky."
2,1,but they didn't get home until very late in the evening.
1,2,"Bye, we'll see you tomorrow."
2,1,With movement of the others.
1,2,"They kidnapped you, did they?"
6,1,Let me see six pebbles.
1,6,We start hemulating. Has Snork Maiden just gone past you?
6,1,"Snork Maiden. No, all I've seen going past is a very large snowball."
1,6,That was Snork Maiden.
6,1,But she's not made of snow.
1,6,"Oh, I'll praise the boob all she's still breathing. She's just knocked herself out."
6,1,"Oh, Mom, what's happened to her?"
1,6,I want to get her home to Mama.
6,1,"Wake up, Snork Maiden."
1,6,"Has she come around yet, Mr. Himulet?"
6,1,"How are you feeling, Snork Maiden?"
1,6,"Are you all right, Snork Maiden?"
2,1,We're still up in Lonely Mountains.
1,2,What? A Princess?
6,1,I think the poor girl must have lost her memory.
1,6,Of course not. She's just pretending.
2,1,Don't be little like a court jester.
1,2,"Oh, very funny."
2,1,I think he wanted stinky as a contrast.
1,2,you'll need to solve three riddles.
2,1,"I am honored to be here, your royal highness."
1,2,He'll do.
2,1,Two?
1,2,"For a faux-galat night, that is correct."
2,1,Love.
1,2,That's amazing.
2,1,21.
1,2,Oh.
2,1,"It's your turn now, stinky."
1,2,Think she'll ever get her memory back?
2,1,Of course she will.
1,2,This is not our idea of a suitor.
2,1,"I don't know, but she probably wants to be remembered"
1,2,"Oh, she's coming down."
2,1,I'll get it on.
1,2,That's weird.
3,1,"So, it looks as though the rumor was right."
2,3,I wonder if there are any aliens in it.
1,2,There's a funny noise coming from it.
2,1,Do you think it will?
1,2,Oh!
2,1,"I'm not sure, Mama, but let's get away in case it does explode."
1,2,I'll take the radio with me.
2,1,"Papa, where have you gone?"
1,2,Snorke made it. What an earth's the matter.
3,1,"Where are you going, Mum and Papa?"
1,3,It looks like an alien child to me.
9,1,"I'm sorry we can't understand you, but I'm sure you'll like milk, even if you don't"
1,9,I think he's missing his home.
2,1,I know what to do.
6,2,"Now him, this one, right?"
3,6,Oh dear.
1,3,To see that nice shiny man.
2,1,No! Don't go there!
3,2,"Hello! Hello, Inspector."
2,3,The inspector's coming back.
1,2,What about the alien?
3,1,"Open up in the name of the law, Moomin Papa."
9,3,Papa.
1,9,"We'll get him, Papa."
2,1,"It's at the bottom of the river, Papa."
4,2,Just a couple more.
1,4,"Fatal battle is my dear mother, would say."
2,1,I wonder when it'll come.
1,2,"Oh, what is it?"
2,1,"No, please, I beg you."
1,2,"Me, too."
2,1,"I'm sure that Moomin, Mama and Moomin, Papa"
1,2,Little May and Snuff are both trying to cook.
6,1,Mama.
4,6,"Helio, me."
2,4,"Oh, look! Look! It's Papa!"
1,2,"Oh, yes. You can try mine."
2,1,I don't think that will happen.
1,2,Dad can't ever remember it so hot.
2,1,Even the river has dried up.
1,2,Here you are.
2,1,"You always do, don't you, little my?"
1,2,"Oh, because I can't see the stars from there and it makes me feel romantic looking at them."
2,1,"By my tail, a jungle!"
1,2,"Well, we found a crate of tropical seeds and planted them last night."
2,1,It's fantastic.
1,2,I know. We can go on a safari.
2,1,It looks like an orchid to me.
1,2,"This is a real tropical jungle, isn't it, Snuffkin?"
2,1,Not quite.
1,2,"Oh, my goodness."
6,1,"Did you open the door, Mr. Hamilon?"
2,6,"Mr. Hamilon, you know all about plants."
1,2,Music.
2,1,"Oh dear. Oh! Snuffkin, don't stop playing your harmonica whatever you do or did they'll only get angry and attack us all over again. If I don't stop soon, I might never want to play again."
6,2,"Well, perhaps the music has made them more friendly. Be careful, Mr. Himmelon. Oh, don't worry."
1,6,"Papa, we must make sure the trap door won't open again."
2,1,Ah!
1,2,You're just like Tarzan.
2,1,Ah!
1,2,without wild animals.
6,1,Now what have we here?
1,6,"Go away, I'm not a zoologist."
2,1,"Well, that's a surprise."
1,2,I just don't trust him.
2,1,"Well, of course, Moomin."
3,2,What's the matter?
2,3,"We come, everyone. The tigers are leaving."
1,2,"Be careful, movement."
2,1,"Don't worry, little mind. Papa will think of something you'll see."
6,2,"Oh, dear, I think so."
1,6,"Oh, really? Well, they're not wild animals at all."
9,1,Gotcha!
1,9,"Look, there's the seed."
2,1,"Ours, we're from the zoo."
1,2,"The zoo? Oh, you've got one of the crocodiles."
2,1,"Yes, and a lot of trouble he gave us as well."
1,2,There's another one around here somewhere. We saw them.
2,1,"Yes, we know there is, but we haven't been able to find him yet."
1,2,Hippos? Hippos?
2,1,Which zoo are you from? I bet they'd pay well to get you back.
1,2,"Now, look here. I'm a Mormon, not a hippo."
2,1,"I'm sure they've escaped from the zoo somewhere, though."
1,2,"We haven't escaped from anywhere, certainly not a zoo."
2,1,"Quickly, man, lower the live boat."
1,2,I'm sure. Now where's this ship?
6,1,"It's alright, mama. We're here."
1,6,She did chase us at first.
2,1,"Oh, get all the animals into the house first, you."
1,2,The zoo men have come to get you.
2,1,Papa!
3,2,"Now then, what's going on?"
2,3,"Get around, men."
3,2,Ready and look.
2,3,Great.
1,2,And I make that 10 minutes up to you.
3,1,I missed the zoo.
1,3,"Yes, this cold is awful."
10,1,Come on now.
2,10,But we're nothing like hippos.
10,2,"We know you're not pure breads, but the public will never be able to tell."
1,10,"Well, perhaps the inspector will come looking for us."
2,1,he'll bring the full power of the Lord to bear on them.
1,2,Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
4,1,Look what I've got. It's a runner player
2,4,"Moment, Papa will get it working for you"
1,2,"Right have you got the idea now? Yes, I think so"
4,1,"Well, then can you dance sniff I've never tried right. Well tried now"
2,4,"I can smell winter in the air, Moomin, Papa."
6,2,"Snuffkin, come and dance with me."
2,6,"Hmm, Snuffkin, do you know anything about record players?"
1,2,"Oh, Moomin, you promise you'll be back on the first day of spring."
2,1,"So yes, all right, Moomin."
1,2,It's Moomin home.
2,1,Let's go.
1,2,What can we do?
2,1,"Can you take the ship down, movement?"
1,2,"Oh, why do you want to get off?"
2,1,I want to be on my own.
1,2,"Oh, please stay here."
2,1,"No, really, movement, please."
6,2,"Off for the winter, Asian Afghan."
2,6,Yes.
1,2,"Papa, Papa, Mama, Mama, Mama, what's wrong with me?"
2,1,Why not wait till tomorrow?
1,2,This is Papa's bathhouse. He built it himself and he'd be very glad to know you're using it.
2,1,"Little Mike, we're over here, huh?"
1,2,I guess the water must be low and there's a gap left there.
2,1,Little boy.
1,2,"Ow, that's hot moment."
2,1,"Praise the ball, Bob."
1,2,"Ah, this is great. I'm really starving. I hope there's lots."
6,1,"Hey, what? You're joking."
1,6,"Oh, so you spend all year going where the snow is?"
6,1,Not at all. Life should be a struggle.
2,6,"What? You don't mean you swim in this weather, do you?"
6,2,The water must be very close to freezing.
1,6,"There's some more in the cellar, but we've got cranberry up here if you'd like that."
6,1,"No, thanks. This will do for now."
1,6,Is everybody like you? Where you come from?
6,1,"Oh, I agree."
1,6,"Yes, I suppose I am."
6,1,Put it out of your mind.
1,6,Why do you think your brothers are wolves? Did someone tell you they were?
6,1,"Why don't you travel around with me, sorry, you?"
1,6,An igloo? You mean a house made of snow?
6,1,"Yes, that's exactly."
1,6,Mr. Brisk really loves this jam. He can't stop eating it.
6,1,That's the whole point. You don't have to. You just move your skis. He's his winking.
1,6,"Well, then if I learn to ski first, then I won't fall."
2,1,"Little mind has skis, too."
1,2,I don't think I like this. It's too steep. Can I practice on something a bit flatter?
6,1,"Well, maybe next time. Now then, I'll have a few rolls."
1,6,"You know, I think this hill is even steeper than the last one."
6,1,"Oh, stop it, please."
1,6,"What are you looking at, sorry, you?"
6,1,"Oh, hello, Mr. Bresch."
1,6,"Look, I'm sorry, but all the jam's gone."
6,1,"Oh, well, never mind. It was a great jam."
1,6,"I'm afraid I'm not very brave or strong, but if you'd let me stay with you."
6,1,"Oh, hello, little buggy. What are you doing here?"
2,6,That was spring breaking through the ice.
1,2,"I'm always right, aren't I?"
2,1,Snuffkin!
1,2,I had one of them away.
2,1,"What a good idea, Mumen."
1,2,"Well, it was so much fun the last time, wasn't it?"
6,1,I feel perfectly all right.
1,6,"Now, stinky, tell me which way does Snuffkin normally travel south?"
6,1,"Where are you taking him, Stinky? You can see he's not well."
1,6,"Is that really right, Moomin?"
6,1,You stay nice and warm in bed and I'll mix some of grandma's potion with honey for you.
2,6,Oh?
6,2,"Yes, you're Snuffkin."
2,6,Isn't that water still a little cold for that?
6,2,"Just think, I'll be the one that's set by Snuffkin's fire."
2,6,"Hmm, that's no big thing, little fella. It's a pretty chilly night out here."
1,2,"Oh, well, I haven't got one."
2,1,"Oh, come on. You do go on a bit, old fella. You just get warm now."
1,2,"Do you think, Snuffkin? Oh, I don't know whether I should ask you or I don't want to offend you."
2,1,"Well, choosing a name is important. I'd have to think carefully about that."
1,2,But it will be easy for you. You know everything.
2,1,Now listen to me. You can't look up to people too much if you want to be yourself. It's not right.
1,2,"But Snuffkin, you're so clever. You can do anything, anything at all. I know you can."
2,1,Now isn't that wonderful? What?
1,2,I'd love to have someone that missed me so much they were miserable until I came back.
2,1,"Well, perhaps I'm not going there. I might have somewhere else to visit instead."
1,2,"Oh, Moon will be very sad if you don't go back."
2,1,"Yes, but you've got to have time to be on your own as well."
1,2,Of course you have and I've taken up too much of yours now.
2,1,"Good night, little fella."
6,2,You remembered.
2,6,"Well, what do you think of TD Wu, my friend?"
1,2,TD Wu.
6,1,That's right. It's a wonderful name.
2,6,"Ah, good idea, TD Wu. About what I said before."
6,2,"Oh, I didn't take that seriously. You just got upset at something I said."
2,6,Maybe you do.
1,2,Moment will be happy. Say hello to everyone from TD Wu.
2,1,I will. And I'll tell them how it came about.
1,2,"That's where you keep your harmonica, isn't it, Snuffkin? It's really famous, you know?"
2,1,I didn't realize that.
1,2,Do you know? I've never ever heard any music.
2,1,Really? What would you like me to play?
1,2,"Anything. Oh, I know. What about Moon's favorite?"
2,1,Hmm? That's Snuffkin!
1,2,Does Moonman Papa want all of you to go away to this lighthouse?
2,1,"Yes, that will be good."
1,2,"Well, I guess that might have something to do with it."
2,1,"Well, it sounds a bit odd to me, Moonman."
1,2,"No, it's not."
2,1,We're going to live in a real lighthouse and save ships from the rocks and being wrecked terrible storms.
1,2,"Oh, he won't mind at all."
2,1,"Ah, but if you thought, Moonman, that might be exactly why he chooses to do it."
1,2,You mean that he might want to be on his own all the time?
2,1,"Well, some people like it like that."
1,2,Sometimes I like being on my own.
2,1,"Not for long, though."
1,2,It'll be a lot of fun.
2,1,"What, to a lonely lighthouse?"
1,2,Yes.
2,1,"How long would it take us to get their Moonman, Papa?"
1,2,But it looks so tiny.
2,1,"Well, it's a real fine day for sailing."
7,2,"Look, Snuff is still waving."
1,7,"It's no good shouting little Mai, he can't hear you."
3,1,"Of course we will be, Papa, if we carry on like this, perhaps we'll see the light from the lighthouse while it's still dark."
1,3,"Ah, this is the light."
3,1,"Papa, the wind's dropped."
1,3,"Stupid wind, I really wanted to see the lighthouse at night."
4,1,I thought I heard something.
1,4,What happened in the first place to make it become a ghost ship? That's what I wanna know.
4,1,"If it had been a real ship, we'd probably be sinking now."
1,4,We're doing very well.
4,1,What did I tell you?
1,4,"Dear, don't shout."
4,1,"Bunny, pair."
7,4,"Tell me, Moonman, but leave out the bits I wouldn't like."
3,7,"They're a bit strange, aren't they?"
1,3,They must live somewhere here on the island.
3,1,"Well, at least we can see the floor now."
1,3,"Nobody's cleaned here for a long time, that's for sure."
3,1,"Oh, that's awful."
4,3,"Unspeakable horror, please be quiet, little my."
1,4,"Oh, I hope not Papa."
4,1,He might have run out of rum and gone to get more.
7,4,"He just got more and more lonely and fed up, and then went off and got a girlfriend."
1,7,"Be careful, snuffkin."
3,1,"Look over there. There's something moving, but I can't see what it is."
1,3,What's up?
4,1,Don't be stupid.
1,4,"Oh, I have a look snuffkin. There must be something there. Please snuffkin, please."
4,1,Let me at them! Where are they? I'll teach them to spoil my dream!
3,4,"Are you going to scare it away, Papa?"
7,3,Mm-hmm.
4,7,Who are you?
1,4,I'll write it out for you. What's his name?
3,1,"Come on, let's go."
1,3,"Hello, my name is Moomin, and this is my friend Snuffkin."
3,1,Yeah.
4,3,Let me present our very own hand-built ghost ship.
1,4,"Yeah, sorry. I'm afraid that was me."
3,1,"Yes, all right."
1,3,"Oh, well, at least he looks like a ghost."
4,1,Ghosts look pretty silly when the sun's shining if you ask me.
3,4,Mama.
1,3,"What is it, Mum and Dia?"
3,1,Papa's gone fishing again.
1,3,He's not working on the lamp at all.
3,1,"What are you making, little boy?"
1,3,Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you!
5,1,"Like what, for instance, I think we've done everything one could possibly do"
1,5,"Well, can you think of anything except catching grasshoppers?"
7,1,"Oh no, it's from a woman Papa this time"
5,7,"It's your father's old girlfriend, of course"
7,5,Never
4,7,"Oh, how boring"
1,4,"Oh, don't worry, there's plenty of time for arranging a welcome party"
7,1,"Oh, why can't you tell if you're not an expert?"
5,7,"Oh, I wouldn't mind shouldering her burden"
7,5,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
5,7,"What I really need is a microscope and a laboratory. Hmm, and they're expensive, I guess. Yes, they are, and I don't have any money."
1,5,"Should be, it's full of golden coins."
3,1,I'd like you to meet us up in a minute.
1,3,She's very small for a daughter.
5,1,"Ridiculous, he knows nothing about money."
1,5,Really?
5,1,"Oh, sniff is a great friend of mine."
1,5,But hardly a member of the family.
7,1,"Hello, moment. And you must be on Jane."
1,7,"You maybe, but not to me."
5,1,"I'm a friend of Moomin, Aunt Jane."
1,5,"Oh, I do hope you'll be comfortable here."
5,1,Quite near here?
3,5,Yes!
1,3,"Oh, there's nobody here."
4,1,I know where Moomin Papa is right now.
1,4,"So you want some of my gold, who do you young lady?"
4,1,I couldn't care less about your silly gold.
7,4,"If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too."
1,7,"Oh, so?"
7,1,It's perfectly good money and all in gold coins.
3,7,"Ah, ah, ah, ah."
7,3,and pretty paintings on the wall.
1,7,A party?
4,1,Not again.
7,4,Dear.
4,7,I'm so happy for you.
7,4,Darn.
4,7,I should have let us up better than flowers.
3,4,"Well, not very far. I'll be back right after mid-summer."
7,3,What's all that smoke? Is it the volcano and your father's memoirs?
4,7,Snork maiden?
7,4,"Yeah, the earthquake started."
3,7,I don't believe this.
1,3,What's happened to the kitchen and dining room?
7,1,Just because I fear.
5,7,"Boy, I'm sleepy."
7,5,What's this? Where am I? What's happened here?
1,7,"Moomin Papa, you've got to do something. Do something right away."
4,1,"If you hadn't, maybe we wouldn't be about to sink altogether."
5,4,Something will float by. Big enough to take all of us. We just have to wait.
4,5,Why didn't you say so before?
7,4,Why do you say that? What do you mean exciting? Do you mean interesting or do you mean scary little my?
4,7,"I don't like that. Look, every mirror has a chair in front of it."
7,4,This house was full of ladies and he chatted her a little mirror.
3,7,You're so right.
7,3,One look at you and he won't even notice anything else.
5,7,"You know, it's very bad for me to go hungry. I always feel unwell if I don't eat."
1,5,"Oh, but where on earth did you find them, sniff?"
5,1,In a football.
1,5,Did I hear someone call me an ugly thing just now?
3,1,Kings are murderers.
1,3,"Oh, and you are one of these actors?"
3,1,An actress.
1,3,This is no ordinary house.
3,1,And it is a great honor for you to be here at all.
1,3,Does this mean that we can stay here just for a while?
3,1,"Yes, until the actors return."
5,3,"You better stay here, you're bound to fall into the water."
4,5,Look who's talking!
1,4,"Do what you want, as long as you don't damage the theater to get here?"
3,1,"Don't whistle, you idiot!"
1,3,He was standing guard over a flying ship after all.
3,1,"No, they're trying to destroy the pamphor's box."
7,3,It's so lovely to be out in the fresh air with moon and a tree in blue.
3,7,I don't believe it.
1,3,That's just typical.
7,1,And how can we have drifted so far away?
4,7,"Oh, no!"
1,4,"Oh, little Mai!"
3,1,There shouldn't swim about like that.
1,3,"I told you so, the branch didn't break, did it?"
4,1,"It doesn't matter, I rather like this boat."
7,4,"It's getting dark, isn't it?"
1,7,"Of course, I've forgotten tonight's mid-summer eve!"
4,1,"Yeah, seems I was probably the luckiest one as usual."
7,4,A house!
3,7,Shall we go there?
7,3,At last!
3,7,My only relative.
4,3,Good health!
7,4,"Oh, please have some more. Oh, this is so nice."
4,7,"Oh, don't cry."
3,4,"Look over there, little lion."
4,3,"Whoa, I have."
7,4,Now we must pick nine flowers.
1,7,"Hey, Snorke maiden."
7,1,"But I tell you, we've done nothing wrong, nothing at all."
1,7,That's not true.
7,1,I can act very well.
5,7,I want the part that finds the treasure.
1,5,"No, that's impossible. We have no play."
7,1,"No trouble at all, my dear. Any number of acts."
1,7,They were even falling over the lake.
7,1,"Hmm, hmm. Let's see."
1,7,"I've got to see that one again. But who will guard my prisoners, I wonder?"
7,1,"Good idea. We love the theatre, so we won't try to run away, officer. I promise."
1,7,"Well, in that case, you won't be able to see the play."
7,1,"Well, then you can't go either, officer."
5,7,"Ah, please, woman, papa. I don't want to be just a lion's ugly behind."
1,5,His script should be ready now. We have to start practicing for the opening night tomorrow morning.
5,1,There are some things I don't like about this script.
1,5,"We certainly wouldn't bite anyone, obviously."
7,1,"But it feels nice and warm, and I love the color."
1,7,"We're real sorry too, but you don't need to worry because actually we're not going back to jail."
7,1,We've got other plans. We're going to the theater. Just see my parents play.
1,7,"Mom and Papa, Mom and Papa."
3,1,I've just read your script and I think you have a big problem.
1,3,Maybe one of us could stand behind something and sort of read their lines.
4,1,"Listen kids, you can be as noisy as you like out here but once we're at the dinner you have to be quiet."
7,4,We still have very far to go.
3,7,I'll put you out.
1,3,"Snorkemaiden, I'm so glad to see you."
7,1,Exactly what this theater needs.
1,7,"Moomin Papa, do you think we should thank the audience"
3,1,What a wonderful feeling to be flying like this.
2,3,We're much too high.
3,2,"This is okay, really."
7,3,"Well, I didn't."
1,7,"Is there some problem, snork?"
7,1,"Or it will just be an ordinary ship, not a flying ship."
1,7,"But you wouldn't care about that, would you? Who cares what other people think?"
7,1,"But I'm sure people will be very nice about it, even if it doesn't get off the ground."
3,7,You want me to be a pilot?
2,3,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"
1,2,"Stinky, I'm going to steer that ship, is that perfectly clear? You're not to touch the wheel, I'm the pilot now. What on earth was that about? Wouldn't you find it difficult to steer it? Oh, no, it's real easy, but of course, I'd need to practice before the public demonstration. Is the snorke going to fly his own ship? He'll be there, but he has to stay down in the"
3,1,"Not natural for movements to fly about up in the air. Is it snuffkin? Quite right. What would you and the snorke do if things went wrong? We will be wearing parachutes, you know? Parachutes. You do know what they are, don't you, Papa? Of course I do. They come down from the sky like this, like this. Exactly, but of course, we won't need a parachute, because nothing will go wrong. And I will be the first flying ship pilot ever!"
1,3,"Oh. Hi there. Hello, my young man. Hello. How do you do? How do you do everybody? Hello, sir. I wonder if you can help me. Do you happen to know where the snorke's factory is? You mean the ship? I must see him. I'm most eager to have a look at his famous flying ship. How do you know about that? It's supposed to be very secret. The information must have leaked out somehow."
3,1,The adhesive tape that sticks only to itself. This is perhaps the greatest of all my latest inventions. Whatever is that? This is proper self a man powered fan. Infanible in Moomin weather. All these are my latest inventions.
1,3,"Well, we'll find out pretty soon. Maybe you don't realize it, but the snorke is pretty clever, you know."
4,1,"Well, how come you saw him? There's a crack that's just about wide enough for me, but I won't tell you where."
2,4,"Oh, stinky, stinky. We're flying at a height of just over 2,000 meters now."
1,2,"Well, it was sort of round like this."
7,1,"Oh, there he goes again."
1,7,"So you never saw it yourself, Mr. Hamlin?"
3,1,It has to be in the afternoon sunshine after heavy rain.
1,3,Going over lonely mountains and back would take at least two days.
3,1,"Oh, will you show me the way?"
1,3,Why not?
3,1,I think he wants to come along too.
5,3,You're very early.
1,5,"Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?"
5,1,"But we aren't taking the shortcut, are we?"
1,5,How far is the forest of witches?
5,1,"And can you also tell us how long from one end of the forest to the other, Snuffkin?"
1,5,I wanted to go with them.
5,1,"Oh, this is a spooky forest."
3,5,Here.
5,3,"On your tree, then, I guess."
3,5,It's falling to wreck and ruin.
4,3,"Look around for dried spices, magic herbs, brums, sticks, and a black cat."
3,4,Let's get out of here.
2,3,Where are you off to anyway?
3,2,This is it isn't it yes it is where's the golden fish I really don't know I've never seen it either
1,3,oh it's deep down in here somewhere I can't see any fish anywhere
5,1,maybe it was a very funny joke the hamula doesn't show let's sit down and wait I'm sure the golden fish will appear for us I don't believe it do me
1,5,the hamula was certainly right hardly anyone has seen this golden fish and we're not gonna see it either
3,1,maybe somebody ate him years ago stinky be quiet please did you see it where did you see it
7,3,huh I saw a fish jump but I couldn't tell if it was golden it was much too far away with the sun over
5,7,your raft over there hey let's take it and go on to the middle of the lake but it's much too small for all of us
7,5,and then we'll both be very wealthy I think it was somewhere around here wasn't it or unless I
1,7,just have to sit and wait here we've no choice I'm not going home until I've seen it I'm happy to wait
5,1,all day you won't find it by looking up at the sky you know what fish like it in places where there
1,5,I hate fishing guess we better think about getting back otherwise we'll never get home before nightfall
7,1,I don't want to get lost on a raft in the dark on this lonely lake perhaps we were expecting too much
1,7,maybe your right snort maiden but I really thought we'd see it this is the most disappointing day of my
3,1,it's not going to stop
5,3,Pardon what?
3,5,What's the matter Papa?
1,3,You find anything?
7,1,I'll look somewhere else.
1,7,You've chosen the wrong words.
7,1,"But, but I have the book and you're not him."
3,7,You're not him.
1,3,"Ah, then you must have the power to make any wish come true."
3,1,What are we going to do about this spirit?
7,3,"Sorry, me."
3,7,why don't you let me give you my wish right now?
7,3,"Listen, moment."
1,7,weren't perfectly polished.
7,1,"Deepers, who's your rich friend?"
1,7,"My pearl necklace, extraordinarily beautiful pearls, 87 of them."
7,1,You stole it.
3,7,Doctor!
7,3,"Of course, Inspector. It was a present. I swear it."
3,7,That's a secret between me and Moomin.
7,3,A secret?
3,7,"I've never known them to lie before, Mrs. Philly John."
1,3,Just so.
4,1,You have to stop when I say so.
3,4,"Please stop me, I'm going to give it back to me."
7,3,I don't know who lives there.
3,7,But why on earth do you want the hobgoblin?
1,3,That bonfire looks inviting.
3,1,"Yes, winders on the way."
1,3,"If snuffkin says I could go with him,"
3,1,Could I ask you something?
1,3,But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly.
3,1,You're right.
5,3,"What do you mean, funny?"
1,5,"Okay, I'll come have a look."
3,1,Be careful.
5,3,This is what a kite looks like.
1,5,"Well, why don't we repair it?"
7,1,Is it okay?
1,7,That's it!
5,1,What is it?
7,5,What did you say?
3,7,Listen carefully.
7,3,"When we fly the kite next time,"
5,7,It won't! Snorke is fixed it.
1,5,"Now then, do you want to do it, Moomin?"
7,1,This is getting bumpy. What's that? Let's see if there's something very strange happening on that kite.
1,7,You found her?
3,1,"Moomin, to go into hibernation and snuck into me for his trip south."
1,3,"But we were just off for a walk. I know. Well then, why are you going?"
3,1,"Moomin, do you mind if we come along with you? Of course not."
5,3,"You see, we thought you were probably plotting something secret and weren't letting any of us in on it."
1,5,"Oh, come on, we don't have any secrets from you. It's just that, well, you know what I mean."
7,1,"Well, I'm coming back here in winter to see it for myself."
1,7,"I'm not all that mad about the snow and the cold and dark, so I'll hibernate."
5,1,Sitting down.
7,5,For what? For grandma.
1,7,"But there are other rocks by the path, you know?"
7,1,Or there?
5,7,"Yes, I suppose so. It's not very far from here."
3,5,"Yes, she was an hour early."
7,3,"Where do you find all these children, my dear?"
3,7,I hear all alone and then they came along the path and waited to help.
7,3,"Well, don't just stand there, my dear. Let's go."
3,7,Come along.
1,3,So they don't exist?
7,1,Yes.
1,7,"This is nice for Moomin, too. Now he'll have Snorke Maiden to keep him company."
7,1,Bye.
1,7,"If she really is a witch, then what about the girl?"
3,1,"Yes, Snuffkin. We must."
1,3,Maybe the witch needed an innocent maiden to try out some potions to experiment on her.
4,1,Is that okay?
7,4,"It's very quiet, do you think there's anybody home?"
5,7,They disappeared.
7,5,"Don't worry, I've got a pretty good idea where they were heading for."
5,7,A real one?
7,5,Why don't we go there too?
3,7,Right.
7,3,How kind of you.
3,7,"Oh, this is too much."
7,3,"I'm sure that's just what you think, young man."
1,7,I'll do it for you.
3,1,I don't think that snake ever got bitten before.
7,3,I'll get another.
3,7,I'm very curious.
7,3,"Why are you free here, huh?"
1,7,"No, no, we're very sorry."
7,1,You said you'd visit these people?
3,7,Alicia.
7,3,I'd like you to go immediately if you please.
1,7,Everybody seems to be here
5,1,Hmm
1,5,"Ah, how did you know?"
5,1,What?
1,5,Who's showing her around the house
5,1,"No, she didn't tell the witch she was coming here"
7,5,"Ah, it's you, Snuffkin"
5,7,"Hi, how do you do Sniff?"
7,5,No
1,7,"Well, she could spell the night here, but of course tomorrow will be asleep for the winter, so..."
3,1,"Oh, hello, how are you?"
7,3,"Oh, my dear"
3,7,Can't I stay a little longer?
7,3,"And I told you, that's the trouble"
3,7,"They are disgustingly, signally good"
7,3,"It's really cold out here, and there's a lot more snow on the way"
3,7,"We understand each other now, don't we?"
1,3,Please keep quiet all of you
4,1,Huh?
3,4,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
1,3,"Just what I thought, they're too heavy!"
7,1,"Don't worry, I'm happy to walk home, Grandma!"
3,7,"Don't be so ridiculous, child!"
7,3,You'll never make it!
4,7,I wish they'd sing to the ground so I could fly that room.
1,4,"Guess they're all right now, Mum and Papa."
7,1,"Oh, I forgot to thank them for asking me to stand at dinner."
3,7,"Well, I'm quite happy to help, but the path will certainly be a difficult one."
1,3,"Well, Christmas is almost coming and we don't have a fir tree yet."
7,1,I've got a long way to go.
2,7,Who was that?
1,2,I guess we must decorate the tree to make sure we keep Christmas happy.
7,1,"It will look fantastic on the tree, Papa."
3,7,"Mmm, that looks beautiful."
2,3,He will.
7,2,Imagine everyone in Moomin Valley being frightened.
3,7,You look sleepy.
1,3,"Yes, lovely."
3,1,Stop.
1,3,But there's no one who's just a spare.
3,1,Why don't you take a closer look at it?
1,3,That's not a broom.
4,1,What do you mean?
7,4,Huh?
1,7,"Did you say something, snorkeweider?"
7,1,Your mother's raspberry juice is really the best.
1,7,"He told me all about it last winter, snort maiden."
7,1,Wouldn't it be a good idea to stay up and wait for the sunrise?
3,7,Mom and I don't like this.
7,3,How many times from sight tell you you can't go visiting Moomin Valley.
3,7,Come on.
7,3,"If you want to learn to fly on this broom, Alicia,"
1,7,"Even if you fall, you can't hurt yourself on this soft snow."
7,1,Maybe going out wasn't such a good idea after all.
1,7,"Yes, and everything will be snowed up now to spring."
3,1,There's not much wood left in here.
7,3,Someone else must be burning it.
3,7,"Yes, but who and for what I wonder?"
7,3,I can feel it.
3,7,I'm scared.
7,3,We had a lot of fun here in the summer.
1,7,"Two, Tiki."
7,1,Oh.
1,7,That's all right.
7,1,Moman.
1,7,I thought it might be seeing there's no sun at all.
7,1,"Tell me, Grog."
1,7,"I nearly bumped into her, but I didn't touch her."
7,1,"I must have startled her, I guess."
2,7,"Oh, I was so scared."
7,2,"So am I, women."
1,7,Please tell me you're not serious.
7,1,Where's all that drumming noise coming from?
3,7,How long before everybody arrives?
7,3,I can't see them.
3,7,Oh.
7,3,I just know because they sometimes play them in the batch house as well.
3,7,What's she going?
7,3,But what's she doing?
1,7,"Hold on tight now, Snorkemaid, and I'll be careful."
7,1,Goodbye.
3,7,This time the movements have gone too far.
5,3,"Hello there, Mr. Hemielun."
1,5,I told you so.
5,1,I hate it when others are asleep while I'm up.
1,5,"Bet you anything, moment wakes up when Snuffkin returns."
5,1,I'll go with you.
7,5,"So, where are you going?"
3,7,I thought I'd take some time off to celebrate.
7,3,But what about your work?
3,7,And I know where.
7,3,I only want to see the Moomin's.
5,7,so don't tell anyone for the time being.
7,5,The best thing would be for me to talk to her first.
3,7,"I can hardly believe you could be so mean, Grandma."
7,3,"Calm down, my dear."
3,7,"Why, I did it all for you, Alicia."
7,3,You did it for me.
3,7,"And if I do see the moments, I won't be a witch till I'm 31."
7,3,"They are so disgustingly good, and if you want to be a witch,"
3,7,"Oh, Grandma, that's not a good idea."
7,3,You may be right.
3,7,You do have your harmonica with you?
7,3,"If you don't stop staring at me, my witchcraft won't be effective."
4,7,Hi!
2,4,"Why don't you listen to us, Moom and Papa?"
7,2,"Oh, my man!"
1,7,I can't.
3,1,"You heard it too, Mom and Papa."
1,3,"If you ask me, I believe they're the work of the witch."
3,1,"Goodness, what are you doing out here?"
1,3,They certainly are. Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?
3,1,"I'll tell you what I mean. What I mean is, I don't want to be seen talking with goody-goodies like the moments."
1,3,"No, we wanted to ask her something about that loud noise we hear every night."
3,1,I don't make explosions.
1,3,I really don't know.
3,1,"Why, as young man, a few days ago, I went all the way over to the beach to see what was happening."
1,3,"Thank you very much, Snork Maiden."
2,1,"Oh, of course."
1,2,and is going to be called Himmelensis.
7,1,"Oh, why do you say that?"
2,7,"But, of course."
7,2,Are they pretty?
2,7,Very pretty.
1,2,"Why don't we go and find out about those explosions tonight, huh?"
4,1,"Obviously, or I wouldn't come."
3,4,Why didn't you tell me so I could have come along?
7,3,Ever since I stopped coming to see you?
4,7,They're herbs.
7,4,That's right.
5,7,Oh dear. What does this matter with you?
1,5,"First, we must bring her fever down."
3,1,"Oh, dear. Is she unconscious?"
1,3,"Then why do you think she'd want to come to visit you, Hamilton?"
5,1,Certainly not. Not me.
1,5,"Here, you better take this movement."
3,1,"Well, then, Papa. Why don't you come with us?"
1,3,"All right, Papa. We'll find out about the bangs for you."
3,1,to see. Keep a sharp look out. Look over there. What is it?
