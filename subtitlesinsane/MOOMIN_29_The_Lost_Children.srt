1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I think it's a good idea.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. Here with me, there for you on your TV They are the movements, they are the movements

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So come with me, give me your hand

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll take you up to a moment land

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You can fly just like a bird

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Sing that song ever, there were the movements

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
There were the movements, there was the moments

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There was the moments, there was the moments

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:26,000
There was the moments, and the floating theater had floated away a long time ago.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hmm?

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh...

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, oh, I feel so good. I really slept like a log all night.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,760
It's so lovely to be out in the fresh air with Moomin and a tree in blue.

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,480
No! No! The house is gone! I mean, the theater is gone! What?

22
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,680
Moomin!

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,480
What?

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,159
Wake up, Moomin! Wake up! There's been a catastrophe! Wake up!

25
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,760
What's a catastrophe?

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Look down! The theaters floated off during the night!

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,280
I don't believe it!

28
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,039
It has! It's gone! I can't see it anywhere!

29
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,599
I must be far away by now.

30
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,199
Moon and your father's walking stick.

31
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:28,699
Huh?

32
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,599
It must have got loose in the middle of the night, while everybody was asleep.

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Eeeh...

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Eeeh...

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Eeeh...

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,300
Crying won't solve the problems don't made him.

37
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,500
But we're stranded in the Row you with water all around us.

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

39
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Ha ha ha ha!

40
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Ugh!

41
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Um.

42
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Huh?

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Ugh! Uh-huh. Huh?

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Ah!

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, no! We're in a drift! We're floating away!

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We're drifting away!

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh!

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What are we going to do?

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,439
Moments and snork-maiden are still up in that beautiful row and tree. That's just typical.

50
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,199
Where is it?

51
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,439
And how can we have drifted so far away?

52
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,800
You listen, last night, didn't you?

53
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,439
I told you never to do that in a theater, it brings bad luck.

54
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,439
Hey!

55
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,840
Oh, never.

56
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:47,000
What the fuck? Oh, no! Oh, no! Stop it, Matt! You're too heavy!

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's go!

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Stop it, Matt!

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh, no!

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Little Maya!

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh, no!

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, no!

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That was me, didn't it?

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, dear.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh, little Maya!

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, get this hurry!

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're so mean! And so is you! Help me, little Maya! Little Maya's drifting off! I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I remember this, I'm too scared to get over to your side.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You must be brave, Northmaiden.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll catch you so you won't fall, okay?

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I told you so, the branch didn't break, did it?

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Thank you for saving me.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh!

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Ah!

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Ah! Ah! Whoa! Ah!

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Ah!

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Ah!

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Ah!

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Are you all right, Newman?

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can stand up, Snorkemaiden!

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Look, the water's only ankle deep!

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Really?

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Ah!

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Ah!

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Ah!

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Ah!

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Are you all right, Snorkemaiden?

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes, it's so shallow. It's getting dark isn't it?

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh?

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes! Try lamb!

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Look there!

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
A fire!

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Must be people over there.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:55,959
Yes!

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,720
Of course I forgotten tonight's mid-summer eve! What a strange catch. So the moolens split up.

95
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Are they in trouble, little my?

96
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, seems I was probably the luckiest one as usual.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
More!

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,480
I'm sorry you can't have anymore.

99
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,439
That's all I have.

100
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,759
I don't believe you, your bag's still full.

101
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,920
Yes, but not with food little my.

102
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,680
What's in it then?

103
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,920
You'll soon find out.

104
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Where are we going?

105
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
To a park.

106
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:19,000
I hope there's a hot dog stand there. There.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,680
Those two over there are the park keeper and his wife. Look! They're always watching. They guard a lot of poor orphans

108
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:47,000
who come to the park every day. Really? Look over there. Hey, what's this?

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey kids!

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Come on everybody, we're here to let you out! Come quickly, hurry!

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What? We can't go anywhere! We have to sit right here so they can see us!

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah, otherwise they might lose one of us!

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What a lot of signs! No walking on grass, no shit! We have to sit right here so they can see us. Yeah, otherwise they might lose one of us.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What a lot of signs. No walking on grass.

115
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
No shouting. No running.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What a lot of rules.

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What are they good for, Snuffkin?

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Nothing. Nothing at all.

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And that's why we're gonna pull them up.

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No, you mustn't.

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't think one is allowed to do that.

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,600
And you have to walk on the grass.

123
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,800
Yes indeed. And I really like walking on the grass.

124
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,000
I always have.

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Bah.

126
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,600
No butts. Come on everybody. Let's make a start.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,600
That looks like fun. I'll pull some too.

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What are you doing? Can't you read? There's a sign saying it's forbidden to pull a charge!

129
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This one? Yeah!

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh, wow!

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Huh!

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Oh!

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh!

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh!

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh, oh!

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh!

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,399
I'm beautiful, sign! Bye-bye! Oh

138
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
There you free go run Stop! Wait! Come on! What the hell is this noise? How did goodness...

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Those little balls are shining!

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Come on!

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh!

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh!

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Daddy's batter!

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Quick, right, those were haddy-fat receipts.

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,600
Come on, everybody, run! Oh, no!

146
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Oh, no!

147
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Oh, no!

148
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Get out of here!

149
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Help!

150
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Help!

151
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Someone help!

152
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Help!

153
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
The raster, me!

154
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Get down!

155
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Get away, quick!

156
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
That's terrible!

157
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Where could that floating theater have gone? They're still following us.

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Come on, you kids.

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You can go wherever you want.

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Do what you like.

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, but I don't know what I want.

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Me neither.

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No, me.

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,299
I think they want to go with you, Snuffkin. But I don't know what I want. Me neither. No, me. I think they want to go with you, Snuffkin.

165
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:29,299
But I don't know anything about small children.

166
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:31,299
I'm not sure I even like them.

167
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,299
All we have to do is find a theater.

168
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,500
Mumin' mama will know what to do.

169
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:58,480
In that case, let's go. Oh!

170
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,000
A house! Yes, and look! All the lights are on!

171
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,759
Maybe they're celebrating with some relief. Shall we go there? Yes.

172
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Oh.

173
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,000
Last.

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh. Hello, Happy Mid-Summer. Oh! Alast! Oh!

175
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Hello, Happy Mid-Summer!

176
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Thank you! Happy Mid-Summer!

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What can I do for you?

178
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Would you have seen a theater drifting around somewhere, ma'am?

179
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
A theater?

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes, you see a drifted away in the flood, and my powers are on it!

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, dear, I haven't seen anything like that.

182
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, what a pity!

183
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Thank you! We'll look elsewhere.

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Have a nice midsummer party.

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Party?

186
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh yes, a party. Thank you very much.

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Very well then. I'll say good night.

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Did we say something wrong, Momen?

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't know.

190
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What's the matter? I think she's crying. Oh.

191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Hello.

192
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Is there anything we can do? Anything at all?

193
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Aren't you having a party, ma'am?

194
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,600
No, unfortunately, she's not coming this year either.

195
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,799
Who is she?

196
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:33,799
My aunt and my father's side. I invite her every year for a mid-some-a-party, but she never comes.

197
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:36,799
How sad! You must be very fond of her.

198
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,299
Oh no, she's an awful person.

199
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,299
If that's how you feel about her, why don't you invite someone else?

200
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:46,120
She's my only relative.

201
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,720
So invite someone who isn't a relative?

202
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,600
Yes, why don't you invite us, for instance?

203
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,720
Oh.

204
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,960
Can one really do things like that? Just like that?

205
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,639
Of course one can.

206
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,519
Oh, marvelous.

207
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,480
To be perfectly honest, we're very hungry.

208
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,000
Ah, I've made lots of extra pancakes.

209
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,200
Please come in and join me.

210
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Thank you.

211
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,799
Although we have drifted apart tonight,

212
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,799
is Midsummer's Eve?

213
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,399
Let's drink a toast to Mum and Snork Maiden and Little Mai

214
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,600
and hope that they're safe.

215
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,799
And we better drink to that no-good niece of mine, I guess.

216
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,299
Who's that, Emma?

217
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:26,860
My only relative.

218
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,659
She lives all alone in a small house by the sea.

219
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:32,259
Oh, is she all alone from its summer?

220
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:33,059
Probably.

221
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,399
Always invites me over for pancakes.

222
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,899
I don't like relatives, and I don't like pancakes,

223
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:40,299
and she's boring, so I don't go.

224
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:42,980
Well, let's toast her anyway, and here's hoping

225
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,000
we'll all be together again very soon.

226
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Cheers!

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Cheers!

228
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Good health!

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, that was really good. Everything was delicious!

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I think I've eaten too much.

231
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, please have some more. Oh, this is so nice.

232
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I couldn't eat another thing.

233
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, sad. It's such fun having someone to cook for.

234
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,360
I'm so pleased you're not at my door.

235
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,600
All that's missing now is a bonfire.

236
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,000
We always have one on mid-summer eve.

237
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,840
What a good idea.

238
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Let's have one.

239
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Over there.

240
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840
Oh, no!

241
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
No!

242
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
No!

243
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
No!

244
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
No!

245
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
No!

246
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,000
No! No! So hard! So hard!

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So hard, you can't do that.

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
See these?

249
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The flood brought all of them.

250
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
They were lying all over the place,

251
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
so I tied them into one big pile.

252
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Would they make a good bonfire?

253
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, a terrific one!

254
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:59,440
Definitely!

255
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh wow! Wow! We've walked for miles, but I can't see signs of a theater anywhere.

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh, don't worry. We'll find it soon.

257
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Huh?

258
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And what's the matter with you?

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm hungry.

260
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Me too.

261
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And me.

262
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I can't walk anymore.

263
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We don't have any food.

264
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If you want food, you'll have to look for it yourselves.

265
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh, don't cry.

266
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Look over there, little lion.

267
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Over there, hidden behind the trees.

268
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Whoa, I have.

269
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And the lights are on.

270
00:15:40,000 --> 00:16:10,000
We're safe! Oh! Oh! Oh! Hey, kids, you can't go eating other people's food.

271
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You can if they are home and it's just what's left over from a party.

272
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
In fact, I will have some myself.

273
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's amazing I'm always so black.

274
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh!

275
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Now we must pick nine flowers. Why is that Snorke-Middon?

276
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't really know. It's always nine or seven of something.

277
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Okay, nine flowers.

278
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
No, not the same kind. You must pick nine different flowers.

279
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And then what do you do?

280
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You turn around seven times like this.

281
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I get it.

282
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And then you walk backward until you reach a well.

283
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And then when you look down into the well,

284
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
there you'll see the man you're going to marry.

285
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
How do you get him up?

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I think I see him. What a clever well.

287
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That I must try.

288
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'd like someone more romantic. Got you!

289
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What are you doing?

290
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm quietly now.

291
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh!

292
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, we did!

293
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,359
It's picked some unprotected wildflowers.

294
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,559
I know what you did.

295
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,400
Hey, snorke my nun!

296
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,519
Moonman!

297
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,039
Ha! You know each other.

298
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,480
That makes it conspiracy.

299
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,440
But I tell you, we've done nothing wrong, nothing at all.

300
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,720
We were only celebrating.

301
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,920
Better for you, if you haven't.

302
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,759
But why?

303
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:03,440
Can't you light a bonfire here, sir?

304
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,700
I must warn you that all you say will be used against you.

305
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:10,140
Ah, shhh, shhh, I have a complaint from the park, keeper.

306
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:13,059
You pulled up these signs from his park and you burnt them.

307
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,299
That's not true!

308
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:17,740
It is true that we burnt them, sir, but we didn't take them from any park.

309
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:19,500
They were brought here by the flood.

310
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,599
Boulder-dash, here's the evidence!

311
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,759
Oh...

312
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,000
I've caught you when that's that!

313
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh, I caught something!

314
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh, it's just a piece of wood!

315
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Had any ideas here?

316
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Not a single one. How about you, mama?

317
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Same here, I'm afraid.

318
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,619
I just can't seem to think of anything at all.

319
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:46,619
Oh, yeah.

320
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,599
You wouldn't have any ideas about what we should do next,

321
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,440
would you, Emma?

322
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,559
About what?

323
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,880
Some ideas about how to let the children know

324
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,599
where we are, of course.

325
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,079
How does anyone know where a theater is?

326
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,180
I don't know. Please tell us.

327
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,319
Well, you put on a play. A play? Yes, that is correct.

328
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,920
This is a theater and when you put on a new play,

329
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,680
everybody comes walking to see it. They come to laugh, to cry, to shout, and to applaud.

330
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,440
And when your children hear of it, they will be hearing a flash.

331
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,000
What a splendid idea, Emma.

332
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That's exactly what we'll do.

333
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Hmm, I'm sorry, we can't put on a play.

334
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Why not?

335
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We have no actors. They are pests, but one can't do without them.

336
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I can be one.

337
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And I'm also quite good at acting.

338
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I can act very well.

339
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,680
There are only three of you and not one of you

340
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:53,039
as an experienced professional actor. The don't forget we have you Emma. Me? Well, I've all

341
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:59,519
felt that I would make a rather good Shakespearean heroine. And we can each have many parts as long

342
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,279
as they're not all on the stage at the same time. He's not at so moment, Papa. Of course it's possible to do it.

343
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,200
I want the part that finds the treasure.

344
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,359
No, that's impossible.

345
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,000
We have no play.

346
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,200
Nothing simple enough for the likes of you.

347
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,759
A moment, Papa, can write one.

348
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,440
He's very talented.

349
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,039
No trouble at all, my dear.

350
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,640
Any number of acts.

351
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,000
But we don't want any number.

352
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,279
We want three acts.

353
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,079
That's what all proper plays always have,
