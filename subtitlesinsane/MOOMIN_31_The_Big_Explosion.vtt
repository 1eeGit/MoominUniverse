    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're here for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They are the movements.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, what do you think?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm going to say that I'm not going to say it. I'm going to say it. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, There was the moment, there was the moments

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:10.000
There was the moments, there was the moments One night, the moment was having a dream.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
What a wonderful feeling to be flying like this!

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Look over there, woman! What a beautiful lake!

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This is one of the most fantastic experiences I've ever had!

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.799
Me too! I never knew birds had such a marvelous life.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.599
Seeing things from a completely different point of view.

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:34.799
We're flying pretty high aren't we?

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.799
I'm scared.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.599
We're much too high.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.799
Let's go down please. Let's go down at once.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.400
I'm not scared of heights.

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:50.200
Oh, Snork, this time you really have succeeded.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.799
Will I could build hundreds of these if you wanted me to?

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:58.799
Snork, can I steer it just for a little while? Now you can.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.799
Huh?

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:06.000
Oh, stinky. Do you really know how to steer this thing? Yeah!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Hey! Stop it, stinky!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
That's dangerous!

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
This is okay, really! It's just a dream!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Oh, right. Oh gosh, my head hurt so...

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
What a strange dream!

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Why would my brother let stinky stare his flying ship?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Surely not.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I was talking to a snork while I looked away, suddenly stinky took his place.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Oh, and then the thing began tilting?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Hmm, but it was just a dream.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I don't care, I don't like it.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
You shouldn't have dreams like that just when my brother's flying ship is almost ready.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Dreams often come true, you know.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
But it was nothing like the ship your brother's building, it was totally different.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But tell me what happened to it in the end. Did it fall down?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I don't know. I lost sight of it when I fell off and I didn't see it again.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Well, surely you could have turned your hat to take a look.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Well, I didn't.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Listen, Mum, and don't say a word to the snork about this.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
He's nervous enough as it is.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Of course not. Why don't we just forget about it? Pretend it never happened, eh?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Oh, snork, it's finally completed.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Sure it is, but it hasn't been flown yet, of course.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But it will, I won't, Snork. You don't think there's anything wrong with it?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Of course not, but it's just...

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Is there some problem, Snork?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Well, there might be.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So, what is it?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Fuel.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Fuel?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.439
But you said you had developed a new fuel that was really good. It's good,

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:13.080
but you see you see it might not be powerful enough. You mean it might not be able to

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.620
fly? No it won't. You're quite right. Or it will just be an ordinary ship, not a flying

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:29.439
ship. Oh that would be nice. What can't go up can't possibly fall down. But that's not the point if it won't fly. Everyone will laugh at me. I know they will.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.199
I won't laugh, I promise.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.519
Maybe not. Others will.

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:38.800
But you wouldn't care about that, would you? Who cares what other people think?

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.639
The thing is, I've already told people that the test flight will be quite soon. In public.

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.860
But I'm sure people will be very nice about it even if it doesn't get off the ground.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.220
That's hardly what I want.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.540
Moomin, I'd like to ask you a favor.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.699
That's why I sent for you. Will you help me?

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.300
I'll do anything you ask, Snork, of course.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.000
What I would like is for you, Moomin, my friend, to be test pilot for me tomorrow.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:43.000
You want me to be a pilot? Hey, stinky stinky! Oh, Mom! Listen, stinky, I'm going to steer that shivers up perfectly clear.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
You're not to touch the wheel. I'm the pilot now.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
What on earth was that a bird?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Wouldn't you find it difficult to steer it?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Oh no, it's real easy. But of course, I'd need to practice before the public demonstration.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Is the snorke going to fly his own ship?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
He'll be there but he has to stay down in the engine room snuff can.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I wonder if this ship will really fly.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
The only problem is the fuel.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Only the fuel you say. That's a big problem.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I suppose so.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Listen, Roman. Suppose now the snorke's flying ship really gets off the ground.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Well, of course it's going to, Papa.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
That something could happen, something could break,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
or you could fall into an air pocket.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
It's such a dangerous undertaking, think, moment.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Papa!

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Now, listen, it's not natural for the moment to fly about up in the air.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Is it snuffkin'?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.100
Quite right.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.699
Well, when do you and the snorke do if things went wrong?

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.199
We will be wearing parachutes, you know?

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.699
Parachutes.

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.199
You do know what they are, don't you, Papa?

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:55.500
Of course I do.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.500
They come down from the sky like this, like this.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.699
Exactly.

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.100
But of course, we won't need a parachute.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.600
Because nothing will go wrong.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.139
And I will be the first flying ship pilot ever.

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:11.620
Oh.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.540
Hi there.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.860
Hello, my young man.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.819
Hello.

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:16.620
How do you do?

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.300
How do you do everybody?

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.100
Hello, sir.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.100
Hello, sir.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.100
I wonder if you can help me.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.000
Do you happen to know where the snorks factory is?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.600
Eh? You mean the sherd?

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.199
I must see him.

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:31.600
I'm most eager to have a look at his famous flying ship.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.600
How do you know about that?

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.800
It's supposed to be very secret.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.399
The information must have leaked out somehow.

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:42.000
Oh well, all inventors know about what he is trying to do.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.399
He's famous throughout Moomin Valley this snork.

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:54.480
Really? Are you an inventor too? Indeed I am. One of the more famous. I think maybe the most famous of them all.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.480
I am Moomin Papa. How do you do sir? I'm Snuffkin.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:06.000
And my name is Moomin. Please to meet you. A very good date you won and all. The muffles, my name.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I said I'm the muffled.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
You mean you've never even heard of me the most famous inventor.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Oh yes, I'm sure I am. The muffled isn't it? Yes, it is the muffled.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.300
Have you invented anything exciting, muffuffle? Mr. Muffle?

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:31.300
Ah, it would be much easier to tell you what I haven't invented young man.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.779
For instance, the pin that can't prick because it has two heads.

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:39.559
The newspaper that reads itself, the purse that moans and groans if you take money from

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:42.779
it, the adhesive tape that sticks only to itself.

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:46.620
This is perhaps the greatest of all my latest inventions.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.840
Whatever is that?

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.860
This is proper self a man powered fan.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.860
Infanible in muddy weather.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:54.860
Oh!

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.860
Oh!

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.860
Oh!

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:57.860
Oh!

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.860
Oh!

00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.860
Oh!

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:00.860
Oh!

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.860
Oh!

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.860
Oh!

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.860
Oh!

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.860
Oh!

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, these are my latest inventions.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
You didn't know that did you?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
No, it isn't.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
But try and give her handkerchief, the square balloon,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
the five wheeled car, the hexagonal frying pan,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
the seven hole button, and a host of others.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Indeed, how interesting.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
What did you want to see the snork about?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
I thought I might be able to help him out

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
with one of my inventions. That's what?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Oh, Jill, which one?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
My new?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
No, it's very top-sequence stuff I can tell you.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Now, where is the snork's factory?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I'll take you right there.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Very kind of you.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.600
Come, he'll be so surprised.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.600
Must be off. See you again.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.799
It's a pleasure to help these buddy inventors.

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:51.799
Snurker will be so excited.

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:54.299
A famous inventor, eh?

00:09:54.299 --> 00:09:56.299
What is your opinion, Snurfkin?

00:09:56.299 --> 00:09:59.299
Have you ever seen a triangular hanker chief, Moomin Papa?

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:02.100
No, and I don't want to either.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.440
I do wonder what he's cooked up for the snork, though.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.159
It is sort of intriguing.

00:10:07.159 --> 00:10:08.279
Yes, indeed.

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:10.679
We'll be able to tell us later, I suppose.

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:13.159
Yes, but anything could happen before then.

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:15.159
Can we wait that long, snuffkin?

00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:16.159
You're right.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:21.039
No, wait for me.

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:22.200
I'm coming with you.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.899
Oh, I thought we had several guests!

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:50.000
Now where in the world to, I wonder?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Oh, look who's coming!

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
What are you doing here? We're just interested, Dan. Where are the mufflers and the snorke?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
The snorke and the mufflers are discussing some top secret project.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It's very harsh.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Not a triangular hanker chief, I hope.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I don't know, Papa.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
As I said, it's top secret.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Let's see.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Oh, bother.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
The curtains in the back are all over the place. I don't know, Papa. As I said, it's top secret. Mm-hmm, let's see.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.799
Oh, Father, the curtains in the way, so I can't see a thing.

00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:38.759
So this is the powerful fuel you've developed, is it, Mr. Muffel?

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:39.759
Yes, it is.

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:42.519
Not as original as my other inventions I admit.

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:43.519
But very useful.

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:44.519
Yes, useful.

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:45.879
I call it super fuel.

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:50.639
Only trouble is my engine has been designed for liquid fuel.

00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:52.440
No problem at all young man.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.879
If you dissolve this block of fuel in 10 liters of water,

00:11:55.879 --> 00:11:59.000
your engine will run for at least 10 hours.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.240
For 10 whole hours, that's incredible.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.919
If you doubt the word of the muffler,

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:07.000
then try it out and see for yourself right now.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Right now?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Better still, I guarantee that if used as it is in a solid state, your engine will run not for ten, but for one hundred hours.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
A hundred hours, but that's incredible. You really must be some inventor.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Indeed, if what you say is true, it would solve the last problem of my flying ship.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Oh, now that I've looked more closely at the padlock, this store isn't locked.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
No, it isn't.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Hmm, so if one wanted to see the snorke, one could work right here.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
But why would you want to see him, Papa?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Well, why don't you tell us?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.559
I don't want snorke falling for one of the muffles crazy ideas, that's why.

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:48.559
Well, we'll find out pretty soon.

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:52.240
Maybe you don't realize it, but the snork is pretty clever, you know.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.039
I think I know exactly what they're doing in there.

00:12:56.039 --> 00:12:57.559
Yeah, what?

00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:02.559
I saw that man pouring something into the flying ship.

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:03.559
What was it?

00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:05.559
Well, I guess it must have been fuel, movement.

00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:07.159
How come you show him?

00:13:07.159 --> 00:13:09.600
There's a crack that's just about wide enough for me.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.299
But I won't tell you where.

00:13:11.299 --> 00:13:13.399
What are those two in there talking about?

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:14.639
Oh, yeah?

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:16.799
So this is the great super fuel?

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:17.960
Wait a minute, Snark.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.559
There must be something wrong with it.

00:13:19.559 --> 00:13:20.360
Yeah, you are.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.159
What the...

00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:22.240
How do you do it?

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.240
There you are.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.879
Solid fuel indeed, huh?

00:13:24.879 --> 00:13:26.000
100 hours?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.559
You're an imposter, sir.

00:13:27.559 --> 00:13:30.759
Oh, it isn't true if you just let me explain.

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:31.879
No, thank you.

00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:33.879
I know very well why you came over here

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:37.360
with that ridiculous story off with you right now.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.559
Listen to me.

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:42.399
It is not ridiculous, and it is not just a story.

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:45.000
Maybe we shouldn't have dissolved it in the water.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.159
That was a mistake.

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:47.080
Imposter!

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.960
But I'm the muffler!

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.960
Oh!

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.080
Well, maybe it's just a misunderstanding

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.200
and the fuel isn't suited for flying ships.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.879
Wrong, it suits everything!

00:13:54.879 --> 00:13:56.320
Forget the fuel!

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.240
That was just a trick so we could come here

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.639
and get to see my flying ship.

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:03.639
So the muffler has come here to spy me.

00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:04.919
Ridiculous!

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:05.500
I don't steal!

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.000
Papa, was there anything you wanted to see me about?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Eh?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
No, I just dropped by.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
No cause for excitement.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.500
The fuels are done.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.500
No, it's not. That's not true.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.500
I don't invent guns. What would be the point of inventing them?

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.500
Oh, listen to me, please.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.500
Let's try and use the fuel once more.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.000
No, thanks. Once was once too many.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I'll have to clean my tanks from your gunge.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Get out of my sight!

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Oh, dear, this must have been a bit of a disappointment for the snork.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.159
I know.

00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:55.639
Now listen, stinky.

00:14:55.639 --> 00:14:58.840
I'm doing this for the snorksake, isn't that so?

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.279
I don't care if you're doing it for all I want is to get a good look at the famous flying ship.

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:07.159
You'd need something very powerful to get a thing like that off the ground.

00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:11.200
Something so powerful that only I, the muffle, could ever have invented it.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.799
Remind me one day to show you my famous triangular handkerchief.

00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:19.639
Now all we have to do is not dissolve the fuel in water but use the solid fuel.

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:24.399
Hurry up with that log, Sticky, or maybe I should invent a log pick.

00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:25.480
Come on, sticky.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.480
Hurry, hurry.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.559
There you are done.

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:31.679
Good come, we don't have much time.

00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:33.559
No, I'm dying to steer this ship.

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:37.080
Oh, me up.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.000
Take it up to 2,000 meters.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Yeah.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.519
Whoa.

00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:44.240
Oh, sticky, sticky.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.320
We're flying at a height of just over 2,000 meters now.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.320
stinky!

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.639
Yeah, I'm listening, what is it?

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:52.240
When you hear me say now, that's when I want you

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.440
to start up the engine immediately.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.960
All right, no problem.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.480
Guess it must be this one.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.720
No, no, not yet.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.840
This is it!

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.879
Just a drop of water on the fuel block.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:04.519
Now that should do it.

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:06.000
Can I start it now?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Not yet!

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Alright!

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Now start on the interesting key!

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Now you answer!

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Did you really turn on the switch?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Yes I did!

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
The engine won't start.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Are you quite sure you turned the one I pointed out to you?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I think so. Maybe I turned the wrong one.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
There. Outside these two is well.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Come on, stinky. This is no joke. My reputation is a famous inventor. Is it steak?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
This should do it, I think. Is that work, Mr. Mapple?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.600
Nothing is happening. I do. I shouldn't have let you do it better to do it myself.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.759
You're useless.

00:16:46.759 --> 00:16:48.080
Wait, Mr. Mapple.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.159
I haven't tried the very last one in the row.

00:16:50.159 --> 00:16:50.960
This one switched.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.200
What?

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.480
I better throw that one too.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.399
You never know. It might just do the trick.

00:16:55.399 --> 00:16:56.399
Oh.

00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:57.399
Oh.

00:16:57.399 --> 00:16:58.399
Oh.

00:16:58.399 --> 00:16:59.399
Oh.

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:00.399
Oh.

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.399
Oh.

00:17:01.399 --> 00:17:02.399
Oh.

00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:03.399
Oh.

00:17:03.399 --> 00:17:04.400
It works.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.000
It works. I know it works. I know it works. Oh. It works! It works! I know it works!

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I know it works!

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
It is working!

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I'm not surprised, but I'm so pleased with myself.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
You should be here, Snort. This is my great moment, and you should be here to share it with me.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Come on, I can't wait to try this thing.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Incredible! This ship shall rise like a Phoenix.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Not the most demanding thing, but this is one of my diesel inventions.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.240
Ha, ha! Ha!

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.500
Casper! Casper!

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.500
Winner!

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Come on, let's go! Come on!

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Sheer power!

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
I don't think he ever has started up.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I very much have created exploding!

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Hey stinky religions exploding!

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Where the fuck are you going?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
A bad shit!

00:18:26.000 --> 00:19:02.000
It's going to explode any minute by a wonderful invention! Hmm? Ah!

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Oh! Oh! Now come to your nice room on the small side but the very best one.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
That explosion...it really was most unexpected officer.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Everybody knows you're a great inventor. I wonder if you could help me Mr. Muffle.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
But how?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.200
Could you think of something to protect my roses while you're staying with us?

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.200
A non-explosive, of course.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.200
Of course I could.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.799
Piece of cake, officer.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.599
Oh, I really did want to fly.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Come, come now, cheer up, snorke dear.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.599
Here you are, a nice cup of tea.

00:19:44.599 --> 00:19:45.960
Thanks.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.960
Oh.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.480
It's very strange, but I had a dream the other night about a flying ship.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.119
Did you really move in? That sounds very interesting.

00:19:56.119 --> 00:19:57.799
Yes, very interesting.

00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:59.599
Moment, tell me about it.

00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:06.160
Yes. It was a peculiar looking ship totally different from Northline ships, Snork.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.160
Different?

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.160
Oh.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.599
Well, it was sort of round like this.

00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:16.400
It had a propeller and something hanging underneath.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.839
And we flew over a high mountain.

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:20.839
Round?

00:20:20.839 --> 00:20:21.839
Yes.

00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:24.440
And you were in a sort of thing hanging underneath.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.000
Yes. Round. were in a sort of thing hanging underneath. Yes.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Round.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Round, huh?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Round.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
What, ever's the match I snuck?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
What?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Oh, mama.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Thanks for the tea.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
I think I'm getting a new idea.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Moving.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
See you later.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Papa, I must go.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.960
Oh, there he goes again. I know that, see you later. Papa, I must go. Oh, fair he goes again.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.400
I know that, look, Mama.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.000
You won't get an intelligent answer out of him for the next month or so, honestly.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.799
I'm very happy for him.

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:58.200
I must say that was a very clever dream you had, woman.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.039
I'm a better inventor than the mobile.

00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:04.000
You deserve a triangular acruchy.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000
So the explosion didn't distress the sword for long.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Soon he was back at his favorite occupation, planning.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
But planning what?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Rome.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Rome? Wrong
