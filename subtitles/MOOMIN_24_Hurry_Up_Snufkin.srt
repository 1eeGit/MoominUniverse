1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,560
here they are for one and all the moments are about to come on and sit down here with

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:32,800
me there for you on your TV they are the moments they are the moments so come with me give me your hand

3
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:41,680
I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there with the

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:59,120
moment there was a moments there was the moments there was the moments

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:41,680
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

6
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:53,920
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. It's spring again in

7
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,620
Mumen Valley and after their long winter hibernation, everyone is awake and enjoying the sunshine

8
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,500
in the flowers.

9
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,220
Everyone that is except for mumen was in bed with a terrible cold.

10
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,620
Oh dear mumen, that's a nasty cough.

11
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,180
My throat is very sore.

12
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,380
This will help soothe it.

13
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,940
It's one of grandma's best potions.

14
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,500
It's hard.

15
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,940
Never mind, nice tasting medicines don't always work as well.

16
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,540
I wanted to go out, it's spring.

17
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,740
I know dear, but you'd catch pneumonia or something.

18
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:54,060
Oh mama, does anyone know why snuff can't come back here?

19
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,020
No, perhaps spring came earlier this year and he wasn't ready.

20
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,020
Snuff can not always come back to mumen valley on the very first day of spring,

21
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,100
but not this year.

22
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,260
Snuff kill.

23
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:24,940
I'm mumen papa, is mumen any better?

24
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,580
No, I'm afraid not, he's still got a nasty cough.

25
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,180
Can I go up and see him?

26
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,940
No, you'd better not, you might catch it.

27
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,020
Papa's right, sniff, and you know how poorly you get when you're ill.

28
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,460
It's best not to take the risk.

29
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,700
I should think he'll be up and about before very long.

30
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,540
Yes, it's better to be safe than sorry.

31
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,860
Woman shouldn't have gone out in the winter, should he mama?

32
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,540
No, but he couldn't go back to sleep.

33
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,780
Snow would have that effect on anyone.

34
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,700
Not you, little Mai was out in the cold with him and look at her, she seems healthy enough.

35
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,020
I'll take these flowers to mumen later.

36
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
Little Mai's too small to catch a cold.

37
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,340
This is boring.

38
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,780
I can't believe that mumen's sick.

39
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,780
And Snuff gets not back either.

40
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,740
I sure wonder what's happened to him.

41
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,340
I bet you mumen gets better as soon as Snuff can arrive in mumen valley.

42
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,380
He's never been this late coming back before.

43
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,420
Perhaps he's got fed up with you guys.

44
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,380
Impossible, he's very fond of me.

45
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,460
He's told me so lots of times.

46
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,380
He likes mumen too, of course.

47
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,420
He might have been captured by a highway man.

48
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,300
Let's go and look for him.

49
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,060
The highway man?

50
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,340
First Snuff can silly.

51
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,420
He's got to come back so mumen will get better.

52
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,020
We must find him.

53
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,620
But where do we look Snork Maiden?

54
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,300
In the south.

55
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,340
It's a big place.

56
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,380
He could be anywhere.

57
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,620
Well, I don't care how big it is.

58
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,740
I'm going anyway.

59
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,020
You're being silly.

60
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,900
No, I'm not.

61
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,500
I don't think your brother will like it.

62
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,700
In fact, I know he won't.

63
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,900
Have you gone completely bananas?

64
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,340
No, I haven't.

65
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,340
And you'll just have to make your own muffins.

66
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,340
There's more to food than muffins.

67
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,580
I was speaking figuratively.

68
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,580
Anyway, I'm going to your brother

69
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,980
and nothing you can do or say will stop me.

70
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,580
It's for mumen.

71
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,820
That's a sort of hairbrain scheme

72
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,580
that could only have been dreamed up by you.

73
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,620
What good will it do?

74
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,220
You don't even know where he is.

75
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,100
It is not.

76
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,780
Mumen is pining for Snuffkin.

77
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,460
Rubbish.

78
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,220
Men don't pine for their friends.

79
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,940
If he isn't back yet, then he isn't coming.

80
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,140
And if he isn't going to come,

81
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,980
what's the point of looking for him?

82
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,420
You won't find him anyway.

83
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,380
He will come when he knows that Mumen is sick.

84
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,220
Black males just like a sister.

85
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,900
Something done for love could never be black male.

86
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,060
Oh no, you're not going and that's fine.

87
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,940
Look, why don't you and little Mai go by yourselves?

88
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,340
Oh, well, I didn't really make a definite decision.

89
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,260
I just sort of said that I might come along

90
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,780
that if Snort Maiden isn't going,

91
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,540
there doesn't seem any point.

92
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,580
Does there?

93
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,940
And I'm not going because I think it's stupid and hairbrain too.

94
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,620
Snuffkin will come back soon.

95
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,820
Not Snort Maiden.

96
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,940
What do you say to that?

97
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,020
How is Mumen feeling any better?

98
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,660
He's asleep now, but the cough doesn't seem so bad.

99
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,660
And is temperature still quite high?

100
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,220
Already.

101
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,140
Snort Maiden Moan.

102
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Snort Maiden.

103
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,780
And my pleas to see you, Moomin.

104
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,780
You look like you needed a lift.

105
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,780
This magic cloud must be one of those we got from the Hobgoblins top hat.

106
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,780
That's right. I hid one of them away.

107
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,780
What a good idea, Moomin. You are clever.

108
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,780
Well, it was so much fun to last time, wasn't it?

109
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,780
Hi, Moomin! Hi! Hi!

110
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,780
Oh, look, Snuffkin. I didn't know they were here, too.

111
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,780
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

112
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,780
Snuffkin!

113
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,780
Oh! Oh! Oh!

114
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,780
Moomin!

115
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,780
Snuffkin!

116
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,780
Oh, oh!

117
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,780
Oh! Oh!

118
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,780
Moomin!

119
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,780
Snuffkin!

120
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,780
Oh! Oh!

121
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,780
Oh! Oh!

122
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,780
Oh! Oh!

123
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,780
Oh!

124
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,780
That was just a dream.

125
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,780
Snuffkin!

126
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,780
Oh!

127
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,780
You look blousy, Moomin.

128
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,780
Oh, thanks, stinky. You'd better keep away.

129
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,780
There's no need bugs and things like that. Stay away from me.

130
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,780
They're probably frightened of someone so healthy.

131
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,780
Mama isn't letting anyone in here. It's very dull.

132
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,780
You followed a bed or something? Yes, I did.

133
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,780
I know. You were dreaming, weren't you?

134
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,780
Unfortunately, yes.

135
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,780
I know how you feel.

136
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,780
I have that dream a lot.

137
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,780
Oh.

138
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,780
You stand on a windowsill getting ready to break the glass

139
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,780
and inside there's diamonds.

140
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,780
And then, Moomin, you fall.

141
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,780
It's not the same dream at all, stinky.

142
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,780
Snuffkin hasn't come back yet.

143
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,780
Have you heard anything from him? He's very late.

144
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,780
Ah, Snuffkin.

145
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,780
You know something, don't you?

146
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,780
All I know is that he went away as usual last autumn

147
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,780
and hasn't come back yet.

148
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,780
And then...

149
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,780
Yes, what?

150
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,780
Snork Maiden wanted to go looking for him

151
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,780
because he thinks that if Snuffkin comes back,

152
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,780
he won't be sick anymore, but snork with a letter.

153
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,780
Snork Maiden?

154
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,780
Hey, Snork Maiden!

155
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,780
Snork Maiden!

156
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,780
You're not serious, are you?

157
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,780
I feel perfectly all right.

158
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,780
You look like that's warmed up if you ask me.

159
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,780
Thanks a lot.

160
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,780
Now, stinky, tell me which way does Snuffkin normally travel south?

161
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,780
Hey, are you going looking for him?

162
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,780
Yes, it's not really spring in Moomin Valley if he's not around.

163
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,780
It's just not right somehow.

164
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,780
Okay, you're all as mad as each other.

165
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,780
But you'll help me?

166
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,780
I've got to try and find him, stinky.

167
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,780
Yes, all right, but don't tell your parents I helped you.

168
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,780
Don't worry, I want to say a thing.

169
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,780
Sorry, stinky. Are you okay?

170
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,780
No, I'm fine.

171
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,780
Here's your lunch, Moomin. How are you feeling?

172
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,780
Moomin?

173
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,780
Papa, come here quickly.

174
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,780
Mmm.

175
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,780
Oh, Papa, Moomin's gone. He's not in his bed.

176
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,780
Not in his bed? Are you sure, Mama?

177
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,780
Of course I am. His room is empty and there's no sign of him.

178
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,780
Perhaps he's in one of the other rooms.

179
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,780
Don't worry, Mama, I'll find him.

180
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,780
Yo, Moomin.

181
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,780
Moomin.

182
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,780
Hi, Moomin, Papa.

183
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,780
Oh, little Mai.

184
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,780
What's wrong? You look worried.

185
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,780
A moment's gone up somewhere.

186
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,780
I expect you must have gone to look for Snuffkin.

187
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
Snuffkin?

188
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,780
Well, you know how crazy Moomin is about him.

189
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,780
Bit stupid if you ask me.

190
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,780
But he's not well, he's got a fever.

191
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:26,780
You're sure this is the right way?

192
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,780
Of course I'm sure.

193
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,780
I'll see you tomorrow.

194
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,780
Bye.

195
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,780
Bye.

196
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,780
Bye.

197
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,380
Are you sure this is the right way?

198
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,980
Of course I'm sure. I live in this forest, don't I?

199
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,980
Why don't we miss each other somewhere?

200
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,980
Well, if you think you might, don't go then. It's up to you.

201
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,480
But I've got to...

202
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,680
H-h-h-h-h-h-h!

203
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,180
Mumin!

204
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,280
Oh, snorke me, son!

205
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Uh-huh.

206
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Uh-huh.

207
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Where are you taking him, Stinky? You can see he's not well.

208
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,280
I'm not taking him. He insisted on going. I came to look after him.

209
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Is that really right, Mumin?

210
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,080
Yes, I wanted to find snuffkins, so he'd come back.

211
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,080
Well, I was going to find him for you. Little mind's sniff were coming too,

212
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,280
but they chickened out, so I came on my own.

213
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,280
What did Snorke say about that?

214
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
I bet he wasn't happy.

215
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Oh, he made a big fuss, and I just let him.

216
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,280
So you just walked out and came on your own?

217
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Brothers, always think they can tell you what to do.

218
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Well, I just ignored him. Did you tell your parents where you were?

219
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Ah, no.

220
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Did you put him up to this stinky? It's just a sort of thing you do.

221
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
No, I did not.

222
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
That's true, Snark Maiden.

223
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Well, I don't know how you did it stinky, but I know you,

224
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,280
and I know you're to blame, and I don't think I won't find out.

225
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,280
That's not fair, Snark Maiden. It was nothing to do with me at all.

226
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
Oh, you're right, Snark Maiden.

227
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,280
He didn't want to show me the way, but I made him.

228
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
I'm taking you home.

229
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Oh, but Snark Maiden, look.

230
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
No, buts, you're sick, and you should be in bed,

231
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
and your parents must be very worried.

232
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Ah, look.

233
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Moomin!

234
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Oh, it's Papa. It isn't that Snark behind him.

235
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,280
Oh, yes, it is.

236
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,280
Oh, oh, it's time I wasn't here.

237
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,280
I'm glad you hadn't gone too far, Moomin.

238
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
I might never have found you.

239
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
I'm very sorry, Papa.

240
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Ah!

241
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
I have a feeling you're behind this stinky.

242
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
Come on quickly, I'll win it.

243
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

244
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,280
It was Moomin's idea. I swear it was.

245
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,280
It was, Papa. I wanted to find Snark Maiden.

246
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Are you all right, Moomin?

247
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
Snark Maiden!

248
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Ah, here we go again.

249
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Snark Maiden, what are you doing here?

250
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
I thought I told you not to go on this silly jump.

251
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,280
Well, I didn't say I wouldn't. Did I?

252
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Listen to me, Snark.

253
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Ah, you're looking guilty, stinky.

254
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
How did you persuade her to disobey me?

255
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,280
See, I told you.

256
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
You stay nice and warm in bed, and I'll mix them

257
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,280
of grandma's potion with honey for you.

258
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
You'll have to be better soon,

259
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,280
because I have a feeling snuffkins on his way.

260
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,280
My wish snuffkin would hurry up,

261
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
then we could all get back to normal at last.

262
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
My sentiment's exactly.

263
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,280
So where is Snuffkin?

264
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Well, he's on his way back to Moomin Valley.

265
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,280
But he's had a very long walk,

266
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,280
and is getting very tired now.

267
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Poor Snuffkin, he's had a terrible cold as well,

268
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,280
and is feeling rather weak.

269
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Hello, I know you don't I?

270
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Oh?

271
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Yes, you're snuffkin.

272
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Oh!

273
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Isn't that water still a little cold for that?

274
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,280
You'd better come by the fire and keep warm,

275
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,280
or you'll catch cold.

276
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,280
This is nice!

277
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,280
Just think, I'll be the one that's set by Snuffkin's fire,

278
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,280
and he told me to keep warm and not catch cold.

279
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Hmm, that's no big thing, little fella.

280
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
It's a pretty chilly night out here.

281
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Oh, it is!

282
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,280
I've heard so many stories about you from everybody,

283
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
and each year I try to watch as you go past,

284
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,280
but I've never been brave enough to talk to you before.

285
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Stories from everybody.

286
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
I don't know if I like that.

287
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,280
In fact, I'm sure I don't.

288
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,280
What's your name, little fella?

289
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Oh, well, I haven't got one.

290
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,280
I'm so small that nobody's ever asked me before.

291
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,280
I've always wanted to have a name, you know?

292
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
And it was you who asked me,

293
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
and I've actually met you and sat next to it.

294
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,280
You're countifying!

295
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
Oh, it's so wonderful!

296
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,280
You don't know how happy it makes me meeting you like this!

297
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Aw, come on, you do go on a bit old, fella.

298
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
You just get warm now.

299
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Do you think, Snuffkin?

300
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
Oh, I don't know whether I should ask you.

301
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
I don't want to offend you.

302
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Oh, well, why not?

303
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Yes, I will.

304
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
Perhaps you'd be kind enough to it.

305
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,280
I mean, would it be too much trouble for you

306
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,280
to think of a name for me?

307
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
There.

308
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,280
I've said it now.

309
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
Well, choosing a name is important.

310
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
I'd have to think carefully about that.

311
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
But it will be easy for you.

312
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Now, everything!

313
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
Now, listen to me.

314
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,280
You can't look up to people too much if you want to be yourself.

315
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
It's not right.

316
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
But Snuffkin, you're so clever.

317
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,280
You can do anything, anything at all.

318
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
I know you can.

319
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,280
I've always wanted to be free like you to do whatever I feel.

320
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm talking too much.

321
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
I want to listen to you too.

322
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
All about your travels for a start.

323
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I know you're on your way to the Moon Valley to see all your friends.

324
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,280
The hedgehog told me the Moon stayed out for most of the winter.

325
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
Just waiting for you to come back.

326
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
Now, isn't that wonderful?

327
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,280
What?

328
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
I'd love to have someone that missed me so much

329
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
they were miserable until I came back.

330
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,280
You don't know how lucky you are that you're so special.

331
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Well, perhaps I'm not going there.

332
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,280
I might have somewhere else to visit instead.

333
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Oh, moment, I'll be very sad if you don't go back.

334
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Yes, but you've got to have time to be on your own as well.

335
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Of course you have, and I've taken up too much of yours now.

336
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Wait, I think I'll be off.

337
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Okay, thanks.

338
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Goodbye, Snuffkin.

339
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Good night, little fella.

340
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Hey, wait a minute.

341
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
What about your name?

342
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
You remembered.

343
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Well, what do you think of TD Wu, my friend?

344
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,280
Yes, TD Wu.

345
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,280
It's nice and happy to start with, and then a little sadness.

346
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
TD Wu.

347
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
дом?

348
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
T-T Wu.

349
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
T-T Wu.

350
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
T-T Wu.

351
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
T-T Wu.

352
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,280
T-T Wu.

353
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
T-T Wu.

354
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,280
T-T Wu, T-T Wu.

355
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,280
T-T Wu.

356
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
T-T Wu.

357
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,280
T-T Wu.

358
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,280
T-T Wu.

359
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
T-T Wu.

360
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
T-T Wu.

361
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Oh, that's great! It's a wonderful name, Titi Woo!

362
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,280
Titi Woo, I'm glad you like it. It's the first time I've ever given anyone a name.

363
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:29,280
Yeah! I think I'll be able to house and then I can put up a real name plate that says Titi Woo!

364
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Ah, good idea, Titi Woo. About what I said before.

365
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Huh?

366
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,280
You know, not going back to Moomin Valley? Well, I am. I've missed Moomin and all my friends.

367
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:47,280
Oh, I didn't take that seriously. You just got upset at something I said. I'm afraid that happens a lot. I guess I talked too much.

368
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Maybe you do.

369
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Oh, I'll be going back to Moomin Valley a bit behind schedule. And this year's spring came along early too.

370
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,280
But I suppose it's better late than never, as they say.

371
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Moomin will be happy. Say hello to everyone from Titi Woo!

372
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,280
I will. And I'll tell them how it came about.

373
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,280
That's where you keep your harmonica, isn't it, Snuffkin? It's really famous, you know?

374
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
I didn't realize that.

375
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Do you know? I've never ever heard any music.

376
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,280
Really? What would you like me to play?

377
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,280
Anything. Oh, I know. What about Moomin's favorite?

378
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,280
Oh, that's Snuffkin!

379
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
Oh, God!

380
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
Don't move!

381
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Snuffkin!

382
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Snuffkin!

383
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,280
Now at last, spring really has come to Moomin Valley.

384
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:11,280
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.

385
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:18,280
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

386
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,280
They're always happy and always at play.

387
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:29,280
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

388
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:39,280
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.

389
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

390
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,280
They're always happy and always at play.

391
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:58,280
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

392
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,280
The Moomin's.

393
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:08,280
The Moomin's.
