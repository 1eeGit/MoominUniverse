15
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,520
got to see that one again but who will guard my prisoners I wonder I'm a good

16
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,720
idea officer you could take the three of us with you to the theater to see the play

17
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,560
good idea we love the theater so we won't try to run away officer I promise

18
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,880
not possible I won't let you out of this jail until you write out it's forbidden to burn

19
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:40,600
signs five thousand times each that's the punishment for vandals well in that case you won't be

20
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:48,680
able to see the play who cares although yes I must see it I must go so you'll take us with you

21
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,520
no you stay right here well then you can't go either officer right you're upsetting me

22
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:02,680
no no this isn't good enough it's not true drama please woman papa I don't want to be just a

23
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,680
lion's ugly behind but sniff I did give you another part I don't want to be a baby either

24
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,560
and she said you wanted parts with that lines it could you do the dusting a bit later Emma please

25
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,480
he's script should be ready now we have to start practicing for the opening night tomorrow morning

26
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,560
don't worry Emma it's coming along I'm only half done I shall never get ready in time

27
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,120
moment mama you're right to worry for the curtain will rise tomorrow no matter what

28
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,720
women papa will remember to give Emma lots and lots of lines she's really looking forward to

29
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:45,000
her first performance all right now leave me I must be left alone to concentrate the writer needs

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,840
peace and quiet there are some things I don't like about this script I'll discuss it with you

31
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,680
after the performance sniff after if it's a story about lost children why do you have to have a

32
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,560
stupid lion I'm too good an actor to be cast as a lion keep them out of my hair when indeed he's

33
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,640
giving me a headache you come with me sniff we'll practice our parts this could be a wonderful

34
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:16,040
play if you'd only skip the lions behind I've heard enough about this behind remember we have

35
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,040
a lion's head too dying to show his acting skills on the stage this is my play and I refuse

36
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:32,120
to write out the lion's part I refuse here's the key I want you to keep a keen eye on them until

37
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:38,760
I come back do you understand me cousin are they very dangerous yes they certainly are they bite

38
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,600
if you let them out okay we certainly wouldn't bite anyone obviously I've had enough of your

39
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,440
lies don't listen to my dear cousin they do well then now I'm up to the theater to see the play

40
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:59,320
take good care of them while I'm gone

41
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:15,160
excuse me you seem to be a very good knitter oh thank you nobody ever said that to me before I enjoy it

42
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,800
what are you making I'm not sure I don't really know nothing in particular it's just that

43
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,680
knitting is so reassuring somehow nothing bad can happen while you knit can it trouble is I

44
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:36,200
always seem to forget to decide what to make before I start but it feels nice and warm and I

45
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:44,280
love the color couldn't you make socks it's a very nice sock color socks yes it's very very

46
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:53,960
cold in here oh yes that's a very good idea listen if I knitted each one of you a pair of warm

47
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:01,480
socks would you really put them on of course that will be nice I'm almost freezing to death in here

48
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:08,920
it's so very very cold is it really that cold yes my teeth are chattering so I could hardly talk

49
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:17,960
honestly oh dear oh dear what should I do maybe some steaming hot black currant juice would help

50
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,400
to warm us up a little possibly although it might already be too late

51
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,120
my cousin would be very angry with me if he knew but I think but you think why I think I'll

52
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:57,960
let you out so that we can all be nice and warm indoors really don't cry now baby there's a good

53
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:13,000
boy don't cry honey that's enough baby oh woman mama you need to show much more immersion it's

54
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,320
right to be more motherly and more loving listen dear this is a very happy baby how am I doing

55
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,280
woman papa you're just perfect for the part sniffing your performance was excellent

56
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:38,280
maybe I should add a part with some lines in it

57
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:49,160
look at these I think they might be ready by now I hope they're tasty they don't always come out

58
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:56,440
very well you're so kind we've had so much already but they smell really delicious they sure do

59
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,440
thank you so much now I feel warm again how about some more black currant juice or maybe one of these

60
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,720
freshly baked cookies it's very kind of you but no thank you I couldn't eat another thing I'm so

61
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:18,440
full up me too oh dear the party is over then I'm afraid so it's really sad but I have to

62
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,480
lock you up again but at least I know you're warm in there we're really sorry too but you don't

63
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:29,880
need to worry because actually we're not going back to jail oh aren't you we've got other plans

64
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,120
we're going to the theater to see my parents play and I suppose I should say hello to my Aunt Emma

65
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:43,800
who works there oh what shall I do my cousin will be very cross with me but you see we're innocent

66
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:51,400
we didn't do anything wrong you didn't I swear it do I look like someone who pulls up signs in a

67
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,680
park we just burned some flats and left by the flood but your cousin wouldn't believe it he

68
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:03,560
jumped to conclusions wrongful arrest that's all it was oh dear why didn't you tell me that it

69
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:10,120
once oh people shouldn't go to jail when they haven't done anything wrong so we can go to the

70
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,560
theaters that okay of course better leave right away my cousin will be very disappointed but I

71
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,120
guess I can't be helped wait for me I think I'd better come along and explain to that cousin of

72
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,360
mind that his three prisoners are innocent of the charge against them

73
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:37,080
all right all right bring it in that's right momma stop there okay sniff moment mama what have

74
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:43,080
you got there a baby's crib I want to use this in the play if that's all right with you

75
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:49,720
moment papa moment papa I just read your script and I think you have a big problem who is going

76
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,080
to pay the parts of moment and snorkemaiden in this play of yours I don't know yet we don't have

77
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,000
any more children and sniff can't take the part are you utterly mad we only have a few hours

78
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,880
before the curtain goes up and you don't even have actors for all the part what kind of director is

79
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,840
that maybe one of us could stand behind something and sort of read their line we did kill us

80
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:20,440
idea let's hope the credits are brown hold on tight all of you

81
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,160
