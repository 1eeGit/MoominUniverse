exciting empty house I've ever seen why do you say that what do you mean exciting do you mean
interesting or do you mean scary little my interesting and scary looks Norgmaiden look around
oh what a lot of mirrors this house must have been full of women who loved glow or maybe just one
woman snork maiden who had as many faces as there are mirrors in this room I don't like that look
every mirror has a chair in front of it place just like so this house was full of ladies and each
had her own little mirror thank goodness we brought some plates with us
look what I found bread naples how nice if now we can have a real breakfast but where is everybody
well I don't know somewhere around
whoever lived here must have had a lot of strange hobbies you're so right
hey who said that wow look at that cog wheel the snork would love that I wonder what
woman will say about this little mind I'm sure he'll say you look better without anything
one look at you and he won't even notice anything else well if he has any sense he will fall
for me like a ton of bricks you want about breakfast woman mama we'll have breakfast as soon as we
are all here I wonder where they can all be you know it's very bad for me to go hungry I always feel
unwell if I don't eat all right sniff you go ahead but mind you don't eat all the apples leave

in a football my novel trick to play on people making false fruit I'm very upset

owner of this house no oh indeed I am not most certainly not you are greatly mistaken this
is no house you fool this is a theater as the editor yes this is a stage where the heroine
receives a standing ovation at the end of the last act and the bread and the apples are props

people kings or murderers oh and you are one of these actors actress you understand less than
nothing see this broom here this is my only prop I sweep the dust in this theater oh really I have
wielded this broom for nearly 20 years would nobody to help me 20 years I have cleaned this theater

it reminds me of NASA, but it reminds me of, it reminds me of...
but it reminds me of a brainwarming scene in the sensual house
and it reminds me of a brain of a brainwarming scene in the sensual house
and it reminds me of a brainwarming scene
and it reminds me of a brain nerd

And it reminds you of a Mary projections
I remember this
when I first saw...
a cat who threw her shoes
under my shoes
and it reminds me of a brain [(Shortcutting their shoes by himself-)]
and it reminds me of...?
I remember Gabriel Peng and his brother
when I first saw him

That looks safe. We could easily spend the night here.
We'd better tie the theatre to the tree so it won't drift away if that's all right with Emma.
Emma, is it all right to tie the theatre to the tree?
Do what you want, as long as you don't damage the theatre to here.
All right.
Don't whistle you idiot. Don't ever whistle in a theatre.
That's the worst luck possible. How dare you?
Oh.
This is great snork maiden. We can look at the moon.
And the flowers, they smell so good.
What's the matter?
I hope that snorks all right?
Don't you worry. He was standing guard over a flying ship after all.
All you have to do is get on board and fly away.
What's going on here?
Huh?
No, they're trying to destroy the pamphor's box. I've never seen anything like it.
These people are bunch of vandals.
Meanwhile, movement and snork maiden are fast asleep, blissfully unaware of what was happening.
But whatever they do, stranded on the treetop.
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
They're always happy and goes at play.
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.
The movements. The movements.
