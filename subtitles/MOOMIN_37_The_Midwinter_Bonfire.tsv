286640	292080	hibernating he wanted to finish his blueprints before spring if he could I hope you'll succeed
292080	300400	this time when you go out outside just to see what the snow looks like oh no I don't really feel
300400	307600	like it it's nice and warm here why don't we sleep does spring like the others spring is still a
307840	314400	long way off guess you're right it is nice and warm in here

350800	357040	everybody said that last winter too he moment yeah I have a funny feeling someone is watching us
357040	362960	and I don't like it one little bit moment poppacate explain it I'm sure of course someone's watching
363040	368640	what but who and how do you know to take you told me all about it last winter snort maiden she
368640	374000	doesn't hibernate you know she lives in our bathhouse and watches over us in the winter she said
374000	380880	that many things are too shy to show themselves oh have you seen them yourself short of except they
380880	389040	were invisible of course like under the sink or in the clock maybe in the empty fireplace and other
389120	395760	dark corners of the room I can feel it did you actually look anywhere for them oh no they'd be
395760	400960	very upset it's better not to let them know we know where they are I wonder what these things look
400960	406160	like some of them look very much like us two tiki said old ancestors of ours from way back she
406160	412160	thinks some of them look like as she said well I've never seen them for myself I wonder if there is
412160	423600	good looking as we are wouldn't it be a good idea to stay up and wait for the sunrise a great idea
429600	435280	now don't say anything to scare them but this is one of the movement's ancestors from way back
435920	444880	is it morning already are you sure I think so there are no clouds so why can't we see the sun I guess

553600	561600	hey you up there are you making fun of me too
561600	575600	oh I can't climb down there of course you can even if you fall you can't hurt yourself on this soft snow
575600	581520	don't shake the ladder Moomin this is scary slowly does it take it easy as
581520	585520	you can don't look down maybe going out wasn't such a good idea after all
585520	589520	we can always change our mind to go back to sleep you know
589520	593520	see you've made it it's very cold out here Moomin but I'd rather like it
597520	603520	this is the roof over the front door isn't it yes and everything will be snowed up now to spring oh no
603520	605520	what's happened to our firewood
605920	615840	what's the matter there's not much wood left in here someone else must be burning it
615840	623760	yes but who and for what I wonder I can feel it we're not alone in this forest I'm sure
623760	628720	someone's watching us all those winter creatures no I don't think it's them
628720	633840	the grog
638320	641680	goodness me look how big she gets in the winter time
641680	646480	Moomin I'm scared it'll be all right
647360	649600	grog stop right there
652240	656720	don't come any closer if you please you're much much too cold for us you see
657120	664800	you could freeze a stiff you know oh is it possible that you get lonely all by yourself
667040	671920	I don't think there's anything we can do to help you know not without fur coats and earmuffs and
671920	674480	more gloves anyway we must go
691440	695600	someone's been stealing our firewood I wonder what they're doing with it
695600	703280	something bad there's no doubt about that must have been several people did this
718160	723520	we had a lot of fun here in the summer remember well the she is still here
723520	733520	round of the ice I hope too ticky too ticky there's no one here are you sure look for yourself
736800	742640	I know they're invisible but I'm a shrewmice in here hard to tell with things you can't see
743760	750880	oh what is it it felt like something scampering on my back that's all right it must be one of the shrewmice
753920	769440	oh my god my goodness I've never seen anything quite like this before hi it's good to see you
770160	776880	you're right she's fishing hi to ticky hello to ticky so this winter's not meant to walk up to huh
777520	783600	uh uh I walk her up by mistake you know that spring is still a long way off don't you I thought it
783600	789520	might be seeing there's no sun at all but the sun is going to come back tomorrow woman tomorrow
790160	795680	snorkemaiden was so worried about the sun not showing the sun will rise tomorrow woman but it'll
795680	802720	go down very soon to ticky you know I think there must be records in moving valley records in winter
802720	809440	there's an enormous pile of firewood up on the hillside I know it took a long time to collect that
809440	816080	wood but some of it belongs to us that doesn't really surprise me though woman I'm afraid the
816080	821920	winner creatures unfair careful about ownership they need a lot so if they see it they take it it's
821920	829280	for their big winner bonfire a bonfire yes and now your firewood can take part in the big celebration
829360	835440	they light it every winter to make sure the sun comes back you know oh you mean otherwise the sun
835440	842160	wouldn't come back to ticky well since they always light it on this day you don't really know do you
842160	848000	tonight you might see the winner creatures okay we come along as well to ticky yes you can if you
848000	852960	sit quietly and don't scare them in any way wonderful you're coming along too aren't you
852960	859520	it of course stop happy someone shouting for help who could it be
860160	866960	go away get away from me I didn't do it on purpose I didn't mean any harm if you don't leave
866960	872720	me alone grandma will turn you into a towed oh it's so cold go away please
872720	874720	oh
880640	884240	grow leave her alone what are you doing Grog
887360	894400	movement Alicia now listen Grog why can't you be nice to her Alicia's one of my friends she was
894400	899440	just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis I nearly bumped into her but
899440	904960	I didn't touch her that's all right Alicia tell me Grog what's gotten into you why you so nasty
904960	911040	to such a sweet little girl it isn't like you at all I must have startled her I guess and I did
911040	917040	apologize and all but it made no difference this is really very odd then I asked if she had seen
917040	923280	you and that's when she started to get mad at me but she doesn't even know me it's a mystery
923360	925280	whatever's the matter with you Grog
939920	946880	oh it was so scared I'm so glad you've come to see us so am I moment somehow I felt certain you
946880	952560	hadn't gone into hibernation yet but what did your grandmother say nothing because I
952560	958000	didn't tell her I was coming thank you for chasing off that terrible monster the Grog hasn't
958000	964640	actually ever attacked anyone well maybe she doesn't like the look of Alicia snork maiden oh it's
964640	970960	really a mystery to me why the Grog was here at all she was here looking for a moment no doubt was
970960	976560	she he suddenly become very popular you don't mean
991520	998000	what's the matter with you I think the Grog may have fallen in love with you movement what oh you
998000	1004400	can't mean that please tell me you're not serious it's out of the question it's a ridiculous idea don't
1004400	1006400	be so silly
1007360	1013360	oh
1024080	1030480	where's all that drumming noise coming from from the invisible shroom ice how long before everybody
1031440	1036960	oh they're here already movement all around us they are where I can't see them
1037760	1044240	are they really invisible I can't see them either but I can feel their presence all around me
1044800	1050320	but she's been studying witchcraft hasn't she I'm sure you and movement will be able to feel
1050320	1052320	their presence quite soon
1080320	1090320	oh
1097120	1103120	I can see some of them look they're over there
1110320	1112320	I see them too you guys
1118320	1123360	do you think you tell me why can't we see all of them well we can never see them all
1123360	1128000	I don't understand how did you know earlier on the shroom ice were playing the drums
1128000	1131360	I just know because they sometimes play them in the batch house as well
1131360	1136560	what a wonderful celebration isn't it lucky I came over here if I had not
1136560	1138560	had missed a most memorable evening
1153520	1157520	what's going on here the grog what
1157520	1168960	what's she doing she must be looking for movement again I guess no I think she just wants to warm
1168960	1171920	this up by the fire
1185920	1189920	what's she doing
1189920	1202880	oh that's the end of the midwinter bonfire pull grog she freezes everything she touches
1202880	1207760	whatever she sits on even the hottest bonfire turns freezing cold in a matter of seconds
1209280	1212000	well at least she's managed to save some of our wood
1220880	1227120	oh hold on tight now snorke made in and be careful I can't wait to get into bed
1227920	1233520	I wanted to stay up until the sun came up again but I don't know if I could keep awake till then
1234400	1244560	so long till spring man room man goodbye and take care Alicia I will move in the moon will light my way back
1249920	1268800	this time the movements of God too far something must be done I'll teach them a lesson they'll never forget
1271280	1279120	they won't get the better at me now what does the witch mean by teach them a lesson
1279120	1285120	that sounds very ominous let's hope at least that she lets them sleep till next spring
1292880	1299040	they love the laughter and they love the living the movements
1299840	1306240	we're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements
1307520	1314880	they're always happy and goes at play the moments are having fun day after day the
1315040	1321360	moments the moments, the moments
1321360	1328360	The Moons
