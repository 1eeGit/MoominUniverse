0	21000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.
29000	36000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land.
36000	46000	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,
46000	59000	there was the movements, there was the movements, there was the movements, there was the movements,
59000	80720	When the Hennian first told Mumen about the golden fish, Mumen thought to himself that
80720	82720	But it must look something like this.
89720	93720	My grandpa told me that his mother had actually seen it.
93720	95720	So you never saw it yourself, Mr. Hemion?
95720	97720	No, I'm a batonist.
97720	101720	It comes to the surface only under very special conditions.
101720	103720	It's very rarely seen.
103720	104720	Conditions?
104720	105720	Yes.
105720	108720	First of all, it must be right between summer and autumn.
109720	110720	But that's now.
110720	111720	Yes.
111720	114720	It has to be in the afternoon sunshine after heavy rain.
114720	116720	Yes, that does narrow it down.
116720	118720	And there must be no wind.
118720	120720	Grandpa said not even a ripple on the water.
120720	122720	Oh dear.
122720	127720	And there are some other conditions that he really didn't know about anyway to see it.
127720	129720	You must be extremely lucky.
131720	132720	Hmm.
132720	134720	Just getting to the lake itself isn't too easy.
134720	136720	It's way beyond lonely mountains.
139720	143720	Going over lonely mountains and back would take at least two days.
143720	146720	Not really, because I know a shortcut movement.
146720	148720	I could take you there and back in one day.
148720	150720	Oh, could you do that?
150720	151720	Yes.
151720	153720	Have you already been there, Snuffkin?
153720	155720	Just once.
155720	157720	Oh, will you show me the way?
157720	158720	You really want to go?
158720	159720	Yes.
159720	163720	I must see that golden fish with my own eyes and maybe capture it.
163720	165720	It won't be easy to capture.
165720	167720	Why not?
167720	170720	From what I've heard, the golden fish is far too clever to get caught.
170720	173720	I know, but it would be so much fun.
173720	174720	You going alone?
174720	177720	Well, Snorkmaiden said she wanted to come along.
177720	179720	She gets these ideas, you know.
179720	180720	Just Snorkmaiden?
180720	181720	Uh, maybe a little my.
181720	183720	What about Sniff?
183720	185720	I think he wants to come along, too.
185720	187720	What about you?
187720	190720	In that case, we'd better go across the mountains.
190720	192720	Why is that? Why can't we take the shortcut?
192720	195720	The path is rather steep and dangerous, you know, Moomin.
196720	198720	Especially in the forest of witches.
198720	199720	Hide the witches?
199720	200720	Not now, maybe.
200720	202720	Oh, so it's safe then.
202720	206720	But it's a very deep forest dark and scary even in daytime.
209720	211720	That's okay, we'll take the shortcut.
211720	212720	Hmm.
225720	227720	Oh, dear.
227720	229720	Come on.
251720	253720	Good morning, Snuffkin.
256720	257720	Oh.
266720	268720	Sorry, Snuffkin, guess I overslept.
268720	271720	Snorkmaiden a little my, aren't here yet.
271720	273720	You're very early.
273720	275720	Hmm, I dreamt I caught the golden fish,
275720	277720	and then, of course, I couldn't go back to sleep.
277720	279720	Well, let's go.
279720	281720	Shouldn't we wait for Snorkmaiden a little my?
281720	284720	Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?
284720	288720	And anyway, didn't we decide that we wouldn't wait for anybody?
288720	290720	So it might be better this way.
290720	292720	What's better this way, Moomin?
292720	294720	Oh, little my.
294720	296720	Why don't you stay here?
296720	298720	This will be a very tough expedition.
298720	300720	I'm tougher than you.
300720	302720	Wait for me.
308720	310720	Hey, walk any faster, Snuffkin.
310720	312720	I'm still so sleepy.
313720	316720	Why did we have to leave so early, Moomin?
316720	318720	To get there back in a day, Snorkmaiden.
318720	320720	But we aren't taking the shortcut, are we?
320720	323720	Yes, but it still might get dark before we're back.
323720	325720	I won't be able to walk back this fast, you know,
325720	328720	because my bucket will be full of water for the golden fish.
328720	331720	Well, don't be disappointed if you don't catch it.
331720	333720	But that's my whole reason for going.
333720	336720	But you heard what the Himmelin said, Snuff?
336720	339720	We'll be extremely lucky to even catch sight of the golden fish.
339720	342720	I heard him and now's exactly the right time.
342720	345720	Maybe the others made too much noise.
345720	347720	We'll just have to wait and see.
347720	349720	Don't you worry, I'll catch him all right.
359720	362720	Where are they going sorely in the morning?
366720	368720	How far is the forest of witches?
368720	370720	I'd say about two hours.
370720	375720	And can you also tell us how long from one end of the forest to the other, Snuffkin?
375720	377720	About the same.
380720	382720	Are there really such things as witches?
382720	383720	No.
383720	385720	Baby, because I'm not a bit scared of them.
385720	386720	Aren't you?
386720	388720	Not the least little bit.
388720	389720	There used to be some, though.
389720	390720	What witches?
390720	391720	Well, of course, sniff.
391720	394720	What helps do you think that they call it the forest of witches, huh?
394720	397720	And you're absolutely sure that there are no witches now.
398720	400720	I haven't heard of any coming back.
400720	401720	Mm-hmm.
401720	405720	So you're not absolutely sure that there are no witches?
412720	415720	Where's Moominer still in bed?
415720	417720	He was off before you woke up, Papa.
417720	418720	Mm.
418720	421720	Oh, the golden fish.
421720	423720	Good morning, dear.
423720	425720	I wanted to go with him.
425720	428720	Are you writing your memoirs you're far too busy?
428720	429720	Mm-hmm.
429720	432720	That's very true with the thought of a fish that no one has seen.
432720	435720	That might have been a whole chapter.
435720	437720	Do you think they'll catch it?
437720	440720	No, I doubt it very much. It's highly unlikely.
440720	442720	In that case, you should have gone with them.
442720	445720	No, I do know a thing or two about fishing.
445720	448720	Snuffkin does, too, but he's still so young.
448720	451720	Oh, don't worry. I'm sure Snuffkin will manage.
452720	455720	Oh, this is a spooky forest.
455720	457720	Maybe the witch is every time.
457720	458720	Stop it, little lion.
458720	461720	Listen, everybody. Don't stray away from me.
461720	463720	Promise you might get lost.
482720	483720	Oh!
487720	489720	Oh!
489720	491720	Oh!
491720	494720	It's so dark in here.
494720	499720	Sure is, and so thick the sun can't get through.
499720	502720	That's because of those clouds.
505720	508720	I can hear the wind, but we need calm.
508720	510720	Yes, but we also need heavy rain.
510720	513720	You're right. That's what the Hemiellin said.
513720	515720	It sure looks like rain.
515720	517720	Not only looks like...
519720	521720	Oh, it's raining.
537720	538720	Here.
538720	540720	Thank you.
543720	546720	I gotta say, this rainstorm was very sudden.
546720	548720	Don't worry. It won't last that long.
548720	549720	How do you know that?
549720	551720	Vagabons do.
551720	553720	This rain isn't that heavy.
553720	555720	No, it's not bad, but we better hurryer.
555720	559720	We won't get to lake till noon, and that'll be too late.
559720	562720	I don't think we'll get very wet down here, Mum.
562720	563720	And so why don't we move on?
563720	565720	You're so excited.
565720	567720	What should we do with Snuffkin?
568720	570720	Well, we could move on, couldn't we?
586720	590720	We really aren't getting too wet.
590720	592720	We better find some shelter quickly.
592720	594720	But where can we shelter?
594720	596720	There's nothing in this wood-exec tree.
596720	599720	I'm gonna eat tree then, I guess.
599720	601720	Yeah!
601720	603720	What is it, Snuffkin?
603720	605720	There's a house over there.
611720	613720	It's fallen to rock and ruin.
613720	616720	Well, at least it'll keep the rain off.
627720	636720	Hello there, anyone home?
636720	639720	There's nobody here.
649720	652720	No one's lived here for a long time.
653720	657720	I wonder who could have been who lived here all alone.
664720	668720	I know who it was, and so do we all, don't we?
668720	670720	Surely you don't mean.
670720	672720	The winches, of course.
674720	681720	Look around for dried spices, magic herbs, broomsticks, and a black cat, an iron pot.
682720	683720	Appile.
683720	684720	But no broom.
684720	686720	No, the witch rode away on it.
691720	693720	There's someone here.
693720	694720	Who is it?
701720	703720	Let's get out of here.
703720	705720	Came from over there.
711720	713720	No, that's okay, Snuffkin.
713720	715720	We gotta get out of this place.
725720	727720	I can't move, Snuffkin.
727720	728720	Stinky?
733720	734720	Pretty good.
734720	736720	I bet you were really scared.
736720	738720	I wasn't a bit scared, Stinky.
738720	741720	It's very rude of snip to faint when he hears my voice.
741720	743720	Where are you off to anyway?
746720	748720	Oh, come on, tell me.
748720	749720	Can't seem to take a joke.
749720	751720	Come on, wait for me.
766720	767720	That way.
768720	769720	Okay.
770720	771720	Come on.
798720	799720	This is it, isn't it?
799720	800720	Yes it is.
800720	801720	Where's the golden fish?
801720	802720	I really don't know.
802720	804720	I've never seen it either.
804720	807720	With rain, sunshine, and calm, I'm sure the fish will come.
807720	808720	The golden fish?
808720	809720	Help me catch it.
809720	811720	I just gotta have that golden fish.
827720	828720	Oh.
837720	839720	It's deep down in here somewhere.
845720	847720	I can't see any fish anywhere.
847720	850720	Maybe it was Hemiellin's idea of a very funny joke.
852720	854720	The Hemiellin doesn't joke.
854720	855720	Let's sit down and wait.
855720	858720	I'm sure the golden fish will appear for us.
858720	859720	I don't believe it.
859720	863720	Do you mean to say you came all this way here just to see some stupid old fish?
863720	864720	I came to catch it.
864720	866720	Well, that's even more stupid.
866720	868720	Hey, stop making those ripples.
873720	876720	So they really got excited and walked all the way, you say?
876720	878720	Oh, to be young again.
878720	882720	Well, I would have gone with them if I hadn't over slept.
882720	885720	I didn't know that you were that young woman, Papa.
885720	888720	Oh, I'm not exactly old, you know.
888720	891720	Pretty interesting to see a fish that hardly anyone's ever seen.
893720	897720	Snip said that he would catch this golden fish if it's the last thing he did.
897720	898720	Oh, how?
898720	902720	Well, he had a net and a very large bucket to carry at home, then.
904720	905720	That's a good one.
906720	907720	What do you mean?
908720	911720	I guess I must have forgotten to tell you all the details.
911720	914720	There's so much you don't know about this fish.
921720	923720	Can't see it from up here.
924720	927720	Oh, the hemulin was certainly right.
927720	931720	Hardly anyone has seen this golden fish and we're not going to see it either.
931720	933720	Maybe somebody ate him years ago.
933720	935720	Stinky, be quiet, please.
938720	939720	Did you see it?
939720	940720	Where did you see it?
942720	943720	Huh?
943720	947720	I saw a fish jump, but I couldn't tell if it was golden.
947720	949720	It was much too far away.
949720	952720	With the sun over there, we'd just see the outlines, Nork Maiden.
952720	954720	Yes, we couldn't really see the color.
954720	956720	Look, everybody, look!
956720	958720	I can see a raft over there!
959720	962720	Hey, let's take it and go out to the middle of the lake.
962720	965720	But it's much too small for all of us.
965720	967720	Don't worry, Snip. This won't sink.
972720	973720	I'm staying.
973720	977720	You do what you like, but you'll never catch any fish if you're afraid of water.
979720	982720	Stinky, you can help me. It's gold, you know.
982720	986720	We can sell it for a lot of money and then we'll both be very wealthy.
998720	1000720	I think it was somewhere around here, wasn't it?
1000720	1003720	We're less, I suppose, hard to say.
1003720	1005720	Well, I can't see anything.
1005720	1006720	I can't see!
1006720	1009720	There's certainly no sign of it now.
1010720	1013720	Well, we'll just have to sit and wait here.
1014720	1015720	We have no choice.
1015720	1019720	And I'm not going home until I've seen it. I'm happy to wait all day.
1019720	1022720	You won't find it by looking up at the sky.
1022720	1027720	You know what? Fish like it in places where there are lots of wings.
1028720	1030720	Oh, the rafts in the middle of the lake.
1030720	1034720	And they just want to see the fish, but you wait, I'm going to catch it.
1034720	1039720	Maybe somebody's already caught it and you can get it in a tin.
1044720	1045720	What did you see?
1045720	1047720	Over there, something shiny jumping!
1047720	1051720	What did you see? Ditorger, now keep quiet.
1058720	1060720	I hate fishing.
1060720	1064720	Guess we better think about getting back otherwise we'll never get home before nightfall.
1064720	1067720	I don't want to get lost on a raft in the dark on this lonely lake.
1067720	1070720	Perhaps we were expecting too much.
1070720	1074720	Maybe your right's not made in, but I really thought we'd see it.
1074720	1077720	This is the most disappointing day of my life.
1077720	1079720	We can come back.
1079720	1081720	Yes.
1100720	1102720	It's not gonna stop.
1102720	1104720	Did you see a moment?
1132720	1134720	It's gigantic.
1162720	1164720	Oh!
1183720	1185720	We've seen!
1185720	1187720	Oh, that was right!
1187720	1189720	I really saw it!
1190720	1192720	I saw it!
1213720	1215720	I did it, I caught it!
1215720	1216720	God, what?
1216720	1218720	Why the golden fish, of course?
1218720	1219720	What?
1219720	1222720	I've got the golden fish in here if you want to have a look at it.
1222720	1224720	See, it's in this bucket.
1226720	1229720	You don't really believe that is the golden fish.
1232720	1234720	It's just another stupid fish.
1234720	1237720	I can swear that it really was golden when I caught it.
1237720	1240720	It must have been the sun making it land in the water.
1240720	1243720	It was you said it was the golden fish.
1243720	1244720	Why don't you let it go?
1244720	1247720	You know it's not the right one and he hates it in that bucket.
1255720	1256720	There he goes.
1256720	1258720	It looks so happy now.
1258720	1261720	It really was golden when I first saw it.
