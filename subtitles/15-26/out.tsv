0	2500	Oh, what exactly is it you're observing?
2500	5500	I'm sure I saw a beautiful crayfish in there.
5500	9500	Crayfish? Excuse me, young man, but that is zoology.
9500	12500	Quite the most uninteresting field.
12500	14500	There it is.
42500	49500	Oh! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
73500	79500	I got him! I got him!
79500	84500	I got him!
96500	98500	A dragon?
102500	109500	Papa!
109500	113500	Oh, what have you got there?
113500	115500	Oh, oh, nothing, Papa.
115500	118500	Everything's so fresh after the rain.
118500	119500	Oh, woman.
119500	123500	Yes, it is.
123500	127000	I've got to show this to Snuffkin before anybody else sees it.
147000	148500	Boom, moment!
148500	150500	What have you got there, Moomin?
150500	153000	Oh, nothing. Nothing at all, little lie.
153000	156000	Oh, yes, you have, I saw it. Don't lie to me.
156000	158000	It's just one of Mom's old jars.
158000	160000	Liar, liar, I know there's something.
160000	162000	I don't think there's nothing.
165000	168000	Then why are you hiding it?
168000	172000	Oh, right, little mice. See me, it's not fair.
173000	174000	Dragon.
174000	176000	Ah, yeah, I was right.
176000	178000	They must be a baby dragon.
178000	182000	Probably the very last one on Earth and washed up by the rain.
182000	184000	A dragon of my own.
184000	187000	Well, that's wonderful.
187000	190000	Oh, I hope I didn't frighten you.
190000	193000	I know what I'll do.
193000	195000	I know what I'll do.
195000	197000	I know what I'll do.
197000	199000	I know what I'll do.
199000	201000	I know what I'll do.
201000	203000	I know what I'll do.
203000	206000	I'll take the lid off the jar so you can get some fresh air, little dragon.
210000	212000	See? That better, isn't it?
212000	214000	Come on, little fella.
214000	217000	We'll give you a car to make you feel better.
217000	219000	Ow!
219000	222000	Oh, that burnt me!
223000	226000	What a fierce little dragon you are.
226000	227000	Don't worry.
227000	228000	I'll look after you.
228000	230000	I'll take good care of you.
230000	234000	And when you're bigger and start to like me, I'll take you swimming in the sea.
237000	238000	Oh, I'm sorry.
238000	239000	You must be starving.
239000	243000	I'll get you something from my nighttime emergency food box.
243000	245000	I've got lots of things in there.
245000	247000	It's bound to be something you like.
254000	255000	The one.
255000	257000	Take anything you want.
261000	262000	Oh.
282000	286000	Gosh, that's really clever, little dragon.
286000	289000	Move it. Lunch is ready.
289000	290000	Gummy!
290000	292000	Now you stay here.
292000	295000	Don't worry. I'll be back in no time at all.
295000	298000	Remember, you're my own little dragon.
306000	307000	Where's sniff?
307000	309000	I thought he was here as well.
309000	311000	He's collecting worms for fishing.
311000	312000	He'll be here soon.
312000	314000	We'll start without him then.
314000	318000	You know, Mama, certain people keep secrets in glass jars.
318000	319000	Secrets?
321000	324000	Oh, yes, a little secret that hisses.
325000	329000	Moment, Mama, I found this near the big puddle.
330000	332000	Thank you, sniff.
332000	335000	Moment, I told you I wanted it back.
335000	337000	It's my very best one.
337000	338000	Sorry, Mama.
338000	339000	I was so excited.
339000	341000	I must have left it when I found...
341000	342000	I mean, when I was...
342000	345000	And I'm sure you know who I mean by certain people.
345000	348000	Did you catch anything with the sieve, Moment?
348000	352000	Yes, he did. Something that's now hidden in his room.
352000	353000	Big mouth.
353000	355000	If it's a secret, little my.
355000	357000	Perhaps he doesn't want to tell anyone.
357000	359000	Yeah, probably because his new pet bites.
359000	362000	Well, it hasn't bitten you yet, hasn't it?
362000	364000	If it did, I'd bite it back.
364000	367000	Is it true? Does your secret really bite people?
367000	369000	Well, it couldn't bite very hard.
369000	372000	If it was small enough to go in a jar, could it, Papa?
372000	376000	I suppose certain people might keep other small things in jars,
376000	380000	beetles and spiders, mosquitoes, scorpions, or poisonous centipedes,
380000	383000	horrible things that multiply and multiply every week
383000	386000	and grow and grow until the jars are too small.
387000	389000	See? Like that.
389000	392000	And there'll be so many of them, thousands and thousands
392000	395000	and they'll take over moving valley and eat us all.
395000	397000	Oh, well, I haven't got a centipede.
397000	400000	Hmm, I wonder if centipedes come from outer space.
400000	402000	But this is the earth deer.
402000	405000	The rain could have brought them down from space, Mama, couldn't it?
406000	410000	Well, you could be right. It was raining very hard yesterday.
410000	412000	And it wasn't like ordinary rain.
412000	415000	I saw a puddle as big as a lake.
417000	419000	What's the matter, movement?
419000	421000	It isn't a centipede.
423000	425000	Ha, we're on the right track, though.
425000	428000	Well, I'm glad it's not a poisonous centipede.
428000	430000	I shouldn't have liked that.
438000	440000	Oh, you're asleep.
440000	442000	Moomin's little dragon.
446000	449000	Is it okay if I go see snuffkin, Mama?
449000	450000	Have you finished already?
450000	451000	Yes, I have.
451000	454000	Tell them they mustn't go into my room.
454000	457000	Or they'll have to take the consequence, sis.
457000	460000	All right, Moomin, I'll make sure no one goes in there.
460000	461000	I promise.
463000	466000	Oh, but he's gonna tell snuffkin' this secret.
466000	468000	I should think he is.
468000	471000	Best friends always come first, little my.
488000	490000	Hey, snuffkin.
490000	492000	Hi.
492000	494000	Fishing again?
494000	495000	Yep.
495000	500000	The cards told me that if I caught five menos, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south.
500000	501000	South?
501000	503000	You're joking.
503000	505000	Not at all. I believe in the cards.
505000	508000	But snuffkin, winter's not here yet.
508000	512000	I know that, but the cards tell you things for a reason, Moomin.
512000	514000	Oh, do they really?
515000	517000	But it would be awfully few when you waste snuffkin.
517000	518000	Just awful.
518000	520000	I mean, I'd be very lonely.
520000	523000	Well, anyway, who would I talk to or tell my secrets to?
526000	528000	Oh, snuffkin, quickly.
528000	530000	You must come back to Moomin house.
530000	531000	Now?
531000	532000	Yeah.
532000	534000	Well, I suppose I could fish later.
534000	536000	No, no. There's no point.
536000	538000	But I have to catch five menos.
538000	539000	Oh.
539000	541000	The fish won't bite after all is rain.
541000	542000	You'd catch nothing.
542000	545000	It'll be better to wait until it stops flowing so fast.
545000	547000	Well, perhaps you're right.
547000	549000	So what's this big secret all about?
549000	551000	Hey, Moomin.
552000	555000	Have you ever seen a dragon snuffkin?
555000	556000	No, of course not.
556000	560000	They all disappeared off the face of the earth many hundreds of years ago.
560000	563000	But perhaps they didn't all disappear.
563000	565000	What if there was one alive somewhere?
565000	567000	That's impossible.
567000	570000	It could be so small that it would go in a glass jar snuffkin.
570000	573000	Are you sure you're not daydreaming, Moomin?
573000	575000	But still, anything is possible, I suppose.
575000	577000	But you know me.
577000	580000	I have to see it right in front of me before I believe it.
585000	586000	Oh, where is it?
586000	589000	Mama promised me that she wouldn't let anyone in.
594000	596000	I'd not hear either.
596000	598000	Well, you were right, Moomin.
599000	600000	What?
605000	606000	Ah, there he is.
606000	608000	I think you've found a real dragon.
608000	610000	How do you get up there?
610000	611000	He mustn't fall.
611000	612000	He might lose his tail.
612000	614000	Don't move, little dragon.
614000	616000	And snuffkin, keep quiet.
616000	618000	You might get frightened and do something silly.
618000	620000	Don't worry, I'll soon have you down.
620000	622000	This will do. I'll lay it on the floor here.
622000	624000	Jump, little dragon.
624000	625000	Don't be afraid.
625000	628000	Come on, hold onto this and we'll bring you down slowly.
628000	629000	Don't panic.
631000	633000	I don't think it's a very good idea, Moomin.
633000	635000	You'll only scare him away.
635000	637000	Why don't you just leave him alone?
637000	639000	He'll come down when he's ready.
639000	642000	Dragons aren't helpless, you know, even little baby ones.
642000	643000	But he's so small.
643000	644000	Come to Moomin.
644000	647000	Come on, don't you understand?
647000	649000	Hold onto that and I'll listen to you.
649000	650000	Ah!
650000	651000	Ah!
651000	652000	Ah!
653000	654000	Ah!
658000	659000	Ah!
661000	662000	Look at him!
662000	664000	My dragon, come fly!
664000	665000	He's flying!
665000	666000	He's flying!
666000	668000	Come down, little dragon.
668000	670000	You might question or something.
670000	671000	Come down!
673000	674000	Oh!
679000	681000	Be careful, snuffkin.
681000	682000	He might bite!
696000	697000	I don't think so.
697000	699000	He's a very unusual pet.
700000	703000	I think he likes you more than me.
706000	707000	Ah!
708000	712000	What a charming little creature, Moomin.
712000	713000	He's lovely.
713000	714000	What's his name?
714000	716000	He's called Little Dragon.
716000	717000	Ha!
717000	718000	I don't think he's lovely at all.
718000	721000	Small but savage, if you ask my opinion.
721000	723000	That sounds just like you, little mind.
723000	724000	You think so?
724000	725000	Ow!
728000	729000	Yeah!
729000	731000	No, oh, oh, oh.
731000	732000	Oh!
734000	735000	Now look here.
736000	737000	Ah!
740000	743000	He seems to have a thing about ears, doesn't he?
743000	745000	Step snuffkins, why doesn't he bite him?
745000	747000	Go on, dragon.
747000	748000	Go on, baby!
748000	749000	He's really tasty!
749000	750000	Go on!
751000	754000	Good news, I think he's trying to heat up snuffkins coffee.
754000	756000	He must really like him.
759000	760000	Cleve a little thing.
760000	763000	Well, I hope he's careful with that hot breath.
763000	764000	We don't want to start a fire.
764000	766000	All right, that's enough.
768000	769000	He might be useful.
769000	771000	When he's bigger, we can put him in the cellar
771000	774000	and he'll be able to keep the whole house just like a furnace.
774000	776000	No, we will not.
784000	785000	Go away!
785000	786000	You passed!
788000	789000	Ow!
791000	792000	And you!
793000	795000	He only thought you were trying to get his fly.
795000	797000	I'll get him if he bites me again.
797000	799000	Just you watch me do it.
799000	801000	Come on, little dragon.
816000	817000	I'm sure that'll keep him quiet.
817000	818000	I'd better go.
818000	820000	Thanks for the coffee, Mumma.
822000	825000	Oh no, it'll suffocate him.
853000	855000	He only seems to like snuffkin.
855000	858000	Well, we all like snuffkin.
858000	860000	Stupid old dragon.
860000	862000	No, he isn't.
863000	866000	Mum and dear, why don't you take him to your room?
866000	868000	He'll be happier there.
871000	873000	This will be best for him.
875000	878000	Oh, I wonder if he'll come back to visit us.
878000	880000	Why did you do that?
880000	883000	He was cute and we could have always worn earmuffs.
883000	885000	You can visit him in snuffkin's tent.
885000	888000	I expect little dragons already sitting on his shoulder.
888000	890000	It doesn't matter anyway.
890000	892000	Snuffkin's going south soup.
892000	894000	They'll be able to go together.
894000	896000	Oh, my dear, Mumma.
896000	897000	Never mind.
903000	905000	Well, you're a bit of a problem.
905000	907000	I don't want you here, little dragon.
907000	908000	Come on, go away.
908000	910000	Go to Mumma.
910000	911000	Don't do that.
911000	914000	Oh, come on, please go to Mumma.
914000	917000	Look, you're very nice and it'll be fun to have you along.
917000	918000	But there's Mumma.
918000	921000	And he'd know you were here and you'd be upset.
921000	924000	Oh, there's another one.
932000	933000	That's the fifth.
933000	935000	Oh, dear.
938000	940000	Hmm?
942000	944000	Any luck?
944000	945000	Not bad.
945000	947000	Are you going far?
947000	949000	Oh, I'm fair away.
949000	951000	Would you like some fresh fish?
951000	953000	I'm sure you'll get hungry.
955000	958000	Yeah, what do you want in return?
958000	959000	A small favor.
968000	971000	Take this as far as you can, open the lid and just leave it.
971000	973000	What? Just leave it?
973000	977000	Yes, in a nice quiet place, with lots and lots of flies.
977000	979000	Flies? What's in there?
979000	980000	A dragon.
980000	982000	A dragon? Does it bite?
982000	983000	Well, it might.
983000	985000	This is a big favor.
985000	987000	I don't even like minnows.
987000	988000	Oh, they're not too bad.
988000	991000	If you roast them, keep the lid on.
991000	994000	But make sure you open it up later so it can catch the flies.
994000	997000	All right, as long as it doesn't try to bite me.
997000	999000	Don't worry, it won't.
1011000	1012000	Hello.
1012000	1013000	Hi.
1013000	1015000	Oh, oh, oh.
1015000	1016000	Where is he?
1016000	1017000	Who is that?
1017000	1018000	My dragon.
1018000	1021000	He must have come here, snuffkin.
1021000	1022000	Oh, really?
1022000	1025000	I thought he was home with you, sleeping in your room.
1025000	1027000	No, I let him out.
1027000	1030000	Ah, well, dragons are very fickle.
1030000	1032000	All they really care about is big fat flies.
1032000	1035000	It's best to forget about a movement.
1038000	1040000	Did you catch your five minnows?
1040000	1043000	No, you were right. The water is too fast.
1043000	1044000	Oh, really?
1044000	1046000	So I won't go south until winter comes.
1046000	1048000	You'll stay here then?
1048000	1051000	Well, I'm sure it wouldn't do to go against the cards.
1051000	1053000	Now what a movement, my friend.
1053000	1056000	Oh, that's great. You're staying snuffkin.
1056000	1060000	Fantastic. That's really, really good.
1060000	1063000	Ah, perhaps I shouldn't have painted the float bright red.
1063000	1066000	It might have scared those little minnows right away.
1066000	1067000	Okay, let's go.
1067000	1068000	Yeah.
1071000	1074000	That dragon was sort of stupid.
1074000	1075000	Baby dragons are.
1075000	1077000	They make the world's worst pets.
1077000	1079000	They never want to settle in one place.
1079000	1081000	Yeah, you're right.
1081000	1084000	It was very funny, though, when it bit little mice here.
1084000	1087000	I think it gave her a taste of her own medicine.
1089000	1093000	The movement was very happy that snuffkin was staying in movement valley
1093000	1096000	and not going south until winter.
1096000	1101000	And as for the dragon, well, who wants to be loved by a silly old dragon?
1101000	1108000	They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.
1108000	1115000	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1115000	1119000	They're always happy and always at play.
1119000	1123000	The movements are having fun day after day.
1123000	1126000	The movements.
1126000	1130000	The movements.
1130000	1137000	They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.
1137000	1144000	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1144000	1149000	They're always happy and always at play.
1149000	1152000	The movements are having fun day after day.
1152000	1156000	The movements.
1156000	1160000	The movements.
1160000	1166000	The movements.
1166000	1188000	Here they are for one and all.
1188000	1191000	The movements are about to come.
1191000	1194000	Come on and sit down here with me.
1194000	1199000	Here for you on your TV, they are the movements.
1199000	1202000	They are the movements.
1202000	1205000	So come with me, give me your hand.
1205000	1208000	I'll take you up to a moment land.
1208000	1211000	You can fly just like a bird.
1211000	1214000	Sing that song ever.
1214000	1216000	There were the movements.
1216000	1219000	There were the movements.
1220000	1222000	There were the movements.
1222000	1225000	There were the movements.
1225000	1228000	There was the movements.
1228000	1231000	There were the movements.
1249000	1279000	La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
1279000	1309000	The weather was far too beautiful for Moomin Papa to concentrate on writing his memoirs, so he went for a walk instead. Good morning, Mr. Hamilton. Ah, Moomin Papa. Have you found a new plan or something? I'm afraid not, and I think I must have examined every single plan in Moomin Valley. I know what you mean. There isn't a single person living here that I don't know. Ah, yes, yes, quite. Look, why don't you come over and have a conversation?
1309000	1338000	The top of tea, Mr. Hamilton. Hmm? Isn't that Moomin and Little My? Yes, I think it is. Really, Moomin Papa, peeping into people's homes. Oh, it's an empty house, Mr. Hamilton.
1338000	1368000	Moomin, what are you looking at? Oh, hello, Papa. Nobody's lived in there for years. Somebody's just moved in. Oh, really? Let me have a look. Oh, goodness. How tidy they are. Perhaps the children will play with us. Oh, they might, but they seem a bit too well behaved for that. I must have a closer look at them. Me too, Moomin Papa, but the trouble is they never come outside the fence. Well, in that case, we'll have to go in.
1368000	1398000	How do we do that, Papa? We can't just walk in there. See, you want to borrow some sugar? That should do it. Oh, Mr. Hamilton, where's your imagination? Will you please lend me your magnifying glass? But surely. Here it is. Oh, that should do it. What are you going to do, Papa? Now then, you all stay out here. My plan will only work.
1398000	1420000	Look, if it looks as though I'm on my own. Oh, but what is your plan, Papa? I hope Papa knows what he's doing. They don't look that friendly to me. Me neither.
1428000	1444000	Mama, there's someone coming. Oh, what do you want, my good man? Come on, tell me quickly. Do you hear me? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't think anyone lived here.
1444000	1454000	Well, we do know you know we just moved in. Really? Oh, do forgive me, Madam. I certainly didn't mean to trespass. Ah, so what are you doing here in the garden, man?
1454000	1470000	I'm researching the travel system of ants. I didn't know they had one. Oh, yeah, yeah, it's fascinating. How they find their way and build their roads, and they're not here now, of course. But this is their main road. It's very quiet at the moment, but at busy times, it's packed.
1470000	1482000	I'm afraid I can't see any main road. Oh, you would if you were an expert. Anyway, I'll point it out to you next time they're on the move if I'm in the vicinity, of course. But it's worth looking out for.
1482000	1490000	Welcome to Moomin Valley. I'm your next door neighbor, although we live quite a long way away. I'm Moomin. Ah, so you must be Moomin Papa, aren't you?
1490000	1499000	Ah, yes, that's me. How did you know? Did someone mention my name to you?
1499000	1510000	We were told the movements were a bit unusual. Very nice, they said, though. How very flattering. Thank you. And you're Mrs.
1510000	1524000	Philly Junk, mother and housewife. Well, it's an honor to meet you. Mrs. Philly Junk. Well done, Papa. It looks like you found us some new friends to play with. Oh, welcome party.
1524000	1532000	Don't you think it's a good idea? We haven't had a party for ages, Mama. But you hardly know them, and I've never even met them.
1532000	1538000	But Mama, how can we show them that they're really welcome and they could meet everyone at a party, couldn't they?
1538000	1549000	And I could take care of all the children. I know just what to do. Splendid, Moomin. Ah, Mr. Heaven, I know Moomin Papa. You'd like me to do the fireworks.
1549000	1561000	It looks like we're throwing a party. We'll have lots of pretty flowers. Just tell me what you want, Mama, and we'll do it.
1561000	1581000	It's great. Those kids will just love it. If they survive, Moomin.
1581000	1601000	Now then, children, the Moomin's are all a little bit odd, so behead properly. Yes, mother, we will. They'll be here soon. Take this in, Moomin.
1601000	1613000	Okay. The shoot works really well. Oh, good. I must try it. These look nice. Oh, stiff. Leave them alone, will you?
1613000	1624000	Oh, all right. Just this one. They're here. Come on, everybody. They'll soon be at the door.
1624000	1643000	Right. Come on, children. Help me with the flowers. Oh, dear. Fireworks now are later on. Oh, later on. I think you'll very hold finally.
1643000	1659000	Welcome to Moomin House, Mrs. Fitzgerald. It was very kind of you to invite us, Moomin, Mama. Come in, please, and make yourselves at home. Oh, thank you all very much indeed.
1659000	1670000	Welcome to Moomin Valley. All in my hair. It looks very untidy. Doesn't it, mother?
1670000	1682000	It's a surprise. They should have been rose buds, but we couldn't find any at all. Oh, yes. Dear, what a mess. Mrs. Philly chunk, let me introduce the children.
1682000	1698000	They all look different. Well, yes. Only Moomin is really ours. The others are sort of, I'm sure they'll all get on. Oh, I'm afraid my children do not play. They would much rather read or study.
1698000	1719000	Oh, are you sure they've got to have some time for play? I'm sure. Well, come into the dining room anyway. You can watch the others play. Make sure the chairs are clean. Yes, mother, we will.
1719000	1733000	Won't you let them play at all? No, I will not. Come on, everybody. Wouldn't you like to have a go on our slide? No.
1733000	1743000	Hmm. You'd really enjoy it once you got going. I know you would. No, thank you. No, no, not at all. No, definitely not.
1743000	1755000	And you're really quite sure, are you? Yes. I thought so. Then we've got it all to ourselves.
1755000	1767000	Moomin sounds like he's having fun.
1767000	1787000	Oh, and that's little May and sniff. Your children seem very quiet, Mrs. Billy Junk. Good children are seen and not heard right here.
1787000	1799000	That was one of mine. And that was another. Well, it sounds like they're having fun for once.
1799000	1805000	To have a biscuit, Mrs. Billy Junk. They have an unusual taste. I'd run out of flowers, so I used them.
1805000	1817000	Oh, don't worry, move them and look after them. Go on, it's your turn now.
1817000	1835000	My children. Stop it, it's too dangerous. You might hurt yourself.
1835000	1847000	Oh, come on, stop it at once. Now, don't you worry, Mrs. Billy Junk. I've got ointment in my bag if they hurt themselves.
1847000	1855000	But you'll hear mother.
1855000	1861000	Stop children, you hear me. We're going home now. Stop it.
1861000	1873000	I think it's time for the glorious finale, Papa.
1873000	1887000	I can't say I wasn't warned. Exposing them to this, Moomin Valley is no place for proper children. No place at all. Oh, dear, what's this?
1887000	1897000	There are fireworks in your honor. Fireworks. I made them especially to welcome you.
1907000	1913000	Goodbye, come back soon. Maybe tomorrow. No, you will not.
1913000	1921000	I don't think Mrs. Billy Junk enjoyed her party. She's very lucky that I didn't bite her.
1921000	1927000	She should have had a go on the slide. I'm sure she would have loved it, and then she wouldn't have shouted at her children.
1927000	1933000	Don't, don't slide down, shoot, sniff. They're too afraid of looking silly.
1933000	1942000	Oh, oh, Papa. Oh, I'm very sorry, Moomin, but don't worry, I'll fix it. It is nothing much broken.
1942000	1950000	What happened, my dear? Well, I thought it had been such a long time since I'd been on the slide that I'd have a go.
1950000	1960000	I didn't think I'd be too heavy for it. I know. When we mend it, why don't we make it strong enough for me and Mama to play on as well? I think she'd like that.
1960000	1965000	That's a good idea, Papa, but we want to use it too.
1965000	1970000	And that's a cool idea. I just try it out, now and again.
1978000	1982000	I want you to stay here while I'm out. What if somebody asks us to play?
1982000	1989000	What do you mean? Play. I hope you're not thinking of the Moomins, are you?
1989000	1994000	I don't want you mixing with those noisy children ever again. Do you hear me?
1994000	2001000	Where are you going, mother? To look for another house. It was a terrible mistake coming to Moomin Valley.
2011000	2017000	Look, there's Mrs. Philly drunk. Good afternoon. Please stay away from my children.
2017000	2023000	Oh, but why? We thought they might like to come and have an adventure with us.
2024000	2027000	Oh, never mind. Let's go.
2034000	2037000	Hey, hang on a minute.
2038000	2042000	Oh, you're Tarsam.
2063000	2066000	I can't see. It's too late for you now, snap.
2068000	2072000	Oh, no, not the hungry crocodile at the bottom of the courtyard.
2072000	2076000	We should have brought the Philly Junks with us. But Moomin missed his Philly Junks.
2076000	2082000	We need looked older. Have you been killed and eaten yet, Sniff?
2082000	2088000	No, I fell on top of the crocodile and knocked him out and then swam.
2088000	2091000	Sniff, but I thought you couldn't swim.
2091000	2094000	On your own business.
2094000	2097000	Hey, that looks like the Philly Junks.
2102000	2104000	Why don't they come over here?
2104000	2109000	I bet their mother told them not to talk to us. See if I care you.
2119000	2123000	Hey, what are you doing? Why aren't you playing with Moomin and the others?
2123000	2126000	I don't think they want to play with us.
2126000	2129000	They didn't call for us when they went past.
2129000	2132000	Stinky's arrived and wonder what he's doing here.
2132000	2135000	I bet you it's no fun stuck in that garden.
2135000	2138000	No, we'd rather be out here playing.
2138000	2143000	Well, I know somewhere much better than Moomin's. It's a great place to play.
2143000	2144000	Do you?
2144000	2150000	Yes, would I lie to you? It's a bit of a way off, but it'll be really exciting and lots of fun so do you want to come or not.
2151000	2153000	Well, it is a bit boring here.
2153000	2155000	Yes, very.
2155000	2159000	Oh, do you really think they don't want to play with us? Doesn't it look like it?
2159000	2163000	Your brother's absolutely right, so come on if you're coming because I can't wait.
2163000	2166000	What stinky up to? I don't trust him.
2181000	2186000	Okay, now this is the place I told you about. Good, isn't it?
2186000	2191000	Now, if you hang on to that rope, you can swing over to the other side and back again.
2191000	2194000	Don't worry, it's quite safe.
2194000	2199000	That's great. I've never been anywhere like this.
2199000	2201000	A bit frightening.
2201000	2204000	Without the thrill, where's the fun?
2204000	2207000	You need a bit of danger to spice it up.
2207000	2211000	Gee, Willikers, it looks like the other side is higher than this side.
2211000	2216000	Yes, I bet. It's all right. You just have to put your legs up, that's all.
2216000	2218000	Who wants to go first?
2218000	2221000	I've got it. Why don't you all go together?
2221000	2223000	What? The three of us?
2223000	2226000	See, this way you won't feel so scared, will you?
2226000	2228000	No, not together.
2228000	2235000	Well, why don't you go one at a time then? That way it's always more fun.
2235000	2237000	Can you do it, Stinky?
2237000	2241000	Don't be silly. Of course I can. I do it all at a time. One of the things I'm best at.
2241000	2243000	Even if I do say so myself.
2243000	2246000	So, why don't you show us, Stinky?
2246000	2248000	Move him!
2248000	2253000	I didn't know you were such a rope, Stinky. I'm sure he didn't either.
2253000	2257000	So, this is your usual place, isn't it?
2257000	2259000	Well, sort of.
2259000	2263000	You know something. If you hadn't said that you'd done this lots of times,
2263000	2266000	I wouldn't have believed that I could have done it myself.
2266000	2269000	Come on, Stinky. Show us how you do it.
2269000	2272000	If you go first, I'll be second.
2272000	2275000	No, it's all right. You can go first, Mom.
2275000	2280000	But I want to see how it's done. Then throw me the rope and I'll follow.
2280000	2285000	Now, tell the truth. You've never done it. Have you, Stinky?
2285000	2287000	Of course I've done it, stupid.
2287000	2291000	Now, come on. Come on. Don't be such a spoiled sport.
2291000	2294000	We're all here waiting to cheer you on.
2294000	2298000	All right, everybody. I give you the brave, involved Tarzan, Stinky.
2298000	2300000	Are you watching?
2300000	2302000	Are you ready, Stinky?
2302000	2304000	A big cheer, everyone.
2304000	2306000	Ready?
2306000	2309000	Oh, Stinky, my big brave here. Oh, jump!
2309000	2312000	Well, go on. We're all waiting for you, Stinky.
2312000	2315000	Come on, Stinky. Show us how it's done.
2315000	2317000	Come on, Stinky.
2322000	2325000	Yeah!
2334000	2338000	Oh, so this is how you've done it lots of times before, is it?
2338000	2342000	Yes, the rope must have shrunk.
2342000	2345000	He was trying to fool you. It was a dangerous game.
2345000	2347000	And he knew very well it couldn't be done.
2347000	2350000	I didn't.
2350000	2353000	Now, why don't you come with us and play properly?
2353000	2355000	You're gonna be Tarzan as long as you like.
2355000	2359000	And when you get tired, just let go of the rope. All right, Stinky?
2359000	2361000	Come on, Stinky.
2361000	2363000	You can't just leave me.
2363000	2365000	You're a fox.
2365000	2372000	And isn't fair, please help. Don't leave me here.
2380000	2383000	Yeah!
2383000	2388000	But Stinky was left on his own to decide whether to climb up the rope or drop into the river.
2388000	2392000	And the filajong children had more fun than they'd ever had before.
2392000	2395000	But they didn't get home until very late in the evening.
2395000	2397000	Bye, we'll see you tomorrow.
2397000	2398000	Okay, mommy.
2398000	2400000	Bye, Momen.
2400000	2402000	Bye-bye.
2404000	2407000	Oh, my dear children, I told you to stay at home.
2407000	2410000	What earth have you been? Where have you been?
2410000	2412000	With movement of the others.
2412000	2414000	They kidnapped you, did they?
2414000	2416000	No, we've been playing with them.
2416000	2421000	Well, you can just forget about the movements we're moving out as soon as we possibly can.
2421000	2423000	Moving, mother?
2423000	2425000	Yes, right away from this valley.
2425000	2429000	This is no place for a spotless and well-ordered home.
2429000	2431000	What's the matter?
2431000	2434000	No, we don't want to move.
2435000	2437000	We want to stay, mother.
2439000	2441000	Movement house is nice and dusty.
2441000	2444000	We want to stay in the movement valley forever.
2444000	2446000	Oh, please, mother, we love it here.
2446000	2450000	Oh, after all I've done for you children.
2450000	2454000	And my experience children usually get what they want.
2464000	2467000	It was for me.
2467000	2470000	I was for me.
2470000	2473000	I'm for you, I'm for you.
2473000	2477000	My dear ones.
2477000	2479000	I'm for you.
2485000	2490000	And that was how Phila Junk and her three children got married.
2490000	2493000	And that was how Phila Junk and her three children got married.
2493000	2497000	John and her three children became permanent residents of
2497000	2500000	Mumen Valley.
2500000	2507000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
2507000	2514000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
2514000	2518000	They're always happy and always at play.
2518000	2525000	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
2525000	2529000	The movements.
2529000	2536000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
2536000	2543000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
2543000	2547000	They're always happy and always at play.
2547000	2554000	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
2554000	2558000	The movements.
2558000	2564000	The movements.
2573000	2586000	Here they are for one and all.
2586000	2589000	The movements are about to come.
2589000	2592000	Come on and sit down here with me.
2592000	2594000	They're here for you on your TV.
2594000	2597000	They are the movements.
2597000	2600000	They are the movements.
2600000	2603000	So come with me, give me your hand.
2603000	2606000	I'll take you up to Mumenland.
2606000	2609000	You can fly just like a bird.
2609000	2611000	Sing that song ever.
2611000	2614000	There were the movements.
2614000	2617000	There were the movements.
2617000	2620000	There were the movements.
2620000	2623000	There were the movements.
2623000	2626000	There were the movements.
2626000	2629000	There were the movements.
2629000	2632000	There were the movements.
2632000	2635000	There were the movements.
2635000	2638000	There were the movements.
2638000	2641000	There were the movements.

2665000	2673000	There were the movements.
2673000	2679000	For a whole week, snorkew maiden had been curled up on the sofa, reading fairy tales.
2679000	2681000	It's a lovely day.
2681000	2690000	Last Mumen has persuaded her to come out for a walk in the lonely mountains.
2690000	2692000	Oh, it's beautiful up here.
2692000	2696000	Aren't you glad you came now?
2696000	2701000	This is much better than fairy tales, isn't it snorkew maiden?
2701000	2703000	Oh, look, Mumen.
2703000	2705000	It's Adelweis.
2705000	2709000	Adelweis?
2709000	2710000	No, it isn't.
2710000	2712000	That doesn't grow here at all.
2712000	2713000	I'm sure it is.
2713000	2715000	I know what it looks like.
2715000	2718000	I'm sorry, but it's not.
2718000	2721000	Oh, it's just like in Heidi.
2721000	2722000	No, it's not.
2722000	2724000	It's just a Daisy.
2724000	2725000	Oh, come on.
2725000	2726000	I want to pick it.
2726000	2728000	Oh, no, it's too dangerous.
2728000	2729000	I know then.
2729000	2730000	You can do it.
2730000	2733000	You're my boyfriend, aren't you, Mumen?
2733000	2737000	Well, I suppose we could climb down there, but I promise you it's not Adelweis.
2737000	2741000	That only grows in the Alps and there are hundreds of miles away.
2741000	2748000	I know it's Adelweis.
2748000	2749000	Be careful.
2749000	2752000	They don't care about danger in fairy tales.
2752000	2760000	That's why they call them fairy tales, silly.
2760000	2764000	Fair Princess, please accept this, my humble offering.
2764000	2765000	Thank you, Brave Knight.
2765000	2766000	You were right, Mumen.
2766000	2768000	This isn't Adelweis.
2768000	2770000	See, I told you.
2770000	2773000	It's going to be hard to get down from here, you know?
2773000	2775000	Can't we go back the way we came?
2775000	2779000	Well, I think it'll be easier to try to get to that path.
2779000	2784000	If you say so.
2784000	2786000	It's nearer anyway.
2786000	2788000	And better than going up.
2788000	2793000	I'm surprised you're such a good climber.
2793000	2797000	Oh, Royalty is good at practically everything.
2797000	2803000	It's not made of.
2803000	2810000	It's not made of.
2810000	2817000	It's not made of.
2817000	2822000	It's not made of.
2822000	2829000	Let me see six pebbles.
2829000	2831000	What was that?
2831000	2832000	A giant snowball?
2832000	2833000	It can't be.
2833000	2834000	It isn't winter.
2834000	2836000	Oh, well, nothing of interest to me.
2836000	2841000	Now, where was I?
2841000	2842000	We start handling.
2842000	2844000	Has snort maiden just gone past you?
2844000	2845000	Snort maiden.
2845000	2848000	No, all I've seen going past is a very large snowball.
2848000	2850000	That was snort maiden.
2850000	2855000	But she's not made of snow.
2855000	2856000	Stop!
2856000	2857000	Snort maiden!
2857000	2864000	Stop!
2864000	2874000	Snort maiden.
2874000	2875000	Snort maiden.
2875000	2877000	Snort maiden.
2877000	2878000	Oh, praise the booble.
2878000	2879000	She's still breathing.
2879000	2889000	She's just knocked her so out.
2889000	2891000	Oh, Mum and what's happened to her?
2891000	2892000	She's unconscious.
2892000	2895000	Oh, what are you trying to do?
2895000	2898000	I want to get her home to Mama.
2898000	2899000	Oh, difficult.
2899000	2901000	She should lose a bit of weight.
2901000	2906000	Perhaps she'd come around if we splashed cold water in her face.
2906000	2909000	Oh, there's nothing to fetch it in.
2909000	2915000	Ah, if you cut some bark off a tree trunk, you could make a small container.
2915000	2916000	What a good idea.
2916000	2921000	If you stay here, I'll go and do that.
2921000	2924000	Wake up, snort maiden.
2937000	2939000	Oh, that's cold.
2945000	2947000	Has she come around yet, Mr. Himulet?
2947000	2948000	No.
2948000	2950000	Okay.
2954000	2955000	Oh, good.
2955000	2956000	It's working.
2956000	2958000	How are you feeling, snort maiden?
2958000	2961000	Are you alright, snort maiden?
2961000	2963000	Where am I?
2963000	2966000	We're still up in Lonely Mountains.
2966000	2969000	Who am I?
2969000	2973000	Why Royal Highness the Princess of Lonely Mountains?
2973000	2974000	What?
2974000	2975000	A Princess?
2975000	2976000	Oh, yes.
2976000	2977000	Of course.
2979000	2981000	And who are you?
2981000	2983000	I am the Prince of Lonely Mountains.
2983000	2984000	Oh, yeah.
2984000	2985000	Oh, yeah.
2985000	2987000	With that ridiculous shape?
2987000	2988000	Ha.
2988000	2989000	No.
2989000	2990000	A gesture, perhaps.
2990000	2991000	You want?
2992000	2994000	You there.
2994000	2996000	Do not laugh.
3004000	3008000	I think the poor girl must have lost her memory.
3008000	3009000	Of course not.
3009000	3011000	She's just pretending.
3011000	3014000	When does not whisper with royalty present.
3014000	3015000	Do you hear?
3015000	3018000	So sorry, Royal Highness.
3021000	3024000	A poor crafters cabin.
3024000	3026000	This is your castle, ma'am.
3026000	3028000	Royalty doesn't live in shacks.
3028000	3030000	Snort maiden.
3030000	3032000	Stop calling us that.
3032000	3034000	It's very rude.
3034000	3036000	Oh, forgive me.
3036000	3038000	Our royal castle is elsewhere.
3038000	3039000	Is it not?
3039000	3040000	What?
3040000	3042000	That must be hunting lodge.
3042000	3043000	No, of course.
3043000	3044000	That's what it is.
3044000	3045000	Good.
3045000	3047000	We accept that.
3051000	3058000	Are you two going to tell me what you're so busy looking at?
3058000	3067000	Send a maid to my room, my good man.
3067000	3070000	A maid.
3070000	3077000	My good man.
3078000	3082000	Papa, have you seen Snort maiden?
3082000	3084000	Yes, up there.
3088000	3092000	Mama, please would you go on have a word with Snort maiden?
3092000	3094000	Have you been quarreling?
3094000	3095000	Oh, no.
3095000	3097000	It's just that she fell and banged her head,
3097000	3099000	and now she thinks she's a royal princess.
3099000	3101000	What?
3108000	3111000	Ah, Nanette, come here, please.
3111000	3114000	Nanette, I'm Boomin, Mama.
3114000	3118000	Oh, we're too wary for your foolish jokes, girl.
3118000	3121000	Oh, we are very tired indeed, Nanette.
3121000	3123000	Please bring our silk nightie
3123000	3126000	with the hand embroidered swans and clowns.
3126000	3128000	Then you may go.
3132000	3134000	I wish you, Mama.
3134000	3136000	All right, I'm sure.
3136000	3138000	But she seems convinced she's a princess.
3138000	3140000	Sounds as if it's dangerous, doesn't it, Mama?
3140000	3142000	Oh, I don't think so.
3142000	3145000	I was only joking when I called her a princess.
3145000	3147000	I'm very glad you didn't call her an opera singer.
3147000	3149000	It's Snort maiden asleep now?
3149000	3150000	Oh, yes.
3150000	3153000	In a night gown with crowns and swans embroidered on it.
3153000	3157000	And another thing, Boomin, she wants a canopy put up immediately.
3157000	3158000	What's that?
3158000	3162000	Oh, a fancy cover over the bed that's draped in silks,
3162000	3163000	silvers and tassels.
3163000	3164000	Oh.
3164000	3167000	She was very upset because there wasn't one there already.
3167000	3169000	It might be necessary.
3169000	3172000	Her memory could have come back by the time she wakes up.
3172000	3173000	Why don't we wait and see?
3173000	3175000	She might be fine after a rest.
3175000	3177000	I sure hope so.
3177000	3180000	But what do we do if it hasn't come back?
3180000	3182000	Let's think about that if it happens.
3182000	3185000	We might not have to build that canopy.
3185000	3186000	Let me try it.
3186000	3187000	John, what?
3187000	3190000	To get Snort maiden's memory back, what else?
3190000	3191000	Oh, how?
3191000	3194000	Well, I think that if she sees me, she'll remember me
3194000	3196000	and then she'll remember everything else, too.
3196000	3198000	Don't be silly little mind.
3198000	3201000	If she doesn't remember me, why should you remember you, eh?
3201000	3204000	Simple, because I'm unforgettable.
3204000	3206000	There is that, I suppose.
3212000	3214000	She's still fast asleep.
3214000	3216000	Well, I'm glad we made the canopy anyway.
3216000	3219000	It looks really great, doesn't it?
3220000	3223000	Oh, look, she's opening her eyes.
3224000	3226000	Are you awake?
3226000	3228000	Get up, Snort maiden.
3228000	3229000	Come on.
3229000	3230000	Let's go down to the beach.
3230000	3232000	And who is that person?
3232000	3234000	Come on, you remember me.
3234000	3237000	I warn you with you, though you'll be sorry.
3237000	3239000	Oh, quite amusing.
3239000	3241000	Ah, so you remember me now?
3241000	3242000	Of course we do.
3242000	3244000	There you are, I told you.
3244000	3246000	Who am I then?
3246000	3248000	Well, you're another court jester.
3248000	3250000	Of course.
3253000	3255000	Don't be little lie.
3255000	3257000	Court jester.
3258000	3260000	Oh, very funny.
3260000	3262000	She's a better clown than the other one.
3262000	3264000	You can perform at our wedding.
3264000	3266000	You're a wedding.
3267000	3268000	Hmm.
3271000	3275000	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, why?
3275000	3278000	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
3278000	3281000	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
3281000	3285000	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
3288000	3289000	Hi, stinky.
3289000	3291000	What are you doing here?
3291000	3293000	Moments asked me to come over to Moments House
3293000	3295000	and propose to some princess.
3295000	3298000	Moments lost his marbles as well then.
3298000	3300000	I think he wanted Stinky as a contrast.
3300000	3301000	You what?
3301000	3305000	You mean to tell me you're both my rivals for the hands of the royal princess?
3305000	3309000	Well, it's not very original, but in order to win the princess,
3309000	3313000	and have her kingdom, Stinky, you'll need to solve three riddles.
3313000	3317000	Hey, that's great! What's this kingdom like?
3317000	3320000	All right, sooner number one, you may now enter.
3320000	3322000	Oh, that's me.
3325000	3327000	Oh!
3327000	3331000	Oh, hi, princess! How are you doing?
3331000	3334000	Jester, is this man a suitor?
3334000	3335000	He is.
3335000	3337000	I fear he does not treat us with respect.
3337000	3339000	Forgive him, your highness.
3339000	3341000	He is from a foreign land.
3341000	3345000	And does not know the ways of your kingdom.
3345000	3347000	Hmm.
3347000	3349000	Well, all right, very well.
3349000	3351000	Here is the first riddle. Are you ready?
3351000	3353000	Are you awake?
3353000	3355000	Now then, listen, what is it that is yellow?
3355000	3357000	Has four legs and sings?
3357000	3359000	Oh, dear. And unusual, canary?
3359000	3362000	With four legs, you nincomboop.
3362000	3364000	I don't know any birds with four legs.
3364000	3366000	Who said it was a bird?
3366000	3368000	Oh, I don't know.
3368000	3369000	I don't know.
3369000	3370000	I don't know.
3370000	3371000	I don't know.
3371000	3372000	I don't know.
3372000	3373000	I don't know.
3373000	3374000	I don't know.
3374000	3376000	Who said it was a bird?
3376000	3379000	All right, then. What's the answer, snark baby?
3379000	3381000	He shows no respect.
3381000	3384000	Throw him into a dungeon and give him no food.
3384000	3385000	You're highness.
3385000	3388000	He is temporarily out of his mind after the long journey here.
3388000	3390000	Hang on. I'm not out of my mind.
3390000	3391000	God, up she is.
3391000	3394000	How so what's the answer? That's what I want to know.
3394000	3397000	Silence. It does not concern you.
3397000	3400000	We believe you to be of lowly birth.
3405000	3407000	Sorry about this, napkin.
3407000	3408000	Don't worry.
3411000	3414000	Hmm, no, sir Gellad, but not bad.
3414000	3417000	I am honored to be here, your royal highness.
3417000	3418000	He'll do.
3418000	3420000	An easy riddle to start.
3420000	3421000	Here it is.
3421000	3425000	First, what is the number of which we think?
3425000	3426000	Take your time.
3426000	3427000	Two?
3427000	3430000	For a faux-galat night, that is correct.
3430000	3433000	Now listen, what is the word upon our mind?
3434000	3435000	Love.
3435000	3436000	That's amazing.
3436000	3439000	Truly, the suitor has brains as well as looks.
3439000	3440000	Question three.
3440000	3442000	There are two numbers on our mind.
3442000	3443000	What do they add up to?
3443000	3444000	Answer carefully for it.
3444000	3446000	Could unlock your princess's heart.
3446000	3448000	Twenty-one.
3448000	3451000	Oh, was that right, too?
3451000	3454000	Oh no, it was twenty-two.
3460000	3462000	My heart is heavy.
3462000	3464000	For chance we should have said it was correct.
3464000	3466000	He was rather cute.
3466000	3468000	Was he not just her?
3468000	3470000	It's your turn now, stinky.
3470000	3474000	Well, I suppose that even half of Snort Toss would be something.
3475000	3477000	Think she'll ever get her memory back?
3477000	3479000	Of course she will.
3479000	3482000	This is not our idea of a suitor.
3482000	3485000	His heart is aching for you, your royal highness.
3485000	3487000	Ah, let it ache.
3487000	3488000	Oh, alright.
3488000	3489000	I'll give him a chance.
3489000	3491000	Here is a question number one.
3491000	3493000	What is the number we are thinking of?
3493000	3496000	Well, of all our stupid questions.
3496000	3498000	We haven't all day.
3498000	3502000	Oh, well, four.
3502000	3504000	Indeed not.
3504000	3508000	It is three million five hundred ninety-eight thousand seven hundred and sixty-five.
3508000	3510000	Be gone out.
3510000	3512000	Hey, Snort Toss, that's not fair.
3512000	3514000	What fruit is up with his hands?
3514000	3515000	It's not fair, right?
3515000	3516000	It's not fair, right?
3516000	3517000	Go home.
3517000	3519000	Give me another one I want after.
3519000	3521000	Oh, what a rude suitor.
3521000	3524000	We are no longer in the mood for royal marriage, Jester.
3524000	3526000	At least not today.
3526000	3528000	A wise decision.
3528000	3530000	A princess of the lonely mountains.
3530000	3532000	They will be prostrated with grief,
3532000	3534000	but bid the other suitors to go home.
3534000	3536000	Do not let them beg.
3536000	3537000	We would not like that.
3537000	3539000	Very well, your royal highness.
3539000	3540000	Do it kindly.
3540000	3542000	We wish them no pain at all.
3542000	3544000	From this day on, we shall devote ourselves to good works
3544000	3547000	and to the well-being of our people.
3547000	3549000	Oh.
3549000	3552000	You know, I didn't want to marry you anyway.
3552000	3554000	Wonder what Snort Maiden's up to now?
3554000	3556000	Upstairs thinking.
3556000	3559000	She says she'll devote her life to good works.
3559000	3561000	Work? What works?
3561000	3565000	I don't know, but she probably wants to be remembered in the history books.
3565000	3569000	The princess who was adored by her subjects.
3569000	3573000	Oh, she's coming down.
3574000	3576000	Your royal highness.
3576000	3578000	May I assist you?
3578000	3580000	Send the net to us.
3580000	3582000	She is on an errand, your highness.
3582000	3586000	Then have someone else make soup, nourishing but not too rich.
3586000	3588000	Soup, highness?
3588000	3589000	Yes indeed.
3589000	3593000	And then we shall take it to our poor subjects ourselves.
3593000	3595000	What kind of soup?
3595000	3596000	We don't know.
3596000	3597000	We eat.
3597000	3598000	We don't cook.
3598000	3601000	The poor will be happy with anything brought by the princess herself.
3602000	3603000	Now hurry, ma'am.
3603000	3604000	Be quick about it.
3608000	3610000	No, she wants some soup.
3614000	3615000	This will be ample.
3615000	3616000	The poor do not eat much.
3616000	3618000	It would only make the meal.
3618000	3621000	I don't know anyone poor around here, your majesty.
3621000	3623000	Nonsense.
3624000	3630000	One, two, one, two, one.
3639000	3641000	Greetings, jester.
3641000	3642000	What now?
3642000	3644000	We're taking soup to the poor.
3644000	3646000	Made with our own regal fingers.
3646000	3648000	Do you know where they are, jester?
3648000	3649000	Your fingers?
3649000	3650000	Oh, I know.
3650000	3651000	Good, wonderful.
3651000	3653000	Take us to them now.
3653000	3655000	They will be so grateful.
3655000	3657000	You back princess.
3663000	3664000	That house there.
3664000	3665000	Oh yes.
3665000	3669000	It's nice to know that the poor and my kingdom are so well off.
3681000	3684000	Oh you, please come over here.
3684000	3685000	Hmm?
3685000	3686000	Will you?
3686000	3689000	I'm the princess of Lonely Mountain.
3689000	3691000	Princess?
3691000	3692000	Oh!
3692000	3694000	What moment you're all highness?
3694000	3696000	Do not keep us waiting.
3696000	3698000	We have a lot to do.
3698000	3699000	I'm coming.
3699000	3700000	I'm coming.
3700000	3703000	Forgive me you're all highness.
3703000	3705000	I had no idea you were.
3705000	3708000	My, my, smart maiden.
3708000	3709000	That common name again.
3709000	3710000	We are princess.
3710000	3711000	Little sticks.
3711000	3713000	You're not right in the head.
3713000	3715000	Coming here bothering your elders and betters like this.
3715000	3716000	My betters?
3716000	3717000	Oh!
3717000	3719000	Are you the queen then?
3719000	3720000	Hmm?
3720000	3721000	I am Mrs. Philly Johnk.
3721000	3722000	Now what do you want?
3722000	3726000	You're just fulfilling our royal duty, bringing soup to the poor.
3726000	3729000	Giving cheer to those less fortunate that ourselves.
3729000	3730000	Here my good woman.
3730000	3732000	Now if you just pour.
3732000	3734000	Oh there you call me, poor.
3734000	3737000	You who doesn't have a stitch of clothing to your name.
3737000	3738000	Oh!
3738000	3741000	The rich aroma of the soup must have overcome you Mrs. Philly Johnk.
3741000	3742000	Ah!
3742000	3745000	Eat it yourself your majesty.
3745000	3747000	Ah!
3747000	3749000	This is how I treason.
3749000	3750000	Send for the guard.
3750000	3752000	Take her to the tower.
3752000	3753000	Oh!
3753000	3754000	Oh!
3754000	3755000	We cannot see.
3755000	3760000	I'm afraid that serves you right, snork maiden.
3760000	3761000	Snork maiden!
3761000	3764000	Don't use that common name.
3764000	3765000	Help us.
3765000	3766000	We cannot see.
3766000	3767000	Please stand still.
3767000	3768000	Your royal highness.
3768000	3769000	Oh hold a moment.
3769000	3770000	Oh!
3770000	3771000	Oh!
3771000	3772000	Oh!
3772000	3773000	I think it's stuck moment.
3773000	3774000	Use the handle.
3774000	3775000	Ah!
3775000	3776000	Stop!
3776000	3777000	You're hurting me.
3777000	3778000	Right, I'll get it on.
3778000	3779000	Out of the way.
3779000	3781000	Ah!
3781000	3782000	Wait a minute.
3782000	3784000	You can't break that soup, Turin.
3784000	3785000	It's a family heirloom.
3785000	3788000	And you mustn't hit snork maiden on the head.
3788000	3789000	You might hurt her.
3789000	3791000	Stop falling around and get this thing off will you?
3791000	3792000	All right.
3792000	3793000	Oh!
3793000	3795000	Of course, smart maiden.
3795000	3798000	You didn't have to hit her that hard.
3798000	3800000	Difficult to judge it with a broom.
3800000	3802000	I've never hit anyone wearing a soup, Turin, before.
3802000	3804000	You will write your royal highness.
3804000	3806000	Oh, forgive us, your royal highness.
3806000	3809000	Sprinkle some cold water over her face.
3809000	3811000	No, she'd hate that, mama.
3811000	3812000	Snork maiden.
3812000	3814000	Ah, it's no good, woman.
3814000	3818000	I don't think she'll wake up to anything but your royal highness.
3818000	3819000	Your highness.
3820000	3821000	Your highness!
3821000	3822000	Your highness!
3822000	3823000	Your highness!
3827000	3828000	Snork maiden.
3828000	3831000	Oh, I'm so glad your royal highness is with us again.
3831000	3834000	I hope your royal highness is not badly hurt.
3834000	3835000	Oh...
3837000	3838000	Where am I?
3838000	3840000	In moment, Valley, of course, stupid.
3840000	3841000	Where do you think?
3841000	3842000	That's weird.
3842000	3846000	I thought, moment, and I had gone for a walk in the lonely mountains.
3846000	3848000	Didn't we, moment?
3849000	3850000	Huh?
3850000	3852000	Do you remember who I am, Snork maiden?
3852000	3853000	Moment.
3853000	3855000	What are you talking about, of course I do.
3855000	3857000	And you don't think you're a princess anymore?
3857000	3858000	Princess?
3858000	3859000	Have you gone crazy or something?
3859000	3860000	What princess?
3860000	3861000	What do you mean, moment?
3861000	3862000	Hooray!
3862000	3863000	She's back to normal.
3863000	3865000	Snork maiden's back to normal.
3865000	3868000	Yes, it's nice to have you back again.
3868000	3869000	Yes, it's wonderful.
3869000	3871000	Welcome home.
3871000	3872000	What is?
3872000	3873000	What's wonderful?
3873000	3875000	Have you all gone loopy or something?
3875000	3877000	Never mind, Snork maiden.
3877000	3880000	Ha ha, you bumped your head, that's all.
3880000	3885000	And so Snork maiden's brief spell as a royal princess came to an end.
3885000	3888000	Except that she was the only one who didn't remember it.
3888000	3891000	But everyone else in moment Valley breathed a sigh of relief.
3897000	3903000	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the romance.
3903000	3910000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
3910000	3914000	They're always happy and always at play.
3914000	3918000	The movements are having fun day after day.
3918000	3921000	The movements.
3921000	3925000	The movements.
3925000	3932000	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
3932000	3939000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
3939000	3944000	They're always happy and always at play.
3944000	3947000	The movements are having fun day after day.
3947000	3951000	The movements.
3951000	3955000	The movements.
3955000	3961000	The movements.
3961000	3983000	Here they are for one and all.
3983000	3986000	The movements are about to come.
3986000	3989000	Come on and sit down here with me.
3989000	3991000	They're for you on your TV.
3991000	3994000	They are the movements.
3994000	3997000	They are the movements.
3997000	4000000	So come with me, give me your hand.
4000000	4003000	I'll take you up to a moment land.
4003000	4006000	You can fly just like a bird.
4006000	4008000	Sing that song ever.
4008000	4011000	There were the movements.
4011000	4014000	There were the movements.
4014000	4017000	There were the movements.
4017000	4021000	There was the movements.
4021000	4024000	There was the movements.
4024000	4027000	There was the movements.
4027000	4057000	Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
4057000	4087000	Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da dat da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
4087000	4093000	However, we do know that they don't look like this because this is Sniff, one of Moonman's friends.
4117000	4141000	So it looks as though the rumor was right.
4141000	4144000	Oh, what rumor was that?
4144000	4148000	That we were about to be invaded by aliens from outer space.
4148000	4153000	Oh, dear, do you mean that thing that was chasing me might have been one of them?
4153000	4154000	Well, yes.
4154000	4157000	I thought they were just after me.
4157000	4164000	I wouldn't have thought you'd have been that important to them Sniff, but I suppose you never know, do you?
4164000	4172000	It says here in this book that aliens from outer space are very civilized and peace-loving and would never want to invade us.
4172000	4175000	It seemed as though they're quite happy where they are.
4175000	4178000	I do, it's not a very scientific book.
4178000	4182000	Well, it was definitely attacking me, Mom and Papa, I know it was.
4182000	4185000	Well, it might have been a civilization from another planet, Sniff.
4185000	4188000	They were just hungry.
4188000	4193000	Well, the inspector told me that he thought we were being invaded by aliens, and he shouldn't know.
4193000	4195000	I'm sure he's exaggerating.
4195000	4197000	I wonder what they look like.
4197000	4200000	Why don't you come and help me in the garden?
4200000	4203000	You never know, we might see one.
4209000	4211000	Mama, wait for me!
4217000	4219000	Mama, what's that?
4219000	4222000	Well, I would say it's not a vegetable, that's for sure.
4222000	4225000	It looks like a flying saucer.
4225000	4228000	I wonder if there are any aliens in it.
4228000	4230000	They might be heard, Mama.
4230000	4232000	Let's have a look.
4243000	4246000	I think there's something there.
4249000	4250000	This looks odd.
4250000	4252000	I wonder what it is.
4252000	4254000	It's a bit like a radio, isn't it?
4254000	4256000	Oh yeah, an alien radio.
4256000	4259000	Do you think there's anyone in there moving?
4261000	4263000	Anybody there?
4264000	4267000	It seems to have been deserted.
4267000	4270000	There's a funny noise coming from it.
4270000	4274000	Well, it doesn't look to me like it could fly again.
4274000	4275000	It could be repaired.
4275000	4277000	You'd need to know about flying saucers.
4277000	4279000	Papa could do it?
4281000	4285000	I don't think flying saucers should make that sort of noise.
4285000	4287000	Do you, woman?
4287000	4290000	I don't think so, but I don't know very much about them.
4290000	4293000	It does seem a bit odd as if they've said it to be blown up
4293000	4295000	so that no one would be able to steal it
4295000	4297000	because they want to keep the design a secret.
4297000	4299000	Do you think it will?
4299000	4301000	Oh!
4302000	4305000	I'm not sure, Mama, but let's get away in case it does explode.
4305000	4309000	That's why it's empty, but I wish it hadn't landed in the Asparagus patch.
4309000	4311000	I'll take the radio with me.
4318000	4320000	It won't be too long now, Mama.
4320000	4322000	No, it won't.
4323000	4325000	It won't be long, then.
4327000	4329000	It's vanished.
4329000	4330000	Bless my soul.
4330000	4333000	Papa's book said they could be a very advanced life form.
4340000	4344000	There's nothing to show it was ever here,
4344000	4348000	except the hole in the ground, and this radio thing.
4352000	4354000	Hmm.
4354000	4356000	Is it a radio, Papa?
4356000	4359000	I don't know. It looks a bit like one.
4359000	4362000	Let's try pressing one of these buttons.
4362000	4364000	The red one first, I think.
4370000	4372000	Oh!
4380000	4382000	Papa, where have you gone?
4382000	4384000	Well, I'm right here, Boomin.
4384000	4387000	I wonder what happens if I press this one.
4387000	4390000	Well, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't see you either, dear.
4390000	4392000	What?
4395000	4397000	Oh, I see.
4400000	4402000	So if you press the red button, you'll become invisible.
4402000	4404000	What a fascinating machine.
4404000	4407000	Papa, I think I'd rather see you, dear.
4407000	4409000	Well, of course you would.
4409000	4412000	Well, then let's try the yellow one.
4412000	4414000	I think. Can you see me now?
4414000	4416000	No, Papa.
4416000	4417000	Oh, that's odd.
4417000	4419000	Do you want me to try, Papa?
4419000	4420000	Please, Mama.
4420000	4422000	There, that's it.
4430000	4433000	Oh, Papa.
4433000	4435000	Oh, that's a very dangerous machine.
4435000	4437000	I don't want to disappear ever again.
4437000	4439000	It's not a nice experience.
4439000	4442000	No, dear. I didn't like you vanishing like that.
4442000	4446000	We must put it somewhere safe, Mama, where the children can't find it.
4446000	4448000	Yes, dear.
4449000	4451000	What?
4454000	4455000	Moment!
4455000	4457000	Snork maiden, what an earth's the matter.
4457000	4459000	We found a strange creature.
4459000	4460000	Strange creature?
4460000	4462000	I think it's an alien.
4462000	4464000	Does it look like a jellyfish?
4464000	4466000	No, not at all.
4466000	4469000	Little mice keeping an eye on it. Come on!
4475000	4477000	Where are you going, Moment, Papa?
4477000	4478800	Going me, I don't know, Especial.
4478800	4480240	Moving mama, hang on.
4480240	4482680	I've got a few questions for you.
4482680	4483920	Really, Inspector?
4486920	4488840	I was told that a flying saucer
4488840	4492520	had landed in your garden, but all I can see is a big hole.
4492520	4493520	Where is it?
4493520	4495280	What have you done with the saucer?
4495280	4496400	Nothing.
4496400	4497560	Well, where is it?
4497560	4499440	It's not there now.
4499440	4502360	It was there, but then it just vanished.
4502360	4503600	Vanished?
4503600	4505560	Yes, that's right.
4505560	4508920	When you say vanish, do you mean it flew away again?
4508920	4511800	No, it just went, woof, gone.
4511800	4513800	Moments are it, too.
4513800	4514840	That's very odd.
4514840	4516200	Yes, it was.
4516200	4519520	Did you see any aliens on board by any chance?
4519520	4520760	No.
4520760	4522640	Are you telling me the truth?
4522640	4523680	Of course.
4523680	4525440	Why should I lie to you?
4525440	4527040	Well, I can't.
4527040	4528240	Think of any reason.
4528240	4530720	I'm sorry, but it's upsetting aliens
4530720	4532520	invading Moment Valley.
4532520	4533600	Yes, it is.
4533600	4534880	Can we go now?
4534920	4537400	Certainly.
4537400	4539920	Where are you all going, by the way?
4539920	4542880	Oh, only to the beach to collect shells.
4542880	4545480	See you, Inspector.
4545480	4549240	Collecting shells, indeed, while I'm hunting for aliens.
4551560	4553640	Ah, over here!
4553640	4555840	Ah, ah!
4555840	4557080	Ah, ah!
4558080	4560280	Ah, ah!
4560280	4562320	Do you know what I'm doing?
4562320	4565760	Ah, ah, ah!
4565760	4567240	Is that an alien?
4567240	4570000	It certainly is, but not like it says in the book.
4570000	4571440	Have you tried talking to it?
4571440	4573280	Yes, but it wouldn't answer.
4573280	4574800	Well, let me try.
4574800	4577920	Are you from outer space?
4577920	4578720	Go show what, Lee.
4578720	4580760	What, Lee, do I see Duckidackadale in Dublin?
4580760	4582080	Yes, Lee, do I see Duckidackadale?
4582080	4584920	I've never been.
4584960	4587720	It looks like an alien child to me.
4587720	4589000	More like a lamp.
4589000	4589880	Poor thing.
4589880	4591240	He must be hungry.
4591240	4592840	Let's take him home.
4592840	4596080	Yeah, well, we don't want the inspector to see him.
4609560	4610520	That is nothing.
4610520	4611840	It's not under a bottle of love.
4611840	4621640	I'm sorry we can't understand you, but I'm sure you'll like milk, even if you don't
4621640	4622640	speak English.
4622640	4623840	Just try it and see.
4627840	4629680	I think he's missing his home.
4629680	4632200	Wherever in the universe that might be.
4632200	4634120	I wonder where his parents are.
4634120	4635560	He can't have come on his own.
4635560	4637240	He seems far too little for that.
4637240	4639280	Well, I don't know.
4639280	4643080	But he's obviously missing him, and he seems very unhappy.
4643080	4646520	Do you think the inspector would really arrest him, Owen Papa?
4646520	4647520	Possibly.
4647520	4649720	He would think it is duty.
4649720	4652200	Well, that would be horrible of him.
4652200	4653200	I know.
4653200	4654600	Don't touch me.
4654600	4657720	Don't touch me.
4657720	4659840	Oh, it's inspector.
4659840	4660440	Oh, dear.
4660440	4664320	He mustn't find him here.
4664320	4667000	And he's got stinky with him.
4667000	4668000	No, stinky.
4668000	4669320	Well, that means trouble.
4669320	4670320	Quick.
4670320	4671320	He can hide in the kitchen.
4671320	4672320	We got to do something.
4672320	4673320	And quickly.
4673320	4674320	I know what to do.
4674320	4675320	What, Mama?
4675320	4676320	We'll use the machine.
4676320	4677320	Oh, yeah.
4677320	4698720	We'll just keep him out of sight.
4698720	4704960	Now, then, this one, right?
4705960	4709960	Oh, dear.
4709960	4711960	I think they're here.
4711960	4713480	Oh, moving Papa.
4713480	4719280	I heard there was an alien here with what?
4719280	4725280	What's happening?
4725280	4726280	What's happened to me?
4726280	4727280	Goodness, inspector.
4727280	4728280	You're very shiny.
4728280	4729280	Oh, dear.
4729280	4730280	Yes.
4730280	4731280	How very, very strange.
4731280	4734520	You look like a great big glow worm.
4734520	4738480	An inspector in shining armor, you mean, little my?
4738480	4740720	That's just what I thought.
4740720	4743560	You will never need a lamp to be seen, inspector.
4743560	4744560	I like it.
4744560	4746320	Criminals will be afraid of me.
4746320	4750760	I can't wait to get back to the station and show the constables.
4750760	4752360	Handy for reading in bed, too.
4752360	4754360	Well, duty calls.
4754360	4755360	Bye.
4765040	4766520	What are you doing?
4766520	4768720	I didn't know that the machine was still working.
4768720	4770720	Oh, you can speak English.
4770720	4771720	Of course I can.
4771720	4774320	It's just that I need my language converted to help me to translate.
4774320	4776600	And if you hadn't taken it from my ship and hidden it,
4776600	4778760	I would have been able to talk sooner.
4778760	4781440	That's a good way to learn, isn't it?
4781440	4782440	Where are you going?
4782440	4784520	To see that nice shiny man.
4784520	4786400	But he'll arrest you.
4786400	4789400	He came here looking for you, but he forgot about it
4789400	4793840	when the machine started him glowing.
4793840	4796000	No, don't go there.
4796000	4797200	Hey, wait.
4797200	4798960	I love that lint of shimmer.
4798960	4804000	It's just like, oh, it makes me feel really safe.
4804000	4805840	Hello, hello, inspector.
4805840	4807400	Yes, what is it?
4807400	4808840	Take me with you.
4808840	4810440	What?
4810440	4813840	Oh, you're so bright and beautiful inspector.
4813840	4815600	Oh, you think so?
4815600	4817600	Hello, everyone, shimmers like that.
4817600	4818280	Everyone.
4818280	4820760	Well, that must be very nice for them.
4820760	4822760	I want to pose you, please.
4822800	4826800	I'm sorry, I'm too busy, but it was nice talking to you.
4826800	4829600	You see, the aliens have invaded Movement Valley,
4829600	4832200	and I must find them.
4832200	4835200	Oh, I just remembered.
4835200	4839200	I was tipped off that there was one of them in Moomin House.
4839200	4840200	Oh.
4845320	4847960	The inspector's coming back.
4847960	4849120	What about the alien?
4849120	4850680	He's running after him.
4850680	4852640	Has he been handcuffed, Moomin?
4852640	4853720	I don't think so.
4860440	4863680	Open up in the name of the law, Moomin Papa.
4863680	4865560	Certainly for you, inspector.
4865560	4866400	Come on in.
4866400	4868840	You're very welcome.
4868840	4872040	Moomin Papa, I have information from a reliable source
4872040	4875720	while sort of reliable that you have been harping
4875720	4876800	a fugitive.
4876800	4878640	I'm sorry.
4878640	4882600	In other words, I believe you have been hiding an alien here.
4882600	4884840	Oh, inspector, I don't think hiding is the right word.
4884840	4887360	That suggests we are trying to keep something from you.
4887360	4888760	Well, Moomin?
4888760	4890480	Would we do that, inspector?
4894160	4897920	That stinky is tricked me again.
4897920	4899800	Isn't it lucky he didn't find you?
4899800	4902040	I want a nice inspector.
4902040	4904120	Look, how many times must I tell you?
4904120	4906040	He'll lock you up in an nasty cell.
4906040	4906880	I like him.
4906880	4908520	I want to see him.
4908520	4909520	No, don't.
4913600	4916600	Perhaps if we press the yellow button, he'll stop shining.
4916600	4917600	Good idea, Papa.
4917600	4919600	Be quick, Mama.
4919600	4921600	The yellow button.
4921600	4922600	Here goes.
4937600	4940600	You don't want him now that he stopped shining.
4940600	4942600	Do you, little fella?
4942600	4944600	Let's go home, man.
4944600	4946600	Moomin, Mama, come and look.
4946600	4948600	We've saved the alien.
4949600	4953600	Moomin, Mama, the inspector's not glowing anymore.
4953600	4955600	Isn't that something?
4955600	4956600	Mama.
4961600	4962600	Mama.
4962600	4964600	Where are you, man?
4964600	4965600	I'm here.
4966600	4967600	Hey, what?
4968600	4970600	Where are you, Mama?
4972600	4974600	Well, Mama.
4974600	4975600	Right here.
4978600	4980600	Mama.
4980600	4981600	Oh, no.
4981600	4982600	What's happened to you?
4982600	4983600	I don't know.
4983600	4985600	Probably that machine again.
4985600	4988600	Oh, so it shrinks you as well as making you invisible, does it?
4988600	4989600	Well, well.
4989600	4991600	Oh, dear.
4991600	4992600	I need an apron.
4992600	4995600	Papa, can you get a handkerchief from my handbag?
4997600	5000600	You really are quite small.
5000600	5003600	That you look very cute, of course, Mama.
5003600	5005600	Would you like to stay like that for a while?
5005600	5006600	No, but I would not.
5006600	5009600	Push another button quickly before anyone sees me.
5009600	5010600	Go on now.
5010600	5011600	Hurry up, Papa.
5011600	5013600	Yeah.
5013600	5014600	Oh, dear.
5014600	5016600	What's up?
5016600	5018600	The machine's gone.
5021600	5023600	Hey, you!
5023600	5025600	Taking it back!
5026600	5027600	Papa.
5027600	5028600	Don't worry, Mama.
5028600	5030600	I'll get it back.
5038600	5040600	Look, not that way.
5041600	5042600	Stop him, Moments.
5042600	5043600	Stop him.
5043600	5045600	He stole the machine.
5045600	5047600	We'll get him, Papa.
5049600	5050600	Hey, Sniff.
5050600	5051600	Sniff.
5051600	5053600	Don't let Steve keep getting away.
5053600	5054600	Right.
5056600	5058600	Inventory!
5062600	5064600	Please let me pass, Sniff.
5064600	5065600	I'll give you a gold stopper.
5065600	5066600	A gold stopper?
5066600	5067600	I mean, free.
5067600	5068600	No, no, five.
5068600	5069600	Five?
5069600	5070600	No.
5070600	5072600	Give me the machine, Stinky.
5079600	5080600	Where is it, Moments?
5080600	5082600	What's happened to the machine?
5085600	5088600	It's at the bottom of the river, Papa.
5088600	5091600	Oh, poor Mama. Poor Mama.
5091600	5092600	What's wrong with her?
5092600	5095600	Well, she needs the machine to get back to normal.
5095600	5096600	Normal?
5103600	5107600	Well, at least this is a chance to do some really fine embroidery.
5107600	5109600	Don't worry, Mama.
5109600	5111600	I promise we'll look after you.
5112600	5114600	It's all right, Moomin.
5114600	5115600	I'll manage.
5115600	5117600	I'll have to get some smaller pots and pans, though,
5117600	5120600	and we'll have to have smaller helpings.
5120600	5122600	But that might be a bad idea.
5128600	5129600	Oh.
5142600	5143600	Here.
5143600	5144600	Here.

5195600	5197600	Oh, my God.
5197600	5199600	This is a very bad idea.

5201600	5202600	I'm sorry, Mama.
5202600	5203600	I'm sorry, Mama.

5216600	5219600	My parents, we still thank you for looking after me.
5219600	5221600	But, I faced with a very very...
5221600	5223600	They're telling you all, aren't they?
5223600	5226600	Yes, because I took a flying saucer.
5226600	5231600	Look, would you ask your parents to make mama a normal size again?
5231600	5232600	Yes, of course.
5234600	5236600	Fiddler grassly grassly girl.
5236600	5238600	Don't bring him.

5257560	5262360	I know, the more a mama there is, the better what you're getting very large, very large indeed.
5262360	5266360	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
5279600	5286240	So movement valley hadn't really been invaded at all and the movements and the

5448880	5458880	there were the movements there were the movements there were the movements there were the movements
5479120	5496400	movement valley is enjoying another still peaceful summer's day however this lazy lifestyle no
5496400	5507440	matter how pleasant it might be does not suit everyone oh yes would you like a cup of coffee
5507440	5517840	dear yes I think I need one mama oh dear is it your memoirs I'm stuck ah can I help how can I
5517840	5525600	create in this in what in this sleepy atmosphere I've also come to a boring part when was that the time
5525600	5537200	I wrote poems were they any good no well miss that bit out then I can't I must put it down for
5537200	5544640	posterity it is my duty but how can I get inspiration here in this place when nothing ever happens
5544640	5552800	nothing ever happens at all oh I think this means another adventure yes mama that I need it to be
5552800	5562640	big exciting and frightening mama what's the matter are you all right your father says that
5562640	5568320	because nothing ever happens here he can't write so I'm looking for an adventure for him can you
5568320	5574240	think of anything he wants it to be big exciting and frightening does he want something really exciting
5574320	5579680	yes dear I'm afraid so I think I could manage that
5589440	5592080	that looks like the footprint of a huge monster
5592080	5605280	oh it's a good feeling giving others a bit of excitement
5606240	5622880	hey hey hey hey hey hey just a couple more yeah hey I'm praise the booboo I don't have to
5622880	5627360	the modest work very often yeah that was harder than I thought
5630160	5641840	oh sleepy hands wake up everybody moment papa quickly get up moment mama a monster you've been
5641840	5651920	visited by a monster wake up before you eat in a line come on hurry hurry my what huge tracks
5653600	5655760	that's to keep them guessing for a while
5658880	5662240	hmm it could be a monster from the depths of the ocean
5663200	5667360	something's not right here don't you think it's a bit odd that it came directly to move
5668240	5670720	well look at the footsteps they go in a straight line
5672320	5674720	someone must have told it to go to a moment house
5678160	5682560	and they're only going one way look there are tiny footsteps going back to the sea
5682560	5688000	oh now that the monster must still be here then oh well not necessarily
5688720	5694000	retracing one's own footsteps is the sign of an advanced intelligence stepping back exactly
5694000	5700160	the way you came the tough question is why would the monster do that one is led to believe that
5700160	5706320	it wants us to think it's still here when in fact it has gone back to wherever it came from
5706800	5713280	fiddle battle is my dear mother would say but why would it want us to think that papa it's a spy
5714240	5719360	oh it's a spy something it shouldn't it is hardly be a good spy if we knew they have to sneak in
5719360	5729440	and out I think it's still here I can feel it you know what I mean perhaps tonight tonight what
5729440	5734560	about tonight that's when they'll attack it's gone back to give its report how do you know that
5734560	5742800	papa well obviously that's why it still wants us to believe it's here yes what is it moving
5742800	5748560	something terrible is going to happen a monster is going to attack us tonight and papa's excited
5748560	5758160	about it oh good that's nice for him hurry everyone I expect the monster will be here soon
5765920	5771440	now hold it still this is going to be a good barricade don't you think
5771920	5778800	we'd better make sure it's big enough it's hardly any fun the tall playing tricks on them they're so
5778800	5788880	gullible if we catch the monster we can sell it to a zoo I'll handle the sale of course I'd rather
5788880	5794080	tame it and keep it as a pet well you could ride on it to go pigni-king
5810240	5815520	right now for the moat here we go hope the wells got enough water in it
5815840	5823680	it'll be able to swim in this papa yes it'll remind you to the sea and keep it calm
5825120	5832080	this is fresh water papa we'd better put some salt in it good idea moment we'll plant some seaweed
5832080	5842560	and put some rocks in too and then it'll feel really at home I wonder when it'll come
5843520	5849360	I don't know but I can feel in my bones it'll be tonight and we keep watch until it comes
5849360	5855040	of course we will constantly what if it doesn't come until tomorrow night or the night after that
5855040	5861120	it might be a long wait so we'll take it in turns and remember everybody the safety of
5861120	5865040	Moomin Valley relies upon our vigilance we must be ready

6648560	6650560	Papa, how was your adventure?
6650560	6652560	Uh, unexpected.
6652560	6654560	Yes, that's what I'd say.
6654560	6656560	Unexpected. Any food.
6656560	6658560	Oh, yes. You can try mine first, Mumen, Papa.
6658560	6660560	Oh, mine's the best. Try mine, Papa.
6660560	6662560	Oh, that's good. I'm starving.

6672560	6674560	Suppose there's adventure.
6674560	6676560	I don't think Papa wants to talk about his adventure yet.
6676560	6678560	Maybe later.
6678560	6682560	And that was the end of Mumma and Papa's adventure.
6682560	6686560	They didn't get far, but then you don't have to sometimes for things to happen.

6832560	6836560	There were the movements.
6836560	6840560	There were the movements.
6840560	6846560	There were the movements.
6846560	6856560	There were the movements.
6856560	6872560	It was the end of summer, but still every day seemed harder than the last.
6872560	6878560	The movement valley had no rain for weeks, and finally the river had dried up.
6878560	6882560	Papa says this weather is a catastrophe snuffing.
6882560	6884560	But it is.
6884560	6890560	He says the movement valley will turn into a desert if it carries on.
6890560	6894560	Papa can't ever remember it so hot, even the river has dried up.
6894560	6896560	No, that does worry me.
6896560	6898560	I can't fish anymore.
6898560	6904560	The travels I found that droughts like this are always followed by a real heavy downpour.
6904560	6910560	Well, it's too hot for me anyway.
6918560	6924560	Oh, it's so hot I can't think.
6924560	6932560	I can, I can always think of something.
6932560	6940560	Well, well, even the weeds are wilting.
6940560	6952560	The sea never dries up, does it?
6952560	6956560	Of course not stupid wherever the fish go.
6956560	6960560	I'm going swimming.
6970560	6990560	Here you are.
6990560	6994560	Watch this.
6994560	7004560	Look at that.
7024560	7034560	Ah!
7034560	7044560	Ah!
7044560	7056560	Ah!
7056560	7058560	Ouch, that hurt.
7058560	7060560	What's this stupid box doing here?
7060560	7062560	I think it's floated from foreign lands.
7062560	7064560	What's it got in it?
7064560	7066560	Perhaps it's full of priceless jewels.
7066560	7070560	No, it wouldn't float so high in the water if it was.
7070560	7072560	A tiara packed in wood shavings.
7072560	7076560	I could use a new comb too.
7076560	7078560	What have you found you too?
7078560	7080560	It's a treasure.
7080560	7082560	No, we don't think so.
7082560	7084560	It's not heavy enough.
7084560	7086560	But you never know, Snork Maiden.
7086560	7088560	Let's open it and see.
7088560	7092560	Come on, Slays, push me a shore.
7092560	7094560	Perhaps it's gold nuggets in here.
7094560	7098560	Our diamonds are something to eat.
7098560	7108560	Ah!
7108560	7110560	What is this?
7110560	7112560	Seeds maybe.
7112560	7116560	What sort of seeds?
7116560	7118560	Hmm.
7118560	7122560	Well, at first glance I'd say they might be tropical plants.
7122560	7124560	Oh, really?
7124560	7126560	What plants are tropical?
7126560	7128560	It's like banana or mango.
7128560	7130560	Banana and mango.
7130560	7134560	Well, I haven't done a lot of research on tropical plants so I can't be sure,
7134560	7136560	but they do look like it.
7136560	7138560	I know, Mama. Why don't we plant them?
7138560	7140560	Good idea, woman.
7140560	7144560	The thing is, we don't have a tropical climate.
7144560	7146560	I'm afraid they wouldn't grow here at all.
7146560	7148560	Let's plant them, shall we?
7148560	7150560	They won't bear any fruit, so don't get too excited.
7150560	7154560	Oh, well, it seems tropical enough to me, Mr. Hanuman.
7154560	7156560	At least we can try, can't we?
7156560	7159560	I want to see what papaya looks like and ugly fruit.
7159560	7162560	I want mangoes growing all around my bedroom window.
7162560	7166560	Let's plant them, shall we?
7166560	7172560	I tell you they're strictly tropical. They won't take root at all.
7184560	7188560	It certainly seems that Mama is enjoying herself, Mr. Hanuman.
7188560	7190560	I don't think it'll be much use.
7190560	7194560	Well, perhaps not, but it's still worth the farm in trying.
7194560	7198560	Imagine, woman valley, a tropical jungle.
7198560	7204560	Oh, Mr. Hanuman, do you think these seeds will grow into real fruit trees?
7204560	7206560	Hmm.
7207560	7213560	Oh, Mr. Hanuman, do you think these seeds will grow into real fruit trees?
7213560	7215560	Hmm, let me see.
7215560	7217560	What have you got here, little my?
7217560	7223560	I could very well be mistaken, but I think this one is a mango seed.
7223560	7225560	Hmm, thanks.
7225560	7228560	And why do you want to know, little my?
7228560	7230560	Because I'm only growing fruit.
7230560	7235560	I want to be sure I'm not planting stupid orchids or passion flowers or something.
7235560	7238560	Ha, ha, ha.
7238560	7243560	Mr. Hemuman, can you tell me which one of these is banana?
7243560	7246560	Yeah, I'm not really too sure, but I think it's this one.
7246560	7249560	Do you want to grow an orchid too, snorkemaiden?
7249560	7252560	No, I just want to plant a banana tree in a really special place.
7252560	7256560	It's Mouin's favorite fruit.
7259560	7263560	I think she'll be disappointed bananas won't grow here.
7263560	7266560	Hmm, this weather doesn't belong here either.
7266560	7268560	If it gets any harder, I'll melt.
7268560	7270560	I can't wait for dusk, so it'll cool down a bit.
7270560	7272560	Hmm.
7282560	7285560	Isn't it wonderful to go to sleep looking at the stars?
7285560	7287560	And it's not so hot anymore.
7287560	7290560	I'll sleep like a log tonight.
7290560	7293560	Oh, you always do, don't you, little my?
7293560	7296560	Well, I'll sleep like an extra heavy log, then.
7301560	7306560	Snorkemaiden, why don't you sleep under that tree with Mouin and little my?
7306560	7311560	Oh, because I can't see the stars from there, and it makes me feel romantic looking at them.
7311560	7315560	But you're going to get very wet if it starts raining in the night.
7315560	7317560	You're joking, surely, Mama.
7317560	7319560	Not at all.
7319560	7323560	But it hasn't rained for ages, and there aren't any clouds or anything.
7323560	7325560	Just stars.
7325560	7328560	All the toothpicks fell on the floor, and that's a sure sign of rain.
7328560	7331560	Snorkemaiden won't mind if she gets all wet, Lumen Mama.
7331560	7334560	That should be happy.
7334560	7336560	Who? Why is that?
7336560	7342560	Because then she'll know that the special tree will start growing, and that's very important to her.
7342560	7344560	That's true.
7344560	7348560	Good night, everyone. I hope you sleep well.
7350560	7352560	Good night, everybody.
7366560	7368560	Good night, Lumen.
7368560	7370560	Good night. Don't snore.
7371560	7373560	Good night.
7386560	7389560	It's too hot to sleep.
7389560	7392560	Why don't you sleep outside like the children?
7392560	7394560	I think I will.
7401560	7405560	A thunderstorm.
7405560	7409560	I told you the toothpicks are never wrong.
7417560	7421560	Oh! Hey, it's raining, Lumen!
7421560	7424560	Wake up, Lumen!
7424560	7426560	Oh, is it morning?
7426560	7428560	The sun's really bright.
7428560	7430560	No, it's raining.
7430560	7432560	Rainy?
7432560	7434560	Look at that.
7434560	7437560	You look, I'm getting wet. I'm going inside.
7437560	7439560	So Mama was right about the rain.
7439560	7442560	Hey, Snorkemaiden!
7442560	7444560	Doesn't she look sweet?
7444560	7446560	Snorkemaiden!
7446560	7448560	Is it raining? That's very clever.
7448560	7451560	Your mother knows everything doesn't she?
7451560	7452560	She does.
7452560	7453560	Now let's get into the house.
7453560	7456560	Not yet. I want to feel the rain on my face.
7456560	7459560	It's been so long.
7462560	7465560	Ha! Do you want to feel it much longer?
7517560	7521560	Oh, it's stopped raining.
7528560	7532560	Mangoes! That's impossible!
7532560	7534560	Gosh!
7537560	7541560	By my tail, a jungle! That's a tropical jungle!
7547560	7551560	Wake up! Wake up, you two!
7551560	7555560	There's a jungle outside. We've planted a jungle!
7557560	7560560	A jungle?
7563560	7567560	You're right, Moments. Those seeds have not only sprouted.
7567560	7569560	I know. They're big trees.
7569560	7571560	I've never known trees to grow like that.
7571560	7573560	That's... that's...
7573560	7576560	I think I'll go and play Tarzan.
7576560	7580560	I wish my lettuce seeds would do that and move in, Papa.
7580560	7584560	There's magic here somewhere, Mama. Let's go and explore.
7586560	7590560	That's rain drumming on the campus.
7596560	7598560	It must be...
7598560	7601560	Snorkemaiden!
7603560	7605560	What a nurse all this!
7605560	7609560	Well, we found a crate of tropical seeds and planted them last night.
7609560	7612560	And this morning, while you can see it's like magic.
7612560	7614560	It's fantastic.
7614560	7617560	I know. We can go on a safari.
7621560	7624560	I've seen nothing like it.
7626560	7628560	What kind of flower is this?
7628560	7630560	It looks like an orchid to me.
7630560	7633560	This is a real tropical jungle, isn't it, Snorkemaiden?
7633560	7634560	Not quite.
7634560	7635560	What do you mean?
7635560	7639560	Well, Moomin, a real jungle would have wild animals in it, wouldn't it?
7639560	7641560	Oh, yeah. Like tigers and snakes.
7641560	7645560	This is more of a tropical botanical garden, I suppose.
7654560	7656560	That's Moomin's little mind.
7656560	7658560	He can have the peel.
7661560	7663560	This is a life!
7666560	7668560	Stop, Moomin!
7668560	7670560	Well, well.
7673560	7675560	What are you looking for, dear?
7675560	7676560	My solar toady.
7676560	7677560	You what?
7677560	7680560	My sun helmet. I can't go into the jungle without it.
7680560	7682560	I didn't know you had one.
7682560	7684560	I used it for a fancy dress party once.
7684560	7686560	Oh, I put it in a box.
7686560	7687560	Oh, yeah.
7687560	7689560	Oh, here it is.
7689560	7691560	Very dashing, dear.
7691560	7692560	I thought so, too.
7692560	7694560	Oh, I know.
7710560	7713560	Splendid protection is had.
7719560	7721560	Papa?
7721560	7723560	What in earth are you doing?
7723560	7725560	I want to get into the cello.
7725560	7727560	What for?
7727560	7729560	To get my gun.
7729560	7730560	Your gun?
7730560	7733560	Only fools venture into the jungle without a proper gun.
7733560	7736560	I don't think you need a gun, Papa.
7736560	7737560	And why not?
7737560	7739560	Because there aren't any wild animals.
7739560	7743560	Well, one of the seas might have been an egg or something.
7744560	7747560	Look at these, for instance, they look very animal.
7749560	7751560	Very odd animals.
7751560	7753560	More of an odd plant, I think.
7753560	7754560	I'd stay away from them.
7754560	7756560	They could be very dangerous.
7756560	7758560	Look, they've got eyes.
7758560	7759560	Careful.
7759560	7761560	I think they're man-eating plants.
7761560	7763560	Man-eating.
7763560	7766560	Stop that.
7766560	7768560	Help!
7768560	7769560	Help!
7769560	7771560	Oh, they're trying to eat me.
7771560	7773560	But they want to feed me to their young.
7773560	7775560	Oh, oh, oh, oh, help me!
7775560	7777560	Oh, help!
7777560	7779560	They're tearing my tail up!
7779560	7783560	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
7783560	7785560	Oh, no, oh, dear.
7785560	7789560	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.
7789560	7791560	Help!
7791560	7797560	Oh, oh, oh, no, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
7797560	7799560	Well, done my little Maya.
7799560	7801560	Just saved my life.
7801560	7803560	Well, I saved your tail, anyway.
7803560	7805560	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
7805560	7808900	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
7808900	7811480	Get something to jam this door shut.
7811480	7814040	Come on, hurry!
7814040	7820620	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, we can't hold on much longer.
7820620	7822620	Huh?
7836620	7838620	That should keep them in now, shouldn't it?
7838620	7841620	Well, I don't think they could push their way through that lot.
7841620	7843620	They had a very strong grip on my tail.
7843620	7845620	He mustn't underestimate them.
7845620	7846620	Anything wrong?
7846620	7851620	You bet! The seller's full of man-eating plants trying to gobble up moment papa!
7851620	7854620	Oh! Oh my goodness!
7854620	7855620	What's the matter?
7855620	7858620	You can get straight from the seller into the kitchen!
7858620	7861620	What? Oh no, mama!
7862620	7864620	Oh my gosh!
7874620	7876620	Oh, hello!
7876620	7878620	Cue, we got here just in time!
7878620	7881620	Whatever's the matter with you, are you all playing Tarzan?
7881620	7883620	Oh no, mama!
7883620	7886620	I'm making grandmas if you ever get a tropical fruit recipe.
7886620	7889620	And perhaps now it's rained I can wash this dirty floor.
7892620	7899620	Oh, by the great bumble, I don't believe this a tropical rainforest.
7899620	7904620	Oh, a transcendentia megaloids.
7904620	7907620	And yes, a dyspepsia floremon.
7907620	7912620	Goodness me, I can collect a whole tropical hermoreum right here in moment valley.
7912620	7916620	I try, well, that's what I need. I'll get one from the Mormons.
7922620	7925620	Oh, yeah, yeah.
7925620	7930620	Must say they're not the tiniest family, I'll have to move this.
7930620	7934620	Oh, this old furniture.
7945620	7947620	Do I look that funny?
7947620	7949620	No, you look great!
7949620	7952620	Maybe you and Tarzan have different muscles.
7952620	7954620	Me, Tarzan!
7954620	7955620	You, Jay!
7955620	7956620	Oh, oh!
7956620	7958620	Oh, here we go.
7958620	7961620	Me, get out, or me, sick!
7963620	7964620	Help!
7964620	7967620	I've got man-eating plants after this!
7967620	7970620	What? They must have come out!
7980620	7984620	They were in the cellar.
7984620	7987620	Did you open the door, Mr. Hamilon?
7987620	7990620	Well, yes, I wanted to borrow a trowel.
7990620	7993620	Mr. Hamilon, you know all about plants.
7993620	7995620	Do you have any idea how we can get rid of them?
7995620	7997620	They're man-eaters, you know?
7997620	7999620	Can't rid of them.
7999620	8002620	Well, let's see. We are in a bit of a fix.
8002620	8005620	I have heard that they react to music.
8005620	8007620	Music.
8007620	8010620	Snuffkin, you could play your harmonica.
8027620	8029620	Look, they've started dancing.
8029620	8031620	Keep it up, Snuffkin!
8037620	8040620	Music.
8048620	8051620	What will they do if he stops playing?
8051620	8053620	I really don't know.
8059620	8061620	Oh, what's this?
8068620	8073620	They're rather sweet and they don't try to eat you.
8073620	8078620	And that was how a tropical jungle grew and surrounded
8078620	8080620	movement house in one night.
8080620	8083620	Is it going to stay and for how long?
8083620	8088620	And what will the man-eating plants do if Snuffkin stops playing?
8092620	8095620	They love the laughter and they love the living.
8095620	8098620	The movements.
8098620	8106620	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
8106620	8110620	They're always happy and always at play.
8110620	8114620	The movements are having fun day after day.
8114620	8117620	The movements.
8117620	8121620	The movements.
8121620	8124620	They love the laughter and they love the living.
8125620	8128620	The movements.
8128620	8136620	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
8136620	8140620	They're always happy and always at play.
8140620	8143620	The movements are having fun day after day.
8143620	8147620	The movements.
8147620	8150620	The movements.
8150620	8153620	The movements.
8153620	8156620	The movements.
8176620	8179620	Here they are for one and all.
8179620	8182620	The movements are about to come.
8182620	8185620	They want to sit down here with me.
8185620	8188620	They're here for you on your TV.
8188620	8191620	They are the movements.
8191620	8194620	They are the movements.
8194620	8197620	So come with me, give me your hand.
8197620	8200620	I'll take you up to a moment land.
8200620	8203620	You can fly just like a bird.
8203620	8206620	Sing the best song ever.
8206620	8209620	There were the movements.
8209620	8212620	There were the movements.
8212620	8215620	There were the movements.
8215620	8218620	There were the movements.
8218620	8221620	There were the movements.
8239620	8265820	The seeds that movement and his friends had found in a box that had been cast up on the
8265820	8273820	beach had grown into a tropical forest. It was beautiful but also dangerous with man-eating plants
8273820	8281820	kept at bay by snuffkin playing his harmonica, but for how long?
8296820	8303820	snuffkin don't stop playing your harmonica whatever you do or they'll only get angry and attack us all over again.
8303820	8307820	If I don't stop soon I might never want to play again.
8309820	8313820	Well perhaps the music has made them more friendly.
8313820	8318820	Be careful Mr. Himmelon. Oh don't worry.
8326820	8328820	Mr. Himmelon look out.
8332820	8334820	I want him.
8334820	8337820	I don't think the quickly snuffkin play again.
8356820	8367820	Papa we must make sure the trap door won't open again.
8367820	8370820	Oh yes. What's this about a trap door?
8370820	8375820	In the kitchen they almost got him before in the tag mama. We reached her just in time.
8375820	8378820	Oh there they are.
8406820	8408820	I feel sorry for them.
8419820	8426820	It can't be helped snuffkin. If we let them out we'll be eaten alive.
8428820	8433820	It makes me feel very uncomfortable having man-eating plants under the floor.
8433820	8438820	Always keep a kettle of boiling water handy in case they break through.
8438820	8441820	The children are playing Tarzan.
8441820	8445820	They might as well seeing as they've got a jungle to play in.
8445820	8448820	Still planting those seeds might have been a terrible mistake.
8448820	8457820	Well mama I'm very glad that you did. Just think what I would have missed and movement values suddenly being full of tropical plants is wonderful.
8457820	8461820	I'm not fond of traveling as you know and you've brought the plants to me.
8462820	8468820	Well the trees make it much cooler but those man-eaters who I could do without them.
8476820	8478820	You're just like Tarzan.
8478820	8480820	Tarzan loves Jane.
8480820	8482820	Oh what bliss.
8485820	8487820	Stinky's over there.
8487820	8490820	Tarzan teach old Betty's lesson.
8505820	8510820	Pretty stupid moment playing Tarzan without wild animals.
8510820	8512820	Animals don't come from seeds.
8512820	8516820	No but you need them to have a real jungle. I can get you some if you want.
8516820	8517820	Really?
8517820	8519820	How do anything for my friends?
8519820	8524820	That's very kind of you. Not too wild though. No lions or tigers or anything.
8524820	8527820	Maybe it maybe chimpanzee.
8527820	8530820	I know exactly what you need.
8533820	8535820	Cheese.
8535820	8537820	Bread.
8541820	8543820	What are you doing mama?
8543820	8547820	Well I don't like the thought of all those man-eaters still in the cellar.
8547820	8550820	So your father and I are going to sleep in the bathhouse.
8550820	8554820	We'll sleep outdoors too. We've just built ourselves a hut.
8554820	8556820	Snorke maiden and little Mai too.
8556820	8558820	Oh yes there's plenty of room.
8558820	8562820	Oh right so that only leaves Mr. Himmel and sleeping in the house.
8562820	8565820	And he still busy checking all the different plants.
8567820	8569820	Mama is everything ready?
8569820	8571820	Oh yes dear.
8574820	8576820	Oh I'm already.
8576820	8578820	Yes we are Mr. Himmel and.
8578820	8580820	See you later.
8586820	8590820	Stinky said he could get some wild animals papa.
8590820	8592820	We'll have a frog.
8592820	8593820	I don't know.
8593820	8596820	I wouldn't trust him. He'll probably put a head jog in your sleeping bag.
8596820	8599820	There it is. The hut.
8599820	8602820	Oh very well built.
8629820	8637820	I tell you it's a wonderful place you love it. A real tropical jungle.
8637820	8639820	Are you sure it's quite nice here?
8639820	8643820	Of course I am. There you are.
8643820	8645820	Oh.
8659820	8666820	Oh lovely it is to run free.
8666820	8673820	Darling let's be the first to get to Moomin Valley.
8673820	8680820	Soon I'll have the largest collection in the botanic world.
8680820	8685820	And I will be famous and people will come from all over.
8685820	8690820	Now what have we here?
8690820	8693820	I don't know.
8693820	8700820	Go away I'm not a zoologist.
8700820	8705820	Look Moomin those must be the monkey stinky promise.
8705820	8710820	Well that's a surprise not like him at all.
8710820	8714820	I don't know.
8715820	8720820	Look Moomin those must be the monkey stinky promise.
8720820	8723820	Well that's a surprise not like him at all.
8723820	8727820	I just don't trust him.
8727820	8728820	What sweet things.
8728820	8732820	Just like in Tarzan.
8732820	8735820	What was that?
8735820	8737820	I don't know.
8737820	8746820	That sounds like some really wild animal.
8746820	8748820	A lion or a tiger.
8748820	8755820	I'm frightened Moomin.
8761820	8766820	Very odd just like home isn't it even if it isn't very big?
8766820	8768820	Perhaps we could live here.
8768820	8772820	Let's go hunting first I smell Moomin's.
8772820	8780820	Oh be careful darling you're very out of practice.
8780820	8786820	I must warn them.
8786820	8788820	See anything?
8788820	8789820	No other thing.
8789820	8793820	It must have been imagination.
8793820	8795820	Moomin.
8795820	8797820	Keep quiet.
8797820	8800820	I've just seen some tigers they're coming to get you.
8800820	8801820	Tigers.
8801820	8803820	Let's get back to the house quick.
8803820	8806820	There's no time they're nearly here.
8806820	8810820	We'll go to the bathhouse.
8824820	8826820	Shall we eat him up?
8826820	8830820	You know that Hamilins upset your tummy dearest.
8830820	8834820	I wonder where the Moomin's are.
8834820	8837820	Huh?
8840820	8844820	Just more animals that's all.
8845820	8851820	Papa!
8851820	8854820	Papa help!
8859820	8861820	What's the matter Moomin?
8861820	8864820	Little Maya's seen two tigers and they're looking for us.
8864820	8865820	Tigers after us.
8865820	8869820	That rotten sticky probably told them we're good to eat or something.
8869820	8871820	Maybe we are.
8871820	8873820	They'll be here in a minute.
8873820	8876820	Right Moomin, you go and find the biggest stone you can
8876820	8878820	and bring it back with you.
8878820	8880820	Okay.
8889820	8892820	This way.
8903820	8905820	Papa will this one do?
8905820	8906820	Yes, that's perfect.
8906820	8909820	Right, get into the bathhouse and it's quickly now.
8934820	8936820	Here they come.
8942820	8944820	Are you really going to eat them, dearest?
8944820	8945820	Of course, my love.
8945820	8949820	You see, I think they're hiding in that little house up there.
8949820	8953820	They're being very quiet if they are.
8953820	8958820	Huh, they're just too scared to move. That's all.
8958820	8961820	Why's that stone there?
8964820	8966820	Whoa!
8969820	8971820	My darling!
8971820	8972820	It worked, Papa!
8972820	8974820	Well, of course, Moomin.
8976820	8978820	My husband is drowning.
8978820	8982820	Oh, I'm so sorry. Papa, we must help.
8982820	8985820	He was just about to try and eat us, Mama.
8985820	8988820	I'm sure he won't do it again.
8989820	8993820	I suppose so, Moomin.
9012820	9014820	Oh, my love!
9014820	9016820	I never thought I'd see the day.
9016820	9019820	Moomin's rescuing a tiger.
9020820	9021820	Here you are, dear.
9021820	9024820	Tie this tightly around him and we'll lift him out.
9024820	9026820	Thank you, Mama.
9044820	9046820	Oh, darling.
9047820	9049820	Oh, you are right, my love.
9049820	9051820	What happened? Did we eat them?
9051820	9053820	No, you were drowning and they rescued you.
9053820	9056820	Oh, now embarrassing.
9056820	9059820	Well, they're in that cabin behind you if you still feel hungry,
9059820	9062820	but it was rather good of them to save you.
9062820	9065820	No, my appetite's completely gone.
9065820	9067820	We'll come back here then and we'll go.
9067820	9069820	I'll just jump over.
9074820	9076820	Oh.
9076820	9078820	What's the matter?
9078820	9080820	I can't remember how to jump.
9080820	9082820	We've been stuck in that zoo for too long.
9082820	9084820	Well, try and swim across, dear.
9086820	9088820	Okay.
9090820	9092820	Hmm?
9098820	9102820	Wake up, everyone. The tiger's all leaving.
9102820	9104820	I'm glad he didn't grow.
9108820	9112820	I knew they wouldn't be mean enough to eat us after saving him.
9112820	9115820	Shall we jump in and swim back as well? It's not far.
9115820	9118820	Oh, yes. I'll go first.
9118820	9120820	I want to go first.
9120820	9123820	Darling, are you all right? Be careful, Moomin.
9123820	9125820	Look over there.
9130820	9131820	Crocodiles.
9131820	9135820	Oh, hurry up, Moomin. Swim around the back and come up the ladder.
9146820	9149820	How can there be crocodiles in the sea?
9149820	9151820	I thought they only lived in fresh water.
9151820	9153820	How are we going to get back to the shore now?
9153820	9156820	We'll have to wait for a boat to come past.
9156820	9159820	No, I'm afraid we'll have to think of something else, Mama.
9159820	9163820	We could have been waiting for a wink or so for that to happen.
9163820	9165820	A whole week!
9165820	9169820	But we'll starve. All they'll find is our bones bleached, waiting to sun.
9169820	9173820	Don't worry, little mind. Papa will think of something you'll see.
9173820	9175820	Good morning.
9176820	9179820	Snuffkin, what are you leaving?
9179820	9183820	I was going to go sea fishing, but I changed my mind.
9183820	9186820	I didn't fancy landing a sea monster.
9190820	9196820	Help! Someone help! Help anybody!
9196820	9198820	That's Mr. Hemmulin.
9198820	9201820	Oh, the tigers must be after him quickly.
9211820	9213820	Who had ever made you so cross?
9213820	9216820	I just told you not to eat my plants.
9217820	9220820	Please, someone help!
9224820	9226820	Let me in!
9234820	9236820	That fella's always been clumsy.
9236820	9238820	We can't really help him.
9238820	9240820	No.
9241820	9242820	Oh!
9245820	9247820	Are you alright, Hemmulin?
9247820	9249820	Oh, dear, I think so.
9249820	9251820	What about you?
9251820	9254820	What do you do when a rhino gets stuck in your brando?
9254820	9256820	This is a new one on me.
9256820	9258820	So I'm loose. I can't think of any other way.
9258820	9260820	You have to be very careful, though.
9260820	9262820	I think you're right.
9262820	9264820	Yes, thank you.
9271820	9273820	Ah, look where you're going.
9273820	9276820	It was you who brought all the animals in, wasn't it?
9276820	9278820	Yes, you're right. That's what you wanted.
9278820	9280820	It's a jungle now. I did a good job.
9280820	9283820	Oh, really? Well, they're not wild animals at all.
9283820	9285820	They're quite friendly.
9285820	9287820	Friendly?
9301820	9303820	Hmm.
9308820	9309820	See what I mean?
9309820	9310820	They make very good pets.
9310820	9312820	Cute, aren't they?
9320820	9323820	Snake! Go stick where are you?
9325820	9326820	Why do you want?
9326820	9329820	The rhino and the tigers have become pets of the movement family.
9329820	9332820	You're not going to let that happen to you.
9332820	9333820	Well, are you?
9333820	9334820	It's not.
9334820	9336820	I'll bring snorked maiden and movement here tonight.
9336820	9338820	There's no need to eat all of them.
9338820	9341820	Just bite off their tails, all right?
9341820	9343820	Okay.
9345820	9347820	You'll be really amazed like I was.
9347820	9350820	It's big enough for both of you to sit on.
9350820	9352820	How lovely. A giant water lily.
9352820	9356820	I wonder if the seeds came from that box you all found.
9356820	9358820	Oh, I can't wait to see it.
9359820	9361820	Looking at the size of the jungle,
9361820	9364820	there must have been an awful lot of seeds in that box.
9364820	9367820	I suppose the wind could have blown them anywhere.
9369820	9371820	Where's the giant water lily?
9371820	9373820	Let's see now.
9373820	9375820	Over there.
9381820	9383820	How wonderful.
9383820	9386820	You see, I wish you'd learn to trust me.
9386820	9389820	It's a very honest guy.
9389820	9392820	It's so soft and pink and beautiful.
9398820	9401820	How romantic to be on a boat made from a flower.
9401820	9403820	This is unbelievable.
9403820	9406820	Our old box seems to have grown into a tropical swamp.
9406820	9408820	It's a lot nicer.
9408820	9410820	Hey, stinky.
9410820	9412820	Stinky?
9412820	9415820	Oh, I can't see him anywhere.
9417820	9420820	I wonder how far we'll float.
9420820	9422820	It's getting dark, moment.
9433820	9435820	Gotcha.
9435820	9437820	We must get away.
9437820	9439820	I don't know yet.
9439820	9441820	Look, there's the seed.
9441820	9443820	Put the crooked aisles.
9443820	9445820	Over there, snorkemaid.
9445820	9446820	I suppose.
9446820	9450820	Well, it's the only way we'll get away from this monster.
9468820	9470820	Keep going, snorkmaid.
9470820	9472820	We're almost there.
9473820	9475820	Wait.
9475820	9479820	Moomin and snorkmaid kept swimming as fast as they could.
9479820	9481820	They had a head start on the snake,
9481820	9483820	but now he was catching up.
9483820	9486820	Even though movements are very good swimmers,
9486820	9489820	unfortunately for them, so are snakes.
9492820	9494820	They love the laughter,
9494820	9498820	and they love the living the movements.
9499820	9506820	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
9506820	9510820	They're always happy and always at play.
9510820	9514820	The movements are having fun day after day.
9514820	9517820	The movements.
9517820	9521820	The movements.
9521820	9523820	They love the laughter,
9523820	9527820	and they love the living the movements.
9528820	9535820	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
9535820	9539820	They're always happy and always at play.
9539820	9543820	The movements are having fun day after day.
9543820	9546820	The movements.
9546820	9550820	The movements.
9550820	9556820	The movements.
9558820	9563820	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
9589820	9593820	They are the movements.
9593820	9596820	So come with me, give me your hand.
9596820	9599820	I'll take you up to a moment land.
9599820	9602820	You can fly just like a bird.
9602820	9604820	Sing that song ever.
9604820	9607820	There were the movements.
9607820	9610820	There were the movements.
9610820	9613820	There were the movements.
9613820	9616820	There were the movements.
9616820	9621820	There were the movements.
9646820	9651820	There were the movements.
9651820	9656820	There were the movements.
9656820	9664820	There were the movements.
9664820	9667820	Move in.
9667820	9669820	Where are you moving?
9669820	9672820	It's not made in.
9672820	9675820	The rhino and the tigers that stinky set free from the zoo
9675820	9678820	are now living in the jungle that has grown up around movement house
9678820	9684820	and have settled into the restful life of movement valley.
9684820	9686820	Hey, have you seen movement?
9686820	9689820	No, you haven't seen him all evening.
9689820	9693820	I wonder where they got to.
9693820	9696820	Meanwhile, movement and snort made and chased by the snake
9696820	9701820	are swimming as fast as they can out to sea.
9701820	9703820	I can't swim another.
9703820	9707820	Snort must snort made and you must.
9707820	9714820	Hey, hey you there.
9714820	9717820	Come on, snort made and nearly there.
9717820	9719820	Look, there's a couple of hippos.
9719820	9720820	They're coming towards us.
9720820	9721820	We better get them on board.
9721820	9722820	That's funny.
9722820	9726820	I haven't heard about any hippos reported missing from the zoo lately.
9726820	9736820	Just a bit further snort made it.
9736820	9738820	We made it.
9738820	9742820	I didn't know hippos could climb so well.
9742820	9744820	Oh, thank you so much.
9744820	9746820	There was a huge snake chasing us.
9746820	9749820	Yes, we saw you were lucky we came along when we did.
9749820	9750820	Thank you for your help.
9750820	9752820	Whose ship is this?
9752820	9753820	ours.
9753820	9754820	We're from the zoo.
9754820	9757820	Oh, you've got one of the crocodiles.
9757820	9760820	Yes, and a lot of trouble he gave us as well.
9760820	9762820	There's another one around here somewhere.
9762820	9763820	We saw them.
9763820	9766820	Yes, we know there is, but we haven't been able to find him yet.
9766820	9770820	Oh boy, I wish they'd come as quietly as you hippos did.
9770820	9771820	Hippos.
9771820	9772820	Hippos.
9772820	9773820	Hippos.
9773820	9774820	Which zoo are you from?
9774820	9776820	I bet they'd pay well to get you back.
9776820	9777820	Now, look here.
9777820	9779820	I'm a woman, not a hippo.
9779820	9781820	Are you saying that I look like a hippo?
9781820	9784820	Well, perhaps they don't look exactly like a hippo.
9784820	9787820	No, but they're close enough, Captain.
9787820	9790820	I'm sure they've escaped from the zoo somewhere, though.
9790820	9791820	Yes, sir.
9791820	9793820	We haven't escaped from anywhere.
9793820	9794820	Certainly not a zoo.
9794820	9795820	We live in Moomin Valley.
9795820	9796820	We're Moomin's.
9796820	9797820	It's all right, Snork Maiden.
9797820	9799820	I'll not be taken for a hippo.
9799820	9801820	Come on, let's run for it.
9801820	9802820	Hey, wait.
9802820	9804820	There's a nice cozy cage already for you.
9804820	9806820	Hurry, Snork Maiden.
9806820	9807820	Ask to them.
9807820	9808820	Stop them now.
9808820	9810820	Don't let them get away.
9811820	9813820	Where are we going, Moomin?
9813820	9814820	Now, let's see.
9817820	9819820	Quickly, man, lower the live boat.
9819820	9822820	If they're not going to put us in any zoo.
9826820	9828820	Why did you come back?
9828820	9830820	I thought you were on the boat.
9830820	9831820	Oh, no.
9831820	9832820	Don't worry.
9832820	9834820	I never eat anything when I'm not swimming.
9834820	9835820	Are you sure?
9835820	9836820	I'm sure.
9836820	9838820	Now where's this ship?
9839820	9841820	Oh, they're catching up with us.
9841820	9843820	They want to put us in a cage and take us to the zoo.
9843820	9845820	Me too, I expect.
9845820	9847820	They're always trying to get me.
9847820	9848820	They've got one of the crocodiles.
9848820	9849820	Oh, did they?
9849820	9850820	They were my friends.
9850820	9851820	Right.
9851820	9852820	Hang on to me, you two.
9852820	9855820	I'm certainly not going back to any zoo.
9855820	9856820	Never, let's go.
9858820	9859820	Oh, no.
9859820	9860820	Now hold on tight.
9862820	9863820	Come back.
9863820	9864820	You horrible ripper.
9864820	9865820	Come back.
9869820	9871820	The moment's been caught by a big snake.
9871820	9874820	Yes, mama snorked maiden as well.
9874820	9876820	Dear stinky, that's not true, is it?
9876820	9879820	I wish people wouldn't realize that I almost never lie.
9879820	9882820	I'm sorry about them, but I thought I'd better tell you.
9882820	9885820	Oh, there aren't any snakes that big in movement valley.
9885820	9887820	There are tigers here, aren't there?
9887820	9889820	Well, there's big snakes too.
9889820	9891820	You brought the snake here, didn't you?
9891820	9894820	Papa, I'm not saying that I believe him.
9894820	9897820	But I think we'd better look for them just to be on the safe side, don't you?
9898820	9899820	Okay, don't believe me.
9899820	9901820	I've told you so my conscience is clear.
9901820	9904820	Where exactly did the snake attack them, stinky?
9904820	9906820	Down in the swamp by the sea.
9906820	9907820	Let's go, mama.
9908820	9909820	I'll come with you.
9909820	9913820	No, you'd better stay little my until movement where we've gone if he comes back.
9913820	9916820	He'll only worry if there's no one here.
9916820	9918820	And stinky, you'll show us where to go.
9918820	9919820	Okay.
9920820	9922820	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
9922820	9924820	Oh, I'll move.
9924820	9925820	Hey, you!
9925820	9927820	Have you eaten, movement, and snork made it?
9927820	9929820	It's all right, mama. We're here.
9929820	9931820	Oh, praise the boobie-goobie-goobie-goobie-goobie-goobie-goobie.
9931820	9933820	Me time, you friend.
9933820	9935820	You're a very big friend.
9935820	9938820	Please come in as much of you as you like.
9938820	9940820	Stinky just told us that you and Snork's are here.
9940820	9942820	Hey, you, I'm here.
9942820	9943820	Hey, you, I'm here.
9943820	9944820	Hey, you, I'm here.
9944820	9945820	Hey, you, I'm here.
9945820	9946820	Hey, you, I'm here.
9946820	9947820	Hey, you, I'm here.
9947820	9949820	Stinky just told us that you and Snork made it
9949820	9951820	been caught by a big snake, so we...
9951820	9953820	Where are you going, Stinky?
9953820	9956820	She did chase us at first.
9956820	9958820	Then we managed to get on a boat, but they wanted
9958820	9959820	to put us in a cage.
9959820	9961820	So we jumped back in the sea, met the snake again.
9961820	9963820	Then they tried to catch her too.
9963820	9965820	So she helped us to get away, and now she's our friend.
9965820	9967820	Who are they?
9967820	9968820	Men from the zoo.
9968820	9971820	They've come to recapture all the animals and take them away
9971820	9974820	from the jungle and put them in cages again.
9974820	9975820	Nice.
9975820	9977820	Secondly, don't want to go back to the zoo.
9977820	9980820	Papa, we've got to protect our friends.
9980820	9981820	Yes, we have.
9981820	9984820	I'm sure that the tigers and that nice rhino don't want to
9984820	9985820	go back even.
9985820	9987820	Oh, of course they don't.
9987820	9989820	They want to be free and live in our jungle.
9989820	9991820	Why don't you go and explore it?
9991820	9993820	I'm sure it'll be just like home.
9993820	9995820	And if you see the zoo people, you can come back here,
9995820	9997820	can't you?
9997820	9999820	I'm sure you'll like it here, Mrs. Snake.
9999820	10001820	Yes, I'm sure I will.
10001820	10003820	Come on, I'll show you the jungle.
10004820	10010820	I'm so relieved that you're both all right at home.
10010820	10014820	So are we, Mama, but there's something we haven't told you.
10014820	10017820	Yes, they thought we were hippopotamuses.
10017820	10018820	What?
10018820	10019820	Who did?
10019820	10021820	They need their eyes, Destiny.
10021820	10023820	The men from the zoo.
10023820	10025820	They thought we had escaped from another zoo,
10025820	10028820	and we're trying to catch us, and they nearly succeeded.
10028820	10029820	How rude.
10029820	10032820	We're not at all like hippos, the cheek of it.
10032820	10035820	So these men were only trying to capture our new friends,
10035820	10037820	but you and Snork Maiden as well.
10037820	10039820	And me and Papa if they'd known about us.
10039820	10040820	That's right, Mama.
10040820	10041820	They're idiots.
10041820	10044820	Hippopotamuses don't wear aprons or right memoirs.
10044820	10046820	That's really made me angry.
10046820	10050820	I bet they never faced the wrath of a movement Papa before.
10050820	10055820	I want to see you wrap yourself round and choke somebody.
10055820	10057820	I know. How about the tiger?
10057820	10058820	He do.
10058820	10059820	I'd rather not.
10059820	10061820	We became friends in the zoo.
10063820	10064820	Oh, I know.
10064820	10066820	Choke stinky. That'll be much better.
10066820	10069820	Yes, my dewey did let us out of the zoo.
10072820	10074820	Well, you're a great disappointment to me.
10074820	10076820	I let you out because I thought you'd attack the movements,
10076820	10078820	but you have tea with them instead.
10078820	10080820	You're pathetic, you know that?
10080820	10082820	I'm sorry, but we were brought up in captivity,
10082820	10084820	and we never had to hunt for our food.
10084820	10087820	All our meals are brought to us, you see.
10087820	10090820	But your tigers, what do you eat them?
10090820	10093820	Well, we love cat food.
10093820	10094820	Cat food.
10094820	10097820	Oh, I don't believe it.
10097820	10101820	Yes, it's easy to chew and it leaves our fur all sleep and shiny.
10101820	10104820	We like the yellow tins with the black cat, don't we, honey?
10104820	10105820	Yes, it's our favorite.
10105820	10108820	You wouldn't happen to have any on you, would you?
10118820	10119820	Mama!
10119820	10121820	Papa, quickly!
10122820	10123820	They're here.
10123820	10124820	The zoo men are here.
10124820	10128820	Oh, get all the animals into the house first, you.
10128820	10130820	Hurry, moment.
10130820	10131820	Okay, Papa.
10134820	10137820	The zoo men have come to get you.
10137820	10138820	Oh, I know.
10138820	10139820	I know.
10139820	10140820	I know.
10140820	10141820	I know.
10141820	10142820	I know.
10142820	10143820	I know.
10143820	10144820	I know.
10145820	10147820	The zoo men have come to get you.
10147820	10150820	Hurry, you'll be safe in the moment house.
10150820	10152820	Quick as you can, Rhino.
10152820	10153820	Into the house.
10153820	10154820	Go on.
10159820	10161820	Now, Rhino, push him.
10161820	10162820	I'm sorry.
10175820	10180820	Um, I don't think that's a good place to hide, Mrs. Snake.
10183820	10186820	I'm afraid that doesn't look quite right, Tiger.
10186820	10189820	I thought I might just look like a thick rug.
10189820	10192820	I'll just lie here like a beautiful porcelain ornament.
10192820	10195820	They'll never know we're here, darling.
10195820	10199820	Well, they'd never expect to find a Rhino under there.
10199820	10200820	That's what I thought.
10200820	10201820	Where are they?
10202820	10203820	Well, where are they?
10203820	10206820	They can't just have vanished into thin air.
10208820	10209820	Hmm.
10209820	10210820	Look, up there.
10212820	10213820	In the chimney.
10218820	10220820	So they're in there, are they?
10232820	10233820	Papa!
10235820	10236820	They've seen the snake.
10236820	10237820	They're nearly here.
10240820	10243820	Now, I want you to calm down and be quiet, everyone.
10243820	10245820	We won't let them take you away.
10245820	10248820	I promise you they'll have a fight on the ends if they try.
10248820	10250820	Teeth, please, my father.
10250820	10251820	Of course, dear.
10262820	10263820	Hello.
10265820	10266820	Hello.
10268820	10269820	Hello.
10269820	10270820	Hello.
10277820	10279820	Hello, having a picnic, are you?
10279820	10280820	It's lovely day for you.
10280820	10281820	Not at all.
10281820	10283820	We're all here from the zoo, sir.
10283820	10285820	Oh, are you on some sort of expedition?
10285820	10288820	Excuse me, but are you the owner of this house?
10288820	10289820	Yes, indeed.
10289820	10290820	I am.
10290820	10291820	I'm moving, Papa.
10291820	10292820	Well, what can I do for you?
10292820	10295820	Well, you could send out the animals hiding in your house.
10295820	10297820	That'll do for a start.
10297820	10298820	Animals?
10298820	10299820	Oh, no.
10299820	10302820	We have firm believers that they belong outside.
10302820	10306820	Sir, you can't see from where you are, but I can assure you that there is a python
10306820	10308820	sticking its head out of your chimney.
10308820	10309820	A python?
10309820	10311820	Yes, that's right.
10311820	10313820	No, it isn't.
10313820	10314820	It isn't.
10314820	10316820	No, it's my daughter.
10316820	10318820	She happens to look like a python.
10318820	10320820	Not all the time you understand.
10320820	10321820	Right.
10321820	10322820	Come on, man.
10322820	10324820	We'll go and get the zoo's property.
10324820	10327820	No, you will not enter my house.
10327820	10328820	All right.
10328820	10329820	Well, you let the animals out.
10329820	10330820	We won't have to.
10330820	10331820	It's up to you, sir.
10331820	10334820	There are no animals, and you won't enter my house.
10334820	10335820	Now, wait a minute.
10335820	10336820	I do believe, yes.
10336820	10339820	You're one of those hippos, aren't you?
10339820	10340820	I am not.
10340820	10341820	I'm moving, Papa.
10341820	10343820	And I am the owner of this house.
10343820	10344820	No, you're not.
10344820	10345820	You're a hippopotamus.
10345820	10346820	Yeah.
10346820	10348820	A hippo who owns a house.
10348820	10350820	And it's also running in an illegal zoo.
10350820	10351820	Break down the doors.
10351820	10352820	Huh.
10352820	10354820	That is against the law.
10354820	10355820	Oh, it is, isn't it?
10355820	10357820	Well, there's a nice cage winning for you as well.
10357820	10359820	A woman, Papa, hippo.
10359820	10361820	I warn you, if you touch that door,
10361820	10362820	you'll regret it.
10362820	10363820	Go, yeah?
10365820	10366820	Great boys.
10366820	10367820	Let's go in.
10367820	10368820	Charge.
10368820	10369820	Charge.
10369820	10370820	Charge!
10390320	10392820	hall.
10392820	10394820	Now, then, what's going on?
10394820	10397820	Little mice brought the inspector.
10397820	10399820	What do you mean that you're doing?
10399820	10402700	Ah, they're hiding animals from the zoo in this house.
10402700	10403700	We want them back.
10403700	10406460	I tried to reason with the hippo, but it was no good.
10406460	10410460	Oh, have you know that's willful destruction of property, my good man?
10410460	10412460	It's not willful, we're from the zoo.
10412460	10413860	We gotta get in somehow.
10413860	10417860	Oh, have you, and can you be sure that there are zoo animals in there?
10418860	10420860	You just take a look up there at the chimney.
10420860	10422180	That's all I'm sure.
10422180	10423180	Go on.
10425060	10427060	See that python's head sticking out?
10428340	10429260	That's on.
10429260	10431260	I can't see a python's head.
10431260	10433780	But there was a python's head up there, I saw it.
10435580	10436580	I can't breathe.
10438580	10440580	Now you listen to me, zoo man.
10441580	10444620	Either you stop bothering my friends or I'll arrest you.
10444620	10445460	Is that clear?
10445460	10446740	Well, is it?
10446740	10447740	Yes, sir, it is.
10447740	10449980	But what about the zoo animals?
10449980	10452460	You heard the inspector now go away.
10452460	10453300	Do you see that?
10453300	10454100	See what?
10454100	10454980	The hippopotamus.
10454980	10455740	What?
10455740	10456740	The hippopotamus.
10456740	10459100	He's a fellow's been hiding all our zoo animals.
10459100	10461540	We got a nice cage lined up for him as well, inspector.
10461540	10463500	Oh, so that's your plan, isn't it?
10463500	10465220	Ha, they want to take them all.
10465220	10468140	Moomin, snork, me, mama, and papa.
10468140	10470060	Hmm, the criminal conspiracy.
10470060	10471140	Conspiracy?
10471140	10473620	It would probably be called kidnapping.
10473620	10475660	Once you can't kidnap a hippo.
10475660	10477660	That's a movement.
10477660	10479580	It could be white slavery, though.
10479580	10483220	I'm sure I could add incitement to riot to the list.
10483220	10485380	Now I hate paperwork, so I'll tell you one.
10485420	10487900	If you're gone within 10 minutes, I won't arrest you.
10487900	10490460	Why don't you put them in the deepest dungeon, inspector?
10490460	10492820	The one with all the rats and spiders and scorpions
10492820	10495100	that'll teach them to put Moomin's encages.
10495100	10496820	That's a good idea, little mind.
10496820	10499260	They like animals.
10499260	10501780	I'll start counting now.
10501780	10505020	One, two, three.
10505020	10508460	Get around men quickly.
10508460	10510140	We'll have to think quickly on this one, men.
10510140	10512780	Come on, now, does anybody have any smart ideas?
10512780	10514460	Come on, we're running out of time.
10516380	10517660	One minute.
10517660	10519980	Look, guys, we're going to figure something out right now.
10519980	10520820	Ready and look.
10520820	10524060	One minute, 30 seconds.
10524060	10525060	Two minutes.
10525060	10526900	Three minutes, 30 seconds.
10526900	10528100	Look, leave us alone.
10528100	10529420	Way of work and faring.
10529420	10532220	All right, six minutes and 50 seconds.
10532220	10533260	Time's up.
10533260	10534300	You're cheating.
10534300	10538180	The police don't cheat, and now you've got nine minutes
10538180	10539700	and 30 seconds.
10539700	10540740	How about that?
10540740	10542100	Nine minutes, 50 bucks?
10542100	10543060	I give up.
10543060	10544500	Everybody beat it.
10544500	10546100	But we're still discussing it.
10546100	10546700	No, we're not.
10546700	10548100	We're getting out.
10548100	10548940	Look, everyone.
10548940	10552220	The zoom in, and we're running off.
10552220	10553340	Great.
10553340	10555460	You've got to come and see this, Mama.
10555460	10558060	Nine minutes and 50 and a half seconds.
10558060	10559140	And don't come back.
10559140	10560860	We'll be the dungeon for you.
10560860	10563460	And I make that 10 minutes up to you.
10563460	10565060	You saved this little mind.
10565060	10567540	It was really clever of you to fetch the inspector.
10567540	10570340	Well, there were too many of them for me to fight.
10570340	10571020	OK?
10571020	10572940	Everyone, come on now.
10575460	10579220	Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
10579220	10581180	And so everyone was saved.
10581180	10583180	And eventually, they all came out of the house
10583180	10585620	to go and have fun in the jungle again.
10585620	10587220	As long as the warm weather lasted,
10587220	10588660	there were plenty of things to do.
10588660	10591460	But one day, the weather changed.
10591460	10593620	And cold winds blew down Mumen Valley.
10596620	10599300	It feels like autumn has arrived.
10599300	10601500	The jungle won't like the cold weather.
10601500	10604140	Do you think it will die, Mama?
10604140	10605940	I'm afraid it will, little mind.
10605940	10607380	It grew very quickly.
10607380	10611420	So perhaps it will go the same way.
10611420	10612660	And it did.
10612660	10616060	The whole jungle with it and died in just one night.
10622300	10624340	I think I've done a cold coming, Mama.
10624340	10625180	I'm sorry.
10625180	10626820	I can't get the house any hotter.
10626820	10627820	I missed the zoo.
10627820	10629340	At least it was warm now.
10629340	10631740	Yes, this cold is awful.
10631740	10634180	It would warm them up if we weren't the dead jungle.
10651260	10652460	Now they're happy again.
10652460	10653460	But for how long?
10661740	10668740	Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys.
10668740	10669740	It's cold again.
10669740	10671740	It was warm in our cages.
10671740	10673740	What are you afraid here?
10673740	10675740	Yes, free to have pneumonia.
10675740	10680740	I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spending the winter here.
10680740	10682740	And so all the animals,
10682740	10684740	decided to return to the zoo.
10684740	10688740	Perhaps we'll let you come back next summer, Mrs. Snake?
10688740	10689740	I like that.
10689740	10690740	When it's warmer.
10694740	10697740	Hey, look, the animals are on their way back.
10697740	10699740	Oh, Ray!
10699740	10700740	That wonderful.
10700740	10702740	Oh, it's good to see you.
10702740	10703740	You're welcome.
10703740	10704740	I'm so excited.
10704740	10705740	I'm so excited.
10705740	10706740	I'm so excited.
10706740	10707740	I'm so excited.
10707740	10708740	I'm so excited.
10708740	10709740	I'm so excited.
10709740	10710740	I'm so excited.
10710740	10712740	Oh, it's good to see you.
10712740	10714740	You don't know how much we missed you.
10714740	10715740	Oh, good.
10715740	10716740	Gosh.
10716740	10718740	We'll come back right now, old fella.
10718740	10719740	It's good to see you.
10719740	10720740	Come on now.
10720740	10721740	Get back to your cages quickly.
10721740	10723740	We've been keeping them nice and warm for you.
10723740	10725740	Go on, off you go now.
10725740	10728740	You look all right, but I'm sure you must all be starving.
10728740	10731740	We'll do you a special meal tonight, all right?
10731740	10733740	Ah, the hippos, too.
10733740	10735740	For the last time, we're moments.
10735740	10736740	Not hippos.
10736740	10737740	You must be cold as well.
10737740	10739740	We'll warm up a cage for you.
10739740	10740740	It'll be nice and cozy, there.
10740740	10741740	No.
10741740	10742740	No.
10742740	10744740	It just came to send the animals off.
10744740	10746740	Hey, get a cage ready for the hippos.
10746740	10747740	Will you?
10747740	10748740	Nice and warm.
10748740	10751740	At the risk of sounding repetitive, we are moments.
10751740	10752740	Don't be ridiculous.
10752740	10754740	You're mullet here.
10754740	10756740	But we're nothing like hippos.
10756740	10758740	We know you're not purebred, but the public
10758740	10760740	will never be able to tell.
10760740	10767740	Do we have to stay here forever, Papa?
10767740	10769740	Of course not, Momen.
10769740	10771740	Don't worry. I'll think of something.
10771740	10772740	You will, won't you?
10772740	10774740	Have you got any ideas?
10774740	10778740	Well, not yet, but I am a writer, you know.
10782740	10784740	Don't cry, Snorth Maiden.
10784740	10786740	I'm sure there won't be only hay to eat.
10786740	10789740	I don't mind as long as we're together.
10789740	10792740	But what if they put us in separate cages?
10792740	10793740	No.
10793740	10796740	Well, that would be awful if they wouldn't do that.
10796740	10800740	Well, perhaps the inspector will come looking for us.
10800740	10803740	When he realizes that we've gone as well as the animals,
10803740	10806740	he'll bring the full power of the Lord to bear on them.
10806740	10808740	Oh, look, there's someone coming.
10808740	10809740	It's Snorth Maiden.
10809740	10810740	And Hamilton.
10810740	10811740	And a little Mai.
10811740	10813740	Snorth Maiden.
10815740	10816740	Hi, Moomin.
10817740	10820740	Don't worry. We'll have you guys out in just a minute.
10823740	10824740	Please come out.
10827740	10830740	Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to let you out.
10830740	10832740	I'm in charge of this zoo.
10832740	10834740	I'm afraid it was quite an understandable mistake.
10834740	10838740	But please accept this token of apology from the Board of Trustees.
10838740	10840740	Here you are, madam.
10840740	10843740	Mr. Hemelon and I went to the Royal Academy of Science
10843740	10845740	just to sort all this out.
10845740	10847740	We've been given a letter from the President
10847740	10849740	stating that you are not hippos.
10849740	10852740	Mr. Hemelon's scientific background helped persuade him.
10852740	10854740	So you can all come home now.
10855740	10859740	Well, it just goes to show you must never judge by appearances alone.
10862740	10863740	Mama.
10863740	10864740	Yes, Papa.
10864740	10866740	Do you think I should grow a beard?
10866740	10868740	No, Papa.
10875740	10878740	And so autumn came to Moomin Valley.
10878740	10882740	A new season with different weather and different pleasures.
10889740	10896740	They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.
10896740	10903740	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
10903740	10907740	They're always happy and always at play.
10907740	10910740	The movements are having fun day after day.
10910740	10914740	The movements.
10914740	10918740	The movements.
10918740	10925740	They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.
10925740	10932740	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
10932740	10936740	They're always happy and always at play.
10936740	10940740	The movements are having fun day after day.
10940740	10944740	The movements.
10944740	10947740	The movements.
10947740	10954740	The movements.
10962740	10973740	The movements.
10973740	10976740	Here they are for one and all.
10976740	10979740	The movements are about to come.
10979740	10982740	Come on and sit down here with me.
10982740	10987740	There for you on your TV they are the movements.
10987740	10990740	They are the movements.
10990740	10993740	If so come with me give me your hand.
10993740	10996740	I'll take you up to Moomin Land.
10996740	10999740	You can fly just like a bird.
10999740	11001740	Sing that song ever.
11001740	11004740	There were the movements.
11004740	11007740	There were the movements.
11007740	11010740	There were the movements.
11010740	11013740	There were the movements.
11013740	11016740	There were the movements.
11016740	11019740	There were the movements.
11019740	11022740	There were the movements.
11022740	11025740	There were the movements.
11025740	11028740	There were the movements.
11028740	11031740	There were the movements.
11031740	11034740	There were the movements.
11034740	11037740	There were the movements.
11037740	11041740	There were the movements.
11041740	11045740	There were the movements.
11045740	11054740	There were the movements.
11054740	11062740	Fall has come to Moomin Valley and the memory of sunshine filled hours fades as the days become shorter and the nights longer.
11062740	11068740	The wind blows away the falling leaves and the blue skies of summer are now gray and cloudy.
11068740	11072740	Winter is just around the corner.
11072740	11078740	Snork made it.
11078740	11080740	Where are you going?
11080740	11083740	Oh I'm just taking my brother his lunch little my.
11083740	11086740	He must have nearly finished the flying ship by now.
11086740	11087740	Oh no.
11087740	11090740	Not even snork works that quickly.
11090740	11092740	Well have you seen it?
11092740	11093740	No I haven't.
11093740	11095740	He won't even let me come into his workshop.
11095740	11098740	Is he afraid it'll disappear if someone sees it?
11098740	11102740	He hasn't said why but I suppose all great inventors have to be very careful.
11102740	11105740	Someone might want to steal their ideas.
11105740	11108740	Moomin told me he's dying to have a look at it.
11118740	11120740	Hey Moomin open the door.
11120740	11122740	I've got my hands full.
11122740	11124740	Come on quickly.
11124740	11126740	Look what I've got.
11126740	11129740	It's a 100 player.
11138740	11140740	Do you think you can get it working dear?
11140740	11142740	Oh yes of course mom.
11142740	11145740	Why do people always give me things that are broken.
11145740	11150740	It'd be nice to have something that worked for a change.
11150740	11153740	Moomin Papa will get it working for you.
11153740	11156740	My auntie said that the record was alright though.
11156740	11157740	It's dance music.
11157740	11159740	She's had it for ages but I've never heard it.
11159740	11160740	Oh that's nice.
11160740	11164740	It's years since I danced but it seems like only yesterday.
11164740	11166740	Do you remember what funny was Papa?
11166740	11168740	Dancing.
11168740	11169740	Oh yeah.
11169740	11171740	I see.
11171740	11173740	Have you fixed it Papa?
11174740	11175740	Huh?
11175740	11177740	I can hear music.
11177740	11179740	Doesn't sound like snuffkin.
11204740	11207740	Right have you got the idea now?
11207740	11209740	Yes I think so.
11209740	11211740	Me too.
11211740	11212740	Come on.
11212740	11215740	Oh let's see you then.
11215740	11217740	May I?
11217740	11221740	Did I do it?
11221740	11223740	Oh wow.
11224740	11226740	Look at Papa Moomin.
11226740	11229740	He's a great dancer.
11253740	11255740	Well then can you dance snuff?
11255740	11256740	I've never tried.
11256740	11259740	Right well try now.
11284740	11292740	Oh that was fun.
11292740	11295740	Oh dancing never you still wear me out like this.
11295740	11298740	You've got no sense of rhythm at all Sniff.
11298740	11301740	I can still dance though can I?
11301740	11303740	Oh are you ready Papa?
11303740	11306740	I think I'll have to sit this one out Mama.
11306740	11308740	Alright.
11309740	11311740	Little one.
11311740	11312740	No thank you.
11312740	11313740	I'll dance on my own.
11313740	11314740	Well then.
11314740	11316740	Why don't you dance with me and Sniff?
11316740	11318740	Ah.
11332740	11335740	Oh it looks like it's here for the day.
11339740	11344740	Oh what horrible weather Snuffkin.
11344740	11345740	Yes.
11345740	11347740	They're having fun.
11347740	11351740	Well Sniff brought this old record player over and we've been dancing.
11351740	11353740	I haven't done it for years and years.
11353740	11355740	Well aren't you coming in?
11355740	11359740	I can smell winter in the air Moomin Papa.
11359740	11364740	Oh yes you're right.
11369740	11373740	Sniffkin why?
11378740	11380740	Sniffkin come and dance with me.
11380740	11382740	No thanks of mine.
11387740	11389740	Sorry.
11389740	11391740	I'm sorry.
11391740	11393740	Oh you.
11399740	11403740	Hmm what's the matter with this?
11406740	11408740	I'm afraid it's broken.
11408740	11410740	Just when we were having so much fun.
11410740	11412740	Will you be able to fix it again dear?
11412740	11414740	No even I can't mend it now.
11414740	11417740	Oh please try Papa will you?
11417740	11421740	Snuffkin do you know anything about record players?
11421740	11423740	No I'm afraid not.
11423740	11424740	Oh dear.
11424740	11425740	But what?
11425740	11429740	I'll play my harmonic if you want to continue to dance and then you can fiddle around with the machine.
11429740	11431740	How would that be?
11431740	11434740	Oh yes please that would be great Snuffkin thanks.
11434740	11437740	Now then what would be a good tune to dance to?
11437740	11439740	Let's see.
11456740	11459740	Oh no.
11470740	11472740	Now what's this?
11472740	11476740	Oh no I give up.
11478740	11481740	May I?
11485740	11488740	You're thinking about going away again aren't you Snuffkin?
11488740	11490740	Hmm.
11490740	11496740	I know that you go south every year when winter comes but I'll still miss you though and I wish you could stay here in Moomin Valley.
11496740	11499740	I know Moomin.
11500740	11502740	Who are they?
11502740	11505740	How do you know I expect to be?
11505740	11506740	I don't know.
11506740	11509740	I'm just a little bit nervous.
11509740	11512740	I'm just a little nervous.
11512740	11517740	You're thinking about going away again aren't you Snuffkin?
11517740	11519740	Hmm.
11519740	11525740	I know that you go south every year when winter comes, but I'll still miss you though and I wish you could stay here in Moomin Valley.
11525740	11528740	I know Moomin.
11528740	11530740	But I don't know I expect.
11530740	11534740	Probably the best place for them.
11534740	11536740	When are you leaving Snuffkin?
11536740	11538740	Oh I haven't decided yet.
11538740	11542740	So you'll be here for a bit longer then.
11542740	11544740	Do you know where you going?
11544740	11545740	No.
11545740	11547740	It must be fun traveling.
11547740	11550740	Yes most of the time.
11550740	11553740	It's the best way of meeting new people and still being on your own.
11553740	11559740	I wish we could do that, but even when we hibernate and go to sleep, we're never really alone.
11559740	11562740	I guess I'd hibernate too if I had to stay up here in Moomin.
11562740	11565740	During all the freezing winter snows.
11570740	11574740	Do you think I could go south with Snuffkin, Papa?
11577740	11581740	Not really, it's the moment way to hibernate.
11581740	11586740	It's a family custom passed down through the years by our ancestors.
11586740	11589740	But Papa, I don't want to go to sleep for months on end.
11589740	11591740	I want to travel south with Snuffkin.
11591740	11593740	Oh Moomin.
11593740	11596740	You promise you'll be back on the first day of spring.
11596740	11597740	Oh Mama.
11597740	11600740	Does that mean I can really go?
11600740	11602740	I can't wait to tell Snuffkin.
11602740	11604740	I can, can't I?
11604740	11607740	Well if you really want to, I don't suppose we'll stop you.
11607740	11609740	Will we Papa?
11609740	11615740	Now my parents didn't mind when I traveled around in my youth, so yes or right Moomin.
11615740	11619740	Oh thank you Mama, thank you Mama.
11619740	11623740	That's great, but what will Snuffkin say?
11629740	11634740	Well, it's a good idea, and I gotta say it'd be fun to have you a long Moomin.
11634740	11637740	So I can come with you Snuffkin?
11638740	11639740	No.
11639740	11640740	What?
11640740	11643740	I'm sorry, but I've got to go on my own.
11643740	11646740	Don't be disappointed Moomin, I told you I travel alone.
11646740	11647740	I need to.
11647740	11652740	After spending the rest of the year here, just as I need to be here, after spending the winter alone.
11652740	11655740	And the joy of returning to Moomin Valley is something I wouldn't miss.
11655740	11657740	Which Snuffkin, I thought.
11657740	11661740	The time will soon pass, and you'll be asleep through most of it.
11661740	11663740	You won't notice I'm not here.
11663740	11666740	I'll see you next spring, Moomin.
11666740	11671740	I'll be back on the first day as usual, I promise, as soon as the weather warns.
11671740	11675740	And when the flowers start to grow, nothing will keep me from Moomin Valley.
11676740	11680740	I'll be back on the first day.
11680740	11684740	I'm sorry, I didn't work out for you, Moomin.
11684740	11687740	Oh, it's all right.
11687740	11692740	Oh, come on Moomin, you'll have to tie them a bit tighter than that.
11692740	11696740	I'm sorry I didn't work out for you, Moomin.
11696740	11698740	Oh, it's all right.
11698740	11704740	Oh, come on, Mum, and you'll have to tie them a bit tighter than that.
11707740	11712740	It'll be a cold winter, so we'll need lots of wood to keep us going till spring comes.
11712740	11713740	I know.
11713740	11716740	Now you want to stay warm, don't you?
11716740	11719740	When I grow up, I'll go south for my own, too.
11719740	11722740	Yes, of course you will.
11728740	11732740	It's Mum and home.
11732740	11734740	Yes.
11734740	11737740	How is he? Is he still down in the dumps?
11737740	11741740	I'm afraid so, grandma's cheer you up recipe didn't work.
11741740	11745740	I think he's being silly just because Snuffkin's going away.
11745740	11747740	I suppose he is.
11747740	11749740	But don't worry, Mama.
11749740	11754740	He won't be miserable much longer because I got a surprise for him.
11780740	11782740	Are you there, Mum?
11782740	11784740	Oh, Mum, and don't cry.
11784740	11786740	Boys don't cry, I suppose.
11786740	11787740	Of course they do.
11787740	11789740	Well, I'm not crying, so they're...
11789740	11792740	All right, but I do think you should get up now.
11792740	11794740	Oh, and why should I?
11794740	11796740	I have a surprise for you.
11796740	11797740	I don't want any surprises.
11797740	11800740	Come on, I'm going to go and see Snuffkin his workshop.
11800740	11804740	But you know he won't let us in. I've tried before.
11804740	11806740	Oh, yes. He will today.
11806740	11808740	I promise.
11808740	11811740	What? You mean Snorkel shows his flying ship at last?
11811740	11813740	Yes, he said.
11813740	11815740	Has he really finished it then?
11815740	11818740	No, not yet. There's still a lot of work to do on it.
11818740	11820740	Then I wonder why he's letting us see it.
11820740	11822740	He's always refused before.
11822740	11824740	What's made him change his mind?
11824740	11826740	But I asked him this time.
11826740	11829740	I said I wanted to show it to you. It just needed a woman's touch.
11829740	11831740	What did you say to him?
11831740	11833740	First, he said absolutely not.
11833740	11837740	But when I told him how ill you were and that you probably wouldn't be with us much longer,
11837740	11839740	he gave in and said we could see it.
11839740	11840740	Just you and me of course.
11840740	11842740	I'm not that ill Snorkel maiden.
11842740	11843740	Oh good.
11843740	11846740	Because sometimes when people are very depressed and just lying bad,
11846740	11848740	they've done something bad.
11848740	11851740	Oh stop it Snorkel maiden. Don't say things like that.
11854740	11856740	I'm only trying to cheer you up.
11856740	11858740	So remember, don't tell us all.
11858740	11861740	No one else must know anything about it.
11861740	11862740	Okay.
11868740	11870740	Let's go.
11883740	11884740	No.
11887740	11888740	A little my.
11888740	11889740	Little my.
11889740	11890740	Trouble.
11890740	11891740	Big Trouble.
11891740	11892740	We must fool her.
11892740	11893740	Yes, but how?
11893740	11894740	What can we do?
11895740	11896740	I know what we'll do.
11897740	11898740	What?
11898740	11899740	Quick, Moonman.
11899740	11901740	You just agree with everything I say Snorkel maiden.
11901740	11902740	Oh.
11903740	11905740	I thought you were in bad Moonman.
11905740	11907740	No, we're going to see Snorkel.
11907740	11908740	Yes.
11908740	11909740	Really?
11909740	11911740	Yes, he needs to clear a runway for when the flying ship is finished.
11911740	11913740	We're going to help him do it, that's all.
11913740	11914740	Yes.
11914740	11915740	Are you really, Moonman?
11915740	11917740	You got out of bad to do that.
11917740	11924740	I'm afraid I find it very strange that Snorkel's asked to go along and help him cut down bushes and dig up roots and things.
11924740	11926740	You might have noticed I'm not a complete fool.
11926740	11927740	But it's true, little my.
11927740	11928740	Oh, yes.
11928740	11930740	Well, at least you could have invented a better lie.
11930740	11935740	You must think I'm pretty stupid to believe a pathetic story like that.
11935740	11936740	But it's the truth.
11936740	11938740	And we need your help.
11938740	11939740	Yeah.
11939740	11940740	Don't bother, don't bother.
11940740	11941740	I don't want to hear anymore.
11941740	11944740	I think it's very sad that you have to pretend.
11944740	11949740	You're trying to hide something from me and I'm not interested in what sort of sneaky underhanded thing it is.
11949740	11950740	But little my.
11950740	11951740	No buts.
11951740	11955740	And anyway, I'm a little too busy at the moment to take any notice of what's going on.
11955740	11956740	Goodbye.
11959740	11960740	Come on.
11961740	11962740	Phew, that was close.
11962740	11963740	Yeah.
11970740	11971740	Ha!
11971740	11972740	Think, thank you.
11972740	11973740	Keep a secret from me, do they?
11982740	11984740	Are you alone?
11984740	11985740	Of course we are.
11985740	11987740	I promised, didn't I?
11988740	11989740	Come in then.
11997740	11998740	Wow.
12005740	12007740	It's nearly ready, isn't it?
12007740	12009740	Oh no, there's a lot more to do.
12009740	12011740	The machine isn't half finished yet.
12011740	12016740	And as you can see, there's a lot to do on the ship itself, but I'm getting there slowly.
12018740	12021740	I never thought it would be so fantastic, smork.
12022740	12026740	Well, I suppose you could say the design wasn't a complete failure.
12027740	12030740	I'm quite sure it'll fly beautifully.
12030740	12031740	Oh, thank you.
12031740	12033740	Do you really think it will, woman?
12034740	12035740	I can see it now.
12035740	12039740	High up in the air, dodging in and out of the clouds, way up above the world.
12041740	12044740	Well, I'm glad to see that you're so perceptive and quite right.
12044740	12046740	Oh, how very thoughtful of me.
12046740	12048740	Shouldn't you sit down and rest.
12048740	12049740	You know, you're illness.
12049740	12051740	It doesn't help to get too excited.
12052740	12053740	Ha, I shouldn't worry, smork.
12053740	12055740	There's nothing wrong with him.
12057740	12059740	Oh, little my, how did you get in here?
12060740	12061740	Throw that door.
12061740	12063740	But I always keep it.
12063740	12065740	Oh, oh, oh, no.
12066740	12068740	I must have forgotten to lock it.
12069740	12071740	And it's a bit late to do it now, isn't it?
12071740	12075740	But don't worry, if I wanted to get in, I'd get in locks or no locks.
12075740	12077740	Oh, you lied to us, little my.
12077740	12080740	Of course, but so did you, telling me that stupid story.
12080740	12082740	Now we're even, right?
12082740	12084740	Now, listen, little my.
12084740	12087740	Don't ever tell anybody what you see over here.
12087740	12088740	All right.
12091740	12094740	This invention contains so many outstanding new features
12094740	12096740	it is difficult to know where to begin.
12098740	12102740	But let me start with the most exciting part of the whole construction.
12107740	12112740	It began as a dream or rather the concept of a dream
12112740	12117740	thrilling, beautiful, impossible, dangerous.
12129740	12130740	Oh.
12143740	12145740	Can you take the ship down, movement?
12145740	12147740	I'd like you to land at that side of the lake.
12147740	12149740	Oh, why do you want to get off?
12149740	12152740	Aren't you having fun flying about up here?
12153740	12155740	I want to be on my own.
12155740	12157740	Oh, please stay here.
12157740	12158740	If you want.
12158740	12160740	No, really, movement, please.
12160740	12162740	Bye now.
12162740	12163740	No!
12167740	12169740	Snuff me!
12173740	12174740	Ugh.
12174740	12177740	Oh, oh.
12188740	12190740	So long then, movement, my friend.
12190740	12192740	I'll see you again next year.
12192740	12194740	The first day of spring.
12218740	12220740	Goodbye, then, Snuffkin.
12241740	12243740	Off for the winter, eh, Snuffkin?
12243740	12244740	Yes.
12244740	12246740	Goodbye, Mr. Hemilan.
12246740	12248740	We'll be seeing you in the spring.
12248740	12251740	Yes, when the snows are gone.
12257740	12261740	Oh, to be young and follow the sun wherever it goes.
12261740	12262740	Oh.
12274740	12278740	And so the snow fell and winter came to movement valley.
12278740	12283740	And in movement's hearts, Snuffkin and the spring seemed a long, long way away.
12284740	12293740	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
12293740	12300740	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
12300740	12304740	They're always happy and always at play.
12304740	12311740	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
12311740	12318740	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
12318740	12326740	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
12326740	12331740	They're always happy and always at play.
12331740	12337740	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
12337740	12344740	The movements, the movements.
12344740	12351740	The movements.
12368740	12372740	Here they are for one and all.
12372740	12375740	The movements are about to come.
12375740	12378740	Come on and sit down here with me.
12378740	12380740	They're here for you on your TV.
12380740	12383740	They are the movements.
12383740	12386740	They are the movements.
12386740	12389740	So come with me, give me your hand.
12389740	12392740	I'll take you up to a movement land.
12392740	12395740	You can fly just like a bird.
12396740	12398740	Sing that song ever.
12398740	12401740	There were the movements.
12401740	12404740	There were the movements.
12404740	12407740	There were the movements.
12407740	12410740	There were the movements.
12410740	12413740	There were the movements.
12413740	12416740	There were the movements.
12425740	12428740	There were the movements.
12428740	12431740	There were the movements.
12431740	12434740	There were the movements.
12434740	12437740	There were the movements.
12437740	12439740	There were the movements.
12439740	12442740	There were the movements.
12442740	12445740	There were the movements.
12445740	12449740	There were the movements.
12456740	12461740	It's the middle of winter in Moomin Valley.
12461740	12464740	And all is quiet and peaceful in Moomin House.
12464740	12467740	Is everybody enjoys their winter slumber.
12467740	12470740	The house is full of dust covers.
12470740	12473740	On the chandelier, on the furniture, on everything.
12473740	12477740	Waiting until they all wake up again on the first day of spring.
12477740	12482740	And start to get everything in Moomin House clean and ready for the coming summer.
12482740	12485740	But what's this?
12485740	12489740	It looks like Moomin is restless as if something has disturbed him.
12489740	12492740	I wonder what he was dreaming about.
12495740	12498740	I wonder what he was dreaming about.
12498740	12501740	I wonder what he was dreaming about.
12505740	12509740	I wonder what he was dreaming about.
12509740	12516740	I wonder what time it is.
12516740	12520740	Oh, it's nearly 20 after two.
12520740	12523740	Wonder whether it's morning or afternoon.
12523740	12526740	It doesn't really matter, I suppose.
12526740	12532740	Oh, it's stopped.
12532740	12535740	Oh, it's frozen.
12535740	12542740	It looks really dark out there.
12552740	12559740	Mama, Mama, please wake up.
12560740	12562740	Papa, Papa.
12562740	12564740	Mama, Mama.
12564740	12566740	Mama, what's wrong with me?
12566740	12569740	I feel way too weak.
12569740	12576740	Oh.
12586740	12587740	It's very odd.
12587740	12592740	I don't usually wake up when I'm hibernating.
12593740	12599740	Oh, dear.
12599740	12606740	The whole house is buried in snow.
12606740	12613740	Oh.
12613740	12620740	Oh.
12621740	12627740	Oh.
12627740	12634740	Oh.
12634740	12639740	Oh.
12639740	12646740	Oh.
12646740	12653740	Oh.
12653740	12660740	Oh.
12660740	12665740	This doesn't look like Moomin Valley.
12665740	12674740	And it's so quiet.
12674740	12676740	What was that?
12676740	12679740	Perhaps I better go home.
12679740	12680740	No.
12680740	12681740	What's the matter with me?
12681740	12684740	Everyone's asleep and the furniture's all covered up.
12684740	12691740	And Moomin's don't give up.
12699740	12701740	I wish enough can we're here.
12702740	12708740	He's probably in the far south where it's warm and sunny.
12708740	12715740	I wonder what that is.
12739740	12745740	Oh.
12745740	12748740	Oh.
12748740	12750740	Oh.
12750740	12755740	That sounds like...
12755740	12760740	Oh, he has his little mind.
12760740	12763740	By the bobo, what are you doing here, Moomin?
12763740	12765740	What am I doing here?
12765740	12768740	I heard strange noises and came to see what it was.
12768740	12770740	Then you crashed into me like an avalanche.
12770740	12772740	And I've just lifted the box off you.
12772740	12774740	Oh, don't be stupid, Moomin.
12774740	12777740	I mean, why are you out in the snow and not hibernating like the others?
12777740	12779740	Spring's not for ages.
12779740	12780740	Oh, I don't know.
12780740	12783740	I just woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.
12783740	12785740	But what about you sliding about like that?
12785740	12787740	You should be asleep too.
12787740	12789740	Yes, I should, but I just woke up as well.
12789740	12790740	Probably to look after you.
12790740	12794740	I tried to wake my stupid sister, but she kept on snoring.
12794740	12796740	I think this snow is really great.
12796740	12797740	Well, I don't.
12797740	12802740	It's cold, it's slippy, much too bright, and it's everywhere and far too quiet.
12802740	12804740	I saw the grog.
12804740	12805740	Wow.
12805740	12808740	That horrible freezing monster.
12808740	12812740	She should feel at home in this, and there's no point in her trying to freeze anything.
12812740	12814740	I saw her on the hill.
12814740	12816740	Then it was her voice, I heard.
12816740	12821740	Yes, and the trouble with the horrid thing is that she's so cold I wouldn't even want to touch her, Moomin.
12821740	12822740	Huh?
12822740	12823740	It's her!
12823740	12824740	Oh.
12824740	12834740	I'm getting cold shivers all over.
12834740	12836740	Well, why don't you expect in the snow?
12836740	12838740	No, it's the grog's fault.
12838740	12839740	She's done it.
12839740	12841740	Look at my skin, it's all goose bumpy.
12841740	12845740	It's not like that in the summer, it's smooth, not lumpy.
12845740	12849740	It's not the snow that makes me feel so cold, it's her staring at me.
12849740	12858740	I'm scared.
12858740	12859740	That was great.
12859740	12860740	Good, isn't it?
12860740	12862740	You can have as much as you like.
12862740	12864740	We picked more raspberries than ever this year.
12864740	12866740	The Mama made lots of juice.
12866740	12867740	Thanks.
12867740	12869740	Oh.
12869740	12870740	Huh.
12870740	12873740	I want that.
12873740	12875740	Mama's silver tray?
12875740	12876740	Yeah.
12876740	12877740	What do you want it for?
12877740	12880740	To slide on the snow with a coarse stupid?
12880740	12882740	But it's a sort of family treasure in heirloom.
12882740	12885740	Well, you never use it and it's so shiny.
12885740	12895740	It'll make a great sled and go really fast.
12895740	12897740	Doesn't look like they'll wake up till spring.
12897740	12899740	They're lucky, they're still sleeping.
12899740	12905740	I think it's very unfair that I woke up like this.
12905740	12907740	So, what should we do now?
12907740	12909740	I want to go look at the sea.
12909740	12910740	Good idea.
12910740	12913740	At least that won't be covered in snow.
12925740	12929740	I bet the great cold was just like this.
12932740	12933740	Oh no!
12933740	12934740	What's the matter?
12934740	12935740	I forgot the tray.
12935740	12936740	Never mind.
12936740	12938740	You can use it as a boat anyway.
12938740	12939740	It would sink.
12939740	12940740	Yes, you could.
12940740	12941740	What?
12941740	12942740	How?
12942740	12943740	Oh look!
12943740	12944740	There's the sink!
12950740	12952740	But it's all frozen.
12952740	12954740	So we'll be able to slide on it.
12955740	12957740	What's that over there?
12965740	12966740	Huh?
12985740	12986740	Huh?
12986740	12988740	Tootiki!
12988740	12990740	Hello, you too.
12991740	12993740	You're not hibernating either?
12993740	12995740	Oh no.
12995740	12997740	I haven't got time to spend four months sleeping.
12997740	12998740	Why not?
12998740	13001740	Little Mayan, I just woke up and now we don't know what to do.
13001740	13003740	I'm sure you can think of something.
13003740	13004740	Who's supposed to?
13004740	13007740	I've never seen the sea frozen before.
13007740	13009740	Did you make that horse tootiki?
13009740	13010740	Yes, I did.
13010740	13011740	Can I sit on it?
13011740	13012740	No, you can't.
13012740	13014740	I need it for the lady of the cold.
13014740	13016740	Oh, I see.
13016740	13018740	I suppose you've heard of her.
13018740	13020740	Yes, she's very beautiful,
13020740	13021740	but if she looks into your eyes,
13021740	13022740	you're turned into a block of ice.
13022740	13024740	She's not a very nice lady.
13024740	13025740	That's right, Little Mayan.
13025740	13027740	Spring can never come while she's here.
13027740	13029740	It waits for her to go.
13029740	13030740	Oh, I see.
13030740	13033740	And are you hoping she'll ride away on this horse then?
13034740	13036740	Yes, and it will take her back to the north,
13036740	13039740	where she stays until she comes here again next winter
13039740	13041740	and drives the sun away.
13041740	13044740	The horse doesn't look very solid to me, Tootiki.
13044740	13046740	Well, that's why I'm going to pour water over it
13046740	13049740	when it gets really cold, and then it'll be solid.
13050740	13052740	When is the lady of the cold coming?
13052740	13055740	You can never tell, but soon, tonight, perhaps,
13055740	13058740	it feels much colder already.
13059740	13060740	My.
13075740	13077740	What's happened to the sun, Tootiki?
13077740	13079740	Do you know when the sun will come back again?
13080740	13081740	Uh-huh.
13081740	13083740	It's in the south shining on Snuffkin,
13083740	13084740	but it'll be back soon,
13084740	13087740	and then it will stay a bit longer each day.
13087740	13093240	Good I can't wait, now there'll be a full moon tonight, and we'll be able to see everything.
13093240	13096740	Great, I can get my tray out! I can't wait to try it on the sea!
13096740	13098740	What do you mean, your tray?
13098740	13103740	Well, let's move in, Mama's tray, but I'm using it. I'm going to put a sail on it and slide across the ice.
13103740	13105740	Why not wait till tomorrow?
13105740	13109740	Wait until tomorrow? No, when I want to do something, I do it now!
13109740	13112740	What if the ice suddenly melts or something?
13113740	13114740	Eh!
13115740	13116740	Yeah!
13117740	13122740	I like it here, it's warm and cozy. I hope Moomin Papa doesn't mind me using it.
13122740	13128740	This is Papa's bathhouse. He build it himself, and he'd be very glad to know you're using it.
13128740	13131740	It's great, the window paints are different colors.
13131740	13136740	If you look out through one, the world is red, and through another one, the world is green.
13142740	13150740	Oh, you don't hibernate either, do you?
13150740	13155740	Now scram, the horrible lady of the cold is coming and if she looks you in the eye, you'll turn to ice!
13155740	13157740	Go on, go away!
13173740	13175740	Moomin!
13175740	13177740	Tu-tiki!
13177740	13179740	Moomin!
13180740	13181740	Moomin!
13181740	13183740	Tu-tiki, why are you?
13183740	13185740	Little Mike, we're over here.
13185740	13186740	Huh?
13187740	13189740	Why are you doing down there?
13189740	13192740	Tu-tiki's trying to catch some fish.
13192740	13195740	If she does, she's going to cook us some dinner.
13195740	13198740	Right, I've got to get sailing, man.
13198740	13201740	I'd better go see what she's doing to Mama Silver tray.
13201740	13203740	Okay.
13206740	13208740	Ah, got one.
13213740	13215740	Oh dear, me.
13218740	13221740	She's cold and wet under that ice.
13221740	13222740	How are you doing, little Mike?
13222740	13224740	Very well, thank you.
13226740	13228740	How can you get under the ice anyway?
13228740	13231740	I guess the water must be low and there's a gap left there.
13231740	13232740	Oh, how?
13232740	13237740	I don't know, but perhaps the tide was in when the sea froze and some of it got stuck to the shore.
13237740	13240740	Oh, I suppose it's possible.
13240740	13245740	Tu-tiki told me that she has fish soup every day in the wintertime.
13248740	13251740	I know, I'll go see if the horse is frozen yet.
13251740	13254740	Make sure you shut the door behind you.
13254740	13256740	Oh, my thumb!
13259740	13261740	Hmm, I don't think it's hard enough yet.
13261740	13264740	It'll collapse if the lady if the coke gets on it now.
13267740	13270740	Oh, it's getting colder and colder.
13271740	13273740	Oh, it's getting colder and colder.
13274740	13276740	Oh, it's getting colder and colder.
13298740	13299740	The grog.
13304740	13306740	Don't tell me you want to ride the horse.
13309740	13311740	I don't think you'd better.
13312740	13314740	This is for the lady of the cold, you know.
13317740	13319740	There's no telling what she'd do to you.
13319740	13321740	Look you in the eye, probably.
13334740	13336740	Even the grog is frightened of the lady of the cold.
13339740	13341740	Ah, now it looks frozen.
13345740	13346740	Wee!
13348740	13349740	Wee!
13357740	13359740	Great, isn't it, movement?
13359740	13361740	Yeah, that old tree really moves.
13361740	13362740	Wanna go?
13362740	13363740	No thanks, I'm too big.
13363740	13364740	Come on, now.
13364740	13367740	The fish soup is ready and it's time you were inside, little my.
13367740	13369740	Keep it warm for me, I'm having another go.
13369740	13371740	No, little my.
13371740	13372740	Why not?
13372740	13376740	Have you forgotten what I told you the lady of the cold may be coming?
13376740	13377740	Oh.
13377740	13379740	Well, I want to see her.
13379740	13380740	I'm not scared of her.
13380740	13382740	I'll be moving so fast she won't get a chance.
13382740	13385740	No, now listen to me, little my.
13385740	13388740	All you have to do is not let her look you in the eye.
13388740	13391740	But what happens if you're not quick enough and she catches you before you turn away?
13392740	13396740	I know, if we watch her from the bathhouse, she won't see us.
13400740	13401740	Please, little my.
13401740	13403740	Come in, she's almost here.
13403740	13405740	We can watch it from inside.
13409740	13410740	That's no good.
13410740	13411740	I want to see her properly.
13411740	13412740	No, little my.
13412740	13413740	No, little my.
13413740	13414740	Don't go.
13416740	13417740	No!
13419740	13420740	Come back.
13420740	13421740	Little my.
13424740	13425740	Oh dear.
13425740	13428740	Come on, let's get back in the cabin before it's too late.
13428740	13429740	Wee!
13443740	13445740	Oh, the lady of the cold.
13446740	13448740	Come on.
13472740	13473740	I saw her face.
13474740	13475740	I saw her face.
13475740	13477740	I saw her and she didn't turn away to eye.
13480740	13482740	Press little my to get away with it.
13482740	13484740	I don't know how she does it.
13485740	13487740	I think her nerves are made of steel.
13487740	13489740	I hope she's alright.
13489740	13492740	She should try not to make so much noise out there.
13504740	13505740	Oh dear.
13510740	13513740	Oh dear.
13525740	13528740	Oh dear.
13534740	13536740	Oh dear.
13540740	13541740	Yay!
13541740	13542740	I saw her face.
13542740	13544740	I saw her face.
13552740	13554740	Come on.
13560740	13562740	Come on, my friend.
13562740	13564740	Oh no, don't stop now.
13564740	13565740	No, my friend.
13565740	13566740	Oh, this is it.
13569740	13570740	Little my.
13580740	13586740	Oh dear.
13592740	13594740	Oh dear.
13618740	13620740	Little my.
13623740	13625740	Come on, please.
13628740	13630740	Wake up, please.
13634740	13637740	Oh please, don't stay frozen, little my.
13637740	13638740	Don't worry, little my.
13638740	13639740	We'll thought you out.
13639740	13640740	Don't worry.
13640740	13642740	It's nice and warm here.
13653740	13655740	Oh, that's hot, moment.
13655740	13657740	Praise the ball, Bob.
13657740	13659740	You come back.
13661740	13665740	So little my came back from the cold, little the worst for wear.
13665740	13667740	Moment need not have worried.
13667740	13671740	For the little mysars world are practically indestructible.
13683740	13690740	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
13690740	13697740	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
13697740	13701740	They're always happy and always at play.
13701740	13705740	The movements are having fun day after day.
13705740	13708740	The movements.
13709740	13712740	The movements.
13712740	13719740	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
13719740	13727740	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
13727740	13731740	They're always happy and always at play.
13731740	13734740	The movements are having fun day after day.
13734740	13738740	The movements.
13738740	13741740	The movements.
13741740	13748740	The movements.
13765740	13770740	Here they are for one and all.
13770740	13773740	The movements are about to come.
13773740	13776740	Come on and sit down here with me.
13776740	13778740	They're here for you on your TV.
13778740	13781740	They are the movements.
13781740	13784740	They are the movements.
13784740	13787740	So come with me, give me your hand.
13787740	13790740	I'll take you up to a movement land.
13790740	13793740	You can fly just like a bird.
13793740	13796740	You sing the path song ever.
13796740	13798740	There were the movements.
13798740	13801740	There were the movements.
13801740	13804740	They were the movements.
13804740	13807740	There were the movements.
13807740	13810740	There were the movements.
13810740	13813740	They were the movements.
13823740	13853740	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
13853740	13883740	During the long winter in Moomin Valley, almost everybody living their hibernates until the sunshine comes again in the spring. But for some reason, Moomin and Little Mai woke up in the middle of it and couldn't get back to sleep.
13883740	13913740	But for some reason, Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin
13913740	13929540	That was fun! Why don't you have a go Moomin? I'm probably a bit heavy for it. So get something else, dummy! I might later... Anyway, I thought we were gonna see Tuttaki. Come on, I'll pull you. Okay!
13934220	13940800	I know why you don't wanna go Moomin. You're scared of sliding down from the top, aren't you? No, of course I'm not!
13943740	13952740	Don't you think he's not here? I wonder where she's gone to.
13952740	13955740	That's her over there, isn't it?
13955740	13957740	Oh, yeah, I think it is.
13957740	13961740	Jane, move in. She looks like she's sliding.
13961740	13962740	Sliding?
13962740	13965740	Yes, it's obvious. She's sliding, of course.
13965740	13969740	She's coming over.
13969740	13972740	What were you doing out there, too, Tiki?
13972740	13978740	Stung go down. It's the only place you can see it from. I just caught it for it disappeared over the horizon.
13978740	13979740	Where did it go to?
13979740	13983740	It comes up again in the south and will probably shine on snuffkin.
13983740	13986740	Hey, Tiki, what are those things you got on your feet?
13986740	13991740	They're called skates and they're the best thing possible for moving across the ice quickly.
13991740	13994740	Just what I need. Come on. Show me how to do it.
13994740	13998740	Yes, okay?
13998740	14002740	That's great. I'm going to make myself some skates, too.
14002740	14005740	It's not as easy as you'd think, little lie.
14005740	14011740	Pathetic. All you need is a sword and knife on your shoes and that sounds easy enough to me.
14014740	14021740	You know, it's strange, but I've got a funny kind of feeling that there's someone else apart from us in the bathhouse.
14021740	14022740	Hmm, well, there it is.
14022740	14025740	Who is it? Where are they?
14026740	14028740	Little lie, you can't see them.
14028740	14032740	Huh, what do you mean I can't see them? Where are they hiding in the cupboard?
14032740	14036740	No, they're invisible. Look, I'll show you.
14042740	14044740	Oh, oh, there's something on my head.
14044740	14048740	See, that's two of the shoe mice. They're eight of them all together.
14048740	14051740	Now, don't walk a little lie.
14052740	14056740	I didn't see any shoe mice here in the summer.
14056740	14059740	Although, if they're invisible, I wouldn't have done.
14059740	14061740	No, probably not.
14061740	14065740	As in the summer when we come across new little animals that we've never seen before.
14065740	14069740	And who likes snuffkin, go away when the wind and snow comes.
14069740	14074740	Then when the days are shorter and everyone else is hibernating, they come out.
14074740	14077740	And summer's so shy, they're invisible, dear.
14077740	14080740	I'm afraid I don't understand winter at all.
14080740	14085740	Well, of course you don't. You moments have always slept through and don't know very much about it.
14085740	14090740	Oh, I can't wait to tell Mum or Papa about all this. They'll be really amazed.
14096740	14097740	Moomin!
14097740	14098740	What is it?
14098740	14101740	We will wake up tomorrow, won't we, Moomin?
14101740	14103740	I'm sure we will. Why?
14103740	14106740	I just don't want to go on sleeping and sleeping until spring.
14106740	14108740	Well, we woke up today, so...
14108740	14110740	But we don't know about tomorrow.
14110740	14113740	No, of course not. We'll have to wait and see.
14113740	14117740	If we're awake, we'll know. And if we're asleep, then it doesn't matter.
14117740	14118740	Hmm.
14118740	14122740	Well, if I'm not awake and you are, wake me up, okay, Moomin?
14122740	14124740	Yes, all right. Go to sleep now.
14124740	14126740	What if it's the other way around, Moomin?
14126740	14130740	Well, what if I wake up and you're still fast asleep?
14130740	14134740	I don't mind sleeping all winter. Now, stop talking to me, my.
14135740	14137740	You'd better wake me up or else.
14161740	14163740	Hey, little mine.
14163740	14165740	Where have you gone to?
14176740	14177740	Hello.
14177740	14180740	Well, well. Wonderful place for skiing, you've got here.
14180740	14183740	What are those funny things on your feet?
14184740	14186740	Hey, what? You're joking.
14186740	14187740	Huh?
14187740	14189740	You mean you really don't know what these are?
14189740	14191740	That's why I'm asking you.
14191740	14194740	Well, they're skis, didn't you see me come down?
14194740	14198740	Yes, I did. Can you slide on the ice with these and go just as fast?
14198740	14201740	Oh no, on ice, you have to use skates.
14201740	14203740	What is that, young lady?
14203740	14207740	Oh, it's a snowboard. You slide on the snow with it.
14217740	14220740	That's not bad, but it's only your silver tray, isn't it?
14220740	14221740	That's right, mister.
14221740	14222740	I'll teach you to ski.
14222740	14224740	No, thank you. I'll learn by watching you.
14224740	14226740	Won't take me long at all.
14226740	14228740	I'm afraid skiing is not that easy, young lady.
14228740	14230740	Don't worry, it won't be for me.
14230740	14233740	Everything is once I decide to do it.
14240740	14243740	Oh, so you spend all year going where the snow is?
14243740	14245740	That must be tiring.
14245740	14247740	Not at all. Life should be a struggle.
14248740	14250740	This jam is really good.
14250740	14254740	Does it always have to be winter, catch a struggle in spring and summer instead?
14254740	14256740	Well, no, that would be too easy.
14256740	14258740	You could just sit back and relax.
14258740	14262740	No, you've got to face up to the cold and exercise to keep warm.
14262740	14265740	That sounds very interesting, Mr. Brisk.
14265740	14271740	One clear cold bath a day keeps all those unnecessary thoughts away.
14271740	14273740	My own little poem.
14273740	14276740	What? You don't mean you swim in this weather, do you?
14276740	14278740	The water must be very close to freezing.
14278740	14282740	Well, the sea is a lot colder than that. It is frozen.
14282740	14283740	Is there a river?
14283740	14287740	Yes, there is, but the water looks very, very cold.
14287740	14289740	Sounds just right.
14289740	14294740	Have you got any more of this wonderful jam? It's delicious.
14294740	14298740	There's some more in the cellar, but we've got cranberry up here if you'd like that.
14298740	14301740	No, thanks. This will do for now.
14301740	14304740	I'd appreciate some after my daily swim.
14304740	14306740	It'll work up an appetite.
14312740	14314740	This is great.
14316740	14319740	I can hardly watch. It makes me shiver all over.
14319740	14321740	Is everybody like you where you come from?
14321740	14324740	Unfortunately not. Why did you join me?
14324740	14326740	No, thank you.
14327740	14331740	Hello, what are you two looking at?
14331740	14332740	Huh?
14333740	14338740	Oh, hello there, little dog. We're watching that madman down there.
14343740	14345740	He looks like he's swimming.
14345740	14347740	Moving valley is full of very odd people.
14347740	14350740	He's not from moving valley as a matter of fact.
14350740	14352740	Who are you?
14352740	14355740	I'm sorry, and I'm looking for my brothers.
14355740	14358740	I don't suppose you've seen them, have you?
14358740	14360740	Your brothers, have you lost them?
14360740	14363740	Are they hibernating somewhere, do you think?
14363740	14366740	Oh, no, not them. They never do that.
14366740	14371740	Well, everyone else in moving valley is hibernating, except little Mai here.
14371740	14376740	Now, too ticky, and the invisible mice, me, oh, and that crazy person down in the middle.
14377740	14379740	Oh, yeah!
14383740	14387740	My brothers are up in the lonely mountains. Is that far from here?
14387740	14389740	No, not far.
14389740	14394740	Lonely mountains. I know there are wolves up there, but I never heard of any dogs.
14394740	14398740	Well wolves and dogs are brothers, didn't you know?
14398740	14406740	Oh, you know, this tastes even better after an invigorating swim.
14406740	14409740	That's my favorite jam, much nicer than cranberry.
14409740	14412740	Oh, I agree.
14412740	14416740	Ah, doggie, now don't you want your jam?
14416740	14418740	What? No, you have it.
14418740	14420740	Oh, thank you.
14420740	14423740	Oh, you look as though you're a bit worried about something.
14423740	14425740	Yes, I suppose I am.
14426740	14429740	Put it out of your mind.
14429740	14434740	Why do you think your brothers are wolves? Did someone tell you they were?
14434740	14437740	Of course they are. Everyone knows that.
14437740	14439740	And besides, I can feel the wolf in me.
14439740	14443740	Well, you might feel it, but nobody can see it for a star. Wolves are much bigger than you.
14443740	14448740	I want to go and find them, and then we can all hell at the moon. I've been practicing.
14448740	14451740	I can see why he wants to be a wolf, but we'd better keep him here.
14451740	14454740	He could get hurt if he goes up there on his own.
14454740	14457740	You don't really want to live with wolves, do you?
14457740	14459740	Oh, I do very much.
14459740	14461740	Why don't you travel around with me, sorry, you?
14461740	14464740	I've got little dogs. They could be your brothers and sisters if you want.
14464740	14466740	Well, I don't know.
14466740	14470740	Look, I'm going to stay here in Moomin Valley for a while, and we can become great friends.
14470740	14472740	You're going to stay here?
14472740	14478740	Oh, yes. Marvelous slopes find swimming the most wonderful jam, and I'll build myself an igloo.
14478740	14480740	An igloo? You mean a house made of snow?
14480740	14487740	Yes, that's it, exactly. If it's all right with you, Moomin, I'll take this jam with me, just to keep me going.
14505740	14508740	Hello there. Can I borrow your spade for a minute, Mr. Brisk?
14508740	14510740	Of course. What for, my friend?
14510740	14512740	I want to break up this barrel.
14512740	14515740	Oh, that's easy. Allow me, little mind.
14515740	14518740	Here, here, here.
14518740	14520740	How's that, young lady?
14525740	14529740	Mr. Brisk really loves this jam. He can't stop eating it.
14529740	14533740	Well, it's very nice, Moomin. I can't imagine anyone not liking it.
14533740	14535740	Do you know how to ski to a tiki?
14535740	14539740	Well, of course I do. I just haven't done it yet.
14539740	14542740	Mr. Brisk says that he's going to teach me.
14542740	14543740	Oh.
14545740	14548740	I can't move my legs tied up like this.
14548740	14552740	That's the whole point. You don't have to. You just move your skis. Easy as winking.
14558740	14561740	First of all, you have to learn how to fall properly.
14561740	14564740	Well, then if I learn to ski first, then I won't fall.
14570740	14572740	Little mind has skis, too.
14572740	14574740	Oh, they're just made from an old barrel.
14574740	14576740	Yours are much more sophisticated.
14576740	14580740	Now then, Benjamin, ease and lean forward. Are you ready?
14580740	14583740	I don't think I like this. It's too steep.
14583740	14585740	Can I practice on something a bit flatter?
14585740	14589740	Well, maybe next time. Now then, I'll have few rolls.
14589740	14591740	Whoa!
14593740	14594740	Whoa!
14602740	14605740	Trying to start an avalanche movement?
14605740	14608740	You know, I think this hill is even steeper than the last one.
14608740	14611740	There's nothing to worry about. You've already mastered falling down.
14611740	14612740	How if you go again?
14612740	14614740	Whoa!
14614740	14616740	Whoa!
14616740	14618740	Whoa!
14618740	14620740	Whoa!
14620740	14622740	Whoa!
14622740	14624740	Oh, stop it, please!
14624740	14627740	You can do it yourself. Just calm down.
14627740	14629740	Whoa!
14629740	14631740	Whoa!
14631740	14633740	Whoa!
14633740	14636740	Oh, look at that marvelous you need!
14636740	14640740	Please, someone, stop it, please!
14640740	14642740	Whoa!
14643740	14646740	That was terrific moment. Let's do it again!
14646740	14648740	Whoa!
14656740	14658740	What are you looking at, sorry you?
14658740	14660740	I can hear all my brothers howling out there.
14660740	14662740	They're probably hungry and looking for food.
14662740	14665740	No, I know they're calling me.
14665740	14669740	I'm going to see them. I've really got to a moment.
14672740	14674740	Whoa!
14680740	14682740	Oh.
14683740	14685740	Got anything?
14685740	14687740	No, not yet.
14687740	14690740	I'm afraid there's going to be trouble. We're running out of jam.
14690740	14692740	Mr. Bresch, I suppose.
14692740	14694740	You can't stop eating it.
14694740	14696740	Well, you have to ask him to leave.
14696740	14698740	I can't do that.
14698740	14702740	Of course you can. It's your home and you can choose who you have.
14712740	14715740	A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.
14715740	14718740	Usually a sign that spring is not far away.
14729740	14732740	A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.
14732740	14734740	I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.
14734740	14736740	I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.
14736740	14738740	I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.
14738740	14740740	I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.
14740740	14742740	I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.
14742740	14744740	I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.
14744740	14746740	I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.
14746740	14748740	I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.
14748740	14750740	I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.
14750740	14752740	I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.
14752740	14754740	I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.
14755740	14757740	I'm afraid.
14770740	14772740	Hello, woman!
14772740	14774740	Oh, hello, Mr. Bresch!
14774740	14776740	I'm sorry, but all the jams gone.
14776740	14778740	It's just an empty jar.
14778740	14780740	Oh, well, never mind.
14780740	14782740	It was a great jam.
14782740	14787140	things on my mind. You see, now that spring is here, I have to leave, Moomin Valley.
14789220	14790500	Oh, do you?
14792660	14796980	It's sad, but there you are. I have to go. Goodbye, Moomin.
14796980	14798420	Goodbye, then, Mr. Bursk.
14799140	14809620	Keep some jam for me.
14812740	14840740	Hello, I'm sorry. I'm your brother. I've wanted to be with you for a long, long time. I'm afraid I'm not very brave or strong, but if you'd let me stay with you...
14842740	14844420	Oh, don't you know me?
14846420	14851620	Looks like I was wrong. Oh, well, go on. Eat me if you want to.
14859460	14865300	It's a pity I didn't sleep at night instead of learning to how Moomin was right. I shouldn't have come.
14872740	14902740	I'm sorry, Moomin, I'm sorry, I didn't sleep at night, I'm sorry, I didn't sleep at night, I'm sorry, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I
14902740	14932740	didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night
14932740	14962740	I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep
14962740	14992740	I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night
14992740	15004340	but it's always time to rest, it's always time to rest, and it's always time to rest, and it's always time to rest, and it's always time to rest, me
15005080	15007280	Look, a little boy, Hang on to me
15008240	15011500	Thank you, Moonman! Let's go!
15020920	15022360	It's alright Moonman, don't panic. I'm with you. You're okay!
15022740	15024740	Oh, oh!
15025740	15027740	Over there, moving! Quick, do!
15029740	15031740	See, if you knew what I'd tell you,
15031740	15033740	there's nothing to be afraid of.
15033740	15035740	Just trust me, moving. I'm always right, aren't I?
15035740	15037740	Yes, I know you are, little my,
15037740	15039740	but we'd still better hurry.
15042740	15045740	Come on, you two, just a bit further!
15045740	15046740	Come on!
15051740	15053740	No!
15053740	15054740	Wow!
15055740	15057740	Oh, it's cold in here.
15057740	15061740	Quickly, let's get inside and light a fire, you'll soon warm up!
15065740	15066740	Phew!
15066740	15076740	And so Mr. Brisk and the ice both left human valley,
15076740	15081740	and spring returned once more after a long and eventful winter.
15083740	15089740	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements,
15089740	15096740	believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
15096740	15100740	They're always happy and always at play,
15100740	15111740	the movements are having fun day after day, the movements, the movements,
15111740	15118740	they loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements,
15118740	15125740	believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
15125740	15130740	They're always happy and always at play,
15130740	15137740	the movements are having fun day after day, the movements,
15137740	15147740	the movements, the movements.
15147740	15172740	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come,
15172740	15175740	come on and sit down here with me,
15175740	15180740	therefore you aren't your TV, they are the movements,
15180740	15183740	they are the movements,
15183740	15186740	so come with me, give me your hand,
15186740	15189740	I'll take you up to a moment land,
15189740	15192740	you can fly just like a bird,
15192740	15197740	sing that song ever, there were the movements,
15198740	15209740	there were the movements, there were the movements,
15209740	15213740	there were the movements.
15227740	15257740	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
15257740	15287740	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba It's spring again in Moomin Valley, And after their long winter hybrination, everyone is awake and enjoying the sunshine and the flowers. Everyone that is accept for Moomin was in bed with a terrible cold.
15287740	15299420	Oh dear, moment, that's a nasty cough.
15299420	15302180	My throat is very sore.
15302180	15303260	This will help soothe it.
15303260	15306700	It's one of grandma's best potions.
15306700	15310500	It's hard.
15310500	15311500	Never mind.
15311500	15314500	Nice tasting medicines don't always work as well.
15315500	15319340	I wanted to go out, it's spring.
15319340	15323500	I know dear, but you'd catch pneumonia or something.
15323500	15329500	Mama, does anyone know why snuffkin hasn't come back yet?
15329500	15337500	No, perhaps spring came earlier this year and he wasn't ready.
15337500	15343140	Snuffkin had always come back to Moonman Valley on the very first day of spring.
15343140	15349140	But not this year.
15349140	15357140	Snuffkin.
15357140	15358140	Hi, moment, Papa.
15358140	15359140	Is moment any better?
15359140	15361140	No, I'm afraid not.
15361140	15362140	He's still got a nasty cough.
15362140	15364140	Can I go up and see him?
15364140	15365140	No, you'd better not.
15365140	15371140	You might catch it.
15372140	15374140	You know how poorly you get when you're ill.
15374140	15375140	It's best not to take the risk.
15375140	15378140	I should think he'll be up and about before very long.
15378140	15381140	Yes, it's better to be safe than sorry.
15381140	15385140	Moment shouldn't have gone out in the winter, should he, Mama?
15385140	15387140	No, but he couldn't go back to sleep.
15387140	15390140	Snow would have that effect on anyone.
15390140	15394140	I knew little Mai was out in the cold with him and look at her.
15394140	15398140	She seems healthy enough.
15398140	15400140	I'll take these flowers to Moonman later.
15400140	15410140	Little Mai's too small to catch a cold.
15410140	15412140	This is boring.
15412140	15415140	I can't believe that Moonman's sick.
15415140	15418140	And Snuffkin's not back either.
15418140	15420140	I sure wonder what's happened to him.
15420140	15424140	I bet you moment gets better as soon as Snuffkin arrives in Moonman Valley.
15424140	15428140	He's never been this late coming back before.
15428140	15431140	Perhaps he's got fed up with you guys.
15431140	15433140	Impossible. He's very fond of me.
15433140	15435140	He's told me so lots of times.
15435140	15438140	He likes Moonman too, of course.
15438140	15441140	He might have been captured by a highwayman.
15441140	15443140	Let's go and look for him.
15443140	15445140	A highwayman?
15445140	15446140	First Snuffkin, silly.
15446140	15448140	He's got to come back so Moonman will get better.
15448140	15450140	We must find him.
15450140	15452140	But where do we look, Snork Maiden?
15452140	15453140	In the south.
15453140	15455140	It's a big place. He could be anywhere.
15455140	15458140	Well, I don't care how big it is I'm going anyway.
15458140	15459140	You're being silly.
15459140	15460140	No, I'm not.
15460140	15462140	I don't think your brother will like it.
15462140	15464140	In fact, I know he won't.
15464140	15466140	Have you gone completely bananas?
15466140	15468140	No, I haven't.
15468140	15470140	And you'll just have to make your own muffins.
15470140	15472140	There's more to food than muffins.
15472140	15474140	I was speaking figuratively.
15474140	15476140	Anyway, I'm going, dear brother.
15476140	15479140	And nothing you can do or say will stop me.
15479140	15480140	It's for Moonman.
15480140	15482140	That's a sort of hair brain scheme
15482140	15484140	that could only have been dreamed up by you.
15484140	15485140	What good will it do?
15485140	15487140	You don't even know where he is.
15487140	15490140	It is not. Moonman is pining for Snuffkin.
15490140	15491140	Rubbish.
15491140	15493140	Men don't pine for their friends.
15493140	15495140	If he isn't back yet, then he isn't coming.
15495140	15498140	And if he isn't going to come, what's the point of looking for him?
15498140	15500140	You won't find him anyway.
15502140	15505140	He will come when he knows that Moonman is sick.
15505140	15507140	Black mails just like a sister.
15507140	15510140	Something done for love could never be blackmail.
15510140	15512140	Oh no, you're not going and that's fine.
15512140	15515140	Look, why don't you and Little My go by yourselves?
15515140	15518140	Oh, well, I didn't really make a definite decision.
15518140	15520140	I just sort of said that I might come along.
15520140	15523140	But if Snort Maiden isn't going, then there doesn't seem any point.
15523140	15524140	Does there?
15524140	15527140	And I'm not going because I think it's stupid and hair brain too.
15527140	15529140	Snuffkin will come back soon.
15529140	15530140	Not Snort Maiden.
15530140	15531140	What do you say to that?
15539140	15541140	How is Moonman feeling any better?
15541140	15544140	He's asleep now, but the cough doesn't seem so bad.
15544140	15545140	And his temperature?
15545140	15546140	Still quite high.
15572140	15573140	Snuffkin!
15592140	15594140	Am I pleased to see you, Moonman?
15594140	15596140	You look like you needed a lift.
15596140	15600140	This magic cloud must be one of those we got from the Hobgoblin's top hat.
15601140	15603140	That's right. I had one of them away.
15603140	15606140	What a good idea, Moonman. You are clever.
15606140	15609140	Well, it was so much fun the last time, wasn't it?
15609140	15610140	Hi, Moonman!
15610140	15611140	Hi!
15611140	15613140	Oh, look, Snuffkin.
15613140	15615140	I didn't know they were here, too.
15620140	15621140	Snuffkin!
15625140	15627140	Moments!
15627140	15628140	Snuffkin!
15631140	15632140	Oh!
15638140	15640140	Not just a dream.
15640140	15641140	Snuffkin!
15648140	15650140	You look blousy, Moonman.
15650140	15653140	Oh, thanks, stinky. You'd better keep away.
15653140	15655140	There's no need bugs and things like that.
15655140	15656140	Stay away from me.
15656140	15658140	They're probably frightened of someone so healthy.
15658140	15661140	Mom, I wasn't letting anyone in here. It's very dull.
15661140	15663140	You followed a bed or something?
15663140	15664140	Yes, I did.
15664140	15666140	I know. You were dreaming, weren't you?
15666140	15668140	Unfortunately, yes.
15668140	15670140	I know how you feel.
15670140	15672140	I have that dream a lot.
15672140	15677140	Oh, you stand on a windowsill getting ready to break the glass
15677140	15679140	and inside there's diamonds.
15679140	15681140	And then, Moonman, you fall.
15681140	15683140	It's not the same dream at all, stinky.
15683140	15685140	Snuffkin hasn't come back yet.
15685140	15687140	Have you heard anything from him?
15687140	15688140	He's very late.
15688140	15690140	Oh, Snuffkin.
15690140	15692140	Huh. You know something, don't you?
15692140	15695140	All I know is that he went away as usual last autumn
15695140	15696140	and hasn't come back yet.
15696140	15697140	And then...
15697140	15698140	Yes, what?
15698140	15701140	Snork Maiden wanted to go looking for him because she thinks
15701140	15704140	that if Snuffkin comes back, you won't be sick anymore.
15704140	15706140	But Snork wouldn't let her.
15706140	15708140	Snork Maiden?
15710140	15712140	Hey, Snork Maiden!
15712140	15714140	Snork Maiden!
15718140	15720140	You're not serious, are you?
15720140	15722140	I feel perfectly alright.
15722140	15725140	You look like that's warmed up if you ask me.
15725140	15726140	Thanks a lot.
15726140	15731140	Now, stinky, tell me which way does Snuffkin normally travel south?
15731140	15733140	Hey, are you going looking for him?
15733140	15737140	Yes, it's not really spring in Moonman Valley if he's not around.
15737140	15739140	It's just not right somehow.
15739140	15742140	Okay, you're all as mad as each other.
15742140	15744140	But you'll help me?
15744140	15747140	I've got to try and find him, stinky.
15747140	15750140	Yes, alright, but don't tell your parents I helped you.
15750140	15752140	Don't worry, I won't say a thing.
15768140	15771140	Sorry, stinky, are you okay?
15771140	15773140	No, I'm fine.
15775140	15778140	Here's your lunch, Moonman. How are you feeling?
15778140	15780140	Moonman?
15780140	15783140	Papa, come here quickly.
15786140	15789140	Oh, Papa, Moonman's gone. He's not in his bed.
15789140	15792140	Not in his bed? Are you sure, Mama?
15792140	15797140	Of course I am. His room is empty and there's no sign of him.
15798140	15800140	Perhaps he's in one of the other rooms.
15800140	15802140	Don't worry, Mama, I'll find him.
15805140	15808140	Yo, Moonman.
15809140	15811140	Moonman.
15812140	15814140	Hi, Moonman, Papa.
15814140	15815140	Oh, little Mai.
15815140	15817140	What's wrong? You look worried.
15817140	15819140	Moonman's gone off somewhere.
15819140	15822140	I expect he must have gone to look for Snuffkin.
15822140	15824140	Snuffkin?
15824140	15827140	Well, you know how crazy Moonman is about him.
15827140	15829140	It's stupid if you ask me.
15829140	15832140	But he's not well, he's got a fever.
15855140	15859140	Are you sure this is the right way?
15859140	15862140	Of course I'm sure. I live in this forest, don't I?
15862140	15864140	Why don't we miss each other somewhere?
15864140	15867140	Well, if you think he might, don't go there and it's up to you.
15867140	15869140	But I've got to...
15872140	15873140	Moonman!
15873140	15875140	Oh, Snuffkin!
15875140	15877140	Huh?
15877140	15880140	Where are you taking him, Stinky? You can see he's not well.
15880140	15884140	I'm not taking him. He insisted on going. I came to look after him.
15884140	15886140	Is that really right, Moonman?
15886140	15890140	Yes, I wanted to find Snuffkin, so he'd come back.
15890140	15892140	Well, I was going to find him for you.
15892140	15895140	Little Mai and Sniff were coming too, but they chickened out so I came on my own.
15895140	15898140	What did Snork say about that? I bet he wasn't happy.
15898140	15900140	Oh, he made a big fuss and I just let him.
15900140	15902140	So you just walked out and came on your own?
15902140	15904140	Brothers, always think they can tell you what to do.
15904140	15907140	I just ignored him. Did you tell your parents where you were?
15907140	15909140	Ah, no.
15909140	15912140	Did you put him up to this, Stinky? It's just the sort of thing you do.
15912140	15913140	No, I did not.
15913140	15915140	That's true, Snork Maiden.
15917140	15921140	Well, I don't know how you did it, Stinky, but I know you and I know you're to blame and I don't think I won't find out.
15921140	15924140	That's not fair, Snork Maiden. It was nothing to do with me at all.
15924140	15926140	Oh, he's right, Snork Maiden.
15926140	15929140	He didn't want to show me the way, but I made him.
15931140	15933140	I'm taking you home.
15933140	15934140	Oh, but Snork Maiden.
15934140	15939140	Look, no buttons. You're sick and you should be in bed and your parents must be very worried.
15939140	15941140	Look!
15941140	15942140	Moomin!
15942140	15945140	Oh, it's Papa. It isn't Snork behind him.
15945140	15947140	Oh, yes, it is.
15947140	15949140	Uh-oh, it's time I wasn't here.
15949140	15953140	I'm glad you hadn't gone too far, Moomin. I might never have found you.
15953140	15955140	I'm very sorry, Papa.
15957140	15961140	I have a feeling you're behind this, Stinky. Come on quickly, I'll with it.
15961140	15965140	Why doesn't anyone believe me? It was Moomin's idea. I swear it was.
15965140	15968140	It was, Papa. I wanted to find Snorkkin.
15968140	15971140	Are you all right, Moomin?
15971140	15973140	Snork Maiden!
15974140	15977140	Uh, here we go again.
15977140	15981140	Snork Maiden, what are you doing here? I thought I told you not to go on this silly jump.
15981140	15984140	Well, I didn't say I wouldn't. Did I?
15984140	15986140	Listen to me, Snork.
15986140	15990140	You're looking guilty, Stinky. How did you persuade her to disobey me?
15990140	15992140	See, I told you.
15998140	16002140	You stay nice and warm in bed and I'll mix some of grandma's potion with honey for you.
16002140	16007140	You'll have to be better soon because I have a feeling Snuffkin's on his way.
16013140	16017140	My wish Snuffkin would hurry up, then we could all get back to normal at last.
16017140	16020140	First, my sentiment's exactly.
16020140	16025140	So where is Snuffkin? Well, he's on his way back to Moomin Valley.
16025140	16030140	But he's had a very long walk and is getting very tired now.
16030140	16045140	Poor Snuffkin. He's had a terrible cold as well. This feeling rather weak.
16061140	16072140	Hello, I know you don't I?
16072140	16076140	Oh? Yes, you're Snuffkin.
16090140	16093140	Isn't that water still a little cold for that?
16101140	16105140	You'd better come by the fire and keep warm or you'll catch cold.
16110140	16113140	This is nice.
16113140	16124140	I'll be the one that's that by Snuffkin's fire. And he told me to keep warm and not catch cold.
16124140	16128140	That's no big thing, little fella. It's a pretty chilly night out here.
16128140	16132140	Oh, it is. I've heard so many stories about you from everybody.
16132140	16137140	And each year I try to watch you go past, but I've never been brave enough to talk to you before.
16137140	16142140	Stories from everybody. I don't know if I like that. In fact, I'm sure I don't.
16142140	16145140	What's your name, little fella?
16145140	16152140	Oh, well, I haven't got one. I'm so small that nobody's ever asked me before. I've always wanted to have a name, you know.
16152140	16159140	And it was you who asked me. And I've actually met you and sat next to you at your campfire. Oh, it's so wonderful.
16159140	16162140	You don't know how happy it makes me meeting you like this.
16162140	16165140	Oh, come on. You do go on a bit, old fella. You just get warm now.
16165140	16173140	Do you think Snuffkin? Oh, I don't know whether I should ask you. I don't want to offend you. Oh, well, why not? Yes, I will.
16173140	16180140	Perhaps you'd be kind enough to. I mean, would it be too much trouble for you to think of a name for me?
16180140	16184140	There. I've said it now.
16184140	16189140	Well, choosing a name is important. I'd have to think carefully about that.
16189140	16192140	But it will be easy for you. You know everything.
16192140	16197140	Now listen to me. You can't look up to people too much if you want to be yourself. It's not right.
16197140	16202140	But Snuffkin, you're so clever. You can do anything, anything at all. I know you can.
16202140	16207140	I've always wanted to be free like you to do whatever I feel.
16207140	16213140	Oh, I'm sorry I'm talking too much. I want to listen to you too. All about your travels for a start.
16213140	16216140	I know you're on your way to the Moon Valley to see all your friends.
16216140	16221140	The Hedgehog told me the Moon stayed up for most of the winter. Just waiting for you to come back.
16221140	16223140	Now isn't that wonderful? What?
16223140	16227140	I'd love to have someone that missed me so much they were miserable until I came back.
16227140	16230140	You don't know how lucky you are that you're so special.
16230140	16235140	Well, perhaps I'm not going there. I might have somewhere else to visit instead.
16238140	16242140	Oh, Moon will be very sad if you don't go back.
16242140	16245140	Yes, but you've got to have time to be on your own as well.
16245140	16249140	Of course you have, and I've taken up too much of yours now.
16249140	16252140	Wait, I think I'll be off. Okay, thanks.
16257140	16259140	Goodbye Snuffkin.
16259140	16261140	Good night, little fella.
16261140	16268140	Hey, wait a minute. What about your name?
16268140	16270140	You remembered!
16270140	16274140	Well, what do you think of TD Wu, my friend?
16274140	16280140	Yes, TD Wu. It's nice and happy to start with, and then a little sadness.
16280140	16282140	TD Wu.
16283140	16286140	That's right, TD Wu.
16286140	16289140	TD Wu.
16289140	16292140	TD Wu.
16292140	16294140	TD Wu.
16294140	16296140	TD Wu.
16296140	16298140	TD Wu.
16298140	16300140	TD Wu.
16300140	16302140	TD Wu.
16302140	16304140	TD Wu.
16304140	16306140	TD Wu.
16306140	16310140	Yeah, that's great. It's a wonderful name.
16311140	16316140	TD Wu. I'm glad you like it. It's the first time I've ever given anyone a name.
16319140	16324140	I think I'll be able to house, and then I can put up a real name plate that says TD Wu.
16324140	16327140	Ah, good idea, TD Wu. About what I said before.
16327140	16328140	Huh?
16328140	16334140	You know, not going back to Moonman Valley? Well, I am. I've missed Moonman and all my friends.
16334140	16339140	Oh, I didn't take that seriously. You just got upset at something, I said.
16339140	16342140	I'm afraid that happens a lot, I guess I talk too much.
16342140	16344140	Maybe you do.
16344140	16349140	I'll be going back to Moonman Valley a bit behind schedule, and this year Spring came along early too.
16349140	16353140	But I suppose it's better late than never, as they say.
16353140	16357140	Moonman will be happy. Say hello to everyone from TD Wu.
16357140	16361140	I will, and I'll tell them how it came about.
16361140	16366140	That's where you keep your harmonica, isn't it, Snuffkin? It's really famous, you know?
16366140	16368140	I didn't realize that.
16368140	16372140	Do you know? I've never ever heard any music.
16375140	16377140	Really? What would you like me to play?
16377140	16382140	Anything. Oh, I know. What about Moonman's favorite?
16398140	16403140	Oh, that's Snuffkin!
16418140	16421140	Oh, that's Snuffkin!
16428140	16433140	Don't move!
16448140	16452140	Snuffkin!
16458140	16463140	Snuffkin!
16473140	16479140	Now at last, Spring really has come to Moonman Valley.
16479140	16486140	They love the laughter, and they love the living, the movements.
16486140	16493140	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
16493140	16497140	They're always happy and always at play.
16497140	16504140	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
16504140	16508140	The movements.
16508140	16515140	They love the laughter, and they love the living, the movements.
16515140	16522140	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
16522140	16526140	They're always happy and always at play.
16526140	16533140	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
16533140	16538140	The movements.
16538140	16543140	The movements.
16563140	16566140	Here they are for one and all.
16566140	16569140	The movements are about to come.
16569140	16572140	Come on and sit down here with me.
16572140	16577140	They're here for you on your TV. They are the movements.
16577140	16580140	They are the movements.
16580140	16583140	So come with me, give me your hand.
16583140	16586140	I'll take you up to Moonman Land.
16586140	16589140	You can fly just like a bird.
16589140	16592140	Sing that song ever.
16592140	16594140	There were the movements.
16594140	16597140	There were the movements.
16597140	16600140	There were the movements.
16600140	16603140	There were the movements.
16603140	16606140	There were the movements.
16606140	16609140	There were the movements.
16619140	16647140	All is peaceful in Moonman Valley.
16647140	16650140	Mama waters the flowers.
16650140	16654140	While Papa relaxes in the shade on the porch.
16654140	16659140	Look, Mama, Moonman Papa is sleeping again.
16659140	16661140	He had a long nap yesterday.
16661140	16663140	I think it must be the weather.
16663140	16665140	Too hot and sunny for me.
16665140	16668140	I wonder if he's worried about anything.
16668140	16673140	You don't sleep if you're worried you do something about it.
16673140	16676140	But Moonman Papa does have something on his mind.
16676140	16679140	Although it doesn't keep him awake.
16683140	16687140	He's having a nice dream as well.
16688140	16697140	Mama waters the flowers.
16697140	16703140	Mama waters the flowers.
16703140	16706140	Oh, a lighthouse.
16706140	16707140	That's it.
16707140	16709140	Oh, oh, oh.
16709140	16712140	That's it, a lighthouse.
16712140	16714140	What about a lighthouse, Papa?
16714140	16716140	We're going to visit one.
16716140	16717140	Right now.
16717140	16720140	Well, as soon as I find one, anyway.
16720140	16723140	That should stop you being bored, Mama.
16723140	16725140	Oh, I'm not really dear, but it would be nice.
16725140	16726140	Yeah.
16726140	16728140	Oh, I'm really excited.
16728140	16730140	Just because it doesn't let me.
16730140	16732140	Lovely water.
16732140	16736140	Yeah, I'll write an exciting, epic novel of the sea.
16736140	16738140	I'm sure it will be a great success.
16738140	16742140	If he puts some action in it and misses out the romantic stuff.
16747140	16749140	Stop it!
16752140	16754140	Stop it!
16754140	16756140	Stop it!
16760140	16761140	Tell me.
16761140	16764140	Does Moonman Papa want all of you to go away to this lighthouse?
16764140	16765140	Oh, yes.
16765140	16766140	It'll be great fun.
16766140	16768140	Just think of all the ships we'll be able to see.
16768140	16770140	Yes, that will be good.
16770140	16773140	Papa says he wants to write an exciting story about the sea.
16773140	16777140	With ships and storms and stuff, probably pirates too.
16777140	16780140	Oh, he's stuck writing his memoirs again, is he?
16780140	16783140	Well, I guess that might have something to do with it.
16783140	16785140	But I think he just wants another adventure.
16785140	16786140	He's bored.
16786140	16788140	Well, it sounds a bit odd to me, Moonman.
16788140	16789140	No, it's not.
16789140	16793140	We're going to live in a real lighthouse and save ships from the rocks
16793140	16795140	and being wrecked terrible storms.
16795140	16796140	Oh, I see.
16796140	16799140	What do you think the lighthouse keeper might say about you moving in?
16799140	16801140	Oh, he won't mind at all.
16801140	16804140	It'll be company for him, and I'm sure he'd like someone to talk to.
16804140	16807140	Looking after a lighthouse is a very lonely job.
16807140	16812140	Ah, but if you thought Moonman, that might be exactly why he chooses to do it.
16812140	16816140	You mean that he might want to be on his own all the time?
16816140	16819140	Well, some people like it like that.
16819140	16822140	Sometimes I like being on my own.
16822140	16824140	Not for long, though.
16824140	16826140	It'll be a lot of fun.
16826140	16828140	Snuffkin, why don't you come with us?
16829140	16831140	What, to a lonely lighthouse?
16831140	16834140	Yes.
16834140	16838140	Ah, no, which one is it?
16838140	16840140	There, that's the one.
16840140	16841140	Where?
16841140	16844140	So small, you can hardly see it.
16844140	16847140	How long would it take us to get there, Moonman, Papa?
16847140	16849140	A day or two, I should say.
16849140	16850140	Depending on the window.
16850140	16851140	But it looks so tiny.
16851140	16852140	Oh, I don't know.
16852140	16854140	Well, I think so.
16854140	16856140	How do we know which one is which?
16856140	16859140	Oh, don't you worry about that.
16859140	16862140	I've got an old compass somewhere, and we've got the map.
16862140	16865140	Then at night we'll be able to see the light itself.
16865140	16867140	Anyway, an old sailor.
16867140	16868140	An old sailor?
16868140	16870140	Well, I'm not really that young.
16870140	16871140	And an old sailor.
16871140	16872140	Is this mutiny?
16872140	16875140	Don't be stupid.
16875140	16877140	How long do you think you'll want to stay, Papa?
16877140	16878140	About a month.
16878140	16882140	Oh, we'll need to take lots and lots of food, then.
16882140	16884140	Well, bless me.
16884140	16885140	I think that'll be enough, Mama.
16885140	16887140	Surely there'll be somebody living there already.
16887140	16889140	Don't be stupid, of course there is.
16889140	16891140	A lighthouse must have a keeper.
16891140	16894140	Yes, a man dedicated to the sea.
16894140	16896140	Suffering loneliness and hardship.
16896140	16899140	Saving countless lives with no regard for his own.
16905140	16907140	Is that you, Sniff?
16907140	16909140	Yes, hi, Mr. Hamilton.
16909140	16912140	I thought you'd be busy packing for the trip to the lighthouse.
16913140	16915140	No, well, I'm not going with them this time.
16915140	16917140	I've decided to stay here.
16917140	16919140	Oh, dear me, really?
16919140	16921140	Sniff can said he was going.
16921140	16923140	Well, I have something very important to do.
16923140	16924140	Important?
16924140	16926140	Sniff is just a big whip, that's all.
16926140	16928140	Oh, shut up, little mind.
16928140	16929140	Don't tell me to shut up.
16929140	16931140	I don't listen to whims.
16931140	16934140	Now, now children, no squabbling.
16934140	16936140	It wouldn't be fair to the others.
16936140	16938140	I'm not a very good swimmer.
16938140	16940140	You mean if you fell and then we're drowning,
16940140	16942140	and save you, don't fall in then.
16942140	16944140	Anyway, you could hang on to an or something.
16944140	16946140	What if it got swept away?
16946140	16949140	We'll put a life jacket on you stupid, don't worry.
16949140	16950140	What about the sharks?
16950140	16952140	They might take a fancy to me.
16952140	16954140	Wait a minute, I know I'm not as�ologist,
16954140	16956140	but I don't think there are any sharks around here.
16956140	16958140	I'm sure I would have heard if there were.
16964140	16967140	Well, it's a real fine day for sailing.
16967140	16970140	Where are mama and the others?
16970140	16973140	Don't worry, movement, there's no hurry.
16973140	16975140	Are you sure that isn't too heavy for you, Sniff?
16975140	16977140	No, not at all, mama.
16977140	16979140	It's a shame that you're not coming with us,
16979140	16981140	but if you've got something important to do, you must do it.
16981140	16983140	It won't be the same without you, though.
16983140	16985140	We'll miss you, Sniff.
16985140	16986140	Thank you.
16986140	16988140	Oh, dear, I left a jar of strawberry jam
16988140	16991140	and a whole batch of pancakes on the kitchen table.
16991140	16993140	Do you think you could manage to eat them?
16993140	16994140	Leave it to me.
16995140	16998140	Hi, y'all be lucky if there's any food left in the lard or mama.
16998140	16999140	He's a my.
