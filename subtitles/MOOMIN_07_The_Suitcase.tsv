0	21000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here for you are your TV, there are the movements, there are the movements.
29000	36000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.
36000	49000	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,
49000	59000	there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.
79000	89000	There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.
110000	119000	With all the excitement of that night, sniffed decided not to go home and was sharing movement's bed.
119000	123000	Snuffkin, as always, preferred to sleep in his tent.
123000	131000	You remember what happened, the horrible grok coming after thingamy and bob and everything freezing?
132000	138000	For a moment however, the night wasn't quite over yet.
138000	148000	Lonely papa, help me, the grok is after me!
148000	158000	I can't run anymore!
158000	178000	Run anymore!
178000	181000	Why am I on the floor?
181000	192000	Sniff?
192000	194000	Morning Mama!
194000	197000	Good morning Moomin, is sniff up yet?
197000	200000	You're joking, where is thingamy and bob?
200000	205000	They haven't stirred yet, the poor things are tired out.
205000	207000	Papa's not still asleep is he?
207000	212000	No, he's looking at my rose bushes.
212000	214000	Are they okay papa?
214000	216000	No, frozen to death and look.
216000	217000	What?
217000	225000	That's where she was standing over there where the grass is dead.
225000	230000	She must have been real cold to freeze the roses, what a shame, they were very pretty.
230000	235000	There's not much left of them now, we'll have to grow some new ones.
235000	237000	I dreamed that she was chasing me papa.
237000	242000	Oh don't worry Moomin, I think she's only after thingamy and bob.
242000	245000	So they're not fugitives from justice after all?
245000	250000	I have a feeling that they would prefer that moment.
256000	259000	Aren't thingamy and bob coming down?
259000	262000	Yes, if they could have breakfast in their room if you didn't mind.
262000	264000	Well, what did they tell you?
264000	265000	What?
265000	267000	About why the groke is chasing them.
267000	272000	Oh, they just looked terrified and wouldn't say anything about her at all.
272000	275000	You know, we really ought to find out why.
275000	277000	Yes, you're right.
277000	281000	Moomin Mama, why don't you take their breakfast up and see if they'll tell you anything
281000	284000	if any of us can get it out of the meal can.
293000	297000	Who's that?
297000	302000	It's only me, I've brought you both a nice breakfast.
303000	306000	Come here.
320000	323000	Well, what did they say?
323000	327000	It seems that the groke is after the suitcase, not them.
327000	331000	I wonder what's in it, perhaps they've stolen her mummy as well.
331000	335000	And they also said that it did use to belong to her.
335000	338000	Oh dear, if they've stolen it.
338000	340000	I don't know about that.
340000	344000	I asked them how they got it, but they wouldn't say another word.
344000	345000	Well, this is too much.
345000	347000	We could be harboring criminals.
347000	351000	I know they don't look like it, but you never know, do you?
351000	353000	You can ask the groke!
353000	355000	Don't shout.
355000	356000	No, that's no good.
356000	359000	We don't want to come back here most definitely.
360000	363000	Let's ask the police inspector to question them.
363000	365000	We don't want to get the police involved.
365000	367000	Well, you'll suggest something, Anne!
367000	370000	Quit shouting, sniff!
372000	376000	Look, why don't you just wait for them to tell you a moment?
376000	380000	I know it seems strange, but I've noticed that if you pretend not to be interested,
380000	383000	people can't wait to tell you those secrets.
383000	387000	They told Mama about the suitcase, but they wouldn't say anything to Papa.
387000	389000	You know something, Moomin?
389000	391000	They might open up to Snork Maiden.
391000	393000	She's someone more their own age.
393000	395000	You could be right.
399000	401000	Hey, Snork Maiden!
401000	402000	Where are you going?
402000	404000	Moomin house.
404000	408000	I'll come with you, but I thought you were living there.
408000	410000	I was until mumble came back yesterday.
410000	412000	How is she?
412000	415000	Bossy, and she snores, too.
415000	416000	Moomin!
416000	417000	Snork Maiden!
417000	419000	Where are you off to?
419000	422000	Well, I was just on my way to see you.
422000	426000	Oh, that's so nice, and I've come to see you, Moomin.
426000	429000	I brought you a little present, Moomin.
429000	430000	A present for me.
430000	432000	Yes, and it's very beautiful.
432000	433000	What is it?
433000	435000	Something you must never break or lose.
435000	437000	I promise I won't.
437000	439000	There you are.
439000	440000	Thank you.
440000	442000	Go on, open it.
446000	448000	A lot of beautiful shell.
448000	453000	I spent all of yesterday on the beach searching for it just for you.
453000	455000	Look, we can see ourselves in it.
455000	456000	So we can.
456000	458000	Thank you very much, Snork Maiden.
458000	461000	It's my heart, and I want you to look after me.
461000	463000	Oh, I will, Snork Maiden.
463000	464000	I will.
464000	466000	I'll think of you whenever I look at it.
466000	467000	I'm Moomin.
467000	472000	I promise you that I'll always kiss the shell before I go to sleep.
473000	476000	It will be my most precious treasure.
476000	479000	Apart from me?
479000	481000	So what shall I do?
481000	483000	Take them for a walk?
483000	485000	Yes, but take your time, and don't rush them.
485000	487000	I'll let them cry on my shoulder.
487000	490000	Yes, and try and talk to them as well, though.
490000	494000	I feel very important, and a little bit nervous, too.
494000	496000	Have some tea first.
496000	498000	Thank you, Moomin, Mama.
499000	501000	Ah!
508000	510000	We don't need your help, Little My.
510000	511000	Ha, that's what you think.
511000	513000	I'd be able to weadle out their secrets.
513000	515000	It's not an interrogation.
515000	517000	We only want to talk to them, you know?
517000	519000	So you can weadle out their secrets.
519000	520000	I'll be very quiet.
520000	524000	Little My, have you ever managed to be very quiet?
525000	528000	Not really, but there's only one way to find out.
528000	530000	You must let me go with Snork Maiden.
530000	535000	No, this situation needs a tender understanding, Moomin.
535000	537000	That's me, exactly!
537000	539000	You ready?
539000	540000	I suppose so.
540000	542000	Hello, it's Moomin.
542000	545000	Can I talk to you for a minute?
546000	548000	Hello?
548000	550000	This is Snork Maiden.
550000	552000	She's a very good friend of mine.
553000	556000	Hello, I'm very happy to meet you both.
556000	558000	She's very tender and understanding,
558000	560000	and she'd like to talk to you.
560000	562000	Can she come in?
563000	566000	Well, if she has to, Moomin.
568000	570000	Come in, Maiden.
573000	576000	You pee, you pee, you pee.
577000	580000	It's very beautiful, a perfect heart shape.
580000	583000	I've never seen anything like it, Moomin.
583000	585000	Would you like one, Mama?
585000	586000	No, my dear.
586000	589000	There should only be one shell like this.
589000	592000	Then would you keep it somewhere safe for me?
598000	600000	Well, self-kin.
601000	604000	I'm sure Snork Maiden will get it out of him.
604000	605000	I do hope so.
605000	607000	I think they like it anyway.
608000	612000	I have a feeling in my bones that Groke will be back tonight.
612000	616000	If we could find out why she's after them, we'd know what to do.
616000	621000	Mama won't have any garden left if that monster comes back every night.
621000	623000	Moomin.
630000	633000	Well done, Snork Maiden.
634000	637000	Little Mai.
641000	644000	Oh no, she'll ruin everything if we don't stop her.
649000	652000	If you win to fear little Mai, I'll never forgive you.
652000	655000	What, interfere? Me? Never.
655000	658000	Look, let's just leave it up to Snork Maiden now, little Mai.
658000	661000	You'll need me if Snork Maiden's not tender and understanding enough.
662000	664000	Hey, Moomin.
665000	669000	So, how is Snork Maiden getting on her, taking them for a stroll?
669000	671000	Where are they?
679000	681000	If we were narrow.
681000	683000	Papa, if we get much closer.
683000	686000	And the last thing we want is for them to see us.
687000	690000	Looks like I'll have to go and talk to them, you're all too big.
690000	692000	I'll come back later and tell you what they said.
692000	695000	No, don't. You'll upset Snork Maiden.
695000	697000	You're the one who's upsetting her.
697000	699000	Shh!
699000	703000	All right. Can I ask you again about the suitcase?
703000	704000	Yes.
704000	707000	Does that suitcase belong to you or is it the groaks?
707000	708000	No.
708000	709000	Yes!
709000	711000	No.
711000	713000	Let's try it another way.
713000	715000	Who's is that suitcase?
715000	718000	It's yours, it's ours.
718000	721000	But you told Moomin Mama that it wasn't yours.
721000	723000	It was the groaks.
723000	725000	Yes, we did.
727000	731000	Do you mind if I ask you one more time?
731000	733000	Please do.
733000	735000	Right, here we go.
735000	737000	Now, all I want is a simple yes or no.
737000	740000	Is that suitcase yours or not?
740000	742000	No, yes.
742000	746000	Oh, take your time, Snork Maiden.
746000	748000	And don't rush them, he said.
748000	750000	What was that, Snork Maiden?
750000	753000	Look, I'm sorry, but can I ask you again?
753000	756000	Yes, as many times as you want.
756000	760000	Thank you. This is the very last time, so please tell me the truth.
763000	765000	Now then, the suitcase.
765000	766000	Yes.
766000	768000	You know which one?
768000	769000	Yes.
769000	771000	Does it belong to you?
771000	772000	Yes, it does.
772000	774000	So it's not the groaks.
774000	775000	Yes, it is not the groaks.
775000	779000	At last, we're getting somewhere, praise the booble.
779000	781000	We're very happy for you.
781000	784000	Snork Maiden is really having to work hard.
784000	787000	I wouldn't have, I'd scare them into talking.
787000	788000	You should have let me go.
788000	790000	Yeah, but we wanted someone gentle.
790000	792000	Snork Maiden is nice.
792000	795000	Everybody in this house is nice.
795000	799000	Do you think they'd let us stay here forever?
799000	800000	Of course.
800000	802000	If we can keep away from the grog.
803000	809000	It took a long time, but in the end they trusted me, and now we're good friends.
809000	812000	Who wouldn't trust you and want to be good friends?
812000	813000	Thank you.
813000	817000	It wasn't easy, though. They kept speaking together and I got rather muddled.
817000	819000	But they did tell me somehow.
819000	820000	Rather muddled.
820000	823000	I told you, guys, you should have let me do it.
823000	826000	Oh, I'm afraid I didn't get very much, though.
826000	828000	I knew you wouldn't.
828000	831000	So what did you find out then, Snork Maiden?
831000	832000	Tell us.
832000	836000	Well, first of all, the suitcase does seem to be theirs.
836000	838000	That was one thing they made very clear.
838000	839000	Then Hulk and the grog.
839000	840000	Just a minute, Moomin.
840000	844000	What's in the suitcase on the other hand belongs to the grog.
844000	845000	That's the problem.
845000	849000	Oh, dear. So they do have something belonging to a...
849000	850000	Oh.
850000	852000	Well, Snork Maiden, what is it?
852000	854000	They wouldn't tell me what it is, little Mai.
854000	857000	Only that it is the most beautiful thing in the world.
857000	858000	Oh, is it?
858000	860000	I wonder.
861000	864000	This is very difficult to understand.
864000	868000	I mean, think of me and Bob don't look like thieves at all, do they?
868000	871000	So, the grog just wanted back what is hers.
871000	875000	I don't see how that big ugly monster could own the most beautiful thing in the world.
875000	879000	Well, what they said was that she just happened to have it.
879000	882000	They didn't say whether it belonged to her or not.
882000	884000	So she might have stolen it herself.
884000	886000	They shouldn't have taken it, though.
886000	888000	Oh, dear, oh dear.
888000	893000	Bob and Thingamy are very frightened of how she'll take her revenge if she catches them.
893000	897000	But they're very determined to keep what's in the suitcase, Moomin, Papa.
897000	900000	Oh, this is a fine mess indeed.
900000	902000	The grog is sure to come back tonight.
902000	903000	What can we do?
903000	905000	What can we do?
905000	906000	What can we do?
906000	908000	We can do the same as before.
908000	910000	Yeah, but it's not fair to drive her away.
910000	914000	If what's in the suitcase really does belong to her?
914000	919000	She means to get the suitcase and I don't think it will be so easy to get rid of her this time.
919000	923000	And if she stays, we'll have a never-ending winter.
923000	926000	Well, I'll cover up the petunias just in case.
926000	928000	Are you all going to stay here?
928000	929000	I'll look after Snork.
929000	931000	I will, Moomin, Mama, I'll stay.
931000	933000	You'll stay, won't you, Snuffkin?
933000	935000	Don't look so clam, everyone.
935000	936000	I've got an idea.
936000	939000	But it would help if we knew what was in that suitcase.
939000	941000	But even if we didn't, it could still work.
941000	943000	What is it, dear?
943000	946000	Just wait, Papa. You'll see.
1004000	1005000	Oh!
1016000	1018000	She's coming!
1018000	1019000	Are we?
1019000	1021000	She's not far away!
1021000	1024000	Oh, I hope Moomin Papa can do something.
1024000	1025000	It's your girl, little mom.
1025000	1026000	Yes, I know.
1026000	1028000	There's the king and the queen.
1028000	1031000	Uh, this one.
1031000	1033000	Uh-oh, she's coming.
1033000	1035000	Just when I was winning.
1035000	1038000	You better hide under the table, little my.
1038000	1039000	Don't be stupid.
1039000	1042000	How can I hit her with my rolling pin from there?
1051000	1052000	Where is she, Papa?
1052000	1054000	Exactly where she was yesterday.
1054000	1056000	I'll go for a toast, alright, Papa?
1056000	1060000	Let me go first and then the rest of you can fan out behind me.
1061000	1063000	Moomin Mama.
1063000	1065000	What is it, Papa?
1065000	1068000	Perhaps now's the time to tell us your idea.
1068000	1070000	We haven't long.
1083000	1085000	Wait, Grog.
1085000	1086000	Don't go away.
1086000	1088000	We want to talk to you.
1088000	1093000	We know that you've come back to get what thing of me and Bob took from you.
1093000	1096000	That is right, isn't it, huh?
1098000	1101000	Won't you let them keep it, perhaps?
1104000	1106000	No, will you sell it to them?
1108000	1110000	Oh, dear.
1110000	1114000	I have some very beautiful things here in my bag.
1114000	1117000	Maybe you'd like to trade, Grog.
1119000	1121000	What about this pendant?
1121000	1123000	Isn't it lovely?
1125000	1128000	So you don't like that?
1128000	1130000	What about this then?
1133000	1135000	Or this?
1149000	1152000	Oh, alright.
1152000	1154000	Why don't you choose?
1154000	1158000	Take anything you want from my handbag, except the hair slide.
1166000	1169000	Which one do you want, this one?
1169000	1172000	Let me see with this.
1173000	1176000	Oh, this one?
1178000	1179000	Oh, dear.
1179000	1181000	That's not really mine to give to you.
1181000	1183000	Snork maiden gave that to a moment.
1183000	1186000	Is it alright if I give the shell to her moment?
1188000	1190000	You'll never allow.
1190000	1191000	Are you alright?
1191000	1194000	Yes, my hand was suddenly frozen.
1197000	1199000	No, you've got the shell, Mrs. Grog.
1199000	1202000	Do you promise not to come back anymore?
1205000	1207000	Because I'll get you if you do.
1209000	1211000	Oh, my God!
1222000	1224000	Well, that was a close thing.
1224000	1226000	I'm glad that's over.
1226000	1229000	Oh, you were marvelous, Mama.
1231000	1233000	I'm so sorry, Moomin.
1233000	1237000	I forgot that I had put your precious shell in my handbag to keep it safe.
1237000	1238000	It's alright, Mama.
1238000	1240000	You gave it in a good cause.
1242000	1244000	What Snork maiden gonna say, Moomin?
1246000	1247000	I heard you.
1247000	1249000	You said you'd never go to sleep without kissing it.
1249000	1251000	Or something equally stupid.
1252000	1254000	Well, I'm not gonna tell Snork maiden.
1254000	1257000	But I think Mama did the right thing.
1258000	1259000	She'll find out.
1259000	1261000	I'm fed up with secrets.
1261000	1264000	I'm always gonna tell the truth from now on, no matter what.
1268000	1270000	Oh!
1273000	1274000	Moomin!
1274000	1275000	Moomin!
1275000	1276000	Look!
1276000	1277000	I found one!
1277000	1278000	Really?
1279000	1281000	Well, it's very similar.
1281000	1284000	But the one Snork maiden gave me was much bigger.
1284000	1286000	Oh, a lot bigger, was it?
1286000	1291000	Moomin had decided that he had to find a shell that was exactly the same as the one Snork maiden had given him.
1291000	1294000	Then with luck, she would never find out what he'd done with it.
1298000	1299000	Oh!
1309000	1311000	This is it!
1311000	1312000	This is it!
1312000	1314000	I killed it!
1317000	1319000	It's exactly the same as the other one.
1320000	1322000	Nothing short of a miracle, isn't it?
1322000	1325000	But then in Moomin Valley, miracles do happen.
1328000	1334000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.
1334000	1342000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.
1342000	1346000	They're always happy and always at play.
1346000	1353000	The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.
1353000	1363000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.
1363000	1371000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.
1371000	1375000	They're always happy and always at play.
1375000	1382000	The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.
1382000	1386000	The Moomin's.
1386000	1392000	The Moomin's.
