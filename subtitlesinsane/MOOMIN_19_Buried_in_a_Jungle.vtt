    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're here for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They are the movements.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, what do you think?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm going to say that I'm not going to say it. I'm going to say it. Here with me, here for you on your TV, they are the movements.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
They are the movements.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So come with me, give me your hand.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'll take you up to a moment land.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There were the movements.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:01:41.959
There were the movements. There was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la The seeds that movement and his friends had found in a box that had been cast up on the

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.000
beach had grown into a tropical forest.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It was beautiful, but also dangerous,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
with man-eating plants kept a bay by snuffkin playing as harmonica.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But for how long?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Oh dear. Oh!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Snuffkin, don't stop playing your harmonica whatever you do, or they'll only get angry and attack us all over again.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
If I don't stop soon, I might never want to play again.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Well, perhaps the music has made them more friendly.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Be careful, Mr. Hemmullen. Oh, don't worry.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Mr. Hemmullen and look out! What? Oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I want him.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I don't think the quickly stuck in play again! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:27.199
Ah! Papa, we must make sure the trap door won't open again. Ah, yes. What's this about a trap door?

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:32.199
In the kitchen. They almost got him before in the tag mama. We reached her just in time.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:04:06.000
Ah, there they are. I feel sorry for them. It can be helped, Snuffkin. If we let them out, we'll be...

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It's no life.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
It makes me feel very uncomfortable...

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
having man-eating plants under the floor.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Oh, I see.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I feel sorry for them.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
It can be helped, Snuffkin.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
If we let them out, we'll be...

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
eating a life.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.100
It makes me feel very uncomfortable... having man-eating plants under the floor. Now, we'll be... it in a life!

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.000
It makes me feel very uncomfortable having man-eating plants under the floor.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Always keep a kettle of boiling water

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and in case they break through.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.500
The children are playing Tarzan.

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:41.500
They might as well, seeing as they've got a jungle to play in.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.199
Still, planting those seeds might have been a terrible mistake.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.399
Well, mama, I'm very glad that you did.

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:49.500
Just think what I would have missed.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.839
And, moment, valley suddenly being full of tropical plants

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:53.920
is wonderful.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.279
I'm not fond of traveling, as you know.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.519
And you've brought the plants to me.

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:01.319
Well, the trees make it much cooler.

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:03.079
But those man eaters.

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:05.000
I could do without them.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Oh!

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
You're just like Tarzan.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Tarzan loves Jane.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Oh, what bliss!

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I knew it!

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Stinky's over there.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Stinky.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Tarzan, teach old Betty lesson.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Yaaah!

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Ah!

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Ah!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Ah!

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Ah!

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Ah!

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:05:43.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Pretty stupid moment playing Tarzan without wild animals. Animals don't come from seeds. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Maybe it's chimpanzee. I know exactly what you need.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Cheese.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Bread.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Ah.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
What are you doing, Mama? Well, I don't like the thought of all those man-eaters still in the cellar.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.199
So your father and I are going to sleep in the bathhouse.

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.399
We'll sleep outdoors too. We've just built ourselves a hut.

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:32.199
Snork maiden and little Mai too.

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.800
Yes, there's plenty of room.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.800
All right, so that only leaves Mr. Himmelon sleeping in the house.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.800
And he still busy checking all the different plans.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.000
Mama, is everything ready?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Oh, yes, dear.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Oh, aren't we ready?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Yes, we are, Mr. Himmungen.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
See you later.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Stinky said he could get some wild animals, Papa.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We're ever fro.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I don't know.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I wouldn't trust him. He'll probably put a hedgehog in your sleeping bag.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
There it is. The hunt.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.519
Oh, oh, that very well built. I'm not sure if I can get a chance to see the other other

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:27.519
other

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:29.519
other

00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:31.519
other

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:33.519
other

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:35.519
other

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:37.519
other

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:39.519
other

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:41.519
other

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:43.519
other

00:07:43.519 --> 00:08:05.439
other other other I tell you, it's a wonderful place. You'll love it. A real tropical jungle. Are you sure it's quite nice here?

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:09.160
Well, of course, there you are.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:48.000
Oh. Oh, lovely it is to run free. Darling, let's be the first to get to Moomin Valley. Eh. Eh. Eh. Soon I'll have the largest collection in the botanic world,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.200
and I will be famous, and people will come from all over.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.200
Now what have we here?

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.700
Go away, I'm not a zoologist.

00:09:14.299 --> 00:09:17.299
Look, Moon. Those must be the monkey stinky promise to us.

00:09:17.299 --> 00:09:21.500
Well, that's a surprise. Not like him at all. I just don't trust him.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.440
What sweet things!

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.440
Just like in Tarzan.

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:30.679
Huh?

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:32.200
What was that?

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200
I don't know.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.200
Huh?

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.559
That sounds like some really wild animal, a lion or a tiger.

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:46.120
I'm frightened, movement.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.220
Huh?

00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:01.039
Very odd, just like home, isn't it?

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:03.120
Even if it isn't very big.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.840
Perhaps we could live here.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.799
Let's go hunting first, ice mill, humans.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.200
Or be careful, darling. You're very out of practice.

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:19.000
I must warn them.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.600
See anything?

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.000
No other thing. It must have been imagination.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Run man!

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Keep quiet!

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Little Maw!

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I've just seen some tigers.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
They're coming to get you!

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Tigers!

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Let's get back to the house quick!

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
There's no time!

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
They're nearly here!

00:10:39.000 --> 00:11:02.000
We'll go to the bathhouse!

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Shall we eat him up? You know that Hamilins upset your tummy, dear, Est?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
I wonder where the movements are.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Huh?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Ah, just more animals that's all.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.600
Papa! Papa, help!

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
What's the matter, Mumin?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Little Maya's seen two tigers and they're looking for us.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Tigers after us.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.500
That rotten stinky probably told them we're good to eat or something.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.919
Maybe we are.

00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:49.879
They'll be here in a minute.

00:11:49.879 --> 00:11:50.679
Right, moment.

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:53.000
You go and find the biggest stone you can

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.759
and bring it back with you.

00:11:54.759 --> 00:12:20.000
OK. This way.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Papa will this one do? Yes, that's perfect. Right, get into the bathhouse and it's wiggly now. Here they come.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Are you really going to eat them, Dearest?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.299
Of course, my love. You see, I think they're hiding in that little house up there.

00:13:06.299 --> 00:13:10.299
They've been very quiet if they are.

00:13:10.299 --> 00:13:12.100
Huh, they're just too scared to move.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.200
That's all.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.200
Why's that stone there?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.200
Whoa!

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.200
Whoa!

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.200
Whoa!

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
My darling! Hey, it worked Papa! Well of course, Mumann.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
My husband is drowning.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Oh, I'm so sorry Papa we must help.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
He was just about to try and eat us Mama.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.200
I'm sure he won't do it again.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:14:07.000
I suppose so, Mummyn. Hmm. I never thought I'd see the day. Moments rescuing a tiger.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Here you are, dear.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Tithe is tightly around him and we'll lift him out.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:44.320
Thank you, mother. Oh, darling.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Why, you are right, my love.? What happened did we eat them?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
No you were drowning and they rescued you!

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Oh?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Now embarrassing!

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Well they're in that cabin behind you if you still feel hungry but it was rather good of them to save you.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
No my appetite's completely gone.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
We'll come back here then and we'll go.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.299
I'll just jump over.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.500
What?

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.500
What?

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.299
Oh.

00:15:14.299 --> 00:15:15.100
What's the matter?

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.600
I can't remember how to jump.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.299
We've been stuck in that zoo for too long.

00:15:19.299 --> 00:15:23.799
Well, try and swim across, dear, East.

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:27.000
OK. the class dearest. Okay. Hmm?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:37.000
We copped everyone.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
The tigers are leaving.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I'm glad he didn't grow.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.600
I knew they wouldn't be mean enough to eat us after saving him. Let's throw.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I knew they wouldn't be mean enough to eat us after saving him. Shall we jump in and swim back as well? It's not far.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Yes. I'll go first.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I want to go first.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Don't, little mind. Be careful, movement. Look over there.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Crocodiles!

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.500
Oh hurry up, moments!

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.000
Swim around the back and come up the ladder!

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
How can there be crocodiles in the sea? I thought they only lived in fresh water.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
How are we going to get back to the shore now?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
We'll have to wait for a boat to come past.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
No, I'm afraid we'll have to think of something else, Mama.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
We could be waiting for a wink or something for that to happen.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
A whole week!

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
But we'll starve, all they'll find is our bones bleached, waiting the sun.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Don't worry, little my. Papa will think of something you'll see. I'll be back! I'll be back! I'll be back! I'll be back! I'll be back!

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
I'll be back!

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I'll be back!

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I'll be back!

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I'll be back!

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I'll be back!

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
I'll be back!

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I'll be back!

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I'll be back!

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I'll be back!

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
I'll be back!

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I'll be back!

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I'll be back!

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I'll be back!

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I'll be back!

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I'll be back!

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I'll be back!

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
I'll be back!

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
I'll be back!

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I'll be back!

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.799
I'll be back! I'll be back! I'll be back! I'll be back! I'll be back! I didn't fancy landing a sea monster.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.599
Help! Someone help! Help anybody!

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:51.000
That's Mr. Hemmulin. Oh, the Tigers must be after him quickly! I never made you so cross. I just told you not to eat my plants. Let me in! Oh!

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
That fella's always been clumsy. We can't really help him.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
No.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Oh.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Oh.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Oh.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Oh.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Are you all right, Himmulan?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Oh, dear, I think so. What about you? Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh, you're right, Himmungen. Oh, dear, I think so.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.319
What about him?

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:08.319
Oh, dear.

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:09.579
What are you doing, Irino?

00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:11.039
Get stuck in your brando.

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:12.680
Oh, this is anew, and on me.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.440
So I'm loose.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.880
I can't think of any other way.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.680
You have to be very careful, though.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:26.000
I think you're tasting? Yeah, I think you're tasting. Yeah, I mean, you think you're tasting.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Ah, look where you're going.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
It was you who brought all the animals in, wasn't it?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Yes, you're right.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
That's what you wanted.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
It's a jungle now.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I did a good job.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Oh, really?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Well, they're not wild animals at all.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
They're quite friendly.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Friendly?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Ugh. They're quite friendly. Friendly! Uh... See what I mean? They make very good pets. Cute, aren't they? Ugh. Snake!

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I'll stick where are you!

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Why do you want?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
The rhino and the tigers have become pets of the movement family.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
You're not going to let that happen to you.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Well, are you?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
I'm not.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Snake!

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Snake, where are you?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Why do you want?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
The rhino and the tigers have become pets of the movement family.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
You're not going to let that happen to you.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Well, are you?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Snake!

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Snake! Snake! Snake, where are you? Why do you want? The rhino and the tigers have become pets of the movement family.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
You're not gonna let that happen to you.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Well, are you?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
It's not.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
I'll bring snorked maiden and movement here tonight.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
There's no need to eat all of them just bite off their tails, alright?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Okay.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
You'll be really amazed like I was.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
It's big enough for both of you to sit on.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
How lovely, a giant water lily.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
I wonder if the seeds came from that box you all found.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Oh, I can't wait to see it.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Looking at the size of the jungle, there must have been an awful lot of seeds in that box.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
I suppose the wind could have blown them anywhere.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Where's the giant water, Lily? Let's see now.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Uh, over there.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Oh!

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
How wonderful!

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
You see, I wish you'd learn to trust me.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
I'm a very honest guy.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.920
It's so soft and pink and beautiful.

00:20:35.319 --> 00:20:38.619
How romantic to be on a boat made from a flower.

00:20:38.619 --> 00:20:43.279
This is unbelievable. Our old box seems to have grown into a tropical swamp.

00:20:43.279 --> 00:20:46.779
It's a lot nicer. Hey, stinky.

00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:49.079
Stinky?

00:20:49.079 --> 00:20:50.180
Oh.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.680
I can't see him anywhere.

00:20:54.779 --> 00:20:57.019
I wonder how far we'll float.

00:20:57.019 --> 00:20:59.019
It's getting dark, moman.

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:01.019
Whoa!

00:21:01.019 --> 00:21:02.019
Whoa!

00:21:04.019 --> 00:21:05.519
Whoa! Whoa!

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.240
Gotcha!

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.559
We must get away!

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.759
We're!

00:21:13.759 --> 00:21:14.839
I don't know!

00:21:14.839 --> 00:21:15.599
Yet?

00:21:15.599 --> 00:21:17.119
Locke, there's the sea!

00:21:17.119 --> 00:21:18.640
Put the crooked aisles!

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.680
Over there, Stark made them!

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.640
A boat!

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.200
Well, it's the only way we'll get away from this monster!

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.200
AHHHH!

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.200
UGH!

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.200
AHHHH!

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.200
UGH!

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Keep going, Snork Maid. We're almost there.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Wait!

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Mumin and Snorkmaid kept swimming as fast as they could.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
They had a head start on the snake, but now he was catching up.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.839
Even though movements are very good swimmers, unfortunately for them, so are snakes.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.640
They love the laughter,

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:15.440
and they love the living, the movements.

00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:18.720
Believe it is sharing and caring,

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.720
and giving the movements.

00:22:23.519 --> 00:22:27.000
They're always happy, and always at play.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:40.000
The movements, the movements, they love the laughter

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
and they love the living, the movements

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000
We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
They're always happy and goes at play

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:13.519
The Moons are having fun day after day, the Moves, the Moves
