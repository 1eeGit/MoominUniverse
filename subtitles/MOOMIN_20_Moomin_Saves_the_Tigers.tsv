74640	82480	Vah, vva, vva, vva, vva …
82480	92060	Vah, vva, vva, vva, vva …
92060	112980	The rhino and the tigers that stinky set free from the zoo are now living in the jungle
112980	117420	that has grown up around Moomin house and have settled into the restful life of Moomin
117420	118420	Valley.
119420	122420	Hey, have you seen Moomin?
122420	124420	No, you haven't seen him all evening.
124420	125420	Hmm.
125420	129420	I wonder where they got to.
129420	134700	Meanwhile, Moomin and Snork Maiden chased by the snake and are swimming as fast as they
134700	135700	can out to sea.
135700	138700	I can't swim another.
138700	141700	Soon must not wait until you bust.
141700	142700	Hey!
142700	146700	Hey, you there!
146700	151700	Come on, Snork Maiden!
151700	152700	Nearly there!
152700	156620	Look, there's a couple of hippos that come in towards us.
156620	157860	We better get them on board.
157860	158860	That's funny.
158860	162540	I haven't heard about any hippos reported missing from the zoo lately.
162540	173540	Just a bit further, Snork Maiden.
173540	175540	We made it.
175540	178540	I didn't know hippos could climb so well.
178540	181700	Oh, thank you so much.
181700	183780	There was a huge snake chasing us.
183780	186580	Yes, we saw you were lucky we came along when we did.
186580	187900	Thank you for your help.
187900	189380	Who's ship is this?
189380	190380	ours.
190380	191380	We're from the zoo.
191380	192380	The zoo?
192380	195020	Oh, you've got one of the crocodiles.
195020	198060	Yes, and a lot of trouble he gave us as well.
198060	199860	There's another one around here somewhere.
199860	200860	We saw them.
200860	204060	Yes, we know there is, but we haven't been able to find him yet.
204060	205060	Oh, boy.
205060	207780	I wish they'd come as quietly as you hippos did.
207780	208780	Hippos?
208780	209780	Hippos?
209780	211540	Which zoo are you from?
211540	213780	I bet they'd pay well to get you back.
213780	214780	Now look here.
214780	215780	I'm a woman.
215780	216780	Not a hippo.
216780	217780	Are you saying that?
217780	218780	I look like a hippo?
218780	221420	Well, perhaps they don't look exactly like hippos.
221420	224260	No, but they're close enough, Captain.
224260	227060	I'm sure they've escaped from the zoo somewhere, though.
227060	228060	Yes, sir.
228060	230020	We haven't escaped from anywhere.
230020	231340	Certainly not a zoo.
231340	232340	We live in Moomin Valley.
232340	233340	We're Moomin's.
233460	234660	It's all right, Snort Maiden.
234660	236220	I'll not be taken for a hippo.
236220	237940	Come on, let's run for it.
237940	239100	Hey, wait.
239100	241580	There's a nice cozy cage already for you.
241580	242900	Hurry, Snort Maiden.
242900	244660	Ask to them.
244660	245580	Stop them now.
245580	247420	Don't let them get away.
247420	248180	Huh?
248180	250020	Where are we going, Moomin?
250020	251020	Now to the sea.
254100	254780	Quickly, man.
254780	256700	Lower the light, boat.
256700	258420	They're not going to put us in any zoo.
263700	264860	Why did you come back?
264860	266980	I thought you were on the boat.
266980	267820	Oh, no.
267820	270780	Don't worry, I never eat anything when I'm not swimming.
270780	272340	Are you sure?
272340	275940	I'm sure I know where's this ship.
275940	277700	Oh, they're catching up with us.
277700	280500	They want to put us in a cage and take us to the zoo.
280500	281940	Me too, I expect.
281940	283700	They're always trying to get me.
283700	285140	They've got one of the crocodiles.
285140	285860	Oh, did they?
285860	287100	They were my friends.
287100	287780	Right.
287780	289260	Hang on to me, you two.
289260	291700	I'm certainly not going back to any zoo.
291700	292740	Never, let's go.
293740	294900	Oh, no.
294900	296340	Now hold on tight.
299340	301380	Come back, you horrible rascal.
301380	302380	Come back.
306380	308540	Moomin's been caught by a big snake.
308540	311220	Yes, mama snorked maiden as well.
311220	313780	Dear stinky, that's not true, is it?
313780	316660	I wish people wouldn't realize that I almost never lie.
316660	319140	I'm sorry about them, but I thought I'd better tell you.
319140	322380	Oh, there aren't any snakes that big in Moomin Valley.
322380	323900	There are tigers here, aren't there?
323900	326220	Well, there's big snakes too.
326220	328260	You brought the snake here, didn't you?
328260	331220	Papa, I'm not saying that I believe him,
331220	333100	but I think we'd better look for them just
333100	335060	to be on the safe side, don't you?
335060	336340	OK, don't believe me.
336340	338420	I've told you so my conscience is clear.
338420	341020	We're exactly to the snake attack them, stinky.
341020	343180	Down in the swamp by the sea.
343180	345100	Let's go, mama.
345100	346260	I'll come with you.
346260	349300	No, you'd better stay little, my, until Moomin, where we've
349300	350620	gone if he comes back.
350620	353180	He'll only worry if there's no one here.
353180	355980	And stinky, you show us where to go.
355980	356460	OK.
363540	364500	Hi!
364500	367620	Oh, oh, oh, I'm thinking now.
367620	369820	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
369820	370780	Hey, you.
370780	373460	Have you eaten Moomin and Snark Maiden?
373460	374460	It's all right, mama.
374460	375460	We're here.
375460	377220	Oh, praise the boo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
377220	378260	Say it.
378260	379260	Me time you, friend.
379260	383860	a very big friend. Please come in as much of you as you like.
383860	386260	Stinky just told us that you and Snorkmaiden
386260	388260	been caught by a big snake, so we...
388260	390260	Where are you going, Stinky?
391260	394260	She did chase us at first, then we managed to get on a boat,
394260	396260	but they wanted to put us in a cage,
396260	398260	so we jumped back in the sea, met the snake again,
398260	400260	then they tried to catch her too,
400260	402260	so she helped us to get away, and now she's our friend.
402260	404260	Who are they?
404260	407260	Men from the zoo. They've come to recapture all the animals
407260	410260	and take them away from the jungle, and put them in cages again.
410260	413260	Nice. Secondly, don't want to go back in the zoo.
413260	416260	Papa, we've got to protect our friends.
416260	418260	Yes, we have.
418260	421260	I'm sure that the tigers and that nice rhino don't want to go back either.
421260	423260	Oh, of course they don't.
423260	426260	They want to be free and let begin our jungle.
426260	429260	Why don't you go and explore it? I'm sure it'll be just like home.
429260	433260	And if you see the zoo people, you can come back here, can't you?
433260	436260	I'm sure you'll like it here, Missy Snake.
436260	438260	Yes, I'm sure I will.
438260	441260	Come on, I'll show you the jungle.
443260	447260	I'm so relieved that you're both all right at home.
447260	450260	So are we, Mama, but there's something we haven't told you.
450260	454260	Yes, they thought we were hippopotamuses.
454260	458260	What? Who did? They need their eyes, Destiny.
458260	461260	The men from the zoo. They thought we had escaped from another zoo,
461260	464260	and we're trying to catch us, and they nearly succeeded.
464260	468260	Hmm, a rude. We're not at all like hippos, the cheek of it.
468260	471260	So these men were only trying to capture our new friends,
471260	473260	but you and Snork Maiden as well.
473260	475260	And me and Papa if they'd known about us?
475260	477260	That's right, Mama.
477260	478260	They're idiots.
478260	481260	Hippopotamuses don't wear aprons or right memoirs.
481260	483260	That's really made me angry.
483260	486260	I bet they never faced the wrath of a movement Papa before.
486260	490260	I want to see you wrap yourself round and choke somebody.
490260	493260	I know. How about the tiger?
493260	495260	He do.
495260	499260	I'd rather not. We became friends in the zoo.
499260	503260	Oh, I know. Choke stinky. That'll be much better.
503260	508260	Yes, my dewey did let us out of the zoo.
508260	511260	Well, you're a great disappointment to me.
511260	513260	I let you out because I thought you'd attack the movements,
513260	516260	but you have tea with them instead. You're pathetic. You know that?
516260	519260	I'm sorry, but we were brought up in captivity,
519260	523260	and we never had to hunt for our food. All our meals are brought to us, you see.
523260	526260	But your tigers, what do you eat them?
526260	529260	Well, we love cat food.
529260	531260	Cat food.
531260	533260	Oh, I don't believe it.
533260	537260	Yes, it's easy to chew and it leaves our fur all sleek and shiny.
537260	540260	We like the yellow tins with the black cat. Don't we, honey?
540260	544260	Yes, it's our favorite. You wouldn't happen to have any on you, would you?
550260	552260	Oh.
564260	567260	Mama! Papa, quickly!
568260	571260	They're here. The zoo men are here.
571260	575260	Oh, get all the animals into the house first, you.
575260	577260	Hurry, moment.
577260	579260	Okay, Papa.
581260	583260	The zoo men have come to get you.
583260	587260	Hurry, you'll be safe in the moment house.
587260	591260	Quick as you can, Rhino, into the house. Go on.
595260	597260	Now, Rhino, push them.
597260	599260	I'm sorry.
608260	612260	Um, I don't think that's a good place to hide, Mrs. Snake.
613260	616260	I'm afraid that doesn't look quite right, Tiger.
616260	619260	I thought I might just look like a thick rug.
619260	622260	I'll just lie here like a beautiful porcelain ornament.
622260	625260	They'll never know we're here, darling.
625260	630260	Well, they'd never expect to find a Rhino under there.
631260	633260	That's what I thought. Where are they?
633260	636260	They can't just have vanished into thin air.
639260	642260	Look, up there.
642260	644260	In the chimney.
648260	651260	So they're in there, are they?
661260	663260	Papa!
672260	675260	They've seen the snake. They're nearly here.
677260	680260	Now, I want you to calm down and be quiet, everyone.
680260	682260	We won't let them take you away.
682260	685260	I promise you they'll have a fight on the hands if they try.
686260	688260	Keep, please, my love.
702260	704260	Hello?
705260	708260	Hello? Hello?
709260	711260	Having a picnic, are you? It's lovely, Dave.
711260	714260	Not at all. We're all here from the zoo, sir.
714260	717260	Oh, are you on some sort of expedition?
717260	720260	Excuse me, but are you the owner of this house?
720260	724260	Yes, indeed I am. I'm movement papa. What can I do for you?
724260	727260	Why don't you consent out the animals hiding in your house?
727260	729260	That'll do for a start.
729260	730260	Animals?
730260	734260	Oh, no. We have firm believers that they belong out there.
734260	739260	Sir, you can't see from where you are, but I can assure you that there is a python sticking its head out of your chimney.
739260	741260	A python?
741260	743260	Yes, that's right.
743260	745260	No, it isn't.
745260	747260	It isn't.
747260	750260	No, it's my daughter. She happens to look like a python.
750260	752260	Not all the time you understand.
752260	756260	Right, come on, man. We'll go and get the zoo's property.
756260	759260	No, you will not enter my house.
759260	762260	All right, well, you let the animals out. We won't have to.
762260	766260	It's up to you, sir. There are no animals, and you won't enter my house.
766260	771260	Now, wait a minute. I do believe, yes. You're one of those hippos, aren't you?
771260	775260	I am not. I'm movement papa, and I am the owner of this house.
775260	778260	No, you're not. You're a hippopotamus. How dare you?
778260	782260	A hippo who owns a house, and it's also running an illegal zoo.
782260	784260	Break down the doors.
784260	787260	That is against the law.
787260	792260	Oh, it is, isn't? Well, there's a nice cage winning for you as well, movement papa, hippo.
792260	796260	I warn you, if you touch that door, you'll regret it.
796260	799260	No, yeah.
799260	802260	Great boys, let's go in.
802260	805260	Charge!
806260	808260	Ah!
828260	831260	Now then, what's going on?
831260	833260	Little Mike brought the inspector.
833260	836260	Oh, right. What do you mean that you're doing?
836260	839260	Ah, they're hiding animals from the zoo in this house. We want them back.
839260	842260	I tried to reason with the hippo, but it was no good.
842260	846260	Oh, have you know that's willful destruction of property, my good man?
846260	849260	It's not willful. We're from the zoo. We got to get in somehow.
849260	854260	Oh, have you, and can you be sure that there are zoo animals in there?
854260	860260	You just take a look up there at the chimney. That's all I'm sure. Go on.
861260	863260	See that python's head sticking out?
864260	865260	That's odd.
865260	867260	I can't see a python's head.
867260	870260	But there was a python's head up there, I saw it.
870260	873260	Ugh, I can't breathe.
874260	877260	Now you listen to me, zoo man.
877260	880260	Either you stop bothering my friends or I'll arrest you.
880260	882260	Is that clear? Well, is it?
882260	885260	Yes, sir, it is. But what about the zoo animals?
885260	888260	You heard the inspector now go away.
888260	889260	Do you see that?
889260	890260	See what?
890260	891260	The hippopotamus.
891260	892260	What?
892260	895260	The hippopotamus. He's the fellows from hiding all our zoo animals.
895260	897260	We got a nice cage lined up for him as well, inspector.
897260	899260	Oh, so that's your plan, is it?
899260	901260	Ha, they want to take them all.
901260	904260	Moomin, snork, me, mama, and papa.
904260	906260	Hmm, the criminal conspiracy.
906260	907260	Conspiracy?
907260	909260	It would probably be called kidnapping.
909260	911260	Once you can't kidnap a hippo.
911260	913260	That's a movement.
913260	915260	It could be white slavery, though.
915260	918260	I'm sure I could add incitement to riot to the list.
918260	921260	Now, I hate paperwork, so I'll tell you one.
921260	923260	If you're gone within 10 minutes, I won't arrest you.
923260	926260	Why don't you put them in the deepest dungeon, inspector?
926260	928260	The one with all the rats and spiders and scorpions
928260	930260	that'll teach them to put Moomin's encages.
930260	934260	That's a good idea, little mind. They like animals.
934260	937260	I'll start counting now.
937260	940260	One, two, three.
940260	942260	Get around men quickly.
942260	944260	All right.
944260	946260	We'll have to think quickly on this one, man.
946260	948260	Come on, now. Does anybody have any smart ideas?
948260	952260	Come on. We're running out of time.
952260	953260	One minute.
953260	955260	Look, guys, we're going to figure something out right now.
955260	956260	Ready and look.
956260	959260	One minute, thirty seconds.
959260	962260	Two minutes. Three minutes, thirty seconds.
962260	963260	Look.
963260	965260	Leave us alone, way we're conferring.
965260	968260	All right. Six minutes and fifty seconds.
968260	969260	Time's up.
969260	970260	You're cheating.
970260	973260	The police don't cheat, and now you've got...
973260	975260	nine minutes and thirty seconds.
975260	977260	How about that?
977260	979260	Nine minutes, fifty bucks, I give up.
979260	980260	Everybody beat it.
980260	982260	But we're still discussing it.
982260	984260	No, we're not. We're getting out.
984260	988260	Look, everyone, the zoom in, they're running off.
988260	989260	Great.
989260	991260	You've got to come and see this, Mama.
991260	994260	Nine minutes and fifty and a half seconds.
994260	997260	And don't come back. We'll be the dungeon for you.
997260	999260	And I make that ten minutes up to you.
999260	1001260	You saved his little life.
1001260	1003260	It was really clever of you to fetch the inspector.
1003260	1006260	Well, there were too many of them for me to fight.
1006260	1009260	Okay? Everyone, come on now.
1015260	1017260	And so everyone was saved.
1017260	1019260	And eventually, they all came out of the house
1019260	1021260	to go and have fun in the jungle again.
1021260	1023260	As long as the warm weather lasted,
1023260	1025260	there were plenty of things to do.
1025260	1027260	But one day, the weather changed.
1027260	1030260	And cold winds blew down Moomin Valley.
1031260	1034260	Oh, it feels like autumn has arrived.
1034260	1037260	The jungle won't like the cold weather.
1037260	1039260	Do you think it will die, Mama?
1039260	1041260	I'm afraid it will, little my.
1041260	1046260	It grew very quickly, so perhaps it will go the same way.
1046260	1048260	And it did.
1048260	1052260	The whole jungle withered and died in just one night.
1058260	1060260	I think I've done a cold coming, Mama.
1060260	1063260	I'm sorry, I can't get the house any hotter.
1063260	1065260	I missed the zoo, at least it was warm now.
1065260	1067260	Yes, this cold is awful.
1067260	1070260	It would warm them up if we bird the dead jungle.
1087260	1089260	Now they're happy again.
1089260	1091260	But for how long?
1111260	1113260	Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys.
1113260	1115260	It's cold again.
1115260	1117260	It's warm in our cages.
1117260	1119260	What are you afraid here?
1119260	1121260	Yes, free to have pneumonia.
1121260	1125260	I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spending the winter here.
1126260	1130260	And so all the animals decided to return to the zoo.
1130260	1134260	Perhaps we'll let you come back next summer, Mrs. Snake?
1134260	1136260	I like that, when it's warmer.
1140260	1143260	Hey, look, the animals are on their way back!
1143260	1145260	All right!
1145260	1146260	That wonderful!
1146260	1148260	Oh, it's good to see you.
1148260	1150260	You don't know how much we missed you.
1150260	1152260	Oh, good.
1152260	1153260	Gosh.
1153260	1156260	We'll come back right now, old fella. It's good to see you.
1156260	1158260	Come on now, get back to your cages quickly.
1158260	1160260	We've been keeping them nice and warm for you.
1160260	1162260	Go on, off you go now.
1162260	1165260	You look all right, but I'm sure you must all be starving.
1165260	1168260	We'll do you a special meal tonight, all right?
1168260	1170260	Ah, the hippos, too.
1170260	1172260	For the last time, we're movements, not hippos.
1172260	1175260	You must be cold as well. We'll warm up a cage for you.
1175260	1177260	It'll be nice and cozy there.
1177260	1178260	No.
1178260	1180260	No, it just came to send the animals off.
1180260	1182260	Hey, get a cage ready for the hippos.
1182260	1184260	Well, you're nice and warm.
1184260	1187260	At the risk of sounding repetitive, we are movements.
1187260	1190260	Don't be ridiculous, you mullet here.
1190260	1192260	But we're nothing like hippos.
1192260	1196260	We know you're not purebred, but the public will never be able to tell.
1201260	1204260	Do we have to stay here forever, Papa?
1204260	1207260	Of course not, Momen. Don't worry. I'll think of something.
1207260	1210260	You will, won't you? Have you got any ideas?
1210260	1214260	Well, not yet, but I am a writer, you know.
1218260	1220260	Don't cry, Snorth maiden.
1220260	1223260	I'm sure there won't be only hay to eat.
1223260	1225260	I don't mind as long as we're together,
1225260	1228260	but what if they put us in separate cages?
1229260	1233260	Well, that would be awful. They wouldn't do that.
1233260	1237260	Well, perhaps the inspector will come looking for us.
1237260	1240260	When he realizes that we've gone as well as the animals,
1240260	1243260	he'll bring the full power of the Lord to bear on them.
1243260	1245260	Oh, look, there's someone coming.
1245260	1246260	It's Snorthkin!
1246260	1247260	And Hamilton!
1247260	1249260	And a little Mai! Snorthkin!
1252260	1256260	Hi, Mumen. Don't worry. We'll have you guys out in just a minute.
1259260	1261260	Please come out.
1264260	1267260	Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to let you out.
1267260	1271260	I'm in charge of this zoo. I'm afraid it was quite an understandable mistake,
1271260	1276260	but please accept this token of apology from the Board of Trustees. Here you are, madam.
1276260	1281260	Mr. Hemmilan and I went to the Royal Academy of Science just to sort all this out.
1281260	1285260	We've been given a letter from the President stating that you are not hippos.
1285260	1288260	Mr. Hemmilan's scientific background helped persuade him,
1288260	1291260	so you can all come home now.
1291260	1296260	Well, it just goes to show you must never judge by appearances alone.
1298260	1299260	Mama!
1299260	1300260	Yes, Papa.
1300260	1303260	Do you think I should grow a beard?
1303260	1304260	No, Papa.
1304260	1305260	Papa.
1312260	1319260	And so autumn came to Mumen Valley, a new season with different weather and different pleasures.
1326260	1332260	They love the laughter and they love the living and the moments.
1332260	1339260	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1339260	1343260	They're always happy and always at play.
1343260	1347260	The movements are having fun day after day.
1347260	1350260	The movements.
1350260	1354260	The movements.
1354260	1361260	They love the laughter and they love the living and the movements.
1361260	1368260	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1368260	1373260	They're always happy and always at play.
1373260	1377260	The movements are having fun day after day.
1377260	1380260	The movements.
1380260	1384260	The movements.
1384260	1390260	The movements.
1390260	1396260	The movements.
