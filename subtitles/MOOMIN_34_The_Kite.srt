1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:59,000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:39,200
Winter was just around the corner and that was the time of year for movement to get restless.

7
00:01:39,200 --> 00:02:00,400
Because this was the time of year for Snuffkin to leave Moomin Valley on his yearly trek south.

8
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,200
Good morning, Papa. That bonfire looks inviting.

9
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,400
Now you're up already. We're buried in leaves this morning after that wind last night.

10
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,200
Yes, winders on the way. Oh, this is a lovely bonfire.

11
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Yes, isn't it?

12
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,400
I guess we're hibernating again this winter. Are we moving, Papa?

13
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,800
Well, of course. We always hibernate in the winter.

14
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,400
If Snuffkin says I could go with him, couldn't I give this winter a miss and hibernate longer next year?

15
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,600
Mord. Oh, please, Moomin, Papa.

16
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,800
Snuffkin would rather go alone, I think, Moomin.

17
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,000
But I might get him to train his mind.

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,200
But Snuffkin's not really a person who likes to be pressed.

19
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Why not?

20
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,600
Well, he's a very solitary person. His winter trip is the only time he can really be alone for a while.

21
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,400
I know, but I was just hoping.

22
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,000
Snuffkin likes you very much. I know that.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And I think that's why he stays in Moomin Valley for the rest of the year.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,200
But at heart, he's a vagabond and he needs time away from us.

25
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,400
He's not a family man, so he's free to do as he wants.

26
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,600
And as his friend, you should try to understand.

27
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,600
I know you'd like to go with him, but I don't think it is such a good idea.

28
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,000
He'd really hate to turn you down, I know.

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I guess.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But he'd have to.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh.

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh.

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why aren't they biting?

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I haven't had a proper catch for days.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Getting too cold, is that?

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
When are you leaving?

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're about to leave, aren't you?

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes.

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Could I ask you something?

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What?

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't go without telling me.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But why?

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm always sad when you leave, even though I know you'll return in the spring.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah. Me too, sort of.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's why this year I'd plan to leave without saying anything.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'd like to wish you good luck and all that.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I miss you so much when you're away.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Please, Snuffkin.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Moomin, I have a better idea.

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I won't leave until after you've started hibernating.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Then you won't miss me, will you?

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're right.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll take a great idea, Snuffkin.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Then we won't really part at all, won't we?

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Nope.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Because I promised to be back here in Moomin Valley before you even woken up.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Wonderful. What a super idea.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Hey, Moomin!

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh, Snuff.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Moomin, come here a minute.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
There's something funny caught up in a tree.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What do you mean, funny?

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't know exactly. Never saw anything like it before.

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Snortmain a little my-founded first, but it's too high to get it down.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay, I'll come have a look.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Be careful.

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Be careful. What is it, Moomin?

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I know what it is. It's a kite.

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, what?

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
A kite is something you fly in the sky.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But it has no wings.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No, you send it up against the wind on a string.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's right!

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh!

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's right.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Where'd it go?

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, through it though.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's all right.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh, song, this is what a kite looks like.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Looks broken to me.

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sure we can fix it and make it fly.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Let's see.

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, no.

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The string must have broken when someone was flying it

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and the wind blew it down into the tree.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, why don't we repair it?

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes, let's.

89
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Looks pretty badly broken to me.

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Well, I don't know.

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We'll have to see.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It is a kite, isn't it?

93
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Can we mend it?

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Maybe.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
A very odd kite.

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It must have come from far away.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You think it can be repaired?

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Of course.

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Well, come on then.

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Snork will help you repair it.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I can repair it without your help.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
As long as you can find us some really long string,

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
strong but not too thick if possible.

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I think I have what you need.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Some string.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Good. Excellent.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll start immediately.

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Good.

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Good.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Good.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Good.

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Good.

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Good.

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Good.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Good.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Good.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Good.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Good.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Good.

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Good.

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Good.

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Good.

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Good.

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Good.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Good.

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Good.

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Good.

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Good.

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
A really exciting project I haven't flown a kite for years.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I do hope that string is long enough.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Snowark, is this okay?

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Fine, who's gonna fly it?

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll do it.

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Ok, Sniff.

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Moving, hold the kite up high.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Like this?

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Hmm.

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Alright, Sniff, are you ready?

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah, I'm ready. Don't let go till I say win.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Hmm?

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Win, moment!

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh!

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Uh oh, it's falling.

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Try again, and this time start running, and when the wind catches the kite, you start paying out the light.

145
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Alright, fine. Hold it up again, moment.

146
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Right.

147
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Ready?

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, I'm ready. Let go of it!

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Is it going up yet?

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No, it isn't!

151
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Stop, Sniff! You're breaking the kite!

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I don't think this kite's any good for anybody!

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The kite's fine. It's just that the wind is too weak.

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Alright, we'll have to wait for it to get stronger.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Titty though, we certainly had a good strong wind yesterday.

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Is it okay?

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I think the wind is getting stronger, moment.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
There it goes!

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
With me, hold the string, moment.

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Boy, this wind is really strong! Can I let out the string now?

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Do it slowly, mind. Alright!

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Let me do it, Sniff, come on, it's my turn!

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let me break your kite, little boy.

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Why not? Because you don't win, I'm told it!

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm very strong!

166
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Boy, it's quite right, you go up with it!

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You're Sniff!

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes, Papa?

169
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's difficult to hold it for a while.

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Well, yes, you'd like it.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Hold it really tight, then.

172
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Alright, I could do this long before he was born.

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Oops!

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What's happening?

175
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Papa, why did you drop quickly?

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Hey, I'm winding, I'm winding.

177
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Faster!

178
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh, winding faster!

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That was definitely not my fault.

181
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Of course it wasn't, with such a strong wind up there,

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I think we have to lower the center of gravity a bit.

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The kite's alright, Papa?

184
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Hmm, maybe it would take me with it.

185
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's it!

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I suppose that's to stop it from spinning around, is it snorke?

187
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes, that's right.

188
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What is it?

189
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Listen, I'm going to ride that kite.

190
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What did you say?

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I think it's going to be okay now.

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
If I hold on really tight, I think I could have a wonderful ride on that kite.

193
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yes, maybe it'd be wonderful while you're up in the sky,

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
but you've seen how fast it can come down again.

195
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But the snorke just said it won't fall down again.

196
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Even so!

197
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm going to do it.

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But no one must see me or they might try to stop me if they guess what I'm up to.

199
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Oh, please don't do it.

200
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What are you doing?

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Listen carefully.

202
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes.

203
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
When we fly the kite next time...

204
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Huh?

205
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What are you two whispering about?

206
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We weren't snorked, Maiden.

207
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I was just saying to Sniff that the kite wouldn't fall down again.

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It won't! Snork is fixed it.

209
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But you can't be absolutely sure.

210
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And you'll be holding the kite, won't you, Sniff?

211
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Me?

212
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Now then, do you want to do it, woman?

213
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes, and this time I'll let out all the line.

214
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And Sniff, you could hold it up, okay?

215
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes, that's fine.

216
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm counting on you, Sniff.

217
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And so am I, Sniff.

218
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Are you sure you'll be all right?

219
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Of course I will, silly.

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well, I'm not so sure.

221
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Why don't you keep your eyes closed then?

222
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Good idea.

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Okay, Sniff.

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Let go of it when I say ready.

225
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Bye.

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Ready!

227
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah!

228
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's it. That's all of the line.

229
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's very high.

230
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Must be some wind up there.

231
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's flying really well, isn't it?

232
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Certainly is.

233
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

234
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
This is getting bumpy.

235
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh!

236
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What's that?

237
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'd say there's something very strange happening on that kite.

238
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What is it?

239
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I can't see properly from here.

240
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I saw something.

241
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Could it be a bird, maybe?

242
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The kite is turned again, but it wasn't a bird.

243
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Or a twig or something, then?

244
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I can't see.

245
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Do you see the back of the kite from where you are, Sniff?

246
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No, Mom and Mama, because my eyes are closed.

247
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh.

248
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I think I know who it is.

249
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Little Mai.

250
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What?

251
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
No, I haven't seen that on my phone.

252
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
She seems to have disappeared.

253
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't ask me anything.

254
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I know nothing at all about it.

255
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Sniff, what do you mean?

256
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
She was dead set on riding the kite.

257
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I couldn't stop her.

258
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What?

259
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Moment, bring it down very slowly.

260
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Huh?

261
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Take it easy, Moment.

262
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That wind is strong.

263
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It could break the line.

264
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But that was what a friend was best streamed.

265
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's the knot I wore in the board knot.

266
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The warmth between our line and the bit that was still hanging from the kite when we found it.

267
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The knot is fine.

268
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
If the knot is another knot.

269
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's over.

270
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh my God.

271
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's over.

272
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's over.

273
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's over.

274
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Hang on tight.

275
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Little Mai.

276
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That wind is getting stronger.

277
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, this is more scarier than I thought.

278
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll just have to hang on as best as I can.

279
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Don't move around so much.

280
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I can't help it.

281
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's almost down.

282
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What?

283
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh.

284
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's not open.

285
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Come on.

286
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Jeff, get up.

287
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
All right.

288
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Snort, play yourself together.

289
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yes, all right.

290
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
She's being blown away towards lonely mountain.

291
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Snort.

292
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh.

293
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I do hope little Mai really is indestructible.

294
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Where in the world is this kite taking me?

295
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
All lonely mountains.

296
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm a long way from home.

297
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Little Mai.

298
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Little Mai.

299
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Now she's going towards the forest of witches.

300
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
She'll be all right if she fell into a tree when she...

301
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I can't see her.

302
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
There's no sign of her.

303
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Well, I'm almost sure she was heading this way.

304
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What is it, Sniff?

305
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Imagine she might have fallen somewhere.

306
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
She might be lying there waiting for help.

307
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh, stop imagining things, Sniff.

308
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
She's still up there.

309
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm sure of it.

310
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What is it, Papa?

311
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I saw something up there.

312
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Little Mai?

313
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
No, Sniff.

314
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No, it looked more like the Hobgoblin riding his panther through the sky.

315
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Really?

316
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Did you see that?

317
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Did you?

318
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You found me, Mai.

319
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
No, the Hobgoblin.

320
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Then it was him.

321
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Forget the Hobgoblin.

322
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We're looking for Little Mai and all you can think of is the Hobgoblin.

323
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Hobgoblin.

324
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh, come on.

325
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I won't shoot you.

326
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Stop it, you're screaming.

327
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Let go of my hair.

328
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Stop it.

329
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Where could she be?

330
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This is no good.

331
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We'll never find her wondering about like this.

332
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Moomin, over here.

333
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You found her?

334
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
There she is.

335
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Try to cheer up, Snork Maiden.

336
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'll try.

337
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Don't worry, Snork Maiden.

338
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Moomin, Papa, will find her for sure.

339
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Mama, Snork Maiden!

340
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm so glad to see you.

341
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But I just knew you'd be all right.

342
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Like Moomin Mama said, Little Mai really is indestructible.

343
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But just possibly it served her right to have her hair pulled.

344
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
There's still no sign of Little Mai?

345
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No.

346
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Be careful, Moomin!

347
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Lizzo!

348
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Be careful, Moomin!

349
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:27,360
Finally, the name was rescued too, but he almost certainly had a fun worst scare than

350
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,320
that were all mine.

351
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:07,360
The move ends, the move ends
