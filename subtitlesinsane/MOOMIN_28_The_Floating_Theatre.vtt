    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Therefore you on your TV they are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They are the movements.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So what do you think?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I think it's a good idea. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:01:19.920
sing that song ever, there were the movements, there was the moments One day in Newman Valley, not long before midsummer on a perfectly ordinary day, Snuffkin suddenly

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.560
announced that he was going on a short trip.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.640
Where are you going, Snuffkin?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.200
Well, not very far.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.000
I'll be back right after mid-summer.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.120
Oh, but Snuffkin, you missed the bonfire at the big party.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.319
But why in the world are you going away?

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.840
There's something I've been dying to do for a long time,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.400
and it has to be done on mid-summer eve.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.959
I promise to tell you all about it,

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.379
moment, as soon as I'm back in movement valley.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.420
Little did Snuffkin know that before he came back,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.620
the underwater volcano, which had kept quiet ever since

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:24.800
movement pop as youth, would wake up again. I don't think I like this.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.000
I think it's exciting.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
In that case, you can have it.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The woman mama.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Yes, what is it, dear?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The hammock is shaking.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It's very unpleasant.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I think it's that volcano you told us about.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Yes, I guess it must be.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Mama!

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Papa!

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Oh!

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.039
They're smocked. Rising from the street, Papa. I guess it must be. Mama! Papa! Oh!

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.800
There's smoke rising for the city, Papa!

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.639
Smoke!

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:49.639
Oh!

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:50.639
Oh!

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.639
Oh!

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.639
Oh!

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.639
Oh!

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.639
Oh!

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:55.639
Oh!

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.639
That's very awesome.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:58.639
What is it, Papa?

00:02:58.639 --> 00:02:59.639
That's easy!

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:00.639
What's going on?

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:01.639
I don't know, really.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.639
I guess they're all over the place.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.639
Oh!

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:04.639
Oh!

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.000
Oh! That's very awesome. What is it, Papa? Let me see! What's your action quite? Get a pound of eruption!

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
What's going on?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I don't know really. I guess there isn't much we can do.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Hey!

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I can't see.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Where is it?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Let me see now. It's my turn.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Now I'm at first!

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Yes, now I've got it.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Let me see! No, I'm three. Let me see!

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
No, I'm first.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Moving purple would be worth quakes as big in your youth.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
No, they certainly weren't.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And this one's underwater.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Oh, my net goes a tide of wolf.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
A tide of wolf.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Oh my goodness, it never saw that.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Hey, what's your turn?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Snatch me the net.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
What do you doing? Snatch me, lad.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
What do you think?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Can you see anything unusual, woman, papa?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I've never seen anything like it.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
This is very unusual.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Oh, my!

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I want to see it too!

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Come on, I can't stand it!

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
How can you fight during a catastrophe?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Whatever you do, don't!

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Get the test off!

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
We need to Oh! Oh!

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Oh!

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Oh!

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Oh!

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Oh!

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Oh!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Oh!

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
You're so stupid.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
You should have let me have it first.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
It's all your fault, little my.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Anyone can see that.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
How dare you say it was all my fault.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
It doesn't mean we didn't get it.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
It's all the whole way.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Oh. How dare you say it was all my fault because it was you! Oh!

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Snork maiden? Yes?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I'm standing watch over my flying ship,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
so why don't you stay over in Moomin House?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
You'd be careful!

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You look after her once you move in, Poppos?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Certainly, Snork.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I don't like the look of things.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
No, do I.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
No, do I.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
We better get inside moment house quickly.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Everybody have a good time.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
It's scary.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Your head and your earthquakes are getting out of here. The Go, go, go, go, go! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Oh, my God.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Oh, my God.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Oh, my God.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Oh, my God.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Oh, my God.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Oh, my God.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Oh, my God.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Oh, my God.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Oh, my God.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What's that noise? Listen, can you hear? Huh? A noise? What noise?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I don't know.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Sounds like water to me.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Oh no!

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
What's happened?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
The movement house is drifted off to sea!

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Oh no!

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
What's happening?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
What's happening?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
What's happening?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
What's happening?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
What's happening?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
What's happening?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
What's happening?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
What's happening?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
What's happening?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
What's happening?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
What's happening?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
What's happening? What's happening? What's happening? What's happening? What's happening? Sounds like water to me. Oh no!

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
What's happened?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
The moving house is drifted off to sea!

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I don't believe this.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I think movement valley is flooded.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It really is.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
What's happened to the kitchen and dining room?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Just goes I fear.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
What are we going to do?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Mum and Mum can't even prepare breakfast down there.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Oh, good morning. You're up early today.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Mama, Mum and House is flooded.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
All of Mum and Fala, here's under water.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Oh dear, I think you're right, Mum.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
It's poppies still asleep.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Let's go and wake him up. He definitely wouldn't want missed it. Oh dear, I think your right, movement is poppin' still asleep.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Let's go and wake him up, he definitely wouldn't want missed it.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Boy, I'm sleepy.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I'm even sleepy.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I didn't sleep a wink because he was snoring.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Little my was snoring so hard, the whole bed was shaking.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I'm gonna have a nap soon as I've had something to eat.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Hey, snap!

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
What's this?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Where am I? What's happened here?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Woman house is flooded, Smith!

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Oh, pop! This means I'll have to swim to get home!

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
You'll have to dive to get into your house!

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Hmm, unless I'm mistaken, the water is still rising!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Mom and Papa, you gotta do something! Do something right away!

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I think you better start taking swimming lessons.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.519
And don't worry, Sniff.

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:49.519
I'll start organizing.

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:51.519
What do you want organized, Mumma?

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:52.879
Well, dear, I guess we should have

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:54.480
some breakfast first of all.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.639
Yes.

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:58.839
But how do we get into the kitchen, Papa?

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:00.839
You just leave that to me.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:12.319
There, your kitchen. I've never seen it from above before. Oh, my goodness. People

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:18.579
should look at their rooms from above once in a while. Look, cars of food floating from

00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:25.839
the cellar. What luck we have a trap door. My my shall I dive in and get them? Yes, please, Moomin.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.759
Be careful, Moomin.

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:30.399
It's gotta be done.

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:31.879
Hurry up, Moomin.

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:32.679
I'm hungry.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.679
Oh.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:47.000
Ugh. Can you get us some bows and plates this time? Sure. And indeed, the water was still rising.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
It's coming! It's coming!

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Help!

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
The water's up to the third floor.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
The third floor is up to the third floor.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
The third floor is up to the third floor.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
The third floor is up to the third floor.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
The third floor is up to the third floor. The third floor is up to the third floor. And indeed the water was still rising. It's coming! It's coming! Help!

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
The water's up to the third floor!

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
What are we gonna do, Mom and Papa? Where's Mom and Papa?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
He's up on the roof, Smith, with the others.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
What are they doing up on the roof?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Ah, there goes another poorly built house.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Why doesn't our house float away, Papa?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
It's all very simple, dear son. I built it myself.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
If you hadn't, maybe we wouldn't be about to sink altogether.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Here we are.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Are you coming to help me, everybody?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
This is one of Grandma's best plates. So please be extra careful.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I know. But where do you think we're going, Mom?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Something will float by. Big enough to take all of us. We just have to wait.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
I'm not gonna wait for that. I think this family's out in touch with reality.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Something big enough will float by indeed.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I'm gonna see my old skin while I'm still tired.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
This is something I should have done immediately, but it's not too late.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Look! There's a whole house drifting by!

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Oh, you're right. It's very odd looking house though.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Yes, it does look funny, but I think we better take it.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Hmm, that's the one we're getting. Yeah. So who will be the real great one?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Oh, I'm stopping with you.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Don't leave me behind.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Where's that house?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Right over there.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Just there.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Catch us, see it, Snapp.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Oh, that house.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
What?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:55.000
You call that a house?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Oh...

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Hurry up, Sniff! What are you doing? I just changed my mind! That one looks like it's going to sink!

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.440
No, it's fine! We're all aboard. Come on.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.639
I don't believe you. Soon as I'm aboard, it'll sink. I'm feeling.

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:14.639
He's scared of his own shadow. Let's leave him. Move any such a whimp.

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:16.559
Come on. It's all right.

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:20.639
Now, don't worry about me. You can let go of the ladder. I'm fine.

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:22.779
Stay behind if you like, Sniff.

00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:24.559
Look what about your breakfast?

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:25.000
Uh-oh. We have all the food here and you might get hungry. Stay behind if you like Sniff, but what about your breakfast?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
We have all the food here and you might get hungry and if you do, there'll be nothing to eat.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Why didn't you say so before?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And now hold the ladder steady, and I don't want to be abandoned.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:49.000
No, brother, he's coulda made kinga know what is it he actually ever followed. I'm falling on it!

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I'm falling on it!

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Don't do this to me!

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Don't shake it!

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Don't shake it!

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Don't shake it!

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Hold it steady!

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Excuse us!

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Hello!

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Anybody home?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Don't worry, we're not dangerous.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Isn't breakfast ready yet? I'm starving to death.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
There's no one here, Papa.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I think you're right, it certainly seems empty.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Oh, and the most exciting empty house I've ever seen.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.720
Why do you say that? What do you mean exciting? Do you mean interesting or do you mean scary little my?

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:30.399
Interesting and scary looks Norgmaiden look around

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:38.559
What a lot of mirrors this house must have been full of women who loved glow or maybe just one woman

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:42.519
Snorkmaiden who had as many faces as there are mirrors in this room

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.840
Look every mirror has a chair in front of it,

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.320
place just like so.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.039
This house was full of ladies

00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:51.799
and he chatted her a little mirror.

00:12:59.799 --> 00:13:02.600
Thank goodness we brought some plates with us.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.759
Woman, mama, woman, woman! Look what I found!

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:07.919
Bread naples!

00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:09.039
How nice, sniff!

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:10.919
Now we can have a real breakfast.

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:12.960
But where is everybody?

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.620
Well, I don't know.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:16.919
Somewhere around.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.480
Whoever lived here must have had a lot of strange hobbies.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.000
You're so right.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Hey, who said that?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Wow, look at that cog wheel.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
The snorke would love that.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I wonder what Moonman will say about this little mind?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I'm sure he'll say you look better without anything.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
One look at you and he won't even notice anything else.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Well, if he has any sense, he will fall for me like a ton of bricks.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
You want about breakfast, woman, mama?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
We'll have breakfast as soon as we are all here.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
I wonder where they can all be.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
You know, it's very bad for me to go hungry.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I always feel unwell if I don't eat.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
All right, sniff. You go ahead.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
But mind you don't eat all the apples.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Leave some for the others, won't you?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Oh, don't worry, of course I will, mom and mama.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Oh, but where on earth did you find them Smith? We need a fruitful.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
But no one will trick the play on people making false fruit.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
I very upset.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Oh, this is not bread.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Oh.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Ow, ow, ow.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Who could have done such a cruel thing to me?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Somebody with a very art sense of humor, I'd say.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Somebody without anything!

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Have some cheese instead, that at least comes from moving valley.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And it looks delicious.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Whatever these levers for.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Uh-huh.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
What's that hear you sound?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
It's creepy.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Get you here and it sounds like a new earthquake.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Yes, I can hear it.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
It's scary and spooky and creepy.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
All you need to stride on me on my mind.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Oh, I wonder what it can be.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
It's very strange indeed.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I just don't think I can take another earthquake right now, moment.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Yeah?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Oh my goodness. Oh, look. What is it, sniff?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Last moment, Bob, a lot!

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Why? Our table is gone.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
This is a haunted mansion, moment, moment.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Well, they can't take grandma's plates just like that.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
You can have them laid back, but I'll keep the cheese.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.600
I like that. You can have them laid back, but I'll keep the cheese. I like cheese.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.600
This is a good cheese, Dad.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.759
No, Mama.

00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:52.639
Yes, I certainly did.

00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:54.840
Better not let our food out of sight.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.639
Let's get out of this house, please, Mama.

00:15:57.639 --> 00:15:58.919
Oh, son.

00:15:58.919 --> 00:16:00.639
What's happening?

00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:01.639
What?

00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:04.399
Oh, will I be getting out of home?

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:05.000
Eat a lot! I'm sorry. You will have to get out of here, the one!

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
What?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
What?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
What?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
What?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
What?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
What?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Ah! Oh, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I'm so happy.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I'm so happy.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I'm so happy.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Papa, was it the witch who was laughing?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
No.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
The left is coming from that ugly one.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
I'm so happy.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Behind there.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I'm so happy.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I'm so happy. I'm so happy. You're behind there.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Did I hear someone call me an ugly thing just now? Oh, excuse us, Madam. You must be the owner of this house.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
No.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Oh?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Indeed I am not.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Most certainly not. You are greatly mistaken.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
This is no house you fold. This is a theater.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
A theater? Yes.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
This is a stage where the heroine receives a standing ovation at the end of the last act.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And the bread and the apples are props.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
And the rumour you were playing is where the actors make themselves up to become totally different people.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Kings or murderers.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Oh, and you were one of these actors? Ah, actress! You understand less than nothing!

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
See this broom here? This is my only prop.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
I sweep the dust in this theater.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Oh, really?

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
I have wielded this broom for nearly 20 years!

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Would nobody to help me?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
20 years I have cleaned this theater beautifully!

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
My name is Emma.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.700
Emma! And you? You better remember that this is, beautifully! My name is Emma. Emma!

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:46.700
And you!

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.420
You better remember that this is at the theater.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:54.059
This is no ordinary house, and it is a great honor for you to be here at all.

00:17:54.059 --> 00:17:55.460
That's true.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.299
Does this mean that we can stay here just for a while?

00:17:58.299 --> 00:18:00.140
Yes, until the actors return.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.140
Today they all came to a low-verset.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.140
Oh, nice!

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.000
That's, nice!

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
That's so nice!

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
That's really cool.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Yes, it certainly is.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
We'll try not to bother you with mine.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Come on, let's go!

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Let's go!

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Come on, let's go!

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Come on, let's go!

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Come on, let's go!

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Come on, let's go!

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Come on, let's go!

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Come on, let's go!

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Oh, no!

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Oh, no!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Oh, no!

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Oh, no!

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Oh, no!

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Whoa!

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
What have you done?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Oh, you seem to have hit a tree, so the house has stopped.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
This is a theater not a house!

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Oh, it's a rowing tree.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Oh, lovely it looks.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
How nice to have crashed into such a beautiful tree.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
It's gorgeous!

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
And that smell.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
You know what?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
I'd like to spend the night in that tree!

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Great idea, Moon!

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
I'm coming with you!

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
How exciting!

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
You better stay here. You're bound to fall into the water.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Look who's talking! Scary cat!

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
That looks safe. We could easily spend the night here.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
We better tie the theatre to the tree so it won't drift away.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
If that's all right with Emma. Emma, is it all right to tie the theatre to the tree?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.359
Do what you want! As long as you don't damage the theater, dear, here?

00:19:27.359 --> 00:19:28.559
All right.

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:29.599
Ha ha ha!

00:19:29.599 --> 00:19:32.079
Don't whistle you idiot!

00:19:32.079 --> 00:19:34.240
Don't ever whistle in a theater!

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.480
That's the worst luck possible!

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.480
How dare you!

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.480
Oh.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:52.400
Uh...

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.000
This is great snorkemaiden. We can look at the moon.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.400
And the flowers, they smell so good.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.400
What's the matter?

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.400
I hope that snorke's alright.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.000
Don't you worry.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
He was standing guard over a flying ship after all.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:40.000
All you have to do is get on board and fly away. What's going on here?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Huh? Hmm. Ah!

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
No, they're trying to destroy the Pampers box.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
I've never seen anything like it.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
These people are bunch of vandals!

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Ugh! Meanwhile, movement and snork made their fast asleep, blissfully unaware of what was happening.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.500
But what ever will they do, stranded on the treetop.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:39.500
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:46.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
They're always happy and goes at play

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
The movements are having fun day after day

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:17.962
The movements, the movements, the movements The most
