WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:46.000 --> 00:58.000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

01:16.000 --> 01:46.000
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

01:46.000 --> 02:16.000
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

02:16.000 --> 02:19.600
Tiki's arrival was very welcome.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.340
Good evening, Mom.

02:21.340 --> 02:25.280
Tiki, come in.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.680
Mama, Tiki's here.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.280
Come on in, Minnie, a neat Moman.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.600
Uh-oh.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.280
Is there someone with you?

02:35.280 --> 02:37.400
Yes, I brought my friend, Minnie.

02:37.400 --> 02:42.160
Minnie, don't be shy.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.280
Well, there's no one there.

02:43.280 --> 02:44.360
Yes, there is.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.200
You just can't see her.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.640
Really?

02:47.640 --> 02:52.280
Yes, I'm afraid she's very, very shy.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.480
I'll leave the door open for you, Minnie.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.320
Come in when you're ready.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.640
She'll get soaked if she stays out there.

02:58.640 --> 03:02.680
Maybe that doesn't matter very much if you're invisible.

03:02.680 --> 03:03.520
Oh.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.320
Tiki, how nice.

03:08.320 --> 03:13.120
What is everyone looking at?

03:13.120 --> 03:23.920
About Minnie, you know sometimes when people are very frightened, they can become invisible

03:23.920 --> 03:26.160
to the people around them.

03:26.160 --> 03:31.720
Poor Minnie, she's looked after by an aunt who doesn't like her and is really horrible

03:31.720 --> 03:35.840
to her and who only does it because she thinks it's her duty.

03:35.840 --> 03:39.560
It wouldn't be so bad if she just got mad and yelled at her.

03:39.560 --> 03:43.040
But she's cold and sarcastic, which is much worse.

03:43.040 --> 03:47.640
She doesn't care if Minnie is unhappy and gives her horrible jobs.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.680
What's sarcastic?

03:49.680 --> 03:51.760
Uh, let's see.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.000
Suppose you tripped and fell over.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.880
What would Moman Mama say?

03:55.880 --> 03:58.760
Well, she does mean if I'd hurt myself.

03:58.760 --> 04:03.640
Yes, well, you're lucky that Moman Mama is so nice, but a lot of people would be mad

04:03.640 --> 04:04.640
at you.

04:04.640 --> 04:09.720
This nasty old lady would say, that may be your idea of dancing, but try not to do it

04:09.720 --> 04:12.040
when people are eaten, please.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.000
Gosh, that's horrible.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.160
Anyway, she just went on being more and more horrible to her so that in the end, Minnie

04:20.160 --> 04:22.680
was so upset she became invisible.

04:22.680 --> 04:27.640
On her answer, she couldn't be bothered to look after little girl she couldn't see.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.480
Poor Minnie.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.480
So she asked me to do it.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.960
Minnie's still outside.

04:33.960 --> 04:38.160
Too nervous to come in.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.360
But what did you do to this old aunt?

04:40.360 --> 04:43.040
I hope you told her she heard Minnie's feelings.

04:43.040 --> 04:47.120
She wouldn't have done any good, not with someone like her.

04:47.120 --> 04:51.920
So I took Minnie home, and then as you're the nicest family I know, I brought her here

04:51.920 --> 04:53.720
so you could make her visible again.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.560
You were very flattered, of course, too, Tiki.

04:56.560 --> 04:57.560
But, uh...

04:57.560 --> 05:02.320
If anyone could do it, you and Moman Mama can, and Moman can play with her.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.240
Because she'd talk at all to Tiki.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.240
I'm afraid not.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.240
Not since she became invisible.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.240
Oh, dear.

05:08.240 --> 05:13.160
I'm sure I can think of lots of games, but it'll be hard to play if I can't see her.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.680
She'll be really good at hiding seat, though.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.160
Oh, it's okay.

05:17.160 --> 05:22.160
You'll know where she is because her aunt hung a little bell around her neck.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.760
Ah, look, the door's opened.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.760
That'll be nanny.

05:33.320 --> 05:35.320
Come here, nanny.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.320
It's all right.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.320
Don't be frightened.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.320
Come and meet everyone.

05:41.320 --> 05:46.320
This is your new home, and this is Moman Mama and Moman Papa.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.320
They're both very nice.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.320
Hello, I'm Moman, and these are my friends.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.320
We were just having some tea.

05:56.320 --> 05:57.320
Would you like some?

05:57.320 --> 06:00.320
Oh, that is, if you can drink.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.320
Oh, perhaps I should make some lemonade.

06:06.320 --> 06:10.320
Well, now, perhaps you'd all like to go back to the table, eh?

06:10.320 --> 06:12.320
If you'd care to sit down, nanny.

06:16.320 --> 06:19.320
I'm sorry I don't know any more about her,

06:19.320 --> 06:23.320
but I'm sure that everything will be okay now she's here.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.320
I'm certain it will.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.320
We'll do our best, Tiki.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.320
Here you are, nanny.

06:37.320 --> 06:41.320
Well, she seems to be okay now, so I better be getting along.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.320
I've got a lot of things to do.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.320
I'll try and come over to see how you're all going.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.320
That would really be nice.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.320
Oh, it's better.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.320
You have got room, haven't you?

06:56.320 --> 06:59.320
Didn't you have someone else stand?

06:59.320 --> 07:00.320
Ah, yes.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.320
A thing I mean, Bob, but it's all right.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.320
They left last week.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.320
That's okay then.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.320
Oh, you must have been thirsty.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.320
Would you like some more?

07:16.320 --> 07:17.320
Sure.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.320
Oh, are you coming up with me?

07:29.320 --> 07:31.320
That's nice, nanny.

07:45.320 --> 07:48.320
This is your very own room.

07:48.320 --> 07:51.320
You'll be warm and cozy here.

07:51.320 --> 07:54.320
I've put the lemonade on the table,

07:54.320 --> 07:58.320
so you can have a drink whenever you want.

07:58.320 --> 08:02.320
Are you sure you wouldn't like something to eat?

08:02.320 --> 08:05.320
Ah, I see, you want to go to bed.

08:05.320 --> 08:09.320
Well, you had a busy day, so you must be tired out.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.320
Don't forget, if you feel frightened or lonely during the night,

08:12.320 --> 08:15.320
just come and wake me up and we'll have a talk.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.320
If you like, you can tinkle your little bell in my ear,

08:18.320 --> 08:21.320
and that should do it, nanny dear.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.320
Sweet dreams. Sleep well.

08:36.320 --> 08:37.320
She asleep?

08:37.320 --> 08:38.320
Yes.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.320
I was wondering whether there's anything that might help her

08:43.320 --> 08:46.320
in your granny's book of household remedies.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.320
I don't know if there's a cure for invisibility.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.320
I can't remember, but I'll have a look.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.320
There's a remedy for most things.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.320
I'm a phone believer in granny's remedy.

08:55.320 --> 08:58.320
I know you are dear. I'll go and see.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.320
I wonder what you looked like.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.320
Ah, there it is.

09:09.320 --> 09:13.320
Now then, a droopy tail, evil eye, melancholy.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.320
Ah, this must be it.

09:18.320 --> 09:23.320
The prescription was at the end of the book,

09:23.320 --> 09:27.320
and shakily written, but it looked like the right one.

09:27.320 --> 09:31.320
It said, remedy for when people start getting misty

09:31.320 --> 09:33.320
and difficult to see.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.320
It was very complicated.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.320
I wonder whether it's the right one.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.320
I wonder whether it's the right one.

09:54.320 --> 09:57.320
I wonder whether it's the right one.

09:57.320 --> 10:00.320
I wonder whether it's the right one.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.320
I wonder whether it's the right one.

10:02.320 --> 10:05.320
Do you think it's going to work, Mama?

10:05.320 --> 10:08.320
Granny's remedies usually do, so don't worry.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.320
Yes, you're right.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.320
I wonder whether we ought to go and wake her up.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.320
Look, you can see many shoes.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.320
Papa! Papa!

10:44.320 --> 10:46.320
Oh, good morning, little my.

10:47.320 --> 10:49.320
Is Ninny up yet?

10:49.320 --> 10:51.320
Yeah, she is.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.320
Where is she? She hasn't eaten yet, has she?

10:54.320 --> 10:57.320
I don't know, and she's probably in the dining room.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.320
Oh, no!

11:06.320 --> 11:08.320
I'm too late!

11:08.320 --> 11:10.320
I'd be quiet, you two.

11:10.320 --> 11:13.320
Ninny's just finishing her breakfast.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.320
Come on, drink it all up.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.320
That's good.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.320
It should start to work in a couple of hours.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.320
Well done, Ninny.

11:23.320 --> 11:26.320
Look, her shoes are floating.

11:26.320 --> 11:29.320
Yeah, and soon we'll be seeing the rest of her.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.320
Ha, they look silly.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.320
I think they're very nice feet.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.320
I know who and Mama's remedies are good,

11:35.320 --> 11:37.320
but I can't see them working that fast.

11:37.320 --> 11:41.320
Anyway, you must look pretty bad if you want to make yourself invisible.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.320
Don't let little my upset you, Ninny.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.320
It's only the way she talks.

11:45.320 --> 11:46.320
She doesn't mean it.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.320
Oh, yes, I do.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.320
I'm bored, Moomin.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.320
Well, what shall we do then, Moomin?

11:52.320 --> 11:54.320
I don't know.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.320
Let's go mushroom picking.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.320
That's boring, I never find any.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.320
Well, I do.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.320
Would you like to come, Ninny?

12:02.320 --> 12:05.320
Good, and we can see who can pick the most, shall we?

12:05.320 --> 12:07.320
They all look the same to me,

12:07.320 --> 12:10.320
so you'll have to tell me which ones are safe to eat.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.320
I'll tell you.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.320
Papa! Papa!

12:29.320 --> 12:32.320
Look, Papa, you can see Ninny's shoes now.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.320
Oh, that's good.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.320
There's not many things Mama's potions won't cure.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.320
Oh, it can't be that.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.320
She only took it a minute ago.

12:40.320 --> 12:43.320
Well, it might be that it works faster if you're completely invisible.

12:43.320 --> 12:46.320
I think it's being away from that horrid out.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.320
Yes, it could be.

12:48.320 --> 12:51.320
Mama, we're taking Ninny mushroom picking.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.320
Have a nice time.

12:53.320 --> 12:55.320
Morning!

12:55.320 --> 12:57.320
Morning!

12:57.320 --> 12:59.320
Hello.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.320
Where's Ninny?

13:10.320 --> 13:12.320
Oh!

13:22.320 --> 13:24.320
Huh!

13:27.320 --> 13:30.320
Wow, what a lot of mushrooms!

13:34.320 --> 13:37.320
You seem to know where to find all the best ones, Ninny.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.320
It's so fair. I haven't gotten half as many.

13:42.320 --> 13:45.320
How are you doing, Momen?

13:45.320 --> 13:50.320
Wow, that must be about four times as many as I've got.

13:50.320 --> 13:53.320
Uh, yeah, that's right.

13:53.320 --> 13:56.320
You've never picked that many before.

13:56.320 --> 14:00.320
You know, Momen, I think there's something fishy about this.

14:03.320 --> 14:06.320
Uh-huh, so they're not yours at all.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.320
Well, not really, no.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.320
Ninny's enjoyed herself.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.320
I bet her yucky old aunt never let her go mushroom picking.

14:15.320 --> 14:19.320
She was probably only allowed to carry the baskets, the really heavy ones.

14:19.320 --> 14:22.320
Oh, how awful for her.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.320
They're stinky.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.320
What's he up to now?

14:30.320 --> 14:32.320
I'll take care of him.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.320
Hello, Momen, long time no see.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.320
Not long enough.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.320
Last time you dipped my swimming shorts in glue.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.320
You know, I thought that was very funny.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.320
Hey, what's that basket floating around up there for?

14:44.320 --> 14:47.320
I don't want to be rude, but mind your own business.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.320
It looks like the Hobgoblins work.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.320
Boy, just think of all the things you could do if you were invisible.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.320
Ninny, I'll carry your basket.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.320
Let's go.

14:55.320 --> 14:58.320
It stinks here.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.320
Hey, you!

15:00.320 --> 15:02.320
Isn't it me a name or just a description?

15:02.320 --> 15:05.320
What's wrong? Is your voice invisible, too?

15:05.320 --> 15:07.320
Please stop it, stinky.

15:07.320 --> 15:09.320
Can't you see you're frightening her?

15:09.320 --> 15:11.320
Oh, it's a girl, is it?

15:11.320 --> 15:13.320
Why doesn't she speak for herself?

15:13.320 --> 15:16.320
She's stupid. What a perfect name for her, Ninny.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.320
Now look, stinky.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.320
Oh, yes, Momen. Now look what?

15:20.320 --> 15:24.320
You stop upsetting Ninny or I'll get really angry.

15:24.320 --> 15:27.320
Without those feet, she'd be perfect for a back robbery.

15:27.320 --> 15:31.320
Well, she's getting visible again, so she'll be no good to you at all, stinky.

15:31.320 --> 15:36.320
You couldn't see any of her yesterday, not even the feet.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.320
They're disappearing again.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.320
You have to do a scare of it.

15:41.320 --> 15:44.320
Oh, see? She's gone.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.320
It's all your fault, stinky.

15:47.320 --> 15:51.320
Yes, and like I told you before, she'd make a brilliant back robbery.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.320
Don't you agree? Perfect.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.320
Ninny would never do such a thing as that.

15:57.320 --> 16:00.320
And anyway, Mama's given her one of Granny's magic remedies.

16:00.320 --> 16:03.320
She'll soon be visible again, so they're there.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.320
Whose basket is this?

16:13.320 --> 16:15.320
Mine in little mice.

16:15.320 --> 16:18.320
Well, there's not many of them, but they certainly are pretty.

16:18.320 --> 16:23.320
There weren't many left for us to get, because Ninny has picked them all.

16:23.320 --> 16:26.320
It doesn't really matter how many you've got because you can't eat them.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.320
Let me show you.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.320
Now, this is deadly, tufted toadstool.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.320
And this is cow's bane.

16:33.320 --> 16:37.320
You must remember what they look like.

16:37.320 --> 16:40.320
Ah, these are movements and sniff, I should think.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.320
We didn't pick any poisoners once.

16:42.320 --> 16:47.320
Not quite as many as snorkemaiden and little mice, but this is body fly bane

16:47.320 --> 16:49.320
and insiduous pepper spunk.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.320
And you've both got cow's bane, too.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.320
You must be more careful.

16:53.320 --> 16:54.320
Now, this is better.

16:54.320 --> 16:57.320
There's not one mushroom in here that you can't eat.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.320
How did Ninny manage to do this all on her own?

17:00.320 --> 17:02.320
What a very clever girl she is.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.320
Ninny, where are you?

17:04.320 --> 17:06.320
Come here a minute.

17:06.320 --> 17:07.320
Ninny, didn't you hear?

17:07.320 --> 17:09.320
Mama wants you.

17:12.320 --> 17:15.320
Ninny, this is a beautiful mushroom basket.

17:15.320 --> 17:17.320
We'll have a feast tonight.

17:19.320 --> 17:21.320
Her feet have come back.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.320
Oh, I'm so glad.

17:24.320 --> 17:26.320
We'll soon be able to see your face.

17:26.320 --> 17:28.320
It won't take long at all, Ninny.

17:28.320 --> 17:30.320
And you mustn't worry about stinky one little bit.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.320
He's all talk.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.320
If something upsets you, just think of something else.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.320
At least that's my philosophy in life.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.320
If somebody upsets you, ignore him.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.320
That's my philosophy, Ninny.

17:43.320 --> 17:46.320
Anyone who picks mushrooms like this deserves to be seen.

17:46.320 --> 17:49.320
You mustn't let anything frighten you when you're with us.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.320
Do you understand?

17:54.320 --> 17:57.320
Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.320
That's just great, Ninny.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.320
Oh, that's wonderful, Ninny.

18:01.320 --> 18:02.320
Wonderful.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.320
I can't wait to see all of you.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.320
It won't be long now.

18:06.320 --> 18:09.320
But I don't think Mouse Gray is quite your color, you know.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.320
You just sleep as long as you like, Ninny.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.320
Good night now.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.320
If you want anything, you just shout.

18:49.320 --> 18:52.320
Oh, where's Mom and Mama?

19:19.320 --> 19:24.320
Well, well, what are you doing?

19:24.320 --> 19:27.320
I mean, do you know what time it is?

19:27.320 --> 19:29.320
Do you like this moment, Papa?

19:29.320 --> 19:30.320
Hmm.

19:30.320 --> 19:33.320
Yes, it's very nice.

19:33.320 --> 19:36.320
It's good to have someone in the house to make clothes for it last.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.320
I hope it'll look pretty on her.

19:38.320 --> 19:39.320
What's this for?

19:39.320 --> 19:40.320
Her hair.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.320
praise.

19:56.320 --> 20:13.320
ok

20:13.320 --> 20:15.320
Good morning mum and Papa.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.320
Good morning little Mai.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.320
You're very early today.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.320
You're a burly?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.320
I can't wait to see her.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.320
Come on, man.

20:29.320 --> 20:32.320
It's like waiting for Christmas, isn't it?

20:32.320 --> 20:35.320
Yeah, I like having presents every day.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.320
Isn't it, Papa?

20:37.320 --> 20:40.320
Well, I think it's much more exciting this way.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.320
We have to wait until she's ready to come down.

20:43.320 --> 20:46.320
Did you hear that door opening?

20:46.320 --> 20:48.320
She's awake!

20:50.320 --> 20:53.320
I hope she found the dress where I left it on the table.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.320
Oh, good.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.320
It's all right.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.320
Now, you know where to look.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.320
Well, it's time to go to bed.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.320
Oh, good.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.320
It's all right.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.320
Now, you know where to look.

21:19.320 --> 21:23.320
Well, she's OK, I suppose.

21:29.320 --> 21:33.320
Thank you all very much for everything.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.320
Oh.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.320
Ha! So she can talk!

21:41.320 --> 21:43.320
They still couldn't see Nini's face.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.320
But at least they knew that she was there,

21:45.320 --> 21:47.320
that she was talking to them.

21:47.320 --> 21:49.320
I've made them all feel a lot better.

21:49.320 --> 21:51.320
Stork made them. Look!

22:07.320 --> 22:13.320
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the romance.

22:13.320 --> 22:21.320
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:21.320 --> 22:25.320
They're always happy and always at play.

22:25.320 --> 22:29.320
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:29.320 --> 22:33.320
The movements.

22:33.320 --> 22:35.320
The movements.

22:35.320 --> 22:41.320
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

22:43.320 --> 22:51.320
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:51.320 --> 22:55.320
They're always happy and always at play.

22:55.320 --> 22:59.320
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.320
The movements.

23:01.320 --> 23:05.320
The movements.

23:05.320 --> 23:11.320
The movements.

23:13.320 --> 23:17.320
The movements.
