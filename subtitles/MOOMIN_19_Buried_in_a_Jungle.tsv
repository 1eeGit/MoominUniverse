101620	123620	had grown into a tropical forest it was beautiful but also dangerous with man-eating plants kept a bay by snuffkin playing as harmonica but for how long
124620	139620	oh dear snuffkin don't stop playing your harmonica whatever you do they'll only get angry and attack us all over again
139620	145620	if I don't stop soon I might never want to play again
145620	155620	well perhaps the music has made them more friendly be careful mr. himmelon oh don't worry

255620	261620	I feel sorry for them it can't be helped snuffkin if we let them out will be eaten alive
263620	269620	it makes me feel very uncomfortable having man-eating plants under the floor
269620	273620	always keep a kettle of boiling water handy in case they break through
273620	281620	the children are playing Tarzan they might as well seeing as they've got a jungle to play in
281620	284620	still planting those seeds might have been a terrible mistake
284620	292620	well mama I'm very glad that you did just think what I would have missed and movement valley suddenly being full of tropical plants
292620	298620	is wonderful I'm not fond of traveling as you know and you've brought the plants to me
298620	306620	the trees make it much cooler but those man-eaters who I could do without them
