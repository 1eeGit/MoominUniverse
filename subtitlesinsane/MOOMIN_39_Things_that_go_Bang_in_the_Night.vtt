    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're here for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They are the movements.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So what do you think?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:38.640
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:01:06.000
sing that song ever, there were the movements, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement What? What? What?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
What?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
What?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
What?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Big explosions could be heard in Moomin Valley almost every night and

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Moomin couldn't sleep a wink. Usually there was just one, but sometimes even two.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You heard it too, Mom and Papa.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Yes, those loud bangs are kicking me awake.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I wonder if there will be another one.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
They seem to be coming from the north.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Hmm, he's sti-thought.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Or they could be coming from lonely mountains. If you ask me, I believe there is a work from the north. Hmm, he's stifled. Or they could be coming from lonely mountains.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.340
If you ask me, I believe they're the work of the witch.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.180
The witch?

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.680
But witches don't make a lot of noise.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.680
Never know.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.140
They're sneaky characters.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.200
Tomorrow I'll have a few words with the inspector.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.000
Except to him to put a stop to it.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.879
Papa, why would the witch want to make explosions?

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:05.159
Why not?

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.539
The first bang wakes me up and then I lie awake waiting for the second one which might not

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.919
come at all.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.780
The bags might not come from movement value at all and they might be just an echo off

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.780
the mountains.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.780
You think so?

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.780
Yes I do.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.280
Well at least that's what Snuffkin thinks.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.800
I mean the explosions might come from the sea.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.280
That's what Snuffkin figured.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.500
He thought it might be pirates or something

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.500
making the noises.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.000
He's already had pirates and they went a long time ago.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.500
I'm plumping for the witch.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.500
There's no doubt in my mother.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.500
Goodness, what are you doing out here?

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.500
We're waiting for another explosion, mama.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500
You're waiting vain, dear.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500
No, no, no, no, that moment, mama.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500
Well, we had two explosions last night

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.500
and we've never had double explosions

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.000
for two nights in a row.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Until now, that is.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
You heard that. It clearly came from over there.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Over there?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Oh, no. It certainly came from over there.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You couldn't mistake it. I'm sure of it. Good morning, Moon. Lovely day.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Good morning, Snuffkin.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
You look very sleepy.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So would you be opposed explosions that kept you awake for most of the night?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Those explosions are really very hard, aren't they?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
They certainly are. Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Moment, Papa's convinced that she's the one who's going to be the best. Those explosions are really very odd, aren't they? They certainly are. Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Mum and Papa's convinced that she's the one who's making the bangs.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I think he's wrong there.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
That's what I thought, but there's nothing I could say to convince him.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So now I'm going to find out for myself.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
You can certainly ask her, but do you really trust a witch to tell you the truth?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Shhh. Do you the truth?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Do you, a woman? But witches don't have to lie, Shirley.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Is that you, little my?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And where are you two going?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Little my!

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Are you trailing me full time or what?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Yes, whenever you're sneaking off somewhere,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I'm not sneaking, I'm just walking.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Well, I've never seen anyone walking in such a sneaky way.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Last time the witch tried to keep you from waging up, didn't she?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So, so you think now she's trying to keep you from sleeping, eh?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.399
Well, if she makes the explosions, it's always possible that someone else is the target.

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:37.600
We know very little about witches, and those bangs are probably nothing to do with the movements.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.800
I think you guessed right, but try telling that to the movements.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:50.500
We don't think it's like that at all.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.500
Wonder if she's at home. If she is, then we can visit Alicia instead.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.300
Better ask Alicia than the witch.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.600
Anyway, she's more likely to tell us the truth.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600
Yes, you're right.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.000
Uh-oh. Oh, oh, oh. Look, you don't seem to realize this is a witch's house.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
What do you mean by that?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I'll tell you what I mean.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
What I mean is, I don't want to be seen talking

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
with goodie-goodies like the moments.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
You think they'll ruin your reputation

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
is that why you're so worried?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Hmm.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
There's just something very important we wanted to ask you.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I'm not sure if you're so worried? Hmm.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Uh, there's just something very important we wanted to ask you. And then we'll leave straight away.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
That room upstairs, is that Alicia's?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It is. Is Alicia there now?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.680
No, she isn't.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.639
Where did she go?

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.279
She went to get some wolf's pain.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.800
When will she be coming back?

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.800
You're not going to stop her studying.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.600
No.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.199
We wanted to ask her something about that loud noise

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.560
we hear every night.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.079
Ah, that one.

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:02.639
Hey, are you the one making the bangs?

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.240
I don't make explosions.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.540
Who is it then?

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.939
I really don't know.

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:08.899
But why did you say that one then?

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:12.639
Because the explosions bother me too.

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.180
You think they're coming from near here?

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.220
I think they're coming from far away from the sea, maybe.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.279
That's what's not can things do.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:22.560
Any sound from the sea echoes off Lonely Mountain,

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.459
so you think that's where it comes from?

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:29.920
Why is young man? A few days ago I went all the way over to the beach to see what was happening.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.959
After a whole day's witching and casting magic spells, one needs one sleep, you know.

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:40.000
So what did you find them? Nothing at all. There was only one explosion that night, so when I got

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
there on my brun, there was nothing more to see. Then we still have no idea who makes the bind.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
No, and I really upset you thought it was me.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
When a witch creates an explosion,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
it doesn't sound anything like a camel cough.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I can tell you.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Camel cough, I like that.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:17.139
Ha ha ha ha ha! Thank you very much, Snork Maiden.

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:19.779
This year I want to grow some black tulips.

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:21.740
Is there really such a thing as a black tulip?

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.379
There's such a dark red, they look black.

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:26.000
Oh, I see.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Although it wouldn't really surprise me Snort Maiden if they're really

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
were black when somewhere.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We must ask the hamuline you'll know.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Oh yes.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I know it's embarrassing but I'm so excited I can't go to sleep at night.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Oh I have no problem going to sleep at night but that noise wakes me up

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
hamuline.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.959
What noise is that? I told you that noise.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:50.240
Oh, I see. You're talking about the explosion.

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:52.959
You know anything about it, Mr. Himmela.

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:54.600
No, nothing at all.

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:57.720
No, those bangs are not what keeps me awake,

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.720
moment, Papa.

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:02.560
No, I'm waiting for a pie from the buttonest federation.

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:03.920
Reply.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.000
Yes, don't you remember a few months ago?

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:14.319
Housecrange I thought I told you about it. Well, I certainly told everyone else I know. I sent them a brand new species.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:22.319
New species. I've never seen anything like it in my whole life. A new wild orchid. I'm so excited I can hardly speak.

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:26.800
Really? A new wild orchid, how very interesting.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.000
Yes, isn't it?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Oh, it would be such a great honor for me and for everyone else

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.399
if they called it Orchidaka emulences or emula formus.

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:36.000
No, I'm sure they will.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
So now you understand why I've had so many sleepless nights.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.600
Yes indeed.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.000
Trouble is they should have answered by now.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.039
Maybe they're still trying to decide what to call it.

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:50.440
Maybe they can't decide between Orkidaka Hemulences

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.679
and Orkidaka Hemila Formis.

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:53.879
Mmm.

00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:55.519
Oh.

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:57.039
Motorzard.

00:08:57.039 --> 00:09:00.159
Now I see, at last I understand.

00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:02.840
I am getting no reply from the botanist federation

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.000
because it is not a new species.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Oh, of course, somebody's already found it.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Oh, it's just real funny.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
No, no, no, no, stupid I am.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
This is the end of me as a scientist of course.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Calm down, don't upset yourself, Mr. Himmiel.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Everybody will laugh at me and call me Mr. Hemmuellences!

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Now listen, Mr. Hemmuellen, the reply is a long time coming because they must examine your plant most carefully before making a decision.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
They must read all the books first to be sure.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
You really think so, Mum and Patna?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Could it really take so long, do you think?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Of course, these things take time.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
When did you send it all?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
A month ago.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Well, there you are. That's no time at all.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
You have to learn to be patient, Emile.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
You think so?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Oh, I feel better already.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Oh, I'm so glad you feel happier, Mr. Emile.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And don't you worry, my friend.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.879
Mama, great news, dear.

00:10:06.879 --> 00:10:09.159
Mr. Hemmulan's discovered a completely new plant

00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:11.759
and is going to be called Hemmulansees.

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:14.320
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.519
Congratulations, Mr. Hemmulan.

00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:18.759
Oh, well, it isn't official yet, you know.

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:21.399
Oh, they're just thinking about the name still.

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:22.559
Give them time.

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:24.639
We should have a party for Mr. Hemmulan.

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:25.840
Shouldn't we, Papa?

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.919
What?

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:28.840
Oh, yes indeed.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.840
When Papa tonight?

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.120
Hmm, let me think.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.200
We should wait just a little bit longer perhaps.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.960
Oh, why do you say that?

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.440
Mr. Himmielin, you know that rare plant you found?

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.080
Does it have any flowers?

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.399
But of course.

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:45.000
Are they pretty?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Very pretty.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Yes, just like you, Snork Maiden.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Oh, Mr. Amulin.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Oh!

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Hey, look, Snorkkin, why don't we go and find out about those explosions tonight, huh?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
All right.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.039
You'll need me to find the way.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:08.399
You want to come along?

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:09.360
You bet.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:10.960
They come later tonight.

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:12.840
I won't go to sleep, Ben.

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:14.759
What do you think, Snuffkin?

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.960
I'm not sure. Isn't there anything you can do to change your mind, movement?

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.919
I don't know.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.279
Listen, little Monk, you have to be careful.

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:22.679
This could be dangerous.

00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:26.240
Obviously, or I wouldn't come, would I? It's well, my sleep. Well, stick close to us then. This could be janglerous. Obviously, or I wouldn't come. Would I, as well, my sleep?

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.840
Well, stick close to us then.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.720
Yes, do that.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.960
I also went down to the beach late last night

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.960
to try and find out what was happening.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.360
And while I was there, I saw the witch flying around

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.679
on her broomstick.

00:11:36.679 --> 00:11:37.559
Oh, really?

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:39.759
Why didn't you tell me so I could have come along?

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:42.559
I could hide better than you. You're so white.

00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:45.600
See, movement? I'm not big in way like you.

00:11:47.299 --> 00:11:48.799
Oh, there's someone coming.

00:11:48.799 --> 00:11:49.799
Who?

00:11:53.799 --> 00:11:54.799
It's Alicia.

00:11:54.799 --> 00:11:56.399
Hi, Alicia!

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:57.799
Hi, Alicia!

00:11:58.799 --> 00:12:00.399
Oh, my man!

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.200
Hello, Alicia.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.000
How are you?

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Have you three come here to play with me? No, I'm afraid we have it, but it's good to see you.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Yes, Alicia.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Yes?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Has your grandmother been kind to you since your last visit to us?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Very kind.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
She's been treating me very well.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Ever since I stopped coming to see you.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Oh, good, but we do miss you, Alicia.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Oh, I miss you too, but I must keep my promise to her.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
She'd be upset if I broke it.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
What are these weeds?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
They're herbs.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Herbs are very important for a witch.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And frogs, bellies, and lizard stales, they're important too, of course.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
I think that's licorice.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
That's right. Very clever, Snuffkin.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
We use that for heartburn and coughs.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
The taste smells quite nice.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And it also stops cows from giving their milk.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I see. That's interesting.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Hey! Oh, it's a ride!

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Hello, Mr. Hillman splendid days. Hello, Mr. Hemmielin.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Thought you worked so hard.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Yeah, I guess I do with that.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Wait, stop.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
What is it, Mr. Hemmullen?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
My letter. I just want my letter.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
There isn't one.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
But why not? You didn't have any yesterday or the day before.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Yeah, I know that. Nobody's written to you. That's why.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Well, somebody should have written. Are you quite, quite sure that you've gone through your bag properly?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.600
Don't you know I'm expecting an important letter from an important scientist?

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.000
It must be in your bag.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.600
Ah, alright then, go ahead.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.840
Well, he don't seem to trust me to do my job properly, Mr. Hemuellen.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.399
Go ahead, have a look for yourself then.

00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:01.200
Oh, but of course I trust you. Sorry.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.200
No, no, you better have a look.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.960
What do you think I do? Steam them open and read them at night?

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.200
No.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.600
Oh, you seem to have a lot of letters today.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.559
Oh, I really think I should ask for a higher salary.

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:17.840
I deserve it.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.440
Ah!

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.679
I'm just starving.

00:14:22.679 --> 00:14:25.480
I might have to go over and visit the moments in a minute.

00:14:33.919 --> 00:14:36.519
I'm sleepy too. I could go on sleeping.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.519
What do you think you're doing? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:45.000
Hmm? There's nothing else out sorry. I didn't see you there.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Hmm? There's nothing else out here and you didn't see me?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I'm sorry.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Oh dear. What has this matter with you?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Is this place called Moomin Valley?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Yes. That's right.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
At last I found it. I never thought I'd really make it.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Excuse me? Are you all right?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Doctor me, miss?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Oh, tell me what's bothering you.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Huh?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Oh, she's ill.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
She's got a fever.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Please leave me alone.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
But you can lie here.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
You should be in bed, young lady.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Do you know a man called Hamilton?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Yes.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Have you walked all the way to Moment Valley to visit him?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
So I have come to the right place. It does live here.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Oh yes, he lives very close to here.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
I'm so glad I must see him immediately here.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Oh, what shall I do? I must do something. Come here, someone! Someone help me!

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Oh my goodness.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Help!

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Anyone help!

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Help me somebody!

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Papa!

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
He's up in the guest room if you want him. Mama's there as well.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
What for?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I just rescued a girl, you know.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
A girl?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Did you sniff?

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
That's right. Very pretty too. She's ill and I put her to bed myself.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
I'm going to see her. Me too.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I want another look as well.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
First, we must bring her fever down.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
I think you're right.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Yes?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Sniff just told us about her.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Oh dear, she unconscious.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Yes. Where'd she come from?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
We don't know a little, Maya, but Sniff said she'd come here to visit the hemeland.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.240
That's right, and Snort Maiden's gone to get him.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.000
She's pretty, isn't she?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.639
You're right, very.

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:53.919
By the way, Moomin, what do you think?

00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:57.639
Oh dear, must I really run like this?

00:16:57.639 --> 00:17:00.320
Oh, what a sophisticated young girl!

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.440
Well, if she's sick, why don't you give her some medicine?

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.000
I don't know any young girl's apart from her.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Don't tell them. Just keep running.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I told you I do not know this person. Maybe she's changed.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I've already told you. I have never known any young girls.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.599
Then why do you think she'd want to come to visit you, Hamulin?

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.500
She's a botanist.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.940
And obviously she's heard of me and wants to come

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.400
and see the famous Hamulin for herself.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.079
Oh dear, she can tell us when she wakes up.

00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:38.039
We must leave her now so that grandma's medicine can work.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.000
I think I'll be getting home. Oh, we couldn't let you go just like that. Please stay and have some tea with us.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Thank you, but no, I have some plans to press.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
And you're sure you're quite sure you don't know this girl?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Absolutely certain.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
I really must go.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
I'd forgotten all about the bangs.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Well, we haven't snuffed Ken and I.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.339
You're gonna look for them tonight. I'd forgotten all about the bangs.

00:18:06.339 --> 00:18:08.099
Well, we haven't snuffed Ken and I.

00:18:08.099 --> 00:18:09.579
I'm gonna look for them tonight.

00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:12.220
Well, I'd like to come too, but I can't.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.920
I'm going with them.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.259
Are you snorkemaiden?

00:18:15.259 --> 00:18:17.859
You'll be hiding on the beach in the middle of the night?

00:18:17.859 --> 00:18:18.700
Yes.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.700
And then we'll rush off to where the bangs are coming from

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.140
as soon as we hear them.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.299
That's the plan.

00:18:23.299 --> 00:18:25.000
Oh, I'd really love to come.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
I'd rather go to bed.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
I'd be a bit scared of the beach in the middle of the night.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
After all, it's my duty to stay here with Mum and Mama.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Are you coming, Sniff?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Certainly not. Not me.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
It just occurred to me that's why she's here.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Oh. It's just a curtain to me, that's why she's here. Ah.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Here, you better take this moment, you might get very hungry. Oh, thank you, Mama.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
A midnight snack, I really envy you.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.720
Well, Grandpa, why don't you come with us?

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.559
Oh, there's nothing I'd love more,

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:11.319
but I'd better not tonight, right, Mama?

00:19:11.319 --> 00:19:13.440
Oh, definitely not.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.799
What would I do if something happened to the girl

00:19:15.799 --> 00:19:16.720
while you were away?

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.839
Exactly.

00:19:17.839 --> 00:19:18.839
All right, Papa.

00:19:18.839 --> 00:19:21.359
We'll find out about the bangs for you.

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:29.000
Thank you, Momenta.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Ah. Ah.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.400
Good.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.400
I think we should save this food for a while.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.200
We might have to wait a long time for the explosions.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.599
And they might not come tonight.

00:19:40.599 --> 00:19:42.400
Stop stuffing yourself, Momenta.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.900
The rest is for snuffkin and me.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.500
But you can't eat anymore?

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.700
Yes, I can.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.700
We must share it in equal parts, otherwise it's not fair.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:20:22.700
I think it should be shared in proportion to how big one is. Oh

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
From the sea keep a sharp lookout! Look over there!

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
What is it?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Uh-oh!

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Wow!

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
That's what I call fireworks!

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.039
Come on! Somebody must be out there in a boat

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:06.000
There's a boat the fireworks must have come from there. Hey, come ashore!

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Is that the hemuline you think?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
No, I don't think so.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
It looks like him, but he was much younger.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
And so as a result of their excursion to the beach,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
they finally learned that the big bangs that had been

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
waking everyone up were fireworks.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
They also learned that the fireworks were coming from a

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
boat far out to sea,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:46.000
but the man who had sent them up disappeared into the night. Leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
They're always happy and goes at play

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
The movements are having fun day after day

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:07.000
The movements, the movements, the movements The Moons
