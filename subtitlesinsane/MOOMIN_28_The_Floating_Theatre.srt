1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Therefore you on your TV they are the movements.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So what do you think?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think it's a good idea. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:01:19,920
sing that song ever, there were the movements, there was the moments One day in Newman Valley, not long before midsummer on a perfectly ordinary day, Snuffkin suddenly

10
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,560
announced that he was going on a short trip.

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,640
Where are you going, Snuffkin?

12
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,200
Well, not very far.

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll be back right after mid-summer.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,120
Oh, but Snuffkin, you missed the bonfire at the big party.

15
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,319
But why in the world are you going away?

16
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,840
There's something I've been dying to do for a long time,

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,400
and it has to be done on mid-summer eve.

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,959
I promise to tell you all about it,

19
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,379
moment, as soon as I'm back in movement valley.

20
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,420
Little did Snuffkin know that before he came back,

21
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,620
the underwater volcano, which had kept quiet ever since

22
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:24,800
movement pop as youth, would wake up again. I don't think I like this.

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,000
I think it's exciting.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
In that case, you can have it.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The woman mama.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes, what is it, dear?

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The hammock is shaking.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's very unpleasant.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think it's that volcano you told us about.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes, I guess it must be.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Mama!

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Papa!

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh!

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,039
They're smocked. Rising from the street, Papa. I guess it must be. Mama! Papa! Oh!

35
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,800
There's smoke rising for the city, Papa!

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,639
Smoke!

37
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,639
Oh!

38
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,639
Oh!

39
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,639
Oh!

40
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,639
Oh!

41
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,639
Oh!

42
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,639
Oh!

43
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,639
Oh!

44
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,639
That's very awesome.

45
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,639
What is it, Papa?

46
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,639
That's easy!

47
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,639
What's going on?

48
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,639
I don't know, really.

49
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,639
I guess they're all over the place.

50
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,639
Oh!

51
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,639
Oh!

52
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh! That's very awesome. What is it, Papa? Let me see! What's your action quite? Get a pound of eruption!

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What's going on?

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't know really. I guess there isn't much we can do.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hey!

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I can't see.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Where is it?

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let me see now. It's my turn.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Now I'm at first!

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes, now I've got it.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let me see! No, I'm three. Let me see!

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, I'm first.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Moving purple would be worth quakes as big in your youth.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No, they certainly weren't.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And this one's underwater.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, my net goes a tide of wolf.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
A tide of wolf.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh my goodness, it never saw that.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hey, what's your turn?

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Snatch me the net.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What do you doing? Snatch me, lad.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What do you think?

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Can you see anything unusual, woman, papa?

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I've never seen anything like it.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is very unusual.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh, my!

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I want to see it too!

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Come on, I can't stand it!

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
How can you fight during a catastrophe?

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Whatever you do, don't!

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Get the test off!

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We need to Oh! Oh!

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh!

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh!

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh!

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh!

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh!

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh!

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're so stupid.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You should have let me have it first.

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's all your fault, little my.

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Anyone can see that.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
How dare you say it was all my fault.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It doesn't mean we didn't get it.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's all the whole way.

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh. How dare you say it was all my fault because it was you! Oh!

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Snork maiden? Yes?

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm standing watch over my flying ship,

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
so why don't you stay over in Moomin House?

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You'd be careful!

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You look after her once you move in, Poppos?

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Certainly, Snork.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't like the look of things.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No, do I.

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No, do I.

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We better get inside moment house quickly.

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Everybody have a good time.

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's scary.

109
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Your head and your earthquakes are getting out of here. The Go, go, go, go, go! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, my God.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, my God.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, my God.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, my God.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh, my God.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh, my God.

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, my God.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh, my God.

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh, my God.

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What's that noise? Listen, can you hear? Huh? A noise? What noise?

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't know.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sounds like water to me.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh no!

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What's happened?

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The movement house is drifted off to sea!

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh no!

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What's happening?

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What's happening?

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What's happening?

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What's happening?

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What's happening?

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What's happening?

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What's happening?

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What's happening?

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What's happening?

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What's happening?

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What's happening?

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What's happening? What's happening? What's happening? What's happening? What's happening? Sounds like water to me. Oh no!

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What's happened?

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The moving house is drifted off to sea!

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't believe this.

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I think movement valley is flooded.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It really is.

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What's happened to the kitchen and dining room?

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Just goes I fear.

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What are we going to do?

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Mum and Mum can't even prepare breakfast down there.

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh, good morning. You're up early today.

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Mama, Mum and House is flooded.

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
All of Mum and Fala, here's under water.

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh dear, I think you're right, Mum.

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's poppies still asleep.

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Let's go and wake him up. He definitely wouldn't want missed it. Oh dear, I think your right, movement is poppin' still asleep.

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's go and wake him up, he definitely wouldn't want missed it.

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Boy, I'm sleepy.

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm even sleepy.

156
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I didn't sleep a wink because he was snoring.

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Little my was snoring so hard, the whole bed was shaking.

158
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm gonna have a nap soon as I've had something to eat.

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hey, snap!

160
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What's this?

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Where am I? What's happened here?

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Woman house is flooded, Smith!

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, pop! This means I'll have to swim to get home!

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You'll have to dive to get into your house!

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hmm, unless I'm mistaken, the water is still rising!

166
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Mom and Papa, you gotta do something! Do something right away!

167
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I think you better start taking swimming lessons.

168
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,519
And don't worry, Sniff.

169
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,519
I'll start organizing.

170
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,519
What do you want organized, Mumma?

171
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,879
Well, dear, I guess we should have

172
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,480
some breakfast first of all.

173
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,639
Yes.

174
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,839
But how do we get into the kitchen, Papa?

175
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,839
You just leave that to me.

176
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:12,319
There, your kitchen. I've never seen it from above before. Oh, my goodness. People

177
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:18,579
should look at their rooms from above once in a while. Look, cars of food floating from

178
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:25,839
the cellar. What luck we have a trap door. My my shall I dive in and get them? Yes, please, Moomin.

179
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,759
Be careful, Moomin.

180
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,399
It's gotta be done.

181
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,879
Hurry up, Moomin.

182
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,679
I'm hungry.

183
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,679
Oh.

184
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:47,000
Ugh. Can you get us some bows and plates this time? Sure. And indeed, the water was still rising.

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's coming! It's coming!

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Help!

187
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The water's up to the third floor.

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The third floor is up to the third floor.

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The third floor is up to the third floor.

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The third floor is up to the third floor.

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The third floor is up to the third floor. The third floor is up to the third floor. And indeed the water was still rising. It's coming! It's coming! Help!

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The water's up to the third floor!

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What are we gonna do, Mom and Papa? Where's Mom and Papa?

194
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He's up on the roof, Smith, with the others.

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What are they doing up on the roof?

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Ah, there goes another poorly built house.

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Why doesn't our house float away, Papa?

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's all very simple, dear son. I built it myself.

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
If you hadn't, maybe we wouldn't be about to sink altogether.

200
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Here we are.

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Are you coming to help me, everybody?

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
This is one of Grandma's best plates. So please be extra careful.

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I know. But where do you think we're going, Mom?

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Something will float by. Big enough to take all of us. We just have to wait.

205
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm not gonna wait for that. I think this family's out in touch with reality.

206
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Something big enough will float by indeed.

207
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm gonna see my old skin while I'm still tired.

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This is something I should have done immediately, but it's not too late.

209
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Look! There's a whole house drifting by!

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Oh, you're right. It's very odd looking house though.

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yes, it does look funny, but I think we better take it.

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hmm, that's the one we're getting. Yeah. So who will be the real great one?

213
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, I'm stopping with you.

214
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't leave me behind.

215
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Where's that house?

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Right over there.

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Just there.

218
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Catch us, see it, Snapp.

219
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Oh, that house.

220
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What?

221
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You call that a house?

222
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh...

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Hurry up, Sniff! What are you doing? I just changed my mind! That one looks like it's going to sink!

224
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,440
No, it's fine! We're all aboard. Come on.

225
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,639
I don't believe you. Soon as I'm aboard, it'll sink. I'm feeling.

226
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,639
He's scared of his own shadow. Let's leave him. Move any such a whimp.

227
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,559
Come on. It's all right.

228
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,639
Now, don't worry about me. You can let go of the ladder. I'm fine.

229
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,779
Stay behind if you like, Sniff.

230
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,559
Look what about your breakfast?

231
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,000
Uh-oh. We have all the food here and you might get hungry. Stay behind if you like Sniff, but what about your breakfast?

232
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We have all the food here and you might get hungry and if you do, there'll be nothing to eat.

233
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Why didn't you say so before?

234
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And now hold the ladder steady, and I don't want to be abandoned.

235
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:49,000
No, brother, he's coulda made kinga know what is it he actually ever followed. I'm falling on it!

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm falling on it!

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't do this to me!

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't shake it!

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Don't shake it!

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't shake it!

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Hold it steady!

242
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Excuse us!

243
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Hello!

244
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Anybody home?

245
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't worry, we're not dangerous.

246
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Isn't breakfast ready yet? I'm starving to death.

247
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There's no one here, Papa.

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I think you're right, it certainly seems empty.

249
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, and the most exciting empty house I've ever seen.

250
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,720
Why do you say that? What do you mean exciting? Do you mean interesting or do you mean scary little my?

251
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,399
Interesting and scary looks Norgmaiden look around

252
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:38,559
What a lot of mirrors this house must have been full of women who loved glow or maybe just one woman

253
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,519
Snorkmaiden who had as many faces as there are mirrors in this room

254
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,840
Look every mirror has a chair in front of it,

255
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,320
place just like so.

256
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,039
This house was full of ladies

257
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,799
and he chatted her a little mirror.

258
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,600
Thank goodness we brought some plates with us.

259
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,759
Woman, mama, woman, woman! Look what I found!

260
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,919
Bread naples!

261
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,039
How nice, sniff!

262
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,919
Now we can have a real breakfast.

263
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,960
But where is everybody?

264
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,620
Well, I don't know.

265
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,919
Somewhere around.

266
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,480
Whoever lived here must have had a lot of strange hobbies.

267
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,000
You're so right.

268
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Hey, who said that?

269
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Wow, look at that cog wheel.

270
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The snorke would love that.

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I wonder what Moonman will say about this little mind?

272
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm sure he'll say you look better without anything.

273
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
One look at you and he won't even notice anything else.

274
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well, if he has any sense, he will fall for me like a ton of bricks.

275
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You want about breakfast, woman, mama?

276
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We'll have breakfast as soon as we are all here.

277
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I wonder where they can all be.

278
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You know, it's very bad for me to go hungry.

279
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I always feel unwell if I don't eat.

280
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
All right, sniff. You go ahead.

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But mind you don't eat all the apples.

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Leave some for the others, won't you?

283
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh, don't worry, of course I will, mom and mama.

284
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

285
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

286
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

287
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

288
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

289
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

290
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Oh, but where on earth did you find them Smith? We need a fruitful.

291
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But no one will trick the play on people making false fruit.

292
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I very upset.

293
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Oh, this is not bread.

294
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh.

295
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Ow, ow, ow.

296
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Who could have done such a cruel thing to me?

297
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Somebody with a very art sense of humor, I'd say.

298
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Somebody without anything!

299
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Have some cheese instead, that at least comes from moving valley.

300
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And it looks delicious.

301
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Whatever these levers for.

302
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Uh-huh.

303
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What's that hear you sound?

304
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's creepy.

305
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Get you here and it sounds like a new earthquake.

306
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yes, I can hear it.

307
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's scary and spooky and creepy.

308
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
All you need to stride on me on my mind.

309
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, I wonder what it can be.

310
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's very strange indeed.

311
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I just don't think I can take another earthquake right now, moment.

312
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah?

313
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh my goodness. Oh, look. What is it, sniff?

314
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Last moment, Bob, a lot!

315
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Why? Our table is gone.

316
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
This is a haunted mansion, moment, moment.

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Well, they can't take grandma's plates just like that.

318
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You can have them laid back, but I'll keep the cheese.

319
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
I like that. You can have them laid back, but I'll keep the cheese. I like cheese.

320
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
This is a good cheese, Dad.

321
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,759
No, Mama.

322
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,639
Yes, I certainly did.

323
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,840
Better not let our food out of sight.

324
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,639
Let's get out of this house, please, Mama.

325
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,919
Oh, son.

326
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,639
What's happening?

327
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,639
What?

328
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:04,399
Oh, will I be getting out of home?

329
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,000
Eat a lot! I'm sorry. You will have to get out of here, the one!

330
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What?

331
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What?

332
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What?

333
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What?

334
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What?

335
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What?

336
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Ah! Oh, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

337
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm so happy.

338
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm so happy.

339
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm so happy.

340
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Papa, was it the witch who was laughing?

341
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
No.

342
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The left is coming from that ugly one.

343
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm so happy.

344
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Behind there.

345
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm so happy.

346
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm so happy. I'm so happy. You're behind there.

347
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Did I hear someone call me an ugly thing just now? Oh, excuse us, Madam. You must be the owner of this house.

348
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No.

349
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh?

350
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Indeed I am not.

351
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Most certainly not. You are greatly mistaken.

352
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
This is no house you fold. This is a theater.

353
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
A theater? Yes.

354
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This is a stage where the heroine receives a standing ovation at the end of the last act.

355
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And the bread and the apples are props.

356
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And the rumour you were playing is where the actors make themselves up to become totally different people.

357
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Kings or murderers.

358
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, and you were one of these actors? Ah, actress! You understand less than nothing!

359
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
See this broom here? This is my only prop.

360
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I sweep the dust in this theater.

361
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh, really?

362
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I have wielded this broom for nearly 20 years!

363
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Would nobody to help me?

364
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
20 years I have cleaned this theater beautifully!

365
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
My name is Emma.

366
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,700
Emma! And you? You better remember that this is, beautifully! My name is Emma. Emma!

367
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
And you!

368
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,420
You better remember that this is at the theater.

369
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,059
This is no ordinary house, and it is a great honor for you to be here at all.

370
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,460
That's true.

371
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,299
Does this mean that we can stay here just for a while?

372
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:00,140
Yes, until the actors return.

373
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,140
Today they all came to a low-verset.

374
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,140
Oh, nice!

375
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,000
That's, nice!

376
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That's so nice!

377
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That's really cool.

378
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yes, it certainly is.

379
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We'll try not to bother you with mine.

380
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Come on, let's go!

381
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Let's go!

382
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Come on, let's go!

383
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Come on, let's go!

384
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Come on, let's go!

385
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Come on, let's go!

386
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Come on, let's go!

387
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Come on, let's go!

388
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

389
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Oh, no!

390
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh, no!

391
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh, no!

392
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh, no!

393
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh, no!

394
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Whoa!

395
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What have you done?

396
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Oh, you seem to have hit a tree, so the house has stopped.

397
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
This is a theater not a house!

398
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, it's a rowing tree.

399
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, lovely it looks.

400
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
How nice to have crashed into such a beautiful tree.

401
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's gorgeous!

402
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And that smell.

403
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You know what?

404
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'd like to spend the night in that tree!

405
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Great idea, Moon!

406
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm coming with you!

407
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
How exciting!

408
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You better stay here. You're bound to fall into the water.

409
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Look who's talking! Scary cat!

410
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That looks safe. We could easily spend the night here.

411
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
We better tie the theatre to the tree so it won't drift away.

412
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If that's all right with Emma. Emma, is it all right to tie the theatre to the tree?

413
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,359
Do what you want! As long as you don't damage the theater, dear, here?

414
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,559
All right.

415
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,599
Ha ha ha!

416
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,079
Don't whistle you idiot!

417
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,240
Don't ever whistle in a theater!

418
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,480
That's the worst luck possible!

419
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
How dare you!

420
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Oh.

421
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:52,400
Uh...

422
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,000
This is great snorkemaiden. We can look at the moon.

423
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,400
And the flowers, they smell so good.

424
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,400
What's the matter?

425
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
I hope that snorke's alright.

426
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,000
Don't you worry.

427
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
He was standing guard over a flying ship after all.

428
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:40,000
All you have to do is get on board and fly away. What's going on here?

429
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Huh? Hmm. Ah!

430
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
No, they're trying to destroy the Pampers box.

431
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I've never seen anything like it.

432
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
These people are bunch of vandals!

433
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Ugh! Meanwhile, movement and snork made their fast asleep, blissfully unaware of what was happening.

434
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,500
But what ever will they do, stranded on the treetop.

435
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:39,500
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

436
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:46,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements

437
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
They're always happy and goes at play

438
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The movements are having fun day after day

439
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:17,962
The movements, the movements, the movements The most
