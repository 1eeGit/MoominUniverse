1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Off we go then, Hank is away, he won't have to road too hard, the wind will pick us up soon.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Goodbye, have a good time, everyone.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Goodbye, Snuffkin, now don't forget to shut all the windows if it rains, will you?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Up towards!

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hey! Wait for me, I want to have a good time too!

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hey, wait!

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Look, Snuff is still waving.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
He's a sweet boy.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's keep waving, Moonman, till we're out of sight.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Bye, Snuffkin! Bye, bye!

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Bye!

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No, I'm not waving goodbye, I want to go too!

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Don't eat all the road, Mary Tabo, we're gone!

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's no good shouting little Mai, he can't hear you.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He's giving us a great send-off though, for Snuff, he should have come with us.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Nancy, I'm going off and leaving me here on my own.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Snuffkin, if you wouldn't mind, I think we need some music to send us on our way.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What do you say?

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Are you sure we're on the right course for the island, Papa?

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, the winds with us and the sails are fine.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I bet if we keep this speed up, we'll be there by tomorrow.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well, if the wind stays like this, you could be right.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The wind's not dying down at all.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm surprised, I never thought we'd keep up this speed.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Now make sure you're allergic.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Of course we will be, Papa, if we carry on like this, perhaps we'll see the light from the lighthouse while it's still dark.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, we don't want to hit anything at this speed.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't worry, we're watching.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ah, this is the light.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Papa, the wind's dropped.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, that's strange, it shouldn't happen that quickly.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Do you want us to start rowing, Moomin, Papa?

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No, Snuffkin, I think we'd better get some sleep.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Stupid wind, I really wanted to see the lighthouse at night.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's getting foggy too.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can't even see the stars anymore.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Right, Snuffkin, wake me in two hours and I'll take over.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay, Moomin, Papa.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What's the matter, Little My?

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I thought I heard something.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's coming from over there somewhere.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Can you see anything?

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No, but I can hear it.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's so good eye, and it's getting closer.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Little Moomin, Papa, get up, Moomin!

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Stop it, Little My! What's the matter with you?

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You too, Moomin, quickly, before it's too late!

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What's the matter, Little My?

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I can hear her ship, I can't see it, but it's very close and getting closer.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
A ship? Where?

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Over there, and she's bearing down on us.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Quickly, we don't have much time.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes, by the boobalier right.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We must let them know we're here, a signal.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Right, all hands on deck.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Maybe if we all shout as loud as we can.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Look!

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh!

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Too late for shouting!

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's huge!

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Look out! It's gonna hit us!

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I think Moomin's right, what can we do?

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's too late for anything, just brace ourselves and be ready to swim for it.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Quick, get down, Little My!

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh!

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't believe it!

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Little My!

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Huh?

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's hard, the ship didn't hit us.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh yes, he did!

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What?

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It went straight into our rudder when nothing happened!

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It went right through us!

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Right through us, that's impossible she couldn't have.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I wonder if there was anyone on board that ship.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I can't see any lights.

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I know, Snuffkin, I think it's a ghost ship.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
A ghost ship?

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, there's no wash and no damage to us.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's the only explanation, I think she's right.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
A ghost ship, we've actually seen one.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh dear, oh dear, I need to sit down, all this excitement's too much.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Papa, don't they say that if you see a ghost ship, something terrible is gonna happen to you?

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What happened in the first place to make it become a ghost ship? That's what I wanna know.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, that's just some old sailor's tail, Moomin.

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If it had been a real ship, we'd probably be sinking now.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't you think so, Snuffkin?

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah, I suppose.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's one way of looking at it.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Come on, cheer up you guys, at least it was fun.

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What's the matter?

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Has something happened?

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What are you laughing at?

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What's so funny?

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you going to tell us?

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Why didn't you wake me up, Moomin?

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh!

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, I think we're doing very well.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We're doing very well.

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We're doing very well.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh!

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, I think we're doing very well.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, what a beautiful sky, just look at it.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, the fog is lifting.

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, what's it dozed off?

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Another beautiful day, not a ghost ship in sight.

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The lighthouse.

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey, wake up everybody, the lighthouse.

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I can see the lighthouse we're there.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, the sun shining, we must have slept for hours.

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, there it is.

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is ridiculous.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We've been next to it all night.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We could have gone and slept there.

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I can't wait to go ashore.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
All right, everyone, jump to it.

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Man the old.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There's something strange going on here.

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What is it, Snuffkin?

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm not sure.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Moomin Papa.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Our boat didn't move at all last night, did it?

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No, it doesn't seem to have moved at all.

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So why couldn't we see the light from the lighthouse,

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
even when the fog cleared?

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I can't work it out.

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes, you're right, Snuffkin, it seems very odd.

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We should have seen it.

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Well, perhaps the lighthouse keeper forgot to put it on, Moomin Papa.

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't think so, little Mai.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can't forget a thing like that.

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I suppose it could be broken.

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
There could be lots of reasons for it.

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why don't we hurry up and get ashore,

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and then we can ask the keeper.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Look, there's someone in a boat.

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hmm.

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It looks like he's fishing.

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He know about the lighthouse.

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He probably lives on the island.

142
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's get closer.

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Easy now.

144
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Now, hoi there, good morning.

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Any luck?

146
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Not yet, but it's still early.

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Hmm, yes, quite.

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll ask him straight out.

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Do you know if the lighthouse was working last night?

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't know.

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He said, no, it wasn't.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What did I tell you?

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He forgot to light it.

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, it wasn't only last night.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You'll never see a light in that lighthouse.

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Not even on stormy nights.

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We'll never.

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So what does the keeper do then?

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Nothing.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There is an lighthouse keeper.

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Why?

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm afraid I don't know.

165
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
All I can say is I haven't seen one.

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you live on the island?

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Hey, mister.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You're asking too many questions.

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Who are you?

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm Moment Papa from Moment Valley, and this is my family.

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We've come a long way in order to do some important work here.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
No work on this island.

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No, you better go back home.

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You see, I've come here to research an epic novel about the sea.

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Just turn around and go back.

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're too far from home.

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh, please, wait.

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Shh.

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Dear, don't shout.

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We mustn't scare the fish away.

181
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's go a show and have some breakfast.

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I expect we're all hungry.

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Bunny, pair.

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The old ones lost his marbles.

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The old ones lost his marbles.

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The old ones lost his marbles.

187
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The old ones lost his marbles.

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The old ones lost his marbles.

189
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The old ones lost his marbles.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The old ones lost his marbles.

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Look, Moment Papa. There's a path here leading to the lighthouse.

192
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We'll leave this stuff here and we'll go and explore it first.

193
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Right, to the lighthouse, everyone.

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Up, bow.

195
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Come on!

196
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What's wrong?

197
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Why do you always get so upset when somebody mentions the lighthouse?

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's not your call, sir.

199
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Business boy doesn't concern you at all.

200
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You were like that when I asked you about it before.

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Maybe if you were to tell me, I might be able to understand.

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I could try anyway.

203
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Either talk about something else or keep quiet.

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You understand that?

205
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's so very rocky, I don't think it would work.

206
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What? A garden.

207
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Hello there!

208
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Is there anybody at home?

209
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
There's nobody here.

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That boy was right. It's been empty for ages, I think.

211
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, the door was left unlocked. I know we do it, but most people don't.

212
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Something terrible's happened.

213
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Something terrible! Please, little my, you know I had things like that.

214
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't worry, snort maiden.

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Little my, it's just trying to scare you.

216
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't like hearing about anything horrible.

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Flag your ears then, snort maiden, because I haven't finished yet.

218
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And the next bit's really horrible.

219
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh, well, where have you been finished there?

220
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Well, the lighthouse keeper is still up there.

221
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
He got scurvy and hats and been able to move for months.

222
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And nobody's heard his cries for help.

223
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And with no food, he's almost a skeleton.

224
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If he isn't dead already, he'll be at the top of the stairs, crawling towards his fingers,

225
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
lading and ripped up ribbons and flowers, mouth.

226
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
God, it's endless, mouth.

227
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Shut up, little my.

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's enough.

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It was a good imagination though.

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll let you use it in your book, if you like.

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Come on, tell me what did she say, Moonman?

232
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh, nothing, really. Nothing at all.

233
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Tell me, Moonman, but leave out the bits I wouldn't like.

234
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Where are you going, Papa?

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Well, listen, everyone.

236
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
First, I'm going to get the lamp working.

237
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Then we'll give the place a good clean and then we'll move in.

238
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We'll be the new lighthouse keepers.

239
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And once again, the seas around this island will be safe for ships to navigate in troubled water.

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Come on, Papa!

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Careful, careful.

242
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Touch anything, that's dangerous.

243
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh!

244
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Will Moonman Papa be able to get the light working again?

245
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Where is the lighthouse keeper?

246
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And what could have made him go without locking the door,

247
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
leaving the ships in peril and the seas with no one to guide them away from the rocks?

248
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And who is the mysterious fisherman?

249
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the moments.

250
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

251
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
They're always happy and always at play.

252
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

253
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The movements.

254
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The movements.

255
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

256
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

257
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
They're always happy and always at play.

258
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

259
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The movements.

260
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The movements.

261
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The movements.

262
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Here they are for one and all.

263
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The movements are about to come.

264
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

265
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
They're here for you on your TV.

266
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
They are the movements.

267
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
They are the movements.

268
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So come with me.

269
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Give me your hand.

270
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll take you up to a movement land.

271
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You can fly just like a bird.

272
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Sing that song ever.

273
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
They're with the movements.

274
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
They're with the movements.

275
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
They're with the movements.

276
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
They're with the movements.

277
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
They're with the movements.

278
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:26,840
The movements came to this island to visit a real lighthouse, but when they got there,

279
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:34,840
I found it was completely deserted, no light, and no lighthouse keeper.

280
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Woman Papa is going to try and mend the lamp, and the others are all helping to clean up.

281
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,840
This is it, then. Do you think it's broken, Papa?

282
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:55,840
Well, I'm not sure. I've not had a great deal of experience with this sort of thing.

283
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Look over there, woman. It's the boy and the fisherman from the boat.

284
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,840
They're a bit strange, aren't they?

285
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,840
They must live somewhere here on the island.

286
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,840
Hmm, let's see. Let's see.

287
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Oh, my God.

288
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:28,840
Oh, thank you. Leave it by the door when you haven't quite finished yet.

289
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,840
Well, at least we can see the floor now.

290
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,840
I think the keeper must be lying dead under the dust.

291
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Nobody's cleaned here for a long time, that's for sure.

292
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,840
That probably means the lighthouse lamp hasn't been working for ages either.

293
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,840
I wonder if Papa will be able to fix it.

294
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,840
I wonder if they're going to manage to get the light working all right.

295
00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Well, the lighthouse without a lamp is pretty sad, isn't it?

296
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Come on, light, will you?

297
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,840
Right, I'll give you one last chance.

298
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Then I'm getting the big spanner. Now, you don't know me, but I don't give in easily, especially to machines.

299
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:22,840
Have you thought, brass brain, what will happen tonight if there's a storm and there's a ship out there looking for land or trying to keep off the rocks and there's no light to guide them?

300
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,840
You'll be sorry, Dan, but it'll be too late.

301
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,840
And all I can say is that if the light hasn't been working for some time,

302
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,840
then I'm afraid that there could have been many shipwrecks.

303
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Oh, that's awful.

304
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,840
It would be dangerous to come too close to the island without a light to help you.

305
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,840
I wouldn't be surprised if that ghost ship went one of them.

306
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,840
It all seems very strange, and I wonder what made the lighthouse keeper leave in such a hurry.

307
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,840
Unspeakable horror, please be quiet, little my.

308
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,840
It's obvious.

309
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Close thrown above dishes left unwashed, jigsaw puzzles have finished.

310
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,840
It's an unsolved mystery of the sea, just like the Marie Celeste.

311
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,840
And if you don't understand that, then you're being even stupider.

312
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Then usual.

313
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,840
Oh dear poor man, I wonder what he was like.

314
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,840
He must have been very lonely here on his own.

315
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,840
He scribbled messages over the walls like no side of a ship.

316
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
It's Christmas, another month gone.

317
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,840
I must clean the lamp, and I need to talk to someone.

318
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,840
Oh, well, if he didn't see many ships, at least they could have been many shipwrecks either.

319
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Oh, I hope not Papa.

320
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
That would be one good thing anyway.

321
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Perhaps the sea came and took him on a dark and stormy night, and he was swept out, and no one saw him go.

322
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,840
That's rubbish, little my.

323
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,840
On dark and stormy nights, lighthouse keeper sits safe by a fire drinking hot tea laced with rum.

324
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,840
He might have run out of rum and gone to get more.

325
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,840
Well, I don't think anything terrible happened to him.

326
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,840
He just got more and more lonely and fed up, and then went off and got a girlfriend.

327
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Be careful, snuffkin.

328
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,840
It's very rough and not even, and you don't want to fall into the sea.

329
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,840
I certainly don't.

330
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,840
Now, watch your step. The rocks are very slippery.

331
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,840
Are you alright?

332
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Yes, Lang, so I didn't think they'd be a slippery as all that.

333
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
What's the matter?

334
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
Look over there. There's something moving, but I can't see what it is.

335
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
It's probably a boat.

336
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,840
No, that's what I call a real ship.

337
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,840
It's not a real one.

338
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,840
What do you mean?

339
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,840
It's the ghost ship, the one we saw last night.

340
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,840
You're right. Why isn't it come back snuffkin? What does it want?

341
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,840
I don't know. Perhaps it followed us to the island and for some reason wants to make contact.

342
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Let's go home snuffkin. I don't like this.

343
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,840
What's up?

344
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,840
I'm having a great dream and you can be with me.

345
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Oh, it was horrible. Someone stepped on my face.

346
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
Well, none of us sleep.

347
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,840
We were all asleep. What are you doing?

348
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840
It's very odd.

349
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,840
No, somebody's on my stomach now.

350
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,840
Don't be stupid.

351
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,840
Oh, I have a look snuffkin. There must be something there. Please snuffkin, please.

352
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,840
I can't see any.

353
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
What's that?

354
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,840
What is it?

355
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,840
I don't know yet, movement. I think I can see a pair of feet.

356
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
A pair of feet.

357
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,840
No legs, just feet.

358
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,840
But that means a ghost.

359
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,840
Oh, help! Get it off me! Go away, go away!

360
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Let me at them! Where are they? I'll teach them to spoil my dream!

361
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,840
They're on my face now. Go away, will you?

362
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
Show me it, but no, stamp on it!

363
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
Stop it, move!

364
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
No, it's my foot!

365
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
You go fishing again today?

366
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
No, I'm not.

367
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Oh, do you need me or is it alright if I go and see those people?

368
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,840
In the lighthouse.

369
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
Oh, don't let you want.

370
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Okay, goodbye then.

371
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
You mean this room is really haunted?

372
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
It certainly is.

373
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
But we only saw a pair of feet.

374
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,840
I'll sleep here tonight. Don't worry. I'll protect you.

375
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Are you going to scare it away, Papa?

376
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
Mm-hmm.

377
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840
I can't find any good shells.

378
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
You're me.

379
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
What about this one?

380
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
Oh, yes, that's lovely.

381
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,840
Go on, take it. I don't collect them.

382
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
Who are you?

383
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,840
Well, I'm a ghost, sort of.

384
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
Are you the rat who walked over us last night?

385
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,840
You were lucky I didn't grab you.

386
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
Sorry, it wasn't just me.

387
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
There were a few of us.

388
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
And walk over each other.

389
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
Can I give you a present?

390
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
You can't get around me that easily.

391
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,840
You better show yourselves or you'll be sorry.

392
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,840
It's just me.

393
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,840
The others have all left me and gone off with the ship.

394
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
Ha, so why didn't you go with them?

395
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,840
Oh, I wanted to, but uh, well...

396
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,840
Come on, out with it.

397
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Never got me and left me all of my own and I was frightened.

398
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Well, I can see why they wouldn't want a drippy thing like you around.

399
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
You call yourself a ghost.

400
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,840
No, I'm sorry.

401
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,840
I just can't work out what's wrong with it.

402
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,840
Let's try and see what happens here.

403
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, heavens, oh, my.

404
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Oh, good.

405
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Oh, no, oh, what?

406
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Oh, you were right, papa.

407
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Oh, thank goodness you're here, quick.

408
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,840
Open all the windows, I'm chocky.

409
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:43,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

410
00:25:50,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Mmm, this is great. That soup I've had for ages, Moome and Mama.

411
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
Would you like some more?

412
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,840
Oh, he has, please. Can I have the recipe? I could make some for the fisherman. I know he'd love it.

413
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
I'll write it out for you. What's his name?

414
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,840
I don't know. He doesn't say. I've come from the north. I left about three months ago.

415
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,840
Although it seems a lot longer, and I'd been rowing south in my small boat, trying to reach Moome and Valley.

416
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
Oh, really? We live there.

417
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,840
Do you? You're lucky. It must be very nice. I've never been there, but I've heard that it's beautiful.

418
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Anyway, there was a violent storm in my little boat capsized. He rescued me, and I've stayed with him in his cabin ever since.

419
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,840
And he doesn't talk about himself at all. That's very strange.

420
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,840
No, but I think he does have a big secret.

421
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
How do you know, Toft?

422
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,840
Well, sometimes he just stares and stares at the lighthouse in any sort of size.

423
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
I wonder why.

424
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,840
I did ask him once, but he glared at me in such a nasty way.

425
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
I haven't dared say a word about it since.

426
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840
You don't want to stay with him then?

427
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:10,840
Oh, yes. Well, most of the time he's really nice to me, and since I've been here, I've sort of taken care of him, because you see he doesn't really look after himself.

428
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Can I have a cup of tea, please, Mama?

429
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,840
Yes, dear. How is the light coming along?

430
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Oh, not very well. There's still a few more things I could try, though.

431
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Hello. You were on that boat fishing, weren't you?

432
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,840
Yes, I was. My name is Toft, Mum and Papa.

433
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,840
Oh, please, to meet you. Is your friend here as well? I wanted to ask him something. There's something ever quite important.

434
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
Ask him what?

435
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,840
Well, about this lighthouse for one thing.

436
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,840
Well, he won't talk about that. He just refuses to.

437
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Oh, dear, does he? The thing is, I'm trying to light this beacon, but having no success.

438
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,840
I wondered whether he might know if there's an easy way of doing it. You never know. I haven't missed something.

439
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,840
It's very quiet.

440
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
He might be out fishing, you know.

441
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Come on, let's go.

442
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,840
Where are you going, Moomin?

443
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,840
I want to ask that man some questions.

444
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
He doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who does a lot of talking.

445
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,840
Do you think he might know something about the lighthouse keeper?

446
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,840
That's what I want to find out.

447
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Hello, my name is Moomin, and this is my friend Snuffkin.

448
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,840
What's your business here?

449
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,840
I wonder, do you live here? I suppose you must have met the lighthouse keeper, have you?

450
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
I didn't want people to talk about that.

451
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,840
We were just curious about why you left the lighthouse. Do you know why?

452
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,840
No, he kept himself to himself.

453
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Oh, so you do know it. When did he leave? Where did he go? You must know.

454
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
Get.

455
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Oh, please. Had the light stopped working before he left?

456
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,840
Why did he leave the door open? Were there any shipwrecks?

457
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,840
Oh! Wait a minute. Just one more question, please.

458
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,840
Oh, don't go. There's something very important I need to know.

459
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,840
You're the only other person on the island apart from the go ship.

460
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,840
Oh, please come back. Look, my father is trying to get the lamp working again,

461
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,840
but not getting anywhere. So if you know where the keeper is, or better still,

462
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,840
how to light it when you please help, it's not only for us, but for all those ships

463
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,840
that might be in danger without it.

464
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,840
Moomin.

465
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,840
I don't think that man knows much about anything.

466
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Well, at least he's heard you and knows what you want.

467
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Let's go, Moomin.

468
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Look, over there, what's Moomin Papa doing?

469
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Snork made an a little Maya helping him.

470
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,840
Hiya!

471
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Come on.

472
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Yeah.

473
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,840
It's about time. Where are you two being?

474
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,840
What are you building now? We're making a raft. Why?

475
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,840
Because we wanted to stupid, why else would we build it? Do you like it?

476
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
But why do you want a raft?

477
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
It's not really a raft, is it Papa?

478
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Let me present our very own hand-built ghost ship.

479
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
A ghost ship?

480
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,840
He must be here somewhere.

481
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Well, if he's the one that walked on me last night, I want a word with him.

482
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Yeah, sorry. I'm afraid that was me.

483
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,840
I want a word with him.

484
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Yeah, sorry. I'm afraid that was me and my friends.

485
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
Oh, where are you?

486
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,840
Show us a bit of leg at least. I like to see you I'm talking to.

487
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Yes, all right.

488
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,840
Oh, well, at least he looks like a ghost.

489
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
Thank you.

490
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Ghosts look pretty silly when the sun's shining if you ask me.

491
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Well, it was your idea.

492
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
I always thought ghosts were frightening.

493
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,840
Yes, we forgot our chains last night.

494
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
It's very hard to be ghostly without them.

495
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
We did our best to scare you, though.

496
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,840
The ghost came to this island because a lighthouse was a bit like an ancient castle.

497
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
We feel more at home in castle.

498
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
And now when they found us here, they changed their minds and gave up.

499
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
That's funny, isn't it?

500
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
What's the matter?

501
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
You look a bit fed up.

502
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,840
That's because he's been left behind by the other ghosts.

503
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
They've gone off in the ghost ship.

504
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
Wow, they didn't tell me they were going straight away.

505
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,840
And I'd gone to the lighthouse keepers cabin.

506
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,840
The lighthouse keeper?

507
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
Why did you go there?

508
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Well, I wanted to tell him that some strange people.

509
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
I'm sorry.

510
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,840
I mean, strangers had moved into the lighthouse and that he'd be better off with us

511
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
because ghosts don't damage things.

512
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
I didn't know you then, of course.

513
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
But some people are very kind.

514
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,840
Where is his cabin?

515
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Is it easy to find?

516
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
At the southern end of the island.

517
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,840
But it was a waste of time because he wouldn't talk to me.

518
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
I shouldn't have bothered.

519
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
And then I would have caught the boat.

520
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Anyway, he's not going back to his job, so that's that.

521
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,840
Bye-bye.

522
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
Thanks again for the raft.

523
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
Take care.

524
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,840
I hope you catch up with your friends real soon.

525
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
Thank you.

526
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
You're okay for mortals.

527
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,840
I promise next time we meet Abbey Rally's scurry.

528
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
Chains and all.

529
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,840
Lots of chains and we promise to be terrified.

530
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,840
You can come and scare me anytime you want.

531
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
Bye-bye.

532
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,840
Relating a try.

533
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,840
Bye-bye.

534
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Bye-bye.

535
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,840
He said anything that could float would do.

536
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,840
But that raft seemed a bit flimsy to me.

537
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
I wouldn't like to chance it.

538
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
It can be rough out there.

539
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

540
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Those can't drown.

541
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,840
Can they?

542
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,840
They're dead already.

543
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Mama.

544
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,840
What is it, Mum and Dia?

545
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Papa's gone fishing again.

546
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Well, he enjoys it.

547
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Well, that's all he seems to do these days.

548
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,840
He's not working on the lamp at all.

549
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Well, perhaps living in a new place makes him want to do a new thing.

550
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,840
And he does catch one now and again.

551
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
What are you making, little boy?

552
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,840
An elevator.

553
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
An elevator?

554
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,840
Yes, and when that's finished, I'm going to build a house.

555
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
Oh, my goodness.

556
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,840
A house of my very own.

557
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,840
Mum and Papa doesn't seem his usual happy self,

558
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840
even though he enjoys his fishing.

559
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,840
He's upset that he couldn't make the lamp work

560
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,840
and isn't used to failure,

561
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,840
but nothing he tries makes any difference.

562
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
What a pity it would be to leave the island

563
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,840
without seeing the beautiful beams shining over the water.

564
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
MUSIC

565
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,840
Yeah, hey!

566
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
Come and have a look, everyone!

567
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
I finished my house.

568
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,840
Huh?

569
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Hey, Mum and Papa!

570
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Come here, the fisherman's coming!

571
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Wow, the fisherman!

572
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Yes, and the boy is with them!

573
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
He's off to his outside?

574
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,840
You don't want to do it, do you?

575
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,840
No, but I gotta do it.

576
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Right!

577
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Here you are.

578
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,840
So, what can we do for you?

579
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,840
Oh!

580
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you!

581
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,840
Hmm?

582
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Tough just told us it's your birthday today, so all the best wishes from us.

583
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,840
My birthday? Is it really?

584
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,840
Excuse me for asking, but how old are you?

585
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
I just don't remember.

586
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,840
It doesn't matter. I'm sorry we don't have any presents.

587
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,840
I haven't had coffee for many, many years.

588
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,840
Bring the barrel, woman mama.

589
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Yes, dear.

590
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Now, let me see. I found this...

591
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
...sawester.

592
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,840
I wonder if it suits me. What do you think?

593
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
Well...

594
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,840
I suppose this must belong to the lighthouse keeper.

595
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Why don't you try it on?

596
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,840
You look good in a sowester. There it suits you.

597
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:08,840
We'd love to know why you left the island and why you didn't come back here.

598
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,840
And also why you didn't like the land.

599
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,840
We really would like to know if you feel you could tell us.

600
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
I was so lonely.

601
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
For years and years.

602
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Then I just went away.

603
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
I'm afraid that's all.

604
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,840
But you did come back. Surely that must mean something.

605
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,840
I knew I'd lived here for too long. Much too long.

606
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,840
You see, I didn't really fit in anywhere else.

607
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:51,840
This is the lighthouse keeper's uniform, isn't it? Why don't you put it on again?

608
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,840
And look, it's nice here. I'd like to stay. Would you mind that?

609
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
I'll stay if you let me.

610
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
Ah, I'd love that.

611
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,840
It'd be fun to see you looking like a lighthouse keeper.

612
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,840
Oh, hooray!

613
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Three days later, the Moomans left the island.

614
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:37,840
They decided to leave at night with the safe blow of the lighthouse beans guiding their path out and away to Mooman Valley.

615
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Mooman Papa had quite forgotten about his epic novel of the sea, but couldn't wait to start again on his memoirs.

616
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,840
The Moomans

617
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:58,840
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomans

618
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:05,840
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomans

619
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:16,840
They're always happy and always at play. The Moomans are having fun day after day. The Moomans

620
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,840
The Moomans

621
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:27,840
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomans

622
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomans

623
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:45,840
They're always happy and always at play. The Moomans are having fun day after day. The Moomans

624
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,840
The Moomans

625
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:55,840
The Moomans

626
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:29,840
Here they are for one and all. The Moomans are about to call. Come on and sit down here with me. They're for you on your TV. They are the Moomans

627
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,840
They are the Moomans

628
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,840
So come with me, give me your hand

629
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,840
I'll take you up to a moment land

630
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,840
You can fly just like a bird

631
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Sing that song ever, there were the Moomans

632
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,840
There were the Moomans

633
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,840
There were the Moomans

634
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,840
There were the Moomans

635
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,840
There were the Moomans

636
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,840
There were the Moomans

637
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,840
Mom

638
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
Everything's so boring

639
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
Let's do something then

640
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:22,840
Like what, for instance, I think we've done everything one could possibly do

641
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,840
None of you three can think of a single thing to do. You're useless, aren't you?

642
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,840
Well, can you think of anything except catching grasshoppers?

643
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,840
There must be something we can do

644
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:40,840
Now we've all had times like this, haven't we? Fortunately, right then, the mailman arrived

645
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,840
Hello, a letter for you

646
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,840
Oh, a letter that must be from my sister for me

647
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,840
Oh no, it's from a woman Papa this time

648
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,840
That's all? Who would write to him? A woman? Someone called Jane?

649
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,840
Huh?

650
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,840
See that he gets it now

651
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Who could this Jane possibly be?

652
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,840
It's your father's old girlfriend, of course

653
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
Never

654
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,840
Oh, I'm sure he had dozens and dozens

655
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,840
Moom and Papa was very kind and handsome young man

656
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,840
A voice from the past

657
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,840
Moom and Papa, liquid, I've got for you

658
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,840
Hmm

659
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,840
Oh, no

660
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,840
I was right

661
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Yeah, you were

662
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,840
Moom and Mama, I think you should go back to the kitchen

663
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
Whatever, for a little lie

664
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,840
Because Moom and Papa store me youth is catching up with him

665
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,840
Please, Papa, tell us it's not that kind of letter

666
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,840
Oh, what would you do?

667
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,840
Don't worry

668
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,840
Whatever it was, it was a long time ago, long before I ever met you

669
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,840
No, it's not that kind of letter

670
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,840
What sort of letter is it then?

671
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,840
Oh, much worse, it's from Aunt Jane

672
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
Who's that?

673
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Mine, my dear, is on my father's side

674
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,840
Oh, how boring

675
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,840
You look very pale suddenly, dear

676
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,840
Yes, because she's coming for a visit tomorrow

677
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:10,840
Oh, don't worry, there's plenty of time for arranging a welcome party

678
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,840
But I don't like her, and I don't want her to come for a visit

679
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,840
Moom and Papa, why not?

680
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,840
Well, you'll soon see, she's very rich

681
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,840
Very rich

682
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,840
Yes, and she bosses everyone, and we won't have a moment of peace

683
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,840
Oh, maybe she's so rich, she'll give us all wonderful presents

684
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,840
Goodness, this is so unexpected, why is she coming here all of a sudden?

685
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,840
Oh, she says she wants to discuss money matters, good heavens with me

686
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,840
She says there's no one else, so you see, I'm in a very difficult situation

687
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,840
Oh, why can't you tell if you're not an expert?

688
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,840
You don't tell Aunt Jane things, she tells you when that's that

689
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,840
Is that what you explained?

690
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,840
When you meet her, you'll know exactly what I mean

691
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,840
What do I know about money matters?

692
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,840
Nothing

693
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,840
Not surprising since we've never had any

694
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,840
How can she expect a poor creature like you to know anything about money?

695
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,840
Also, she's very, very suspicious

696
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,840
And she says money is a terrible burden

697
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,840
Oh, I wouldn't mind shouldering her burden

698
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,840
Maybe you'll inherit it, and then we could share the money

699
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,840
And have a wonderful time together

700
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:40,840
This time, I almost did it

701
00:43:40,840 --> 00:44:10,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

702
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:39,840
I'm sure she jumped at it. Hmm, there'd be no harm in asking, I guess. What's the matter, Mr.

703
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:45,840
Hamilton, you look so unhappy. I'm stuck, that's my problem. How's that?

704
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:56,840
Stuck in my research, this magnifying glass is very good, of course, but I just can't get any further with my botanical research with this old fashioned equipment.

705
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:06,840
What I really need is a microscope and a laboratory. Hmm, and they're expensive, I guess. Yes, they are, and I don't have any money.

706
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:13,840
Well, moment Papa's aunt is coming over tomorrow, and I know she's got any amount of money. Any amount, Sniff?

707
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:24,840
I'll get her to finance you, Hamilton, and we'll get a big greenhouse, and you'll grow orchids and roses and other things, and then we'll sell them, oh, oh, I'll get rich. You too!

708
00:45:36,840 --> 00:46:04,840
Hey, you over there. Hmm, are you talking to me? Of course I am. Who else? I say do you know the way to move in a house young man? Yes, she might say I do. Show me where it is then.

709
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:13,840
Over there, it's tall and blue, just follow that stream and you can't miss it. Good, would you be kind enough to take my suitcase?

710
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,840
I'm sorry I can't, I'm too busy. I'll reward you handsomely for your efforts, think again young man.

711
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,840
But all I want to do is fish. What? You don't want money?

712
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:31,840
I heard you were coming to visit moment Papa, you're a Jane, aren't you?

713
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:37,840
Oh, well, please to meet you, I'm here to take you to moment house. Is this your suitcase?

714
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,840
Wow, this suitcase is very heavy.

715
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,840
Should be, it's full of golden coins.

716
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:53,840
Oh, I'll take care of this. Let's go and take.

717
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:09,840
I can't stay in this house, I don't think I can take Aunt Jane. I'm going to hide out in the cave until she's gone.

718
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:22,840
Bye bye, then dear. Careful now Aunt Jane. The banks have been slippery here and there.

719
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,840
A roundhouse, how stupid, typical of my nephew.

720
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,840
Welcome to moment house Aunt Jane.

721
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,840
Welcome Aunt Jane.

722
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,840
I'd like you to meet us up in a minute.

723
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,840
Please to meet you.

724
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,840
She's very small for a daughter.

725
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,840
Oh little Mai isn't ours, she just lives here.

726
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,840
And I won't get any bigger, either.

727
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,840
Hmm, she's like a member of the family.

728
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,840
And where's my worthless nephew? Why isn't he here?

729
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,840
Oh, well, he's not, is he not at home?

730
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,840
Well, no, when will he be back? I don't know.

731
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,840
He's away looking for inspiration for his work, so he won't be back for a while.

732
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,840
Since when has he worked? I'm here to see him.

733
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,840
Maybe you can see me instead.

734
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,840
What a splendid idea, how clever of you, moment.

735
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,840
Ridiculous, he knows nothing about money.

736
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:30,840
In that case, it is high time he learned. As for his father, I may still disinherit him.

737
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,840
I'm a member of his family, too. I could talk to you about money matters.

738
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,840
Really?

739
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,840
Oh, sniff is a great friend of mine.

740
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,840
Hmm.

741
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,840
But hardly a member of the family.

742
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,840
Hello, moment. And you must be on Jane.

743
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:54,840
I brought my brother to snort with me. He wanted to meet you.

744
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,840
This is Aunt Jane, the nice dog.

745
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,840
Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane.

746
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,840
This is my lovely sister, snort maiden, who is Moomin's special friend.

747
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,840
The snorts and the Moomin's may one day be related.

748
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,840
So in a way, we're all really family.

749
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,840
You maybe, but not to me.

750
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,840
I'm an inventor, and due to an accident, I'm looking around for a sponsor.

751
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,840
A golden opportunity for anyone with some loose capital.

752
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,840
Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane.

753
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,840
I'm Hemmielin, a botanist of note.

754
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,840
I heard that you might be willing to fund my scientific research, Aunt Jane.

755
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,840
A golden opportunity for anyone with some spare money, eh?

756
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,840
You'd like me to fund your research?

757
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,840
It was my idea.

758
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:46,840
If we built a greenhouse and grow rare orchids and roses, we can make a lot of money.

759
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,840
And you'll make a lot of money.

760
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,840
Young man, I have a lot of money already.

761
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,840
Oh, hasn't sniff discussed this with you, Mom?

762
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,840
Yes, sniff.

763
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,840
Well, I was just getting around to it, Hemmielin.

764
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,840
Confusing?

765
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,840
When I am famous for my botanical research, Aunt Jane, I...

766
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,840
I don't know that will ever happen.

767
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,840
This is very confusing indeed for me.

768
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,840
Now, you're snorkemaid and a friend of Moomin, is that right?

769
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,840
Oh, no, I'm the snorric snort maiden's brother.

770
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,840
I'm a friend of Moomin, Aunt Jane.

771
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,840
Did you really explain about my important research, Sniff?

772
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,840
Did you really explain that I'm a member of the family?

773
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,840
Hey, she got it!

774
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,840
So, Aunt Jane would be grateful to all of you and make you a member of the family.

775
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,840
Thank you, Aunt Jane.

776
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,840
Here's your rule, Aunt Jane.

777
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,840
Oh, I do hope you'll be comfortable here.

778
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,840
Just call if you need anything.

779
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,840
Oh...

780
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,840
Come out.

781
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,840
Here's your suitcase.

782
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,840
It was very heavy.

783
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,840
Thank you.

784
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,840
Hemm...

785
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,840
What is it?

786
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,840
You want a reward?

787
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,840
No, no, Aunt Jane.

788
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,840
I mean, yes, I do, but...

789
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,840
Uh...

790
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,840
Which is it?

791
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,840
Will you make up your mind, young man?

792
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,840
I know where Moomin Papa is right now.

793
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,840
He's a whale and a trip, I know.

794
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,840
No, no. He's somewhere quite near.

795
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,840
Quite near here?

796
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,840
Well, where is he?

797
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,840
Moomin Papa said not to tell you where he's hiding.

798
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,840
It's a secret.

799
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
A secret?

800
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,840
Yes.

801
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,840
I suppose I could tell you, but he'll be very angry.

802
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,840
Where is he? Tell me now.

803
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,840
Well, if I tell you I'm taking a big risk...

804
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,840
Hmm.

805
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,840
Oh, very well.

806
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,840
How much do you want?

807
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,840
I'll leave that to you.

808
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,840
Thank you for the information.

809
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,840
Now you shall have your reward.

810
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,840
Hold out your hand.

811
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,840
Oh, is that all?

812
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,840
Until I've seen him for myself with my own eyes.

813
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,840
Yes!

814
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,840
Huh?

815
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,840
What?

816
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,840
Oh, there's nobody here.

817
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,840
Where is my worthless nephew?

818
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,840
Hey, this is very strange.

819
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,840
You tricked me, haven't you?

820
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,840
Well, no, I swear I would never do that.

821
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,840
You certainly deserve no reward.

822
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,840
Huh?

823
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,840
But no, wait.

824
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,840
If we just look around, we'll find him.

825
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,840
He's in here somewhere I know it.

826
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,840
Hey, Moomin Papa, I got rid of her.

827
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,840
Moomin, Mama.

828
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,840
Yes, Aunt Jane, what is it?

829
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,840
Tell me where my nephew is hiding.

830
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,840
Well, as I said before...

831
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,840
I want to know the truth.

832
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,840
Dear, he's...

833
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,840
Now let me see...

834
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,840
Come on, hurry up.

835
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,840
He's hiding in the cave down by the beach.

836
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,840
I've just been there, Moomin Mama, and I can't find him.

837
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,840
Then he really must have gone away on a trip.

838
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,840
And why should he want to hide from me anyway?

839
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,840
I think he might be a little bit afraid of you.

840
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,840
Afraid of me?

841
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,840
Afraid of his own aunt?

842
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,840
But why?

843
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,840
Mostly he's afraid of money matters.

844
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,840
Incredible.

845
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,840
Afraid of me because of money matters?

846
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,840
He must be utterly mad.

847
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,840
What a family.

848
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,840
I don't understand.

849
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:02,840
It seems that only Smith knows anything about money.

850
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,840
I know where Moomin Papa is right now.

851
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,840
So you want some of my gold, who do you young lady?

852
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,840
I couldn't care less about your silly gold.

853
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,840
My silly gold indeed.

854
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:17,840
With silly gold, I assure you you can do just anything you want.

855
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:22,840
Seems to me your silly gold doesn't even help you to find Moomin Papa.

856
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,840
Hmm?

857
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,840
I think you should forget about your money.

858
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,840
Young lady, money isn't something you can just forget about.

859
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,840
It needs constant looking after.

860
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,840
That's why I must talk to Moomin Papa at once.

861
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,840
Now take me to that rascal nephew of mine.

862
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,840
If you really know where he is, do you hear me?

863
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,840
Do you have me?

864
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,840
Of course.

865
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,840
Oh wow, frivolous.

866
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,840
Not really.

867
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:52,840
If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too.

868
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,840
Oh well, Frederick and I were frivolous once.

869
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Really?

870
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,840
Of course.

871
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,840
Oh wow, frivolous.

872
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,840
Not really.

873
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,840
If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too.

874
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,840
I'd be frivolous once.

875
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,840
Really?

876
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:08,840
If you say so, I suppose I have to believe you.

877
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,840
Huh?

878
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
Look.

879
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
What?

880
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,840
Little May and Anne Jane walking together.

881
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,840
What are they doing?

882
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,840
Little May is plotting something.

883
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,840
Really?

884
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,840
Moomin?

885
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:33,840
Sniffs are right, really.

886
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,840
But sometimes he just can't withstand the lure of gold.

887
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,840
Check me.

888
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,840
No.

889
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,840
Well you can't be right.

890
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,840
Let's go back then.

891
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,840
Fine, just take your time.

892
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,840
Hi guys.

893
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,840
Little May, what's the matter?

894
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,840
We have a guest.

895
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,840
A guest?

896
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,840
Moomin Papa.

897
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,840
What?

898
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,840
Moomin Papa.

899
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,840
Woah.

900
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,840
So.

901
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,840
This is where you've been hiding.

902
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,840
What else?

903
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,840
Wait.

904
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,840
I have to shoot you.

905
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,840
And I have to go back.

906
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,840
Wait and Jane.

907
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,840
No, you wait first.

908
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,480
Oh, no!

909
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,220
Ah!

910
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,100
Wait, please.

911
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,320
Momen Papa was sort of on his way back from a trip

912
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,480
and then stopped by to play chess with me.

913
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,320
Yes, exactly.

914
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,160
No, yes!

915
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,220
Momen Mama told her the truth!

916
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,460
Oh, I sort of stopped by.

917
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,060
Why are you so afraid of me, young man?

918
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,700
Well, I'm not not really.

919
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,040
I mean, it's not you.

920
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:46,720
It's your money.

921
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,680
I'm afraid of it, really scared.

922
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,680
Scared of my money?

923
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,980
Well, I'm not.

924
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,340
It's perfectly good money at all in gold coins.

925
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:59,840
Listen nephew, I'm depending on you as my only relative.

926
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,840
Yes, yes, please depend.

927
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:05,340
When I get too old to do it, you must look after my gold for me.

928
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,840
I'm relying on you.

929
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,840
No, that's not possible.

930
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,840
I know and Jane, we can give it all away.

931
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,840
Must be those who'd love to have it.

932
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,840
Must be those who need it more than we do.

933
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,840
Oh, a green pearl!

934
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,840
She's crazy.

935
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,840
Don't worry, we'll think of something.

936
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,840
Oh, you would throw my money away without a cut.

937
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,840
Why didn't you mean to hurt you and Jane?

938
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,840
I know, let's put it all in the bank.

939
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,840
Money likes being in the bank.

940
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,840
My money would hate being in a bag.

941
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,840
It's a terrible idea.

942
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,840
Oh, no, banks are so nice nowadays.

943
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,840
They all...

944
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:54,840
Of course, they have flowers and shiny piggy banks and pretty paintings on the wall.

945
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,840
Is that really true?

946
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,840
Right, come on everybody.

947
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,840
Let's hurry home and fix a welcoming party for Jane.

948
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,840
Oh, you're right.

949
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,840
You're right.

950
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,840
You're right.

951
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,840
Come on everybody.

952
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,840
Let's hurry home and fix a welcoming party for Jane.

953
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,840
A party!

954
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,840
Yes, any reason is good enough.

955
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,840
This was Grandma's best cake recipe.

956
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,840
Welcome at Jane.

957
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:37,840
Let's drink a toast to the only millionaire in our small circle.

958
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,840
May she live a long and healthy life.

959
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,840
Cheers!

960
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,840
Cheers!

961
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,840
Now, this is your welcoming party at Jane.

962
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,840
What's the matter?

963
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,840
Never in my life of I and my money felt ourselves as welcomed before.

964
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,840
I'm so happy I could cry.

965
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,840
Oh, and once you start crying, you just want to go aww.

966
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,840
Not again.

967
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,840
Please don't be unhappy at Jane, don't cry.

968
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,840
Oh, dear!

969
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,840
Mum and Papa!

970
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,840
Mum and Papa!

971
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,840
Yes, and Jane, what is it?

972
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:22,840
I'll put some of my gold in a bank, but you must look after the rest when I'm too old.

973
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,840
And why not?

974
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,840
All right.

975
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:30,840
We'll keep it in the cellar and make a nice little niche for it with seashells and moss.

976
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,840
And I'll have someone go down and look at it every week.

977
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,840
Don't you worry, and Jane, your money will be in safe hands.

978
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,840
Not quite, but I had in mind.

979
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,840
I know.

980
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,840
But I suppose it can't be helped.

981
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:46,840
It sounds rather nice, a cozy little niche down in the cellar.

982
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:52,840
And if you take a look every week, but oh, dear, it will miss me.

983
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,840
Oh, and Jane.

984
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,840
Very well.

985
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,840
I have made up my mind.

986
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:02,840
I'm leaving this suitcase with you now, so you and my gold can get certain used to each other.

987
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,840
Do what you want with it.

988
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,840
Your friends seem to have ideas about how to spend it.

989
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,840
Flying ships and botanical research sound rather splendid.

990
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,840
Ooh!

991
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,840
Wonderful!

992
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,840
I'm so happy for you.

993
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:20,840
Darn, I should have let us up better than flowers.

994
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:28,840
So end of the visit of the credit and Jane.

995
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:34,840
And I'm sure Sniff will be able to think of some other use for the gold.

996
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:10,840
The moment, the moment, the moment, the moment.

997
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:36,840
Here they are for one and all.

998
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,840
The moments are about to come.

999
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,840
Come on and sit down here with me.

1000
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,840
They're here for you on your TV.

1001
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,840
They are the moments.

1002
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,840
They are the moments.

1003
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,840
So come with me.

1004
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,840
Give me your hand.

1005
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,840
I'll take you up to a moment land.

1006
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,840
You can fly just like a bird.

1007
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,840
Sing that song ever.

1008
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,840
There were the moments.

1009
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,840
There were the moments.

1010
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:12,840
There were the moments.

1011
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:16,840
There were the moments.

1012
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,840
There were the moments.

1013
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:40,840
One day in Newman Valley, not long before midsummer on a perfectly ordinary day,

1014
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,840
Sniffkin suddenly announced that he was going on a short trip.

1015
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,840
Where are you going, Sniffkin?

1016
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,840
Well, not very far.

1017
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,840
I'll be back right after midsummer.

1018
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:56,840
But Sniffkin, you'll miss the bonfire at the big party.

1019
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,840
But why in the world are you going away?

1020
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,840
There's something I've been dying to do for a long time,

1021
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:04,840
and it has to be done on midsummer eve.

1022
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:10,840
I promise to tell you all about it, as soon as I'm back in Newman Valley.

1023
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,840
Little did Sniffkin know that before he came back,

1024
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,840
the underwater volcano which had kept quiet ever since

1025
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,840
Moon and Papa's youth would wake up again.

1026
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,840
What's all that smoke?

1027
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,840
Is it the volcano and your father's memoirs?

1028
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:44,840
I don't think I like this.

1029
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,840
I don't think I like this.

1030
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,840
I think it's exciting.

1031
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,840
Well, in that case, you can have it.

1032
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,840
Moon and Mama.

1033
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,840
Yes, what is it, dear?

1034
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,840
This hammock is shaking.

1035
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,840
It's very unpleasant.

1036
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,840
I think it's that volcano you told us about.

1037
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,840
Yes, I guess it must be.

1038
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,840
Mama!

1039
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,840
Papa!

1040
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,840
There's a smoke rising from the city, Papa!

1041
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,840
No!

1042
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,840
Oh, that's very odd.

1043
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,840
What is it, Papa?

1044
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,840
Let me see!

1045
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,840
What's going on?

1046
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,840
I don't know, really.

1047
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,840
I guess there isn't much we can do.

1048
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,840
Hey!

1049
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,840
I can't see.

1050
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,840
Where is it?

1051
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,840
Let me see.

1052
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,840
No, I'm at first.

1053
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,840
Yes, no, I've got it.

1054
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,840
Please, let me see!

1055
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,840
No, I'm at first!

1056
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:52,840
Moon and Papa, will these earthquakes begin your youth?

1057
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,840
No, they certainly weren't.

1058
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,840
And this one's underwater.

1059
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,840
Oh, might net cause a tide of waves?

1060
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,840
A tide of waves.

1061
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,840
Goodness, I never thought of that.

1062
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,840
Hey, what are you doing?

1063
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,840
Snatch at me, lad.

1064
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,840
What do you think?

1065
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,840
Can you see anything unusual, Moon and Papa?

1066
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,840
I've never seen anything like it.

1067
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,840
This is very unusual.

1068
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,840
Oh, my!

1069
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,840
I want to see it too!

1070
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,840
Come on!

1071
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,840
How can you bite during a catastrophe?

1072
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,840
Whatever you do, don't!

1073
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,840
Right the top!

1074
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,840
Oh!

1075
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,840
Oh!

1076
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,840
Oh!

1077
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,840
Oh!

1078
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,840
You're so stupid.

1079
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,840
You should have let me have it first.

1080
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,840
It's all your fault, little my.

1081
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,840
Anyone can see that.

1082
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,840
How dare you say it was all my fault?

1083
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,840
It was just fault the whole way.

1084
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,840
Snort maiden?

1085
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,840
Yes.

1086
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,840
So why don't you stay over in Moomin House?

1087
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,840
You'd be careful.

1088
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,840
You look after her, won't you, Moomin Papa?

1089
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,840
Certainly, Snort.

1090
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,840
I don't like the look of things.

1091
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,840
No, do I.

1092
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,840
No, do I.

1093
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,840
We better get inside, Moomin House quickly.

1094
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,840
Everybody has to stay together.

1095
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,840
It's scary.

1096
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:18,840
You're in the earthquake, Snort maiden.

1097
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,840
Snort maiden?

1098
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,840
Snort maiden?

1099
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,840
Snort maiden?

1100
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,840
Snort maiden?

1101
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,840
Snort maiden?

1102
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,840
Snort maiden?

1103
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,840
Snort maiden?

1104
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,840
Snort maiden?

1105
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,840
Snort maiden?

1106
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,840
Snort maiden?

1107
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,840
Snort maiden?

1108
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,840
Snort maiden?

1109
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,840
Snort maiden?

1110
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,840
Snort maiden?

1111
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,840
Snort maiden?

1112
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,840
Snort maiden?

1113
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,840
Snort maiden?

1114
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,840
Snort maiden?

1115
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,840
Snort maiden?

1116
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,840
Snort maiden?

1117
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,840
Snort maiden?

1118
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,840
Snort maiden?

1119
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,840
Snort maiden?

1120
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,840
Snort maiden?

1121
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,840
Snort maiden?

1122
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,840
Snort maiden?

1123
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,840
Snort maiden?

1124
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,840
Oh, yeah!

1125
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:34,840
What's that noise?

1126
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,840
Listen, can you hear?

1127
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,840
A noise?

1128
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,840
What noise?

1129
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,840
I don't know.

1130
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,840
Sounds like water to me.

1131
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:51,840
Oh no! What's happened? Movement House has drifted off to sea.

1132
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,840
I don't believe this.

1133
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,840
I think Movement Valley is flooded. It really is.

1134
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,840
What's happened to the kitchen and dining room?

1135
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,840
Just because I feared.

1136
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,840
What are we going to do?

1137
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:14,840
Movement Mama can't even prepare breakfast down there.

1138
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,840
Oh, good morning. You're up early today.

1139
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,840
Mama, Movement House is flooded. All of Movement Valley is under water.

1140
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,840
Oh dear, I think you're right, Movement. It's Papa's still asleep.

1141
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:29,840
Let's go and wake him up. He definitely wouldn't want to miss it.

1142
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,840
Boy, I'm sleepy.

1143
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,840
I'm even sleepy.

1144
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,840
I didn't sleep a wink because he was snoring.

1145
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,840
Little Mai was snoring so hard. The whole bed was shaking.

1146
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,840
I'm going to have a nap as soon as I've had something to eat.

1147
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,840
Hey, Sniff!

1148
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,840
What's this? Where am I? What's happened here?

1149
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,840
Movement House has flooded, Sniff.

1150
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:53,840
Oh, Papa! This means I'll have to swim to get home.

1151
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,840
You'll have to dive to get into your house.

1152
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,840
Hmm, unless I'm mistaken, the water is still rising.

1153
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,840
Movement Papa, you've got to do something. Do something right away.

1154
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,840
I think you better start taking swimming lessons.

1155
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,840
And don't worry, Sniff. I'll start organizing.

1156
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,840
What do you want to organize, Movement Mama?

1157
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,840
Well, dear, I guess we should have some breakfast first of all.

1158
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,840
Yes!

1159
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,840
But how do we get into the kitchen, Papa?

1160
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,840
You just leave that to me.

1161
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,840
There, your kitchen.

1162
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,840
I've never seen it from above before.

1163
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,840
Oh, my goodness.

1164
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:36,840
People should look at their rooms from above once in a while.

1165
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:40,840
Look, cars of food floating from the cellar.

1166
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,840
What luck we have a trap door!

1167
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,840
Mama, shall I dive in and get them?

1168
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,840
Yes, please, Movement. Be careful, Movement.

1169
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,840
It's got to be done.

1170
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:54,840
Hurry up, Movement. I'm hungry.

1171
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,840
Could you get us some bowls and plates this time?

1172
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:06,840
Sure.

1173
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,840
And indeed, the water was still rising.

1174
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,840
It's coming. It's coming. Help!

1175
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,840
The water's up to the third floor.

1176
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,840
What are we going to do, Movement Papa? Where's Movement Papa?

1177
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,840
He's up on the roof, Sniff, with the others.

1178
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,840
What are they doing up on the roof?

1179
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,840
Ah, there goes another poorly built house.

1180
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,840
Why doesn't our house float away, Papa?

1181
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,840
It's all very simple, dear son. I built it myself.

1182
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,840
If you hadn't, maybe we wouldn't be about to sink altogether.

1183
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,840
Here we are.

1184
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,840
Are you coming to help me, everybody?

1185
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:01,840
This is one of Grandma's best plates, so please be extra careful.

1186
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,840
I know. But where do you think we're going, Mama?

1187
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,840
Something will float by. Big enough to take all of us. We just have to wait.

1188
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,840
I'm not gonna wait for that. I think this family's out in touch with reality.

1189
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,840
Something big enough will float by indeed, huh?

1190
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,840
I'm gonna sink my old skin while I'm still tired.

1191
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,840
This is something I should have done immediately, but it's not too late.

1192
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,840
Look, there's a whole house drifting by.

1193
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,840
Oh, you're right. It's very odd looking house, though.

1194
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,840
Yes, it does look funny, but I think we'd better take it.

1195
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,840
Hmm. That's the one we're getting.

1196
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,840
Help me!

1197
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,840
Stop! I'm coming with you!

1198
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,840
Don't leave me behind.

1199
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,840
Where's that house?

1200
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,840
Right over there. Just there. Can't you see it, Sniff?

1201
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,840
Oh, that house. What? You call that a house?

1202
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,840
Hurry up, Sniff! What are you doing?

1203
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,840
I just changed my mind. That one looks like it's going to sink.

1204
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,840
No, it's fine. We're all aboard. Come on.

1205
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,840
I don't believe you. Soon as I'm aboard, it'll sink. I can feel it.

1206
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,840
He's scared of his own shadow. Let's leave him. Move any such a whimp.

1207
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,840
Come on. It's all right.

1208
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,840
Now, don't worry about me. You can let go of the ladder. I'm fine.

1209
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,840
Stay behind if you like, Sniff. Look what about your breakfast?

1210
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:51,840
We have all the food here, and you might get hungry, and if you do, there'll be nothing to eat.

1211
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,840
Why didn't you say so before?

1212
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:59,840
And now, hold the ladder steady. I don't want to be abandoned.

1213
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:04,840
No, brother. He's gonna make it. You know, what is it he actually ever followed?

1214
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,840
Hey, I'm falling on it. I'm falling on it.

1215
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,840
No, don't do the same. Don't shake it.

1216
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,840
No, don't shake it. Hold the steady.

1217
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,840
Excuse us. Hello, anybody home.

1218
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,840
Don't worry. We're not dangerous.

1219
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,840
Isn't breakfast ready yet? I'm starving to death.

1220
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,840
There's no one here, Papa.

1221
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,840
I think you're right. It certainly seems empty.

1222
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,840
Oh, and the most exciting empty house I've ever seen.

1223
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:48,840
Why do you say that? What do you mean exciting? Do you mean interesting or do you mean scary little my?

1224
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,840
Interesting and scary. Look, Snorgmaiden. Look around.

1225
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,840
Oh, what a lot of mirrors.

1226
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,840
This house must have been full of women who loved clothes.

1227
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:03,840
Or maybe just one woman, Snorgmaiden, who had as many faces as there are mirrors in this room.

1228
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:08,840
I don't like that. Look, every mirror has a chair in front of it.

1229
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:13,840
It's like so. This house was full of ladies and each had her own little mirror.

1230
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:23,840
Thank goodness we brought some plates with us.

1231
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:29,840
Woman, mama, woman, mama. Look what I found. Bread and apples.

1232
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,840
How nice, sniff. Now we can have a real breakfast.

1233
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,840
But where is everybody?

1234
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:39,840
Well, I don't know. Somewhere around.

1235
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,840
Whoever lived here must have had a lot of strange hobbies.

1236
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,840
You're so right.

1237
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,840
Who said that?

1238
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,840
Wow, look at that cog wheel. This snork would love that.

1239
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,840
I wonder what woman will say about this little mind?

1240
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,840
I'm sure he'll say you look better without anything.

1241
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,840
But one look at you and he won't even notice anything else.

1242
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,840
Well, if he has any sense, he will fall for me like a ton of bricks.

1243
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,840
You want about breakfast, woman, mama?

1244
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:18,840
We'll have breakfast as soon as we are all here. I wonder where they can all be.

1245
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,840
You know, it's very bad for me to go hungry. I always feel unwell if I don't eat.

1246
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,840
All right, sniff. You go ahead. But mind you don't eat all the apples.

1247
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,840
Leave some for the others, won't you?

1248
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:34,840
Oh, don't worry. Of course I will, mom and mama.

1249
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,840
This is an apple.

1250
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,840
Oh, but where on earth did you find them, Sniff?

1251
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,840
In a frugal.

1252
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,840
But normal trick to play on people making false fruit.

1253
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,840
I very upset.

1254
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,840
Oh, this is not bread.

1255
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,840
Who?

1256
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:05,840
Who could have done such a cruel thing to me?

1257
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,840
Somebody with a very odd sense of humor, I'd say.

1258
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,840
Somebody without anything.

1259
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:14,840
Have some cheese instead, that at least comes from Moomin Valley.

1260
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:17,840
And it looks delicious.

1261
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,840
Whatever these levers for.

1262
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,840
Uh-huh.

1263
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,840
What's that hear you sound? It's creepy.

1264
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,840
Can't you hear it? It sounds like a new earthquake.

1265
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,840
Yes, I can hear it.

1266
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,840
It's scary and spooky and creepy. All you need is try to be out of my mind.

1267
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:42,840
Oh, I wonder what it can be. It's very strange indeed.

1268
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,840
I just don't think I can take another earthquake right now, Moomin.

1269
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,840
Yeah?

1270
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,840
Oh, my goodness. Oh, look. What is it, Sniff?

1271
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:53,840
Look, Moomin, Moomin, look!

1272
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,840
Why? Our table is gone.

1273
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,840
This is a haunted mansion, Moomin, Moomin.

1274
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:02,840
Well, they can't take grandma's plates just like that.

1275
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,840
You could have them laid back, but I'll keep the cheese.

1276
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,840
I like cheese.

1277
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,840
This is good cheese. You bet, Moomin, Moomin.

1278
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,840
Yes, I certainly did.

1279
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,840
Better not let our food out of sight.

1280
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,840
Let's get out of this house, please, Moomin, Moomin.

1281
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,840
What's this?

1282
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,840
What's happening?

1283
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,840
Moomin, you'll have to get out of here. What?

1284
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:27,840
What?

1285
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:28,840
What?

1286
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:29,840
What?

1287
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,840
What?

1288
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:31,840
What?

1289
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:32,840
What?

1290
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,840
What?

1291
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:39,840
What?

1292
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,840
What?

1293
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,840
What?

1294
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:42,840
What?

1295
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:43,840
What?

1296
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:44,840
What?

1297
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:45,840
What?

1298
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:46,840
What?

1299
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,840
What?

1300
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:49,840
What?

1301
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,840
What?

1302
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:51,840
What?

1303
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,840
What?

1304
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:53,840
What?

1305
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,840
Papa, was it the witch who was laughing?

1306
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,840
No.

1307
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,840
The doctor's coming from that ugly one.

1308
01:17:58,840 --> 01:17:59,840
What?

1309
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,840
What?

1310
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,840
Be behind there.

1311
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,840
Did I hear someone call me an ugly thing just now?

1312
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,840
Oh, excuse us, Madam.

1313
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,840
You must be the owner of this house.

1314
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:17,840
No.

1315
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,840
Indeed, I am not.

1316
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:21,840
Most certainly not.

1317
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:22,840
You are greatly mistaken.

1318
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,840
This is no house you fold.

1319
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:25,840
This is a theater.

1320
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:26,840
A theater?

1321
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:27,840
Yes.

1322
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,840
This is a stage where the heroin receives a standing ovation

1323
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,840
at the end of the last act.

1324
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,840
And the bread and the apples are props.

1325
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,840
And the rumour you are playing is where the actors make themselves

1326
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,840
up to become totally different people.

1327
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,840
Kings are murderers.

1328
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,840
Oh, and you are one of these actors?

1329
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:45,840
And actress.

1330
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,840
You understand less than nothing.

1331
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,840
See this brum here?

1332
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,840
This is my only prop.

1333
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,840
I sweep the dust in this theater.

1334
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:54,840
Oh, really?

1335
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,840
I have wielded this brum for nearly 20 years.

1336
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,840
Would nobody help me?

1337
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,840
20 years I have cleaned this theater beautifully.

1338
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,840
My name is Emma.

1339
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,840
Emma.

1340
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:07,840
And you.

1341
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,840
You better remember that this is a theater.

1342
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:11,840
This is no ordinary house.

1343
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,840
And it is a great honor for you to be here at all.

1344
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,840
That's true.

1345
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,840
Does this mean that we can stay here just for a while?

1346
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,840
Yes, until the actors return.

1347
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,840
Today they all came to a low-verset.

1348
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,840
Wow.

1349
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,840
Really cool.

1350
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,840
Yes, it certainly is.

1351
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,840
We'll try not to bother you, Emma.

1352
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:53,840
What have you done?

1353
01:19:53,840 --> 01:20:00,840
Oh, well, what have you done?

1354
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:05,840
We seem to have hit a tree, so the house has stopped.

1355
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,840
This is a theater not a house.

1356
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,840
Oh, it's a rowing tree.

1357
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:15,840
How lovely it looks, how nice you have crashed into such a beautiful tree.

1358
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:16,840
It's gorgeous.

1359
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,840
And that smell.

1360
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:19,840
You know what?

1361
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,840
I'd like to spend the night in that great idea, movement.

1362
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,840
I'm coming with you, how exciting.

1363
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,840
You better stay here.

1364
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,840
You're bound to fall into the water.

1365
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:30,840
Look who's talking.

1366
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:31,840
Scary cat.

1367
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,840
That looks safe.

1368
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,840
We could easily spend the night here.

1369
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,840
We better tie the theater to the tree, so it won't drift away.

1370
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,840
If that's all right with Emma.

1371
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,840
Emma, is it all right to tie the theater to the tree?

1372
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:45,840
Do what you want.

1373
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,840
As long as you don't damage the theater to get here.

1374
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,840
All right.

1375
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:53,840
Don't whistle you idiot.

1376
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,840
Don't ever whistle in a theater.

1377
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,840
That's the worst luck possible.

1378
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,840
Oh, how dare you.

1379
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:00,840
Oh.

1380
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,840
This is great snorkemaiden.

1381
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,840
We can look at the moon.

1382
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,840
And the flowers.

1383
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,840
They smell so good.

1384
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,840
What's the matter?

1385
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,840
I hope that snorke's all right.

1386
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,840
Don't you worry.

1387
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,840
He was standing guard over a flying ship after all.

1388
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,840
All you have to do is get on board and fly away.

1389
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:00,840
What's going on here?

1390
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:01,840
Huh?

1391
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:08,840
No, they're trying to destroy the pamphor's box.

1392
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,840
I've never seen anything like it.

1393
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:13,840
These people are bunch of vandals.

1394
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,840
Oh.

1395
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:30,840
Meanwhile, movement and snorkemaiden are fast asleep,

1396
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:33,840
blissfully unaware of what was happening.

1397
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,840
But whatever will they do, stranded on the treetop?

1398
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:41,840
They love those afterruns.

1399
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,840
They're not the only ones who can get on board.

1400
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,840
They're the only ones who can get on board.

1401
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,840
They're the only ones who can get on board.

1402
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,840
They're the only ones who can get on board.

1403
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,840
They're the only ones who can get on board.

1404
01:22:53,840 --> 01:23:00,840
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

1405
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:07,840
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1406
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,840
They're always happy and goes at play.

1407
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,840
The movements are having fun day after day.

1408
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:28,840
The movements, the movements, the movements.

1409
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:54,840
Here they are for one and all.

1410
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,840
The movements are about to come.

1411
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,840
Come on and sit down here with me.

1412
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,840
They're here for you on your TV.

1413
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,840
They are the movements.

1414
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,840
They are the movements.

1415
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:11,840
So come with me, give me your hand.

1416
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,840
I'll take you up to a movement land.

1417
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,840
You can fly just like a bird.

1418
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,840
Sing that song ever.

1419
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,840
There were the movements.

1420
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,840
There were the movements.

1421
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:34,840
There were the movements.

1422
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:38,840
There were the movements.

1423
01:24:44,840 --> 01:25:06,280
The sun was high in the sky, and the floating theater had floated away a long time ago.

1424
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:14,120
Oh, I feel so good.

1425
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:19,320
I really slept like a log all night.

1426
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:27,400
It's so lovely to be out in the fresh air with Moomin and a tree in blue.

1427
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:34,120
No! No! The house is gone! I mean, the theater is gone!

1428
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:39,720
Moomin! What? Wake up, Moomin! Wake up! There's been a catastrophe! Wake up!

1429
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:43,000
What's a catastrophe? Look down!

1430
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,680
The theater's floated off during the night.

1431
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:50,120
I don't believe it.

1432
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:03,080
It has! It's gone! I can't see it anywhere.

1433
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:10,280
It must be far away by now. Moomin, your father's walking stick! Huh?

1434
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:14,920
It must have got loose in the middle of the night while everybody was asleep.

1435
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,120
Crying won't solve the problems, don't made it?

1436
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:25,960
But we're stranded in a row and tree with water all around us.

1437
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:41,880
Huh?

1438
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:52,760
Huh? Oh, no! We're in a drift! We're floating away!

1439
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:54,120
We're drifting away!

1440
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,760
Oh, what are we going to do?

1441
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:04,440
Moomin and Snorkmaiden are still up in that beautiful row and tree.

1442
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,960
That's just typical.

1443
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,920
Where is it? And the Hagenuim drifted so far away.

1444
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,320
He whistled last night, didn't you?

1445
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:14,920
I told you never to do that in a theater that brings bad luck.

1446
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:24,920
Help! Help!

1447
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:28,920
Don't get back here, too happy. Let's go upstairs!

1448
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,920
Stop right here!

1449
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,920
Oh, little mind!

1450
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:36,920
Oh, no!

1451
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,920
Oh, that was me!

1452
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,120
Oh, dear!

1453
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:42,120
Oh, little mind!

1454
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:45,720
Oh, get this hurry! You're so mean and so mean!

1455
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,920
Little mind is drifting off.

1456
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:51,720
Scenes were stranded and that's not a bad thing.

1457
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,720
The aiders shouldn't swim about like that.

1458
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:04,120
I'm too scared to get over to your side.

1459
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:06,120
You must be brave, Snorkmaiden.

1460
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,120
I'll catch you so you want to fall, okay?

1461
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,120
I told you so, the branch didn't break, did it?

1462
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,120
Thank you for saving me!

1463
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,120
Are you all right, Moomin?

1464
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:34,120
I can stand up, Snorkmaiden. Look, the water's only ankle deep.

1465
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,120
Really?

1466
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,120
Oh!

1467
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,120
Are you all right, Snorkmaiden?

1468
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:46,120
Yes, it's so shallow.

1469
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:52,120
I wonder where I'm going to end up.

1470
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:56,120
It doesn't matter, I rather like this boat.

1471
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,120
It's a nice, I'll go back to sleep for a while.

1472
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:08,120
It's getting dark, isn't it?

1473
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,120
Oh?

1474
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:16,120
Yes, dry land! Look there!

1475
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:18,120
A fire!

1476
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:20,120
Must be people over there.

1477
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,120
Yes!

1478
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:38,120
Of course I forgotten tonight's mid-summer eve!

1479
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:06,120
What a strange catch!

1480
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,120
So the Moomin's split up.

1481
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:16,120
Are they in trouble, little Mai?

1482
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:18,120
Yeah, seems I was probably the luckiest one as usual.

1483
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:20,120
More!

1484
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:24,120
I'm sorry you can't have any more, that's all I have.

1485
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,120
I don't believe you, your bag's still full.

1486
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,120
Yes, but not with food, little Mai.

1487
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:30,120
What's in it then?

1488
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,120
You'll soon find out.

1489
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,120
Where are we going?

1490
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:38,120
To a park.

1491
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:40,120
I hope there's a hot dog stand there.

1492
01:30:56,120 --> 01:31:00,120
Those two over there are the park keeper and his wife.

1493
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,120
Look, they're always watching.

1494
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:06,120
They guard a lot of poor orphans who come to the park every day.

1495
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,120
Really?

1496
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,120
Look over there!

1497
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:16,120
Unbelievable!

1498
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:30,120
Hey, what's this?

1499
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:32,120
Hey kids!

1500
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:36,120
Come on everybody, we're here to let you out.

1501
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:38,120
Come quickly, hurry!

1502
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:40,120
We can't go anywhere.

1503
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:42,120
We have to sit right here so they can see us.

1504
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:46,120
Yeah, otherwise they might lose one of us.

1505
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:50,120
What a lot of signs, no walking on grass, no shouting, no running!

1506
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:52,120
What a lot of rules!

1507
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:54,120
What are they good for, Snuffkin?

1508
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,120
Nothing, nothing at all.

1509
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:58,120
And that's why we're going to pull them up.

1510
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:00,120
No, you mustn't.

1511
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,120
I don't think one is allowed to do that.

1512
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:04,120
And you have to walk on the grass.

1513
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,120
Yes indeed.

1514
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,120
And I really like walking on the grass.

1515
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:10,120
I always have.

1516
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:12,120
No buts.

1517
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:14,120
Come on everybody, let's make a start.

1518
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:22,120
That looks like fun, I'll pull some too.

1519
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,120
What are you doing?

1520
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:28,120
Can't you read, there's a sign saying it's forbidden to pull up times?

1521
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:30,120
This one?

1522
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,120
Yes!

1523
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,120
Oh, oh, sir!

1524
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:36,120
Oh!

1525
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:38,120
Oh!

1526
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:40,120
Oh!

1527
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,120
Oh!

1528
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:44,120
Oh!

1529
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:46,120
I'm beautiful, sir!

1530
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:48,120
Bye bye!

1531
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,120
Oh!

1532
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:52,120
Oh!

1533
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:54,120
There you free, go run!

1534
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:56,120
Okay!

1535
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:02,120
Stop!

1536
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:04,120
Wait!

1537
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,120
Oh!

1538
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:08,120
What an awesome pose!

1539
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:10,120
My goodness!

1540
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:12,120
Those little balls are shining!

1541
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,120
Oh!

1542
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:16,120
Oh!

1543
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:18,120
Oh!

1544
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:20,120
That hurts!

1545
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:22,120
Wait, right, those were howdy fat receipts.

1546
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:24,120
Come on everybody, run!

1547
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:32,120
Oh, get out of here!

1548
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:34,120
Someone help!

1549
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:36,120
Someone help!

1550
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:38,120
They're after me!

1551
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:40,120
Get down! Get away!

1552
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,120
Quick!

1553
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:44,120
They're terrible!

1554
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:48,120
Where could that floating theater have gone?

1555
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:52,120
They're still following us!

1556
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:58,120
Come on, you kids, you can go wherever you want!

1557
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:00,120
Do what you like!

1558
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:02,120
Yeah, but I don't know what I want!

1559
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:04,120
Me neither!

1560
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,120
I think they want to go with you, Snuffkin!

1561
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:08,120
But I don't know anything about small children.

1562
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:10,120
I'm not sure I even like them!

1563
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:12,120
All we have to do is find a theater!

1564
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:14,120
Mum and Mama will know what to do!

1565
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:16,120
In that case, let's go!

1566
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:40,120
A house!

1567
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:42,120
The lights are on!

1568
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,120
Maybe they're celebrating with some relief!

1569
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:46,120
Shall we go there?

1570
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:48,120
Yes!

1571
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:02,120
Oh!

1572
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,120
At last!

1573
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:06,120
Oh!

1574
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:08,120
Hello, happy midsummer!

1575
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:10,120
What can I do for you?

1576
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:12,120
Would you have seen a theater drifting around somewhere, ma'am?

1577
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:14,120
A theater?

1578
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,120
Yes, you see a drifted away in the flood!

1579
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:18,120
And my powers are on it!

1580
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:20,120
Oh dear, I haven't seen anything like that!

1581
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:22,120
Oh, what a pity!

1582
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:24,120
Thank you! We'll look elsewhere!

1583
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:26,120
Have a nice midsummer party!

1584
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,120
Party?

1585
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:30,120
Oh yes, a party!

1586
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:32,120
Thank you very much!

1587
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:34,120
Very well then, I'll say goodnight!

1588
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:40,120
Did we say something wrong, Mum?

1589
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:42,120
I don't know!

1590
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:54,120
What's the matter?

1591
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:56,120
I think she's crying!

1592
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:58,120
Oh!

1593
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:00,120
Hello!

1594
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:02,120
Is there anything we can do, anything at all?

1595
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,120
Aren't you having a party, ma'am?

1596
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:06,120
No, unfortunately, she's not coming this year either!

1597
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:08,120
Who is she?

1598
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:10,120
My aunt and my father's side!

1599
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:14,120
I invite her every year for a midsummer party, but she never comes!

1600
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:16,120
How sad! You must be very fond of her!

1601
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:18,120
Oh no! She's an awful person!

1602
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:22,120
If that's how you feel about her, why don't you invite someone else?

1603
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:26,120
She's my only relative!

1604
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,120
So invite someone who isn't a relative?

1605
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:32,120
Yes, why don't you invite us, for instance?

1606
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,120
Can one really do things like that?

1607
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,120
Just like that?

1608
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:38,120
Of course one can!

1609
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:40,120
Oh, how marvelous!

1610
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:44,120
To be perfectly honest, we're very hungry!

1611
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,120
I've made lots of extra pancakes!

1612
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:48,120
Please come in and join me!

1613
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,120
Thank you!

1614
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:54,120
Although we have drifted apart tonight, is midsummer's eve?

1615
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:58,120
Let's drink a toast to Mum and Snork Maiden and Little Mai

1616
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:00,120
and hope that they're safe!

1617
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:04,120
And we better drink to that no-good niece of mine, I guess!

1618
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,120
Who's that Emma?

1619
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,120
My only relative!

1620
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,120
She lives all alone in a small house by the sea!

1621
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:12,120
Oh, is she all alone for midsummer?

1622
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:16,120
Probably! I always invite me over for pancakes!

1623
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:18,120
I don't like relatives and I don't like pancakes!

1624
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,120
And she's boring, so I don't go!

1625
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,120
Well, let's toast her anyway!

1626
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:26,120
And here's hoping we'll all be together again very soon!

1627
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:28,120
Cheers!

1628
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:32,120
Oh, that was really good!

1629
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:34,120
Everything was delicious!

1630
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:36,120
I think I've eaten too much!

1631
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:38,120
Oh, please have some more!

1632
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:40,120
Oh, this is so nice!

1633
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:42,120
I couldn't eat another thing!

1634
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,120
It's such fun having someone to cook for!

1635
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:46,120
I'm so pleased you're not at my door!

1636
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:48,120
All that's missing now is a bonfire!

1637
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:52,120
We always have one on midsummer eve!

1638
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:54,120
What a good idea! Let's have one!

1639
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,120
Over there!

1640
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:00,120
Over there!

1641
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:02,120
Over there!

1642
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:04,120
Over there!

1643
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:06,120
So happy!

1644
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:08,120
So glad you came!

1645
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:10,120
See these?

1646
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:12,120
The flood brought all of them!

1647
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:14,120
They were lying all over the place!

1648
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:16,120
So I tied them into one big pile!

1649
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:18,120
Would they make a good bonfire?

1650
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:20,120
Oh, a terrific one!

1651
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:22,120
Definitely!

1652
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:30,120
Oh, wow!

1653
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,120
We've walked for miles,

1654
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:52,120
but I can't see signs of a theater anywhere!

1655
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:54,120
Oh, don't worry! We'll find it soon!

1656
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:56,120
Huh?

1657
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:58,120
And what's the matter with you?

1658
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,120
I'm hungry!

1659
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:02,120
Me too!

1660
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:04,120
I can't walk anymore!

1661
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:06,120
We don't have any food if you want food!

1662
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:08,120
You'll have to look for yourselves!

1663
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:12,120
Oh, don't cry!

1664
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,120
Look over there, little lion!

1665
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:16,120
What?

1666
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:18,120
Over there!

1667
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,120
And the lights are on!

1668
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:22,120
We're safe!

1669
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,120
We're safe!

1670
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:30,120
We're safe!

1671
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:32,120
We're safe!

1672
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:34,120
We're safe!

1673
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:36,120
We're safe!

1674
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:38,120
We're safe!

1675
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:40,120
We're safe!

1676
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:42,120
We're safe!

1677
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:44,120
Oh!

1678
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,120
Hey kids!

1679
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:48,120
You can't go eating other people's food!

1680
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,120
You can if they are home,

1681
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:52,120
and it's just what's left over from a party!

1682
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:54,120
In fact, I will have some myself!

1683
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:56,120
It's amazing! I'm always so black!

1684
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:58,120
Now we must pick nine flowers!

1685
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:00,120
Why is that Snorke-Middon?

1686
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:04,120
I don't really know! It's always nine or seven of something!

1687
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:06,120
Okay, nine flowers!

1688
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:08,120
No, not the same kind!

1689
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:10,120
You must pick nine different flowers!

1690
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:12,120
And then what do you do?

1691
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:14,120
You turn around seven times like this!

1692
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:16,120
And then what do you do?

1693
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:18,120
You turn around seven times like this!

1694
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,120
And then what do you do?

1695
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:22,120
You turn around seven times like this!

1696
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:24,120
And then what do you do?

1697
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:26,120
You turn around seven times like this!

1698
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:28,120
I get it!

1699
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:46,120
And then you walk backward until you reach a well!

1700
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:50,120
And then when you look down into the well,

1701
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:54,120
there you'll see the man you're going to marry!

1702
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,120
How did I get him up?

1703
01:40:56,120 --> 01:41:00,120
I think I see him! What a clever well!

1704
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:02,120
That I must try!

1705
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:16,120
I'd like someone more romantic!

1706
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:18,120
Got you!

1707
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:20,120
What are you doing?

1708
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:22,120
I'm quietly now!

1709
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:26,120
Oh, all we did is pick some unprotected wild flowers!

1710
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,120
I know what you did!

1711
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:30,120
Hey, Snorke-Middon!

1712
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:32,120
Moon!

1713
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:34,120
Ha! You know each other! That makes it conspiracy!

1714
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:36,120
But I tell you, we've done nothing wrong! Nothing at all!

1715
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:38,120
We were only celebrating!

1716
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:40,120
Better for you, if you hadn't!

1717
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:42,120
But why? Can't you light a bonfire here, sir?

1718
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:46,120
I must warn you that all you say will be used against you!

1719
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:50,120
Yes, yes! I have a complaint from the parkkeeper!

1720
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,120
You pulled up these signs from his park, and you burnt them!

1721
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:54,120
That's not true!

1722
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:58,120
It is true that we burnt them, sir, but we didn't take them from any park!

1723
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:00,120
They were brought here by the flood!

1724
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:02,120
Older-dash! Here's the evidence!

1725
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:06,120
I've caught you, and that's that!

1726
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:14,120
Oh, I caught something!

1727
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:16,120
Oh, it's just a piece of wood!

1728
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:18,120
Had any ideas here?

1729
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:20,120
Not a single one! How about you, Mama?

1730
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:22,120
Same here, I'm afraid!

1731
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:26,120
I just can't seem to think of anything at all!

1732
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:36,120
You wouldn't have any ideas about what we should do next, would you, Emma?

1733
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:38,120
About what?

1734
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:42,120
Some ideas about how to let the children know where we are, of course!

1735
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:44,120
How does anyone know where a theater is?

1736
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:46,120
I don't know!

1737
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:48,120
Please tell us!

1738
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:50,120
Well, you put on a play!

1739
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:52,120
A play?

1740
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:54,120
Yes, that is correct!

1741
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:58,120
This is a theater, and when you put on a new play, everybody comes flocking to see it!

1742
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:00,120
They come to laugh, to cry, to shout, and to applaud!

1743
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:04,120
And when your children hear of it, they will be hearing a flash!

1744
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:06,120
What a splendid idea, Emma!

1745
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:08,120
That's exactly what we'll do!

1746
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:10,120
Hmm, I'm sorry, we can't put on a play!

1747
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:12,120
Why not?

1748
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:16,120
We have no actors! They are pests, but one can't do without them!

1749
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:18,120
I can be one!

1750
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:20,120
And I'm also quite good at acting!

1751
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:22,120
I can act very well!

1752
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:26,120
There are only three of you, and not one of you is an experienced professional actor!

1753
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:28,120
Don't forget, we have you, Emma!

1754
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:30,120
Me?

1755
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:36,120
Well, I've always felt that I would make a rather good Shakespearean heroine!

1756
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:40,120
And we can each have many parts, as long as they're not all on the stage at the same time!

1757
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,120
He isn't at so moment, Papa!

1758
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:44,120
Of course, it's possible to do it!

1759
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:46,120
I want the part that finds the treasure!

1760
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:50,120
No, that's impossible, we have no play!

1761
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,120
Nothing simple enough for the likes of you!

1762
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:56,120
A moment, Papa, can write one, he's very talented!

1763
01:43:56,120 --> 01:44:00,120
No trouble at all, my dear, any number of acts!

1764
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:02,120
But we don't want any number, we want three acts!

1765
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:05,120
That's what all proper plays always have, moment, Papa!

1766
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:07,120
Let's start right away!

1767
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:09,120
We got to print posters!

1768
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,120
And clean the stage!

1769
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:13,120
Whatever advice started!

1770
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:21,120
And this was how Woman Papa got started on a short career as a playwright!

1771
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:45,120
But while the birds carry news of the play far and wide,

1772
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:55,120
what has to become of Woman and Snork Maiden?

1773
01:44:55,120 --> 01:45:01,120
Their troubles are real ones!

1774
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:17,120
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements!

1775
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:25,120
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements!

1776
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:29,120
They're always happy and goes at play!

1777
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:33,120
The movements are having fun day after day!

1778
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:37,120
The movements!

1779
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:41,120
The movements!

1780
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:47,120
The movements!

1781
01:45:55,120 --> 01:46:05,120
Here they are for one and all!

1782
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:15,120
The movements are about to come!

1783
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:19,120
Come on and sit down here with me!

1784
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:21,120
They're for you on your TV!

1785
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:25,120
They are the movements!

1786
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:27,120
They are the movements!

1787
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:29,120
So come with me!

1788
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:31,120
Give me your hand!

1789
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:33,120
I'll take you up to a moment land!

1790
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:37,120
You can fly just like a bird!

1791
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:39,120
Sing that song ever!

1792
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:41,120
There were the movements!

1793
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:45,120
There were the movements!

1794
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:49,120
There were the movements!

1795
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:53,120
There were the movements!

1796
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:57,120
There were the movements!

1797
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:07,120
All over moving down, bits of paper were fluttering down!

1798
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:09,120
What are you sewing?

1799
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,120
How are you sewing?

1800
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:13,120
Let us know!

1801
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:17,120
They were even falling over the lake!

1802
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:21,120
What's this?

1803
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:23,120
Oh, litter!

1804
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:25,120
There's some writing on that piece of paper!

1805
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:27,120
I think it's a message!

1806
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:29,120
Let's see!

1807
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:33,120
Moment, theatre presents, written by Moment Papa!

1808
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,120
Moment, Papa!

1809
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:37,120
The last children of Moment Valley!

1810
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:41,120
Starring Moment Papa, Moment Mama, and Sniff!

1811
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:43,120
And introducing Emma!

1812
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:45,120
Emma?

1813
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,120
It works in a theatre!

1814
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:49,120
Admission fee!

1815
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:51,120
Anything edible!

1816
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:53,120
They're putting on a play!

1817
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:57,120
So they can't be lost!

1818
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:59,120
I haven't seen a play since I was a kid!

1819
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:01,120
It was wonderful!

1820
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:03,120
The best play ever!

1821
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:05,120
All about a princess!

1822
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:07,120
She fell asleep in a rose bush!

1823
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:09,120
She was so lovely!

1824
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:11,120
I've got to see that one again!

1825
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:13,120
But who will guard my prisoners, I wonder?

1826
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:15,120
I'm a good idea, officer!

1827
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:19,120
You could take the three of us with you to the theatre to see the play!

1828
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:21,120
Good idea!

1829
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:23,120
We love the theatre, so we won't try to run away, officer!

1830
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:25,120
I promise!

1831
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:27,120
Hmm, not possible!

1832
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:29,120
I won't let you out of this jail until you write out!

1833
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:33,120
It's forbidden to burn signs 5,000 times each!

1834
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:35,120
That's the punishment for vandals!

1835
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:39,120
Well, in that case, you won't be able to see the play!

1836
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:41,120
Ah, who cares?

1837
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:43,120
I'll go!

1838
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:45,120
Yes, I must see it, I must go!

1839
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:47,120
So you'll take us with you?

1840
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:49,120
No, you stay right here!

1841
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:51,120
Well, then you can't go either, officer!

1842
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:53,120
Quiet! You're upsetting me!

1843
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:57,120
No, no! This isn't good enough! It's not true drama!

1844
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:59,120
Ah, please, moment, papa!

1845
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:01,120
I don't want to be just a lion's ugly behind!

1846
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:03,120
But, Sniff, I did give you another part!

1847
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:05,120
I don't want to be a baby either!

1848
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:09,120
And she said you wanted parts without lines!

1849
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:11,120
You're the dusting a bit later, Emma, please!

1850
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:13,120
He's script should be ready now!

1851
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:17,120
We have to start practicing for the opening night tomorrow morning!

1852
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:19,120
Don't worry, Emma, it's coming along!

1853
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:21,120
I'm only half done!

1854
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:23,120
I shall never get ready in time, moment, mama!

1855
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:25,120
You're right to worry!

1856
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,120
For the curtain will rise tomorrow, no matter what!

1857
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:29,120
Ha, ha, ha!

1858
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:33,120
Women papa will remember to give Emma lots and lots of lines!

1859
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:37,120
She's really looking forward to her first performance!

1860
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:41,120
Now, leave me, I must be left alone to concentrate!

1861
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:43,120
The writer needs peace and quiet!

1862
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:47,120
There are some things I don't like about this script!

1863
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:49,120
I'll discuss it with you after the performance, Sniff!

1864
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:51,120
After!

1865
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:55,120
If it's a story about lost children, why do you have to have a stupid lion?

1866
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:59,120
I'm too good an actor to be cast as a lion!

1867
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:01,120
Keith, I'm out of my hair!

1868
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:03,120
He's giving me a headache!

1869
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:05,120
You come with me, Sniff! We'll practice our parts!

1870
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:09,120
This could be a wonderful play if you'd only skip the lions behind!

1871
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:13,120
I've heard enough about this behind!

1872
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:17,120
Remember, we have a lion's head too, dying to show his acting skills on the stage!

1873
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:21,120
This is my play, and I refuse to write out the lion's butt!

1874
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:23,120
I refuse!

1875
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:30,120
Here's the key! I want you to keep a keen eye on them until I come back!

1876
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:32,120
Do you understand me, cousin?

1877
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:34,120
Are they very dangerous?

1878
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:38,120
Yes, they certainly are! They bite if you let them out!

1879
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:40,120
We certainly wouldn't bite anyone, obviously!

1880
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:42,120
I've had enough of your lies!

1881
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:44,120
Don't listen to my dear cousin, they do!

1882
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:48,120
Well then, now I'm up to the theater to see the play!

1883
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:50,120
Take good care of them while I'm gone!

1884
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:52,120
Excuse me! You seem to be a very good knitter!

1885
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:54,120
Oh, thank you!

1886
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:56,120
Nobody ever said that to me before! I enjoy it!

1887
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:58,120
What are you making?

1888
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:00,120
I'm not sure! I don't really know!

1889
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:02,120
Nothing in particular!

1890
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:04,120
It's just that, knitting!

1891
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:06,120
I'm not sure!

1892
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:08,120
I'm not sure!

1893
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:10,120
I'm not sure!

1894
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:12,120
I'm not sure!

1895
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:14,120
I'm not sure!

1896
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:16,120
I don't really know!

1897
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,120
Nothing in particular!

1898
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:22,120
It's just that knitting is so reassuring somehow!

1899
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:25,120
Nothing bad can happen while you knit, can it?

1900
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:30,120
The trouble is I always seem to forget to decide what to make before I start!

1901
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:35,120
But it feels nice and warm and I love the color!

1902
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:38,120
Couldn't you make socks? It's a very nice sock color!

1903
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:40,120
Socks?

1904
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:43,120
Yes, it's very, very cold in here!

1905
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:47,120
Oh, yes! That's a very good idea!

1906
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:52,120
Listen, if I knitted each one of you a pair of warm socks,

1907
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:54,120
would you really put them on?

1908
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,120
Of course!

1909
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:56,120
Of course!

1910
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:57,120
That would be nice!

1911
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:59,120
I'm almost freezing to death in here!

1912
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:01,120
It's so very, very cold!

1913
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:03,120
Is it really that cold?

1914
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:05,120
Yes! My teeth are chattery!

1915
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:06,120
So I could hardly talk!

1916
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:08,120
Honestly!

1917
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:10,120
Oh, dear, dear!

1918
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:12,120
What should I do?

1919
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:16,120
Maybe some steaming hot black currant juice would help to warm us up a little?

1920
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:21,120
Possibly, although it might already be too late!

1921
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:41,120
My cousin would be very angry with me if he knew, but I think...

1922
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:43,120
But you think why?

1923
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:47,120
I think I'll let you out so that we can all be nice and warm indoors!

1924
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:48,120
Really?

1925
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:54,120
Don't cry now, baby!

1926
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:56,120
That's a good boy!

1927
01:52:56,120 --> 01:53:00,120
Don't cry, honey! That's enough, baby!

1928
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:06,120
Whoa!

1929
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:10,120
Oh, woman mama, you need to show much more emotion!

1930
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:13,120
Try to be more motherly and more loving!

1931
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:16,120
Listen to her, this is a very happy baby!

1932
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:18,120
How am I doing, woman papa?

1933
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:22,120
You're just perfect for the part sniffing your performance was excellent!

1934
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:24,120
Whoa!

1935
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:27,120
Maybe I should add a part with some lines in it!

1936
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:29,120
Whoa!

1937
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:31,120
Whoa!

1938
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:34,120
Whoa!

1939
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:44,120
Look at these! I think they might be ready by now!

1940
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:47,120
I hope they're tasty! They don't always come out very well!

1941
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:50,120
You're so kind! We've had so much already!

1942
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:52,120
But they smell really delicious!

1943
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:54,120
They sure do!

1944
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:55,120
Thank you so much!

1945
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:57,120
Now I feel warm again!

1946
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:59,120
How about some more black currant juice?

1947
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:01,120
Or maybe one of these freshly baked cookies?

1948
01:54:01,120 --> 01:54:03,120
It's very kind of you, but no thank you!

1949
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:06,120
I couldn't eat another thing I'm so full up!

1950
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:08,120
Me too!

1951
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:11,120
Oh dear, the party is over then!

1952
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:14,120
I'm afraid so!

1953
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:17,120
It's really sad, but I have to lock you up again!

1954
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:19,120
But at least I know you're warm in there!

1955
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:24,120
We're really sorry too, but you don't need to worry because actually we're not going back to jail!

1956
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:26,120
Oh, aren't you?

1957
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:30,120
We've got other plans! We're going to the theatre! You see my parents play!

1958
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:34,120
And I suppose I should say hello to my Aunt Emma, who works there!

1959
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:39,120
Oh, what shall I do? My cousin will be very cross with me!

1960
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:43,120
But you see, we're innocent! We didn't do anything wrong!

1961
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:44,120
You didn't?

1962
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:46,120
I swear it!

1963
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:49,120
Do I look like someone who pulls up signs in a park?

1964
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:52,120
We just burned some flats and left by the flood!

1965
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:54,120
But your cousin wouldn't believe it!

1966
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:57,120
He jumped to conclusions, wrongful arrest!

1967
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:59,120
That's all it was!

1968
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:02,120
Oh dear, why didn't you tell me that it was?

1969
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:06,120
Ah, people shouldn't go to jail when they haven't done anything wrong!

1970
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:09,120
Ah, so we can go to the theatre, is that okay?

1971
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:11,120
Of course, better leave right away!

1972
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:15,120
My cousin will be very disappointed, but I guess I can't be helped!

1973
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:17,120
Wait for me!

1974
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:23,120
I think I'd better come along and explain to that cousin of mine that his three prisoners are innocent of the charge against them!

1975
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:29,120
That's all right, all right, bring it in!

1976
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:32,120
Eh, that's right, Mum! Papa, stop there!

1977
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:33,120
Okay, sniff!

1978
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:36,120
Mum and Mama, what have you got there?

1979
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:39,120
A baby's crib! I want to use this in the play!

1980
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:41,120
If that's all right with you!

1981
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:43,120
Mum and Papa! Mum and Papa!

1982
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:46,120
I've just read your script and I think you have a big problem!

1983
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:50,120
Who is going to pay the parts of Mum and Snork Maiden in this play of yours?

1984
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:55,120
I don't know yet, we don't have any more children and Sniff can't take the part!

1985
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:57,120
Are you utterly mad?

1986
01:55:57,120 --> 01:56:02,120
We only have a few hours before the curtain goes up and you don't even have actors for all the part!

1987
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:04,120
What kind of director is that?

1988
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:07,120
Maybe one of us could stand behind something and sort of read their lines!

1989
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:09,120
Wait, thank you! I did it!

1990
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:11,120
Let's hope the credits are proud!

1991
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:18,120
Hold on tight, all of you!

1992
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:20,120
No!

1993
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:28,120
Listen kids, you can be as noisy as you like out here but once we're at the dinner you have to be quiet!

1994
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:30,120
You understand me right?

1995
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:51,120
The audience is waiting for us!

1996
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:13,120
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for giving up your valuable time in order to come to our show tonight!

1997
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:16,120
The world premiere of the Lost Children!

1998
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:19,120
This is a brand new company and the players never been performed before!

1999
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:23,120
Ladies and gentlemen, sit back and enjoy the superb acting!

2000
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:24,120
What's that?

2001
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:26,120
A baby's cradle, it's for you Sniff!

2002
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:27,120
For me?

2003
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:31,120
We sincerely hope you'll be thrilled by the originality of the plot!

2004
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:34,120
And so now dear friends, let's get started!

2005
01:57:34,120 --> 01:57:36,120
Let's get started!

2006
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:40,120
Come on!

2007
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:44,120
Come on, come on!

2008
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:46,120
Oh, thank you, gentlemen!

2009
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:51,120
There's a good boy, don't cry honey!

2010
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:53,120
Please, don't cry!

2011
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:59,120
Hmm, oh, moment, snork maiden, my darling children!

2012
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:03,120
You've been lost for a whole month and we haven't heard a word from either of you!

2013
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:05,120
Oh, he's forgotten all about me!

2014
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:06,120
Shh!

2015
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:12,120
I'd give the whole world to be rid of this most terrible agonizing despair!

2016
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:20,120
Oh, I'll make your husband try not to fret, so I'm sure he'll be back before very long!

2017
01:58:20,120 --> 01:58:23,120
Little children, come and free me from this plight!

2018
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:27,120
Your mother worries all day through the baby's awake all night!

2019
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:30,120
Come home, come home, my children too!

2020
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:33,120
With all our hearts, we're missing you!

2021
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:37,120
Hmm?

2022
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:39,120
Loud or Sniff?

2023
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:41,120
Oh, well, mama!

2024
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:43,120
But what's wrong with you, Sniff?

2025
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:45,120
This rocket's making me sick!

2026
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:48,120
Oh dear, and right in the middle of movement, Papa's play!

2027
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:50,120
Oh, oh!

2028
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:54,120
Mama, let us set forth and find our loved ones!

2029
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:57,120
We cannot leave our baby here!

2030
01:58:57,120 --> 01:59:00,120
Oh, anyone would love to have him sweet little thing!

2031
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:03,120
For how long, pray, do you think we would be gone?

2032
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:08,120
For as long as it takes, I can no longer stand being this frightfully upset about my children!

2033
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:11,120
Oh, baby!

2034
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:14,120
Yeah!

2035
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:22,120
Hurry up, Sniff!

2036
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:24,120
I'm trying!

2037
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:28,120
Hurry, scene two is about to start!

2038
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:31,120
Help me, somebody! I can't get out of here!

2039
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:33,120
When do they put the princess on?

2040
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:35,120
We still have very far to go.

2041
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:37,120
I'm afraid so hurry, movement!

2042
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:38,120
I am hurrying!

2043
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:39,120
It's for bitten!

2044
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:40,120
It's for bitten!

2045
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:41,120
It's for bitten!

2046
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:42,120
It's for bitten!

2047
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:44,120
What are you writing on that paper?

2048
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:46,120
My cousin won't give up, I'm sure!

2049
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:48,120
So I better write this 5,000 times!

2050
01:59:48,120 --> 01:59:49,120
It's for bitten!

2051
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:50,120
It's for bitten!

2052
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:51,120
It's for bitten!

2053
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:52,120
It's for bitten!

2054
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:57,120
A full two weeks has passed!

2055
01:59:57,120 --> 01:59:59,120
Oh, what shall we do?

2056
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:03,120
Our dear children have disappeared from the face of the Earth!

2057
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:06,120
Oh, what happened, dear Apple, of my heart?

2058
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:10,120
I think I sprained my hands really badly.

2059
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:11,120
Oh, it hurts!

2060
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:15,120
If you were in trouble, apart from the wolves, we're all alone!

2061
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:16,120
I'll put you out!

2062
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:18,120
Stop!

2063
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:19,120
Stop!

2064
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:21,120
Why must this happen in my theater?

2065
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:23,120
I've been squeezed in here to make me look smaller!

2066
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:24,120
Help!

2067
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:25,120
I'm trying to!

2068
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:27,120
We can't have the lion on stage without his behind!

2069
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:29,120
Wow!

2070
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:30,120
I'm so new!

2071
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:31,120
Come on!

2072
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:32,120
Wow!

2073
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:33,120
Wow!

2074
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:38,120
We have to face the worst and spend the night right here in the wilderness!

2075
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:40,120
Dear husband, will it be all right?

2076
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:43,120
Fairly in these unhulled woods, I feel quite greasy!

2077
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:50,120
Sweet wife, I too can smell those frightful beasts, howling for a blood!

2078
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:53,120
May not just smell them, dear!

2079
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:55,120
Anything that I can hear them now!

2080
02:00:58,120 --> 02:01:00,120
I can hear the howling of those hungry beasts!

2081
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:03,120
Wow!

2082
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:07,120
Paint is the roar, but I can make it out a lion!

2083
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:08,120
Wow!

2084
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:10,120
Oh!

2085
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:16,120
Oh, sniff, what's up?

2086
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:18,120
Where are you going, dear?

2087
02:01:18,120 --> 02:01:26,120
Oh, listen, I have to go and stop that stupid lion who's roaming around the countryside watching our every move.

2088
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:30,120
Hey, don't worry, I'll be right back, my dear.

2089
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:32,120
Was he supposed to say that?

2090
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:35,120
Hey, what are you doing here, you're supposed to be on stage?

2091
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:38,120
It's not my father, he's stuck in his crib!

2092
02:01:38,120 --> 02:01:41,120
Woman mama stuck on stage, raw lion!

2093
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:48,120
That lion sounds very close, my husband must be in great danger!

2094
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:50,120
All right, under that stage, both of you.

2095
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:58,120
Papa, I can't get this thing off, I feel sick!

2096
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:03,120
Ah, what are you doing, woman papa?

2097
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:05,120
You can do it with a cradle on, sniff.

2098
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:10,120
No, I can't stop it, please don't do it, woman papa, laugh at me out there!

2099
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:14,120
Don't worry, nobody knows it's you hiding in there.

2100
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:16,120
Come on now, hurry!

2101
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:23,120
Ah, lion, a lion is this to be my most untimely end?

2102
02:02:30,120 --> 02:02:33,120
Don't you dare laugh at me!

2103
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:41,120
Whoa, is that lion gonna eat, woman mama?

2104
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:44,120
Oh no, what might you do?

2105
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:46,120
What should I do, woman papa?

2106
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:48,120
I'm scared, can't be bothered to pee!

2107
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:51,120
Just run off across the stage, dear!

2108
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:53,120
We were supposed to run off together!

2109
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:58,120
The situation has changed, I'll have to come to your rescue some other time, dear!

2110
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:01,120
Oh, help me out!

2111
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:07,120
Oh, help me so much, please!

2112
02:03:07,120 --> 02:03:10,120
Please, hold out, everyone!

2113
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:12,120
I can't really see it!

2114
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:22,120
Help me, please!

2115
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:25,120
Someone, come quickly before I get killed!

2116
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:26,120
Oh!

2117
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:29,120
Help me, woman mama!

2118
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:35,120
Help me!

2119
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:42,120
Oh, it's only snap!

2120
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:45,120
Little Maya, I'm so glad you're all right!

2121
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:48,120
Shirley, weren't worried about me, woman mama?

2122
02:03:48,120 --> 02:03:52,120
Well, just a little maybe, but you're such a lucky girl, I knew you'd manage.

2123
02:03:52,120 --> 02:03:53,120
Mama!

2124
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:54,120
Mama!

2125
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:55,120
I don't believe it!

2126
02:03:55,120 --> 02:03:56,120
Mama!

2127
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:57,120
It's me, woman!

2128
02:03:57,120 --> 02:03:59,120
And it's me snorting me in!

2129
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:00,120
Mama!

2130
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:01,120
Papa!

2131
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:03,120
Moments snorting me in!

2132
02:04:03,120 --> 02:04:05,120
Is it really you?

2133
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:07,120
Come here and let me see you!

2134
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:12,120
We've come back, mama!

2135
02:04:12,120 --> 02:04:14,120
I was dying to see you!

2136
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:16,120
Oh, it's wonderful to have you back!

2137
02:04:16,120 --> 02:04:18,120
Isn't that my niece?

2138
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:20,120
And Emma!

2139
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:21,120
Oh!

2140
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:23,120
You look so grown up!

2141
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:28,120
And Emma, so sorry to have missed your show, but I have so much to tell you!

2142
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:32,120
Hi, everybody!

2143
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:34,120
That was a great performance!

2144
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:36,120
Snortkin, I'm so glad to see you!

2145
02:04:36,120 --> 02:04:37,120
Glad you're safe, woman!

2146
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:38,120
Help me!

2147
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:39,120
Hey!

2148
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:41,120
Those are my prisoners!

2149
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:43,120
They've escaped from jail!

2150
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:44,120
Catch them!

2151
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:47,120
No, cousin!

2152
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:50,120
I let them out because they swear they're innocent!

2153
02:04:50,120 --> 02:04:53,120
They didn't pull up a single one of those signs!

2154
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:54,120
That's right!

2155
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:56,120
I was the one who did that deliberately!

2156
02:04:56,120 --> 02:04:58,120
And I helped him!

2157
02:04:58,120 --> 02:04:59,120
Very well!

2158
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:00,120
You're both under arrest!

2159
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:01,120
No!

2160
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:02,120
No!

2161
02:05:02,120 --> 02:05:04,120
No!

2162
02:05:04,120 --> 02:05:06,120
Who are these dreadful children?

2163
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:07,120
Dear, dear cousin.

2164
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:11,120
It's forbidden, it's forbidden.

2165
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:14,120
Five thousand times, that's what you wanted.

2166
02:05:14,120 --> 02:05:16,120
And are you sure there are five thousand?

2167
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:17,120
Oh, yes, quite sure.

2168
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:19,120
I've counted them.

2169
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:22,120
One, two, three, four.

2170
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:24,120
Now that we are all together again,

2171
02:05:24,120 --> 02:05:27,120
I would really like to go back to Moomin Valley.

2172
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:29,120
What shall we do with all these little pests?

2173
02:05:29,120 --> 02:05:30,120
Snortkin?

2174
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:31,120
Well, little Mai.

2175
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:33,120
Someone might like to foster them.

2176
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:36,120
You can leave them in my car, sir.

2177
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:38,120
And yours, Emma?

2178
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:39,120
Yes!

2179
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:41,120
Now I have some acting experience.

2180
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:43,120
I think I would like to start an acting school,

2181
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:45,120
exactly what this theater needs.

2182
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:46,120
What a good idea!

2183
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:48,120
Do you think I would be too old to attend?

2184
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:50,120
Perhaps character parts.

2185
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:51,120
Like in my play.

2186
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:54,120
All is arranged for the best, so now we can go home.

2187
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:57,120
It is Moomin Papa, I think it's high time.

2188
02:05:57,120 --> 02:06:00,120
Quiet, please, I've lost my cap.

2189
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:03,120
Now I'll have to start again right from the beginning.

2190
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:06,120
Moomin Papa, do you think we should thank the audience

2191
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:09,120
for their patience because they're still watching us, you know?

2192
02:06:10,120 --> 02:06:12,120
No, you're right.

2193
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:16,120
Ladies and gentlemen, that's all for tonight.

2194
02:06:16,120 --> 02:06:19,120
I hope you have enjoyed the performance.

2195
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:23,120
I think it was very kind of you to stay to the very end.

2196
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:38,120
Sometimes I could almost believe the truth is strange

2197
02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:40,120
or the fiction of it.

2198
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:42,120
Well, it is, isn't it, Moomin Papa?

2199
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:46,120
No, not really, we writers are no better.

2200
02:06:46,120 --> 02:06:48,120
Go write more plays.

2201
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:51,120
Oh, what a very good idea, Moomin Papa.

2202
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:54,120
I think you're as good with plays as you are with memoirs.

2203
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:55,120
What are you two?

2204
02:06:55,120 --> 02:06:59,120
Right, I'll start on the sequel as soon as we're all back home.

2205
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:05,120
There it is, I lovely home.

2206
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:07,120
At least I got a proper wash.

2207
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:09,120
I've never seen it so clean.

2208
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:10,120
What about in sign?

2209
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:13,120
Oh, redecorated, probably.

2210
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:14,120
Yeah.

2211
02:07:14,120 --> 02:07:15,120
Let's go.

2212
02:07:15,120 --> 02:07:18,120
The Moomin family spent the whole of the following week

2213
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:20,120
making their house cozy and comfortable.

2214
02:07:20,120 --> 02:07:23,120
And soon each carpet, each cup and saucer

2215
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:27,120
and every piece of furniture was back in its proper place once again.

2216
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:45,120
No caring and giving the Moomin's.

2217
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:49,120
They're always happy and goes at play.

2218
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:52,120
The Moomin's are having fun day after day.

2219
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:56,120
The Moomin's.

2220
02:07:56,120 --> 02:08:00,120
The Moomin's.

2221
02:08:00,120 --> 02:08:05,120
The Moomin's.

2222
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:15,120
The Moomin's.

2223
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:45,120
The Moomin's.

2224
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:48,120
They are the Moomin's.

2225
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:51,120
So come with me, give me your hand.

2226
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:54,120
I'll take you up to Moomin land.

2227
02:08:54,120 --> 02:08:57,120
You can fly just like a bird.

2228
02:08:57,120 --> 02:09:00,120
Sing that song ever.

2229
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:05,120
There were the Moomin's.

2230
02:09:05,120 --> 02:09:09,120
There were the Moomin's.

2231
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:14,120
There were the Moomin's.

2232
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:18,120
Bop, bop, bop, bop.

2233
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:28,120
One night, Moomin was having a dream.

2234
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:32,120
What a wonderful feeling to be flying like this.

2235
02:09:32,120 --> 02:09:34,120
Look over there, Moomin.

2236
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:36,120
What a beautiful lake.

2237
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:40,120
It's one of the most fantastic experiences I've ever had.

2238
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:41,120
Me too.

2239
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:44,120
I never knew birds had such a marvelous life.

2240
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:48,120
Seeing things from a completely different point of view.

2241
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:51,120
We're flying pretty high, aren't we?

2242
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:53,120
I'm scared.

2243
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:55,120
We're much too high.

2244
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:59,120
Let's go down, please. Let's go down at once.

2245
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:03,120
I'm not scared of heights.

2246
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:07,120
You know, aren't this time you really have succeeded?

2247
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:11,120
Well, I could build hundreds of these if you wanted me to.

2248
02:10:11,120 --> 02:10:14,120
Snork, can I steer just for a little while?

2249
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:16,120
Now you can.

2250
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:18,120
Oh, thank you.

2251
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:23,120
Do you really know how to steer this thing?

2252
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:27,120
Hey, stop it, stinky.

2253
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:30,120
That's dangerous.

2254
02:10:33,120 --> 02:10:36,120
This is okay.

2255
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:40,120
Really? It's just a dream.

2256
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:02,120
Oh gosh, my head hurt so much.

2257
02:11:03,120 --> 02:11:05,120
What a strange dream.

2258
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:08,120
Why would my brother let stinky steer his flying ship?

2259
02:11:08,120 --> 02:11:10,120
Surely not.

2260
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:13,120
I was talking to the snork while I looked away.

2261
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:15,120
Suddenly stinky took his place.

2262
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:17,120
Oh, and then the thing began tilting.

2263
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:20,120
Hmm, but it was just a dream.

2264
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:22,120
I don't care. I don't like it.

2265
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:25,120
You shouldn't have dreams like that just when my brother's flying ship is almost ready.

2266
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:28,120
Dreams often come true, you know.

2267
02:11:28,120 --> 02:11:31,120
But it was nothing like the ship your brother's building.

2268
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:33,120
It was totally different.

2269
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:35,120
But tell me what happened to it in the end.

2270
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:37,120
Did it fall down?

2271
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:38,120
I don't know.

2272
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:41,120
I lost sight of it when I fell off and I didn't see it again.

2273
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:44,120
Well, surely you could have turned your head to take a look.

2274
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:46,120
Well, I didn't.

2275
02:11:46,120 --> 02:11:49,120
Listen, moment, don't say a word to the snork about this.

2276
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:52,120
He's nervous enough as it is.

2277
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:53,120
Of course not.

2278
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:55,120
Why don't we just forget about it?

2279
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:57,120
Pretend it never happened, eh?

2280
02:11:58,120 --> 02:12:01,120
Oh, snork, it's finally completed.

2281
02:12:01,120 --> 02:12:04,120
Sure it is. But it hasn't been flown yet, of course.

2282
02:12:04,120 --> 02:12:06,120
But it will. I won't snork.

2283
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:08,120
You don't think there's anything wrong with it?

2284
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:10,120
Of course not. But it's just...

2285
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:12,120
Is there some problem, snork?

2286
02:12:12,120 --> 02:12:14,120
Well, there might be.

2287
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:16,120
So, what is it?

2288
02:12:16,120 --> 02:12:17,120
Fuel.

2289
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:18,120
Fuel?

2290
02:12:18,120 --> 02:12:21,120
But you said you had developed a new fuel that was really good.

2291
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:23,120
It's good.

2292
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:27,120
But you see, you see, it might not be powerful enough.

2293
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:30,120
You mean it might not be able to fly?

2294
02:12:30,120 --> 02:12:32,120
No, it won't. You're quite right.

2295
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:36,120
Or it will just be an ordinary ship, not a flying ship.

2296
02:12:36,120 --> 02:12:40,120
Oh, that would be nice. What can't go up can't possibly fall down.

2297
02:12:40,120 --> 02:12:46,120
But that's not the point if it won't fly. Everyone will laugh at me. I know they will.

2298
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:48,120
I won't laugh, I promise.

2299
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:50,120
Maybe not. Others will.

2300
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:55,120
But you wouldn't care about that, would you? Who cares what other people think?

2301
02:12:55,120 --> 02:13:00,120
The thing is, I've already told people that the test flight will be quite soon in public.

2302
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:05,120
But I'm sure people will be very nice about it, even if it doesn't get off the ground.

2303
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:08,120
That's hardly what I want.

2304
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:11,120
Moomin, I'd like to ask you a favor.

2305
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:14,120
That's why I sent for you. Will you help me?

2306
02:13:14,120 --> 02:13:17,120
I'll do anything. You ask snork, of course.

2307
02:13:17,120 --> 02:13:21,120
What I would like is for you, Moomin, my friend, to be test pilot for me tomorrow.

2308
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:24,120
You want me to be a pilot?

2309
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:54,120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

2310
02:13:54,120 --> 02:14:24,120
Oh, moment! Listen, Stinky, I'm going to steer that ship. Is that perfectly clear? You're not to touch the wheel. I'm a pilot now. What on earth was that about? Wouldn't you find it difficult to steer it? Oh, no, it's real easy. But of course, I'd need to practice before the public demonstration. Is the snorke going to fly his own ship?

2311
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:54,120
He has to stay down in the engine room, Snuffkin. I wonder if this ship will really fly. The only problem is the fuel. Only the fuel you say. That's a big problem. I suppose so. Listen, moment. Suppose now the snorke's flying ship really gets off the ground. Well, of course, it's going to, Papa. That something could happen. Something could break or you could fall into an air pocket. It's such a dangerous undertaking. Think, moment.

2312
02:14:54,120 --> 02:15:24,120
Now listen, it's not natural for moments to fly about up in the air. Is it snuffkin? Quite right. What would you and the snorke do if things went wrong? We will be wearing parachutes, you know? Parachutes. You do know what they are, don't you, Papa? Of course I do. They come down from the sky like this, like this. Exactly. But of course, we won't need a parachute. Because nothing will go wrong. And I will be the first flying ship pilot.

2313
02:15:24,120 --> 02:15:54,120
Whatever. Oh. Hi there. Hello, my young man. Hello. How do you do? How do you do everybody? Hello, sir. I wonder if you can help me. Do you happen to know where the snorke's factory is? You mean the ship? I must see him. I'm most eager to have a look at his famous flying ship. How do you know about that? It's supposed to be very secret. The information must have leaked out somehow.

2314
02:15:54,120 --> 02:16:24,120
Oh well. All inventors know about what he is trying to do. He's famous throughout Moomin Valley this snorke. Really? Are you an inventor, too? Indeed I am. One of the more famous. I think maybe the most famous of them all. I am Moomin Papa. How do you do, sir? I'm snuffkin. And my name is Moomin. Please to meet you. A very good day to you, one and all. The muffles, my name.

2315
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:54,120
I said I'm the muffle. You mean you've never even heard of me the most famous inventor? Oh yes, I'm sure I am. The muffle isn't it? Yes, it is the muffle. Have you invented anything exciting, muffle, Mr. Muffle? I would be much easier to tell you what I haven't invented, young man. For instance, the pin that can't prick because it has two heads. The newspaper that reads itself the purse that moans and greets me.

2316
02:16:54,120 --> 02:17:24,080
The bronze, if you take money from it, the adhesive tape that sticks only to itself. This is perhaps the greatest of all my latest inventions. Whatever is that? This is proper self a man-powered fan. Infanible in Moomin Valley. All these are my latest inventions.

2317
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:53,080
You didn't know that, did you? No, it isn't. But try and get a handkerchief, the square balloon, the five-wheel car, the hexagonal frying pan, the seven-hole button, and a host of others. Indeed, how interesting. What did you want to see the snork about? I thought I might be able to help him out with one of my inventions. That's what? Oh, dear, which one? My new? No, it's very top-sequence stuff I can't tell you.

2318
02:17:53,560 --> 02:18:07,800
Now, where is the snork's factory? I'll take you right there. Very kind of you. Come, he'll be so surprised. Must be off, see you again. It's a pleasure to help these buddy-inventors. Snork will be so excited.

2319
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:21,240
A famous inventor, eh? What is your opinion, Snuffkin? Have you ever seen a triangular handkerchief, Moomin Papa? No, when I don't want to either. I do wonder what he's cooked up for the snork, though.

2320
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:31,720
It is sort of intriguing. Yes, indeed. Moomin will be able to tell us later, I suppose. Yes, but anything could happen before then. Can we wait that long, Snuffkin? You're right.

2321
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:38,360
No, wait for me. I'm coming with you.

2322
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:47,560
Oh, I thought we had several guests. Now, where in the world are they all gone?

2323
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:53,240
Hmm?

2324
02:18:57,240 --> 02:18:59,240
Hmm?

2325
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:07,240
Now, where are they off to, I wonder?

2326
02:19:13,240 --> 02:19:15,240
Oh, look who's coming!

2327
02:19:21,240 --> 02:19:23,240
What are you doing here?

2328
02:19:23,240 --> 02:19:28,240
We're just interested, then. Where are the muffle and the snork?

2329
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:33,240
The snork and the muffle are discussing some top-secret project. It's very harsh.

2330
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:39,240
Not a triangular handkerchief, I hope. I don't know, Papa. As I said, it's top-secret.

2331
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:41,240
Let's see.

2332
02:19:43,240 --> 02:19:47,240
Oh, bother. The curtains in the way, so I can't see a thing.

2333
02:19:47,240 --> 02:20:01,240
So this is the powerful fuel you've developed, is it, Mr. Muffle? Yes, it is. Not as original as my other inventions, I admit. But very useful. Yes, useful. I call it Super Fuel.

2334
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:05,240
Only trouble is my engine has been designed for liquid fuel.

2335
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:14,240
No problem at all, young man. If you dissolve this block of fuel in 10 litres of water, your engine will run for at least 10 hours.

2336
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:18,240
For 10 whole hours? That's incredible.

2337
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:24,240
If you doubt the word of the muffle, then try it out and see for yourself right now. Right now?

2338
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:31,240
Better still, I guarantee that if used as it is in a solid state, your engine will run not for 10, but for 100 hours.

2339
02:20:31,240 --> 02:20:41,240
100 hours? But that's incredible. You really must be some inventor. Indeed, if what you say is true, it would solve the last problem of my flying ship.

2340
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:48,240
Oh, now that I've looked more closely at the padlock, this store isn't locked. No, it isn't.

2341
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:54,240
So if one wanted to see the snorke, one could work right here. But why would you want to see him, Papa?

2342
02:20:54,240 --> 02:21:02,240
Well, why don't you tell us? I don't want snorke falling for one of the muffles crazy ideas, that's why.

2343
02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:08,240
Well, we'll find out pretty soon. Maybe you don't realise it, but the snorke is pretty clever, you know.

2344
02:21:09,240 --> 02:21:15,240
I think I know exactly what they're doing in there. Yeah, what?

2345
02:21:15,240 --> 02:21:21,240
I saw that man pouring something into the flying ship. What was it? Well, I guess it must have been fuel, movement.

2346
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:27,240
Well, how come you saw him? There's a crack that's just about wide enough for me. But I won't tell you where.

2347
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:35,240
What are those two in there talking about? Oh, yeah. So this is the great super fuel? Wait a minute, snorke. There must be something wrong with it.

2348
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:43,240
What the hell is that? What the hell? There you are. Solid fuel indeed, huh? 100 hours? You're an imposter, sir.

2349
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:51,240
Oh, it isn't true, if you just let me explain. No, thank you. I know very well why you came over here with that ridiculous story.

2350
02:21:51,240 --> 02:22:00,240
Off with you right now. Listen to me. It is not ridiculous, and it is not just a story. Maybe we shouldn't have dissolved it in the water.

2351
02:22:01,240 --> 02:22:09,240
That was a mistake. Imposter, but I'm the muffler. I don't care. Maybe it's just a misunderstanding and the fuel isn't suited for flying ships.

2352
02:22:09,240 --> 02:22:16,240
Wrong, it suits everything. Forget the fuel. That was just a trick so he could come here and get to see my flying ship.

2353
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:24,240
So the muffler has come here to spy, you mean? Ridiculous. I don't steal. Papa, was there anything you wanted to see me about?

2354
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:31,240
No, I just dropped by. No cause for excitement. The fuels are done.

2355
02:22:31,240 --> 02:22:36,240
No, it's not. That's not true. I don't invent guns. What would be the point of inventing them?

2356
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:40,240
Oh, listen to me, please. Let's try and use the fuel once more.

2357
02:22:40,240 --> 02:22:46,240
No, thanks. Once was once too many. I'll have to clean my tanks from your gunge. Get out of my sight.

2358
02:22:55,240 --> 02:23:01,240
Oh dear, this must have been a bit of a disappointment for the snork. I know.

2359
02:23:09,240 --> 02:23:14,240
Now listen, stinky. I'm doing this for the snork sake, isn't that so?

2360
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:19,240
I don't care if you're doing it for all I want is to get a good look at the famous flying ship.

2361
02:23:19,240 --> 02:23:26,240
You'd need something very powerful to get a thing like that off the ground. Something so powerful that only I, the muffler, could ever have invented it.

2362
02:23:26,240 --> 02:23:30,240
Remind me one day to show you my famous triangular handkerchief.

2363
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:35,240
Now all we have to do is not dissolve the fuel in water but use the solid fuel.

2364
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:39,240
Hurry up with that lock, stinky or maybe I should invent a lock pick.

2365
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:43,240
Come on, stinky. Hurry, hurry.

2366
02:23:43,240 --> 02:23:45,240
There you are done.

2367
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:47,240
Good, come. We don't have much time.

2368
02:23:47,240 --> 02:23:51,240
No, I'm dying to steer this ship.

2369
02:23:51,240 --> 02:23:55,240
Me up. Take it up to 2,000 meters.

2370
02:23:55,240 --> 02:23:58,240
Yeah.

2371
02:23:58,240 --> 02:24:03,240
Oh, stinky, stinky. We're flying at a height of just over 2,000 meters now.

2372
02:24:03,240 --> 02:24:05,240
Stinky. Yeah, I'm listening. What is it?

2373
02:24:05,240 --> 02:24:10,240
When you hear me say now, that's when I want you to start off the engine immediately.

2374
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:13,240
All right, no problem. I guess it must be this one.

2375
02:24:13,240 --> 02:24:15,240
No, no, not yet. This is it.

2376
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:18,240
Just a drop of water on the fuel block.

2377
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:20,240
Now that you do it.

2378
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:22,240
Can I start it now?

2379
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:25,240
Not yet. All right.

2380
02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:31,240
Now, start off the engine stinky.

2381
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:34,240
Die, answer.

2382
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:38,240
Did you really turn on the switch? Yes, I did.

2383
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:43,240
The engine won't start. Are you quite sure you turned the one I pointed out to you?

2384
02:24:43,240 --> 02:24:46,240
I think so. Maybe I turned the wrong one.

2385
02:24:46,240 --> 02:24:48,240
There. Outside these two as well.

2386
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:50,240
Come on, stinky. This is no joke.

2387
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:53,240
My reputation as a famous inventor is at stake.

2388
02:24:53,240 --> 02:24:57,240
This should do it, I think. Is that work, Mr. Mapple?

2389
02:24:57,240 --> 02:25:01,240
Nothing is happening. I knew I shouldn't have let you do it better to do it myself.

2390
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:06,240
You're useless. Like Mr. Mapple, I haven't tried the very last one in the row.

2391
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:08,240
This one switched left. What?

2392
02:25:08,240 --> 02:25:12,240
I better throw that one too. You never know. It might just do the trick.

2393
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:24,240
It works. It works. I know it works. I know it works.

2394
02:25:24,240 --> 02:25:26,240
It is working.

2395
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:40,240
I'm not surprised, but I'm so pleased with myself.

2396
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:46,240
You should be here, Snork. This is my great moment. You should be here to share it with me.

2397
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:50,240
Come on, I can't wait to drive this thing.

2398
02:25:53,240 --> 02:25:57,240
Incredible. This ship shall rise like a Phoenix.

2399
02:25:57,240 --> 02:26:01,240
Not the most demanding engine, but this is one of my diesel inventions.

2400
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:12,240
Pass that! Come on! Wait for it!

2401
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:25,240
Come on, let me go! Come on!

2402
02:26:28,240 --> 02:26:32,240
This is your power. I don't think engine has started up.

2403
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:35,240
I'm very much afraid it's exploding.

2404
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:39,240
He's thinking engines exploding.

2405
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:41,240
Where is the back of the ship?

2406
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:45,240
It's going to explode any minute by wonderful invention.

2407
02:27:07,240 --> 02:27:09,240
I don't know.

2408
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:29,240
Now come to your nice room on the small side, but the very best one.

2409
02:27:29,240 --> 02:27:33,240
That explosion. It really was most unexpected, officer.

2410
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:38,240
Everybody knows you're a great inventor. I wonder if you could help me, Mr. Muffle.

2411
02:27:38,240 --> 02:27:39,240
But how?

2412
02:27:39,240 --> 02:27:43,240
Could you think of something to protect my roses while you're staying with us?

2413
02:27:43,240 --> 02:27:45,240
A non-explosive, of course.

2414
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:46,240
Of course I could.

2415
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:48,240
Piece of cake, officer.

2416
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:53,240
Oh, I really did want to fly.

2417
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:58,240
Come, come now. Cheer up, Snork dear.

2418
02:27:58,240 --> 02:28:01,240
Here you are, a nice cup of tea.

2419
02:28:01,240 --> 02:28:02,240
Thanks.

2420
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:08,240
It's very strange, but I had a dream the other night about a flying ship.

2421
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:12,240
Did you really move in? That sounds very interesting.

2422
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:14,240
Yes, very interesting.

2423
02:28:14,240 --> 02:28:16,240
Moment, tell me about it.

2424
02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:21,240
Yes, it was a peculiar looking ship totally different from your flying ship, Snork.

2425
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:23,240
Different? How?

2426
02:28:23,240 --> 02:28:27,240
Well, it was sort of round like this.

2427
02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:31,240
It had a propeller and something hanging underneath.

2428
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:34,240
And we flew over high mountain.

2429
02:28:35,240 --> 02:28:36,240
Round?

2430
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:37,240
Yes.

2431
02:28:37,240 --> 02:28:40,240
And you were in a sort of thing hanging underneath.

2432
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:41,240
Yes.

2433
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:42,240
Round.

2434
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:44,240
Round, huh?

2435
02:28:46,240 --> 02:28:47,240
Round.

2436
02:28:49,240 --> 02:28:51,240
What if it's the matter, Snork?

2437
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:52,240
What?

2438
02:28:52,240 --> 02:28:55,240
Oh, mama, thanks for the tea.

2439
02:28:55,240 --> 02:28:57,240
I think I'm getting a new idea.

2440
02:28:57,240 --> 02:28:59,240
Moment, see you later.

2441
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:01,240
Papa, I must go.

2442
02:29:01,240 --> 02:29:03,240
Oh, fair he goes again.

2443
02:29:03,240 --> 02:29:05,240
I know that, look, mama.

2444
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:09,240
You won't get an intelligent answer out of him for the next month or so, honestly.

2445
02:29:09,240 --> 02:29:11,240
I'm very happy for him.

2446
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:14,240
I must say that was a very clever dream you had, moment.

2447
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:17,240
I'm a better inventor than the mobile.

2448
02:29:17,240 --> 02:29:20,240
You deserve a triangular energy.

2449
02:29:22,240 --> 02:29:26,240
So the explosion didn't distress the Snork for long.

2450
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:31,240
And he was back in his favorite occupation, planning, but planning what?

2451
02:29:31,240 --> 02:29:32,240
Round.

2452
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:41,240
Round.

2453
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:46,240
Round.

2454
02:29:49,240 --> 02:29:55,240
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

2455
02:29:56,240 --> 02:30:03,240
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2456
02:30:03,240 --> 02:30:07,240
They're always happy and goes and played.

2457
02:30:07,240 --> 02:30:10,240
The movements are having fun day after day.

2458
02:30:10,240 --> 02:30:14,240
The movements.

2459
02:30:14,240 --> 02:30:18,240
The movements.

2460
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:23,240
The movements.

2461
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:32,240
The movements.

2462
02:30:32,240 --> 02:30:36,240
The movements.

2463
02:30:36,240 --> 02:30:38,240
The movements.

2464
02:30:38,240 --> 02:30:41,240
The movements.

2465
02:30:41,240 --> 02:30:46,240
The movements.

2466
02:30:46,240 --> 02:30:49,240
The movements.

2467
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:53,240
Here they are for one and all.

2468
02:30:53,240 --> 02:30:56,080
Come on and sit down here with me

2469
02:30:56,080 --> 02:30:58,600
Therefore you aren't your TV

2470
02:30:58,600 --> 02:31:01,480
They are the movements

2471
02:31:01,480 --> 02:31:04,480
They are the movements

2472
02:31:04,480 --> 02:31:07,680
So come with me, give me your hand

2473
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:10,760
I'll take you up to a moment land

2474
02:31:10,760 --> 02:31:13,520
You can fly just like a bird

2475
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:15,960
Sing that song ever

2476
02:31:15,960 --> 02:31:18,880
There were the movements

2477
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:21,800
There were the movements

2478
02:31:21,800 --> 02:31:26,100
There were the movements

2479
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:33,140
There were the movement

2480
02:31:33,140 --> 02:31:57,140
When the henchmen first told Moomin about the golden fish, Moomin thought to himself that it must look something like this.

2481
02:31:57,140 --> 02:32:08,140
My grandpa told me that his mother had actually seen it.

2482
02:32:08,140 --> 02:32:10,140
So you never saw it yourself, Mr. Hamlin?

2483
02:32:10,140 --> 02:32:12,140
No, I'm a botanist.

2484
02:32:12,140 --> 02:32:16,140
It comes to the surface only under very special conditions.

2485
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:18,140
It's very rarely seen.

2486
02:32:18,140 --> 02:32:19,140
Conditions?

2487
02:32:19,140 --> 02:32:20,140
Yes.

2488
02:32:20,140 --> 02:32:23,140
First of all, it must be right between summer and autumn.

2489
02:32:23,140 --> 02:32:25,140
But that's now.

2490
02:32:25,140 --> 02:32:26,140
Yes.

2491
02:32:26,140 --> 02:32:29,140
It has to be in the afternoon sunshine after heavy rain.

2492
02:32:29,140 --> 02:32:31,140
Oh, yes, that does narrow it down.

2493
02:32:31,140 --> 02:32:33,140
And there must be no wind.

2494
02:32:33,140 --> 02:32:36,140
Grandpa said not even a ripple on the water.

2495
02:32:36,140 --> 02:32:37,140
Oh, dear.

2496
02:32:37,140 --> 02:32:42,140
And there are some other conditions that he really didn't know about anyway to see it.

2497
02:32:42,140 --> 02:32:46,140
You must be extremely lucky.

2498
02:32:46,140 --> 02:32:47,140
Hmm.

2499
02:32:47,140 --> 02:32:49,140
Just getting to the lake itself isn't too easy.

2500
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:54,140
It's way beyond lonely mountains.

2501
02:32:54,140 --> 02:32:58,140
Going over lonely mountains and back would take at least two days.

2502
02:32:58,140 --> 02:33:01,140
Not really, because I know a shortcut, Moomin.

2503
02:33:01,140 --> 02:33:03,140
I could take you there and back in one day.

2504
02:33:03,140 --> 02:33:05,140
Oh, could you do that?

2505
02:33:05,140 --> 02:33:06,140
Yes.

2506
02:33:06,140 --> 02:33:08,140
Have you already been there, Snuffkin?

2507
02:33:08,140 --> 02:33:10,140
Just once.

2508
02:33:10,140 --> 02:33:12,140
Oh, will you show me the way?

2509
02:33:12,140 --> 02:33:13,140
You really want to go?

2510
02:33:13,140 --> 02:33:14,140
Yes.

2511
02:33:14,140 --> 02:33:18,140
I must see that golden fish with my own eyes and maybe capture it.

2512
02:33:18,140 --> 02:33:20,140
It won't be easy to capture.

2513
02:33:20,140 --> 02:33:22,140
Why not?

2514
02:33:22,140 --> 02:33:26,140
From what I've heard, the golden fish is far too clever to get caught.

2515
02:33:26,140 --> 02:33:28,140
I know, but it would be so much fun.

2516
02:33:28,140 --> 02:33:29,140
You going alone?

2517
02:33:29,140 --> 02:33:32,140
Well, Snork Maiden said she wanted to come along.

2518
02:33:32,140 --> 02:33:34,140
She gets these ideas, you know.

2519
02:33:34,140 --> 02:33:35,140
Just Snork Maiden?

2520
02:33:35,140 --> 02:33:36,140
Uh, maybe little Mai.

2521
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:38,140
What about Sniff?

2522
02:33:38,140 --> 02:33:40,140
I think he wants to come along too.

2523
02:33:40,140 --> 02:33:42,140
What would you?

2524
02:33:42,140 --> 02:33:45,140
In that case, we'd better go across the mountains.

2525
02:33:45,140 --> 02:33:46,140
Why is that?

2526
02:33:46,140 --> 02:33:48,140
Why can't we take the shortcut?

2527
02:33:48,140 --> 02:33:51,140
The path is rather steep and dangerous, you know, Moomin.

2528
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:54,140
Especially in the forest of witches.

2529
02:33:54,140 --> 02:33:55,140
Hide the witches?

2530
02:33:55,140 --> 02:33:56,140
Not now, maybe.

2531
02:33:56,140 --> 02:33:58,140
Oh, so it's safe then.

2532
02:33:58,140 --> 02:34:02,140
But it's a very deep forest dark and scary even in daytime.

2533
02:34:04,140 --> 02:34:07,140
That's okay, we'll take the shortcut.

2534
02:34:22,140 --> 02:34:26,140
Oh, dear.

2535
02:34:46,140 --> 02:34:48,140
Good morning, Snuffkin.

2536
02:34:52,140 --> 02:34:54,140
Sorry, Snuffkin.

2537
02:34:54,140 --> 02:34:55,140
Guess I overslept.

2538
02:34:55,140 --> 02:34:58,140
Snork Maiden, a little Mai, aren't here yet.

2539
02:34:58,140 --> 02:35:00,140
You're very early.

2540
02:35:00,140 --> 02:35:02,140
Hmm, I dreamt I caught the golden fish,

2541
02:35:02,140 --> 02:35:04,140
and then, of course, I couldn't go back to sleep.

2542
02:35:04,140 --> 02:35:05,140
Well, let's go.

2543
02:35:05,140 --> 02:35:08,140
Shouldn't we wait for Snork Maiden and little Mai?

2544
02:35:08,140 --> 02:35:11,140
Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?

2545
02:35:11,140 --> 02:35:13,140
And anyway, didn't we decide to go back to sleep?

2546
02:35:13,140 --> 02:35:14,140
Well, let's go.

2547
02:35:14,140 --> 02:35:17,140
Shouldn't we wait for Snork Maiden and little Mai?

2548
02:35:17,140 --> 02:35:19,140
Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?

2549
02:35:19,140 --> 02:35:23,140
And anyway, didn't we decide that we wouldn't wait for anybody?

2550
02:35:23,140 --> 02:35:25,140
So it might be better this way.

2551
02:35:25,140 --> 02:35:27,140
What's better this way, woman?

2552
02:35:27,140 --> 02:35:29,140
Oh, little Mai.

2553
02:35:30,140 --> 02:35:31,140
Why don't you stay here?

2554
02:35:31,140 --> 02:35:33,140
This will be a very tough expedition.

2555
02:35:33,140 --> 02:35:35,140
I'm tougher than you.

2556
02:35:35,140 --> 02:35:37,140
Wait for me.

2557
02:35:43,140 --> 02:35:45,140
Hey, walk any faster, Snuffkin.

2558
02:35:45,140 --> 02:35:47,140
I'm still so sleepy.

2559
02:35:49,140 --> 02:35:51,140
Why did we have to leave so early, moving?

2560
02:35:51,140 --> 02:35:54,140
To get there back in a day, Snork Maiden.

2561
02:35:54,140 --> 02:35:56,140
But we aren't taking the shortcut, are we?

2562
02:35:56,140 --> 02:35:59,140
Yes, but it still might get dark before we're back.

2563
02:35:59,140 --> 02:36:01,140
I won't be able to walk back this fast, you know,

2564
02:36:01,140 --> 02:36:04,140
because my bucket will be full of water for the golden fish.

2565
02:36:04,140 --> 02:36:07,140
Well, don't be disappointed if you don't catch it.

2566
02:36:07,140 --> 02:36:09,140
But that's my whole reason for going.

2567
02:36:09,140 --> 02:36:11,140
But you heard what the Himmielin said, Snuff?

2568
02:36:11,140 --> 02:36:15,140
We'll be extremely lucky to even catch sight of the golden fish.

2569
02:36:15,140 --> 02:36:18,140
I heard him, and now's exactly the right time.

2570
02:36:18,140 --> 02:36:20,140
Maybe the others made too much noise.

2571
02:36:20,140 --> 02:36:22,140
We'll just have to wait and see.

2572
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:24,140
Don't you worry, I'll catch him all right.

2573
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:38,140
Where are they going, sorely in the body?

2574
02:36:41,140 --> 02:36:43,140
How far is the forest of witches?

2575
02:36:43,140 --> 02:36:45,140
I'd say about two hours.

2576
02:36:46,140 --> 02:36:51,140
And can you also tell us how long from one end of the forest to the other, Snuffkin?

2577
02:36:51,140 --> 02:36:53,140
About the same.

2578
02:36:55,140 --> 02:36:58,140
Are there really such things as witches?

2579
02:36:58,140 --> 02:36:59,140
No.

2580
02:36:59,140 --> 02:37:01,140
Baby, because I'm not a bit scared of them.

2581
02:37:01,140 --> 02:37:02,140
Aren't you?

2582
02:37:02,140 --> 02:37:03,140
Not the least little bit.

2583
02:37:03,140 --> 02:37:05,140
There used to be some, though.

2584
02:37:05,140 --> 02:37:06,140
Well, of course, Sniff.

2585
02:37:06,140 --> 02:37:10,140
Why else do you think that they call it the forest of witches, huh?

2586
02:37:10,140 --> 02:37:13,140
And you're absolutely sure that there are no witches now.

2587
02:37:14,140 --> 02:37:16,140
I haven't heard of any coming back.

2588
02:37:16,140 --> 02:37:17,140
Mm-hmm.

2589
02:37:17,140 --> 02:37:20,140
So you're not absolutely sure that there are no witches.

2590
02:37:28,140 --> 02:37:30,140
Where's Moominer still in bed?

2591
02:37:30,140 --> 02:37:33,140
He was off before you woke up, Papa.

2592
02:37:33,140 --> 02:37:34,140
Mm-hmm.

2593
02:37:34,140 --> 02:37:37,140
Oh, the golden fish.

2594
02:37:37,140 --> 02:37:39,140
Good morning, dear.

2595
02:37:39,140 --> 02:37:40,140
I wanted to go with him.

2596
02:37:40,140 --> 02:37:43,140
But you're writing your memoirs you're far too busy.

2597
02:37:43,140 --> 02:37:44,140
Mm-hmm.

2598
02:37:44,140 --> 02:37:47,140
That's very true with the sort of a fish that no one has seen.

2599
02:37:47,140 --> 02:37:50,140
That might have been a whole chapter.

2600
02:37:50,140 --> 02:37:52,140
Do you think they'll catch it?

2601
02:37:52,140 --> 02:37:55,140
No, my doubt it very much is highly unlikely.

2602
02:37:55,140 --> 02:37:57,140
In that case, you should have gone with them.

2603
02:37:57,140 --> 02:37:58,140
Mm-hmm.

2604
02:37:58,140 --> 02:38:00,140
I do know a thing or two bad fishing.

2605
02:38:00,140 --> 02:38:03,140
Snuffkin does too, but he's still so young.

2606
02:38:03,140 --> 02:38:04,140
Oh, don't worry.

2607
02:38:04,140 --> 02:38:06,140
I'm sure Snuffkin will manage.

2608
02:38:07,140 --> 02:38:10,140
Oh, this is a spooky forest.

2609
02:38:10,140 --> 02:38:12,140
Maybe the witch is every time.

2610
02:38:12,140 --> 02:38:14,140
Stop it, little lion.

2611
02:38:14,140 --> 02:38:15,140
Listen, everybody.

2612
02:38:15,140 --> 02:38:16,140
Don't stray away from me.

2613
02:38:16,140 --> 02:38:18,140
Promise you might get lost.

2614
02:38:37,140 --> 02:38:38,140
Oh!

2615
02:38:42,140 --> 02:38:44,140
Oh!

2616
02:38:44,140 --> 02:38:46,140
Oh!

2617
02:38:46,140 --> 02:38:49,140
Oh, it's so dark in here.

2618
02:38:49,140 --> 02:38:51,140
Sure isn't so thick.

2619
02:38:51,140 --> 02:38:53,140
The sun can't get through.

2620
02:38:55,140 --> 02:38:57,140
That's because of those clouds.

2621
02:39:00,140 --> 02:39:03,140
I can hear the wind, but we need calm.

2622
02:39:03,140 --> 02:39:06,140
Yep, but we also need heavy rain.

2623
02:39:06,140 --> 02:39:08,140
You're right. That's what the hamulin said.

2624
02:39:08,140 --> 02:39:10,140
It sure looks like rain.

2625
02:39:10,140 --> 02:39:12,140
Not only looks like...

2626
02:39:14,140 --> 02:39:16,140
Oh, it's raining.

2627
02:39:17,140 --> 02:39:18,140
Yeah.

2628
02:39:32,140 --> 02:39:33,140
Here.

2629
02:39:33,140 --> 02:39:34,140
Oh, thank you.

2630
02:39:38,140 --> 02:39:41,140
My god, I saved this rainstorm with very sudden.

2631
02:39:41,140 --> 02:39:43,140
Don't worry. It won't last that long.

2632
02:39:43,140 --> 02:39:44,140
How do you know that?

2633
02:39:44,140 --> 02:39:46,140
Vagabons do.

2634
02:39:46,140 --> 02:39:48,140
This rain isn't that heavy.

2635
02:39:48,140 --> 02:39:50,140
No, it's not bad, but we better hurry.

2636
02:39:50,140 --> 02:39:53,140
We won't get to the lake till noon, and that'll be too late.

2637
02:39:54,140 --> 02:39:57,140
I don't think we'll get very wet down here, Moon.

2638
02:39:57,140 --> 02:39:59,140
So why don't we move on?

2639
02:39:59,140 --> 02:40:00,140
We're so excited.

2640
02:40:00,140 --> 02:40:02,140
What should we do Snuffkin?

2641
02:40:03,140 --> 02:40:05,140
Well, we could move on, couldn't we?

2642
02:40:06,140 --> 02:40:07,140
Yeah.

2643
02:40:13,140 --> 02:40:14,140
Yeah!

2644
02:40:23,140 --> 02:40:25,140
We really aren't getting too wet.

2645
02:40:25,140 --> 02:40:28,140
We better find some shelter quickly.

2646
02:40:28,140 --> 02:40:29,140
About where can we shelter?

2647
02:40:29,140 --> 02:40:31,140
There's nothing in this wood except tree.

2648
02:40:31,140 --> 02:40:33,140
Under a tree, then, I guess.

2649
02:40:34,140 --> 02:40:35,140
Yeah!

2650
02:40:36,140 --> 02:40:38,140
What is it, Snuffkin?

2651
02:40:38,140 --> 02:40:40,140
There's a house over there.

2652
02:40:46,140 --> 02:40:48,140
It's falling to rock and ruin.

2653
02:40:48,140 --> 02:40:51,140
Well, at least it'll keep the rain off.

2654
02:41:04,140 --> 02:41:06,140
Hello there!

2655
02:41:09,140 --> 02:41:11,140
Anyone home?

2656
02:41:12,140 --> 02:41:14,140
There's nobody here.

2657
02:41:24,140 --> 02:41:27,140
No one's lived here for a long time.

2658
02:41:27,140 --> 02:41:31,140
I wonder who could have been lived here all along.

2659
02:41:34,140 --> 02:41:43,140
I know who it was, and so do we all.

2660
02:41:43,140 --> 02:41:45,140
Surely you don't mean.

2661
02:41:45,140 --> 02:41:47,140
The Witches, of course.

2662
02:41:50,140 --> 02:41:57,140
Look around for dried spices, magic herbs, brownie sticks, and a black cat, a niren pot.

2663
02:41:57,140 --> 02:41:58,140
A pile.

2664
02:41:58,140 --> 02:41:59,140
But no, bro!

2665
02:41:59,140 --> 02:42:01,140
No, the Witch rode away on it.

2666
02:42:04,140 --> 02:42:05,140
No!

2667
02:42:06,140 --> 02:42:08,140
There's someone here.

2668
02:42:08,140 --> 02:42:09,140
Who is it?

2669
02:42:16,140 --> 02:42:18,140
Let's get out of here.

2670
02:42:18,140 --> 02:42:20,140
It came from over there.

2671
02:42:26,140 --> 02:42:28,140
No, don't! That's okay, Snuffkin.

2672
02:42:28,140 --> 02:42:30,140
We gotta get out of this place.

2673
02:42:34,140 --> 02:42:35,140
Oh!

2674
02:42:40,140 --> 02:42:42,140
I can't move, Snuffkin.

2675
02:42:42,140 --> 02:42:43,140
Stinky?

2676
02:42:48,140 --> 02:42:49,140
Pretty good.

2677
02:42:49,140 --> 02:42:51,140
I bet you were really scared.

2678
02:42:51,140 --> 02:42:53,140
I wasn't a bit scared, Stinky.

2679
02:42:53,140 --> 02:42:56,140
It's very rude of sniff to faint when he hears my voice.

2680
02:42:56,140 --> 02:42:58,140
Where are you after anyway?

2681
02:42:59,140 --> 02:43:03,140
Oh, come on, tell me.

2682
02:43:03,140 --> 02:43:05,140
Can't you even take a joke?

2683
02:43:05,140 --> 02:43:07,140
Come on, wait for me.

2684
02:43:21,140 --> 02:43:22,140
That way.

2685
02:43:22,140 --> 02:43:23,140
Okay.

2686
02:43:25,140 --> 02:43:26,140
Come on.

2687
02:43:28,140 --> 02:43:30,140
Come on.

2688
02:43:59,140 --> 02:44:00,140
This is it, isn't it?

2689
02:44:00,140 --> 02:44:01,140
Yes it is.

2690
02:44:01,140 --> 02:44:02,140
Where's the golden fish?

2691
02:44:02,140 --> 02:44:03,140
I really don't know.

2692
02:44:03,140 --> 02:44:05,140
I've never seen it either.

2693
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:08,140
With rain, sunshine, and calm, I'm sure the fish will come.

2694
02:44:08,140 --> 02:44:10,140
The golden fish?

2695
02:44:10,140 --> 02:44:11,140
Help me catch it.

2696
02:44:11,140 --> 02:44:13,140
I just gotta have that golden fish.

2697
02:44:22,140 --> 02:44:23,140
No!

2698
02:44:29,140 --> 02:44:31,140
It's deep down in here somewhere.

2699
02:44:40,140 --> 02:44:42,140
I can't see any fish anywhere.

2700
02:44:42,140 --> 02:44:46,140
Maybe it was Hemiellin's idea of a very funny joke.

2701
02:44:46,140 --> 02:44:49,140
The Hemiellin doesn't joke.

2702
02:44:49,140 --> 02:44:51,140
Let's sit down and wait.

2703
02:44:51,140 --> 02:44:53,140
I'm sure the golden fish will appear for us.

2704
02:44:53,140 --> 02:44:55,140
I don't believe it.

2705
02:44:55,140 --> 02:44:59,140
I mean to say you came all this way here just to see some stupid old fish.

2706
02:44:59,140 --> 02:45:00,140
I came to catch it.

2707
02:45:00,140 --> 02:45:02,140
Well, that's even more stupid.

2708
02:45:02,140 --> 02:45:04,140
Hey, stop making those ripples.

2709
02:45:08,140 --> 02:45:12,140
So they really got excited and walked all the way, you say?

2710
02:45:12,140 --> 02:45:14,140
Oh, to be young again.

2711
02:45:14,140 --> 02:45:17,140
Well, I would have gone with them if I hadn't over slept.

2712
02:45:17,140 --> 02:45:21,140
I didn't know that you were that young woman, Papa.

2713
02:45:21,140 --> 02:45:23,140
I'm not exactly old, you know.

2714
02:45:23,140 --> 02:45:27,140
Pretty interesting to see a fish that hardly anyone's ever seen.

2715
02:45:27,140 --> 02:45:32,140
Sniff said that he would catch this golden fish if it's the last thing he did.

2716
02:45:32,140 --> 02:45:33,140
Oh, how?

2717
02:45:33,140 --> 02:45:38,140
Well, he had a net and a very large bucket to carry at home, then.

2718
02:45:38,140 --> 02:45:41,140
That's a good one.

2719
02:45:41,140 --> 02:45:43,140
What do you mean?

2720
02:45:43,140 --> 02:45:46,140
I guess I must have forgotten to tell you all the details.

2721
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:49,140
There's so much you don't know about this fish.

2722
02:45:54,140 --> 02:45:56,140
Hmm.

2723
02:45:56,140 --> 02:45:58,140
Can't see it from up here.

2724
02:45:58,140 --> 02:45:59,140
Hmm.

2725
02:45:59,140 --> 02:46:02,140
Oh, the hamulan was certainly right.

2726
02:46:02,140 --> 02:46:06,140
Hardly anyone has seen this golden fish and we're not going to see it either.

2727
02:46:06,140 --> 02:46:08,140
Maybe somebody ate him years ago.

2728
02:46:08,140 --> 02:46:11,140
Stinky, be quiet, please.

2729
02:46:13,140 --> 02:46:14,140
Did you see it?

2730
02:46:14,140 --> 02:46:16,140
Where did you see it?

2731
02:46:18,140 --> 02:46:22,140
I saw a fish jump, but I couldn't tell if it was golden.

2732
02:46:22,140 --> 02:46:24,140
It was much too far away.

2733
02:46:24,140 --> 02:46:27,140
With the sun over there, we just see the outlines, Nork Maiden.

2734
02:46:27,140 --> 02:46:29,140
Yes, we couldn't really see the color.

2735
02:46:29,140 --> 02:46:31,140
Look, everybody, look.

2736
02:46:31,140 --> 02:46:34,140
I can see a raft over there.

2737
02:46:34,140 --> 02:46:37,140
Hey, let's take it and go out to the middle of the lake.

2738
02:46:37,140 --> 02:46:40,140
But it's much too small for all of us.

2739
02:46:40,140 --> 02:46:43,140
Don't worry, Sniff, this won't sink.

2740
02:46:46,140 --> 02:46:47,140
I'm staying.

2741
02:46:47,140 --> 02:46:51,140
You do what you like, but you'll never catch any fish if you're afraid of water.

2742
02:46:52,140 --> 02:46:54,140
Hmm.

2743
02:46:54,140 --> 02:46:56,140
Stinky, you can help me.

2744
02:46:56,140 --> 02:46:57,140
It's gold, you know.

2745
02:46:57,140 --> 02:47:01,140
We can sell it for a lot of money and then we'll both be very wealthy.

2746
02:47:12,140 --> 02:47:15,140
I think it was somewhere around here, wasn't it?

2747
02:47:15,140 --> 02:47:18,140
Or, unless I suppose, hard to say.

2748
02:47:18,140 --> 02:47:20,140
Well, I can't see anything.

2749
02:47:21,140 --> 02:47:22,140
I can't see.

2750
02:47:22,140 --> 02:47:25,140
There's certainly no sign of it now.

2751
02:47:25,140 --> 02:47:29,140
Well, we'll just have to sit and wait here.

2752
02:47:29,140 --> 02:47:31,140
We have no choice.

2753
02:47:31,140 --> 02:47:33,140
And I'm not going home until I've seen it.

2754
02:47:33,140 --> 02:47:35,140
I'm happy to wait all day.

2755
02:47:35,140 --> 02:47:38,140
You won't find it by looking up at the sky.

2756
02:47:38,140 --> 02:47:39,140
You know what?

2757
02:47:39,140 --> 02:47:43,140
Fish like it in places where there are lots of weeds.

2758
02:47:43,140 --> 02:47:45,140
Oh, the raft's in the middle of the lake.

2759
02:47:45,140 --> 02:47:48,140
And they just want to see the fish, but you wait.

2760
02:47:48,140 --> 02:47:50,140
I'm going to catch it.

2761
02:47:50,140 --> 02:47:54,140
Maybe somebody's already caught it and you can get it in the tin.

2762
02:47:59,140 --> 02:48:00,140
What did you see?

2763
02:48:00,140 --> 02:48:03,140
Over there, something shiny jumping.

2764
02:48:03,140 --> 02:48:04,140
What did you see?

2765
02:48:04,140 --> 02:48:05,140
That's all you.

2766
02:48:05,140 --> 02:48:06,140
Now keep quiet.

2767
02:48:19,140 --> 02:48:21,140
I hate fishing.

2768
02:48:21,140 --> 02:48:27,140
Guess we better think about getting back otherwise we'll never get home before nightfall.

2769
02:48:27,140 --> 02:48:31,140
I don't want to get lost on a raft in the dark on this lonely lake.

2770
02:48:31,140 --> 02:48:34,140
Perhaps we were expecting too much.

2771
02:48:34,140 --> 02:48:38,140
Maybe your right's not made in, but I really thought we'd see it.

2772
02:48:38,140 --> 02:48:41,140
This is the most disappointing day of my life.

2773
02:48:41,140 --> 02:48:43,140
We can come back.

2774
02:48:43,140 --> 02:48:44,140
Yes.

2775
02:48:49,140 --> 02:48:51,140
It's not going to stop.

2776
02:49:03,140 --> 02:49:04,140
Hang on.

2777
02:49:04,140 --> 02:49:06,140
Did you see a moment?

2778
02:49:06,140 --> 02:49:07,140
Shh.

2779
02:49:19,140 --> 02:49:20,140
Oh.

2780
02:49:27,140 --> 02:49:29,140
It's gigantic.

2781
02:49:49,140 --> 02:49:50,140
Oh.

2782
02:49:50,140 --> 02:49:51,140
Oh.

2783
02:49:51,140 --> 02:49:52,140
Oh.

2784
02:49:52,140 --> 02:49:53,140
Oh.

2785
02:49:53,140 --> 02:49:54,140
Oh.

2786
02:49:54,140 --> 02:49:55,140
Oh.

2787
02:49:57,140 --> 02:49:58,140
Oh.

2788
02:49:58,140 --> 02:49:59,140
Oh.

2789
02:49:59,140 --> 02:50:00,140
Oh.

2790
02:50:00,140 --> 02:50:01,140
Oh.

2791
02:50:01,140 --> 02:50:02,140
Oh.

2792
02:50:02,140 --> 02:50:03,140
Oh.

2793
02:50:03,140 --> 02:50:04,140
Oh.

2794
02:50:04,140 --> 02:50:05,140
Oh.

2795
02:50:05,140 --> 02:50:06,140
Oh.

2796
02:50:06,140 --> 02:50:07,140
Oh.

2797
02:50:07,140 --> 02:50:08,140
Oh.

2798
02:50:08,140 --> 02:50:09,140
Oh.

2799
02:50:09,140 --> 02:50:10,140
Oh.

2800
02:50:10,140 --> 02:50:11,140
Oh.

2801
02:50:11,140 --> 02:50:12,140
Oh.

2802
02:50:12,140 --> 02:50:13,140
Oh.

2803
02:50:13,140 --> 02:50:14,140
Oh.

2804
02:50:14,140 --> 02:50:15,140
Oh.

2805
02:50:15,140 --> 02:50:16,140
Oh.

2806
02:50:16,140 --> 02:50:17,140
Oh.

2807
02:50:18,140 --> 02:50:19,140
We've seen.

2808
02:50:19,140 --> 02:50:20,140
We have.

2809
02:50:20,140 --> 02:50:21,140
Oh.

2810
02:50:21,140 --> 02:50:22,140
That was right.

2811
02:50:22,140 --> 02:50:23,140
I really saw it.

2812
02:50:23,140 --> 02:50:24,140
I saw it.

2813
02:50:24,140 --> 02:50:26,140
First it was I believe about it.

2814
02:50:26,140 --> 02:50:27,140
Oh.

2815
02:50:27,140 --> 02:50:28,140
Oh.

2816
02:50:28,140 --> 02:50:29,140
Oh.

2817
02:50:31,140 --> 02:50:34,140
Oh.

2818
02:50:40,140 --> 02:50:41,140
Yachty.

2819
02:50:41,140 --> 02:50:42,140
I love you.

2820
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:43,140
Yachty.

2821
02:50:43,140 --> 02:50:44,140
I love you.

2822
02:50:44,140 --> 02:50:45,140
I love you.

2823
02:50:45,140 --> 02:50:46,140
I love you.

2824
02:50:46,140 --> 02:50:47,140
I love you.

2825
02:50:47,140 --> 02:50:48,140
I love you.

2826
02:50:48,140 --> 02:50:49,140
I love you.

2827
02:50:49,140 --> 02:50:50,140
I love you.

2828
02:50:50,140 --> 02:50:51,140
I love you.

2829
02:50:51,140 --> 02:50:52,140
I love you.

2830
02:50:52,140 --> 02:50:53,140
I love you.

2831
02:50:53,140 --> 02:50:54,140
I love you.

2832
02:50:54,140 --> 02:50:55,140
I love you.

2833
02:50:55,140 --> 02:50:56,140
I love you.

2834
02:50:56,140 --> 02:50:57,140
I love you.

2835
02:50:57,140 --> 02:50:58,140
I love you.

2836
02:50:58,140 --> 02:50:59,140
I love you.

2837
02:50:59,140 --> 02:51:00,140
I love you.

2838
02:51:00,140 --> 02:51:01,140
I love you.

2839
02:51:01,140 --> 02:51:02,140
I love you.

2840
02:51:02,140 --> 02:51:03,140
I love you.

2841
02:51:03,140 --> 02:51:04,140
I love you.

2842
02:51:04,140 --> 02:51:05,140
I love you.

2843
02:51:05,140 --> 02:51:06,140
I love you.

2844
02:51:06,140 --> 02:51:07,140
I love you.

2845
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:08,140
I love you.

2846
02:51:08,140 --> 02:51:09,140
I love you.

2847
02:51:09,140 --> 02:51:10,140
I love you.

2848
02:51:10,140 --> 02:51:11,140
I love you.

2849
02:51:11,140 --> 02:51:12,140
I love you.

2850
02:51:12,140 --> 02:51:13,140
I love you.

2851
02:51:13,140 --> 02:51:14,140
I love you.

2852
02:51:14,140 --> 02:51:15,140
I love you.

2853
02:51:15,140 --> 02:51:16,140
I love you.

2854
02:51:16,140 --> 02:51:17,140
I love you.

2855
02:51:17,140 --> 02:51:18,140
I love you.

2856
02:51:18,140 --> 02:51:19,140
I love you.

2857
02:51:19,140 --> 02:51:20,140
I love you.

2858
02:51:20,140 --> 02:51:21,140
I love you.

2859
02:51:21,140 --> 02:51:22,140
I love you.

2860
02:51:22,140 --> 02:51:23,140
I love you.

2861
02:51:23,140 --> 02:51:24,140
I love you.

2862
02:51:24,140 --> 02:51:25,140
I love you.

2863
02:51:25,140 --> 02:51:26,140
I love you.

2864
02:51:26,140 --> 02:51:27,140
How much do you want the old sponge cake cookies?

2865
02:51:27,140 --> 02:51:28,140
I love it.

2866
02:51:28,140 --> 02:51:29,140
Wow.

2867
02:51:29,140 --> 02:51:30,140
I love it.

2868
02:51:30,140 --> 02:51:31,140
I love it.

2869
02:51:31,140 --> 02:51:32,140
I love it.

2870
02:51:32,140 --> 02:51:33,140
I love it.

2871
02:51:33,140 --> 02:51:34,140
I think it was cool.

2872
02:51:34,140 --> 02:51:35,140
I love it.

2873
02:51:35,140 --> 02:51:36,140
I think it was cool.

2874
02:51:36,140 --> 02:51:37,140
I love it.

2875
02:51:37,140 --> 02:51:38,140
I love it.

2876
02:51:38,140 --> 02:51:39,140
Well, I envy it.

2877
02:51:39,140 --> 02:51:40,140
It's cool.

2878
02:51:40,140 --> 02:51:41,140
I envy it.

2879
02:51:41,140 --> 02:51:42,140
Well, I envy it.

2880
02:51:42,140 --> 02:51:56,500
Steth and Stinky never really got over their belief that it was actually the golden fish

2881
02:51:56,500 --> 02:51:58,000
they had caught.

2882
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:03,420
But moving in the others were in no doubt about what they had seen, the aim of the emilence

2883
02:52:03,420 --> 02:52:10,420
they were in no doubt about what they had seen, the aim of the emilence, they were in no

2884
02:52:10,420 --> 02:52:18,420
doubt about what they had seen, the aim of the emilence, they were in no doubt about

2885
02:52:18,420 --> 02:52:25,420
what they had seen, the aim of the emilence, they were in no doubt about what they had seen,

2886
02:52:25,420 --> 02:52:32,420
the aim of the emilence, they were in no doubt about what they had seen, the aim of the

2887
02:52:32,420 --> 02:52:39,420
emilence, the movements, the movements.

2888
02:53:02,420 --> 02:53:13,420
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here

2889
02:53:13,420 --> 02:53:22,420
with me, they here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

2890
02:53:22,420 --> 02:53:30,420
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land, you can fly

2891
02:53:30,420 --> 02:53:37,420
just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

2892
02:53:37,420 --> 02:53:48,420
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

2893
02:53:48,420 --> 02:54:00,420
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

2894
02:54:00,420 --> 02:54:05,420
Snoke made him was in a very good mood because that day she was off to collect shells

2895
02:54:05,420 --> 02:54:15,420
of the sea shore with me, movement.

2896
02:54:15,420 --> 02:54:20,420
Hey, look, the sun's up, and there's Gracie.

2897
02:54:25,420 --> 02:54:27,420
Oh, rat.

2898
02:54:27,420 --> 02:54:29,420
What's the matter, Papa?

2899
02:54:29,420 --> 02:54:31,420
Oh, it's your moment.

2900
02:54:31,420 --> 02:54:33,420
What are you doing?

2901
02:54:33,420 --> 02:54:35,420
I heard you talking to yourself just now.

2902
02:54:35,420 --> 02:54:37,420
Huh? Oh.

2903
02:54:39,420 --> 02:54:42,420
You see this? I'm writing a play.

2904
02:54:42,420 --> 02:54:43,420
Writing a play?

2905
02:54:43,420 --> 02:54:45,420
You remember the last children?

2906
02:54:45,420 --> 02:54:49,420
That was a very successful play, and just now I was repeating a line.

2907
02:54:49,420 --> 02:54:53,420
Hey, look, another beautiful day, and there goes Gracie.

2908
02:54:53,420 --> 02:54:55,420
It's a wonderful line, of course.

2909
02:54:55,420 --> 02:54:57,420
Don't you agree?

2910
02:54:57,420 --> 02:54:59,420
It could be improved.

2911
02:54:59,420 --> 02:55:01,420
I think about it.

2912
02:55:14,420 --> 02:55:16,420
Moment, moment, look at this.

2913
02:55:16,420 --> 02:55:18,420
Beautiful.

2914
02:55:21,420 --> 02:55:22,420
You find anything?

2915
02:55:22,420 --> 02:55:24,420
No, just usual old stuff.

2916
02:55:31,420 --> 02:55:33,420
Oh, there's another big one.

2917
02:55:33,420 --> 02:55:35,420
Can't you really find anything, moment?

2918
02:55:38,420 --> 02:55:40,420
I'll look somewhere else.

2919
02:55:40,420 --> 02:55:42,420
I still think this is the best place.

2920
02:55:42,420 --> 02:55:44,420
Well, I'm going off of there.

2921
02:55:46,420 --> 02:55:48,420
You're so beautiful.

2922
02:55:50,420 --> 02:55:52,420
Oh.

2923
02:55:54,420 --> 02:55:56,420
What are you doing, moment?

2924
02:55:56,420 --> 02:55:58,420
No, that's no shell surely.

2925
02:55:58,420 --> 02:55:59,420
No.

2926
02:55:59,420 --> 02:56:01,420
So why did you dig it out?

2927
02:56:01,420 --> 02:56:04,420
Well, once you see it, you want to find out what it is.

2928
02:56:06,420 --> 02:56:08,420
A very odd thing, isn't it?

2929
02:56:08,420 --> 02:56:10,420
Not very interesting.

2930
02:56:13,420 --> 02:56:16,420
Oh, no, I can see what it is.

2931
02:56:16,420 --> 02:56:18,420
I gave it a good wash.

2932
02:56:18,420 --> 02:56:20,420
I've seen one just like it in the fairy tales.

2933
02:56:20,420 --> 02:56:22,420
It's an old lamb.

2934
02:56:22,420 --> 02:56:24,420
Yes, you remember the story called him added?

2935
02:56:24,420 --> 02:56:26,420
He rubbed the lamb and the genie appeared.

2936
02:56:26,420 --> 02:56:30,420
The genie might appear for us if we do what Aladdin did.

2937
02:56:30,420 --> 02:56:33,420
Don't be silly, Snork Maiden.

2938
02:56:36,420 --> 02:56:40,420
But Snork Maiden, that was a fairy tale.

2939
02:56:40,420 --> 02:56:43,420
Don't laugh. I just want to make absolutely sure.

2940
02:56:43,420 --> 02:56:46,420
To tell you the truth, I've already tried it.

2941
02:56:46,420 --> 02:56:49,420
My hands turned green. That's all that happened to me.

2942
02:56:49,420 --> 02:56:51,420
Maybe you didn't do it the right way.

2943
02:56:51,420 --> 02:56:53,420
You can't even whip cream properly.

2944
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:57,420
And I'm sure you have to say some magic words such as

2945
02:56:57,420 --> 02:57:00,420
apricot dapura, spirit, come forth.

2946
02:57:00,420 --> 02:57:03,420
Apricot dapura, try for all your words.

2947
02:57:03,420 --> 02:57:05,420
You've chosen the wrong words.

2948
02:57:05,420 --> 02:57:08,420
You should say, come out, say something or something.

2949
02:57:09,420 --> 02:57:12,420
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.

2950
02:57:12,420 --> 02:57:14,420
Keep going, Snork Maiden.

2951
02:57:26,420 --> 02:57:28,420
I am the spirit of the land.

2952
02:57:28,420 --> 02:57:30,420
What is your command?

2953
02:57:33,420 --> 02:57:36,420
Goodness, did you come out of this lamp?

2954
02:57:36,420 --> 02:57:37,420
You got it.

2955
02:57:37,420 --> 02:57:40,420
So you really are the spirit of this lamp?

2956
02:57:40,420 --> 02:57:41,420
Always have been.

2957
02:57:41,420 --> 02:57:44,420
But I have the book and you're not him.

2958
02:57:44,420 --> 02:57:48,420
I can prove it if you're quite sure you want me to.

2959
02:57:48,420 --> 02:57:51,420
By all means, it probably wasn't a good picture.

2960
02:57:51,420 --> 02:57:54,420
I'm the one and only spirit of the lamp.

2961
02:57:54,420 --> 02:57:59,420
Then you must have the power to make any wish come true, is that so?

2962
02:57:59,420 --> 02:58:01,420
Are we certainly but not yours?

2963
02:58:01,420 --> 02:58:03,420
But I'm the one who dug you out.

2964
02:58:03,420 --> 02:58:05,420
That's not so important, kid.

2965
02:58:05,420 --> 02:58:08,420
She's the one who summoned me forth from the lamp.

2966
02:58:08,420 --> 02:58:10,420
What are we going to do about this spirit?

2967
02:58:10,420 --> 02:58:12,420
Why, ask for something.

2968
02:58:12,420 --> 02:58:14,420
Ask for something you've always wanted.

2969
02:58:14,420 --> 02:58:16,420
Uh, let's see.

2970
02:58:16,420 --> 02:58:17,420
A pearl necklace.

2971
02:58:17,420 --> 02:58:20,420
So it may your wishes, my command.

2972
02:58:21,420 --> 02:58:23,420
Hey, wait a minute.

2973
02:58:23,420 --> 02:58:27,420
Oh, a pearl necklace is only one of the things I wanted.

2974
02:58:27,420 --> 02:58:28,420
I hadn't decided yet.

2975
02:58:28,420 --> 02:58:30,420
Don't worry, Snork Maiden.

2976
02:58:30,420 --> 02:58:32,420
I guess you can always send it back.

2977
02:58:32,420 --> 02:58:35,420
If I like the necklace, then it's your turn to rub the lamp.

2978
02:58:35,420 --> 02:58:38,420
Then you can wish for whatever you've always wanted.

2979
02:58:38,420 --> 02:58:39,420
Yes.

2980
02:58:39,420 --> 02:58:42,420
But where exactly did you rub the lamp?

2981
02:58:42,420 --> 02:58:44,420
Right here, and very, very slowly.

2982
02:58:44,420 --> 02:58:45,420
All right.

2983
02:58:45,420 --> 02:58:47,420
I'll say spirit come forth.

2984
02:58:47,420 --> 02:58:50,420
It sounds a little better than come out, spirit.

2985
02:58:50,420 --> 02:58:59,420
Oh, that was loud.

2986
02:58:59,420 --> 02:59:05,420
Oh, he's back.

2987
02:59:05,420 --> 02:59:07,420
One oil necklace, Miss.

2988
02:59:07,420 --> 02:59:08,420
Thanks.

2989
02:59:08,420 --> 02:59:10,420
This is incredible.

2990
02:59:10,420 --> 02:59:11,420
Right.

2991
02:59:11,420 --> 02:59:14,420
I do think this is exactly what I wanted.

2992
02:59:14,420 --> 02:59:16,420
Oh, thank you ever so much.

2993
02:59:16,420 --> 02:59:18,420
All in a day's wake.

2994
02:59:18,420 --> 02:59:22,420
So pleased to oblige, Miss.

2995
02:59:22,420 --> 02:59:24,420
Are you going back into the lamp?

2996
02:59:24,420 --> 02:59:25,420
Yes, I am.

2997
02:59:25,420 --> 02:59:26,420
I'm so happy.

2998
02:59:26,420 --> 02:59:29,420
Now, it's my turn to let you out of here.

2999
02:59:29,420 --> 02:59:32,420
I'd like to have a wish granted, too, please.

3000
02:59:32,420 --> 02:59:33,420
Now, wait a minute.

3001
02:59:33,420 --> 02:59:38,420
If getting in and out is a bother, why don't you let me give you my wish right now?

3002
02:59:38,420 --> 02:59:40,420
Can't do it, young man.

3003
02:59:40,420 --> 02:59:42,420
One at a time in the face to call.

3004
02:59:42,420 --> 02:59:44,420
Just wanted to save time.

3005
02:59:44,420 --> 02:59:45,420
Impossible, young say.

3006
02:59:45,420 --> 02:59:46,420
But why?

3007
02:59:46,420 --> 02:59:50,420
Because I am only able to fulfill one wish a week.

3008
02:59:50,420 --> 02:59:51,420
I need my rest.

3009
02:59:51,420 --> 02:59:53,420
It's hard working, though.

3010
02:59:53,420 --> 02:59:55,420
Oh, well, of course it's tiring.

3011
02:59:55,420 --> 02:59:57,420
Perhaps I expected too much from you.

3012
02:59:57,420 --> 02:59:58,420
Hold on.

3013
02:59:58,420 --> 03:00:01,420
I wouldn't like you to think that I haven't got the power.

3014
03:00:01,420 --> 03:00:03,420
I can do many extraordinary things.

3015
03:00:03,420 --> 03:00:04,420
What kind of things?

3016
03:00:04,420 --> 03:00:05,420
Not telling you.

3017
03:00:12,420 --> 03:00:13,420
Listen, moment.

3018
03:00:13,420 --> 03:00:15,420
We won't tell a soul about this lamp, all right?

3019
03:00:15,420 --> 03:00:16,420
Of course not.

3020
03:00:24,420 --> 03:00:25,420
No.

3021
03:00:38,420 --> 03:00:40,420
No, names don't really matter.

3022
03:00:40,420 --> 03:00:44,420
Tulip, hydranger, who cares?

3023
03:00:44,420 --> 03:00:46,420
No, that's not right somehow.

3024
03:00:46,420 --> 03:00:48,420
I'm a geranium of ox glove.

3025
03:00:48,420 --> 03:00:50,420
Oh, I'm so tired.

3026
03:00:53,420 --> 03:00:56,040
H.L.D View

3027
03:01:16,560 --> 03:01:17,800
Hmm.

3028
03:01:19,300 --> 03:01:22,280
Praise the lad and I didn't tell them I can get out at night.

3029
03:01:22,280 --> 03:01:26,520
I'd have no peace at all. My leisure time would be totally ruined by these two

3030
03:01:27,400 --> 03:01:33,260
Good thing also I can read their minds, so I know what I'm up against. They're up to something I know they are

3031
03:01:44,780 --> 03:01:49,760
Oh, yes, dear me dear me no one did the young man is worried to death

3032
03:01:50,760 --> 03:01:53,440
She wish I better rewrite this. Oh

3033
03:01:54,760 --> 03:01:57,920
Edgur Edgur, I do wish you was somebody else

3034
03:01:58,600 --> 03:02:02,840
This will certainly have to be changed the whole page really

3035
03:02:02,840 --> 03:02:25,520
What's going on here? Who did this? Mom, not you surely what some

3036
03:02:25,520 --> 03:02:32,000
Rascals been rewriting my play. Who could that possibly be who indeed in the middle of the night while I was asleep

3037
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:41,080
It's very strange, isn't it Papa? It can't be you moment, can't it? Of course not Papa. I am upset. Who can it be?

3038
03:02:41,840 --> 03:02:46,280
Imagine going into your study while you were fast asleep. It's very rude, isn't it?

3039
03:02:46,280 --> 03:02:49,360
I find it incredible that anyone could do such a thing

3040
03:02:49,880 --> 03:02:54,040
And all the rewriting was done on those bits that I knew weren't perfectly polished

3041
03:02:54,600 --> 03:02:57,880
Listen dear. I'm sure they were far too good for him to improve on

3042
03:02:58,600 --> 03:03:04,040
No, no, you're wrong. That's the worst thing. I must admit he did improve them

3043
03:03:04,240 --> 03:03:06,560
Then I think you should feel pleased dear

3044
03:03:07,080 --> 03:03:12,120
Yeah, no, I'm not a bit pleased and parameter should write his own plays

3045
03:03:12,800 --> 03:03:16,680
Looks great snorkemaiden that is if you like necklaces

3046
03:03:16,920 --> 03:03:19,560
Thank you little my it was given to me as a present

3047
03:03:20,320 --> 03:03:25,440
Rather nice would you mind if I tried it on for a minute? Of course not. I'm sure you'll look gorgeous

3048
03:03:26,440 --> 03:03:32,320
I suppose in time one could get to like necklaces. I could ask for similar one for you

3049
03:03:33,720 --> 03:03:35,720
Deepers who's your rich friend

3050
03:03:36,440 --> 03:03:40,840
Yes, I search the whole house, but I can't find it anywhere

3051
03:03:41,320 --> 03:03:47,480
Someone must have stolen it. Don't worry Mrs. Philly-Johnk. I fully expect to arrest the thief any minute now

3052
03:03:47,680 --> 03:03:55,320
Good afternoon inspector. Hello, snorkemaiden. Please hurry inspector. The thief is almost certainly let movement valley already

3053
03:03:55,440 --> 03:04:01,000
Oh dear. Oh dear. Nothing is safe in this valley anymore. Now calm down Mrs. Philly-Johnk

3054
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:05,600
Did you just say you've had something stolen Mrs. Philly-Johnk my pearl necklace?

3055
03:04:06,080 --> 03:04:11,440
Extraordinarily beautiful pearls eighty-seven of them looks just like the one you're wearing little my

3056
03:04:12,200 --> 03:04:14,200
You stole it

3057
03:04:15,640 --> 03:04:17,640
Did you

3058
03:04:17,640 --> 03:04:19,640
Oh

3059
03:04:19,640 --> 03:04:21,640
What are you doing?

3060
03:04:24,640 --> 03:04:26,640
She's innocent

3061
03:04:32,640 --> 03:04:34,640
Snorkemaiden's necklace

3062
03:04:37,640 --> 03:04:42,480
The best explanation you can think of no one calls little my a thief and gets away with it

3063
03:04:42,840 --> 03:04:50,360
Is it really true that this is your necklace snorkemaiden? Of course inspector. It was a present. I swear it who gave it to you

3064
03:04:50,360 --> 03:04:53,760
That's a secret between me and movement a secret

3065
03:04:54,200 --> 03:04:59,720
That's a lie. They stole it inspector. I've never known them to lie before Mrs. Philly-Johnk

3066
03:04:59,720 --> 03:05:02,360
From a very bad background you should see their home

3067
03:05:02,360 --> 03:05:04,360
So

3068
03:05:09,960 --> 03:05:11,960
Something I want to ask you

3069
03:05:32,480 --> 03:05:34,480
I love to know

3070
03:05:38,480 --> 03:05:40,480
Listen to this. This is a good example

3071
03:05:41,120 --> 03:05:44,600
Hey look at the sky the sun's up and there's Gracie

3072
03:05:45,320 --> 03:05:47,320
That's not great sounds very ordinary

3073
03:05:48,320 --> 03:05:51,480
That's what I wrote snuffkin. Oh, I'm so sorry

3074
03:05:52,160 --> 03:05:55,200
That's all right now listen to how he rewrote it

3075
03:05:55,720 --> 03:06:02,720
But soft what light through yonder window breaks it is the east and juliet is the sun a rise

3076
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:08,120
Verson and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief

3077
03:06:09,120 --> 03:06:14,840
What a sunrise and not how clever this writer is to change a name from Gracie to juliet

3078
03:06:16,200 --> 03:06:19,440
Gracie's worried because appearance don't approve of her love Edgar

3079
03:06:19,440 --> 03:06:25,080
I had his names don't matter tulip. I'd rangers who cares but listen to this

3080
03:06:25,560 --> 03:06:32,840
What's in a name that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet much more romantic

3081
03:06:35,400 --> 03:06:40,440
Not a Romeo called oh, it's simply great except maybe I wouldn't have mentioned his smell

3082
03:06:40,880 --> 03:06:43,160
Don't you agree is an excellent playwright?

3083
03:06:44,640 --> 03:06:51,640
Yes, I agree he sounds like a very promising playwright and then wordy perhaps but really good very good indeed

3084
03:06:52,440 --> 03:06:56,800
Write him a note asking him to carry on and there might not be necessary

3085
03:06:56,800 --> 03:07:04,840
You know all the changes were made in the middle of the night while I was fast asleep and usually writers are in their beds none of their desks when they're asleep

3086
03:07:06,600 --> 03:07:11,440
Well, yes, that's the only time you're not at your desk isn't it but there are people

3087
03:07:11,440 --> 03:07:16,720
You know who walk about at night without remembering about it the next morning sleepwalkers

3088
03:07:16,720 --> 03:07:21,480
You mean now I come to think of it you were rather sleepy when you woke up this morning

3089
03:07:21,640 --> 03:07:30,760
You're right mum and mama even sleepier than usual just so you mean you yourself got up at night and then went and rewrote the play and you're sleep

3090
03:07:31,360 --> 03:07:36,160
Well, yes, I have been worried about some minor things in my play

3091
03:07:36,720 --> 03:07:41,480
So my subconsciousness fairly rich in literary talent as we all know

3092
03:07:41,720 --> 03:07:47,000
Comes to the rescue a moment papa and in my sleep my imagination runs riot

3093
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:54,840
I have all sorts of good ideas that make me grab a pen in the middle of the night and rush to my room to let the real skill through

3094
03:07:57,360 --> 03:07:59,360
Got it

3095
03:07:59,360 --> 03:08:03,800
I got it with this I can have anything I can do anything

3096
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:32,360
I know why you're running you stole that thing in you I know it's true

3097
03:08:36,200 --> 03:08:38,200
But it must be somebody so

3098
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
Like

3099
03:09:00,840 --> 03:09:02,840
Like

3100
03:09:02,840 --> 03:09:04,840
Did you hear that enough here?

3101
03:09:05,160 --> 03:09:07,160
You said magic lamp or something

3102
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:46,280
You're the spirit of the lamp aren't you? Yes, my master. What is your wish? You his master? Yes, me

3103
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:53,880
I'm the master I let him out so he'll do what I say I don't believe a word of this fairy tales on true

3104
03:09:54,520 --> 03:10:01,000
Maybe it isn't true, but it works. I saw snork maiden wishing for a pearl necklace and her wish was granted

3105
03:10:01,640 --> 03:10:06,200
Uh-huh, so you're responsible. Yeah, and I brought it right away

3106
03:10:06,840 --> 03:10:08,840
God now let me see

3107
03:10:09,080 --> 03:10:11,320
What do I want more than anything in the world?

3108
03:10:11,640 --> 03:10:16,040
Stinky he can only make one wish a week come true. You'll have to wait your turn

3109
03:10:16,520 --> 03:10:18,520
No, that's very unfair

3110
03:10:19,480 --> 03:10:25,560
Let's get back to the necklace where did you steal it from mr. I don't steal well then tell me where you found it

3111
03:10:26,600 --> 03:10:35,560
Around here somewhere. Mrs. Philly Johns house, maybe I don't know who lives there. Oh, then you did steal the necklace. Well, that's a lot easier, you know

3112
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:40,600
How about a magic key that can open anything bolts and safes and stuff huh?

3113
03:10:41,320 --> 03:10:47,560
Listen, there's something I'd like to ask you a sack of gold wouldn't be half as much fun as a key that opens anything

3114
03:10:47,960 --> 03:10:54,920
Tell me is it possible that you rewrote woman poppers play? Yes, I did. It was really awful. Oh come on

3115
03:10:55,320 --> 03:11:02,360
I just needed some polishing and what's more? See this young man standing here? Well, he was really worried about your play

3116
03:11:02,360 --> 03:11:04,360
You know, I was just trying to help

3117
03:11:04,760 --> 03:11:06,760
Is this true

3118
03:11:06,840 --> 03:11:13,560
Saver the mercury of course, but then there's professional pride to think of I can explain papa

3119
03:11:13,560 --> 03:11:17,400
I saw you weren't happy about your play and I wanted it to be a big success

3120
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:22,920
Of course, I didn't want the spirit to write it himself. I'm gonna take the key

3121
03:11:23,080 --> 03:11:27,160
Yeah, I've just realized everybody the spirit didn't write all that himself

3122
03:11:27,720 --> 03:11:30,520
I've heard it before I thought it sounded familiar

3123
03:11:30,760 --> 03:11:32,760
There's that soul

3124
03:11:32,760 --> 03:11:37,800
Yes, he stole it from a play by somebody else this spirit is a cheat and a liar

3125
03:11:38,840 --> 03:11:40,840
Oh, dear me

3126
03:11:41,080 --> 03:11:44,280
Well, I can't help being so well read can I go back in the lamp now?

3127
03:11:48,520 --> 03:11:52,440
Sorry, master can't oblige have been put into an impossible situation

3128
03:11:52,840 --> 03:11:54,840
See you next week

3129
03:11:58,040 --> 03:12:02,840
But that's ridiculous not next week nor next month or even next year

3130
03:12:03,320 --> 03:12:10,040
Stinky this lamp is not yours besides I know exactly the sort of thing you'd ask for a master key or something

3131
03:12:11,400 --> 03:12:17,160
Ha, you think you can hide that magic lamp from me, do you? Well, there's no hiding place good enough for that

3132
03:12:17,880 --> 03:12:19,880
Hmm

3133
03:12:19,880 --> 03:12:23,880
Well, then I really do think that lamp is a bit too dangerous to have a rod

3134
03:12:24,440 --> 03:12:26,440
Hmm, I think you're right

3135
03:12:26,840 --> 03:12:29,400
Snuffkin, do you have any good ideas for us?

3136
03:12:29,400 --> 03:12:31,400
I

3137
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:45,400
Week is passed so we can summon the spirit again

3138
03:12:55,320 --> 03:12:57,320
There's the inspector

3139
03:13:00,120 --> 03:13:04,600
You do it snuffkin cold the spirit

3140
03:13:13,640 --> 03:13:16,200
Oh, no, not again. What do you want this time?

3141
03:13:16,920 --> 03:13:21,880
Can you bring the hobgoblin here? I suppose so I'll be back as soon as I can

3142
03:13:29,800 --> 03:13:31,800
But why an earth do you want the hobgoblin?

3143
03:13:33,560 --> 03:13:37,880
As far as I can see there's only one safe place for the lamp where no one can find it

3144
03:13:38,680 --> 03:13:42,440
And that's on another planet and the only one who can put it there is the hobgoblin

3145
03:13:43,480 --> 03:13:48,120
He's coming any minute. Geez that guy ever hard to find thank you

3146
03:13:48,520 --> 03:13:51,720
I've done my wake for this week. See you next week goodbye

3147
03:13:59,960 --> 03:14:01,960
Oh

3148
03:14:11,240 --> 03:14:18,360
And some of the hobgoblin took the magic ramp away and headed on some unknown planet and a good thing too

3149
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:23,240
It would really be very boring if all your wishes were granted wouldn't it

3150
03:14:24,200 --> 03:14:26,200
You

3151
03:14:26,600 --> 03:14:31,560
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements

3152
03:14:33,640 --> 03:14:38,920
We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

3153
03:14:41,240 --> 03:14:48,520
They're always happy and goes at play the moments are having fun day after day the

3154
03:14:48,520 --> 03:14:50,520
movements

3155
03:14:52,040 --> 03:14:54,040
The

3156
03:15:01,560 --> 03:15:03,560
No

3157
03:15:18,520 --> 03:15:32,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here

3158
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:42,240
with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements, so come

3159
03:15:42,240 --> 03:15:49,440
with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like

3160
03:15:49,440 --> 03:15:58,960
a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements, there

3161
03:15:58,960 --> 03:16:08,840
were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

3162
03:16:09,480 --> 03:16:15,880
The movements and movements were about to come.

3163
03:16:15,880 --> 03:16:39,880
Winter was just around the corner, and that was the time of year for movement to get

3164
03:16:39,880 --> 03:16:54,040
restless. Because this was the time of year for snuffkin to leave

3165
03:16:54,040 --> 03:17:12,040
movement valley on his yearly trek south.

3166
03:17:12,040 --> 03:17:15,040
Good morning, Papa. That bonfire looks inviting.

3167
03:17:15,040 --> 03:17:18,040
No, you're up already.

3168
03:17:18,040 --> 03:17:22,040
I'm scared and leaves this morning after that wind last night.

3169
03:17:22,040 --> 03:17:27,040
Yes, winders on the way. Oh, this is a lovely bonfire.

3170
03:17:27,040 --> 03:17:30,040
Yes, isn't it?

3171
03:17:30,040 --> 03:17:34,040
I guess we're hibernating again this winter. Are we moving, Papa?

3172
03:17:34,040 --> 03:17:38,040
Well, of course. We always hibernate in the winter.

3173
03:17:38,040 --> 03:17:44,040
If snuffkin says I could go with him, couldn't I give this winter a miss and hibernate longer next year?

3174
03:17:45,040 --> 03:17:47,040
Oh, please, movement, Papa.

3175
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:50,040
Snuffkin would rather go alone, I think, movement.

3176
03:17:50,040 --> 03:17:53,040
Would I might get him to train his mind?

3177
03:17:53,040 --> 03:17:57,040
That snuffkin's not really a person who likes to be pressed.

3178
03:17:57,040 --> 03:17:58,040
Why not?

3179
03:17:58,040 --> 03:18:05,040
Well, he's a very solitary person. His winter trip is the only time he can really be alone for a while.

3180
03:18:05,040 --> 03:18:08,040
I know, but I was just hoping.

3181
03:18:08,040 --> 03:18:11,040
Snuffkin likes you very much. I know that.

3182
03:18:12,040 --> 03:18:16,040
And I think that's why he stays in movement valley for the rest of the year.

3183
03:18:16,040 --> 03:18:21,040
But at heart, he's a vagabond and he needs time away from us.

3184
03:18:21,040 --> 03:18:24,040
He's not a family man, so he's free to do as he wants.

3185
03:18:24,040 --> 03:18:27,040
And as his friend, you should try to understand.

3186
03:18:27,040 --> 03:18:31,040
I know you'd like to go with him, but I don't think he's such a good idea.

3187
03:18:31,040 --> 03:18:34,040
He'd really hate to turn you down, I know.

3188
03:18:34,040 --> 03:18:35,040
I guess.

3189
03:18:35,040 --> 03:18:37,040
But he'd have to.

3190
03:18:41,040 --> 03:18:43,040
Oh.

3191
03:18:53,040 --> 03:18:56,040
Why aren't they biting?

3192
03:18:56,040 --> 03:18:59,040
I haven't had a proper catch for days.

3193
03:18:59,040 --> 03:19:01,040
Getting too cold, is that?

3194
03:19:04,040 --> 03:19:06,040
When are you leaving?

3195
03:19:06,040 --> 03:19:08,040
You're about to leave, aren't you?

3196
03:19:08,040 --> 03:19:10,040
Yes.

3197
03:19:12,040 --> 03:19:16,040
Could I ask you something?

3198
03:19:16,040 --> 03:19:18,040
What?

3199
03:19:18,040 --> 03:19:20,040
Don't go without telling me.

3200
03:19:20,040 --> 03:19:21,040
But why?

3201
03:19:21,040 --> 03:19:26,040
I'm always sad when you leave, even though I know you'll return in the spring.

3202
03:19:26,040 --> 03:19:29,040
Yeah. Me too, sort of.

3203
03:19:29,040 --> 03:19:32,040
That's why this year I'd plan to leave without saying anything.

3204
03:19:32,040 --> 03:19:36,040
But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly.

3205
03:19:36,040 --> 03:19:38,040
I'd like to wish you good luck and all that.

3206
03:19:38,040 --> 03:19:40,040
I miss you so much when you're away.

3207
03:19:40,040 --> 03:19:43,040
Please, Nuffkin.

3208
03:19:43,040 --> 03:19:45,040
Moomin, I have a better idea.

3209
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:47,040
I won't leave until after you've started hibernating.

3210
03:19:47,040 --> 03:19:49,040
Then you won't miss me, will you?

3211
03:19:49,040 --> 03:19:50,040
You're right.

3212
03:19:50,040 --> 03:19:52,040
I'll take my right idea, Snuffkin.

3213
03:19:52,040 --> 03:19:54,040
Then we won't really part at all, won't we?

3214
03:19:54,040 --> 03:19:55,040
Nope.

3215
03:19:55,040 --> 03:19:59,040
Because I promise to be back here in Moomin Valley before you've even woken up.

3216
03:19:59,040 --> 03:20:04,040
Wonderful. What a super idea.

3217
03:20:04,040 --> 03:20:07,040
Hey, Moomin!

3218
03:20:07,040 --> 03:20:09,040
Oh, Snuff.

3219
03:20:09,040 --> 03:20:11,040
Moomin, come here a minute.

3220
03:20:11,040 --> 03:20:13,040
There's something funny caught up in a tree.

3221
03:20:13,040 --> 03:20:15,040
What do you mean, funny?

3222
03:20:15,040 --> 03:20:16,040
I don't know exactly.

3223
03:20:16,040 --> 03:20:18,040
Never saw anything like it before.

3224
03:20:18,040 --> 03:20:20,040
Snork made a little my-founded first,

3225
03:20:20,040 --> 03:20:22,040
but it's too high to get it down.

3226
03:20:22,040 --> 03:20:24,040
Okay, I'll come have a look.

3227
03:20:29,040 --> 03:20:31,040
Be careful.

3228
03:20:33,040 --> 03:20:36,040
Be careful. What is it, Moomin?

3229
03:20:36,040 --> 03:20:41,040
I know what it is. It's a kite.

3230
03:20:41,040 --> 03:20:44,040
Oh, what?

3231
03:20:44,040 --> 03:20:46,040
A kite is something you find in the sky.

3232
03:20:46,040 --> 03:20:48,040
But it has no wings.

3233
03:20:48,040 --> 03:20:51,040
No, you send it up against the wind on a string.

3234
03:20:58,040 --> 03:21:01,040
Just a little bit more.

3235
03:21:07,040 --> 03:21:09,040
Wait a second.

3236
03:21:21,040 --> 03:21:23,040
Wait a second.

3237
03:21:25,040 --> 03:21:27,040
I'll throw it down.

3238
03:21:27,040 --> 03:21:30,040
That's all right.

3239
03:21:31,040 --> 03:21:34,040
Hey!

3240
03:21:38,040 --> 03:21:41,040
Oh, song. This is what a kite looks like.

3241
03:21:41,040 --> 03:21:43,040
Looks broken to me.

3242
03:21:43,040 --> 03:21:46,040
I'm sure we can fix it and make it fly.

3243
03:21:46,040 --> 03:21:47,040
Let's see.

3244
03:21:47,040 --> 03:21:49,040
Oh, no. The string must have broken

3245
03:21:49,040 --> 03:21:50,040
when someone was flying it

3246
03:21:50,040 --> 03:21:52,040
and the wind blew it down into the tree.

3247
03:21:52,040 --> 03:21:54,040
Well, why don't we repair it?

3248
03:21:54,040 --> 03:21:55,040
Yes, let's.

3249
03:21:55,040 --> 03:21:57,040
Looks pretty badly broken to me.

3250
03:21:58,040 --> 03:22:01,040
Well, I don't know. We'll have to see.

3251
03:22:04,040 --> 03:22:06,040
It is a kite, isn't it?

3252
03:22:06,040 --> 03:22:07,040
Can we mend it?

3253
03:22:07,040 --> 03:22:09,040
Maybe.

3254
03:22:12,040 --> 03:22:14,040
A very odd kite?

3255
03:22:14,040 --> 03:22:17,040
It must have come from far away.

3256
03:22:17,040 --> 03:22:19,040
You think it can be repaired?

3257
03:22:19,040 --> 03:22:20,040
Of course.

3258
03:22:20,040 --> 03:22:21,040
Well, come on, then.

3259
03:22:21,040 --> 03:22:23,040
Snork will help you repair it.

3260
03:22:23,040 --> 03:22:25,040
I can repair it without your help

3261
03:22:25,040 --> 03:22:28,040
as long as you can find us some really long string,

3262
03:22:28,040 --> 03:22:31,040
strong but not too thick of possible.

3263
03:22:31,040 --> 03:22:34,040
I think I have what you need, some string.

3264
03:22:34,040 --> 03:22:38,040
Good. Excellent. I'll start immediately.

3265
03:22:56,040 --> 03:22:57,040
Good.

3266
03:22:57,040 --> 03:22:58,040
Good.

3267
03:22:58,040 --> 03:22:59,040
Good.

3268
03:22:59,040 --> 03:23:00,040
Good.

3269
03:23:00,040 --> 03:23:01,040
Good.

3270
03:23:01,040 --> 03:23:02,040
Good.

3271
03:23:02,040 --> 03:23:03,040
Good.

3272
03:23:03,040 --> 03:23:04,040
Good.

3273
03:23:04,040 --> 03:23:05,040
Good.

3274
03:23:05,040 --> 03:23:06,040
Good.

3275
03:23:06,040 --> 03:23:07,040
Good.

3276
03:23:07,040 --> 03:23:08,040
Good.

3277
03:23:08,040 --> 03:23:09,040
Good.

3278
03:23:09,040 --> 03:23:10,040
Good.

3279
03:23:10,040 --> 03:23:11,040
Good.

3280
03:23:11,040 --> 03:23:12,040
Good.

3281
03:23:12,040 --> 03:23:13,040
Good.

3282
03:23:13,040 --> 03:23:14,040
Good.

3283
03:23:14,040 --> 03:23:15,040
Good.

3284
03:23:15,040 --> 03:23:16,040
Good.

3285
03:23:16,040 --> 03:23:17,040
Good.

3286
03:23:17,040 --> 03:23:18,040
Good.

3287
03:23:18,040 --> 03:23:19,040
Good.

3288
03:23:19,040 --> 03:23:20,040
Good.

3289
03:23:20,040 --> 03:23:21,040
Good.

3290
03:23:21,040 --> 03:23:22,040
Good.

3291
03:23:22,040 --> 03:23:23,040
Good.

3292
03:23:23,040 --> 03:23:24,040
Good.

3293
03:23:24,040 --> 03:23:25,040
Good.

3294
03:23:25,040 --> 03:23:26,040
Good.

3295
03:23:26,040 --> 03:23:27,040
Good.

3296
03:23:27,040 --> 03:23:28,040
Good.

3297
03:23:28,040 --> 03:23:29,040
Good.

3298
03:23:29,040 --> 03:23:30,040
Good.

3299
03:23:30,040 --> 03:23:31,040
Good.

3300
03:23:31,040 --> 03:23:32,040
Good.

3301
03:23:32,040 --> 03:23:33,040
Good.

3302
03:23:33,040 --> 03:23:34,040
Good.

3303
03:23:34,040 --> 03:23:35,040
Good.

3304
03:23:35,040 --> 03:23:36,040
Good.

3305
03:23:36,040 --> 03:23:37,040
Good.

3306
03:23:37,040 --> 03:23:38,040
Good.

3307
03:23:38,040 --> 03:23:39,040
Good.

3308
03:23:39,040 --> 03:23:44,040
This is a really exciting project I haven't flown a kite for years.

3309
03:23:44,040 --> 03:23:47,040
I do hope that string is long enough.

3310
03:23:47,040 --> 03:23:49,040
Snork, is this okay?

3311
03:23:49,040 --> 03:23:50,040
Fine.

3312
03:23:50,040 --> 03:23:51,040
Who's going to fly it?

3313
03:23:51,040 --> 03:23:52,040
I'll do it.

3314
03:23:52,040 --> 03:23:54,040
Okay, sniff.

3315
03:23:54,040 --> 03:23:55,040
Moving.

3316
03:23:55,040 --> 03:23:56,040
Hold the kite up high.

3317
03:23:56,040 --> 03:23:57,040
Like this.

3318
03:23:57,040 --> 03:23:58,040
Hmm.

3319
03:23:58,040 --> 03:23:59,040
All right, sniff.

3320
03:23:59,040 --> 03:24:00,040
Are you ready?

3321
03:24:00,040 --> 03:24:01,040
Yeah.

3322
03:24:01,040 --> 03:24:02,040
I'm ready.

3323
03:24:02,040 --> 03:24:03,040
Don't let go.

3324
03:24:03,040 --> 03:24:04,040
Do I say win?

3325
03:24:04,040 --> 03:24:05,040
Hmm.

3326
03:24:05,040 --> 03:24:06,040
Win, moment.

3327
03:24:06,040 --> 03:24:07,040
Oh.

3328
03:24:07,040 --> 03:24:08,040
Oh.

3329
03:24:08,040 --> 03:24:09,040
Oh.

3330
03:24:09,040 --> 03:24:10,040
It's falling.

3331
03:24:10,040 --> 03:24:11,040
Oh.

3332
03:24:11,040 --> 03:24:12,040
Oh.

3333
03:24:12,040 --> 03:24:13,040
Oh.

3334
03:24:13,040 --> 03:24:14,040
Oh.

3335
03:24:14,040 --> 03:24:15,040
Oh.

3336
03:24:15,040 --> 03:24:16,040
It's falling.

3337
03:24:16,040 --> 03:24:17,040
Oh.

3338
03:24:17,040 --> 03:24:18,040
Oh.

3339
03:24:18,040 --> 03:24:19,040
It's falling.

3340
03:24:19,040 --> 03:24:20,040
Try again.

3341
03:24:20,040 --> 03:24:23,040
And this time, start running them when the wind catches the kite.

3342
03:24:23,040 --> 03:24:25,040
You start paying out the light.

3343
03:24:25,040 --> 03:24:26,040
All right.

3344
03:24:26,040 --> 03:24:27,040
Fine.

3345
03:24:27,040 --> 03:24:28,040
Hold it up again, moment.

3346
03:24:28,040 --> 03:24:29,040
Right.

3347
03:24:29,040 --> 03:24:30,040
Ready?

3348
03:24:30,040 --> 03:24:31,040
Yeah.

3349
03:24:31,040 --> 03:24:32,040
I'm ready.

3350
03:24:32,040 --> 03:24:34,040
Let go of it.

3351
03:24:34,040 --> 03:24:36,040
Easy going up yet.

3352
03:24:36,040 --> 03:24:40,040
No, it isn't.

3353
03:24:40,040 --> 03:24:42,040
Stop, sniff.

3354
03:24:42,040 --> 03:24:44,040
You're breaking the kite.

3355
03:24:44,040 --> 03:24:45,040
Hmm.

3356
03:24:45,040 --> 03:24:48,040
I don't think this kite's any good for anybody.

3357
03:24:48,040 --> 03:24:50,040
The kite's fine.

3358
03:24:50,040 --> 03:24:52,040
It's just that the wind is too weak.

3359
03:24:52,040 --> 03:24:53,040
All right.

3360
03:24:53,040 --> 03:24:55,040
We'll have to wait for it to get stronger.

3361
03:24:55,040 --> 03:24:58,040
Pretty though, we certainly had a good strong wind yesterday.

3362
03:24:58,040 --> 03:25:00,040
Is it okay?

3363
03:25:00,040 --> 03:25:01,040
Hmm.

3364
03:25:01,040 --> 03:25:04,040
I think the wind is getting stronger, moment.

3365
03:25:16,040 --> 03:25:17,040
Oh.

3366
03:25:21,040 --> 03:25:22,040
There it goes.

3367
03:25:29,040 --> 03:25:31,040
Let me hold the string, moment.

3368
03:25:34,040 --> 03:25:36,040
Boy, this wind is really strong.

3369
03:25:36,040 --> 03:25:38,040
Can I let out the string now?

3370
03:25:38,040 --> 03:25:39,040
Do it slowly, mind.

3371
03:25:39,040 --> 03:25:40,040
All right.

3372
03:25:41,040 --> 03:25:43,040
Let me do it.

3373
03:25:43,040 --> 03:25:44,040
Snip, come on.

3374
03:25:44,040 --> 03:25:45,040
It's my turn.

3375
03:25:45,040 --> 03:25:46,040
Let me break your kiln, little lion.

3376
03:25:46,040 --> 03:25:47,040
Why not?

3377
03:25:47,040 --> 03:25:49,040
Because you don't weigh enough to hold it.

3378
03:25:49,040 --> 03:25:50,040
I'm very strong.

3379
03:25:50,040 --> 03:25:51,040
The wind is quite dry.

3380
03:25:51,040 --> 03:25:52,040
You go up with it.

3381
03:26:04,040 --> 03:26:05,040
You have more sniff.

3382
03:26:05,040 --> 03:26:06,040
Yes, Papa?

3383
03:26:06,040 --> 03:26:08,040
It is better to hold it for a while.

3384
03:26:09,040 --> 03:26:11,040
Well, yes, you'd like it.

3385
03:26:11,040 --> 03:26:13,040
Hold it really tight, then.

3386
03:26:18,040 --> 03:26:19,040
All right.

3387
03:26:19,040 --> 03:26:21,040
I could do this long before it was born.

3388
03:26:22,040 --> 03:26:23,040
Oops.

3389
03:26:26,040 --> 03:26:27,040
What's happening?

3390
03:26:29,040 --> 03:26:31,040
Papa, why did you drop quickly?

3391
03:26:31,040 --> 03:26:34,040
And I'm winding, I'm winding.

3392
03:26:35,040 --> 03:26:37,040
Faster, oh, wind it faster.

3393
03:26:48,040 --> 03:26:50,040
That was definitely not my fault.

3394
03:26:50,040 --> 03:26:52,040
Of course it wasn't.

3395
03:26:52,040 --> 03:26:54,040
With such a strong wind up there,

3396
03:26:54,040 --> 03:26:57,040
I think we have to lower the centre of gravity a bit.

3397
03:27:00,040 --> 03:27:02,040
The kite's all right, Papa.

3398
03:27:03,040 --> 03:27:05,040
Hmm, maybe it would take me with it.

3399
03:27:20,040 --> 03:27:21,040
That's it.

3400
03:27:21,040 --> 03:27:24,040
I suppose that's to stop it from spinning around.

3401
03:27:24,040 --> 03:27:25,040
Is it snorke?

3402
03:27:25,040 --> 03:27:26,040
Yes, that's right.

3403
03:27:33,040 --> 03:27:35,040
What is it?

3404
03:27:37,040 --> 03:27:39,040
Listen, I'm going to ride that kite.

3405
03:27:39,040 --> 03:27:41,040
What did you say?

3406
03:27:41,040 --> 03:27:44,040
I think it's going to be okay now.

3407
03:27:44,040 --> 03:27:46,040
If I hold on really tight,

3408
03:27:46,040 --> 03:27:49,040
I think I could have a wonderful ride on that kite.

3409
03:27:49,040 --> 03:27:51,040
Yes, maybe it'd be wonderful while you're up in the sky,

3410
03:27:51,040 --> 03:27:54,040
but you've seen how fast it can come down again.

3411
03:27:54,040 --> 03:27:57,040
But the snorke just said it won't fall down again.

3412
03:27:57,040 --> 03:27:58,040
Even so.

3413
03:27:58,040 --> 03:28:00,040
I'm going to do it.

3414
03:28:00,040 --> 03:28:01,040
But no one must see me,

3415
03:28:01,040 --> 03:28:04,040
or they might try to stop me if they guess what I'm up to.

3416
03:28:04,040 --> 03:28:06,040
Oh, please don't do it.

3417
03:28:06,040 --> 03:28:08,040
What are you doing?

3418
03:28:08,040 --> 03:28:09,040
Listen carefully.

3419
03:28:09,040 --> 03:28:10,040
Yes.

3420
03:28:11,040 --> 03:28:14,040
When we fly the kite next time.

3421
03:28:14,040 --> 03:28:15,040
Huh?

3422
03:28:15,040 --> 03:28:18,040
What are you two whispering about?

3423
03:28:18,040 --> 03:28:19,040
We weren't snorke-made,

3424
03:28:19,040 --> 03:28:23,040
and I was just saying to sniff that the kite wouldn't fall down again.

3425
03:28:23,040 --> 03:28:25,040
It won't, snorke is fixed it.

3426
03:28:25,040 --> 03:28:27,040
But you can't be absolutely sure.

3427
03:28:27,040 --> 03:28:29,040
And you'll be holding the kite won't you sniff?

3428
03:28:29,040 --> 03:28:32,040
Now then, do you want to do it, moving?

3429
03:28:32,040 --> 03:28:33,040
Yes.

3430
03:28:33,040 --> 03:28:35,040
And this time I'll let out all the line.

3431
03:28:35,040 --> 03:28:38,040
And sniff, you could hold it up, okay?

3432
03:28:38,040 --> 03:28:40,040
Yes, that's fine.

3433
03:28:40,040 --> 03:28:41,040
No.

3434
03:28:41,040 --> 03:28:43,040
I'm counting on you, sniff.

3435
03:28:43,040 --> 03:28:45,040
And so am I, sniff?

3436
03:28:45,040 --> 03:28:46,040
Hmm.

3437
03:28:55,040 --> 03:28:57,040
Are you sure you'll be all right?

3438
03:28:57,040 --> 03:28:58,040
Of course I will, silly.

3439
03:28:58,040 --> 03:29:00,040
Well, I'm not so sure.

3440
03:29:00,040 --> 03:29:02,040
Why don't you keep your eyes closed then?

3441
03:29:02,040 --> 03:29:03,040
Good idea.

3442
03:29:05,040 --> 03:29:06,040
Okay, sniff.

3443
03:29:06,040 --> 03:29:08,040
Let go of it when I say ready.

3444
03:29:08,040 --> 03:29:09,040
Hi.

3445
03:29:14,040 --> 03:29:15,040
Ready.

3446
03:29:28,040 --> 03:29:30,040
Hi.

3447
03:29:30,040 --> 03:29:32,040
Hi.

3448
03:29:32,040 --> 03:29:34,040
Hi.

3449
03:29:34,040 --> 03:29:36,040
Hi.

3450
03:29:36,040 --> 03:29:38,040
Hi.

3451
03:29:38,040 --> 03:29:40,040
Hi.

3452
03:29:46,040 --> 03:29:48,040
Hi.

3453
03:29:48,040 --> 03:29:50,040
Hi.

3454
03:29:50,040 --> 03:29:52,040
Hi.

3455
03:29:52,040 --> 03:29:54,040
Hi.

3456
03:29:54,040 --> 03:29:55,040
That's it.

3457
03:29:55,040 --> 03:29:56,040
That's all of the line.

3458
03:29:56,040 --> 03:29:58,040
It's very high.

3459
03:29:58,040 --> 03:30:00,040
Must be some wind up there.

3460
03:30:00,040 --> 03:30:02,040
It's flying really well, isn't it?

3461
03:30:02,040 --> 03:30:04,040
Certainly is.

3462
03:30:04,040 --> 03:30:06,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3463
03:30:06,040 --> 03:30:08,040
This is getting bumpy.

3464
03:30:08,040 --> 03:30:10,040
Oh!

3465
03:30:10,040 --> 03:30:14,040
What's that?

3466
03:30:14,040 --> 03:30:17,040
Let's see if there's something very strange happening on that kite.

3467
03:30:17,040 --> 03:30:19,040
What is it?

3468
03:30:19,040 --> 03:30:21,040
I can't see properly from here.

3469
03:30:21,040 --> 03:30:23,040
I saw something.

3470
03:30:23,040 --> 03:30:25,040
Could it be a bird, maybe?

3471
03:30:25,040 --> 03:30:27,040
The kite is turned again.

3472
03:30:27,040 --> 03:30:29,040
But it wasn't a bird.

3473
03:30:29,040 --> 03:30:31,040
Or a twig or something, then.

3474
03:30:31,040 --> 03:30:33,040
I doubt it.

3475
03:30:33,040 --> 03:30:35,040
Don't you see the back of the kite from where you are, sniff?

3476
03:30:35,040 --> 03:30:37,040
No, Mom and Mama, because my eyes are closed.

3477
03:30:37,040 --> 03:30:39,040
Oh.

3478
03:30:39,040 --> 03:30:41,040
I think I know who it is.

3479
03:30:41,040 --> 03:30:43,040
Little Mai.

3480
03:30:43,040 --> 03:30:45,040
What?

3481
03:30:45,040 --> 03:30:49,040
No, I haven't seen one of my four.

3482
03:30:49,040 --> 03:30:51,040
She seems to have disappeared.

3483
03:30:51,040 --> 03:30:53,040
Don't ask me anything.

3484
03:30:53,040 --> 03:30:55,040
Sniff, what do you mean?

3485
03:30:55,040 --> 03:30:57,040
No, she was dead set on riding the kite.

3486
03:30:57,040 --> 03:30:59,040
I couldn't stop her.

3487
03:30:59,040 --> 03:31:01,040
What?

3488
03:31:01,040 --> 03:31:03,040
Moment, bring it down very slowly.

3489
03:31:03,040 --> 03:31:05,040
Huh?

3490
03:31:13,040 --> 03:31:15,040
Take it easy, Moment. That wind is strong.

3491
03:31:15,040 --> 03:31:17,040
It could break the line.

3492
03:31:19,040 --> 03:31:21,040
But that was what it planned last best stream.

3493
03:31:21,040 --> 03:31:23,040
It's the knot I wore in the board knot.

3494
03:31:23,040 --> 03:31:29,040
The one between our line and the bit that was still hanging from the kite when we found it.

3495
03:31:29,040 --> 03:31:33,040
The line is fine, if the knot is another one.

3496
03:31:39,040 --> 03:31:41,040
Oh my God.

3497
03:31:41,040 --> 03:31:43,040
Oh my God.

3498
03:31:43,040 --> 03:31:45,040
Oh my God.

3499
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:47,040
Oh my God.

3500
03:31:47,040 --> 03:31:49,040
Oh my God.

3501
03:31:49,040 --> 03:31:51,040
Oh my God.

3502
03:31:57,040 --> 03:31:59,040
Hang on tight, little Mai.

3503
03:31:59,040 --> 03:32:01,040
That wind is getting stronger.

3504
03:32:03,040 --> 03:32:07,040
Oh, this is more scarier than I thought.

3505
03:32:09,040 --> 03:32:13,040
I'll just have to hang on as best as I can.

3506
03:32:13,040 --> 03:32:15,040
Don't move around so much.

3507
03:32:15,040 --> 03:32:17,040
I can't help it.

3508
03:32:17,040 --> 03:32:19,040
It's almost down.

3509
03:32:19,040 --> 03:32:21,040
What?

3510
03:32:21,040 --> 03:32:23,040
Oh.

3511
03:32:23,040 --> 03:32:25,040
Oh.

3512
03:32:25,040 --> 03:32:27,040
Oh.

3513
03:32:27,040 --> 03:32:29,040
Oh.

3514
03:32:29,040 --> 03:32:31,040
Oh my God.

3515
03:32:31,040 --> 03:32:33,040
It opened.

3516
03:32:33,040 --> 03:32:35,040
Come on.

3517
03:32:35,040 --> 03:32:37,040
Sniff, get up.

3518
03:32:37,040 --> 03:32:39,040
All right.

3519
03:32:39,040 --> 03:32:41,040
Sniff, pull yourself together.

3520
03:32:41,040 --> 03:32:43,040
Yes, all right.

3521
03:32:43,040 --> 03:32:45,040
She's being blown away towards lonely mountains.

3522
03:32:45,040 --> 03:32:47,040
Mama.

3523
03:32:47,040 --> 03:32:49,040
Oh.

3524
03:32:49,040 --> 03:32:51,040
I do hope little Mai really is indestructible.

3525
03:33:03,040 --> 03:33:07,040
Where in the world is this kite taking me?

3526
03:33:07,040 --> 03:33:09,040
All lonely mountains.

3527
03:33:09,040 --> 03:33:11,040
I'm a long way from home.

3528
03:33:11,040 --> 03:33:13,040
I'm a long way from home.

3529
03:33:13,040 --> 03:33:15,040
Little Mai.

3530
03:33:15,040 --> 03:33:17,040
Little Mai.

3531
03:33:17,040 --> 03:33:19,040
And now she's going towards the forest of witches.

3532
03:33:19,040 --> 03:33:23,040
She'll be all right if she fell into a tree when she...

3533
03:33:23,040 --> 03:33:25,040
I can't see her.

3534
03:33:25,040 --> 03:33:27,040
There's no sign of her.

3535
03:33:27,040 --> 03:33:29,040
Well, I'm almost sure she was heading this way.

3536
03:33:33,040 --> 03:33:35,040
What is it, Sniff?

3537
03:33:35,040 --> 03:33:37,040
Imagine she might have fallen somewhere.

3538
03:33:37,040 --> 03:33:39,040
She might be lying there waiting for help.

3539
03:33:39,040 --> 03:33:41,040
Oh, stop imagining things, Sniff.

3540
03:33:41,040 --> 03:33:43,040
She's still up there.

3541
03:33:43,040 --> 03:33:45,040
I'm sure of it.

3542
03:33:45,040 --> 03:33:47,040
Huh?

3543
03:33:47,040 --> 03:33:49,040
What is it, Papa?

3544
03:33:49,040 --> 03:33:51,040
I saw something up there.

3545
03:33:51,040 --> 03:33:53,040
Little Mai?

3546
03:33:53,040 --> 03:33:55,040
No, Sniff.

3547
03:33:55,040 --> 03:33:57,040
No, it looked more like the Harb Goblin riding his panther through the sky.

3548
03:33:57,040 --> 03:33:59,040
Really?

3549
03:33:59,040 --> 03:34:01,040
Did you see that?

3550
03:34:01,040 --> 03:34:03,040
Did you?

3551
03:34:03,040 --> 03:34:05,040
You found the Mai.

3552
03:34:05,040 --> 03:34:07,040
No, the Harb Goblin.

3553
03:34:07,040 --> 03:34:08,040
Then it was him.

3554
03:34:08,040 --> 03:34:10,040
Now, Harb Goblin, we're looking for Little Mai.

3555
03:34:10,040 --> 03:34:12,040
And all you can think of is the Harb Goblin.

3556
03:34:22,040 --> 03:34:24,040
Oh, come on.

3557
03:34:24,040 --> 03:34:26,040
I won't you come in.

3558
03:34:38,040 --> 03:34:40,040
Stop!

3559
03:34:40,040 --> 03:34:42,040
Stop it!

3560
03:34:42,040 --> 03:34:44,040
Stop it!

3561
03:34:44,040 --> 03:34:46,040
Let's go right here!

3562
03:34:46,040 --> 03:34:48,040
Stop!

3563
03:34:58,040 --> 03:35:00,040
Where could she be?

3564
03:35:00,040 --> 03:35:02,040
This is no good.

3565
03:35:02,040 --> 03:35:06,040
We'll never find her wondering about like this.

3566
03:35:06,040 --> 03:35:08,040
Moomin, over here.

3567
03:35:08,040 --> 03:35:10,040
You found her?

3568
03:35:14,040 --> 03:35:16,040
There she is.

3569
03:35:22,040 --> 03:35:24,040
Try to cheer up, Snork Maiden.

3570
03:35:24,040 --> 03:35:26,040
I'll try.

3571
03:35:26,040 --> 03:35:28,040
Don't worry, Snork Maiden.

3572
03:35:28,040 --> 03:35:30,040
Moomin, Papa, will find her for sure.

3573
03:35:30,040 --> 03:35:32,040
Eh?

3574
03:35:32,040 --> 03:35:36,040
Mama, Snork Maiden!

3575
03:35:36,040 --> 03:35:38,040
I'm so glad to see you.

3576
03:35:38,040 --> 03:35:42,040
But I just knew you'd be all right.

3577
03:35:42,040 --> 03:35:46,040
Like Moomin Mama said, Little Mai really is indestructible.

3578
03:35:46,040 --> 03:35:50,040
But just possibly it served her right to have her hair pulled.

3579
03:36:02,040 --> 03:36:04,040
There's still no sign of Little Mai?

3580
03:36:04,040 --> 03:36:06,040
No.

3581
03:36:12,040 --> 03:36:14,040
Be careful, Moomin!

3582
03:36:20,040 --> 03:36:22,040
Come on!

3583
03:36:26,040 --> 03:36:28,040
Hang on, Moomin!

3584
03:36:28,040 --> 03:36:30,040
To me, Moomin Papa!

3585
03:36:32,040 --> 03:36:36,040
Finally, Moomin was rescued too.

3586
03:36:36,040 --> 03:36:40,040
But he almost certainly had a fine worst scare than Little Mai.

3587
03:36:44,040 --> 03:36:50,040
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

3588
03:36:50,040 --> 03:36:58,040
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

3589
03:36:58,040 --> 03:37:02,040
They're always happy and goes at play.

3590
03:37:02,040 --> 03:37:06,040
The Moons are having fun day after day.

3591
03:37:06,040 --> 03:37:10,040
The Moons!

3592
03:37:10,040 --> 03:37:14,040
The Moons!

3593
03:37:14,040 --> 03:37:18,040
The Moons!

3594
03:37:28,040 --> 03:37:32,040
The Moons!

3595
03:37:58,040 --> 03:38:02,040
So come with me, give me your hand.

3596
03:38:02,040 --> 03:38:04,040
I'll take you up to Moomin Land.

3597
03:38:04,040 --> 03:38:08,040
You can fly just like a bird.

3598
03:38:08,040 --> 03:38:10,040
Sing that song ever.

3599
03:38:10,040 --> 03:38:12,040
There were the Moons!

3600
03:38:12,040 --> 03:38:16,040
There were the Moons!

3601
03:38:16,040 --> 03:38:18,040
There were the Moons!

3602
03:38:18,040 --> 03:38:22,040
There were the Moons!

3603
03:38:22,040 --> 03:38:24,040
There were the Moons!

3604
03:38:24,040 --> 03:38:28,040
There were the Moons!

3605
03:38:42,040 --> 03:38:46,040
These days, Moomin and Snuffkin were together even more than ever.

3606
03:38:54,040 --> 03:38:58,040
Winter would hit Moomin valley any day now.

3607
03:38:58,040 --> 03:39:02,040
And then they would have to part.

3608
03:39:02,040 --> 03:39:08,040
Moomin to go into hibernation and Snuffkin to leave for his trip south.

3609
03:39:10,040 --> 03:39:14,040
Little Mai, you look sad for something upset you?

3610
03:39:14,040 --> 03:39:16,040
Where are you off to, Moomin?

3611
03:39:16,040 --> 03:39:18,040
To the lonely mountains.

3612
03:39:18,040 --> 03:39:22,040
How come you two were always stealing off somewhere?

3613
03:39:22,040 --> 03:39:24,040
We're not stealing off.

3614
03:39:24,040 --> 03:39:26,040
We're just going for a walk to lonely mountains.

3615
03:39:26,040 --> 03:39:28,040
Just the two of you?

3616
03:39:28,040 --> 03:39:32,040
You're even worse than usual, never taking any of us with you.

3617
03:39:32,040 --> 03:39:34,040
I hadn't noticed are we really doing that?

3618
03:39:34,040 --> 03:39:36,040
I'm not sure, maybe we are.

3619
03:39:36,040 --> 03:39:38,040
No, maybe's about it.

3620
03:39:38,040 --> 03:39:40,040
Let me tell you, it's very rude.

3621
03:39:40,040 --> 03:39:42,040
But we were just off for a walk.

3622
03:39:42,040 --> 03:39:44,040
I know.

3623
03:39:44,040 --> 03:39:46,040
Well then, why are you going?

3624
03:39:46,040 --> 03:39:48,040
It'll start snowing any day now, little Mai,

3625
03:39:48,040 --> 03:39:50,040
and then we won't be able to go anywhere, will we?

3626
03:39:50,040 --> 03:39:52,040
Look at Moomin Valley from above before that happens.

3627
03:39:52,040 --> 03:39:54,040
A likely story.

3628
03:39:54,040 --> 03:39:56,040
But it's true, I'm off very soon,

3629
03:39:56,040 --> 03:40:00,040
and I wanted to see it all, to give me a picture to remember while I'm walking.

3630
03:40:00,040 --> 03:40:02,040
Hmm.

3631
03:40:02,040 --> 03:40:04,040
Did you hear that, Snuffkin?

3632
03:40:08,040 --> 03:40:10,040
Moomin, do you mind if we come along with you?

3633
03:40:10,040 --> 03:40:12,040
Of course not.

3634
03:40:12,040 --> 03:40:14,040
You see, we thought you were probably plotting something secret

3635
03:40:14,040 --> 03:40:16,040
and weren't letting any of us in on it.

3636
03:40:16,040 --> 03:40:18,040
Oh, come on, we don't have any secrets from you.

3637
03:40:18,040 --> 03:40:20,040
It's just a, well, you know what I mean.

3638
03:40:20,040 --> 03:40:22,040
Snuffkin will be leaving for months, months very soon.

3639
03:40:22,040 --> 03:40:24,040
Never mind, off we go.

3640
03:40:32,040 --> 03:40:36,040
It would be fun to see it all from here in the middle of winter all white.

3641
03:40:36,040 --> 03:40:38,040
Must be very beautiful.

3642
03:40:38,040 --> 03:40:40,040
I don't think so.

3643
03:40:40,040 --> 03:40:42,040
With everything white and clean.

3644
03:40:42,040 --> 03:40:44,040
In summer, it's very beautiful.

3645
03:40:44,040 --> 03:40:46,040
Well, I'm coming back here in winter.

3646
03:40:46,040 --> 03:40:50,040
Well, I'm coming back here in winter to see it for myself.

3647
03:40:50,040 --> 03:40:52,040
You can't do that, you're hibernating.

3648
03:40:52,040 --> 03:40:54,040
Well, maybe not.

3649
03:40:54,040 --> 03:40:56,040
I thought that this year I tried to keep awake all winter.

3650
03:40:56,040 --> 03:40:58,040
You mean just like Moomin and I did last year?

3651
03:40:58,040 --> 03:41:00,040
Yes!

3652
03:41:00,040 --> 03:41:02,040
You could never do it.

3653
03:41:02,040 --> 03:41:04,040
What about you? Are you hibernating?

3654
03:41:04,040 --> 03:41:08,040
I'm not all that mad about the snow and the cold and darks all hibernate.

3655
03:41:10,040 --> 03:41:12,040
I'm very happy to be going home.

3656
03:41:12,040 --> 03:41:14,040
I've seen it all now.

3657
03:41:14,040 --> 03:41:16,040
Well, we didn't ask you to come along little life.

3658
03:41:16,040 --> 03:41:20,040
Well, I know we go take a look at that beautiful lake against Sniff.

3659
03:41:20,040 --> 03:41:22,040
The one with the golden fish.

3660
03:41:22,040 --> 03:41:24,040
Oh, no, that's too far away.

3661
03:41:24,040 --> 03:41:26,040
Ah, you're just afraid of the forest of witches, aren't you, Sniff?

3662
03:41:26,040 --> 03:41:28,040
Not at all, I'm not a bit scared.

3663
03:41:28,040 --> 03:41:32,040
Hey, look! Who's that?

3664
03:41:36,040 --> 03:41:38,040
Nobody, I know.

3665
03:41:38,040 --> 03:41:40,040
Wonder what she's doing here.

3666
03:41:40,040 --> 03:41:42,040
Sitting down.

3667
03:41:42,040 --> 03:41:44,040
Hello there.

3668
03:41:44,040 --> 03:41:46,040
Right there.

3669
03:41:46,040 --> 03:41:48,040
What are you doing up there?

3670
03:41:48,040 --> 03:41:50,040
Ah, I'm waiting.

3671
03:41:50,040 --> 03:41:52,040
For what? For grandma?

3672
03:41:52,040 --> 03:41:54,040
Out here all alone.

3673
03:41:54,040 --> 03:41:58,040
Well, grandma told me there was a big rock by the path leading up to Lonely Mountains and to wait there.

3674
03:41:58,040 --> 03:42:02,040
But there are other rocks by the path, you know?

3675
03:42:02,040 --> 03:42:04,040
Or there?

3676
03:42:04,040 --> 03:42:08,040
But this is the only one I've seen so far.

3677
03:42:08,040 --> 03:42:12,040
Your grandma must be crazy or something making you wait in a place like this.

3678
03:42:12,040 --> 03:42:16,040
No, our house is in the forest and she's coming to show me the way.

3679
03:42:16,040 --> 03:42:18,040
In the forest?

3680
03:42:18,040 --> 03:42:20,040
You mean the forest of witches?

3681
03:42:20,040 --> 03:42:22,040
Yes, I suppose so.

3682
03:42:22,040 --> 03:42:24,040
It's not very far from here.

3683
03:42:24,040 --> 03:42:26,040
That's it, definitely.

3684
03:42:26,040 --> 03:42:28,040
How long have you been waiting here?

3685
03:42:28,040 --> 03:42:30,040
Oh, about an hour.

3686
03:42:30,040 --> 03:42:32,040
One hour?

3687
03:42:32,040 --> 03:42:34,040
She's not very punctual.

3688
03:42:34,040 --> 03:42:36,040
Perhaps I was early.

3689
03:42:36,040 --> 03:42:38,040
Yes, she was an hour early.

3690
03:42:38,040 --> 03:42:40,040
Oh, it's grandma.

3691
03:42:42,040 --> 03:42:44,040
Welcome, Alicia.

3692
03:42:48,040 --> 03:42:52,040
Where do you find all these children, my dear?

3693
03:42:52,040 --> 03:42:56,040
I was waiting here all alone and then they came along the path and wanted to help.

3694
03:42:56,040 --> 03:42:58,040
Very kind of you, I'm sure.

3695
03:42:58,040 --> 03:43:00,040
Well, don't just stand there, my dear.

3696
03:43:00,040 --> 03:43:02,040
Let's go.

3697
03:43:02,040 --> 03:43:04,040
Come along.

3698
03:43:08,040 --> 03:43:10,040
Excuse me, ma'am.

3699
03:43:10,040 --> 03:43:12,040
But don't you live in the forest?

3700
03:43:12,040 --> 03:43:14,040
Indeed, I do.

3701
03:43:14,040 --> 03:43:16,040
In what part of it?

3702
03:43:16,040 --> 03:43:18,040
Let me see.

3703
03:43:18,040 --> 03:43:20,040
It must be about right in the middle.

3704
03:43:20,040 --> 03:43:22,040
Interesting.

3705
03:43:22,040 --> 03:43:24,040
The only place I know of is an old house.

3706
03:43:24,040 --> 03:43:28,040
The only place I know of is an old house where they say which is used to live.

3707
03:43:28,040 --> 03:43:30,040
You don't say a man.

3708
03:43:30,040 --> 03:43:32,040
Well, what do you know?

3709
03:43:32,040 --> 03:43:34,040
What will he think of next?

3710
03:43:46,040 --> 03:43:48,040
Her grandmother is...

3711
03:43:48,040 --> 03:43:50,040
A witch, I think?

3712
03:43:50,040 --> 03:43:52,040
But surely, they don't exist.

3713
03:43:52,040 --> 03:43:56,040
Of course not, like dragons don't exist.

3714
03:43:56,040 --> 03:43:58,040
Well, she doesn't seem like a nasty one.

3715
03:43:58,040 --> 03:44:00,040
How can you tell, Moments?

3716
03:44:00,040 --> 03:44:04,040
I don't think that nice girl would have a bad one for a grandma.

3717
03:44:04,040 --> 03:44:06,040
Perhaps not.

3718
03:44:06,040 --> 03:44:10,040
So tell me what makes you think she's a witch, eh?

3719
03:44:10,040 --> 03:44:14,040
Who else could live in that forest, Papa?

3720
03:44:14,040 --> 03:44:16,040
I can't think of anyone right now, but some people would like it.

3721
03:44:16,040 --> 03:44:18,040
Yes, I suppose you're right.

3722
03:44:18,040 --> 03:44:20,040
I hope you are.

3723
03:44:20,040 --> 03:44:24,040
Well, I've lived in Moomin Valley for a long time and I've never once seen a witch.

3724
03:44:24,040 --> 03:44:26,040
So they don't exist?

3725
03:44:30,040 --> 03:44:32,040
Yes.

3726
03:44:32,040 --> 03:44:34,040
Oh, stop working now, Snork. Dinner's ready.

3727
03:44:34,040 --> 03:44:36,040
Fine, coming.

3728
03:44:40,040 --> 03:44:42,040
No wonder it's so light. Look, the moon is up.

3729
03:44:42,040 --> 03:44:44,040
Snork, Maiden.

3730
03:44:44,040 --> 03:44:48,040
I think it would be very wise for you to stay with the Moomin's from tonight on.

3731
03:44:48,040 --> 03:44:50,040
Why on earth do you think that's Snork?

3732
03:44:50,040 --> 03:44:54,040
I've decided not to hibernate this winter.

3733
03:44:54,040 --> 03:44:56,040
Why ever not?

3734
03:44:56,040 --> 03:45:00,040
I want to complete the blueprint for my new flying ship by next spring.

3735
03:45:00,040 --> 03:45:04,040
For a real inventor, sleep is an unnecessary luxury.

3736
03:45:04,040 --> 03:45:08,040
Science, my dear Snork Maiden, will not wait while inventors take a nap.

3737
03:45:08,040 --> 03:45:12,040
But you know, dear Snork, how dependent you are on your sleep.

3738
03:45:12,040 --> 03:45:14,040
I'll stay with you.

3739
03:45:14,040 --> 03:45:17,040
Very well, then, this winter I will hibernate with the Moomin's.

3740
03:45:17,040 --> 03:45:21,040
Excellent. Shall we have dinner? I'm ready now.

3741
03:45:31,040 --> 03:45:35,040
Well, certainly, Snork. Snork Maiden will be just fine here with us.

3742
03:45:35,040 --> 03:45:37,040
Thank you.

3743
03:45:37,040 --> 03:45:41,040
This is nice for Moomin, too. Now he'll have Snork Maiden to keep him company.

3744
03:45:41,040 --> 03:45:43,040
Yes.

3745
03:45:43,040 --> 03:45:47,040
But who needs company when they're hibernating? After all, Moomin will be fast asleep.

3746
03:45:47,040 --> 03:45:49,040
Never the less.

3747
03:45:49,040 --> 03:45:53,040
Sleeping is much nicer when someone else sleeps in the same room.

3748
03:45:53,040 --> 03:45:55,040
When do we start hibernating, do you think?

3749
03:45:55,040 --> 03:45:57,040
With weather like this in another few days, I guess.

3750
03:45:57,040 --> 03:45:59,040
So early?

3751
03:45:59,040 --> 03:46:01,040
We'll have snow before the week is out.

3752
03:46:01,040 --> 03:46:03,040
Well, good luck with your new blueprint, Snork.

3753
03:46:03,040 --> 03:46:07,040
I look forward to seeing your flying ship in the spring.

3754
03:46:07,040 --> 03:46:11,040
Come this time next year. I'll definitely be flying about.

3755
03:46:14,040 --> 03:46:19,040
Thanks again for taking Snork Maiden. That's not trouble at all. Good night, then.

3756
03:46:19,040 --> 03:46:21,040
Good night, Snork.

3757
03:46:21,040 --> 03:46:23,040
See you, Snork Maiden.

3758
03:46:23,040 --> 03:46:27,040
Good luck this winter, Snork.

3759
03:46:31,040 --> 03:46:37,040
Thank goodness that last I can really concentrate on my work.

3760
03:46:44,040 --> 03:46:47,040
I don't believe this.

3761
03:46:51,040 --> 03:46:53,040
Am I hallucinating?

3762
03:47:07,040 --> 03:47:09,040
Oh!

3763
03:47:14,040 --> 03:47:20,040
Oh, which I'm sure it was. I'm positive. I'm a broomstick.

3764
03:47:20,040 --> 03:47:25,040
When the snork gets an idea in his head, it's not much room for anyone or anything else.

3765
03:47:25,040 --> 03:47:28,040
I hope you'll succeed this time.

3766
03:47:28,040 --> 03:47:31,040
At least in my dream that rounding really flew well.

3767
03:47:31,040 --> 03:47:35,040
I often dream that I fly, but I wouldn't dream of trying it out.

3768
03:47:35,040 --> 03:47:39,040
Snork must have had some sort of a new idea.

3769
03:47:39,040 --> 03:47:41,040
It's Snork.

3770
03:47:44,040 --> 03:47:48,040
What's the matter?

3771
03:47:56,040 --> 03:48:00,040
Oh, that's my piece of cake.

3772
03:48:00,040 --> 03:48:03,040
You look like you've seen a ghost.

3773
03:48:03,040 --> 03:48:06,040
Not a ghost. She laughed at me.

3774
03:48:06,040 --> 03:48:09,040
Where did? She was flying on a broom.

3775
03:48:09,040 --> 03:48:10,040
No engine at all.

3776
03:48:10,040 --> 03:48:12,040
Are you talking about the witch?

3777
03:48:12,040 --> 03:48:16,040
I can't use this no point if you can do it so easily.

3778
03:48:16,040 --> 03:48:18,040
We're going to jump together.

3779
03:48:18,040 --> 03:48:19,040
You really swore?

3780
03:48:19,040 --> 03:48:20,040
Yes.

3781
03:48:20,040 --> 03:48:21,040
But where?

3782
03:48:21,040 --> 03:48:23,040
Right near here.

3783
03:48:29,040 --> 03:48:34,040
I can't see any witch up there, Snork. Just the moon up in the sky.

3784
03:48:43,040 --> 03:48:47,040
And she was really flying in the sky? Is that what Snork said?

3785
03:48:47,040 --> 03:48:50,040
Well, he should know about things that fly.

3786
03:48:50,040 --> 03:48:53,040
But I just can't believe it until I've seen it myself.

3787
03:48:53,040 --> 03:48:56,040
If she really is a witch, then what about the girl?

3788
03:48:56,040 --> 03:48:59,040
I mean, no one could be happy living with a witch.

3789
03:48:59,040 --> 03:49:02,040
I really don't know. I thought witches had to be old.

3790
03:49:02,040 --> 03:49:06,040
Maybe it's not her real grandmother. She could be adopted.

3791
03:49:06,040 --> 03:49:09,040
Well, moment, we must get to the bottom of this.

3792
03:49:09,040 --> 03:49:11,040
Yes, Snuffkin. We must.

3793
03:49:13,040 --> 03:49:14,040
Hmm.

3794
03:49:18,040 --> 03:49:21,040
Ha, I caught you at it again, you and your secret plan.

3795
03:49:21,040 --> 03:49:23,040
Where are you going?

3796
03:49:23,040 --> 03:49:25,040
Today you can't come with us with a little fly.

3797
03:49:25,040 --> 03:49:26,040
And why not?

3798
03:49:26,040 --> 03:49:28,040
Because we're going on a dangerous mission.

3799
03:49:28,040 --> 03:49:30,040
We're going to the forest of witches.

3800
03:49:30,040 --> 03:49:35,040
Well, if you're in any danger, then I must certainly come along to look after you, Moon.

3801
03:49:35,040 --> 03:49:36,040
Come on.

3802
03:49:38,040 --> 03:49:41,040
Besides, nothing's exciting to happen to me since I went up with that kite.

3803
03:49:42,040 --> 03:49:44,040
This is so exciting.

3804
03:49:44,040 --> 03:49:49,040
Ha, sleeping only through a set of four that I must cram in one adventure first.

3805
03:49:49,040 --> 03:49:52,040
This is what we'll do. I grabbed the witch and while she's helpless,

3806
03:49:52,040 --> 03:49:54,040
you two grabbed the girl and whisk her away to safety.

3807
03:49:54,040 --> 03:49:58,040
That sounds great, but we don't know if she is a witch, little Mai.

3808
03:49:58,040 --> 03:50:03,040
If we grab her and she isn't a witch, it would be embarrassing and we could all be in trouble.

3809
03:50:03,040 --> 03:50:08,040
Maybe the witch needed an innocent maiden to try out some potions to experiment on her.

3810
03:50:08,040 --> 03:50:10,040
Maybe, let's find out.

3811
03:50:10,040 --> 03:50:11,040
How do we find out?

3812
03:50:11,040 --> 03:50:13,040
By snooping around, I suppose.

3813
03:50:13,040 --> 03:50:17,040
I hope you'll think of something a bit better than that before we get there.

3814
03:50:17,040 --> 03:50:22,040
Let's hide as close to the house as we can and then ask the girl as soon as she comes out.

3815
03:50:23,040 --> 03:50:26,040
And what if she doesn't come out, Snuffkin?

3816
03:50:26,040 --> 03:50:28,040
Then we'll improvise, little Mai.

3817
03:50:28,040 --> 03:50:31,040
So this is the famous plan by the great Snuffkin.

3818
03:50:31,040 --> 03:50:36,040
Look, if she doesn't come out of the house, we'll just go up and knock on the door.

3819
03:50:37,040 --> 03:50:41,040
Once we're inside, I'm sure we'll be able to tell what's really what.

3820
03:50:41,040 --> 03:50:44,040
I don't think it's a very good idea.

3821
03:50:44,040 --> 03:50:46,040
What if she can't just spell on us?

3822
03:50:46,040 --> 03:50:51,040
Little Mai will wait outside and if we don't come out, she can run back to Moomin Valley for help.

3823
03:50:51,040 --> 03:50:55,040
That's fine, but Moomin can wait outside and I'll search the house.

3824
03:50:55,040 --> 03:50:58,040
Oh no, little Mai, you can wait outside and I will search the house.

3825
03:50:58,040 --> 03:51:00,040
Let's do it this way.

3826
03:51:00,040 --> 03:51:03,040
You stay outside and if we get caught, try to free us.

3827
03:51:03,040 --> 03:51:06,040
And run for help as quickly as you can only if you can't.

3828
03:51:06,040 --> 03:51:08,040
Is that okay?

3829
03:51:08,040 --> 03:51:11,040
Hmm, that means if you're in trouble, your lives will be in my hands.

3830
03:51:11,040 --> 03:51:13,040
That's right, little Mai.

3831
03:51:13,040 --> 03:51:17,040
I don't like this out of this. I'm not sure I want little Mai to be my last hope.

3832
03:51:17,040 --> 03:51:20,040
Well, I wouldn't help anyone who doesn't trust me, that's for sure.

3833
03:51:20,040 --> 03:51:22,040
Here's that? See what I mean?

3834
03:51:22,040 --> 03:51:25,040
Be quiet.

3835
03:51:25,040 --> 03:51:27,040
There's a house.

3836
03:51:27,040 --> 03:51:34,040
Look at this.

3837
03:51:34,040 --> 03:51:37,040
It's very quiet, do you think there's anybody home?

3838
03:51:37,040 --> 03:51:40,040
I don't know, let's wait a while and see.

3839
03:51:40,040 --> 03:51:43,040
Do we have to stay absolutely still?

3840
03:51:43,040 --> 03:51:48,040
But of course we do. We'll feel extremely silly if the house is empty.

3841
03:51:48,040 --> 03:51:52,040
They've disappeared. They could have told us where they were going.

3842
03:51:52,040 --> 03:51:55,040
I'm sure I don't care. Little Mai went too, I think.

3843
03:51:55,040 --> 03:51:58,040
She's betrayed us, that's just like her.

3844
03:51:58,040 --> 03:52:01,040
Don't worry, I've got a pretty good idea where they were heading for.

3845
03:52:01,040 --> 03:52:05,040
You know where they've gone? Why didn't you tell me? Where are they?

3846
03:52:05,040 --> 03:52:08,040
They've gone to the forest of witches.

3847
03:52:08,040 --> 03:52:09,040
What?

3848
03:52:09,040 --> 03:52:12,040
They've gone to see whether the woman we met yesterday is a real witch.

3849
03:52:12,040 --> 03:52:14,040
A real one?

3850
03:52:14,040 --> 03:52:19,040
Why don't we go there too? I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find my way, Sniff.

3851
03:52:19,040 --> 03:52:21,040
What is it?

3852
03:52:21,040 --> 03:52:24,040
I don't know, it's my stomach, I better lie down.

3853
03:52:24,040 --> 03:52:29,040
Oh, it's very painful.

3854
03:52:29,040 --> 03:52:33,040
Oh, how much longer we can have to stay here like this?

3855
03:52:33,040 --> 03:52:36,040
This adventure isn't the least bit exciting.

3856
03:52:36,040 --> 03:52:38,040
Well, let's wait a little bit longer. Be quiet.

3857
03:52:38,040 --> 03:52:40,040
At least we know the girl is definitely in there.

3858
03:52:40,040 --> 03:52:44,040
No, we don't. She might be out. She could be anywhere.

3859
03:52:44,040 --> 03:52:47,040
I know that's possible, but I don't think so.

3860
03:52:52,040 --> 03:52:54,040
She's getting some water.

3861
03:52:54,040 --> 03:52:57,040
As I thought, that way she's working her to the bone.

3862
03:52:57,040 --> 03:52:59,040
Hey, little boy.

3863
03:52:59,040 --> 03:53:01,040
She's following that girl.

3864
03:53:01,040 --> 03:53:04,040
You go with her, Moomin, and find out as much as you possibly can about what's going on.

3865
03:53:04,040 --> 03:53:06,040
I'll watch the house.

3866
03:53:06,040 --> 03:53:08,040
Right.

3867
03:53:09,040 --> 03:53:12,040
Hey, wait for me.

3868
03:53:22,040 --> 03:53:24,040
Oh.

3869
03:53:45,040 --> 03:53:47,040
Huh.

3870
03:53:51,040 --> 03:53:54,040
Oh.

3871
03:54:22,040 --> 03:54:26,040
If you're looking for Alicia, she's out.

3872
03:54:28,040 --> 03:54:33,040
Stop. Listen. Wait and see.

3873
03:54:33,040 --> 03:54:36,040
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

3874
03:54:36,040 --> 03:54:39,040
Why did you try to run away then?

3875
03:54:43,040 --> 03:54:46,040
Oh, I'll help you with that.

3876
03:54:46,040 --> 03:54:47,040
So will I.

3877
03:54:47,040 --> 03:54:50,040
How kind of you. It is a bit heavy to carry, you know.

3878
03:54:50,040 --> 03:54:52,040
I think I remember your name.

3879
03:54:52,040 --> 03:54:53,040
Is it Alicia?

3880
03:54:53,040 --> 03:54:56,040
Yes, it is. I'm so glad you remembered it.

3881
03:54:56,040 --> 03:54:57,040
My name is Moomin.

3882
03:54:57,040 --> 03:54:58,040
And I'm a little mind.

3883
03:54:58,040 --> 03:55:00,040
What are you doing here in the forest of witches?

3884
03:55:00,040 --> 03:55:05,040
Well, to be perfectly honest, we came because we were rather worried about you.

3885
03:55:05,040 --> 03:55:07,040
What about me? Why is that?

3886
03:55:07,040 --> 03:55:10,040
Is that a woman really your grandmother?

3887
03:55:10,040 --> 03:55:11,040
Of course.

3888
03:55:11,040 --> 03:55:12,040
You're quite sure?

3889
03:55:12,040 --> 03:55:15,040
Yes, of course. She's my mother's mother. Why do you ask?

3890
03:55:15,040 --> 03:55:17,040
Well, don't you know?

3891
03:55:18,040 --> 03:55:20,040
He's trying to ask.

3892
03:55:20,040 --> 03:55:23,040
Well, maybe your grandmother is a witch.

3893
03:55:23,040 --> 03:55:25,040
Yes, she is.

3894
03:55:25,040 --> 03:55:26,040
Of course.

3895
03:55:26,040 --> 03:55:29,040
Oh, I'm sorry. I was a bit taken aback.

3896
03:55:29,040 --> 03:55:32,040
You don't mind about your grandmother being a real witch?

3897
03:55:32,040 --> 03:55:34,040
Oh, no. That's what she is.

3898
03:55:34,040 --> 03:55:38,040
I was husband. I'm going to be one, two, and I'm grown up.

3899
03:55:38,040 --> 03:55:42,040
Oh, no. You couldn't. Well, you don't look anything like one.

3900
03:55:42,040 --> 03:55:44,040
Well, that's because I'm not one yet.

3901
03:55:44,040 --> 03:55:47,040
When you're born into a witch family, that's what you become.

3902
03:55:47,040 --> 03:55:49,040
But it's not that easy, you know.

3903
03:55:49,040 --> 03:55:51,040
Oh, this is too much.

3904
03:55:51,040 --> 03:55:55,040
Now, tell me, what are you doing here in the forest of witches?

3905
03:55:55,040 --> 03:55:57,040
You don't sound like a witch.

3906
03:55:57,040 --> 03:55:59,040
Oh, really? What do witches sound like?

3907
03:55:59,040 --> 03:56:02,040
Well, to be honest, you're the first one I've ever met in my whole life.

3908
03:56:02,040 --> 03:56:05,040
I'm sure that's just what you think, young man.

3909
03:56:05,040 --> 03:56:08,040
Is it true that the nice girl is really your granddaughter?

3910
03:56:08,040 --> 03:56:11,040
Certainly. A very promising young girl.

3911
03:56:11,040 --> 03:56:14,040
Honest and hardworking, and with a lot of training,

3912
03:56:14,040 --> 03:56:16,040
she will make an excellent witch someday.

3913
03:56:16,040 --> 03:56:19,040
But how can you possibly turn such a sweet girl into a witch?

3914
03:56:19,040 --> 03:56:21,040
The sweetest girls make the best witches.

3915
03:56:21,040 --> 03:56:24,040
Hello, didn't know you were back, grandma.

3916
03:56:24,040 --> 03:56:26,040
Thank you for getting the water, Alicia.

3917
03:56:26,040 --> 03:56:28,040
Oh, who's that?

3918
03:56:28,040 --> 03:56:33,040
I don't know. Some naive young man out to rescue a damsel in distress now.

3919
03:56:33,040 --> 03:56:35,040
I remember you, your snuffkin.

3920
03:56:35,040 --> 03:56:37,040
Yes.

3921
03:56:38,040 --> 03:56:42,040
Your friend snuffkins in here, why don't you come in, too?

3922
03:56:42,040 --> 03:56:44,040
In the house? Really?

3923
03:56:44,040 --> 03:56:46,040
He's brought friends with him, Addy.

3924
03:56:46,040 --> 03:56:49,040
Self-killed. Whatever they're done to you.

3925
03:56:49,040 --> 03:56:51,040
I'll take care of that.

3926
03:56:51,040 --> 03:56:54,040
Wait a second. I'll do it for you.

3927
03:56:54,040 --> 03:56:55,040
I'll fix it.

3928
03:57:01,040 --> 03:57:03,040
Wait. I'm gonna need you again.

3929
03:57:03,040 --> 03:57:04,040
Where'd you go in?

3930
03:57:04,040 --> 03:57:07,040
I don't think that snake ever got bitten before.

3931
03:57:07,040 --> 03:57:09,040
I'll get another.

3932
03:57:09,040 --> 03:57:12,040
I'm very curious. Why are you three here, huh?

3933
03:57:12,040 --> 03:57:14,040
They came all the way from Moomin Valley

3934
03:57:14,040 --> 03:57:16,040
because they were really worried about me, grandma.

3935
03:57:16,040 --> 03:57:18,040
Worried about you?

3936
03:57:18,040 --> 03:57:20,040
Yes. They thought you might be nasty to me

3937
03:57:20,040 --> 03:57:23,040
so they came all this way to see if I needed help.

3938
03:57:23,040 --> 03:57:25,040
This always happens.

3939
03:57:25,040 --> 03:57:27,040
People treat witches as if they weren't ordinary,

3940
03:57:27,040 --> 03:57:30,040
respectable, responsible citizens.

3941
03:57:30,040 --> 03:57:32,040
No, no. We're very sorry.

3942
03:57:32,040 --> 03:57:34,040
We realize she's quite okay

3943
03:57:34,040 --> 03:57:37,040
and she's most welcome to visit us in Moomin Valley

3944
03:57:37,040 --> 03:57:39,040
at any time, isn't she, Snuffkin?

3945
03:57:39,040 --> 03:57:41,040
Yes, certainly.

3946
03:57:41,040 --> 03:57:44,040
What? You said you'd visit these people?

3947
03:57:44,040 --> 03:57:46,040
Oh, yes. I thought I'd go over there sometimes

3948
03:57:46,040 --> 03:57:49,040
after I finished with my homework, of course.

3949
03:57:49,040 --> 03:57:51,040
I would never leave my studies half done.

3950
03:57:51,040 --> 03:57:55,040
Sorry, Alicia, but if you ever want to become a good witch,

3951
03:57:55,040 --> 03:57:58,040
you mustn't see any ordinary mortals.

3952
03:57:58,040 --> 03:57:59,040
Oh, why not?

3953
03:57:59,040 --> 03:58:02,040
I've only just become friends with them, grandma, please.

3954
03:58:02,040 --> 03:58:04,040
I know. Why don't I wait a year

3955
03:58:04,040 --> 03:58:07,040
and study to be a witch next year?

3956
03:58:07,040 --> 03:58:09,040
Alicia.

3957
03:58:11,040 --> 03:58:13,040
This is family business.

3958
03:58:13,040 --> 03:58:15,040
So if you don't mind, I would appreciate it

3959
03:58:15,040 --> 03:58:17,040
if you were to leave.

3960
03:58:17,040 --> 03:58:20,040
And I'd like you to go immediately if you please.

3961
03:58:30,040 --> 03:58:33,040
It's snowing.

3962
03:58:33,040 --> 03:58:36,040
Well, she certainly won't be able to visit us

3963
03:58:36,040 --> 03:58:38,040
at Moomin Valley is buried in snow,

3964
03:58:38,040 --> 03:58:40,040
so we might never see her again.

3965
03:58:40,040 --> 03:58:42,040
No, that's right.

3966
03:58:42,040 --> 03:58:46,040
And you'll be leaving soon, won't you, Snuffkin?

3967
03:58:46,040 --> 03:58:50,040
Winter had come once again to Moomin Valley.

3968
03:58:59,040 --> 03:59:09,040
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

3969
03:59:09,040 --> 03:59:16,040
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

3970
03:59:16,040 --> 03:59:20,040
They're always happy and goes at play.

3971
03:59:20,040 --> 03:59:24,040
The Moons are having fun day after day.

3972
03:59:24,040 --> 03:59:27,040
The Moons.

3973
03:59:27,040 --> 03:59:31,040
The Moons.

3974
03:59:31,040 --> 03:59:37,040
The Moons.

3975
03:59:58,040 --> 04:00:02,040
Here they are for one and all.

3976
04:00:02,040 --> 04:00:05,040
The Moomins are about to call.

3977
04:00:05,040 --> 04:00:08,040
Come on and sit down here with me.

3978
04:00:08,040 --> 04:00:11,040
They're here for you on your TV.

3979
04:00:11,040 --> 04:00:14,040
They are the movements.

3980
04:00:14,040 --> 04:00:17,040
They are the movements.

3981
04:00:17,040 --> 04:00:20,040
So come with me, give me your hand.

3982
04:00:20,040 --> 04:00:23,040
I'll take you up to Moomin Land.

3983
04:00:23,040 --> 04:00:26,040
You can fly just like a bird.

3984
04:00:26,040 --> 04:00:28,040
Sing thepass song ever.

3985
04:00:28,040 --> 04:00:31,040
There were the movements.

3986
04:00:31,040 --> 04:00:34,040
There were the movements.

3987
04:00:34,040 --> 04:00:37,040
There were the movements.

3988
04:00:37,040 --> 04:00:40,040
There was the movement.

3989
04:00:40,040 --> 04:00:43,040
There were the movements.

3990
04:00:43,040 --> 04:00:47,040
There were the movements.

3991
04:00:48,040 --> 04:00:52,040
The snow was getting thicker on the ground.

3992
04:00:52,040 --> 04:00:56,040
and it was high time for the movements to start hibernating.

3993
04:01:17,040 --> 04:01:21,040
What are you doing, new man? Alicia? What do you do with these pine needles?

3994
04:01:22,040 --> 04:01:26,040
That's what we always eat before we hibernate. Nobody knows why.

3995
04:01:26,040 --> 04:01:28,040
So you're going to start hibernating?

3996
04:01:28,040 --> 04:01:29,040
Yes, tonight.

3997
04:01:29,040 --> 04:01:31,040
Oh, that's soon?

3998
04:01:31,040 --> 04:01:32,040
Yes.

3999
04:01:32,040 --> 04:01:36,040
I'm so glad I've come to see you today instead of leaving until tomorrow then.

4000
04:01:37,040 --> 04:01:40,040
I must say you came on just the right day, Alicia.

4001
04:01:40,040 --> 04:01:45,040
We usually have a small party the night we start hibernating and you've arrived just in time.

4002
04:01:45,040 --> 04:01:48,040
Oh, you mean I can stay for that woman, Mama?

4003
04:01:49,040 --> 04:01:55,040
And by the way, Alicia is a matter of interest as to which, sorry, your grandmother, I mean, know that you're here?

4004
04:01:55,040 --> 04:01:59,040
No, I'm afraid I didn't tell her. Better for grown-ups not to know too much.

4005
04:01:59,040 --> 04:02:01,040
Oh, do you say you're right?

4006
04:02:01,040 --> 04:02:04,040
I'm afraid she's not very happy for me to come here to Moomin Valley.

4007
04:02:04,040 --> 04:02:06,040
Why ever not my dear?

4008
04:02:06,040 --> 04:02:11,040
I guess she's afraid that if I start coming here to play, I shall lose interest in studying hard at my witchcraft.

4009
04:02:11,040 --> 04:02:15,040
Oh, but you've got a very long time to go before you're a witch?

4010
04:02:15,040 --> 04:02:19,040
It takes anything between five to seven years nowadays.

4011
04:02:19,040 --> 04:02:22,040
Are you really sure that's what you want to be, Alicia?

4012
04:02:22,040 --> 04:02:23,040
Study something out.

4013
04:02:23,040 --> 04:02:25,040
But I want to be a witch.

4014
04:02:25,040 --> 04:02:28,040
Perhaps you don't know, but witches aren't terribly popular.

4015
04:02:28,040 --> 04:02:32,040
Yes, I do, but I won't be like that. I'll be popular.

4016
04:02:34,040 --> 04:02:37,040
Hey, Snuffkin!

4017
04:02:39,040 --> 04:02:41,040
You're off to the moments?

4018
04:02:41,040 --> 04:02:42,040
Yes.

4019
04:02:43,040 --> 04:02:45,040
I thought you'd gone south already.

4020
04:02:45,040 --> 04:02:48,040
Last winter you'd gone before the snow started.

4021
04:02:48,040 --> 04:02:50,040
Not this year, I promised Moomin.

4022
04:02:50,040 --> 04:02:51,040
Promise?

4023
04:02:51,040 --> 04:02:54,040
I promised not to leave Moomin Valley until he went into hibernation.

4024
04:02:59,040 --> 04:03:02,040
Everybody seems to be here, and somebody new.

4025
04:03:02,040 --> 04:03:03,040
Who's that?

4026
04:03:03,040 --> 04:03:05,040
Have a guess.

4027
04:03:05,040 --> 04:03:08,040
Very well, then. It's Alicia, that's my guess.

4028
04:03:08,040 --> 04:03:10,040
How did you know?

4029
04:03:10,040 --> 04:03:12,040
What? I'm right?

4030
04:03:12,040 --> 04:03:15,040
Yes, you are, but I think you peaked and saw her earlier on.

4031
04:03:15,040 --> 04:03:19,040
I did it. I just named somebody I thought couldn't be here.

4032
04:03:19,040 --> 04:03:20,040
Clever, huh?

4033
04:03:20,040 --> 04:03:24,040
Well, she just happened to stop by. She's with Papa, who's showing her around the house.

4034
04:03:24,040 --> 04:03:26,040
Is the witch here, too?

4035
04:03:26,040 --> 04:03:29,040
No, she didn't tell the witch she was coming here.

4036
04:03:29,040 --> 04:03:31,040
Just as well. Thank goodness.

4037
04:03:34,040 --> 04:03:39,040
Ah, it's you, Snuffkin. I finally came over. I told you I would.

4038
04:03:39,040 --> 04:03:40,040
Hi.

4039
04:03:40,040 --> 04:03:43,040
Remember our friend here? He's called Sniff.

4040
04:03:43,040 --> 04:03:45,040
Hi. How do you do Sniff?

4041
04:03:45,040 --> 04:03:50,040
Well, you aren't going to use your magic to cast any spells and stuff, are you?

4042
04:03:50,040 --> 04:03:52,040
No.

4043
04:03:57,040 --> 04:04:01,040
Actually, they didn't need just pine needles for dinner that evening.

4044
04:04:01,040 --> 04:04:05,040
They had lots of other nice things, too. All cooked by Moomin Mama.

4045
04:04:05,040 --> 04:04:08,040
Snuffkin, I'd like to say how story I am.

4046
04:04:08,040 --> 04:04:09,040
Why?

4047
04:04:09,040 --> 04:04:13,040
I persuaded you to stay on here instead of going south as you'd planned.

4048
04:04:13,040 --> 04:04:15,040
I'm leaving tomorrow.

4049
04:04:15,040 --> 04:04:17,040
But the snow is quite deep.

4050
04:04:17,040 --> 04:04:20,040
Don't worry, I'm used to deep snow.

4051
04:04:20,040 --> 04:04:23,040
I'm just worried Alicia will find it hard to get home in this.

4052
04:04:23,040 --> 04:04:28,040
Well, she could spell the night here, but of course tomorrow will be asleep for the winter, so...

4053
04:04:32,040 --> 04:04:33,040
Huh?

4054
04:04:33,040 --> 04:04:35,040
Hmm? Someone's at the door.

4055
04:04:35,040 --> 04:04:37,040
I'll see who it is.

4056
04:04:38,040 --> 04:04:45,040
Oh, hello. How are you?

4057
04:04:45,040 --> 04:04:51,040
Hello indeed, my young man. My granddaughter is here, isn't she?

4058
04:04:51,040 --> 04:04:54,040
Who is it then, Moomin?

4059
04:04:54,040 --> 04:04:56,040
Oh, my dear.

4060
04:04:56,040 --> 04:04:58,040
You must be Moomin Papa.

4061
04:05:02,040 --> 04:05:04,040
Now, you listen to me, Moomin Papa.

4062
04:05:04,040 --> 04:05:08,040
I don't want my granddaughter playing with your children under any circumstances.

4063
04:05:08,040 --> 04:05:10,040
Do I make myself quite clear?

4064
04:05:10,040 --> 04:05:12,040
But Alicia likes playing with us.

4065
04:05:12,040 --> 04:05:13,040
Grandma!

4066
04:05:13,040 --> 04:05:16,040
We're leaving. Can't I stay a little longer?

4067
04:05:16,040 --> 04:05:19,040
Hello, you're most welcome to stay and have dinner with us.

4068
04:05:19,040 --> 04:05:23,040
Don't you know I'm a witch? I can't eat that sort of baby food.

4069
04:05:23,040 --> 04:05:25,040
Alicia quite likes the food.

4070
04:05:25,040 --> 04:05:29,040
The pine needles look okay. The rest is yucky. Come, Alicia.

4071
04:05:29,040 --> 04:05:31,040
Please let me stay, Grandma.

4072
04:05:32,040 --> 04:05:35,040
I've told you before, which is never mixed with people like this,

4073
04:05:35,040 --> 04:05:37,040
and that goes for novice, which is as well.

4074
04:05:37,040 --> 04:05:38,040
Never.

4075
04:05:38,040 --> 04:05:40,040
With their knives, they're really all, Grandma.

4076
04:05:40,040 --> 04:05:42,040
And I told you, that's the trouble.

4077
04:05:42,040 --> 04:05:45,040
They are disgustingly, signally good.

4078
04:05:46,040 --> 04:05:49,040
You will hear a lot more about this when we get home.

4079
04:05:49,040 --> 04:05:51,040
Come on now.

4080
04:05:51,040 --> 04:05:55,040
It's really cold out here, and there's a lot more snow on the way.

4081
04:05:56,040 --> 04:05:58,040
All right, I'm coming, Grandma.

4082
04:05:58,040 --> 04:05:59,040
Coming.

4083
04:05:59,040 --> 04:06:01,040
Oh, thank you.

4084
04:06:01,040 --> 04:06:02,040
Mum and Papa.

4085
04:06:02,040 --> 04:06:03,040
Yeah?

4086
04:06:03,040 --> 04:06:05,040
We understand each other now, don't we?

4087
04:06:05,040 --> 04:06:07,040
I'm sure you understand me.

4088
04:06:07,040 --> 04:06:09,040
Never mind about that.

4089
04:06:09,040 --> 04:06:12,040
You and your whole family are never to speak to my granddaughter again.

4090
04:06:12,040 --> 04:06:14,040
Is that understood?

4091
04:06:14,040 --> 04:06:16,040
But Grandma!

4092
04:06:16,040 --> 04:06:19,040
Mind what I say over a vengeance of touch will come upon you,

4093
04:06:19,040 --> 04:06:21,040
or even the revenge of a serious.

4094
04:06:21,040 --> 04:06:24,040
If you think cheap threats like that impress Mum and Papa,

4095
04:06:24,040 --> 04:06:26,040
you're making a grave mistake.

4096
04:06:26,040 --> 04:06:29,040
Mum and Papa is a highly educated gentleman.

4097
04:06:29,040 --> 04:06:32,040
But I am a witch with three diplomas.

4098
04:06:32,040 --> 04:06:33,040
Maybe so.

4099
04:06:33,040 --> 04:06:37,040
But tell me, how can three diplomas help you to get home with all this snow?

4100
04:06:37,040 --> 04:06:40,040
Ha! Child's play to an accredited witch.

4101
04:06:40,040 --> 04:06:42,040
Come, Alicia.

4102
04:06:44,040 --> 04:06:47,040
I've never seen one of these before, a little pep square.

4103
04:06:48,040 --> 04:06:50,040
Is that really a witch's broom?

4104
04:06:50,040 --> 04:06:51,040
Well, I never.

4105
04:06:51,040 --> 04:06:53,040
Let's go and see.

4106
04:06:57,040 --> 04:06:58,040
I'm ready!

4107
04:06:58,040 --> 04:06:59,040
Hold on tight, Alicia.

4108
04:06:59,040 --> 04:07:00,040
Okay.

4109
04:07:00,040 --> 04:07:03,040
Can you both ride on that broom?

4110
04:07:03,040 --> 04:07:05,040
It looks pretty scrappy to me.

4111
04:07:05,040 --> 04:07:07,040
Could fall to pieces any minute.

4112
04:07:07,040 --> 04:07:09,040
Do drive slowly in this weather.

4113
04:07:09,040 --> 04:07:12,040
Oh, please don't fall off, Alicia.

4114
04:07:12,040 --> 04:07:14,040
But terrible chatterboxes you all are.

4115
04:07:14,040 --> 04:07:17,040
Please keep quiet out of you.

4116
04:07:17,040 --> 04:07:19,040
Are you ready, girl?

4117
04:07:19,040 --> 04:07:20,040
Yeah?

4118
04:07:20,040 --> 04:07:22,040
Bet they'll never be able to take off.

4119
04:07:22,040 --> 04:07:23,040
Huh?

4120
04:07:23,040 --> 04:07:24,040
Ha!

4121
04:07:24,040 --> 04:07:26,040
Ha!

4122
04:07:46,040 --> 04:07:47,040
What is it, Grandma?

4123
04:07:47,040 --> 04:07:48,040
Nothing.

4124
04:07:48,040 --> 04:07:49,040
Oh!

4125
04:07:52,040 --> 04:07:54,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4126
04:07:54,040 --> 04:07:56,040
Just what I thought, they're too heavy.

4127
04:07:56,040 --> 04:08:00,040
Listen, I could take Alicia's place, I'm not too heavy.

4128
04:08:00,040 --> 04:08:03,040
Don't worry, I'm happy to walk home, Grandma.

4129
04:08:03,040 --> 04:08:05,040
Don't be so ridiculous, child.

4130
04:08:05,040 --> 04:08:07,040
You can't walk home in all this snow.

4131
04:08:07,040 --> 04:08:08,040
You'll never make it.

4132
04:08:08,040 --> 04:08:09,040
Only I had some skis.

4133
04:08:09,040 --> 04:08:11,040
Come on, climb aboard.

4134
04:08:11,040 --> 04:08:13,040
I'll try another spell.

4135
04:08:13,040 --> 04:08:16,040
Grandma, are you worried because all those people are watching you?

4136
04:08:16,040 --> 04:08:17,040
Shut up!

4137
04:08:17,040 --> 04:08:19,040
I help you say the magic spell.

4138
04:08:19,040 --> 04:08:20,040
Ah!

4139
04:08:20,040 --> 04:08:21,040
Ah!

4140
04:08:21,040 --> 04:08:22,040
Oh, hi!

4141
04:08:22,040 --> 04:08:23,040
Oh!

4142
04:08:23,040 --> 04:08:24,040
Oh!

4143
04:08:24,040 --> 04:08:25,040
Oh!

4144
04:08:25,040 --> 04:08:26,040
Oh!

4145
04:08:26,040 --> 04:08:27,040
Oh!

4146
04:08:27,040 --> 04:08:28,040
Oh!

4147
04:08:28,040 --> 04:08:29,040
Oh!

4148
04:08:29,040 --> 04:08:30,040
Oh!

4149
04:08:30,040 --> 04:08:31,040
Oh!

4150
04:08:31,040 --> 04:08:32,040
Oh!

4151
04:08:32,040 --> 04:08:34,040
They're doing it!

4152
04:08:34,040 --> 04:08:35,040
Oh!

4153
04:08:35,040 --> 04:08:36,040
Oh!

4154
04:08:36,040 --> 04:08:37,040
Oh!

4155
04:08:37,040 --> 04:08:38,040
What?

4156
04:08:38,040 --> 04:08:39,040
Oh!

4157
04:08:39,040 --> 04:08:40,040
Oh!

4158
04:08:40,040 --> 04:08:41,040
Oh!

4159
04:08:41,040 --> 04:08:42,040
Oh!

4160
04:08:42,040 --> 04:08:43,040
Oh!

4161
04:08:43,040 --> 04:08:44,040
Oh!

4162
04:08:44,040 --> 04:08:45,040
Oh!

4163
04:08:45,040 --> 04:08:46,040
Oh!

4164
04:08:46,040 --> 04:08:47,040
Oh!

4165
04:08:47,040 --> 04:08:49,040
Oh!

4166
04:08:49,040 --> 04:08:50,540
Where are we going?

4167
04:08:50,540 --> 04:08:51,540
Oh!

4168
04:08:51,540 --> 04:08:52,540
Ah!

4169
04:08:52,540 --> 04:08:53,540
Oh!

4170
04:08:53,540 --> 04:08:54,540
Oh!

4171
04:08:54,540 --> 04:08:55,540
Oh!

4172
04:08:55,540 --> 04:08:56,540
Oh!

4173
04:08:59,540 --> 04:09:00,540
Oh!

4174
04:09:00,540 --> 04:09:01,540
Oh!

4175
04:09:01,540 --> 04:09:02,540
Wow!

4176
04:09:02,540 --> 04:09:03,540
One!

4177
04:09:03,540 --> 04:09:04,540
Will you marry everybody goodbye?

4178
04:09:04,540 --> 04:09:05,540
Wow!

4179
04:09:05,540 --> 04:09:06,540
Oh!

4180
04:09:06,540 --> 04:09:07,540
Wow!

4181
04:09:07,540 --> 04:09:08,540
That's a z fix!

4182
04:09:08,540 --> 04:09:12,540
She may have three diplomas, but I don't think she's very good, Mama.

4183
04:09:12,540 --> 04:09:17,780
But I don't think she's very good mama. I wish they'd sing to the ground so I could fly that room

4184
04:09:17,980 --> 04:09:21,740
Guess they're all right now, woman papa. Let's go back to our dinner

4185
04:09:30,740 --> 04:09:34,300
Oh, I forgot to thank them for asking me to stand a dinner

4186
04:09:34,780 --> 04:09:40,640
Thank them indeed. I don't think you're cut out to be a witch over grandma. I don't want to be one

4187
04:09:40,640 --> 04:09:44,520
Well, I'm quite happy to help with the path will certainly be a difficult one

4188
04:10:10,640 --> 04:10:30,080
With Alessia and the witch gone home to the Valley of the Witches Snuffkin departed for his trip south and the Moomins went into hibernation

4189
04:10:41,480 --> 04:10:49,280
They certainly would have slept till the beginning of the spring is usual, but this year

4190
04:10:58,240 --> 04:11:01,040
Quite unexpectedly something happened

4191
04:11:10,640 --> 04:11:12,640
Oh

4192
04:11:41,640 --> 04:11:43,640
Oh

4193
04:11:49,920 --> 04:11:51,920
Spring here already

4194
04:11:57,240 --> 04:11:59,240
There's someone at the window

4195
04:12:00,080 --> 04:12:02,080
Oh

4196
04:12:08,120 --> 04:12:10,120
It's frozen shut

4197
04:12:19,640 --> 04:12:26,200
Hey, why did you wake me up? Well, you shouldn't be asleep. Didn't you know Christmas is coming?

4198
04:12:26,480 --> 04:12:29,080
It's tomorrow, so there's not a minute to be lost

4199
04:12:29,880 --> 04:12:33,000
Christmas is coming tomorrow, but who on earth is that?

4200
04:12:33,560 --> 04:12:39,000
Why who is Christmas? This isn't a joke moment. I'm not in the least ready

4201
04:12:39,000 --> 04:12:45,920
I've lost my mittens and Christmas is coming and I haven't got a firtry yet a firtry. I really must get a firtry

4202
04:12:49,240 --> 04:12:52,280
How very odd why a firtry

4203
04:12:53,240 --> 04:12:55,240
Hey

4204
04:12:55,240 --> 04:12:57,240
Why

4205
04:13:01,240 --> 04:13:05,520
Well Christmas is almost coming and we don't have a firtry yet Christmas

4206
04:13:06,640 --> 04:13:13,800
Hmm. Did you say Christmas is coming? Yes, and before that, why must have a firtry? What's this about a firtry?

4207
04:13:14,320 --> 04:13:20,600
We need one to protect ourselves against this Christmas person moment mama. I am not really quite clear on that point

4208
04:13:20,600 --> 04:13:23,440
But there's something awful that has to be kept away, right?

4209
04:13:26,200 --> 04:13:28,200
I better go get a firtry

4210
04:13:42,920 --> 04:13:48,920
Ha about the time you movements got up. How are you, Gafsey? Pretty good firtry, Dad

4211
04:13:49,640 --> 04:13:51,640
Oh

4212
04:13:51,640 --> 04:13:55,840
Thank you, Gafsey, but could you tell me something and what is one supposed to do with it?

4213
04:13:59,120 --> 04:14:03,580
Really moving papa the way you can joke with such a straight face

4214
04:14:04,320 --> 04:14:09,200
Joke hey love to stay, but I haven't even finished cooking yet

4215
04:14:12,880 --> 04:14:15,480
Wasn't joking no one believe me either

4216
04:14:18,920 --> 04:14:22,920
Would you like a little more, young man?

4217
04:14:22,920 --> 04:14:26,920
No, thank you very much. I'm really nice and warm again now.

4218
04:14:26,920 --> 04:14:30,920
I saw Moan Papa and Moan bring up a big tree!

4219
04:14:30,920 --> 04:14:32,920
But what is one supposed to do with it?

4220
04:14:32,920 --> 04:14:34,920
Don't you know? No.

4221
04:14:34,920 --> 04:14:38,920
Why, you decorate it as beautifully as you can.

4222
04:14:38,920 --> 04:14:40,920
Really?

4223
04:14:43,920 --> 04:14:46,920
Christmas is coming, so I better be off.

4224
04:14:46,920 --> 04:14:48,920
Everyone's talking of Christmas.

4225
04:14:48,920 --> 04:14:50,920
By now, I've got a long way to go.

4226
04:14:52,920 --> 04:14:54,920
Take care, dear.

4227
04:15:00,920 --> 04:15:02,920
Hello.

4228
04:15:02,920 --> 04:15:04,920
Hello.

4229
04:15:06,920 --> 04:15:08,920
Bye-bye!

4230
04:15:08,920 --> 04:15:10,920
Bye-bye!

4231
04:15:12,920 --> 04:15:14,920
Who was that?

4232
04:15:14,920 --> 04:15:18,920
He was in a hurry to get somewhere before Christmas, so I gave him some tea.

4233
04:15:18,920 --> 04:15:20,920
Well, that was nice.

4234
04:15:20,920 --> 04:15:22,920
And he told us what to do with the fir tree.

4235
04:15:22,920 --> 04:15:24,920
What did he say?

4236
04:15:24,920 --> 04:15:26,920
To decorate it beautifully.

4237
04:15:26,920 --> 04:15:28,920
Decorate it, but why should we do that, Moan?

4238
04:15:28,920 --> 04:15:32,920
I guess we must decorate the tree to make sure we keep Christmas happy.

4239
04:15:32,920 --> 04:15:34,920
Yes, you're right.

4240
04:15:34,920 --> 04:15:36,920
We'd better start doing it right away.

4241
04:15:36,920 --> 04:15:38,920
Yes, I'm sure there's not a moment to lose.

4242
04:15:38,920 --> 04:15:40,920
No.

4243
04:15:40,920 --> 04:15:42,920
Yes, dear.

4244
04:15:42,920 --> 04:15:44,920
They also say we have to cook lots of food for Christmas.

4245
04:15:44,920 --> 04:15:46,920
Goodness.

4246
04:15:46,920 --> 04:15:48,920
Well, at least he won't be eating us then.

4247
04:15:58,920 --> 04:16:00,920
Here.

4248
04:16:00,920 --> 04:16:02,920
Thank you, Snorkmaid.

4249
04:16:02,920 --> 04:16:04,920
The ship means rather a lot to me.

4250
04:16:04,920 --> 04:16:06,920
It will look fantastic on the tree, Papa.

4251
04:16:06,920 --> 04:16:08,920
Yes, dear. I suppose you're right.

4252
04:16:10,920 --> 04:16:20,920
Oh, why don't we put this at the top?

4253
04:16:20,920 --> 04:16:22,920
This is Mars.

4254
04:16:22,920 --> 04:16:26,920
Don't worry.

4255
04:16:26,920 --> 04:16:30,920
That looks beautiful.

4256
04:16:30,920 --> 04:16:32,920
Listen, everybody.

4257
04:16:32,920 --> 04:16:36,920
I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas too.

4258
04:16:36,920 --> 04:16:38,920
Really, Mama?

4259
04:16:38,920 --> 04:16:42,920
I don't wonder what this Christmas will be like.

4260
04:16:42,920 --> 04:16:46,920
What if it's an awful greedy, beastly monster like the grove?

4261
04:16:46,920 --> 04:16:48,920
Don't worry, Snorkmaid.

4262
04:16:48,920 --> 04:16:52,920
We'll give him lots of presents and stuff him full of food.

4263
04:16:54,920 --> 04:16:58,920
Have you thought of any presents for Christmas yet?

4264
04:16:58,920 --> 04:17:00,920
I don't know what to give him.

4265
04:17:00,920 --> 04:17:02,920
Look, a seashell.

4266
04:17:02,920 --> 04:17:06,920
Oh, that's a beauty.

4267
04:17:07,920 --> 04:17:10,920
Oh, look, Mama, what I got for Christmas.

4268
04:17:10,920 --> 04:17:13,920
I'm going to give him a pretty lure for fishing.

4269
04:17:13,920 --> 04:17:15,920
I'm giving him this book.

4270
04:17:15,920 --> 04:17:22,920
Great presents. I'm sure he'll be very happy with the moment family and not Thomas at all.

4271
04:17:30,920 --> 04:17:33,920
I think Christmas will come any moment now.

4272
04:17:33,920 --> 04:17:35,920
So do I.

4273
04:17:35,920 --> 04:17:39,920
Oh, dear. I do hope he likes my pumpkin pie.

4274
04:17:39,920 --> 04:17:41,920
He will.

4275
04:17:41,920 --> 04:17:45,920
Imagine everyone in Moomin Valley being frightened.

4276
04:17:53,920 --> 04:17:55,920
Are you sleepy?

4277
04:17:55,920 --> 04:17:57,920
Yes, I am.

4278
04:17:57,920 --> 04:17:59,920
I can't stay this scared for much longer.

4279
04:17:59,920 --> 04:18:03,920
Better come before all the food freezes.

4280
04:18:03,920 --> 04:18:09,920
Oh, he's coming.

4281
04:18:11,920 --> 04:18:15,920
I never thought Christmas could be that small.

4282
04:18:15,920 --> 04:18:17,920
Merry Christmas.

4283
04:18:17,920 --> 04:18:20,920
Merry Christmas. Is that what he is?

4284
04:18:20,920 --> 04:18:22,920
Well, it's just what you say.

4285
04:18:22,920 --> 04:18:26,920
All of my life I have dreamed of seeing all this up close, honestly.

4286
04:18:26,920 --> 04:18:30,920
I never really thought a Christmas tree could be this beautiful.

4287
04:18:30,920 --> 04:18:32,920
Brought my friends, too.

4288
04:18:32,920 --> 04:18:34,920
You're all very welcome.

4289
04:18:34,920 --> 04:18:37,920
Oh, thank you. Hear that, everybody.

4290
04:18:37,920 --> 04:18:39,920
We're all very welcome.

4291
04:18:39,920 --> 04:18:41,920
Oh, man, let's get them.

4292
04:18:41,920 --> 04:18:43,920
There's some wonderful things here.

4293
04:18:45,920 --> 04:18:48,920
Oh, what a lot of food you've made.

4294
04:18:48,920 --> 04:18:50,920
Yes, all the food there is for Christmas.

4295
04:18:50,920 --> 04:18:53,920
And are those real presents?

4296
04:18:53,920 --> 04:18:55,920
They are.

4297
04:18:55,920 --> 04:18:59,920
All of my life, I've sort of wondered about those things called presents.

4298
04:18:59,920 --> 04:19:02,920
Papa, I don't think these creatures are Christmas.

4299
04:19:02,920 --> 04:19:05,920
Neither do I.

4300
04:19:12,920 --> 04:19:14,920
You look sleepy, Mama.

4301
04:19:14,920 --> 04:19:18,920
I am. Must be well past midnight.

4302
04:19:18,920 --> 04:19:21,920
What is Christmas doing, Mama?

4303
04:19:21,920 --> 04:19:23,920
Aren't you sleepy, two little ones?

4304
04:19:23,920 --> 04:19:28,920
Sleepy with a wonderful Christmas tree like this to look at?

4305
04:19:30,920 --> 04:19:31,920
Hey, Papa.

4306
04:19:31,920 --> 04:19:32,920
What is it?

4307
04:19:32,920 --> 04:19:35,920
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

4308
04:19:35,920 --> 04:19:38,920
Maybe.

4309
04:19:38,920 --> 04:19:41,920
Nobody can get really angry this late at night.

4310
04:19:41,920 --> 04:19:45,920
Surely we'll close the doors and perhaps we'll be safe inside.

4311
04:19:45,920 --> 04:19:47,920
I'm sure you're right.

4312
04:19:47,920 --> 04:19:51,920
Listen, my friends, we'd like to give you the tree and the food and the presents.

4313
04:19:51,920 --> 04:19:54,920
What? All of this?

4314
04:19:54,920 --> 04:19:55,920
For us?

4315
04:19:55,920 --> 04:19:57,920
Yes, we want to sleep.

4316
04:19:57,920 --> 04:19:59,920
We're far more sleepy than scared.

4317
04:20:02,920 --> 04:20:04,920
Snork, madam.

4318
04:20:04,920 --> 04:20:06,920
Oh, I see here yet.

4319
04:20:06,920 --> 04:20:09,920
No, but we decided to go back to hibernating.

4320
04:20:18,920 --> 04:20:20,920
Papa!

4321
04:20:26,920 --> 04:20:30,920
I thought Christmas tree should have a star on top.

4322
04:20:30,920 --> 04:20:33,920
I don't think it makes any difference, you know?

4323
04:20:33,920 --> 04:20:36,920
A nice rose is just as good as a star.

4324
04:20:36,920 --> 04:20:38,920
Look at that!

4325
04:20:56,920 --> 04:20:58,920
Hi!

4326
04:21:01,920 --> 04:21:04,920
And apparently it didn't make any difference at all

4327
04:21:04,920 --> 04:21:09,920
because the Moonman family slept as peacefully as ever all through the night

4328
04:21:09,920 --> 04:21:13,920
without Christmas coming anywhere near them.

4329
04:21:13,920 --> 04:21:16,920
So probably he went someplace else.

4330
04:21:17,920 --> 04:21:25,920
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

4331
04:21:25,920 --> 04:21:33,920
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

4332
04:21:33,920 --> 04:21:37,920
They're always happy and goes at play.

4333
04:21:37,920 --> 04:21:44,920
The Moons are having fun day after day, the Moons.

4334
04:21:44,920 --> 04:21:47,920
The Moons.

4335
04:21:47,920 --> 04:21:50,920
The Moons.

4336
04:22:15,920 --> 04:22:19,920
Here they are for one and all.

4337
04:22:19,920 --> 04:22:22,920
The Moons are about to call.

4338
04:22:22,920 --> 04:22:25,920
Come on and sit down here with me.

4339
04:22:25,920 --> 04:22:28,920
They're here for you on your TV.

4340
04:22:28,920 --> 04:22:30,920
They are the movements.

4341
04:22:30,920 --> 04:22:33,920
They are the movements.

4342
04:22:33,920 --> 04:22:37,920
So come with me, give me your hand.

4343
04:22:37,920 --> 04:22:40,920
I'll take you up to a movement land.

4344
04:22:40,920 --> 04:22:43,920
You can fly just like a bird.

4345
04:22:43,920 --> 04:22:45,920
Sing with the song ever.

4346
04:22:45,920 --> 04:22:48,920
They're with the movement.

4347
04:22:48,920 --> 04:22:51,920
They're with the movements.

4348
04:22:51,920 --> 04:22:54,920
They're with the movements.

4349
04:22:54,920 --> 04:22:57,920
They're with the movements.

4350
04:22:57,920 --> 04:23:00,920
They're with the movements.

4351
04:23:00,920 --> 04:23:03,920
They're with the movements.

4352
04:23:13,920 --> 04:23:15,920
During his long winter sleep,

4353
04:23:15,920 --> 04:23:25,920
the woman had a dream.

4354
04:23:29,920 --> 04:23:33,920
And strangely enough, he dreamt that he was sleeping.

4355
04:23:33,920 --> 04:23:37,920
Moment! Moment! Moment!

4356
04:23:37,920 --> 04:23:39,920
Huh?

4357
04:23:43,920 --> 04:23:49,920
Alicia! Alicia! Wow! You can fly on the broomstick now!

4358
04:23:49,920 --> 04:23:53,920
That's right! I'm a fully fledged witch now, Moment!

4359
04:23:53,920 --> 04:23:57,920
Wait! Give me a ride, Alicia! Can't do that!

4360
04:23:57,920 --> 04:24:01,920
Oh, don't be mean, Alicia! Because someone's already riding with me!

4361
04:24:01,920 --> 04:24:03,920
Oops! Man, it's me!

4362
04:24:03,920 --> 04:24:05,920
Haha! Little boy!

4363
04:24:05,920 --> 04:24:09,920
Would you mind if we went a little higher, Alicia? Sure!

4364
04:24:09,920 --> 04:24:11,920
Oh, wow! Why, Alicia!

4365
04:24:11,920 --> 04:24:13,920
Oh, you're keeping me going!

4366
04:24:13,920 --> 04:24:15,920
What?

4367
04:24:15,920 --> 04:24:17,920
Oh, please, listen!

4368
04:24:17,920 --> 04:24:21,920
Come back! Please! Give me a ride, Alicia!

4369
04:24:21,920 --> 04:24:23,920
Haha!

4370
04:24:23,920 --> 04:24:25,920
Oh!

4371
04:24:25,920 --> 04:24:27,920
Yeah!

4372
04:24:35,920 --> 04:24:37,920
Oh, thank you, woman!

4373
04:24:39,920 --> 04:24:41,920
Will you give me a ride now?

4374
04:24:41,920 --> 04:24:43,920
Come on, now!

4375
04:24:59,920 --> 04:25:03,920
Moment, Val, he's really beautiful from up here.

4376
04:25:03,920 --> 04:25:05,920
Yes, lovely!

4377
04:25:05,920 --> 04:25:07,920
Oh, Alicia, be careful! Don't do things like that!

4378
04:25:07,920 --> 04:25:09,920
What are you talking about?

4379
04:25:09,920 --> 04:25:11,920
We're not doing anything, woman!

4380
04:25:11,920 --> 04:25:13,920
A little boy, it's you again!

4381
04:25:13,920 --> 04:25:15,920
No wonder the broom is shaking so much!

4382
04:25:15,920 --> 04:25:19,920
How do you like it? I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?

4383
04:25:19,920 --> 04:25:21,920
Where did you get this broom from, little boy?

4384
04:25:21,920 --> 04:25:23,920
I borrowed it from the witch!

4385
04:25:23,920 --> 04:25:25,920
I borrowed it for a while!

4386
04:25:25,920 --> 04:25:27,920
That's the witch, isn't it?

4387
04:25:27,920 --> 04:25:29,920
Looks like it!

4388
04:25:29,920 --> 04:25:31,920
Maybe we better get out of here!

4389
04:25:31,920 --> 04:25:33,920
You're right! Stop!

4390
04:25:33,920 --> 04:25:35,920
You two little thieves! Give me back my bread at once!

4391
04:25:35,920 --> 04:25:37,920
No!

4392
04:25:37,920 --> 04:25:39,920
Yeah!

4393
04:25:39,920 --> 04:25:41,920
You have your own broom!

4394
04:25:41,920 --> 04:25:43,920
You witches should learn how to share!

4395
04:25:43,920 --> 04:25:45,920
But it's not the one who's just a spare!

4396
04:25:45,920 --> 04:25:47,920
I want my veil from back right now!

4397
04:25:47,920 --> 04:25:49,920
Finders, keepers, it's my broom!

4398
04:25:49,920 --> 04:25:51,920
Cut out a broom?

4399
04:25:51,920 --> 04:25:53,920
Huh! Why don't you take a closer look at it?

4400
04:25:53,920 --> 04:25:55,920
That's not a broom, huh?

4401
04:25:55,920 --> 04:25:57,920
What do you mean this is not a broom?

4402
04:25:57,920 --> 04:25:59,920
Oh!

4403
04:26:01,920 --> 04:26:03,920
Oh!

4404
04:26:03,920 --> 04:26:05,920
Oh!

4405
04:26:05,920 --> 04:26:07,920
Oh, little boy!

4406
04:26:07,920 --> 04:26:09,920
Hey!

4407
04:26:09,920 --> 04:26:11,920
Little boy!

4408
04:26:11,920 --> 04:26:13,920
You're right, little boy!

4409
04:26:13,920 --> 04:26:15,920
Little boy, isn't he, or a little boy?

4410
04:26:15,920 --> 04:26:17,920
Oh! Oh!

4411
04:26:17,920 --> 04:26:19,920
I must have been dreaming!

4412
04:26:19,920 --> 04:26:21,920
You were yelling out loud!

4413
04:26:21,920 --> 04:26:23,920
Oh, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to wake you up, Snorkman!

4414
04:26:23,920 --> 04:26:25,920
Can you see anything?

4415
04:26:25,920 --> 04:26:27,920
Only snow!

4416
04:26:27,920 --> 04:26:29,920
Everything's so light!

4417
04:26:29,920 --> 04:26:31,920
Yes, the moon is up!

4418
04:26:31,920 --> 04:26:33,920
Oh, what an eerie light!

4419
04:26:33,920 --> 04:26:35,920
Yes!

4420
04:26:35,920 --> 04:26:37,920
Spring hasn't arrived yet, has it?

4421
04:26:37,920 --> 04:26:39,920
Not yet!

4422
04:26:39,920 --> 04:26:41,920
Everybody else is still asleep then?

4423
04:26:41,920 --> 04:26:43,920
Yes, most of them anyway!

4424
04:26:43,920 --> 04:26:45,920
Wonder if my brother's still up!

4425
04:26:45,920 --> 04:26:47,920
Well, he did say before we started hyprinating

4426
04:26:47,920 --> 04:26:49,920
he wanted to finish his blooper!

4427
04:26:49,920 --> 04:26:51,920
Before spring, if he could!

4428
04:26:51,920 --> 04:26:53,920
I hope he'll succeed this time!

4429
04:26:53,920 --> 04:26:55,920
When he go out!

4430
04:26:55,920 --> 04:26:57,920
Huh?

4431
04:26:57,920 --> 04:26:59,920
Outside, just to see what the snow looks like!

4432
04:26:59,920 --> 04:27:01,920
Oh, no!

4433
04:27:01,920 --> 04:27:03,920
I don't really feel like it!

4434
04:27:03,920 --> 04:27:05,920
It's nice and warm here!

4435
04:27:05,920 --> 04:27:09,920
Why don't we sleep till spring like the others?

4436
04:27:09,920 --> 04:27:13,920
Spring is still a long way off!

4437
04:27:13,920 --> 04:27:15,920
Guess you're right!

4438
04:27:15,920 --> 04:27:17,920
It is nice and warm in here!

4439
04:27:17,920 --> 04:27:19,920
It is nice and warm in here!

4440
04:27:19,920 --> 04:27:21,920
I don't really feel like it!

4441
04:27:21,920 --> 04:27:23,920
It is nice and warm in here!

4442
04:27:23,920 --> 04:27:25,920
Spring is still a long way off!

4443
04:27:25,920 --> 04:27:27,920
Spring is still a long way off!

4444
04:27:27,920 --> 04:27:29,920
Spring is still a long way off!

4445
04:27:29,920 --> 04:27:31,920
Spring is still a long way off!

4446
04:27:31,920 --> 04:27:33,920
Spring is still a long way off!

4447
04:27:33,920 --> 04:27:35,920
There!

4448
04:27:35,920 --> 04:27:39,920
It's delicious chocolate cakes my favorite!

4449
04:27:39,920 --> 04:27:41,920
Yes, I like it!

4450
04:27:41,920 --> 04:27:43,920
Did you say something, Snorkman?

4451
04:27:43,920 --> 04:27:45,920
I'm so very hungry moment!

4452
04:27:45,920 --> 04:27:54,920
Your mother's raspberry juice is really the best.

4453
04:27:54,920 --> 04:27:57,920
It is, isn't it? Everybody said that last winter too.

4454
04:27:57,920 --> 04:27:58,920
Hey, Moonman.

4455
04:27:58,920 --> 04:27:59,920
Yeah?

4456
04:27:59,920 --> 04:28:02,920
I have a funny feeling. Someone is watching us and I don't like you.

4457
04:28:02,920 --> 04:28:03,920
One little bit.

4458
04:28:03,920 --> 04:28:05,920
Moonman Papa could explain it.

4459
04:28:05,920 --> 04:28:06,920
I'm sure.

4460
04:28:06,920 --> 04:28:07,920
Of course someone's watching.

4461
04:28:07,920 --> 04:28:09,920
What the hell? And how do you know?

4462
04:28:09,920 --> 04:28:12,920
Too thick. He told me all about it last winter snort maiden.

4463
04:28:12,920 --> 04:28:17,920
She doesn't hibernate, you know. She lives in our bathhouse and watches over us in the winter.

4464
04:28:17,920 --> 04:28:21,920
She said that many things are too shy to show themselves.

4465
04:28:21,920 --> 04:28:23,920
Oh, have you seen them yourself?

4466
04:28:23,920 --> 04:28:26,920
Sort of. Except they were invisible, of course.

4467
04:28:26,920 --> 04:28:28,920
Like under the sink.

4468
04:28:28,920 --> 04:28:30,920
Or in the clock, maybe.

4469
04:28:30,920 --> 04:28:35,920
In the empty fireplace and other dark corners of the room, I can feel it.

4470
04:28:35,920 --> 04:28:38,920
Did you actually look anywhere for them?

4471
04:28:38,920 --> 04:28:40,920
Oh, no. They'd be very upset.

4472
04:28:40,920 --> 04:28:43,920
It's better not to let them know we know where they are.

4473
04:28:43,920 --> 04:28:45,920
I wonder what these things look like.

4474
04:28:45,920 --> 04:28:48,920
Some of them look very much like us, too, Tiki said.

4475
04:28:48,920 --> 04:28:51,920
Old ancestors of ours from way back, she thinks.

4476
04:28:51,920 --> 04:28:53,920
Some of them look like us, she said.

4477
04:28:53,920 --> 04:28:55,920
Well, I've never seen them for myself.

4478
04:28:55,920 --> 04:28:58,920
I wonder if there is good looking as we are.

4479
04:29:03,920 --> 04:29:06,920
Wouldn't it be a good idea to stay up and wait for the sunrise?

4480
04:29:06,920 --> 04:29:08,920
A great idea.

4481
04:29:11,920 --> 04:29:20,920
Now, don't say anything to scare them, but this is one of the movement's ancestors from way back.

4482
04:29:22,920 --> 04:29:24,920
Is it morning already?

4483
04:29:24,920 --> 04:29:25,920
Are you sure?

4484
04:29:25,920 --> 04:29:26,920
I think so.

4485
04:29:26,920 --> 04:29:28,920
There are no clouds, so why can't we see the sun?

4486
04:29:28,920 --> 04:29:32,920
I guess maybe the sun doesn't come up at all this time of the year.

4487
04:29:32,920 --> 04:29:37,920
Mom and I don't like this. I don't like your one little bit.

4488
04:29:38,920 --> 04:29:41,920
You silly little girl, what do you need this for?

4489
04:29:41,920 --> 04:29:44,920
Please grandma, I won't be long, I promise.

4490
04:29:44,920 --> 04:29:47,920
What are you talking about is if you could fly a broom,

4491
04:29:47,920 --> 04:29:49,920
get back back to me at once.

4492
04:29:49,920 --> 04:29:51,920
No, I won't give it back.

4493
04:29:51,920 --> 04:29:53,920
Now give me back that broom and don't be silly.

4494
04:29:53,920 --> 04:29:56,920
How many times from sight tell you you can't go visiting Moomin Valley?

4495
04:29:56,920 --> 04:29:58,920
But it's so boring here.

4496
04:29:58,920 --> 04:30:00,920
I want some company grandma.

4497
04:30:01,920 --> 04:30:03,920
Come on, broom fly off.

4498
04:30:03,920 --> 04:30:05,920
Take me to Moomin Valley.

4499
04:30:08,920 --> 04:30:12,920
Help me up grandma, please.

4500
04:30:14,920 --> 04:30:17,920
All right, my girl, I'll help you up, shall I?

4501
04:30:22,920 --> 04:30:24,920
I don't believe it, I'm floating.

4502
04:30:27,920 --> 04:30:30,920
How far? This is great.

4503
04:30:30,920 --> 04:30:31,920
Wait.

4504
04:30:31,920 --> 04:30:33,920
Oh, I'm falling.

4505
04:30:38,920 --> 04:30:40,920
Oh, how about that?

4506
04:30:40,920 --> 04:30:42,920
I'll find a bird around here.

4507
04:30:44,920 --> 04:30:47,920
Or to bury things again, how about this?

4508
04:30:47,920 --> 04:30:50,920
Oh no, stop the broom grandma, please.

4509
04:30:51,920 --> 04:30:54,920
Come on, you wanted to ride on the broom, didn't you?

4510
04:30:54,920 --> 04:30:55,920
You first saw the bike?

4511
04:30:55,920 --> 04:30:56,920
Well, we did.

4512
04:30:59,920 --> 04:31:01,920
Mom, please don't.

4513
04:31:07,920 --> 04:31:10,920
If you want to learn to fly on this broom, Alicia,

4514
04:31:10,920 --> 04:31:12,920
then forget all about those dreaded Moomin's

4515
04:31:12,920 --> 04:31:14,920
and really start studying.

4516
04:31:14,920 --> 04:31:16,920
It's hard work, you know, young woman.

4517
04:31:16,920 --> 04:31:18,920
You must learn to concentrate.

4518
04:31:24,920 --> 04:31:25,920
Hey, you up there.

4519
04:31:25,920 --> 04:31:27,920
Are you making fun of me, too?

4520
04:31:33,920 --> 04:31:35,920
Oh, I can't climb down there.

4521
04:31:35,920 --> 04:31:37,920
Of course you can, even if you fall.

4522
04:31:37,920 --> 04:31:40,920
You can't hurt yourself on this soft snow.

4523
04:31:40,920 --> 04:31:42,920
Don't shake the ladder, Moomin.

4524
04:31:42,920 --> 04:31:43,920
This is scary.

4525
04:31:43,920 --> 04:31:45,920
Slowly does it.

4526
04:31:45,920 --> 04:31:47,920
Take it easy and don't look down.

4527
04:31:47,920 --> 04:31:50,920
Maybe going out wasn't such a good idea after all.

4528
04:31:50,920 --> 04:31:53,920
We can always change our minds and go back to sleep, you know.

4529
04:31:53,920 --> 04:31:55,920
See, you've made it.

4530
04:31:55,920 --> 04:31:58,920
It's very cool though to hear Moomin, but I rather like it.

4531
04:32:01,920 --> 04:32:04,920
Oh, this is the roof over the front door, isn't it?

4532
04:32:04,920 --> 04:32:07,920
Yes, and everything will be snowed up now to spring.

4533
04:32:07,920 --> 04:32:10,920
Oh no, what's happened to our firewood?

4534
04:32:15,920 --> 04:32:16,920
What's the matter?

4535
04:32:16,920 --> 04:32:18,920
There's not much wood left in here.

4536
04:32:18,920 --> 04:32:20,920
Someone else must be burning it.

4537
04:32:20,920 --> 04:32:23,920
Yes, but who and for what I wonder?

4538
04:32:25,920 --> 04:32:26,920
I can feel it.

4539
04:32:26,920 --> 04:32:27,920
We're not alone in this forest.

4540
04:32:27,920 --> 04:32:29,920
I'm sure someone's watching us.

4541
04:32:29,920 --> 04:32:31,920
All those winter creatures.

4542
04:32:31,920 --> 04:32:33,920
No, I don't think it's them.

4543
04:32:35,920 --> 04:32:37,920
The grog.

4544
04:32:42,920 --> 04:32:46,920
Goodness me, look how big she gets in the wintertime.

4545
04:32:46,920 --> 04:32:49,920
Moomin, I'm scared.

4546
04:32:49,920 --> 04:32:51,920
It'll be all right.

4547
04:32:51,920 --> 04:32:54,920
Grog, stop right there.

4548
04:32:56,920 --> 04:32:58,920
Don't come any closer if you please.

4549
04:32:58,920 --> 04:33:01,920
You're much, much too cold for us, you see.

4550
04:33:01,920 --> 04:33:03,920
You could freeze a stiff, you know.

4551
04:33:05,920 --> 04:33:09,920
Oh, is it possible that you get lonely all by yourself?

4552
04:33:11,920 --> 04:33:14,920
I don't think there's anything we can do to help you know,

4553
04:33:14,920 --> 04:33:18,920
not without fur coats and earmuffs and worn gloves anyway.

4554
04:33:18,920 --> 04:33:19,920
We must go.

4555
04:33:35,920 --> 04:33:37,920
Someone's been stealing our firewood.

4556
04:33:37,920 --> 04:33:39,920
I wonder what they're doing with it.

4557
04:33:39,920 --> 04:33:42,920
Something bad, there's no doubt about that.

4558
04:33:42,920 --> 04:33:45,920
Must've been several people did this.

4559
04:33:46,920 --> 04:33:48,920
We had a lot of fun here in the summer.

4560
04:33:48,920 --> 04:33:49,920
Remember?

4561
04:33:49,920 --> 04:33:52,920
Well, the she is still here round the ice.

4562
04:33:52,920 --> 04:33:53,920
I hope.

4563
04:33:53,920 --> 04:33:56,920
Too, Tiki! Too, Tiki!

4564
04:34:15,920 --> 04:34:16,920
There's no one here.

4565
04:34:16,920 --> 04:34:17,920
Are you sure?

4566
04:34:17,920 --> 04:34:18,920
Look for yourself.

4567
04:34:21,920 --> 04:34:24,920
I know they're invisible, but I'm a shroom ice in here.

4568
04:34:24,920 --> 04:34:27,920
Hard to tell, with things you can't see.

4569
04:34:28,920 --> 04:34:30,920
Oh, what is it?

4570
04:34:30,920 --> 04:34:33,920
It felt like something scampering on my back.

4571
04:34:33,920 --> 04:34:36,920
That's all right, it must be one of the shroom ice.

4572
04:34:40,920 --> 04:34:42,920
Moomin, Moomin.

4573
04:34:43,920 --> 04:34:46,920
Oh, where could he have gone?

4574
04:34:48,920 --> 04:34:52,920
My goodness, I've never seen anything quite like this before.

4575
04:34:52,920 --> 04:34:54,920
Hi, it's good to see you.

4576
04:34:54,920 --> 04:34:56,920
You're right, she's fishing.

4577
04:34:56,920 --> 04:34:57,920
Hi, too, Tiki!

4578
04:34:57,920 --> 04:34:59,920
Hello, too, Tiki!

4579
04:34:59,920 --> 04:35:02,920
So this winter's not made in woke up too, huh?

4580
04:35:02,920 --> 04:35:04,920
I walk her up by mistake.

4581
04:35:04,920 --> 04:35:07,920
You know that spring is still a long way off, don't you?

4582
04:35:07,920 --> 04:35:10,920
I thought it might be seeing there's no sun at all.

4583
04:35:10,920 --> 04:35:13,920
But the sun is gonna come back tomorrow, Moomin.

4584
04:35:13,920 --> 04:35:14,920
Tomorrow?

4585
04:35:14,920 --> 04:35:17,920
It's Northmaiden was so worried about the sun not showing.

4586
04:35:17,920 --> 04:35:21,920
The sun will rise tomorrow, Moomin, but it'll go down very soon.

4587
04:35:21,920 --> 04:35:25,920
Too, Tiki, you know, I think there must be records in Moomin Valley.

4588
04:35:25,920 --> 04:35:27,920
Records in winter?

4589
04:35:27,920 --> 04:35:30,920
There's an enormous pile of firewood up on the hillside.

4590
04:35:30,920 --> 04:35:34,920
Oh, I know, it took a long time to collect that wood.

4591
04:35:34,920 --> 04:35:36,920
But some of it belongs to us.

4592
04:35:36,920 --> 04:35:39,920
Hmm, that doesn't really surprise me, though, Moomin.

4593
04:35:39,920 --> 04:35:43,920
I'm afraid the winter creatures aren't very careful about ownership.

4594
04:35:43,920 --> 04:35:46,920
They need a lot, so if they see it, they take it.

4595
04:35:46,920 --> 04:35:48,920
It's for their big winter bonfire.

4596
04:35:48,920 --> 04:35:49,920
A bonfire?

4597
04:35:49,920 --> 04:35:53,920
Yes, and now your firewood can take part in the big celebration.

4598
04:35:53,920 --> 04:35:57,920
They light it every winter to make sure the sun comes back, you know.

4599
04:35:57,920 --> 04:36:01,920
Oh, you mean otherwise the sun wouldn't come back, Tiki?

4600
04:36:01,920 --> 04:36:06,920
Well, since they always light it on this day, you don't really know, do you?

4601
04:36:06,920 --> 04:36:08,920
Tonight you might see the winter creatures.

4602
04:36:08,920 --> 04:36:11,920
Okay, we come along as well, Tiki.

4603
04:36:11,920 --> 04:36:12,920
Yes, you can.

4604
04:36:12,920 --> 04:36:15,920
If you sit quietly and don't scare them in any way.

4605
04:36:15,920 --> 04:36:17,920
Wonderful. You're coming along, too, aren't you?

4606
04:36:17,920 --> 04:36:19,920
It, of course.

4607
04:36:19,920 --> 04:36:21,920
Stop! Help me!

4608
04:36:21,920 --> 04:36:23,920
Someone shouting for help?

4609
04:36:23,920 --> 04:36:24,920
Who could it be?

4610
04:36:24,920 --> 04:36:27,920
Go away! Get away from me!

4611
04:36:27,920 --> 04:36:30,920
I didn't do it on purpose! I didn't mean any harm!

4612
04:36:30,920 --> 04:36:34,920
If you don't leave me alone, Grandma will turn you into a toad!

4613
04:36:34,920 --> 04:36:37,920
Oh, that's so cold! Go away, please!

4614
04:36:37,920 --> 04:36:41,920
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

4615
04:36:45,920 --> 04:36:47,920
Grow! Leave her alone!

4616
04:36:47,920 --> 04:36:49,920
What are you doing, Grog?

4617
04:36:52,920 --> 04:36:53,920
Move, man!

4618
04:36:53,920 --> 04:36:54,920
Alicia!

4619
04:36:54,920 --> 04:36:57,920
Now listen, Grog, why can't you be nice to her?

4620
04:36:57,920 --> 04:36:58,920
Alicia is one of my friends.

4621
04:36:58,920 --> 04:37:02,920
She was just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis.

4622
04:37:02,920 --> 04:37:05,920
I nearly bumped into her, but I didn't touch her.

4623
04:37:05,920 --> 04:37:06,920
That's all right, Alicia.

4624
04:37:06,920 --> 04:37:08,920
Tell me, Grog, what's gotten into you?

4625
04:37:08,920 --> 04:37:10,920
Why are you so nasty to such a sweet little girl?

4626
04:37:10,920 --> 04:37:12,920
It isn't like you at all.

4627
04:37:12,920 --> 04:37:18,920
I must have startled her, I guess, and I didn't apologize at all, but it made no difference.

4628
04:37:18,920 --> 04:37:20,920
This is really, very odd.

4629
04:37:20,920 --> 04:37:24,920
Then I asked if she had seen you, and that's when she started to get mad at me.

4630
04:37:24,920 --> 04:37:26,920
And she doesn't even know me.

4631
04:37:26,920 --> 04:37:27,920
It's a mystery.

4632
04:37:27,920 --> 04:37:30,920
Whatever's the matter with you, Grog.

4633
04:37:30,920 --> 04:37:32,920
Whoa!

4634
04:37:44,920 --> 04:37:46,920
Oh, I was so scared.

4635
04:37:46,920 --> 04:37:48,920
I'm so glad you've come to see us.

4636
04:37:48,920 --> 04:37:50,920
So am I, women.

4637
04:37:50,920 --> 04:37:53,920
Somehow I felt certain you hadn't gone into hibernation yet.

4638
04:37:53,920 --> 04:37:56,920
But what did your grandmother say?

4639
04:37:56,920 --> 04:37:59,920
Nothing because I didn't tell her I was coming.

4640
04:37:59,920 --> 04:38:01,920
Thank you for chasing off that terrible monster.

4641
04:38:01,920 --> 04:38:04,920
The Grog hasn't actually ever attacked anyone.

4642
04:38:04,920 --> 04:38:07,920
Well, maybe she doesn't like the look of Alicia.

4643
04:38:07,920 --> 04:38:09,920
Snork maiden.

4644
04:38:09,920 --> 04:38:12,920
It's really a mystery to me why the Grog was here at all.

4645
04:38:12,920 --> 04:38:15,920
She was here looking for a moment no doubt.

4646
04:38:15,920 --> 04:38:16,920
Was she?

4647
04:38:16,920 --> 04:38:19,920
He suddenly become very popular.

4648
04:38:19,920 --> 04:38:20,920
Huh?

4649
04:38:20,920 --> 04:38:22,920
You don't mean...

4650
04:38:22,920 --> 04:38:28,920
What's the matter with you?

4651
04:38:28,920 --> 04:38:31,920
I think the Grog may have fallen in love with you, woman.

4652
04:38:31,920 --> 04:38:32,920
What?

4653
04:38:32,920 --> 04:38:34,920
Oh, you can't mean that.

4654
04:38:34,920 --> 04:38:36,920
Please tell me you're not serious.

4655
04:38:36,920 --> 04:38:38,920
It's out of the question.

4656
04:38:38,920 --> 04:38:39,920
It's her ridiculous idea.

4657
04:38:39,920 --> 04:38:41,920
Don't be so silly.

4658
04:38:41,920 --> 04:39:01,920
Where is all that drumming noise coming from?

4659
04:39:01,920 --> 04:39:11,640
Where's all that drumming noise coming from?

4660
04:39:11,640 --> 04:39:14,440
From the invisible shroom ice.

4661
04:39:14,440 --> 04:39:16,480
How long before everybody arrives?

4662
04:39:16,480 --> 04:39:19,480
Oh, they're here already, Moomin, all around us.

4663
04:39:19,480 --> 04:39:20,480
They are?

4664
04:39:20,480 --> 04:39:21,480
Where?

4665
04:39:21,480 --> 04:39:22,480
I can't see them.

4666
04:39:22,480 --> 04:39:24,720
Are they really invisible?

4667
04:39:24,720 --> 04:39:29,680
I can't see them either, but I can feel their presence all around me.

4668
04:39:30,080 --> 04:39:33,400
But she's been studying witchcraft, hasn't she?

4669
04:39:33,400 --> 04:39:38,400
I'm sure you and Moomin will be able to feel their presence quite soon.

4670
04:40:00,680 --> 04:40:01,680
Oh!

4671
04:40:21,680 --> 04:40:25,680
I can see some of them looking all over there.

4672
04:40:30,680 --> 04:40:31,680
Oh!

4673
04:40:35,680 --> 04:40:38,680
I can't see them, too, you guys.

4674
04:40:43,680 --> 04:40:46,680
Dootie, can you tell me why can't we see all of them?

4675
04:40:46,680 --> 04:40:48,680
Well, we can never see them all.

4676
04:40:48,680 --> 04:40:52,680
I don't understand how did you know earlier on the shroom ice were playing the drums.

4677
04:40:52,680 --> 04:40:56,680
I just know because they sometimes play them in the batch house as well.

4678
04:40:56,680 --> 04:40:58,680
What a wonderful celebration.

4679
04:40:58,680 --> 04:41:03,680
Isn't it lucky I came over here if I had not had missed a most memorable evening?

4680
04:41:18,680 --> 04:41:20,680
What's going on here?

4681
04:41:20,680 --> 04:41:22,680
The grog.

4682
04:41:22,680 --> 04:41:23,680
What?

4683
04:41:24,680 --> 04:41:28,680
What's she going on here?

4684
04:41:28,680 --> 04:41:32,680
She must be looking for Moomin again, I guess.

4685
04:41:32,680 --> 04:41:35,680
No, I think she just wants to warm herself by the fire.

4686
04:41:36,680 --> 04:41:39,680
But what's she doing?

4687
04:42:00,680 --> 04:42:04,680
Well, that's the end of the midwinter bonfire.

4688
04:42:04,680 --> 04:42:05,680
Pull, grog.

4689
04:42:05,680 --> 04:42:07,680
She freezes everything she touches.

4690
04:42:07,680 --> 04:42:13,680
Whatever she sits on, even the hottest bonfire turns freezing cold in a matter of seconds.

4691
04:42:13,680 --> 04:42:17,680
Well, at least she's managed to save some of our wood.

4692
04:42:25,680 --> 04:42:29,680
Don't hold on tight now, Snorkemaid, and I'm be careful.

4693
04:42:29,680 --> 04:42:32,680
I can't wait to get into bed.

4694
04:42:32,680 --> 04:42:35,680
I wanted to stay up until the sun came up again.

4695
04:42:35,680 --> 04:42:38,680
But I don't know if I could keep awake till then.

4696
04:42:38,680 --> 04:42:41,680
So long till spring then, Moomin.

4697
04:42:41,680 --> 04:42:43,680
Goodbye.

4698
04:42:43,680 --> 04:42:45,680
And take care, Alicia.

4699
04:42:45,680 --> 04:42:47,680
I will, Moomin.

4700
04:42:47,680 --> 04:42:50,680
The moon will light my way back.

4701
04:43:02,680 --> 04:43:05,680
This time, the Moomin's have gone too far.

4702
04:43:05,680 --> 04:43:06,680
Something must be done.

4703
04:43:06,680 --> 04:43:09,680
I'll teach them a lesson they'll never forget.

4704
04:43:09,680 --> 04:43:12,680
They won't get the better at me.

4705
04:43:12,680 --> 04:43:17,680
Now, what does the witch mean by teach them a lesson?

4706
04:43:17,680 --> 04:43:20,680
That sounds very ominous.

4707
04:43:20,680 --> 04:43:24,680
Let's hope at least that she lets them sleep till next spring.

4708
04:43:32,680 --> 04:43:35,680
Moomin.

4709
04:44:02,680 --> 04:44:05,680
Moomin.

4710
04:44:05,680 --> 04:44:08,680
Moomin.

4711
04:44:08,680 --> 04:44:11,680
Moomin.

4712
04:44:11,680 --> 04:44:14,680
Moomin.

4713
04:44:32,680 --> 04:44:35,680
Moomin.

4714
04:44:35,680 --> 04:44:38,680
Here they are for one and all.

4715
04:44:38,680 --> 04:44:41,680
The Moomin's are about to call.

4716
04:44:41,680 --> 04:44:44,680
Come on and sit down here with me.

4717
04:44:44,680 --> 04:44:46,680
Therefore you are your TV.

4718
04:44:46,680 --> 04:44:49,680
They are the Moomin's.

4719
04:44:49,680 --> 04:44:52,680
They are the Moomin's.

4720
04:44:52,680 --> 04:44:55,680
So come with me, give me your hand.

4721
04:44:55,680 --> 04:44:58,680
I'll take you up to Moomin land.

4722
04:44:58,680 --> 04:45:01,680
You can fly just like a bird.

4723
04:45:01,680 --> 04:45:04,680
Sing that song ever.

4724
04:45:04,680 --> 04:45:06,680
There were the Moomin's.

4725
04:45:06,680 --> 04:45:12,680
There were the Moomin's.

4726
04:45:12,680 --> 04:45:15,680
There were the Moomin's.

4727
04:45:15,680 --> 04:45:18,680
There were the Moomin's.

4728
04:45:18,680 --> 04:45:22,680
There were the Moomin's.

4729
04:45:31,680 --> 04:46:01,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

4730
04:46:01,680 --> 04:46:31,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

4731
04:46:31,680 --> 04:46:36,080
But right now.

4732
04:46:36,080 --> 04:46:38,580
The witch has come to Moomin Valley.

4733
04:46:38,580 --> 04:46:41,080
What could she be up to this time?

4734
04:46:41,080 --> 04:46:44,160
Eldregrapala Zoom! Eldregrapala Zoom!

4735
04:46:44,160 --> 04:46:46,880
Eldregrapala Zoom! Eldregrapala Zoom!

4736
04:46:46,880 --> 04:46:52,720
Eldregrapala Zoom! Jazzy Shrimp!

4737
04:46:52,720 --> 04:46:57,460
Eldregrapala Zoom! Eldregrapala Zoom!

4738
04:46:57,460 --> 04:46:59,460
He'll just come out as old!

4739
04:47:02,020 --> 04:47:05,260
Always snowing again. I must get a covered brown.

4740
04:47:27,460 --> 04:47:36,460
The great thaw had come at last.

4741
04:47:42,460 --> 04:47:44,460
The Moomin Valley.

4742
04:47:49,460 --> 04:47:51,460
I think I can smell spring!

4743
04:47:52,460 --> 04:47:56,460
Oh, I've never seen anything like this one before.

4744
04:48:04,460 --> 04:48:06,460
Hello there, Mr. Hemielun.

4745
04:48:06,460 --> 04:48:09,460
Hello, Sniff. You're up early this year?

4746
04:48:09,460 --> 04:48:12,460
Yes. I think I've even beat Moomin to it.

4747
04:48:12,460 --> 04:48:16,460
Is that so? Why are the Moomin so late this year?

4748
04:48:22,460 --> 04:48:27,460
Moomin, wake up! Spring is here! It's time to wake up!

4749
04:48:27,460 --> 04:48:28,460
Moomin!

4750
04:48:29,460 --> 04:48:32,460
Maybe Snork Maiden's easier to wake up.

4751
04:48:32,460 --> 04:48:34,460
Snork Maiden!

4752
04:48:35,460 --> 04:48:39,460
And I thought I was difficult to wake up. I must get closer.

4753
04:48:39,460 --> 04:48:40,460
Yes.

4754
04:48:49,460 --> 04:48:51,460
What are you doing, Sniff?

4755
04:48:51,460 --> 04:48:53,460
What am I doing? You can see, can't you?

4756
04:48:53,460 --> 04:48:55,460
Of course I can, but why are you climbing up that?

4757
04:48:55,460 --> 04:48:58,460
Moomin and Snork Maiden are still asleep. I have to wake them up.

4758
04:48:58,460 --> 04:49:02,460
Why don't you go this way? It's easier!

4759
04:49:03,460 --> 04:49:05,460
What are you doing?

4760
04:49:11,460 --> 04:49:14,460
Funny, even Moomin Mama's still asleep.

4761
04:49:19,460 --> 04:49:21,460
Wrong room.

4762
04:49:23,460 --> 04:49:26,460
Come on! Wake up, lazy bones!

4763
04:49:27,460 --> 04:49:29,460
Moomin, spring has come!

4764
04:49:37,460 --> 04:49:40,460
We'll look at that! Wake up, you sleepyhead!

4765
04:49:40,460 --> 04:49:43,460
Oh, you really are impossible!

4766
04:49:43,460 --> 04:49:47,460
Moomin, Moomin, Moomin! This is odd, even for Moomin!

4767
04:49:50,460 --> 04:49:52,460
Open the window, little mind!

4768
04:49:57,460 --> 04:50:01,460
Oh, was I scared?

4769
04:50:02,460 --> 04:50:05,460
Oh, I haven't you opened them up!

4770
04:50:05,460 --> 04:50:07,460
I've tried, but they won't!

4771
04:50:08,460 --> 04:50:10,460
You're kidding!

4772
04:50:12,460 --> 04:50:14,460
No one can resist this little mind!

4773
04:50:15,460 --> 04:50:18,460
Wake up, Moomin! I know you're ticklish!

4774
04:50:21,460 --> 04:50:23,460
Moomin, Moomin!

4775
04:50:23,460 --> 04:50:25,460
I told you so!

4776
04:50:27,460 --> 04:50:31,460
Moomin, come on!

4777
04:50:42,460 --> 04:50:44,460
How strange!

4778
04:50:44,460 --> 04:50:46,460
How sad!

4779
04:50:46,460 --> 04:50:47,460
What do you mean?

4780
04:50:47,460 --> 04:50:49,460
I think...

4781
04:50:51,460 --> 04:50:54,460
It's hard to tell. I was listening for a heartbeat.

4782
04:50:56,460 --> 04:50:58,460
He's still breathing.

4783
04:50:59,460 --> 04:51:01,460
And Snork made it?

4784
04:51:02,460 --> 04:51:05,460
Wake up, you slug of it!

4785
04:51:05,460 --> 04:51:07,460
Snork made it!

4786
04:51:08,460 --> 04:51:10,460
They won't wake up!

4787
04:51:10,460 --> 04:51:11,460
This is strange!

4788
04:51:11,460 --> 04:51:13,460
Why don't we go and try the other?

4789
04:51:13,460 --> 04:51:14,460
Yes, why not?

4790
04:51:14,460 --> 04:51:17,460
I hate it when others are asleep while I'm up.

4791
04:51:17,460 --> 04:51:21,460
But then I don't like it much the other way around either, do I, Snip?

4792
04:51:22,460 --> 04:51:24,460
Moomin, pop up, please wake up!

4793
04:51:24,460 --> 04:51:26,460
We've tried to wake up, Moomin, but he won't!

4794
04:51:26,460 --> 04:51:28,460
Wakey, Moomin!

4795
04:51:28,460 --> 04:51:30,460
Mama breakfast time!

4796
04:51:30,460 --> 04:51:32,460
Come on, Moomin, pop up!

4797
04:51:32,460 --> 04:51:34,460
Wake up!

4798
04:51:34,460 --> 04:51:36,460
This is no use!

4799
04:51:44,460 --> 04:51:47,460
Goodness, it seems the Moomin's are still hibernating.

4800
04:51:47,460 --> 04:51:49,460
And so is Snork Maiden.

4801
04:51:49,460 --> 04:51:52,460
That's odd. She always wakes up even before me.

4802
04:51:52,460 --> 04:51:56,460
Oh, Moomin, too, but this year it seems to be different.

4803
04:51:56,460 --> 04:51:59,460
I'll go back home, and I'll come over again in a little while

4804
04:51:59,460 --> 04:52:01,460
when the Moomin family will have woken up.

4805
04:52:01,460 --> 04:52:03,460
If they ever do.

4806
04:52:03,460 --> 04:52:04,460
Huh?

4807
04:52:04,460 --> 04:52:06,460
We've tried everything to wake them up,

4808
04:52:06,460 --> 04:52:08,460
short of buckets of water, and there's no moving them.

4809
04:52:08,460 --> 04:52:12,460
We've shouted and shook and pinched and tickled and stopped!

4810
04:52:12,460 --> 04:52:13,460
Oh, dear!

4811
04:52:13,460 --> 04:52:15,460
It's not just strange, it's ominous.

4812
04:52:15,460 --> 04:52:17,460
Oh, my, surely not.

4813
04:52:18,460 --> 04:52:20,460
Hello, everybody.

4814
04:52:20,460 --> 04:52:22,460
How is everyone?

4815
04:52:22,460 --> 04:52:23,460
What is it?

4816
04:52:23,460 --> 04:52:26,460
You all look very scared.

4817
04:52:26,460 --> 04:52:28,460
Huh?

4818
04:52:28,460 --> 04:52:31,460
Still hibernating?

4819
04:52:34,460 --> 04:52:37,460
It's all very strange, habulin.

4820
04:52:38,460 --> 04:52:40,460
Moomin!

4821
04:52:40,460 --> 04:52:41,460
See?

4822
04:52:41,460 --> 04:52:43,460
Yes, indeed.

4823
04:52:44,460 --> 04:52:48,460
How we can really do is wait and see.

4824
04:52:48,460 --> 04:52:50,460
I suppose you're right.

4825
04:52:50,460 --> 04:52:53,460
Don't worry, the days are getting longer all the time now,

4826
04:52:53,460 --> 04:52:55,460
so the Moomin's can't sleep much longer.

4827
04:52:55,460 --> 04:52:57,460
And Snork Maiden?

4828
04:52:57,460 --> 04:53:00,460
Cheat too, of course.

4829
04:53:00,460 --> 04:53:03,460
Bet you anything Moomin wakes up when Snuffkin returns.

4830
04:53:03,460 --> 04:53:05,460
I think you're right, Sniff.

4831
04:53:05,460 --> 04:53:09,460
And then, one day about a week later,

4832
04:53:09,460 --> 04:53:14,460
Snuffkin did come back from his yearly trip south.

4833
04:53:15,460 --> 04:53:17,460
Snuffkin!

4834
04:53:37,460 --> 04:53:39,460
Snuffkin!

4835
04:53:45,460 --> 04:53:47,460
Snuffkin!

4836
04:53:50,460 --> 04:53:52,460
Snuffkin!

4837
04:53:52,460 --> 04:53:54,460
Snuffkin!

4838
04:54:15,460 --> 04:54:17,460
Where's Moomin?

4839
04:54:17,460 --> 04:54:19,460
He's in bed.

4840
04:54:19,460 --> 04:54:21,460
Moomin's still asleep.

4841
04:54:21,460 --> 04:54:23,460
A sleep.

4842
04:54:31,460 --> 04:54:34,460
They won't wake up no matter what you do.

4843
04:54:34,460 --> 04:54:37,460
What do you think, Snuffkin?

4844
04:54:37,460 --> 04:54:39,460
I think they're very sick.

4845
04:54:39,460 --> 04:54:41,460
That's a possibility.

4846
04:54:41,460 --> 04:54:43,460
Sleeping sickness, perhaps?

4847
04:54:43,460 --> 04:54:45,460
It's very difficult to say.

4848
04:54:45,460 --> 04:54:47,460
To me, though, if you want my honest opinion,

4849
04:54:47,460 --> 04:54:50,460
I think somebody has cast a very nasty spell on them.

4850
04:54:50,460 --> 04:54:52,460
A spell?

4851
04:54:52,460 --> 04:54:54,460
But who would do that?

4852
04:54:54,460 --> 04:54:56,460
I think I know.

4853
04:54:56,460 --> 04:54:57,460
Huh?

4854
04:54:57,460 --> 04:54:58,460
You mean the witch?

4855
04:54:58,460 --> 04:55:00,460
Alice is grandmother, but why?

4856
04:55:00,460 --> 04:55:03,460
To tell you the truth, I haven't the biggest idea.

4857
04:55:03,460 --> 04:55:06,460
How do we find out?

4858
04:55:06,460 --> 04:55:09,460
I'll go to the forest and see her.

4859
04:55:09,460 --> 04:55:12,460
And if she did cast a spell, do you think she'd tell you?

4860
04:55:12,460 --> 04:55:15,460
I really don't know, but we have to do something.

4861
04:55:15,460 --> 04:55:18,460
We can't just leave them sleeping here forever.

4862
04:55:18,460 --> 04:55:20,460
I'll go with you.

4863
04:55:20,460 --> 04:55:23,460
I guess I'd better stay here to take care of things.

4864
04:55:23,460 --> 04:55:27,460
Well, if they suddenly wake up, somebody needs to be here.

4865
04:55:27,460 --> 04:55:29,460
Snuffkin.

4866
04:55:29,460 --> 04:55:30,460
Huh?

4867
04:55:30,460 --> 04:55:31,460
That's him!

4868
04:55:31,460 --> 04:55:32,460
At last!

4869
04:55:32,460 --> 04:55:33,460
Moomin!

4870
04:55:33,460 --> 04:55:34,460
Moomin!

4871
04:55:34,460 --> 04:55:35,460
Moomin!

4872
04:55:37,460 --> 04:55:39,460
He's dreaming.

4873
04:55:39,460 --> 04:55:42,460
It makes me feel sleepy.

4874
04:55:43,460 --> 04:55:48,460
Moomin, I promise to get this horrible spell cast off for you.

4875
04:56:10,460 --> 04:56:12,460
Hush.

4876
04:56:23,460 --> 04:56:25,460
Where are you going?

4877
04:56:25,460 --> 04:56:29,460
I've done all the chores, even washed out your old potion jars.

4878
04:56:29,460 --> 04:56:31,460
So where are you going?

4879
04:56:31,460 --> 04:56:32,460
Spring is here, Grandma.

4880
04:56:32,460 --> 04:56:35,460
I thought I'd take some time off to celebrate.

4881
04:56:35,460 --> 04:56:37,460
But what about your work?

4882
04:56:37,460 --> 04:56:40,460
I'm just going out for the day, Grandma.

4883
04:56:40,460 --> 04:56:42,460
And I know where.

4884
04:56:42,460 --> 04:56:44,460
I only want to see the Moomin's.

4885
04:56:44,460 --> 04:56:45,460
They're still hibernating.

4886
04:56:45,460 --> 04:56:46,460
No, they're not.

4887
04:56:46,460 --> 04:56:48,460
It isn't winter anymore.

4888
04:56:48,460 --> 04:56:52,460
Winter or spring, I happen to know the Moomin's are still asleep.

4889
04:56:52,460 --> 04:56:55,460
How could you know what the Moomin's are up to, Grandma?

4890
04:56:55,460 --> 04:56:56,460
Hm.

4891
04:56:56,460 --> 04:56:58,460
Oh, which is no everything, my dear girl.

4892
04:56:58,460 --> 04:56:59,460
Really?

4893
04:56:59,460 --> 04:57:01,460
Well, I'll go and see.

4894
04:57:01,460 --> 04:57:03,460
Come here.

4895
04:57:08,460 --> 04:57:13,460
I have to admit that I can't help being worried about the Moomin's.

4896
04:57:13,460 --> 04:57:16,460
Their windows are open for the spring.

4897
04:57:16,460 --> 04:57:19,460
So they can smell the first spring flowers?

4898
04:57:19,460 --> 04:57:23,460
Well, I suppose I'd miss beginning on.

4899
04:57:27,460 --> 04:57:30,460
Why didn't you tell them about the witch in the spell?

4900
04:57:30,460 --> 04:57:33,460
Well, after all, that was just an idea I got.

4901
04:57:33,460 --> 04:57:36,460
Ideas can be embarrassing if you were wrong.

4902
04:57:36,460 --> 04:57:39,460
So don't tell anyone for the time being.

4903
04:57:39,460 --> 04:57:40,460
All right.

4904
04:57:40,460 --> 04:57:41,460
I'm going.

4905
04:57:43,460 --> 04:57:45,460
And I'm leaving, too.

4906
04:57:45,460 --> 04:57:46,460
Okay.

4907
04:57:51,460 --> 04:57:53,460
There's Alicia.

4908
04:57:53,460 --> 04:57:55,460
Hi, everyone.

4909
04:57:55,460 --> 04:57:56,460
It's me.

4910
04:57:56,460 --> 04:57:58,460
Why do you get a teller?

4911
04:57:58,460 --> 04:58:01,460
We better tell of the truth, I guess.

4912
04:58:07,460 --> 04:58:10,460
The best thing would be for me to talk to her first.

4913
04:58:10,460 --> 04:58:11,460
Yes, I agree.

4914
04:58:11,460 --> 04:58:13,460
She's unbelievable.

4915
04:58:13,460 --> 04:58:14,460
How could she?

4916
04:58:17,460 --> 04:58:20,460
I can hardly believe you could be so mean, Grandma.

4917
04:58:20,460 --> 04:58:22,460
Calm down, my dear.

4918
04:58:22,460 --> 04:58:25,460
Why did it all for you, Alicia?

4919
04:58:25,460 --> 04:58:27,460
You did it for me.

4920
04:58:27,460 --> 04:58:29,460
If the Moomin's are asleep, why should you go there?

4921
04:58:29,460 --> 04:58:32,460
Do them a world of good, too, along sleep.

4922
04:58:32,460 --> 04:58:34,460
How ridiculous, Grandma, there.

4923
04:58:34,460 --> 04:58:37,460
Alicia, you've done quite well in your studies, and if you keep at it,

4924
04:58:37,460 --> 04:58:42,460
I see no reason why you shouldn't be a fully fledged witch before a 30.

4925
04:58:43,460 --> 04:58:46,460
And if I do see the Moomin's, I won't be a witch till I'm 31.

4926
04:58:46,460 --> 04:58:47,460
Is that what you mean?

4927
04:58:47,460 --> 04:58:50,460
Now, the Moomin's are very bad influence on you.

4928
04:58:50,460 --> 04:58:55,460
They are so disgustingly good, and if you want to be a witch, you mustn't see them.

4929
04:58:59,460 --> 04:59:02,460
And if I promise never to go near Moomin Valley again,

4930
04:59:02,460 --> 04:59:04,460
will you lift the spell, Grandma?

4931
04:59:04,460 --> 04:59:07,460
Good girl, that's exactly what I wanted here.

4932
04:59:07,460 --> 04:59:09,460
You promise me, Dan, Alicia?

4933
04:59:09,460 --> 04:59:10,460
I promise, Grandma.

4934
04:59:10,460 --> 04:59:12,460
Right, the spell should be lifted.

4935
04:59:12,460 --> 04:59:13,460
Snuff head.

4936
04:59:13,460 --> 04:59:14,460
What do you want?

4937
04:59:14,460 --> 04:59:17,460
There are two different ways of lifting the spell I cast on the Moomin's.

4938
04:59:17,460 --> 04:59:18,460
Uh-huh.

4939
04:59:18,460 --> 04:59:22,460
The first one is that I go to Moomin Valley myself and chant the magic words

4940
04:59:22,460 --> 04:59:24,460
outside their bedroom window.

4941
04:59:24,460 --> 04:59:26,460
Oh, Grandma, that's not a good idea.

4942
04:59:26,460 --> 04:59:31,460
Oh, oh, you mean people who might be upset about me casting a spell on the Moomin's?

4943
04:59:31,460 --> 04:59:33,460
You may be right.

4944
04:59:33,460 --> 04:59:37,460
So therefore, Snuff Kid, I have no choice but to ask you to perform the task.

4945
04:59:37,460 --> 04:59:38,460
Oh.

4946
04:59:38,460 --> 04:59:39,460
But why me?

4947
04:59:39,460 --> 04:59:41,460
You do have your harmonica with you?

4948
04:59:41,460 --> 04:59:42,460
Of course.

4949
04:59:42,460 --> 04:59:44,460
Let me have it, please.

4950
04:59:48,460 --> 04:59:49,460
Eldish Cabalasome.

4951
04:59:49,460 --> 04:59:50,460
Eldish Cabalasome.

4952
04:59:50,460 --> 04:59:51,460
Eldish Cabalasome.

4953
04:59:51,460 --> 04:59:52,460
Eldish Cabalasome.

4954
04:59:52,460 --> 04:59:53,460
Eldish Cabalasome.

4955
04:59:53,460 --> 04:59:58,460
If you don't stop staring at me, my witchcraft won't be effective.

4956
04:59:59,460 --> 05:00:01,460
Alicia, get me the next potion now.

4957
05:00:01,460 --> 05:00:02,460
Oh.

4958
05:00:03,460 --> 05:00:04,460
Oh.

4959
05:00:04,460 --> 05:00:06,460
All right, grandmother.

4960
05:00:10,460 --> 05:00:11,460
Eldish Cabalasome.

4961
05:00:11,460 --> 05:00:12,460
Eldish Cabalasome.

4962
05:00:12,460 --> 05:00:13,460
Eldish Cabalasome.

4963
05:00:13,460 --> 05:00:14,460
Eldish Cabalasome.

4964
05:00:14,460 --> 05:00:16,460
Oh, she can't do it if we look at her, huh?

4965
05:00:16,460 --> 05:00:17,460
Eldish Cabalasome.

4966
05:00:17,460 --> 05:00:18,460
Eldish Cabalasome.

4967
05:00:18,460 --> 05:00:20,460
Now, listen, Inspector.

4968
05:00:20,460 --> 05:00:21,460
You must do something.

4969
05:00:21,460 --> 05:00:23,460
You are the police, aren't you?

4970
05:00:23,460 --> 05:00:27,460
Well, I have to tell you, waking people up is not really part of our job.

4971
05:00:27,460 --> 05:00:29,460
But you're our last hope, Inspector.

4972
05:00:29,460 --> 05:00:31,460
You must do something.

4973
05:00:31,460 --> 05:00:34,460
Perhaps if you could possibly use your whistle to wake them up.

4974
05:00:34,460 --> 05:00:35,460
Uh-huh.

4975
05:00:35,460 --> 05:00:37,460
It's very shrill indoors. Good Friday.

4976
05:00:37,460 --> 05:00:39,460
And fire your revolver.

4977
05:00:39,460 --> 05:00:41,460
I'm sure that would do it, Inspector.

4978
05:00:41,460 --> 05:00:44,460
I don't carry guns. They're dangerous.

4979
05:00:44,460 --> 05:00:46,460
Oh, dear.

4980
05:00:51,460 --> 05:00:52,460
Hey!

4981
05:00:52,460 --> 05:00:53,460
Snuffkin!

4982
05:00:53,460 --> 05:00:55,460
Little Y!

4983
05:00:55,460 --> 05:00:58,460
He sounds worried. I bet they're still fast asleep.

4984
05:00:58,460 --> 05:00:59,460
Hmm.

4985
05:01:03,460 --> 05:01:04,460
Right, Snuffkin?

4986
05:01:04,460 --> 05:01:05,460
Get on with it.

4987
05:01:06,460 --> 05:01:07,460
Hmm.

4988
05:01:07,460 --> 05:01:09,460
Hmm.

4989
05:01:17,460 --> 05:01:18,460
Hmm.

4990
05:01:18,460 --> 05:01:20,460
Hmm.

4991
05:01:20,460 --> 05:01:22,460
Hmm.

4992
05:01:22,460 --> 05:01:23,460
Hmm.

4993
05:01:23,460 --> 05:01:24,460
Hmm.

4994
05:01:24,460 --> 05:01:25,460
It's not working. Is it?

4995
05:01:25,460 --> 05:01:27,460
Get my chance, Snuffkin.

4996
05:01:27,460 --> 05:01:28,460
Hmm.

4997
05:01:28,460 --> 05:01:30,460
Hmm.

4998
05:01:30,460 --> 05:01:33,460
Hmm.

4999
05:01:33,460 --> 05:01:34,460
Hmm.

5000
05:01:34,460 --> 05:01:44,460
Snorke! Snorke, Maiden! Wake up! Spring is here! Come on!

5001
05:01:54,460 --> 05:01:56,460
Spring is here already!

5002
05:01:56,460 --> 05:01:58,460
Good morning, Papa, dear!

5003
05:01:58,460 --> 05:02:00,460
Good morning!

5004
05:02:00,460 --> 05:02:04,460
I have a feeling we've over slept. I wonder whether the others are up yet.

5005
05:02:04,460 --> 05:02:08,460
Oh, she's made a fool of you, Snorke!

5006
05:02:08,460 --> 05:02:12,460
Oh, shut up, Snorke! Maybe she forgot how to cast off the spell!

5007
05:02:12,460 --> 05:02:14,460
Hi, Snorke! Hi!

5008
05:02:14,460 --> 05:02:16,460
Good morning!

5009
05:02:18,460 --> 05:02:20,460
Good morning, everybody!

5010
05:02:20,460 --> 05:02:22,460
Hi, Snorke!

5011
05:02:24,460 --> 05:02:28,460
I'm so glad you were right back already, Snorke!

5012
05:02:28,460 --> 05:02:32,460
You woke up early, too! Did you hear that?

5013
05:02:32,460 --> 05:02:34,460
It's you that woke up late, women!

5014
05:02:34,460 --> 05:02:36,460
Who me?

5015
05:02:40,460 --> 05:02:42,460
Hmm? Ah!

5016
05:02:42,460 --> 05:02:46,460
Now I say, women's all ready up and about!

5017
05:02:46,460 --> 05:02:48,460
What?

5018
05:02:48,460 --> 05:02:50,460
Oh, hi, Snorke!

5019
05:02:50,460 --> 05:02:52,460
Oh, it's you, you're awake!

5020
05:02:52,460 --> 05:02:54,460
I'm glad I didn't blow my whistle!

5021
05:02:54,460 --> 05:02:56,460
But we did have a reason to be worried, Inspector!

5022
05:02:56,460 --> 05:02:58,460
He's right! What about Mom and Mama?

5023
05:02:58,460 --> 05:03:00,460
And Mom and Papa?

5024
05:03:00,460 --> 05:03:02,460
Hello there, everybody!

5025
05:03:02,460 --> 05:03:04,460
Is anything the matter?

5026
05:03:04,460 --> 05:03:06,460
Nothing at all!

5027
05:03:06,460 --> 05:03:08,460
They're awake! Oh, dear! I don't understand!

5028
05:03:08,460 --> 05:03:10,460
You don't understand what?

5029
05:03:10,460 --> 05:03:14,460
We were very worried because you just wouldn't wake up!

5030
05:03:14,460 --> 05:03:16,460
Oh, really? You do know we always have a night, don't you?

5031
05:03:16,460 --> 05:03:18,460
We sleep all winter, and we always wake up in the spring!

5032
05:03:18,460 --> 05:03:22,460
Of course, of course, but this year, Snorke, you're telling!

5033
05:03:22,460 --> 05:03:24,460
Well, we did have a bit of a problem!

5034
05:03:24,460 --> 05:03:26,460
You see, Mom and Papa, we couldn't swim!

5035
05:03:26,460 --> 05:03:28,460
Snorke!

5036
05:03:28,460 --> 05:03:30,460
Back already!

5037
05:03:30,460 --> 05:03:32,460
Why don't you listen to us, Mom and Papa?

5038
05:03:32,460 --> 05:03:34,460
Very well!

5039
05:03:34,460 --> 05:03:36,460
Why don't you come in and we'll have a nice cup of tea,

5040
05:03:36,460 --> 05:03:38,460
and then we can discuss your problem properly!

5041
05:03:38,460 --> 05:03:40,460
But it's your problem, I'm afraid!

5042
05:03:40,460 --> 05:03:42,460
Not ours!

5043
05:03:42,460 --> 05:03:44,460
What does he mean?

5044
05:03:44,460 --> 05:03:46,460
We don't have a problem, do we?

5045
05:03:46,460 --> 05:03:48,460
Please do come in anyway, everybody!

5046
05:03:48,460 --> 05:03:50,460
Please!

5047
05:03:50,460 --> 05:03:51,460
You too! All of you come in!

5048
05:03:51,460 --> 05:03:53,460
Come in, everybody!

5049
05:03:55,460 --> 05:03:57,460
Move aside! I'm in Georgia!

5050
05:04:07,460 --> 05:04:09,460
Whatever happened was this year!

5051
05:04:09,460 --> 05:04:11,460
Hey, Snorke!

5052
05:04:15,460 --> 05:04:17,460
Alicia!

5053
05:04:21,460 --> 05:04:23,460
Mom!

5054
05:04:23,460 --> 05:04:25,460
We've come to see you, Alicia!

5055
05:04:25,460 --> 05:04:27,460
That was nice of you!

5056
05:04:29,460 --> 05:04:31,460
Your grandmother isn't home, is she?

5057
05:04:31,460 --> 05:04:33,460
No! Then we can play hide and seek!

5058
05:04:33,460 --> 05:04:35,460
I can't!

5059
05:04:35,460 --> 05:04:37,460
I promised Grandma there!

5060
05:04:37,460 --> 05:04:39,460
Yes, I know, Snorke can tell me!

5061
05:04:39,460 --> 05:04:41,460
That was a really great thing to do!

5062
05:04:41,460 --> 05:04:43,460
But you didn't promise not to see us!

5063
05:04:43,460 --> 05:04:45,460
You just promised not to go to Mom and Valley, didn't you?

5064
05:04:45,460 --> 05:04:47,460
Yeah!

5065
05:04:47,460 --> 05:04:49,460
And listen, you never promised not to play with us either, did you?

5066
05:04:49,460 --> 05:04:51,460
No!

5067
05:04:51,460 --> 05:04:53,460
So, if we came here to see you instead of you to us,

5068
05:04:53,460 --> 05:04:55,460
then it's alright!

5069
05:04:55,460 --> 05:04:57,460
And you don't have to break your promise!

5070
05:04:57,460 --> 05:04:59,460
Oh! I suppose so!

5071
05:04:59,460 --> 05:05:01,460
Yes, I suppose you're right!

5072
05:05:01,460 --> 05:05:03,460
Well, let's play!

5073
05:05:03,460 --> 05:05:05,460
Yeah!

5074
05:05:05,460 --> 05:05:11,460
13, 4, 7, 5, 8!

5075
05:05:11,460 --> 05:05:13,460
Oh!

5076
05:05:25,460 --> 05:05:29,460
That afternoon, they all had the most wonderful time playing hide and seek in the woods!

5077
05:05:29,460 --> 05:05:31,460
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

5078
05:05:31,460 --> 05:05:35,460
I'm Jule!

5079
05:05:35,460 --> 05:05:37,460
Three!

5080
05:05:37,460 --> 05:05:39,460
Your titties are!

5081
05:05:39,460 --> 05:05:41,460
Five!

5082
05:05:41,460 --> 05:05:43,460
Six!

5083
05:05:43,460 --> 05:05:45,460
Seven!

5084
05:05:45,460 --> 05:05:47,460
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

5085
05:05:47,460 --> 05:05:49,460
Nine!

5086
05:05:49,460 --> 05:05:51,460
Ten!

5087
05:05:51,460 --> 05:05:53,460
Eleven!

5088
05:05:57,460 --> 05:06:03,460
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements!

5089
05:06:03,460 --> 05:06:11,460
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements!

5090
05:06:11,460 --> 05:06:15,460
They're always happy and goes at play!

5091
05:06:15,460 --> 05:06:19,460
The Moons are having fun day after day!

5092
05:06:19,460 --> 05:06:21,460
The Moons!

5093
05:06:21,460 --> 05:06:25,460
The Moons!

5094
05:06:25,460 --> 05:06:29,460
The Moons!

5095
05:06:29,460 --> 05:06:33,460
The Moons!

5096
05:06:33,460 --> 05:06:35,460
The Moons!

5097
05:06:35,460 --> 05:06:39,460
The Moons!

5098
05:06:39,460 --> 05:06:41,460
The Moons!

5099
05:06:41,460 --> 05:06:45,460
The Moons!

5100
05:06:45,460 --> 05:06:49,460
The Moons!

5101
05:06:49,460 --> 05:06:53,460
The Moons!

5102
05:06:53,460 --> 05:06:57,460
Here they are for one and all!

5103
05:06:57,460 --> 05:07:01,460
The Moons are about to call!

5104
05:07:01,460 --> 05:07:03,460
Come on and sit down here with me!

5105
05:07:03,460 --> 05:07:05,460
They're here for you on your TV!

5106
05:07:05,460 --> 05:07:09,460
They are the movements!

5107
05:07:09,460 --> 05:07:11,460
They are the movements!

5108
05:07:11,460 --> 05:07:13,460
So come with me!

5109
05:07:13,460 --> 05:07:15,460
Give me your hand!

5110
05:07:15,460 --> 05:07:17,460
I'll take you up to a moment land!

5111
05:07:17,460 --> 05:07:21,460
You can fly just like a bird!

5112
05:07:21,460 --> 05:07:23,460
Sing that song ever!

5113
05:07:23,460 --> 05:07:25,460
There were the movements!

5114
05:07:25,460 --> 05:07:31,460
There were the movements!

5115
05:07:31,460 --> 05:07:35,460
There were the movement!

5116
05:07:35,460 --> 05:07:37,460
There were the movements!

5117
05:07:37,460 --> 05:07:41,460
There were the movements!

5118
05:07:55,460 --> 05:08:03,460
Big explosions could be heard in Mumen Valley almost every night and Mumen couldn't sleep a wink.

5119
05:08:03,460 --> 05:08:07,460
Usually there was just one, but sometimes even two.

5120
05:08:11,460 --> 05:08:13,460
You heard it too, Mumen, papa.

5121
05:08:13,460 --> 05:08:16,460
Yes, those loud bangs are keeping me awake.

5122
05:08:16,460 --> 05:08:18,460
I wonder if there'll be another one.

5123
05:08:21,460 --> 05:08:23,460
They seem to be coming from the north.

5124
05:08:23,460 --> 05:08:25,460
Hmm, he's tired, though.

5125
05:08:25,460 --> 05:08:27,460
Or they could be coming from lonely mountains.

5126
05:08:27,460 --> 05:08:31,460
If you ask me, I believe they're the work of the witch.

5127
05:08:31,460 --> 05:08:34,460
The witch? But witches don't make a lot of noise.

5128
05:08:34,460 --> 05:08:37,460
Never know. They're sneaky characters.

5129
05:08:37,460 --> 05:08:40,460
Tomorrow I'll have a few words with the inspector.

5130
05:08:40,460 --> 05:08:42,460
It's up to him to put a stop to it.

5131
05:08:42,460 --> 05:08:45,460
Papa, why would the witch want to make explosions?

5132
05:08:45,460 --> 05:08:46,460
Why not?

5133
05:08:46,460 --> 05:08:50,460
The first bang wakes me up and then I lie awake waiting for the second one,

5134
05:08:50,460 --> 05:08:52,460
which might not come at all.

5135
05:08:52,460 --> 05:08:55,460
The bangs might not come from Mumen Valley at all,

5136
05:08:55,460 --> 05:08:57,460
and they might be just an echo off the mountains.

5137
05:08:57,460 --> 05:08:58,460
You think so?

5138
05:08:58,460 --> 05:08:59,460
Yes, I do.

5139
05:08:59,460 --> 05:09:01,460
Well, at least that's what Snuffkin thinks.

5140
05:09:01,460 --> 05:09:03,460
I mean, the explosions might come from the sea.

5141
05:09:03,460 --> 05:09:05,460
That's what Snuffkin figured.

5142
05:09:05,460 --> 05:09:08,460
He thought it might be pirates or something making the noises.

5143
05:09:08,460 --> 05:09:11,460
He's already had pirates and they went a long time ago.

5144
05:09:11,460 --> 05:09:13,460
I'm plumping for the witch.

5145
05:09:13,460 --> 05:09:14,460
There's no doubt in my mind.

5146
05:09:14,460 --> 05:09:16,460
Goodness, what are you doing out here?

5147
05:09:16,460 --> 05:09:18,460
We're waiting for another explosion, Mama.

5148
05:09:18,460 --> 05:09:20,460
You'll wait in vain, dear.

5149
05:09:20,460 --> 05:09:22,460
Who do you know that moment, Mama?

5150
05:09:22,460 --> 05:09:24,460
Well, we had two explosions last night,

5151
05:09:24,460 --> 05:09:28,460
and we've never had double explosions for two nights in a row.

5152
05:09:29,460 --> 05:09:31,460
Until now, that is.

5153
05:09:31,460 --> 05:09:32,460
You heard that.

5154
05:09:32,460 --> 05:09:34,460
It clearly came from over there.

5155
05:09:34,460 --> 05:09:35,460
Over there?

5156
05:09:35,460 --> 05:09:37,460
Oh, no. It certainly came from over there.

5157
05:09:37,460 --> 05:09:39,460
You couldn't mistake it.

5158
05:09:39,460 --> 05:09:41,460
I'm sure of it.

5159
05:09:51,460 --> 05:09:53,460
Good morning, Moomin, lovely day.

5160
05:09:53,460 --> 05:09:54,460
Morning, Snuffkin.

5161
05:09:54,460 --> 05:09:55,460
You look very sleepy.

5162
05:09:55,460 --> 05:09:57,460
So would you be a close explosion

5163
05:09:57,460 --> 05:09:59,460
that kept you awake for most of the night?

5164
05:09:59,460 --> 05:10:02,460
Those explosions are really very hard, aren't they?

5165
05:10:02,460 --> 05:10:03,460
They certainly are.

5166
05:10:03,460 --> 05:10:06,460
Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?

5167
05:10:06,460 --> 05:10:09,460
Moomin, Puppers, convinced that she's the one

5168
05:10:09,460 --> 05:10:10,460
who's making the bangs.

5169
05:10:10,460 --> 05:10:11,460
I think he's wrong there.

5170
05:10:11,460 --> 05:10:12,460
That's what I thought.

5171
05:10:12,460 --> 05:10:15,460
But there's nothing I could say to convince him.

5172
05:10:15,460 --> 05:10:18,460
So now I'm going to find out what he's doing.

5173
05:10:18,460 --> 05:10:21,460
So now I'm going to find out for myself.

5174
05:10:21,460 --> 05:10:22,460
You can certainly ask her,

5175
05:10:22,460 --> 05:10:25,460
but do you really trust a witch to tell you the truth?

5176
05:10:27,460 --> 05:10:28,460
Do you, Moomin?

5177
05:10:28,460 --> 05:10:31,460
But witches don't have to lie, Shirley.

5178
05:10:39,460 --> 05:10:41,460
Is that you, Little My?

5179
05:10:43,460 --> 05:10:45,460
And where are you two going?

5180
05:10:45,460 --> 05:10:46,460
Little My.

5181
05:10:46,460 --> 05:10:48,460
Are you tailing me full-time or what?

5182
05:10:48,460 --> 05:10:51,460
Yes, whenever you're sneaking off somewhere,

5183
05:10:51,460 --> 05:10:53,460
I'm not sneaking. I'm just walking.

5184
05:10:53,460 --> 05:10:57,460
Well, I've never seen anyone walking in such a sneaky way.

5185
05:11:01,460 --> 05:11:05,460
Last time the witch tried to keep you from waking up, didn't she?

5186
05:11:05,460 --> 05:11:06,460
So...

5187
05:11:06,460 --> 05:11:09,460
So you think now she's trying to keep you from sleeping?

5188
05:11:09,460 --> 05:11:11,460
Well, if she makes the explosions,

5189
05:11:11,460 --> 05:11:14,460
it's always possible that someone else is the target.

5190
05:11:14,460 --> 05:11:16,460
We know very little about witches,

5191
05:11:16,460 --> 05:11:19,460
and those bangs are probably nothing to do with the Moomons.

5192
05:11:20,460 --> 05:11:22,460
I think you guessed right,

5193
05:11:22,460 --> 05:11:24,460
but try telling that to the Moomons.

5194
05:11:24,460 --> 05:11:26,460
We don't think it's like that at all.

5195
05:11:32,460 --> 05:11:34,460
Wonder if she's at home.

5196
05:11:34,460 --> 05:11:36,460
If she isn't, we can visit Alicia instead.

5197
05:11:36,460 --> 05:11:38,460
Better ask Alicia than the witch.

5198
05:11:38,460 --> 05:11:40,460
Anyway, she's more likely to tell us the truth.

5199
05:11:40,460 --> 05:11:42,460
Yes, you're right.

5200
05:11:45,460 --> 05:11:47,460
Oh, oh, oh.

5201
05:11:50,460 --> 05:11:53,460
Look, you don't seem to realize this is a witch's house.

5202
05:11:53,460 --> 05:11:55,460
What do you mean by that?

5203
05:11:55,460 --> 05:11:57,460
I'll tell you what I mean.

5204
05:11:57,460 --> 05:12:01,460
What I mean is I don't want to be seen talking with goody-goodies like the Moomons.

5205
05:12:01,460 --> 05:12:03,460
You think they'll ruin your reputation,

5206
05:12:03,460 --> 05:12:05,460
is that why you're so worried?

5207
05:12:08,460 --> 05:12:11,460
There's just something very important we wanted to ask you.

5208
05:12:12,460 --> 05:12:14,460
And then we'll leave straight away.

5209
05:12:20,460 --> 05:12:23,460
That room upstairs, is that Alicia's?

5210
05:12:23,460 --> 05:12:24,460
It is.

5211
05:12:24,460 --> 05:12:26,460
Is Alicia there now?

5212
05:12:26,460 --> 05:12:27,460
No, she isn't.

5213
05:12:27,460 --> 05:12:28,460
Where did she go?

5214
05:12:28,460 --> 05:12:30,460
She went to get some wolf's vein.

5215
05:12:30,460 --> 05:12:31,460
When will she be coming back?

5216
05:12:31,460 --> 05:12:33,460
You're not going to stop her studying.

5217
05:12:34,460 --> 05:12:35,460
No.

5218
05:12:35,460 --> 05:12:39,460
We wanted to ask her something about that loud noise we hear every night.

5219
05:12:40,460 --> 05:12:41,460
Ah, that one.

5220
05:12:41,460 --> 05:12:44,460
Hey, are you the one making the bangs?

5221
05:12:44,460 --> 05:12:46,460
I don't make explosions.

5222
05:12:46,460 --> 05:12:47,460
Who is it then?

5223
05:12:47,460 --> 05:12:49,460
I really don't know.

5224
05:12:49,460 --> 05:12:51,460
But why did you say that one then?

5225
05:12:51,460 --> 05:12:53,460
Because the explosions bother me, too.

5226
05:12:54,460 --> 05:12:56,460
You think they're coming from near here?

5227
05:12:56,460 --> 05:12:59,460
I think they're coming from far away from the sea, maybe.

5228
05:12:59,460 --> 05:13:01,460
That's what snuffkin' things, too.

5229
05:13:01,460 --> 05:13:04,460
Any sound from the sea echoes off Lonely Mountain,

5230
05:13:04,460 --> 05:13:06,460
so you think that's where it comes from?

5231
05:13:06,460 --> 05:13:08,460
Why is young man a few days ago?

5232
05:13:08,460 --> 05:13:11,460
I went all the way over to the beach to see what was happening.

5233
05:13:11,460 --> 05:13:14,460
After a whole day's witching and casting magic spells,

5234
05:13:14,460 --> 05:13:16,460
one needs one sleep, you know.

5235
05:13:16,460 --> 05:13:18,460
So, what did you find them?

5236
05:13:18,460 --> 05:13:19,460
Nothing at all.

5237
05:13:19,460 --> 05:13:21,460
There was only one explosion that night,

5238
05:13:21,460 --> 05:13:24,460
so when I got there on my brunt, there was nothing more to see.

5239
05:13:24,460 --> 05:13:27,460
Then we still have no idea who makes the bangs.

5240
05:13:27,460 --> 05:13:30,460
No, and I really upset you thought it was me.

5241
05:13:30,460 --> 05:13:32,460
When a witch creates an explosion,

5242
05:13:32,460 --> 05:13:34,460
it doesn't sound anything like a camel cough.

5243
05:13:34,460 --> 05:13:36,460
I can tell you.

5244
05:13:36,460 --> 05:13:38,460
Camel cough, I like that.

5245
05:13:38,460 --> 05:13:40,460
Camel cough, I like that.

5246
05:13:54,460 --> 05:13:56,460
Thank you very much, Snort Maiden.

5247
05:13:58,460 --> 05:14:01,460
This year I want to grow some black tulips.

5248
05:14:01,460 --> 05:14:04,460
Is there really such a thing as a black tulip?

5249
05:14:04,460 --> 05:14:06,460
There's such a dark red, they look black.

5250
05:14:06,460 --> 05:14:07,460
Oh, I see.

5251
05:14:07,460 --> 05:14:10,460
Although it wouldn't really surprise me, Snort Maiden,

5252
05:14:10,460 --> 05:14:12,460
if there really were black ones somewhere.

5253
05:14:12,460 --> 05:14:14,460
We must ask the hamulineal now.

5254
05:14:14,460 --> 05:14:16,460
Oh, yes.

5255
05:14:16,460 --> 05:14:19,460
I know it's embarrassing, but I'm so excited.

5256
05:14:19,460 --> 05:14:21,460
I can't go to sleep at night.

5257
05:14:21,460 --> 05:14:23,460
Oh, I have no problem going to sleep at night,

5258
05:14:23,460 --> 05:14:25,460
but that noise wakes me up, Pamuline.

5259
05:14:25,460 --> 05:14:26,460
What noise is that?

5260
05:14:26,460 --> 05:14:28,460
I told you that noise.

5261
05:14:29,460 --> 05:14:30,460
Oh, I see.

5262
05:14:30,460 --> 05:14:32,460
You're talking about the explosion.

5263
05:14:32,460 --> 05:14:34,460
You know anything about it, Mr. Hamuline?

5264
05:14:34,460 --> 05:14:36,460
No, nothing at all.

5265
05:14:36,460 --> 05:14:39,460
No, those bangs are not what keeps me awake,

5266
05:14:39,460 --> 05:14:41,460
moment papa.

5267
05:14:41,460 --> 05:14:44,460
No, I'm waiting for a pie from the botanist federation.

5268
05:14:44,460 --> 05:14:45,460
Reply?

5269
05:14:45,460 --> 05:14:48,460
Yes, don't you remember a few months ago?

5270
05:14:48,460 --> 05:14:51,460
Pouse range, I thought I told you about it.

5271
05:14:51,460 --> 05:14:53,460
Well, I certainly told everyone else I know.

5272
05:14:53,460 --> 05:14:56,460
I sent them a brand new species.

5273
05:14:57,460 --> 05:14:58,460
New species?

5274
05:14:58,460 --> 05:15:01,460
I'd never seen anything like it in my whole life.

5275
05:15:01,460 --> 05:15:05,460
A new wild orchid, I'm so excited I can hardly speak.

5276
05:15:05,460 --> 05:15:06,460
Really?

5277
05:15:06,460 --> 05:15:09,460
A new wild orchid, how very interesting.

5278
05:15:09,460 --> 05:15:10,460
Yes, isn't it?

5279
05:15:10,460 --> 05:15:13,460
Oh, it would be such a great honor for me and for everyone else

5280
05:15:13,460 --> 05:15:16,460
if they called it Orkydaka-Hemulensis or Himila Formis.

5281
05:15:16,460 --> 05:15:18,460
No, I'm sure they will.

5282
05:15:18,460 --> 05:15:22,460
So now you understand why I've had so many sleepless nights.

5283
05:15:22,460 --> 05:15:24,460
Yes, indeed.

5284
05:15:24,460 --> 05:15:26,460
The trouble is they should have answered by now.

5285
05:15:26,460 --> 05:15:29,460
Maybe they're still trying to decide what to call it.

5286
05:15:29,460 --> 05:15:32,460
Maybe they can't decide between Orkydaka-Hemulensis

5287
05:15:32,460 --> 05:15:35,460
and Orkydaka-Hemila Formis.

5288
05:15:35,460 --> 05:15:36,460
Hmm.

5289
05:15:36,460 --> 05:15:37,460
Oh.

5290
05:15:37,460 --> 05:15:39,460
What is it?

5291
05:15:39,460 --> 05:15:42,460
Now I see, at last I understand.

5292
05:15:42,460 --> 05:15:45,460
I am getting no reply from the botanist federation

5293
05:15:45,460 --> 05:15:48,460
because it is not a new species.

5294
05:15:48,460 --> 05:15:52,460
Of course, somebody's already found it.

5295
05:15:52,460 --> 05:15:53,460
Oh.

5296
05:15:53,460 --> 05:15:55,460
This is really funny.

5297
05:15:55,460 --> 05:15:59,460
I'm stupid of him.

5298
05:15:59,460 --> 05:16:03,460
This is the end of me as a scientist, of course.

5299
05:16:03,460 --> 05:16:06,460
Calm down, don't upset yourself, Mr. Himulens.

5300
05:16:06,460 --> 05:16:10,460
Everybody will laugh at me and call me Mr. Himulensis.

5301
05:16:10,460 --> 05:16:14,460
Now listen, Mr. Himulens, the reply is a long time coming

5302
05:16:14,460 --> 05:16:17,460
because they must examine your plant most carefully

5303
05:16:17,460 --> 05:16:19,460
before making a decision.

5304
05:16:19,460 --> 05:16:23,460
You must read all the books first to be sure.

5305
05:16:23,460 --> 05:16:27,460
You really think so, Mum and Batman?

5306
05:16:27,460 --> 05:16:29,460
Could it really take so long, do you think?

5307
05:16:29,460 --> 05:16:31,460
Of course, these things take time.

5308
05:16:31,460 --> 05:16:33,460
When did you send it off?

5309
05:16:33,460 --> 05:16:34,460
A month ago.

5310
05:16:34,460 --> 05:16:37,460
Oh, there you are, that's no time at all.

5311
05:16:37,460 --> 05:16:39,460
You have to learn to be patient, Emulensis.

5312
05:16:39,460 --> 05:16:40,460
You think so?

5313
05:16:40,460 --> 05:16:42,460
Oh, I feel better already.

5314
05:16:42,460 --> 05:16:44,460
Oh, I'm so glad you feel happier, Mr. Himulens.

5315
05:16:44,460 --> 05:16:46,460
Don't you worry, my friend.

5316
05:16:46,460 --> 05:16:48,460
Mama, great news dear.

5317
05:16:48,460 --> 05:16:51,460
Mr. Himulens discovered a completely new plant

5318
05:16:51,460 --> 05:16:53,460
and is going to be called Himulensis.

5319
05:16:53,460 --> 05:16:56,460
Oh, that's wonderful.

5320
05:16:56,460 --> 05:16:58,460
Congratulations, Mr. Himulens.

5321
05:16:58,460 --> 05:17:00,460
Oh, well, it isn't official yet.

5322
05:17:00,460 --> 05:17:03,460
No, they're just thinking about the name still.

5323
05:17:03,460 --> 05:17:04,460
Give them time.

5324
05:17:04,460 --> 05:17:06,460
We should have a party for Mr. Himulens.

5325
05:17:06,460 --> 05:17:07,460
Shouldn't we, Papa?

5326
05:17:07,460 --> 05:17:08,460
What?

5327
05:17:08,460 --> 05:17:10,460
Oh, yes, indeed.

5328
05:17:10,460 --> 05:17:12,460
When, Papa, tonight?

5329
05:17:13,460 --> 05:17:15,460
Hmm, let me think.

5330
05:17:15,460 --> 05:17:18,460
We should wait just a little bit longer perhaps.

5331
05:17:18,460 --> 05:17:20,460
Oh, why do you say that?

5332
05:17:20,460 --> 05:17:21,460
Mr. Himulens.

5333
05:17:21,460 --> 05:17:23,460
You know that rare plant you found?

5334
05:17:23,460 --> 05:17:25,460
Does it have any flowers?

5335
05:17:25,460 --> 05:17:26,460
But, of course.

5336
05:17:26,460 --> 05:17:27,460
Are they pretty?

5337
05:17:27,460 --> 05:17:29,460
Very pretty.

5338
05:17:29,460 --> 05:17:32,460
Yes, just like you, Snork Maiden.

5339
05:17:32,460 --> 05:17:34,460
Oh, Mr. Himulens.

5340
05:17:34,460 --> 05:17:39,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

5341
05:17:40,460 --> 05:17:42,460
Hey, look, Snork Maiden.

5342
05:17:42,460 --> 05:17:45,460
Why don't we go and find out about those explosions tonight, huh?

5343
05:17:45,460 --> 05:17:46,460
All right.

5344
05:17:46,460 --> 05:17:48,460
You'll need me to find the way.

5345
05:17:48,460 --> 05:17:50,460
You want to come along?

5346
05:17:50,460 --> 05:17:51,460
You bet.

5347
05:17:51,460 --> 05:17:52,460
They come late at night.

5348
05:17:52,460 --> 05:17:54,460
I won't go to sleep, Ben.

5349
05:17:54,460 --> 05:17:56,460
What do you think, Snork Maiden?

5350
05:17:56,460 --> 05:17:57,460
I'm not sure.

5351
05:17:57,460 --> 05:18:00,460
Isn't there anything you can do to change your mind, movement?

5352
05:18:00,460 --> 05:18:01,460
I don't know.

5353
05:18:01,460 --> 05:18:02,460
Listen, little Maiden.

5354
05:18:02,460 --> 05:18:03,460
You have to be careful.

5355
05:18:03,460 --> 05:18:04,460
This could be dangerous.

5356
05:18:04,460 --> 05:18:06,460
Obviously, or I wouldn't come.

5357
05:18:06,460 --> 05:18:08,460
Would I spoil my sleep?

5358
05:18:08,460 --> 05:18:10,460
Well, stick close to us, then.

5359
05:18:10,460 --> 05:18:11,460
Yes, do that.

5360
05:18:11,460 --> 05:18:13,460
I also went down to the beach late last night

5361
05:18:13,460 --> 05:18:15,460
to try and find out what was happening.

5362
05:18:15,460 --> 05:18:17,460
And while I was there, I saw the witch flying around

5363
05:18:17,460 --> 05:18:19,460
on her broomstick.

5364
05:18:19,460 --> 05:18:20,460
Oh, really?

5365
05:18:20,460 --> 05:18:22,460
Why didn't you tell me so I could have come along?

5366
05:18:22,460 --> 05:18:23,460
I could hide better than you.

5367
05:18:23,460 --> 05:18:25,460
You're so white.

5368
05:18:25,460 --> 05:18:26,460
See, movement?

5369
05:18:26,460 --> 05:18:29,460
I'm not big in white like you.

5370
05:18:29,460 --> 05:18:31,460
Oh, there's someone coming.

5371
05:18:31,460 --> 05:18:33,460
Who?

5372
05:18:35,460 --> 05:18:37,460
It's Alicia.

5373
05:18:37,460 --> 05:18:39,460
Hey, Alicia.

5374
05:18:39,460 --> 05:18:41,460
Hi, Alicia.

5375
05:18:41,460 --> 05:18:43,460
Oh, my man.

5376
05:18:43,460 --> 05:18:44,460
Hello, Alicia.

5377
05:18:44,460 --> 05:18:45,460
How are you?

5378
05:18:45,460 --> 05:18:47,460
Have you three come here to play with me?

5379
05:18:47,460 --> 05:18:50,460
No, I'm afraid we have, but it's good to see you.

5380
05:18:50,460 --> 05:18:51,460
Yes, Alicia.

5381
05:18:51,460 --> 05:18:52,460
Yes?

5382
05:18:52,460 --> 05:18:55,460
Has your grandmother been kind to you since your last visit to us?

5383
05:18:55,460 --> 05:18:56,460
Very kind.

5384
05:18:56,460 --> 05:18:58,460
She's been treating me very well.

5385
05:18:58,460 --> 05:19:00,460
Ever since I stopped coming to see you.

5386
05:19:00,460 --> 05:19:01,460
Oh, good.

5387
05:19:01,460 --> 05:19:03,460
But we do miss you, Alicia.

5388
05:19:03,460 --> 05:19:04,460
Oh, I miss you, too.

5389
05:19:04,460 --> 05:19:06,460
But I must keep my promise to her.

5390
05:19:06,460 --> 05:19:08,460
She'd be upset if I broke it.

5391
05:19:08,460 --> 05:19:09,460
What are these weeds?

5392
05:19:09,460 --> 05:19:10,460
They're herbs.

5393
05:19:10,460 --> 05:19:12,460
Herbs are very important for a witch.

5394
05:19:12,460 --> 05:19:14,460
And frogs, bellies, and lizard's tails.

5395
05:19:14,460 --> 05:19:16,460
They're important, too, of course.

5396
05:19:16,460 --> 05:19:18,460
I think that's licorice.

5397
05:19:18,460 --> 05:19:19,460
That's right.

5398
05:19:19,460 --> 05:19:20,460
Very clever, Snuffkin.

5399
05:19:20,460 --> 05:19:22,460
We use that for heartburn and coughs.

5400
05:19:22,460 --> 05:19:24,460
The taste smells quite nice.

5401
05:19:24,460 --> 05:19:27,460
And it also stops cows from giving their milk.

5402
05:19:27,460 --> 05:19:28,460
I see.

5403
05:19:28,460 --> 05:19:29,460
That's interesting.

5404
05:19:37,460 --> 05:19:38,460
Oh, it's right.

5405
05:19:51,460 --> 05:19:53,460
Hello, Mr. Hillman.

5406
05:19:53,460 --> 05:19:55,460
Splendid days.

5407
05:19:55,460 --> 05:19:57,460
Hello, Mr. Hillman.

5408
05:19:57,460 --> 05:19:59,460
Don't you work so hard.

5409
05:19:59,460 --> 05:20:02,460
Yeah, I guess I do with that.

5410
05:20:03,460 --> 05:20:05,460
Wait.

5411
05:20:05,460 --> 05:20:06,460
Stop.

5412
05:20:06,460 --> 05:20:08,460
What is it, Mr. Hillman?

5413
05:20:08,460 --> 05:20:09,460
My letter.

5414
05:20:09,460 --> 05:20:11,460
I just want my letter.

5415
05:20:11,460 --> 05:20:12,460
There isn't one.

5416
05:20:12,460 --> 05:20:13,460
But why not?

5417
05:20:13,460 --> 05:20:16,460
You didn't have any yesterday or the day before.

5418
05:20:16,460 --> 05:20:18,460
Yeah, I know that.

5419
05:20:18,460 --> 05:20:19,460
Nobody's written to you.

5420
05:20:19,460 --> 05:20:20,460
That's why.

5421
05:20:20,460 --> 05:20:22,460
Well, somebody should have written.

5422
05:20:22,460 --> 05:20:25,460
Are you quite, quite sure that you've gone through your bag properly?

5423
05:20:25,460 --> 05:20:29,460
Don't you know I'm expecting an important letter from an important scientist?

5424
05:20:29,460 --> 05:20:31,460
It must be in your bag.

5425
05:20:31,460 --> 05:20:33,460
Ah, all right, then.

5426
05:20:33,460 --> 05:20:34,460
Go ahead.

5427
05:20:34,460 --> 05:20:35,460
What?

5428
05:20:35,460 --> 05:20:38,460
Well, you don't seem to trust me to do my job properly, Mr. Hemulin.

5429
05:20:38,460 --> 05:20:39,460
Go ahead.

5430
05:20:39,460 --> 05:20:41,460
Have a look for yourself, then.

5431
05:20:41,460 --> 05:20:43,460
Oh, but of course I trust you.

5432
05:20:43,460 --> 05:20:44,460
Sorry.

5433
05:20:44,460 --> 05:20:45,460
No, no.

5434
05:20:45,460 --> 05:20:46,460
You better have a look.

5435
05:20:46,460 --> 05:20:47,460
What do you think I do?

5436
05:20:47,460 --> 05:20:49,460
Steam them open and read them at night?

5437
05:20:49,460 --> 05:20:50,460
No.

5438
05:20:50,460 --> 05:20:54,460
Oh, you seem to have a lot of letters today.

5439
05:20:54,460 --> 05:20:58,460
Oh, I really think I should ask for a higher salary.

5440
05:20:58,460 --> 05:21:00,460
I deserve it.

5441
05:21:01,460 --> 05:21:02,460
Ah!

5442
05:21:02,460 --> 05:21:04,460
I'm just starving.

5443
05:21:04,460 --> 05:21:07,460
I might have to go over and visit the moments in a minute.

5444
05:21:13,460 --> 05:21:15,460
Oh.

5445
05:21:15,460 --> 05:21:17,460
I'm sleepy, too.

5446
05:21:17,460 --> 05:21:19,460
I could go on sleeping.

5447
05:21:19,460 --> 05:21:20,460
Oh!

5448
05:21:20,460 --> 05:21:21,460
Oh!

5449
05:21:21,460 --> 05:21:23,460
What do you think you're doing?

5450
05:21:23,460 --> 05:21:25,460
Oh, I'm sorry.

5451
05:21:25,460 --> 05:21:27,460
I didn't see you there.

5452
05:21:27,460 --> 05:21:28,460
Hmm?

5453
05:21:28,460 --> 05:21:30,460
There's nothing else out here and you didn't see me?

5454
05:21:30,460 --> 05:21:31,460
I'm sorry.

5455
05:21:31,460 --> 05:21:32,460
Oh, dear.

5456
05:21:32,460 --> 05:21:34,460
What does this matter with you?

5457
05:21:34,460 --> 05:21:37,460
Is this place called Moomin Valley?

5458
05:21:37,460 --> 05:21:38,460
Yes.

5459
05:21:38,460 --> 05:21:39,460
That's right.

5460
05:21:39,460 --> 05:21:41,460
At last, I found it.

5461
05:21:41,460 --> 05:21:43,460
I never thought I'd really make it.

5462
05:21:43,460 --> 05:21:44,460
Excuse me.

5463
05:21:44,460 --> 05:21:46,460
Are you all right?

5464
05:21:46,460 --> 05:21:48,460
Doctor me, miss.

5465
05:21:48,460 --> 05:21:50,460
Oh, tell me what's bothering you.

5466
05:21:50,460 --> 05:21:51,460
Huh?

5467
05:21:51,460 --> 05:21:52,460
Oh, she's ill.

5468
05:21:52,460 --> 05:21:54,460
She's got a fever.

5469
05:21:54,460 --> 05:21:56,460
Please leave me alone.

5470
05:21:56,460 --> 05:21:58,460
But you can lie here.

5471
05:21:58,460 --> 05:22:00,460
You should be in bed, young lady.

5472
05:22:00,460 --> 05:22:02,460
Do you know a man called Hamilton?

5473
05:22:02,460 --> 05:22:03,460
Yes.

5474
05:22:03,460 --> 05:22:06,460
Have you walked all the way to Moomin Valley to visit him?

5475
05:22:06,460 --> 05:22:08,460
So I have come to the right place.

5476
05:22:08,460 --> 05:22:10,460
He does live here.

5477
05:22:10,460 --> 05:22:11,460
Oh, yes.

5478
05:22:11,460 --> 05:22:12,460
He lives very close to here.

5479
05:22:12,460 --> 05:22:16,460
I'm so glad I must see him immediately here.

5480
05:22:16,460 --> 05:22:18,460
Oh, what shall I do?

5481
05:22:18,460 --> 05:22:19,460
I must do something.

5482
05:22:19,460 --> 05:22:20,460
Come here, someone.

5483
05:22:20,460 --> 05:22:22,460
Someone help me.

5484
05:22:22,460 --> 05:22:24,460
Oh, my goodness.

5485
05:22:24,460 --> 05:22:27,460
Help!

5486
05:22:27,460 --> 05:22:30,460
Anyone help!

5487
05:22:30,460 --> 05:22:33,460
Help me somebody!

5488
05:22:43,460 --> 05:22:44,460
Papa!

5489
05:22:44,460 --> 05:22:45,460
Papa!

5490
05:22:45,460 --> 05:22:47,460
He's up in the guest room if you want him.

5491
05:22:47,460 --> 05:22:49,460
Mama's there as well.

5492
05:22:49,460 --> 05:22:50,460
What for?

5493
05:22:50,460 --> 05:22:52,460
I just rescued a girl, you know.

5494
05:22:52,460 --> 05:22:53,460
A girl?

5495
05:22:53,460 --> 05:22:54,460
Did you, Sniff?

5496
05:22:54,460 --> 05:22:55,460
That's right.

5497
05:22:55,460 --> 05:22:56,460
Very pretty, too.

5498
05:22:56,460 --> 05:22:59,460
She's ill and I put her to bed myself.

5499
05:22:59,460 --> 05:23:00,460
I'm going to see her.

5500
05:23:00,460 --> 05:23:01,460
Me, too.

5501
05:23:03,460 --> 05:23:05,460
I want another look as well.

5502
05:23:07,460 --> 05:23:09,460
First, we must bring her fever down.

5503
05:23:09,460 --> 05:23:11,460
I think you're right.

5504
05:23:11,460 --> 05:23:13,460
Yes?

5505
05:23:16,460 --> 05:23:18,460
Sniff just told us about her.

5506
05:23:18,460 --> 05:23:19,460
Oh, dear.

5507
05:23:19,460 --> 05:23:20,460
Is she unconscious?

5508
05:23:20,460 --> 05:23:21,460
Yes.

5509
05:23:21,460 --> 05:23:22,460
Where'd she come from?

5510
05:23:22,460 --> 05:23:24,460
We don't know, little Maya.

5511
05:23:24,460 --> 05:23:26,460
But Sniff said she'd come here to visit the hemeland.

5512
05:23:26,460 --> 05:23:27,460
That's right.

5513
05:23:27,460 --> 05:23:29,460
And Snort Maiden's gone to get him.

5514
05:23:29,460 --> 05:23:31,460
She's pretty, isn't she?

5515
05:23:31,460 --> 05:23:32,460
You're right.

5516
05:23:32,460 --> 05:23:33,460
Very.

5517
05:23:33,460 --> 05:23:36,460
By the way, Moomin, what did the witch say?

5518
05:23:36,460 --> 05:23:37,460
Oh, dear.

5519
05:23:37,460 --> 05:23:39,460
Must I really run like this?

5520
05:23:39,460 --> 05:23:40,460
Oh!

5521
05:23:40,460 --> 05:23:42,460
Where is the visitor, young girl?

5522
05:23:42,460 --> 05:23:45,460
Well, if she's sick, why don't you give her some medicine?

5523
05:23:45,460 --> 05:23:47,460
I don't know any young girls apart from her.

5524
05:23:47,460 --> 05:23:48,460
Don't!

5525
05:23:48,460 --> 05:23:49,460
Just keep running!

5526
05:23:53,460 --> 05:23:56,460
I told you, I do not know this person.

5527
05:23:56,460 --> 05:23:57,460
Maybe she's changed.

5528
05:23:57,460 --> 05:23:59,460
I've already told you.

5529
05:23:59,460 --> 05:24:01,460
I have never known any young girls.

5530
05:24:01,460 --> 05:24:04,460
Then why do you think she'd want to come to visit you, hemeland?

5531
05:24:04,460 --> 05:24:06,460
She's a botanist.

5532
05:24:06,460 --> 05:24:09,460
And obviously, she's heard of me and wants to come and see

5533
05:24:09,460 --> 05:24:11,460
the famous hemeland for herself.

5534
05:24:11,460 --> 05:24:12,460
Oh, dear.

5535
05:24:12,460 --> 05:24:14,460
She can tell us when she wakes up.

5536
05:24:14,460 --> 05:24:17,460
We must leave her now so that grandma's medicine can work.

5537
05:24:18,460 --> 05:24:20,460
I think I'll be getting home.

5538
05:24:20,460 --> 05:24:22,460
Oh, we couldn't let you go just like that.

5539
05:24:22,460 --> 05:24:24,460
Please, stay and have some tea with us.

5540
05:24:24,460 --> 05:24:26,460
Thank you, but no, I have some plans to press.

5541
05:24:26,460 --> 05:24:29,460
And you're sure you're quite sure you don't know this girl?

5542
05:24:29,460 --> 05:24:31,460
Absolutely certain.

5543
05:24:31,460 --> 05:24:33,460
I really must go.

5544
05:24:36,460 --> 05:24:38,460
I'd forgotten all about you.

5545
05:24:38,460 --> 05:24:41,460
I'm sure you're sure you're sure you don't know this girl.

5546
05:24:41,460 --> 05:24:42,460
Absolutely certain.

5547
05:24:42,460 --> 05:24:44,460
I really must go.

5548
05:24:45,460 --> 05:24:47,460
I'd forgotten all about the bangs.

5549
05:24:47,460 --> 05:24:49,460
Well, we haven't snuffed Ken and I.

5550
05:24:49,460 --> 05:24:51,460
I'm going to look for them tonight.

5551
05:24:51,460 --> 05:24:53,460
I'd like to come too, but I can't.

5552
05:24:53,460 --> 05:24:55,460
I'm going with them.

5553
05:24:55,460 --> 05:24:57,460
Are you snort maiden?

5554
05:24:57,460 --> 05:24:59,460
You'll be hiding on the beach in the middle of the night?

5555
05:24:59,460 --> 05:25:00,460
Yes.

5556
05:25:00,460 --> 05:25:03,460
And then we'll rush off to where the bangs are coming from as soon as we hear them.

5557
05:25:03,460 --> 05:25:05,460
That's the plan.

5558
05:25:05,460 --> 05:25:07,460
Oh, I'd really love to come.

5559
05:25:07,460 --> 05:25:08,460
I'd rather go to bed.

5560
05:25:08,460 --> 05:25:11,460
I'd be a bit scared of the beach in the middle of the night.

5561
05:25:11,460 --> 05:25:14,460
After all, it's my duty to stay here with Movement Mama.

5562
05:25:14,460 --> 05:25:16,460
Are you coming, Sniff?

5563
05:25:16,460 --> 05:25:18,460
Certainly not.

5564
05:25:18,460 --> 05:25:20,460
Not me.

5565
05:25:22,460 --> 05:25:25,460
It just occurred to me that's why she's here.

5566
05:25:25,460 --> 05:25:27,460
Ah.

5567
05:25:37,460 --> 05:25:39,460
Here, you better take this movement.

5568
05:25:39,460 --> 05:25:41,460
You might get very hungry.

5569
05:25:41,460 --> 05:25:43,460
Oh, thank you, Mama.

5570
05:25:43,460 --> 05:25:45,460
A midnight snack. I really envy you.

5571
05:25:45,460 --> 05:25:48,460
Well, Grandpa, why don't you come with us?

5572
05:25:48,460 --> 05:25:50,460
Oh, there's nothing I'd love more.

5573
05:25:50,460 --> 05:25:53,460
But I'd better not tonight. Right, Mama?

5574
05:25:53,460 --> 05:25:55,460
Oh, definitely not.

5575
05:25:55,460 --> 05:25:59,460
What would I do if something happened to the girl while you were away?

5576
05:25:59,460 --> 05:26:00,460
Exactly.

5577
05:26:00,460 --> 05:26:03,460
All right, Papa. We'll find out about the bangs for you.

5578
05:26:03,460 --> 05:26:05,460
Thank you, Momenta.

5579
05:26:12,460 --> 05:26:15,460
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Good.

5580
05:26:15,460 --> 05:26:17,460
I think we should save this food for a while.

5581
05:26:17,460 --> 05:26:20,460
We might have to wait a long time for the explosions.

5582
05:26:20,460 --> 05:26:22,460
And they might not come tonight.

5583
05:26:22,460 --> 05:26:24,460
Stop stuffing yourself, Movement.

5584
05:26:24,460 --> 05:26:26,460
The rest is for a snuffkin and me.

5585
05:26:26,460 --> 05:26:28,460
But you can't eat anymore?

5586
05:26:28,460 --> 05:26:30,460
Yes, I can. We must share it in equal parts.

5587
05:26:30,460 --> 05:26:32,460
Otherwise, it's not fair.

5588
05:26:32,460 --> 05:26:35,460
I think it should be shared in proportion to how big one is.

5589
05:26:53,460 --> 05:26:55,460
Oh.

5590
05:27:01,460 --> 05:27:03,460
Hmm?

5591
05:27:03,460 --> 05:27:05,460
Ah, what are you back, John Brown?

5592
05:27:05,460 --> 05:27:06,460
From the sea.

5593
05:27:06,460 --> 05:27:07,460
Keep a sharp look down.

5594
05:27:07,460 --> 05:27:09,460
Look over there.

5595
05:27:11,460 --> 05:27:13,460
What is it?

5596
05:27:13,460 --> 05:27:16,460
Ah, ah. Wow.

5597
05:27:16,460 --> 05:27:18,460
Ah.

5598
05:27:19,460 --> 05:27:23,460
That's what I call fireworks.

5599
05:27:26,460 --> 05:27:27,460
Come on.

5600
05:27:27,460 --> 05:27:29,460
Somebody must be out there in a boat.

5601
05:27:39,460 --> 05:27:41,460
There's a boat.

5602
05:27:41,460 --> 05:27:43,460
The fireworks must have come from there.

5603
05:27:43,460 --> 05:27:46,460
Hey, come ashore.

5604
05:27:48,460 --> 05:27:50,460
Is that the hand you like?

5605
05:27:50,460 --> 05:27:51,460
No, I don't think so.

5606
05:27:51,460 --> 05:27:54,460
It looks like him, but he was much younger.

5607
05:27:54,460 --> 05:27:57,460
And so as a result of their excursion to the beach,

5608
05:27:57,460 --> 05:27:59,460
they finally learned that the big bangs

5609
05:27:59,460 --> 05:28:03,460
that had been waking everyone up were fireworks.

5610
05:28:03,460 --> 05:28:05,460
They also learned that the fireworks were coming

5611
05:28:05,460 --> 05:28:08,460
from a boat far out to sea.

5612
05:28:08,460 --> 05:28:14,460
But the man who had sent them up disappeared into the night.

5613
05:28:14,460 --> 05:28:21,460
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

5614
05:28:21,460 --> 05:28:28,460
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

5615
05:28:28,460 --> 05:28:32,460
They're always happy and goes at play.

5616
05:28:32,460 --> 05:28:36,460
The movements are having fun day after day.

5617
05:28:36,460 --> 05:28:39,460
The movements.

5618
05:28:39,460 --> 05:28:43,460
The movements.

5619
05:28:43,460 --> 05:28:49,460
The movements.
