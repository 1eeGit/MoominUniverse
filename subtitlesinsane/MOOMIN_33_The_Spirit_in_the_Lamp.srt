1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're here for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,640
I'm going to say that I'm not going to say that. I'm going to say that I'm not going to say that. with me, they're for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:37,280
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:50,000
like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there was the movement, There was the movement, there was the movement,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There was the movement, there was the movement,

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There was the movement, Snowton made him was in a very good mood because that day she was off to collect shells

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
of the seizure with Moon.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Moon!

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hey look, the sun's up and there's Gracie.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, Drak.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What's the matter, Papa?

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, it's you, moment.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What are you doing?

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I heard you talking to yourself just now.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Huh?

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You see this? I'm writing a play. I heard you talking to yourself just now. Huh? Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You see this? I'm writing a play.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Writing a play?

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You remember the last children?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That was a very successful play.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Just now I was repeating a line.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hey, look! Another beautiful day!

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And there goes Gracie.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a wonderful line, of course.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't you agree?

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It could be improved.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think about it.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Tee-hee-hee!

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, man, look at this!

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,240
Beautiful! Oh, man, look at this! Beautiful. Hey!

38
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,719
You find anything?

39
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,919
No, just usual old stuff.

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,879
Oh, there's another big one.

41
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,120
Can't you really find anything, moment?

42
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,199
I'll look somewhere else.

43
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,800
I still think this is the best place.

44
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Well, I'm going over there.

45
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,199
And you're so beautiful.

46
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,599
Oh.

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,599
What are you doing, movement?

48
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,199
I...

49
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,000
Now that's no shell surely. No.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So why did you dig it out?

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, once you see it, you won't find out what it is.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
A very odd thing, isn't it?

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Not very interesting.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh no, I can see what it is.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,599
I gave it a good wash.

56
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,759
I've seen one just like in the fairy tales.

57
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,080
It's an old lamb.

58
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,280
Yes, you remember the story called a maddit?

59
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,039
He rubbed the lamb and the genie appeared.

60
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:38,000
The genie might appear for us if we do what Aladdin did.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,479
Don't be silly, Snork Maiden.

62
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,759
Hmm.

63
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,000
Hmm.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But Snork Maiden, that was a fairy tale. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm And I'm sure you have to say some magic words, such as, apricot dapura, spirit come forth, apricot dapura,

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
try for all your worth.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You've chosen the wrong words.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You should say, come out, say some of your something.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Huh?

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness!

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Keep going, Stormy-dark!

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Ah! I am the spirit of the land. What is your command?

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Goodness, did you come out of this lamp?

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You got it.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So you really are the spirit of this lamp?

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Always have been.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But I have the book and you're not him.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can prove it if you're quite sure you want me to.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
By all means, it probably wasn't a good picture.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm the one and only spirit of the lamp.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Then you must have the power to make any wish come true, is that so?

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Her wish, certainly, but not yours.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But I'm the one who'll dug you out.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's not so important, kid.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
She's the one who summoned me forth from the lamp.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What are we gonna do about this spirit?

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why? Ask for something. Ask for something you've always wanted.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Uh, let's see. A pearl necklace.

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Soight, now your wish is my command. You always wanted. Uh, let's see. A pearl necklace.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Soight me, your wishes, my command.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Hey, wait a minute.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh. A pearl necklace is only one of the things I wanted I hadn't decided yet.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't worry, Snorkmaidum. I guess you can always send it back.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If I like the necklace, then it's your turn to rub the lamp.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Then you can wish for whatever you've always wanted. Yes, but where exactly did you rub the lamp?

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,480
Right here and very, very slowly.

96
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,759
All right, I'll say spirit come forth.

97
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:57,160
It sounds a little better than come out spirit.

98
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh!

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh!

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,800
Oh, nice.

101
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,000
What was that? Oh, it's back.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
One oil necklace, Miss. Thanks.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is incredible.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Right, I do think this is exactly what I wanted.

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, thank you ever so much.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
All in a day's wake.

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So pleased to oblige, Miss.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Are you going to be able to do this? Oh, thank you ever so much. All in a day's wake. So pleased to oblige, Miss.

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Are you going back into the lab?

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes, I am.

111
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm so happy. Now it's my turn to let you out of here.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'd like to have a wish granted too, please.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Now, wait a minute.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If getting in and out is a bother, why don't you let me give you my wish right now?

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Can't do it, young man. One at a time in the face to call. If getting in and out is a bother, why don't you let me give you my wish right now?

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Can't do it, young man, one at a time in the face to call.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Just one at a safe time.

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Impossible, young-said.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But why?

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Because I am only able to fulfill one wish a week.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I need my rest. It's hard working though.

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh well, of course it's tiring.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Perhaps I expected too much from you. Hold on, I wouldn't like you to think that I haven't got the power.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,399
I can do many extraordinary things.

125
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,399
What kind of things?

126
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,399
Not telling you.

127
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,800
Listen, moment, we won't tell a soul about this lamp, all right?

128
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,199
Of course not. Pee-hee-hee-hee-hee.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No! Names don't really matter. Tulip Hydrangea, who cares? No, that's not right yeah. Oh, yeah.

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh, yeah.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh, yeah.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, yeah.

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh, yeah.

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh, yeah.

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, yeah.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, yeah.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, yeah.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, yeah.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Hmm. Praise the lad and I didn't tell them I can get out at night.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'd have no peace at all.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
My leisure time would be totally ruined by these two.

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Good thing also I can read their minds so I know what I'm up against.

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:58,799
They're up to something I know they are. Oh yes, dear me, dear me. No wonder the young man is worried to death. She wish I better

144
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:05,000
rewrite this. Oh Edgur Edgur, I do wish you were somebody else.

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This will certainly have to be changed.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The whole page, really.

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What's going on here? Who did this?

148
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Mum, not you surely. What?

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And some rascals been rewriting my play.

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Who could that possibly be?

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Who indeed in the middle of the night while I was asleep.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's very strange, isn't it, Papa?

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It can't be you, Mum, can it?

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,720
Of course not, Papa.

155
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,919
I am upset.

156
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,279
Who can it be?

157
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:51,320
Imagine going into your study while you were fast asleep.

158
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,039
It's very rude, isn't it?

159
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,799
I find it incredible that anyone could do such a thing.

160
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,840
And all the rewriting was done on those bits

161
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,120
that I knew weren't perfectly polished.

162
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,679
Listen, dear, I'm sure they were far too good for him

163
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:10,000
to improve on. No, no, you're wrong. That's the worst thing. I must admit he did improve them.

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Then I think you should feel pleased, dear.

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes. No, I'm not a bit pleased. A dramatist should write his own plays.

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Looks great, Snork Maiden. That is, if you like necklaces.

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Thank you, little Maya, it was given to me as a present.

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Rather nice. Would you mind if I tried it on for a minute?

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Of course not. I'm sure you'll look gorgeous.

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I suppose in time one could get to like necklaces.

171
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I could ask for a similar one for you.

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Deepers, who's your rich friend?

173
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes. I searched the whole house, but I can't find it anywhere.

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Someone must have stolen it.

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't worry, Mrs. Philly-Junk. I fully expect to arrest the thief any minute now.

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Good afternoon, Inspector.

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Hello, Snort Maiden.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Please, hurry, Inspector.

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The thief has almost certainly left Moomin Valley already.

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,799
Oh, dear, oh, dear. nothing is safe in this valley anymore.

181
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,879
Now calm down, Mrs. Philly jog.

182
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,200
Did you just say you've had something stolen, Mrs. Philly jog?

183
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,639
My pearl necklace, extraordinarily beautiful pearls,

184
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,039
87 of them.

185
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:19,200
Looks just like the one you're wearing, little my.

186
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,039
You stole it.

187
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,399
Did you?

188
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,399
Hmm?

189
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh, oh knew you!

190
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What are you doing?

191
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Stop!

192
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Get off the doctor!

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Arrest your old brother!

194
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
She's a baby!

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
She's innocent!

196
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Little Maya, please!

197
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The smallest creature up in the most cunning and generous world!

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This is Snarkman's necklace, you know.

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Huh?

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's very funny, little Maya!

201
00:11:44,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Is that the best explanation you can think of? No one calls Little Maya thief and gets away with it! It means necklace you know. That's a lie! They stole it Inspector! I've never known them to lie before Mrs. Philly John.

202
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
From a very bad background! You should see their home!

203
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So right! I'm gonna see a photo of you!

204
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Stop it, little man!

205
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Bad background and you don't tell me that you say that!

206
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Remember, there's something I want to ask you, little man!

207
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What are you doing?

208
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The more I have to do a page, you know.

209
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
This is it.

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I love to know who did this. He's sitting there going to act with words.

211
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Listen to this. This is a good example.

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Hey, look at the sky, the sun's up and there's Gracie.

213
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's not great, sounds very ordinary.

214
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's what I wrote, Snuffkin.

215
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's all right.

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Now listen to how he rewrote it.

218
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,240
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks,

219
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,600
it is the east and Juliet is the sun, a rise,

220
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,480
fair sun, and kill the envious moon

221
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,720
who is already sick and pale with grief.

222
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,919
Bleh!

223
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,519
What a sunrise!

224
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,679
And note how clever this writer is to change

225
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,919
her name from Gracie to Juliet.

226
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,399
Oh, Gracie's worried because a parents

227
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,500
don't approve of her love Edgar.

228
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,539
I had his names don't matter,

229
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:30,940
to you lipid ranges who cares.

230
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,340
But listen to this.

231
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,620
What's in a name?

232
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,980
That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

233
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,080
Much more romantic.

234
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,019
I got a show on your wood.

235
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:43,779
What a notheromial cold.

236
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,200
Oh, it's simply great. Except maybe I wouldn't have on your wood. Well, he knocked a Romeo called. Oh, it's simply great.

237
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,700
Except maybe I wouldn't have mentioned his smell.

238
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,500
Don't you agree, he's an excellent playwright.

239
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Yes, I agree.

240
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,899
He sounds like a very promising playwright.

241
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,299
And then wordy, perhaps, but really good.

242
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:59,200
Very good indeed.

243
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,000
Write him a note asking him to carry on.

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
And there might not be necessary.

245
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,899
You know, all the changes were made in the middle of the night

246
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:07,700
while I was fast asleep,

247
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,500
and usually writers are in their beds

248
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,000
none of their desks when they're asleep.

249
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,700
Well, yes, that's the only time you're not at your desk, isn't it?

250
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,700
But there are people you know who walk about at night

251
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,299
without remembering about it the next morning.

252
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:24,000
Sleepwalkers, you mean?

253
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,919
Now I come to think of it, you were rather sleepy

254
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,240
when you woke up this morning.

255
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,879
You're right, Mum and Mama,

256
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:33,000
even sleepier than usual, just so.

257
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,240
You mean you yourself got up at night

258
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,240
and then went and rewrote the play and you sleep?

259
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,200
Well, yes, I have been worried about some minor things

260
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,399
in my play, so my subconsciousness, fairly rich and literary talent,

261
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,600
as we all know, comes to the rescue.

262
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,720
A moment, Papa.

263
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,320
And in my sleep, my imagination runs riot.

264
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,240
I have all sorts of good ideas that make me grab a pen

265
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,759
in the middle of the night and rush to my room

266
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,200
to let the real skill throw.

267
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,000
Got it. I got it! I got it!

268
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
With this I can have anything! I can do anything!

269
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Get me!

270
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Stop!

271
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
When I say stop, you have to stop!

272
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He's back dirty!

273
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I can be a pun on him.

274
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
We've arrived when he won't get lost!

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Get lost yourself! I my dope time for you.

276
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The inspector's chasing me.

277
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What you?

278
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Stop the little boy on the inspector.

279
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You have to stop the day's old.

280
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
He's not teaching me them.

281
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Don't deny it.

282
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I know why you're running.

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You stole that thing, didn't you?

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I know it's true.

285
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's from a pure business.

286
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's not yours.

287
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,759
But it must be somebody so make it my business. It's not yours. But it must be somebody, so make it my business.

288
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,240
Get it to me.

289
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,919
Or a sacrifice.

290
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:52,080
Please stop me from sending it. Give it back to me.

291
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,279
Oh, no.

292
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,279
Hey, that folks like the lamp we found.

293
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,879
And chase him and specks it up, me.

294
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,240
Hello?

295
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,360
Well, man, Stinky's got our magic lamp right after him!

296
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,440
Yes, we can't let him get away with it or terrible things might happen.

297
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,600
Did you hear that, Snuffkin?

298
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,080
He said magic lamp or something.

299
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,600
After lamp!

300
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,799
The magic lamp is mine, just leave me alone!

301
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, you guys, Stinky, help me get the necklace! Oh! You're the spirit of the lamp, aren't you? Yes, my master. What is your wish?

302
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You his master?

303
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes, me! I'm the master. I let him out, so he'll do what I say.

304
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't believe a word of this fairy tale's untrue.

305
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Maybe it isn't true, but it works.

306
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I saw Snorkmaiden wishing for a pearl necklace and her wish was granted.

307
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Uh-huh. So you're a star? Maybe it isn't true, but it works. I saw Snork maiden wishing for a pearl necklace

308
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
and her wish was granted.

309
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Uh-huh, so you're responsible.

310
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah, and I brought it right away.

311
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Now let me see.

312
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What do I want more than anything in the world?

313
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Stinky, he can only make one wish a week come true.

314
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You'll have to wait your turn.

315
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No, that's very unfair.

316
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Let's get back to the necklace. Where did you steal it from, Mr?

317
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't steal.

318
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Well then tell me where you found it.

319
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Around here somewhere.

320
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Mrs. Philly John's house, baby.

321
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't know who lives there.

322
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh, then you did steal the necklace.

323
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Well, that's a lot easier, you know.

324
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
How about a magic key that can open anything,

325
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
bolts and safes and stuff, huh?

326
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Listen, there's something I'd like to ask you.

327
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
A sack of gold wouldn't be half as much fun as a key that opens anything.

328
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Tell me, is it possible that you rewrote Woman Popus Play?

329
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yes, I did. It was really awful.

330
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh, come on, now I just needed some polishing.

331
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And what's more, see this young man standing here?

332
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Well, he was really worried about your play, you know?

333
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I was just trying to help.

334
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Is this true?

335
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah, safer than burglary, of course.

336
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But then there's professional pride to think of.

337
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I can explain, Papa. I saw you weren't happy about your play,

338
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and I wanted it to be a big success.

339
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Of course, I didn't want the spirit to write it himself. But I saw you weren't happy about your play, and I wanted it to be a big success.

340
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Of course, I didn't want the spirit to write it himself.

341
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm gonna take the key!

342
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I've just realized everybody, the spirit didn't write all that himself.

343
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I've heard it before. I thought it sounded familiar.

344
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Really, is that so?

345
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yes, he stole it from a play by somebody else.

346
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,440
This spirit is a cheat and a liar.

347
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,680
Oh, damn you.

348
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,680
Well, I can't help being so well read.

349
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,079
Can I go back in the lamp now?

350
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:51,680
No!

351
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,079
Wait!

352
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,079
Don't forget, though!

353
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:55,079
I want next week's list now!

354
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,839
Sorry, Master Canabline.

355
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,400
Have them put into an impossible situation.

356
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,559
See you next week!

357
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,000
But that's ridiculous.

358
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Not next week, nor next month, or even next year.

359
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Stinky, this lamp is not yours.

360
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Besides, I know exactly the sort of thing you'd ask for,

361
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
a master key or something.

362
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Ha!

363
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Ha! You think you can hide that magic lamp from me, do you?

364
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Well, there's no hiding place good enough for that.

365
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Hmm. No, man, I really do think that lamp is a bit too dangerous to have. You're not going to get left for me, do you? Well, there's no hiding place good enough for that.

366
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Hmm.

367
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Well, then I really do think that lamp is a bit too dangerous to have a rod.

368
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Hmm. I think you're right.

369
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Snuffkin, do you have any good ideas for us? We can summon the spirit again.

370
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There's the inspector!

371
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You do it, Snuffkin.

372
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'll be back.

373
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'll be back. There's the inspector!

374
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You do it, Snuffkin! Cold the spirit!

375
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Oh, no, not again! What do you want this time?

376
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Can you bring the hobgoblin here?

377
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I suppose so. I'll be back as soon as I can.

378
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But why on earth do you want the hobgoblin?

379
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
As far as I can see, there's only one safe place for the lap where no one can find it.

380
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And that's on another planet, and the only one safe place for the lamp where no one can find it.

381
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And that's on another planet, and the only one who can put it there is the Hobgoblin.

382
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He's coming any minute!

383
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Geez, that guy ever hard to find!

384
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Thank you.

385
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I've done my wake for this week. See you next week.

386
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Goodbye! And some of the hard-gun took the magic ram away and hid it on some unknown planet.

387
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And a good thing too, it would really be very boring if all your wishes were granted, wouldn't it? We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

388
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
They're always happy and goes at play

389
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The Moons are having fun day after day, the Moons

390
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The Moons

391
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The Moons.
