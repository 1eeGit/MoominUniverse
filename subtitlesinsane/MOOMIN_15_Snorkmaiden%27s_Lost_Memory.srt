Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come. Come on and sit down here with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird,

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's a lovely day, and at last, movement is persuaded to come out for a walk in the lonely mountains.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,040
Oh, it's beautiful up here. Aren't you glad you came now? Ah...

6
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,439
This is much better than fairy tales, isn't it, Snork Maiden?

7
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,840
Oh, look, Moomin! It's Adelvice!

8
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,439
Hmm? Adelvice?

9
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:21,400
No, it isn't. That doesn't grow here at all.

10
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,520
I'm sure it is. I know what it looks like.

11
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry, but it's not. Oh, it's just like in Heidi.

12
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No, it's not. It's just a daisy.

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, come on. I want to pick it.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, no, it's too dangerous.

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I know then. You can do it.

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're my boyfriend, aren't you, Moomin?

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well, I suppose we could climb down there,

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
but I promise you it's not Adelvice.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That only grows in the Alps and they're hundreds of miles away. You're my boyfriend, aren't you, Moomin? Well, I suppose we could climb down there, but I promise you it's not Adelvice.

20
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,599
That only grows in the Alps and there are hundreds of miles away.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,599
I know it's Adelvice.

22
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,000
Be careful. They don't care about danger and fairy tales.

23
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:09,199
That's why they call them fairy tales, silly.

24
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,199
Fair Princess, please accept this, my humble offering. Thank you, Brave Knight. You were right, movement. This isn't Adelvice.

25
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,000
See, I told you. It's gonna be hard to get down from here, you know.

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,800
Can't we go back the way we came?

27
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,300
Well, I think it'll be easier to try down from here, you know? Can't we go back the way we came?

28
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,139
Well, I think it'll be easier to try to get to that path.

29
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:30,139
If you say so.

30
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,479
It's nearer anyway, and better than going up.

31
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,819
I'm surprised you're such a good climber.

32
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:45,599
Oh, Royalty is good at practically everything.

33
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,599
Huh?

34
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,120
Oh, start playing.

35
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,960
Oh!

36
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,800
Oh!

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,639
Oh!

38
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,479
Oh!

39
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,479
Oh!

40
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,479
Oh!

41
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,479
Oh!

42
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,479
Stop playing us!

43
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,479
Oh!

44
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,479
Oh!

45
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,479
Stop playing us!

46
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,479
Oh!

47
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,479
Oh!

48
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,479
Oh!

49
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,479
Oh!

50
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! No!

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Stop, Peter!

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let me see six petals. Huh.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What was that? A giant snow ball?

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It can't be, it isn't winter.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
Oh well, nothing of interest to me.

56
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Now where was I?

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Huh?

58
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,199
We start handling.

59
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,120
Has Snorkmaiden just gone past you?

60
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,560
Snorkmaiden, no, all I've seen going past

61
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,160
is a very large snowball.

62
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,240
That was Snorkmaiden.

63
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,000
But she's not made of snow?

64
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:44,959
Stop!

65
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,000
Snorkma it! Stop!

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Snork made it! Snork made it!

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, I'll praise the bo'm not. I'm not.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm not.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm not.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm not.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm not.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm not.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm not.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm not.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm not.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm not.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm not. I'm not. She's unconscious. What are you trying to do? I want to get her home to Mama.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, difficult. She should lose a bit of weight.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Perhaps she'd come around if we splashed cold water on her face.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There's nothing to fetch it in.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If you cut some bark off a tree trunk, you could make a small container.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,500
What a good idea. If you stay here, I'll go and do that.

83
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,800
Wake up, Snorkmaiden.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, that's cold. Has she come round yet, Mr. Hemuelin?

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh good.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,680
It's working.

89
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
How are your feelings, Snark Maiden?

90
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
Are you alright, Snark Maiden?

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,240
Oh, where am I?

92
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,800
We're still up in Lonely Mountains.

93
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,560
Who am I?

94
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,199
Why Royal Highness the Princess of Lonely Mountains?

95
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,199
What?

96
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,199
A Princess?

97
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh yes, of course. the princess of Lonely Mountains. What? A princess?

98
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,959
Oh yes, of course.

99
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,399
And who are you?

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,160
I am the prince of Lonely Mountains.

101
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh yeah?

102
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,399
Oh yeah? With that ridiculous shape?

103
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,040
Ha!

104
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,519
No, a jester perhaps.

105
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,639
You what?

106
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,360
You there?

107
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:14,000
Do not laugh!

108
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:17,600
I think the poor girl must have lost her memory.

109
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,199
Of course not, she's just pretending.

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
When does not whisper with royalty present, do you hear? So sorry, your royal highness.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
A poor crafters cabin.

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is your castle, ma'am.

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Royalty doesn't live in shacks.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Snork maiden.

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Stop calling us that.

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's very rude.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,220
Oh, forgive me.

118
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,500
Our royal castle is elsewhere. Is it not? What?

119
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:04,500
That must be a hunting lodge. No, of course that's what it is. Good. We accept that.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you two gonna tell me what you're so busy looking at?

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Send a mate to my room, my good man. A maid?

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
My good man.

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Papa, have you seen Snork Maiden?

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes, up there.

125
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Mama, please would you go on have a word with Snork Maiden?

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Have you been quarreling? Oh no. It's just that she fell and banged her head,

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and now she thinks she's a royal princess.

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What?

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh, oh, oh.

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ah, Nanette! Come here, please.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Nanette? I'm Boomin Mama.

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Oh, we're too weary for your foolish jokes, girl.

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh, we are very tired indeed today.

134
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm going to go to bed.

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm going to go to bed.

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,860
I'm going to Mama. Oh, we're too weary for your foolish jokes, girl.

137
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,139
Oh, we are very tired indeed, Nanette.

138
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:15,620
Please bring our silk nightie with the hand embroidered swans and clowns.

139
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,139
Then you may go.

140
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,539
I wish you, Mama.

141
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:25,000
All right, I'm sure.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But she seems convinced she's a princess.

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Sounds as if it's dangerous, doesn't it, Mama?

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, I don't think so.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I was only joking when I called her a princess.

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm very glad you didn't call her an opera singer.

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's not made in the sleep now?

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, yes.

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
In a night gown with crowns and swans embroidered on it.

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And another thing, boom, and she wants a canopy put up immediately.

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What's that?

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,500
Oh, a fancy cover over the bed.

153
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,000
It's draped in silks, and velvets, and tassels.

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh.

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,500
She was very upset because there wasn't one there already.

156
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,000
It might be necessary.

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Her memory could have come back by the time she wakes up.

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,500
Why don't we wait and see?

159
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
She might be fine after a rest.

160
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,080
I sure hope so. But what do we do if it hasn't come back? by the time she wakes up, why don't we wait and see? She might be fine after a rest.

161
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,320
I sure hope so.

162
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,320
But what do we do if it hasn't come back?

163
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Let's think about that if it happens.

164
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,919
We might not have to build that canopy.

165
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,039
Let me try it.

166
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:16,919
Try what?

167
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,200
To get Stark Maiden's memory back, what else?

168
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,440
Oh, how?

169
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,279
Well, I think that if she sees me, she'll remember me

170
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,000
and then she'll remember everything else, too.

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Don't be silly little mind.

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If she doesn't remember me, why should you remember you, eh?

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Simple, because I'm unforgettable.

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
There is that, I suppose.

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
She's still fast asleep.

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Well, I'm glad we made the canopy anyway.

177
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It looks really great, doesn't it?

178
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh, oh, look! She's opening her eyes.

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Are you awake?

180
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Get up, Snork maiden. Come on!

181
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Let's go down to the beach!

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And who is that person?

183
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,299
Come on, you remember me. I warn you of you, though you'll be sorry!

184
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,700
Oh, quite amusing!

185
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,539
Ah, so you remember me now!

186
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,240
Of course we do!

187
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,840
There you are, I told you!

188
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,299
Who am I then?

189
00:11:15,580 --> 00:12:05,200
Well, you're another court jester, of course! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, Moment asked me to come over to Moment House and propose to some princess!

190
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,659
Moments lost his marbles as well then! I think he wanted Stinky as a contrast.

191
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:10,500
You what?

192
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,100
You mean to tell me you're both my rivals for the hands of the royal princess?

193
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, it's not very original, but in order to win the princess.

194
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,600
And half her kingdom, Stinky, you'll need to solve three riddles.

195
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,960
Hey, that's great! What's this kingdom like?

196
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,440
All right, sooner number one, you may now enter.

197
00:12:30,440 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, that, Princess! How Are you ready?

198
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Fire away!

199
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Now then, listen. What is it that is yellow has four legs and sings?

200
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Oh, dear. An unusual canary?

201
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
With four legs, you nincomboop.

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't know any birds with four legs.

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,299
Who said it was a bird?

204
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:29,279
All right then, what's the answer, snark baby?

205
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,159
He shows no respect.

206
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,759
Throw him into a dungeon and give him no food.

207
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:34,559
You're heinous.

208
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,679
He is temporarily out of his mind after the long journey here.

209
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,879
Hang on, I'm not out of my mind.

210
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,279
God, up she is.

211
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,480
How for what's the answer?

212
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,360
That's what I want to know.

213
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,000
Silence, it does not concern you. Out of skin! How for what's the answer? That's what I want to know! Silence!

214
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It does not concern you!

215
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We believe you to be of lowly birth!

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Sorry about this, Nuffkin.

217
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Don't worry.

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Hmm, no, Sir Galaad, but not bad.

219
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I am honored to be here, your Royal Highness.

220
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He'll do.

221
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
An easy riddle to start.

222
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Here it is.

223
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
First, what is the number of which we think?

224
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Take your time.

225
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Two?

226
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Bravo, Gallant Knight. That is correct.

227
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Now listen, what is the word upon our mind?

228
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Love.

229
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,460
That's amazing!

230
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,539
Truly, the suitor has brains as well as looks!

231
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:31,179
Question three, there are two numbers on our mind.

232
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:32,620
What do they add up to?

233
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,659
Answer carefully for it.

234
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:36,259
Could unlock your princess's heart.

235
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:37,740
21.

236
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,139
Oh, was that right, too?

237
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:49,740
Oh no, it was 22.

238
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,039
My heart is heavy. For chance we should have said it was correct.

239
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,440
He was rather cute.

240
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,720
Was he not just her?

241
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,799
It's your turn now, stinky.

242
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,159
Well, I suppose that even half of Snort Toss would be something.

243
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,919
Ha, ha, ha.

244
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,139
Think she'll ever get her memory back?

245
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,139
Of course she will.

246
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:11,480
This is not our idea of a suitor.

247
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,080
His heart is aching for you, Royal Highness.

248
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,679
Ah, let it ache.

249
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,879
Oh, alright.

250
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,279
I'll give him a chance.

251
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,159
Here is a question number one.

252
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,279
What is the number we are thinking of?

253
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,000
Well of all our stupid questions!

254
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We haven't all day! He's stuck in that's up there. What? What's up with his hands? It's not fair, right? The man's back at his home.

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Go home.

256
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Give me another one I want after.

257
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,899
Oh, what a rude suitor.

258
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,320
We are no longer in the mood for royal marriage,

259
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,279
Jester, at least not today.

260
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,840
A wise decision.

261
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,360
Oh, princess of the lonely mountains?

262
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,240
They will be prostrate with grief,

263
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,360
but bid the other suitors to go home.

264
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,000
Do not let them beg. We would not like that.

265
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Very well, your royal highness.

266
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Do it kindly. We wish them no pain at all.

267
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
From this day on, we shall devote ourselves to good works and to the well-being of our people.

268
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh.

269
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You, I didn't want to marry you anyway.

270
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Wonder what snort maidens up to now?

271
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Upstairs thinking. She says she'll devote her life to good works.

272
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Works, what works?

273
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't know, but she probably wants to be remembered in the history books.

274
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The princess who was adored by her subjects.

275
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh, she's coming down.

276
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Your royal highness, may I assist you?

277
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Send the net to us.

278
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
She is on an errand, your highness.

279
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Then have someone else make soup, nourishing but not too rich.

280
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Soup, highness?

281
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes indeed, and then we shall take it to our poor subjects ourselves.

282
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,880
What kind of soup? We don't know.

283
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,480
We eat.

284
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,799
We don't cook.

285
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,519
The poor will be happy with anything

286
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,519
brought by the princess herself.

287
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,440
Now hurry, man.

288
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,240
Be quick about it.

289
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:18,920
No, she wants some soup.

290
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,000
This will be ample. The poor do not eat much. It would only make the meal.

291
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't know anyone poor around here, your majesty.

292
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Nonsense! Greetings, Jester.

293
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What now?

294
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
We're taking soup to the poor.

295
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Made with our own wriggle fingers.

296
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Do you know where they are, Jester?

297
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Your fingers?

298
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh, I know.

299
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Good!

300
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Wonderful!

301
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Take us to them now.

302
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
They will be so grateful.

303
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You bet, Princess!

304
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That house there!

305
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh yes! It's nice to know that the poor and my kingdom are so well off! Oh, you! Please come over here!

306
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Hmm? Who are you?

307
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm the Princess of Lonely Mountain.

308
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Princess?

309
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Oh! What moment you're all highness!

310
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Do not keep us waiting! We have a lot to do!

311
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm coming! I'm coming!

312
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh! I'm coming!

313
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm coming!

314
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! Oh! What moment you're all highness! Do not keep us waiting! We have a lot to do!

315
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm coming! I'm coming!

316
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Forgive me you're all highness! I had no idea you were...

317
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
My mind's smart maiden! That common name again we are princesses!

318
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,200
Handle sticks! You're not right in the head coming here bothering your elders and bettertors like this. My bettors? Oh, are you the queen then?

319
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,920
I am Mrs. Philly, John. Now what do you want?

320
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,759
You're just fulfilling our royal duty bringing soup to the poor, giving

321
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,279
cheer to those less fortunate that ourselves? Here my good woman, now if you just

322
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:26,000
pour, oh there you call me poor, you who who doesn't have a stitch of clothing to your name!

323
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, the rich aroma of the soup must have overcome you, Mrs. Philly John.

324
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Ah!

325
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Eat it yourself, Your Majesty!

326
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Ah!

327
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
This is how I treason!

328
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Send for the guard!

329
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Take her to the tower!

330
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Oh!

331
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh!

332
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We cannot see!

333
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm afraid that serves you Oh! We cannot see!

334
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm afraid that serves you right, Snork Maiden.

335
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Snork Maiden!

336
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Don't use that common name!

337
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Help us! We cannot see!

338
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Please don't steal your little highness.

339
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh hold a moment!

340
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, oh, oh!

341
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I think it's stuck moment.

342
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,559
Use the handle. Oh!

343
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,240
Stop!

344
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,079
You're hurting me, Bruce!

345
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:07,960
I'll get it on!

346
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,079
Out of the way!

347
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,480
Ah, wait a minute.

348
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,400
You can't break that soup, Torine.

349
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,039
It's a family heirloom.

350
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,400
And you mustn't hit snorkemaiden on the head.

351
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,119
You might hurt her.

352
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,720
Stop fooling around and get this thing off, will you?

353
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,640
All right.

354
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh, poor smart maiden. You didn't have to get up that hard.

355
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,799
Difficult to judge it with a broom.

356
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,240
I've never hit anyone wearing a subterrain before.

357
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,440
You will write your royal highness.

358
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,759
Oh, forgive us, your royal highness.

359
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,920
Sprinkle some cold water over her face.

360
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,000
No, she'd hate that, mama.

361
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,319
Snorkmaiden. Oh, it'd hate that, mama. Snork maiden. Oh, it's no good,

362
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,480
woman. I don't think she'll wake up to anything but your royal highness. Your

363
00:20:50,480 --> 00:21:01,279
highness, your highness! Snork maiden. Oh, I'm so glad your royal highness is with us again.

364
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,079
I hope your royal highness is not badly hurt. Oh.

365
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:08,400
Where am I?

366
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,640
In moment, Valiya, of course, stupid.

367
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
Where do you think?

368
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
That's weird.

369
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,039
I thought movement and I had gone for a walk in the lonely mountains.

370
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,640
Didn't we, movement?

371
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
Huh?

372
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,079
Do you remember who I am, Snorkmaden?

373
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,079
Movement?

374
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,799
What are you talking about, of course I do.

375
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,720
And you don't think you're a princess anymore?

376
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,960
Princess, have you gone crazy or something?

377
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,160
What princess, what do you mean, Moomin?

378
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,039
Hooray, she's back to normal.

379
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,240
Snorkemaiden's back to normal.

380
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,599
Yes, it's nice to have you back again.

381
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,000
Yes, it's wonderful. Welcome home.

382
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,200
What is? What's wonderful?

383
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,000
Have you all gone loopier or something? Never mind, Snorkemaiden.

384
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You bumped your head, that's all.

385
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And so Snorkemaiden's brief spell as a royal princess came to an end, except that she was the only one who didn't remember it.

386
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But everyone else in Woman Valley breathed a sigh of relief. release. They're always happy and always at play The movements are having fun day after day

387
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The movements

388
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The movements

389
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They love the laughter and they love the living

390
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The movements

391
00:22:42,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Believing and sharing and caring And giving the movements The moon is the moment.
