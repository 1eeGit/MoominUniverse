WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here they are for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land.

00:36.000 --> 00:46.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:46.000 --> 00:58.000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

01:17.000 --> 01:44.000
Captain Blood and his band of feared pirates had sailed the seas for many years,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
but never could he remember a storm such as this.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
He began to wonder whether his ship could withstand the battering and buffeting of the angry waves for much longer.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Alas, it is now too late to launch the lifeboat he thought, as he lashed himself to the wheel.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
His voice rose against the wind.

02:01.000 --> 02:08.000
Captain Blood can think of no better death than to journey to the bottom of the sea, losing the last battle against his old adversary.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
But if only I could see the life of the young and beautiful princess who I rescued from the dupe scallion before a ciker,

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
I care not about the three chests of doubloons, two chests of jewels and 36 bales of the richest and most colorful silks,

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
but oh must she too perish in this terrible storm.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Is it a good book, Moonman?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Mmm, it's great.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
What a terrible storm, it's not easing at all.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
No.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
I'm so glad I'm not on my own in a night like this.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I feel safe in Moonman's house.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Oh, what was that?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
It sounded like a tree breaking.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Hey, Moonman.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Mmm, why don't you read your story out loud?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Oh, okay.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
But can I start where I got to?

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
As long as you tell us what's happened before, we won't know what it's about, and we might have missed something important.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Just the main points will do, Moonman.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Well, there's this brave pirate.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
It's so much fun when someone reads out loud.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Go on, Moonman.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Captain Blood.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
And he and his men have captured a rich and royal gallery.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
They've taken lots of gold, silver, and jewels and things.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
And oh, yes, a princess too.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
It's exciting, isn't it?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Yes, it is.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
The storm that rose that night was so violent that at first,

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
it seemed inevitable the ship found before the waves had engulfed it.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Not bad, if I say so myself.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
Captain Blood saw that the poor princess had indeed swooned.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
With only the rats for company, how frightened she must have been down in the old.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
The noise of the storm was deafening as the ship was thrown above under swirling sea.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
The captain's brave heart went out to his young and beautiful captain.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Could I have some tea, Mama?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Of course, dear. Would you like me to bring it up to you?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
No, thanks. I've finished for the day.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
That's good. Shall we all have some tea and lemonade?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Yes, please. I'm very thirsty.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
You read very well. Thank you, Moonman.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Great story, isn't it?

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Could I have some strawberry juice, please, Mama?

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Snork Maiden, when is your brother coming home?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Oh, he didn't say exactly.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
But in a couple of days, I should think.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
It was a good idea to let Snork make him stay while he was away.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Wasn't it, Papa?

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
Yes, it wouldn't be very nice to be all on your own at night in a storm like this.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Not at all.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
She seems to be sinking.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
She won't be able to hold out much longer.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
We must get to the crew without delay.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
How could we launch a boat in this weather?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Any survivors?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
We haven't found anyone yet.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
So what about further along the coast?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Any reports of survivors turning up?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
No, I'm afraid not, Inspector. We haven't heard anything.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Well, tell me if you do.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Ah, Inspector?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Yes.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
It seems to me it was a pirate ship that sunk.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
What did you say?

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Well, I'm pretty sure I saw the skull and crossbones flying from the mast.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
And I think I caught sight of a cannon, but I could have been mistaken.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
You must be joking.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
I never joke.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I can't see anything.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
It's too far away to make out any sort of skull and crossbones.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Try this.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Ah, you've got a telescope.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Now why didn't you let me have this before? It might have helped.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Oh!

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Ah, that's it. She's gone.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
I suppose that there aren't many pirate ships around today.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
Any that are afloat must be so old that they'd probably break up easily.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
That's if it was a pirate ship, but it sure looked like one right enough.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Nothing's been washed up on the shore yet.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
No, not a thing.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Isn't it strange that I was reading that book about pirates yesterday?

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
They probably wouldn't be quite so romantic in real life.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
Well, in the book they were really great. I wish I'd been one.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
A pirate?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Yeah, what could be more exciting?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
You can't mean that.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
Oh, yes, I do. To sail across the seven seas, the holds of your ship's crowned with treasures.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
But you'd have to steal the treasure from somebody first, so, Moomin.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
Well, yes, all right. I suppose so.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
But I wouldn't steal anything from anyone.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Then you're just a sailor. Not a pirate at all.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Moomin, Mama, do you know where Moomin is?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
He's probably in Snuffkin's tent.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Oh, yes.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Nork Maiden, I have a letter for you.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Here you are. It's from the snork.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Oh, thank you. Wait a minute, little Mai.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I want to read Snork's letter.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Take your time.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Oh, what's the matter?

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
It's Snork. He's coming home today.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
That's nice.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
But Moomin, Mama, there's no food in the house at all.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Now, don't worry about that, Snork Maiden.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
I'll whistle up some dinner for us, and Snork can tell us all about his trip.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Boom and Papa like that.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Oh, thank you, Mama. Snork doesn't like missing his meals.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
He must have got the part sooner than he thought.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Ha! That's great news.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Then he should finish his flying ship soon, hey?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I guess so.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
He should make it into a pirate flying ship.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
I could be his first maid, and no one would be able to catch us.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Nobody at all!

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Not here.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
Oh, dear. I wonder where they've gone, little Mai.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
There's nobody here.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Moomin probably wanted to go looking for an adventure.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
I bet they went down to the beach to see if anything's been washed out.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
At least the hangar's not been damaged.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Let's go down to the beach. We may find a treasure chest.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Huh?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
What is it?

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
I just thought I heard something.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Where? From in there.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Hmm, weird.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Oh, I know. The snork must have come back.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Oh, yes. Snork. Of course.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Hello, Snork.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Oh, Snork? Are you in here?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Ah!

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Snork me!

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Put her down.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Oh, really? It was actually a pirate ship.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
It was indeed Moomin, Papa, and we caught the pirates when they swam ashore.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Do you think you captured all of them, Inspector?

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Well, of course, we don't know exactly how many there were to begin with.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Hmm, right.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
We better barricade ourselves in Moomin's house just to be on the safe side.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
Oh, dear. And I suppose I ought to stand guard over my greenhouse as well.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Lace me, ma'am. Come here, little panic.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Do let Snork me go. You'll be sorry. You great big hairy folly.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
No, not in your life, though. It's just my hostage. I need her to make good my escape, ma'am.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Then you only have yourself to blame.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Hey, what?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Blame? Stay where you are now. I will not be bitten again.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Keep away, little cat.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Well, don't hurt her then.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
Hurt her, you little shark. She's a hostage and I call me one of that.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
She'll be my safe passenger. These rough waters are perished.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Well, then you better take me instead.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Because I'm much easier to carry.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
You, huh? Nobody would care if I fed you slowly to the shrimps.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Oh, yes, lots of people. When you overstab win, ma'am.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
All right, all right. Hold your head with gloomy down. Now, what's your name, girl?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I'm Lil Mai.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
Well, I'm Captain Rumpod. Now, go and get whatever authorities you have in this backwater.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Hurry, my patience is short.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
I'll only go if you promise that you won't hurt Snork Maiden.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Of course, I won't.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
If I find that you've hurt her in any way at all, my revenge will be terrible.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
All right, all right, all right.

11:25.000 --> 11:33.000
Captain Rumpod, you are surrounded. Let Snork Maiden go.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Do you hear me, Captain?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
To a gold button-land lover like you never.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
She's a good-looking wench, fair skinned and nicely rounded.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
Pirates prefer blondes. Give me a ship and you can have her back.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
What do you say to let my buck-hole?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
You're on your own, Captain.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
We've got all your men locked up tight.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
All me crew?

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
You're the last one. Now, let her go immediately.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
Thank you for saving me crew. I feared they were all lost.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Don't thank me. They're all in jail.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
Someone's saying it's the best place for them, but not me.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Now, let them out. I need them. And a proper ship.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Oh, with two masks and fifty cannon. And no tricks.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Else, it'll be worse for the girl.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
This is too much.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
The school for constables didn't tell us about this.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
What should we do, Inspector?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Please get Snork Maiden away from him.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
I'm afraid he'll hurt her and she'll be frightened.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
I'm trying my best, but it's very awkward all this.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I've not come across anything like it before.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh, but it's not her fault that it's ship's anchor, Inspector.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
I know, I know. Oh, dear, oh dear.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Oh, I should have been a gardener.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Hey, are you still there, you ruffian?

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Let my men go and get my ship.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Two masks and fifty cannon mine.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Look, Captain Rumpod, I'm afraid that times have changed.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Sailing ships don't have cannon these days.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Shiver me timbers. How do you sink each other then?

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I don't try to fool me. Remember, I've got the girl.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
I think Moomin Papa has an old blender bus I'm sure he'll let you have.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
I don't know if it'll work, though. That's all I've got.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
I'm one of you, Peabrain. This is my final word, so listen well.

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
You have two hours to get the ship ready to sail and all my crew with her mine.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Or else I'll...

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Now, don't worry, my pretty one. I won't harm a single hair on your head,

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
but I must have something to threaten them with.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Or else I'll feed her to the hungry shot.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Ah!

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Oscar, I won't hurt you.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Are you sure?

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
Either I get my ship, Oak 50 cannon and at least two masters

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
you'll be food for lobsters. It's your choice, my hearty!

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I should do it.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
He sounds as if he'll do it, too.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Two hours, he says, the real feeder to the sharks. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
What will Snork say, oh, dear, oh, dear?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Ah!

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I have a great idea, sir.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
Why don't we climb onto the roof, drill a hole and then drop some on his head?

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
You know, Constable, I've always thought you were an idiot, now you've proved it.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Excuse me, Inspector.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
If we set fire to the henna, then they'll have to come out, won't they?

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
Shut up! Why am I surrounded by fools?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Oh, this is no good.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
I must calm down, I must calm down.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Captain Rumbot!

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Can you hear me, Captain?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Ah-ha, you found a ship already, have you?

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
Well, no, there aren't any real sailing ships in Moomin Valley.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
The chief Constable has a yacht.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
He doesn't usually let anyone borrow it, but I'm sure in this case he...

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
I want something big enough to take me to the Spanish main!

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
I warned you!

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
Calm down, Captain. Calm down. Now just listen to me.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
You haven't done anything wrong here. No pirating or such like.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
So if you forget about the boat, we'll let you all go. Think about it.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Free to go anywhere you like, on foot, of course.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
The fresh air, the sun on your face, no worry of shipwrecks, no storms at sea.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
What do you think we are?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Huh, we're pirates, not highwaymen.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
It's not so bad being a highwayman, you know.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
There'll be lots of rich travelers on the other side of Lonely Mountain, I'm sure.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
And lots of adventures with jewels and gold.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
Day me with flagens are rubbing a chicken brain, nitwit!

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Nitwit?

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
No, niggum poop, dumb bill! I'm Captain Rumpot!

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
You're making me very angry!

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
If I had you on my ship, you'd dangle from the yard. I mean, what the play?

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
The inspector's losing control. We had better call me down.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
What the clank would I, and then Mike prison you'd get no butter on their breath,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
and maggots on your biscuits?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Please calm down, Inspector.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
The pilot's there!

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
All right!

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Calm down, pick it easy!

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Are you sure?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
We water!

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I'd see through it that the bread was milled!

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
That's 30 minutes gone already!

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I warned you, gold button.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
But now there is only one hour to her painful and horrible death!

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
Cheer up, snark maiden! Try and hold on!

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
We'll get you out!

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Water!

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Water!

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Huh? What did you say?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Water, please. I'm so thirsty!

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Water?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Nasty stuff, still.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Hey, land lovers!

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Compliments to the galley! The young lady wants a drink!

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
All right, captain. I'm coming, smart maiden.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I'll take it, Inspector.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
It's too dangerous. You must leave it to us now, moment.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Just a minute, Inspector.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
I think we should let moment go, and I've got an idea that just might work.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Snuff him!

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
It'll take an awful lot of courage, and you'll have to do it all on your own.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Do you think you can do it, moment?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Of course.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
This place made me raise what's taken him so long, keeping a young lady waiting.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
It's all right. I really don't mind waiting.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Tell you the truth. I can do it and drink myself.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
It's thirsty work, shun an idiot policeman. Don't you worry, little one.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
They'll be here soon.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
Get me a drink, too, you hear, and quick about it!

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
I've brought you something to drink, captain.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
All right, come on, then. And no funny stuff.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Don't worry. I'm on my own.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Have you done a drink for me, too?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Yes, captain.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
All right, stay there and put down the tray.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
The bigger one is for you, captain, and the little one for snark maiden.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Now move away.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
And for enough, stay there.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
Hmm. Why is it so red?

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
Well, it's strawberry juice. It's very good.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
I'll be polite. She can drink from this one, and I'll have hers.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
But, captain, there's not enough for you in the small one.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
Strawberry juice isn't exactly my favorite tip of your know.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
No, the small one will do.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Here you are, young lady.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
No, no snark maiden. Please, don't drink it.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
Why not, my young bucko? It's not poison, is it?

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Don't be silly. Poisoned? Oh, no, no.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Perhaps a sleeping potion.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
Hmm. As I thought, I deemed in mighty strange that two cups were prepared.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
You drink it.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Oh, no, no, no, sir. I'm not thirsty at all.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
What's the matter, me lad? You said the drink wasn't poison, didn't you?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
So drink.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
No, man.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Ah, you're her swing, are you?

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
I shall never understand women anyway. One of you will have to drink it, and now.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Not her. I'll do it. I'll do it. Give it to me.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
No, woman, don't. There's something in it. You'll be poisoned.

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
It's all right, snark maiden. It's nothing dangerous. Don't worry about me.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I'll drink it.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
That's it. Drink up again.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Down the hatch, me lad.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
You're lucky and wasn't poisoned.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Yeah.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
And no sleeping potion, neither?

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
Oh, no, nothing at all. Nothing.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Oh, woman. Oh, no, woman.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
You're not my pretty one.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
Your wimpy little bow is just taking a nap. You'll be right as rain's soon.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
And he thought he could fool me.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
Me, Captain Rumpot, the cheek of it.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Well, I'll have the other one.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Not bad.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
No, I'm sorry, young lady. They'll have to bring you another.

20:39.000 --> 20:45.000
Shall we order one without the draft? They'll be surprised when they see me still on my pins.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
Why do I not sleep at all?

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Let's go and give my surprise.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Help!

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Oh, woman!

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
A woman!

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
It's all right. I'm okay snark maiden.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
There's nothing in this drink. Would you like some?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
A woman, you mean you?

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
Well, I was pretending. So I convinced you too, huh?

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
A woman!

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
Captain Rumpot didn't wake up that day, or the next.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
And when he did, he had a terrible headache, which served him right.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
The inspector let all the pirates go after a week.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Well, they hadn't done any pirating in Moomin Valley.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
And wouldn't be doing any either. Not without a ship.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
I'm sorry.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:08.000 --> 22:16.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
They're always happy and always at play.

22:20.000 --> 22:27.000
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
The movements.

22:31.000 --> 22:38.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:38.000 --> 22:45.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
They're always happy and always at play.

22:49.000 --> 22:56.000
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
The movements.

23:00.000 --> 23:06.000
The movements.
