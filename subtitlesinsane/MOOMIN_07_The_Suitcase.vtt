Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.579
They are the movements, they are the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.560
Moomin's bed.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.760
Snuffkin, as always, preferred to sleep in his tent.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.239
You remember what happened?

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.939
The horrible greek coming after thingamy and bob

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.639
and everything freezing?

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:27.000
For a moment, however, the night wasn't quite over yet. Mommy, papa! Help me! The girl gets after me!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:03:12.939
I can't run anymore! Oh, oh! Sniff!

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.039
Morning, Mama! Good morning, Moomin.

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:17.240
Is Sniff up yet?

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.319
Huh, you're joking.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.719
Where is the thing on the mampon?

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:22.439
They haven't stirred yet.

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.000
The poor things are tired out.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Papa's not still asleep, is he? No, he's looking at my rose bushes.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Are they okay, Papa?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
No, frozen to death and look.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
What?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
That's where she was standing over there with a grass is dead.

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.840
She must have been real cold to freeze the roses.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.360
What a shame, they were very pretty.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.120
Well, there's not much left of them now.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.000
We'll have to grow some new ones.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.599
I dreamed that she was chasing me, Papa.

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.199
Oh, don't worry, moment.

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.280
I think she's only after thing of me and Bob.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.000
So there are not fugitives from justice after all?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I have a feeling that they would prefer that moment.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Aren't thing of Ian Bob coming down?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Yes, if they could have breakfast in their room if you didn't mind.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Well, what did they tell you?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.279
What? About why the greek is chasing them.

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:30.800
Oh, they just looked terrified and wouldn't say anything

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.560
about her at all.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.680
You know, we really ought to find out why.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.519
Yes, you're right.

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:39.720
Mum and Mum, why don't you take their breakfast up

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.240
and see if they'll tell you anything

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:57.199
if any of us can get it out of the mukeh.

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.000
Who's that?

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.300
It's only me. I've brought you both a nice breakfast. Well, what did they say?

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.000
It seems that the greek is after the suitcase, not them.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I wonder what's in it! Perhaps they've stolen her mummy as well!

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And they also said that it did use to belong to her.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Oh dear, if they've stolen it...

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I don't know about that.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I asked them how they got it, but they wouldn't say another word.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.199
Well, this is too much.

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.199
We could be harboring criminals.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.199
I know they don't look like it, but you never know, do you?

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:52.699
You can ask the girls!

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:54.699
Shh! Don't shout!

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.199
No, that's no good.

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.500
We don't want to come back here most definitely.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.000
Let's ask the police inspector to question them.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
We don't want to get the police involved. Well, you'll suggest something, Anne. Quint, shouting, sniff.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Look, why don't you just wait for them to tell you, Moomin?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I know it seems strange, but I've noticed that if you pretend not to be interested,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
people can't wait to tell you those secrets.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
They told Mama about the suitcase, but they wouldn't say anything to Papa.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
You know something, Moomin. People can't wait to tell you their secrets. They told Mama about the suitcase, but they wouldn't say anything to Papa.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
You know something, Moomin?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
They might open up to Snork Maiden.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
She's someone more their own age.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
You could be right.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Hey, Snork Maiden!

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Where are you going?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Moomin house.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I'll come with you.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
But I thought you were living there.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I was until mumble came back yesterday.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
How is she?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Bossie, and she snores too.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Woman!

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Snorke maiden.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Where are you off to?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Well, I was just on my way to see you.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Oh, that's so nice, and I've come to see you, Moomin.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I brought you a little present, Moomin.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
A present for me.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Yes, and it's very beautiful.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
What is it?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Something you must never break or lose.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I promise I won't.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
There you are.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Thank you.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Go on, open it.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.600
A lot of beautiful shell!

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.800
I spent all of yesterday on the beach searching for it, just for you.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.199
Look, we can see ourselves in it.

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.399
So we can!

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:41.399
Thank you very much, Snorkmade, it's my heart, and I want you to look after me.

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:43.399
Oh, I will, Snorkmade, and I will.

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:45.600
I'll think of you whenever I look at it.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.199
I'll move in.

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:49.680
I promise you that I'll always kiss the shell

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.879
before I go to sleep.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.079
It will be my most precious treasure.

00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:57.040
Apart from me?

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:00.720
So what shall I do?

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.920
Take them for a walk?

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:05.000
Yes, but take your time and don't rush them.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I'll let them cry on my shoulder.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Yes, and try and talk to them as well, though.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I feel very important and a little bit nervous, too.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Have some tea first.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Thank you, Mum and Mama.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.399
Ah!

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:31.600
We don't need your help, Little My. Ha, that's what you think.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.600
I'd be able to weedle out their secrets.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.600
It's not an interrogation.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.600
We only want to talk to them, you know?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.200
So you can weedle out their secrets.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.399
I'll be very quiet.

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:44.000
Little My, have you ever managed to be very quiet?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Not really, but there's only one way to find out.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
You must let me go with Snork Maiden.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
No, this situation needs a tender understanding, one.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
That's me, exactly!

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
You ready? I suppose so.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Hello, it's Moomin. Can I talk to you for a minute?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Hello? This is Snorth Maiden. She's a very good friend of mine.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Hello, I'm very happy to meet you both.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
She's very tender and understanding and she'd like to talk to you. Can she come in?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.600
Well, if she has to, moment.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200
Come in, then.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Yippee-yippee-yippee-yippee.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.200
It's very beautiful, a perfect heart shape.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I've never seen anything like it, moment.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Would you like one, Mama?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
No, my dear. There should only be one shell like this.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Then would you keep it somewhere safe for me?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Well, self-kin.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I'm sure Snorkmaiden will get it out of him.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I do hope so. I think they like it or anyway.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I have a feeling in my bones that Groke will be back tonight.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Oh.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
If we could find out why she's after them, we'd know what to do.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Mama won't have any garden left if that monster comes back every night.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Moment.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Hmm? Move it. Move it. Huh? Well done.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Snork maiden.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Little Mai!

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Oh no, she'll ruin everything if we don't stop her.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
If you win the fear, I'll be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
ruin the fear.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I'll be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who Oh no, she'll ruin everything if we don't stop her.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
If you win to fear a little, my I'll never forgive you.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
What? Interfear? Me? Never.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Look, let's just leave it up to snork maiden now, little my.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
You'll need me of snork maiden that tend to and understanding enough.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Hey, moment!

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So, how is snork maiden getting on her taking them for a stroll? and understanding enough. Hey, moment!

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So, how is Snorkmaiden getting on her,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
taking them for a stroll?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Where are they?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
If we were narrow...

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Papa, if we get much closer...

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And the last thing we want is for them to see us.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Looks like I'll have to go and talk to them. You're all too big.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I'll come back later and tell you what they said.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
No, don't. You'll upset Snorkmaiden.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
You're the one who's upsetting her!

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Shh!

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
All right. Can I ask you again about the suitcase?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Yes!

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.200
Does that suitcase belong to you or is it the Groaks?

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.200
No!

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.200
Yes!

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.799
Let's try it another way.

00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:54.799
Who's is that suitcase?

00:11:54.799 --> 00:11:56.500
It's ours, it's ours!

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.600
But you told Mum and Mama that it wasn't yours?

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.000
It was the Groaks!

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.500
Yes, we did!

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.000
Oh... that it wasn't yours? It was the Groakes! Yes, we did!

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Oh, do you mind if I ask you one more time?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Please do!

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Right, here we go.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Now all I want is a simple yes or no.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Is that suitcase yours or not?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
No, yes!

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Oh, take your time, Snorkmaine, and don't rush them, he said.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
What was that, Snorkmaine?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Look, I'm sorry, but can I ask you again?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Yes, as many times as you want.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Thank you. This is the very last time, so please tell me the truth.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:52.080
Now then, the suitcase. Yes, you know which one? Yes. Does it belong to you? Yes, it does.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:58.399
So it's not the Grookes. Yes, it is not the Grookes. At last we're getting somewhere, praise the

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:07.000
booble. We're very happy for you. Snork maiden is really having to work hard. I wouldn't have, I'd scare them into talking.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.399
You should have let me go.

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:10.639
Yeah, but we wanted someone gentle.

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:12.919
Snork maiden is nice.

00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:16.120
Everybody in this house is nice.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.120
Do you think they'd let us stay here forever?

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.120
Of course. If we can keep away from the grog.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.519
Mm-hmm.

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:27.000
It took a long time, but in the end they trusted me,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and now we're good friends.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Who wouldn't trust you and want to be good friends?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Thank you.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
It wasn't easy, though. They kept speaking together,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and I got rather muddled.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
But they did tell me somehow.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Rather muddled. I told you, guys, you should've let me do it.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Oh, I'm afraid I didn't get very much, though. I knew you guys you should let me do it. Oh I'm afraid I didn't get very much though.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
I knew you wouldn't.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So what did you find out then, Snork Maiden?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Tell us.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Well, first of all, the suitcase does seem to be theirs.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
That was one thing they made very clear.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Lennel can the grog.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Just a minute, Moomin.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
What's in the suitcase on the other hand belongs to the grog.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.960
That's the problem.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.799
Oh dear, so they do have something belonging to a...

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:12.399
Well, Snork Maiden, what is it?

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:14.799
They wouldn't tell me what it is little my,

00:14:14.799 --> 00:14:17.799
only that it is the most beautiful thing in the world.

00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:19.039
How is it?

00:14:19.039 --> 00:14:20.440
I wonder.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.240
This is very difficult to understand.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.000
I mean, thingy and bob don't look like thieves at all, do they?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So, the gropes just wanted back what is hers?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I don't see how that big ugly monster could own the most beautiful thing in the world.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Well, what they said was that she just happened to have it.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
They didn't say whether it belonged to her or not.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
So she might have stolen it herself.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.360
They shouldn't have taken it, though.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.559
Oh dear, oh dear.

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:50.440
Bob and Thingamy are very frightened

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.080
of how she'll take her revenge if she catches them.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.200
But they're very determined to keep what's

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.240
in the suitcase, Moomin, Papa.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.360
Oh, this is a fine mess, indeed.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.440
The gropes should have come back tonight.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.639
What can we do?

00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:06.000
What can we do? What can we do? What can we do?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.200
We can do the same as before.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.500
Yeah, but it's not fair to drive her away.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.799
If what's in the suitcase really does belong to her?

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:15.799
She means to get the suitcase

00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:19.200
and I don't think it will be so easy to get rid of her this time.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.000
And if she stays, we'll have a never-ending winter.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Well, I'll cover up the petunias just in case.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Are you all going to stay here?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I'll look after Snork.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I will, Mum and Mama, I'll stay.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
You'll stay, won't you, Snuffkin?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Don't look so clam, everyone. I've got an idea.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
But it would help if we knew what was in that suitcase.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
But even if we didn't, it could still work.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Uh, what is it, dear?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.480
Just wait, Papa. You'll see.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:16:26.000
Ha-ha-ha. I Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Oh, my God.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Oh, my God.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Oh, my God.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Oh, my God.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Oh, my God.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Oh, my God.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Oh, my God.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Oh, my God.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Oh, my God.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:17:03.419
Oh, my God. Oh, I hope women Papa can do something.

00:17:03.419 --> 00:17:05.000
It's your girl, little mom. Yes, I know.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
There's the king and the queen.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Uh, this one?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Uh...

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Uh-oh, uh-oh, she's coming.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Just when I was winning.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
You better hide under the table, little mom.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Don't be stupid.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:31.000
How can I hit her with my roll and pin from there.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Where is she, Papa? Exactly where she was yesterday.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
I'll go for a toast, alright, Papa?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Let me go first, and then the rest of you can fan out behind me.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Moment, Mama.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.359
What is it, papa?

00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:48.000
Perhaps now's the time to tell us your idea.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.359
We haven't long.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.000
Wait, Grog. Don't go know. We want to talk to you.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000
We know that you've come back to get what thing of me and Bob took from you.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
That is right, isn't it?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Won't you let them keep it, perhaps?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.200
No, we'll you sell it to them?

00:18:28.759 --> 00:18:29.759
Oh, dear.

00:18:30.839 --> 00:18:34.920
I have some very beautiful things here in my bag.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.920
Maybe you'd like to trade, Groke.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
What about this pendant? Isn't it lovely? So you don't like that? What about this then?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Or this?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Oh. Or this?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Oh. All right. Why don't you choose?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Take anything you want from my handbag, except the hair slide.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Which one do you want, this one? Let me see with this.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Oh, this one?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Oh, dear, that's not really mine to give to you.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Snork maiden gave that to Mumen.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.119
Is it all right if I give the shell to her

00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:53.599
Mumann? Oh Mum! You'll never allow! Are you all right? Yes, my hand was suddenly frozen.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:07.279
No, you've got the shell Mrs. Groke. Do you promise not to come back anymore? Because I'll get you if you do!

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.000
Well, that was a close thing. I'm glad that's over.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Oh, you were marvelous, Mama.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I'm so sorry, Moomin.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
I forgot that I had put your precious shell in my handbag to keep it safe.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
It's all right, Mama. You gave it in a good cause.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
What snorkman gonna say, Moomin?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
I heard you. You said you'd never go to sleep without kissing it.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Or something equally stupid.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Well, I'm not gonna tell Snork maiden,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
but I think Mama did the right thing.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
She'll find out. I'm fed up with secrets.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:07.000
I'm always gonna tell the truth from now on, no matter what. Oh!

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Oh!

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Oh!

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Mumin, Mumin! Look! I found one! Really?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Well, it's very similar, but the one snort maiden gave me was much bigger.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.319
Oh, a lot bigger, was it?

00:21:26.319 --> 00:21:30.200
Mumen had decided that he had to find a shell that was exactly the same as the one snork

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.599
maiden had given him.

00:21:31.599 --> 00:21:35.319
Then with luck, she would never find out what he'd done with it.

00:21:35.319 --> 00:21:37.319
Oh.

00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:40.319
Oh.

00:21:40.319 --> 00:21:43.319
Oh.

00:21:43.319 --> 00:21:44.319
Oh.

00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:46.000
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Oh, I'm sorry. Valley, miracles do happen.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
They're always happy and always at play.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
The movements.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
The movements.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:40.000
They love the laughter and they love the living.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:51.599
The movements You're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:55.200
They're always happy and goes and played

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.799
The movements are having fun day after day

00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:02.500
The movements

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:12.000
The movements The moment, the moment, the moment.
