1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They are the movements, there are the movements,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,439
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just

8
00:00:37,439 --> 00:01:47,000

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Oops!

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Sign on my mama!

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We weren't looking where we were going.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's all right. Oops! Sign on my mama! We weren't looking where we were going.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's all right.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Here's your bag.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Thank you, thingamy.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Are you going out?

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes, for a walk.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We'll have fun.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,759
It seems that thingamy and Bob are well and truly part of movement house now.

20
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:31,340
Luckily they don't eat a lot and are small enough to find the pencils that fall between

21
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,840
the floorboards in the porch.

22
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Hey, this looks like a great hiding place.

23
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Nobody would ever find it here.

24
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,000
Come on Bob, let's go get the suitcase, then.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Are you sure it's not safe for an alarm?

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What would you say if someone went in when we went there?

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You wouldn't like it, would you?

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I think the movements are much too nice to do anything like that.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,599
It's not them. It's the guests I'm thinking about.

30
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,599
You know the movements let anybody stay.

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,400
Snork Maiden.

32
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,639
You lied to me little Mai.

33
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,840
Who me?

34
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,319
Moments still house the shell that I gave him,

35
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,319
but you said that he didn't.

36
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,560
Impossible.

37
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,639
Mom and Mama gave it to the groke.

38
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,439
I was there when she did it.

39
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,680
Look, I saw it.

40
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,120
He showed it to me.

41
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,479
Are you really sure?

42
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,819
Was it the same one?

43
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,000
Of course it was.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm not stupid, you know.

45
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,259
That's very odd.

46
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,719
I saw her do it with my own eyes.

47
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,120
Well, I'll go and ask Moomin' right now, little my.

48
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,680
It's a bit awkward, but if I'm going to be honest,

49
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,319
Snork Maiden, what?

50
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,479
Well, I've decided that from now on,

51
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,439
I'm only gonna tell the truth.

52
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,280
Oh yes.

53
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,000
And I found something you might be interested in.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,400
Well, what is it?

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,360
Mungle and I were down on the beach yesterday,

56
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,719
and you remember all those things

57
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,400
we found washed up by the storm?

58
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,840
Do you mean on the Hattie Fatter's island

59
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
that we sailed to?

60
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,780
Yes, and do you remember the figurehead

61
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,580
that Moomin liked best of all?

62
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,580
You know, the lady made of wood and painted.

63
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,979
She was really lovely, wasn't she?

64
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:16,379
Yes, I remember.

65
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:17,980
Moomin wanted to keep it.

66
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,220
So what about it?

67
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,819
Well, it's here on the beach.

68
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:26,319
It was still the same as beautiful as ever. Was it the same one?

69
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,319
Yes, I remember her pretty face.

70
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,839
No legs, though.

71
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,800
She's just a silly wooden doll.

72
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,079
Oh, I know that, but she's got those gorgeous eyes in lovely long hair.

73
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,360
Little my why all this fuss about this silly figurehead.

74
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,560
Trust him, only someone as stupid as Moonwin could fall in love with a figurehead.

75
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,319
It's probably still dreaming about her every night.

76
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,079
Do you think it's still there?

77
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,519
Jaros Nork Maiden, if no one else has found her already.

78
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,879
Do you think the ocean might come and wash her away again?

79
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,759
Why all these silly questions, Snork Maiden?

80
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,879
Moonwin would go and rescue her if he knew.

81
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,879
So?

82
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,279
That would be terrible.

83
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,000
I couldn't bear it at all.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I really couldn't.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,439
How pathetic.

86
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,279
He'll probably take her home and keep her in his room forever.

87
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,560
My expect she's too big to go through the door.

88
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,120
He'll just sit and stare at her with that lovesick look

89
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,879
on his face.

90
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,120
I know he will.

91
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,800
Oh!

92
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,040
Where are you going now?

93
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,000
I thought you were going to a moment house!

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I was, but there's something more important I have to do!

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay, it's Chris!

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Hey you two, you're not leaving, are you? No, we're just, uh, we're going. Why have you got the suitcase, then? Look, women, would you help us with something?

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Of course.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Thank you very much, women.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh, that's okay.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's a bit too big for you to carry.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We can take it from here.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's all right.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's not too big.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's not too big. It's a bit too big for you to carry.

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We can take it from here.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's all right. It's not very heavy.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, silly me. It wouldn't be a very secret place if I'd seen it. Would it?

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll see you later. Don't be too long now.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm sorry, won't tell anyone, will ya?

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Of course I won't.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
H-h-h-h. Ooooooh.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Ooooooh.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Ooooooh.

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Ooooooh.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hey!

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What are you doing up there, little my?

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm coming down.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What does it look like?

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're much too small to do that.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The rungs are too far apart for you to reach.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Just you watch me!

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Mumin, I have a problem.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Do you mind if I ask you something?

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Go ahead.

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Did Mum and Mama give Snorkman's heart shape shell to the grove?

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes, she did.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So you and the grove can't both have it, can you?

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's just where you're wrong.

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But that's simply impossible. You can't have.

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The grove simply got another one.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's not true.

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
All right, but it would only upset Snork,

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
made him if she knew.

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So I'm not going to tell her.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You rotten thing.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Why don't you just tell me the truth?

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Because it's a secret.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But I want to know, Moomin!

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Look, Moomin!

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Now, why don't you tell me your secret

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and then I'll tell you mine?

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What is it?

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,079
Really very top secret. Go on then, tell me. secret and then I'll tell you mine. What is it? Really very top secret.

144
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,519
Go on then tell me.

145
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,920
Tell me yours first.

146
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,319
No, you tell me first.

147
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,439
I know, let's say them together.

148
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,079
All right, ready?

149
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,720
One, two, three.

150
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,319
After we go and show them to the beach,

151
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,560
I'd be right over there.

152
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
We'll find something they can do.

153
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,399
Please, so I'll make the bigger head.

154
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,000
Play with the other one just like it., so I'll have the bigger head for that one.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Just like it.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,500
What did you say? The figure head?

157
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes, by the K.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Wait a minute. You didn't finish telling me your secret.

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll tell you later.

160
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's not there. You've got to tell me now! What do you think, Moments, do you want?

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't know. Maybe he's looking for shells again.

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't think so. He looks a bit worried to me.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Maybe he's lost something important.

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
How much further do we have to go?

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
As far as you can road.

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We're a long way out already, you know.

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I want to make sure that the lady will never turn up again.

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We must go further out.

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We must be far enough by now. I'm tired.

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No! The curds could still drag her in from here. Keep going! He looks very unhappy. We've got to cheer him up. But how?

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He's only one way, Bob.

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes, you're right, thingamy.

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hello?

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Look so sad, moment.

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That we thought we turned out to be a little bit more sad.

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But I'm not sure if you're going to be happy.

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm not sure if you're going to be happy.

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm not sure if you're going to be happy. Hello. Look so sad, Moment. But we thought we'd try and make you happy again.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You don't mind, do you?

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No, but you don't have to.

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm alright, really.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How about this, then, Moment?

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We can show you what's in our suitcase.

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Cool.

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Would you like that moment?

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's very interesting.

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sure you'll like it.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sure you'll like it.

189
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm sure you'll like it. I'm sure you'll like it. I'm sure you'll like it. I'm sure you'll like it. I'm sure you'll like it. How about this, Dan Norman? We can show you what's in our suitcase.

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Would you like that moment? It's very interesting.

191
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Oh my gosh! Will you?

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Uh-huh.

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Do you need some help in there?

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No, I think we can manage. Uh-oh!

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Thank you, woman!

196
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Now we'll open it.

197
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes, now. One, two, three.

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
One, two, three.

199
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, gosh!

200
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
By my tail.

201
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Do you like it?

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh, boy, do I like it? Then you're not sad anymore, woman. Gosh, by my tail.

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Dear Leica! Oh boy, do I like it then you're not sad anymore, man?

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh no! That's good, isn't it?

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes, very good!

206
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It was such a beautiful ruby!

207
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,759
How it changed color from soft red to soft blue

208
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,919
and then to pink?

209
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,759
One minute it was like a flame leaping out of the center.

210
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,080
Then suddenly it was like a black tulip.

211
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,919
It was...

212
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,279
Hmm, perhaps that's the King's Ruby.

213
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,720
It was just beautiful.

214
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,120
That's the one the hobgoblin' is searching for.

215
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,679
Oh, no.

216
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,000
However far away he is, he'll come back on his black panther, looking for it.

217
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,600
And he's sure to find it, because he'll know that thing of me and Bob have it.

218
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,000
First the Groke and allow the hobgoblin. What are we going to do?

219
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,000
No more than a week later, and like a bolt from the blue, a real catastrophe hit Mumen Valley.

220
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
No, it's not in the bedroom either.

221
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh, that's very odd. Where did you see it last?

222
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sure it was here somewhere, Papa.

223
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh, well, perhaps it's in the garden.

224
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,399
No, I haven't been out here all day.

225
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,519
Moomin' Mama's handbag is missing.

226
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,639
Full of useful things like socks and sweets and string.

227
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,759
What's the matter, Mama?

228
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:23,480
I can't find my handbag and I'm lost without it.

229
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,679
We've looked everywhere.

230
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,840
Will I get a reward if I find it, Moomin' Mama? I can't find my handbag and I'm lost without it. We've looked everywhere. Will I get a reward if I find it, Mom and Mama?

231
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,399
Yes, we'll have a big party for everyone with cakes, jelly, and everything.

232
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,039
And as a special treat, no one has to wash or go to bed early.

233
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,039
I'll find it, Mama.

234
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,039
No, I will.

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Mom and Mama, I've checked the cellar. It's not there. Oh, dear, where could it be? I haven't been in the cellar for days, so I didn't think it would be there,

236
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
but thank you, dear Snork.

237
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Word got round movement valley of the missing handbag.

238
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm not going to be there.

239
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm not going to be there.

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm not going to be there.

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm not going to be there.

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm not going to be there.

243
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm not going to be there. I'm not going to be there. Where'd got round, Moon Valley of the missing handbag?

244
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And soon everyone was helping to look for it.

245
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What a lot of people!

246
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I would do what they're looking for.

247
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What's everybody looking for? My handbag, thingamy.

248
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The one with the two nice little pockets?

249
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,559
Yes, that's the one.

250
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,120
It's been missing for days.

251
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,000
Will you two help us look?

252
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It needs such a lovely place to sleep and don't you think?

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Woman, mama looks very sad.

254
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Perhaps we better give it back. Oh, you found it!

255
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Look, everybody, think of me and Bob have found it!

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh, thank you!

257
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Where on earth did you find it?

258
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
In the bush under the water.

259
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh, you found it! Look, everybody! Think of me and Bob have found it! Oh, thank you! Where on earth did you find it? In the bush under the white birch tree.

260
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's a very, very nice handbag!

261
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Let's have a party tonight to celebrate the return of Mama's Handbag.

262
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
As you all know, this party is in honor of thing of he and Bob,

263
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
finding movement Mama's Handbag,

264
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,960
and to thank everyone who took part in the big circle. As you all know, this party is in honor of Thingamy and Bob finding Mumin Mama's handbag

265
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,080
and to thank everyone who took part in the big search.

266
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,240
Let's raise our glasses to our heroes, just to Thingamy and Bob, who found Mumin Mama's

267
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,480
handbag without which Mumin Valley would never be the same again.

268
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:14,000
Cheers! Now I think moment would like to say a few words, moment.

269
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We're very pleased that Mom is handbagged back again.

270
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And thank you to our Northern friends, Thingamian Bob.

271
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You're seeing as how this is a very special occasion

272
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,919
and also as a thank you for the party,

273
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,720
they have decided to show us what is in their suitcase,

274
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,159
and I'm sure you'll all be astounded by what you see.

275
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,320
Ha!

276
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,600
Come closer, everyone.

277
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,559
Now, sing a me and Bob. Are you ready?

278
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,960
Ready, everyone?

279
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,980
Ready, everyone?

280
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,000
One, two, three! Ooh!

281
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
How wonderful!

282
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I don't know how the globe could swap that for an old seashell!

283
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:06,000
By my, that must be the King's Ruby. I found it. It's a hand-dumbing!

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yes!

285
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
This is it.

286
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The Ruby I've sworn to find.

287
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Huh?

288
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I found it.

289
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The King's Ruby.

290
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I found it.

291
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's a hand-dumbing!

292
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yes!

293
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yes! This is it. It's the Hub Goblin!

294
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes, this is it. The Ruby I've sworn to find. Huh? Don't touch it! It's ours!

295
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Go away, you nasty Hub Goblin!

296
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But that King's Ruby belongs only to me!

297
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No, it doesn't. The Groke gave it to sing a me and Bob in fear exchange for a heart-shaped shell, Mr. Hub Goblin.

298
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,960
Did he say a heart-shaped shell? I think so.

299
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,559
Anyway, I saw her give it to them with my own eyes.

300
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,080
So it belongs to them, not you.

301
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,440
I've spent 300 years day and night searching everywhere for this ruby.

302
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, that's very sad, but it still is.

303
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Now then, let's see. Would you exchange the ruby for say to diamond mines?

304
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No! We don't mind anything now!

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No. I can't do it. I can't take it by force.

306
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's been so long. What can I do?

307
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Would you like some punch? It's very nice.

308
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's very kind of you, woman, mama.

309
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I haven't had any for 85 years.

310
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Ah, quince.

311
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's part of it, Mr. Hobgoblin.

312
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Have some more, please.

313
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
No, thank you. Hobgoblins don't really drink very much.

314
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Well, this is a splendid bunch and a splendid party. Have some more, please. No, thank you. Hobgoblins don't really drink very much.

315
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,680
Well, this is a splendid punch and a splendid party.

316
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,440
In return, I shall show you a little magic.

317
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,920
I will give out three presents.

318
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,319
Now what I can do is grant three wishes,

319
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:21,720
so I want three of you to come forward and make a wish.

320
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,559
You're not afraid, are you?

321
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,240
How you look old enough not to be frightened, Mr. Emulan? Just let me think.

322
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,240
Oh, yes, Mr. Hobb Goblin. I broke the spade I borrowed from Mum and Papa.

323
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,640
No, Mr. Himmelan, have you ever make a proper wish?

324
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,279
I would like a new spade, if you please.

325
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,000
Very well, here you are.

326
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Hobb-Coblin.

327
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Here you are, a moment, Papa.

328
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Right, who's next?

329
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Excuse me?

330
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yes, and what can I do for you, young lady?

331
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Well, I'm afraid it might be a little difficult.

332
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,839
For me?

333
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,960
Is that really what you want?

334
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,839
Please.

335
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,920
All right, then close your eyes.

336
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,160
Your wish has now come true, young lady.

337
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,359
Oh.

338
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,559
Oh, snork, mate.

339
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,039
Oh, snork, mate, El.

340
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,599
I've wanted eyes like that wouldn't lay to you think it's so beautiful.

341
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,400
Do you think I'm beautiful now, Mumann?

342
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,000
Well, I, well, um, give me a mirror, someone.

343
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They're quite nice, really.

344
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Huh? Huh?

345
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This is horrible, horrible!

346
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Please, Mr. Hobgoblin, please give me my eyes back!

347
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm sorry, but I can only grant one wish per person.

348
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh, that's really me! No, please!

349
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Mr. Hobgoblin, can I make a wish now?

350
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,500
Certainly. A golden chariot, a rock crystal goblet, anything at all.

351
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,099
A sack full of gold coins, you can be rich, Moomin, really rich.

352
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:15,599
I'm sorry, but Moomin's is the last wish.

353
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,000
I know, why don't you ask for two sackfuls of gold, Moomin?

354
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,500
Then we can have one each, what do you think?

355
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,099
No, Sniff, I know what I'm going to wish.

356
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,000
Oh man. Mr. Hobb Goblin, please change Sn I know what I'm going to wish. Oh, man.

357
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Mr. Hubgublin, please change Snork Maiden's eyes back to her own.

358
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Never mind her, she can see all right. Get the gold coins.

359
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The wish is made and fulfilled.

360
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
There you are. Have a look.

361
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Oh!

362
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Now next time, think before you make a wish.

363
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Moments.

364
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Mr. Howe Goblin?

365
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yes, think of me.

366
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
If you regret wishes like that, why don't you make a wish for yourself?

367
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm afraid my magic only works for other people.

368
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,839
Mr. Howe Goblin, can we make a wish for you then?

369
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,039
Please, here we can't.

370
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:07,539
Please.

371
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:08,940
I suppose so.

372
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,839
Oh, please.

373
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,339
It's important.

374
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:14,380
Very well, as it is not for you.

375
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,140
We wish for a movie just like yours.

376
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,380
You shall have it.

377
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This is for you, hot goblin. Oh, thank you.

378
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Thank you.

379
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,279
And so that was how, after 300 years, the Hobgoblin search came to an end,

380
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,200
and Mumen Valley had never had such a celebration.

381
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,039
Everyone was happy, except possibly sniff,

382
00:21:53,039 --> 00:22:15,000
who would have quite liked a sack full of gold coins. They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements

383
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements

384
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
They're always happy and always at play.

385
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

386
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The movements.

387
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The movements.

388
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They love the laughter and they love the living.

389
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:51,519
The movements. the movements believing and sharing and caring and giving the movements

390
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,039

391

392
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,240
the movements

393

the movements The moment, the moment, the moment.
