0	18600	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come.
18600	26880	Come on and sit down here with me, they're for you on your TV, they are the movements,
26880	29880	they are the movements.
29880	36120	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.
36120	44480	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were
44480	55840	the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,
55840	58840	there were the movements.
85840	99040	Fall has come to movement valley and the memory of sunshine filled ours fades as the days
99040	101840	become shorter and the nights longer.
101840	107040	The wind blows away the falling leaves and the blue skies of summer are now grey and
107040	111040	cloudy, winter is just around the corner.
111040	114040	Snork maiden!
114040	119040	Where are you going?
119040	125040	Oh I'm just taking my brother, his lunch little my, he must have nearly finished the flying
125040	126040	ship by now.
126040	130040	Oh no, not even snork works that quickly.
130040	132040	Well have you seen it?
132040	135040	No I haven't, he won't even let me come into his workshop.
135040	137840	Is he afraid it'll disappear if someone sees it?
137840	142320	He hasn't said why but I suppose all great inventors have to be very careful, someone
142320	145040	might want to steal their ideas.
145040	152040	The woman told me he's dying to have a look at it.
152040	163040	Hey woman, open the door, I've got my hands full, come on quickly.
163040	170040	Look what I've got, it's a regular player.
171040	177040	Oh.
177040	180040	Do you think you can get it working dear?
180040	182040	Oh yes of course mom.
182040	186040	Why do people always give me things that are broken, it'd be nice to have something that
186040	190040	worked for a change.
190040	193040	Movement probably will get it working for you.
193040	198040	My auntie said that the record was alright though it stands music, she's had it for ages
198040	199040	but I've never heard it.
199040	203040	Oh that's nice, it's years since I danced but it seems like only yesterday.
203040	206040	Do you remember what fun it was Papa?
206040	208040	Dancing.
208040	210040	Oh yeah, I see.
210040	213040	Have you fixed it Papa?
221040	222040	Huh?
222040	223040	I can hear music.
223040	226040	Doesn't sound like snuffkin.
229040	256040	Right, have you got the idea now?
256040	258040	Yes I think so.
258040	260040	Me too.
260040	265040	Come on, let's see you then.
265040	268040	What?
268040	271040	Did I do it?
271040	279040	Oh wow.
279040	285040	Look at Papa woman, he's a great dancer.
289040	294040	Well then, can you dance snuff?
294040	296040	I've never tried.
296040	300040	Right, well try now.
301040	306040	Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
306040	309040	Yep.
310040	315040	Hi, yeah.
315040	318040	Hi, hi.
318040	322040	Hey, hey.
322040	327040	Hi, hey, hey, hey, hey.
327040	332040	Oh that was fun.
332040	335040	Oh, dancing never used to wear me out like this.
335040	338040	You've got no sense of rhythm at all, Snuff.
338040	341040	It's still dance though, can't I?
341040	343040	Oh, are you ready, Papa?
343040	345040	I think I'll have to sit this one out, Mama.
345040	347040	All right.
350040	351040	You all right?
351040	352040	No, thank you.
352040	353040	I'll dance on my own.
353040	356040	Well then, why don't you dance with me and dance, Smith?
356040	358040	Ah.
363040	365040	Hmm.
365040	367040	Oh.
369040	373040	Oh, it looks like it's here for the day.
383040	386040	Oh, what horrible weather, snuffkin.
386040	388040	Yes.
388040	389040	They're having fun.
389040	393040	Well, Smith brought this old record player over and we've been dancing.
393040	395040	I haven't done it for years and years.
395040	397040	Well, aren't you coming in?
397040	399040	I can smell winter in the air, Moomin, Papa.
399040	401040	Huh?
401040	403040	Oh, yes.
403040	404040	Yeah, all right.
410040	412040	Snuffkin, why?
418040	420040	Snuffkin, come and dance with me.
420040	421040	No, thanks.
428040	429040	Sorry.
429040	431040	I'm sorry.
431040	432040	Oh, you.
438040	441040	Hmm, what's the matter with this?
446040	447040	I'm afraid it's broken.
447040	449040	Just when we were having so much fun.
449040	451040	Will you be able to fix it again, dear?
451040	453040	No, even I can't mend it now.
453040	455040	Oh, please, try, Papa.
455040	456040	Will you?
456040	460040	Hmm, snuffkin, do you know anything about record players?
460040	462040	No, I'm afraid not.
462040	463040	Oh, dear.
463040	464040	But what?
464040	467040	I'll play my harmonic if you want to continue to dance.
467040	469040	And then you can fiddle around with the machine.
469040	470040	How would that be?
470040	471040	Oh, yes, please.
471040	473040	That'd be great, snuffkin.
473040	474040	Thanks.
474040	476040	Now then, what would be a good tune to dance to?
476040	477040	Let's see.
486040	488040	Oh, no.
496040	497040	Oh, no.
510040	512040	Now what's this?
512040	514040	Oh, no.
514040	515040	I give up.
516040	518040	Me?
518040	519040	Me?
539040	542040	You're thinking about going away again, aren't you, Snuffkin?
542040	543040	Hmm.
544040	548040	I know that you go south every year when winter comes, but I'll still miss you, though,
548040	551040	and I wish you could stay here in Moomin Valley.
551040	553040	I know, Moomin.
561040	562040	Where are they?
563040	564040	How do you find them, I think?
564040	566040	I wonder where they're going.
566040	567040	I don't know.
567040	569040	A deserted island, I expect.
570040	572040	Probably the best place for them.
573040	575040	When are you leaving, Snuffkin?
575040	577040	Oh, I haven't decided yet.
577040	580040	So, you'll be here for a bit longer then.
581040	583040	Do you know where you're going?
583040	584040	No.
584040	586040	It must be fun traveling.
586040	588040	Yes, most of the time.
589040	592040	It's the best way of meeting new people and still being on your own.
592040	598040	I wish we could do that, but even when we hibernate and go to sleep, we're never really alone.
598040	601040	I guess I'd hibernate too if I had to stay up here in Moomin.
601040	603040	During all the freezing winter snows.
609040	612040	Do you think I could go south with Snuffkin, Papa?
617040	620040	Not really, it's the moment way to hibernate.
621040	625040	It's a family custom passed down through the years by our ancestors.
625040	628040	But Papa, I don't want to go to sleep for months on end.
628040	631040	I want to travel south with Snuffkin.
631040	633040	Oh, Moomin.
633040	636040	You promise you'll be back on the first day of spring.
636040	637040	Oh, Mama!
637040	640040	Does that mean I can really go?
640040	642040	I can't wait to tell Snuffkin.
642040	643040	I can, can't I?
643040	647040	Well, if you really want to, I don't suppose we'll stop you.
647040	648040	We'll be Papa.
649040	652040	Now, my parents didn't mind when I traveled around in my youth.
652040	654040	So, yes, all right, Moomin.
654040	656040	Oh, thank you, Papa.
656040	658040	Mama, thank you, Mama.
659040	662040	That's great, but what will Snuffkin say?
669040	671040	Well, it's a good idea.
671040	674040	And I got to say it'd be fun to have you a long Moomin.
674040	677040	So, I can come with you Snuffkin?
677040	678040	No.
678040	679040	What?
679040	682040	I'm sorry, but I've got to go on my own.
682040	684040	Don't be disappointed, Moomin.
684040	686040	I told you I travel alone.
686040	687040	I need to.
687040	690040	After spending the rest of the year here, just as I need to be here,
690040	692040	after spending the winter alone.
692040	695040	And the joy of returning to Moomin Valley is something I wouldn't miss.
695040	697040	Which Snuffkin, I thought.
697040	701040	The time will soon pass, and you'll be asleep through most of it.
701040	703040	You won't notice I'm not here.
703040	705040	I'll see you next spring, Moomin.
705040	708040	I'll be back on the first day as usual.
708040	710040	I promise, as soon as the weather warms.
710040	714040	And when the flowers start to grow, nothing will keep me from Moomin Valley.
733040	736040	Ah, I'm sorry I didn't work out for you, Moomin.
736040	738040	Oh, it's all right.
739040	741040	Oh, come on, Moomin.
741040	743040	You'll have to tie them a bit tighter than that.
747040	750040	It'll be a cold winter, so we'll need lots of wood
750040	752040	to keep us going till spring comes.
752040	753040	I know.
753040	756040	Now you want to stay warm, don't you?
756040	759040	When I grow up, I'll go south on my own, too.
759040	762040	Yes, of course you will.
769040	771040	Ah, ah, ah.
779040	781040	Is Moomin home?
781040	783040	Yes.
783040	784040	How is he?
784040	786040	Is he still down in the dumps?
786040	789040	I'm afraid so, grandma's cheer you up, recipe didn't work.
789040	793040	Ah, I think he's being silly just because Snuffkin's going away.
793040	795040	I suppose he is.
795040	797040	But don't worry, mama.
798040	802040	He won't be miserable much longer, because I've got a surprise for him.
819040	822040	Are you there, Moomin?
822040	824040	A moment, don't cry.
824040	826040	Boys don't cry, I suppose.
826040	827040	Of course they do.
827040	829040	Well, I'm not crying so, there.
829040	832040	All right, but I do think you should get up now.
832040	834040	Oh, and why should I?
834040	836040	I have a surprise for you.
836040	837040	I don't want any surprises.
837040	840040	Come on, I'm going to go and see Snuffkin his workshop.
840040	842040	But you know he won't let us in.
842040	844040	I've tried before.
844040	846040	Oh, yes, he will today.
846040	847040	I promise.
847040	848040	What?
848040	851040	You mean Snorkel shows his flying ship at last?
851040	852040	Yes, he said.
852040	854040	Has he really finished it then?
855040	856040	No, not yet.
856040	858040	There's still a lot of work to do on him.
858040	860040	Then I wonder why he's letting us see it.
860040	862040	He's always refused before.
862040	864040	What's made him change his mind?
864040	866040	But I asked him this time.
866040	868040	I said I wanted to show it to you.
868040	869040	It just needed a woman's touch.
869040	871040	What did you say to him?
871040	873040	First, he said absolutely not.
873040	875040	But when I told him how ill you were in that,
875040	877040	you probably wouldn't be with us much longer.
877040	879040	He gave in and said we could see it.
879040	882040	Just you and me have claimed not that it'll snorke maiden.
882040	883040	Oh, good.
883040	885040	Because sometimes some people are very depressed
885040	886040	and just lying bad.
886040	888040	They've done something bad.
888040	890040	Oh, stop it snorke maiden.
890040	891040	Don't say things like that.
894040	896040	I'm only trying to cheer you up.
896040	898040	So remember, don't tell us all.
898040	900040	No one else must know anything about it.
900040	901040	Okay.
910040	911040	Let's go.
914040	915040	No.
926040	927040	Oh, little Mai.
927040	928040	Little Mai.
928040	929040	Trouble.
929040	930040	Big Trouble.
930040	931040	We must fool her.
931040	932040	Yes, but how?
932040	933040	What can we do?
934040	936040	I know what we'll do.
936040	937040	What?
937040	938040	Quick, Moomin.
938040	940040	You just agree with everything I say snorke maiden.
940040	941040	Oh.
942040	944040	I thought you were in bad Moomin.
944040	946040	No, we're going to see snorke.
946040	947040	Yes.
947040	948040	Really?
948040	949040	Yes, he needs to clear a runway
949040	951040	for when the flying ship is finished.
951040	952040	We're going to help him do it.
952040	953040	That's all.
953040	954040	Yes.
954040	955040	Are you really, Moomin?
955040	956040	You got out of bad to do that.
956040	960040	I'm afraid I find it very strange that snorke is asked to go along
960040	963040	and help him cut down bushes and dig up roots and things.
963040	966040	You might have noticed I'm not a complete fool.
966040	967040	But it's true, little Mai.
967040	968040	Oh, yes.
968040	970040	Well, at least you could have invented a better lie.
970040	974040	You must think I'm pretty stupid to believe a pathetic story like that.
974040	976040	But it's the truth.
976040	978040	And we need your help.
978040	979040	Yeah.
979040	980040	Don't bother, don't bother.
980040	981040	I don't want to hear anymore.
981040	983040	I think it's very sad that you have to pretend.
983040	985040	You're trying to hide something from me
985040	988040	and I'm not interested in what sort of sneaky underhanded thing it is.
988040	989040	But little Mai.
989040	992040	No, but, and anyway, I'm a little too busy at the moment
992040	994040	to take any notice of what's going on.
994040	995040	Goodbye.
995040	998040	Come on.
998040	1001040	Phew, that was close.
1001040	1002040	Yeah.
1010040	1011040	Ha, think, thank you.
1011040	1013040	Keep a secret from me, do they?
1022040	1023040	Are you alone?
1023040	1024040	Of course we are.
1024040	1027040	I promised, didn't I?
1027040	1030040	Come in, then.
1036040	1038040	Wow.
1045040	1047040	It's nearly ready, isn't it?
1047040	1049040	Oh, no, there's a lot more to do.
1049040	1051040	The machine isn't half finished yet.
1051040	1054040	And as you can see, there's a lot to do on the ship itself
1054040	1057040	but I'm getting there slowly.
1057040	1061040	I never thought it would be so fantastic, smork.
1061040	1066040	Well, I suppose you could say the design wasn't a complete failure.
1066040	1069040	I'm quite sure it'll fly beautifully.
1069040	1071040	Oh, thank you.
1071040	1073040	Do you really think it will, woman?
1073040	1075040	I can see it now.
1075040	1078040	High up in the air, dodging in and out of the clouds,
1078040	1080040	way up above the world.
1080040	1083040	Well, I'm glad to see that you're so perceptive and quite right.
1083040	1085040	Oh, how very thoughtful of me.
1085040	1087040	Shouldn't you sit down and rest?
1087040	1089040	Do you know your illness?
1089040	1091040	It doesn't help to get too excited.
1091040	1093040	Ha, I shouldn't worry, smork.
1093040	1095040	There's nothing wrong with him.
1096040	1099040	Oh, little my, how did you get in here?
1099040	1101040	Throw that door.
1101040	1102040	But I always keep it.
1102040	1105040	Oh, oh, oh, no.
1105040	1108040	I must have forgotten to lock it.
1108040	1111040	And it's a bit late to do it now, isn't it?
1111040	1112040	But don't worry.
1112040	1115040	If I wanted to get in, I'd get in locks or no locks.
1115040	1117040	Oh, you lied to us, little my.
1117040	1118040	Of course, but so did you.
1118040	1120040	Telling me that stupid story.
1120040	1122040	Now we're even, right?
1122040	1124040	Now, listen, little my.
1124040	1126040	Don't ever tell anybody what you see over here.
1126040	1128040	All right.
1128040	1133040	This invention contains so many outstanding new features
1133040	1137040	it is difficult to know where to begin.
1137040	1140040	But let me start with the most exciting part
1140040	1143040	of the whole construction.
1147040	1152040	It could go as a dream or rather the concept of a dream
1152040	1157040	thrilling, beautiful, impossible, dangerous.
1168040	1170040	Can you take the ship down, movement?
1170040	1173040	I'd like you to land at that side of the lake.
1173040	1175040	Oh, why do you want to get off?
1175040	1178040	Aren't you having fun flying about up here?
1178040	1180040	I want to be on my own.
1180040	1182040	Oh, please stay here.
1182040	1184040	I'll let you steer.
1184040	1185040	I'll be there.
1185040	1186040	I'll be there.
1186040	1187040	I'll be there.
1187040	1188040	I'll be there.
1188040	1189040	I'll be there.
1189040	1190040	I'll be there.
1190040	1191040	I'll be there.
1191040	1192040	I'll be there.
1192040	1193040	I'll be there.
1193040	1194040	I'll be there.
1194040	1196040	Oh, please stay here.
1196040	1198040	I'll let you steer if you want.
1198040	1200040	No, really, movement, please.
1200040	1202040	Bye now.
1202040	1203040	No!
1207040	1209040	Snuff me!
1214040	1218040	Oh, oh, oh.
1225040	1229040	So long then, movement, my friend.
1229040	1231040	I'll see you again next year.
1231040	1234040	The first day of spring.
1254040	1257040	I'll see you again next year.
1257040	1260040	Bye!
1260040	1263040	Goodbye, then, Snuffkin.
1266040	1268040	Goodbye, then, Snuffkin!
1281040	1283040	Off for the winter, Asian Nafkin?
1283040	1285360	Yes, goodbye, Mr. Hemmielin.
1285360	1287920	We'll be seeing you in the spring.
1287920	1290400	Yes, when the snows are gone.
1296800	1301280	Oh, to be young and follow the sun wherever it goes.
1313840	1317520	And so the snow fell and winter came to Moomin Valley.
1317520	1322160	And in Moomin's heart, Snuffkin and the spring seemed a long, long way away.
1325760	1331760	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
1332720	1339440	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1340400	1343840	They're always happy and always at play.
1343840	1347440	The movements are having fun day after day.
1347440	1351040	The movements.
1351040	1355040	The movements.
1355040	1361440	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
1362240	1369040	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1369840	1373200	They're always happy and always at play.
1373200	1376800	The movements are having fun day after day.
1376800	1380640	The movements.
1380640	1384240	The movements.
1384240	1390240	The movements.
