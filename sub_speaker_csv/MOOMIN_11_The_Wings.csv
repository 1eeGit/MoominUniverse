Oh, police, you must stop him, moment. Did you say that you wanted me to help you with something snort Maiden? Yes, I want you to stop snort jumping off the cell side of the cliff. Oh dear, I never thought he was the type. He says it's a test flight.",134700,134700,"SPEAKER_04"
166000,196000,"Oh. Now what? A test flight, did you say? Snort Maiden, do you mean that he's finally finished building his flying ship? No, only the blueprint. At least I think that's all. He doesn't tell me. Well, that's a start. He built a small model of the flying ship's wings and they don't look strong enough to carry anyone. And now he's going to try them out himself to see if they'll work. And I know they won't. They'll break, you know. Now wait a minute, Snort Maiden.

312000,320000,"Don't make such a fuss, snork maiden. Do you really think it's safe? Of course it is. You don't see birds falling out of the sky, do you?",311800,318000,"SPEAKER_10"
320000,326000,"Well, at least do your test flight just above the ground so that if something happens to go wrong, you'll hurt yourself.",318000,328000,"SPEAKER_06"

544000,548000,"Hmm, that would be perfect for robberies.",540600,547400,"SPEAKER_15"

667000,669000,"Oh, please let me have them.",666200,668300,"SPEAKER_02"
669000,672000,"Well, it's not as simple as that moment.",666200,668300,"SPEAKER_02"
672000,675000,"They need testing before the design is done.",669200,674800,"SPEAKER_02"
675000,678000,"Well, it's not as simple as that moment.",669200,674800,"SPEAKER_02"
678000,681000,"They need testing before the design is complete.",675400,680700,"SPEAKER_10"
681000,685000,"But I could do that snork. I know I could do it. Please let me have them.",681000,681000,"SPEAKER_10"
681000,685000,"But I could do that snork. I know I could do it. Please let me have them.",681000,684800,"SPEAKER_02"
685000,688000,"Well, I suppose I could do with some help.",681000,681000,"SPEAKER_10"
685000,688000,"Well, I suppose I could do with some help.",681000,684800,"SPEAKER_02"
688000,691000,"There's a lot to do, fetching and carrying mostly.",685600,687600,"SPEAKER_10"
691000,694000,"You haven't said if I can have the wings or not yet, snork.",688200,690900,"SPEAKER_10"
694000,696000,"Yes, you can, but on one condition.",691300,694100,"SPEAKER_02"
696000,698000,"Anything.",694400,697300,"SPEAKER_10"
698000,702000,"Well, now the blueprints are finished and the wings are more or less right.",697700,701300,"SPEAKER_10"
702000,708000,"I'll need somewhere to build the ship and somewhere to store all the materials so they'll be dry and at hand.",697700,701300,"SPEAKER_10"
708000,711000,"Yes, you will snork. I can see that.",702100,710700,"SPEAKER_10"
711000,715000,"It doesn't have to be much, just a roof will do or and walls.",711000,723600,"SPEAKER_10"
715000,719000,"So that people can't spy on me and steal my ideas.",711000,723600,"SPEAKER_10"
719000,724000,"I can do the building myself, but I'll need some help and when it's finished, you can have the wings.",711000,723600,"SPEAKER_10"
724000,730000,"Great. I'd love to help you. I'd have done that anyway, but now that I can have the wings, I'll work twice as hard.",723600,732800,"SPEAKER_02"
730000,733000,"You won't regret it, snork. I promise you you won't.",723600,732800,"SPEAKER_02"
733000,736000,"Splendid, woman. That settled them.",733000,735800,"SPEAKER_10"
736000,741000,"Perhaps we can get more help. I'm sure that'll be easy. How about it, snuffkin?",733000,735800,"SPEAKER_10"
741000,743000,"Yes, of course.",736400,740900,"SPEAKER_02"
743000,745000,"Will you help us do sniff?",741600,742600,"SPEAKER_02"
745000,747000,"Yes, but I want something too.",745000,749700,"SPEAKER_03"
747000,750000,"I'll let you borrow the wings.",745000,749700,"SPEAKER_03"
750000,754000,"No, I'm far too heavy. I only break them.",749900,754100,"SPEAKER_03"
754000,758000,"Don't worry, sniff. I'm sure I'll think of something you can have.",749900,754100,"SPEAKER_03"
758000,763000,"Oh, as long as it's something nice. Oh, I do love helping people.",754500,758300,"SPEAKER_10"
763000,767000,"You're all heart-sniff. We know that for sure.",758700,762700,"SPEAKER_03"
770000,775000,"I'm sure you'll need some expert help with the shed, snork.",769400,774500,"SPEAKER_06"
785000,787000,"Surely this must be deep enough, Papa?",784800,787100,"SPEAKER_02"
787000,794000,"Oh, no. Lee Moment's always built for posterity. Besides, I like pouring cement.",784800,787100,"SPEAKER_02"
794000,796000,"Okay, Papa.",789000,794700,"SPEAKER_06"
811000,814000,"I've given your present a lot of fortune, all.",810100,810400,"SPEAKER_10"
814000,815000,"Huh?",811800,819200,"SPEAKER_10"
815000,819000,"And I think I'll give you one of my invaluable books on machinery.",811800,819200,"SPEAKER_10"
819000,822000,"Oh? Don't you want it?",811800,819200,"SPEAKER_10"
822000,826000,"Well, if there was something else, I'm not much of a reader.",821000,822000,"SPEAKER_10"
826000,830000,"What about my invaluable fountain pen?",823200,826200,"SPEAKER_03"
830000,832000,"Invaluable fountain pen?",826700,830100,"SPEAKER_10"
832000,834000,"What about my invaluable...",831500,832000,"SPEAKER_03"
834000,837000,"Do you have anything that's not invaluable, snork?",832500,834700,"SPEAKER_10"
837000,840000,"Well, what about a gold coin?",834300,837100,"SPEAKER_03"
840000,843000,"Well, that sounds great. A real gold coin?",837500,839700,"SPEAKER_10"
843000,846000,"Oh, boy, yes, that's a deal.",840400,846100,"SPEAKER_03"
866000,869000,"You are digging a very deep hole.",861000,861100,"SPEAKER_02"
869000,872000,"Oh, why don't you stop and have some sandwiches?",868900,869200,"SPEAKER_02"
872000,875000,"Should we do that, Papa? Go on.",869600,872200,"SPEAKER_02"
875000,877000,"Yes, I think we can stop now.",874900,876900,"SPEAKER_06"
877000,879000,"Sniff and your brother are in the woods.",876800,878800,"SPEAKER_02"

888000,890000,"Hi, snork maiden.",879400,881200,"SPEAKER_02"
892000,894000,"Oh, no.",888600,890100,"SPEAKER_15"
894000,897000,"Wait a minute. I want to ask you something.",892700,894000,"SPEAKER_15"
897000,898000,"What is it?",894500,901400,"SPEAKER_15"
898000,902000,"Tell me, snork maiden, is it true that your brother gave those wings to a woman?",894500,901400,"SPEAKER_15"
902000,906000,"Yes, it is. He's helping snork to build the shed his payment.",894500,901400,"SPEAKER_15"
906000,911000,"I thought they'd been broken up. They hit that tree very hard.",905700,905800,"SPEAKER_02"
911000,913000,"Well, my brother's repairing them.",906900,906900,"SPEAKER_15"
