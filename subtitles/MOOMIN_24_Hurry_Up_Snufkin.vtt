00:00.000 --> 00:20.560
here they are for one and all the moments are about to come on and sit down here with

00:20.560 --> 00:32.800
me there for you on your TV they are the moments they are the moments so come with me give me your hand

00:32.800 --> 00:41.680
I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there with the

00:41.680 --> 00:59.120
moment there was a moments there was the moments there was the moments

01:11.680 --> 01:41.680
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

01:41.680 --> 01:53.920
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. It's spring again in

01:53.920 --> 02:00.620
Mumen Valley and after their long winter hibernation, everyone is awake and enjoying the sunshine

02:00.620 --> 02:03.500
in the flowers.

02:03.500 --> 02:08.220
Everyone that is except for mumen was in bed with a terrible cold.

02:21.980 --> 02:24.620
Oh dear mumen, that's a nasty cough.

02:24.620 --> 02:27.180
My throat is very sore.

02:27.180 --> 02:28.380
This will help soothe it.

02:28.380 --> 02:30.940
It's one of grandma's best potions.

02:34.780 --> 02:35.500
It's hard.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.940
Never mind, nice tasting medicines don't always work as well.

02:42.300 --> 02:44.540
I wanted to go out, it's spring.

02:44.540 --> 02:47.740
I know dear, but you'd catch pneumonia or something.

02:48.940 --> 02:54.060
Oh mama, does anyone know why snuff can't come back here?

02:54.780 --> 02:59.020
No, perhaps spring came earlier this year and he wasn't ready.

03:03.020 --> 03:07.020
Snuff can not always come back to mumen valley on the very first day of spring,

03:08.220 --> 03:09.100
but not this year.

03:14.220 --> 03:15.260
Snuff kill.

03:15.260 --> 03:24.940
I'm mumen papa, is mumen any better?

03:24.940 --> 03:27.580
No, I'm afraid not, he's still got a nasty cough.

03:27.580 --> 03:29.180
Can I go up and see him?

03:29.180 --> 03:30.940
No, you'd better not, you might catch it.

03:36.060 --> 03:39.020
Papa's right, sniff, and you know how poorly you get when you're ill.

03:39.020 --> 03:40.460
It's best not to take the risk.

03:40.460 --> 03:42.700
I should think he'll be up and about before very long.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.540
Yes, it's better to be safe than sorry.

03:46.540 --> 03:48.860
Woman shouldn't have gone out in the winter, should he mama?

03:50.620 --> 03:52.540
No, but he couldn't go back to sleep.

03:52.540 --> 03:54.780
Snow would have that effect on anyone.

03:55.740 --> 04:00.700
Not you, little Mai was out in the cold with him and look at her, she seems healthy enough.

04:03.260 --> 04:05.020
I'll take these flowers to mumen later.

04:05.820 --> 04:07.820
Little Mai's too small to catch a cold.

04:13.340 --> 04:17.340
This is boring.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.780
I can't believe that mumen's sick.

04:20.780 --> 04:22.780
And Snuff gets not back either.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.740
I sure wonder what's happened to him.

04:25.740 --> 04:29.340
I bet you mumen gets better as soon as Snuff can arrive in mumen valley.

04:29.900 --> 04:32.380
He's never been this late coming back before.

04:33.660 --> 04:35.420
Perhaps he's got fed up with you guys.

04:36.220 --> 04:38.380
Impossible, he's very fond of me.

04:38.380 --> 04:40.460
He's told me so lots of times.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.380
He likes mumen too, of course.

04:43.260 --> 04:45.420
He might have been captured by a highway man.

04:46.940 --> 04:48.300
Let's go and look for him.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.060
The highway man?

04:50.060 --> 04:51.340
First Snuff can silly.

04:51.340 --> 04:53.420
He's got to come back so mumen will get better.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.020
We must find him.

04:55.020 --> 04:56.620
But where do we look Snork Maiden?

04:57.340 --> 04:58.300
In the south.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.340
It's a big place.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.380
He could be anywhere.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.620
Well, I don't care how big it is.

05:02.620 --> 05:03.740
I'm going anyway.

05:03.740 --> 05:05.020
You're being silly.

05:05.020 --> 05:05.900
No, I'm not.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.500
I don't think your brother will like it.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.700
In fact, I know he won't.

05:09.660 --> 05:11.900
Have you gone completely bananas?

05:11.900 --> 05:13.340
No, I haven't.

05:13.340 --> 05:15.340
And you'll just have to make your own muffins.

05:15.340 --> 05:17.340
There's more to food than muffins.

05:17.340 --> 05:19.580
I was speaking figuratively.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.580
Anyway, I'm going to your brother

05:21.580 --> 05:23.980
and nothing you can do or say will stop me.

05:23.980 --> 05:25.580
It's for mumen.

05:25.580 --> 05:27.820
That's a sort of hairbrain scheme

05:27.820 --> 05:29.580
that could only have been dreamed up by you.

05:29.580 --> 05:30.620
What good will it do?

05:30.620 --> 05:32.220
You don't even know where he is.

05:32.220 --> 05:33.100
It is not.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.780
Mumen is pining for Snuffkin.

05:34.780 --> 05:36.460
Rubbish.

05:36.460 --> 05:38.220
Men don't pine for their friends.

05:38.620 --> 05:40.940
If he isn't back yet, then he isn't coming.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.140
And if he isn't going to come,

05:42.140 --> 05:43.980
what's the point of looking for him?

05:43.980 --> 05:45.420
You won't find him anyway.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.380
He will come when he knows that Mumen is sick.

05:50.380 --> 05:52.220
Black males just like a sister.

05:53.180 --> 05:55.900
Something done for love could never be black male.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.060
Oh no, you're not going and that's fine.

05:58.060 --> 06:00.940
Look, why don't you and little Mai go by yourselves?

06:00.940 --> 06:03.340
Oh, well, I didn't really make a definite decision.

06:03.340 --> 06:05.260
I just sort of said that I might come along

06:05.260 --> 06:06.780
that if Snort Maiden isn't going,

06:07.180 --> 06:08.540
there doesn't seem any point.

06:08.540 --> 06:09.580
Does there?

06:09.580 --> 06:12.940
And I'm not going because I think it's stupid and hairbrain too.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.620
Snuffkin will come back soon.

06:14.620 --> 06:15.820
Not Snort Maiden.

06:15.820 --> 06:16.940
What do you say to that?

06:24.940 --> 06:27.020
How is Mumen feeling any better?

06:27.020 --> 06:29.660
He's asleep now, but the cough doesn't seem so bad.

06:29.660 --> 06:31.660
And is temperature still quite high?

06:37.100 --> 06:38.220
Already.

06:56.460 --> 06:58.140
Snort Maiden Moan.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.500
Snort Maiden.

07:06.780 --> 07:10.780
And my pleas to see you, Moomin.

07:10.780 --> 07:12.780
You look like you needed a lift.

07:12.780 --> 07:16.780
This magic cloud must be one of those we got from the Hobgoblins top hat.

07:16.780 --> 07:18.780
That's right. I hid one of them away.

07:18.780 --> 07:21.780
What a good idea, Moomin. You are clever.

07:21.780 --> 07:24.780
Well, it was so much fun to last time, wasn't it?

07:24.780 --> 07:27.780
Hi, Moomin! Hi! Hi!

07:27.780 --> 07:31.780
Oh, look, Snuffkin. I didn't know they were here, too.

07:31.780 --> 07:34.780
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

07:34.780 --> 07:37.780
Snuffkin!

07:37.780 --> 07:40.780
Oh! Oh! Oh!

07:40.780 --> 07:43.780
Moomin!

07:43.780 --> 07:45.780
Snuffkin!

07:45.780 --> 07:47.780
Oh, oh!

07:47.780 --> 07:50.780
Oh! Oh!

07:50.780 --> 07:52.780
Moomin!

07:52.780 --> 07:54.780
Snuffkin!

07:54.780 --> 07:56.780
Oh! Oh!

07:56.780 --> 07:58.780
Oh! Oh!

07:58.780 --> 08:00.780
Oh! Oh!

08:00.780 --> 08:02.780
Oh!

08:02.780 --> 08:04.780
That was just a dream.

08:04.780 --> 08:06.780
Snuffkin!

08:06.780 --> 08:08.780
Oh!

08:12.780 --> 08:14.780
You look blousy, Moomin.

08:14.780 --> 08:18.780
Oh, thanks, stinky. You'd better keep away.

08:18.780 --> 08:21.780
There's no need bugs and things like that. Stay away from me.

08:21.780 --> 08:23.780
They're probably frightened of someone so healthy.

08:23.780 --> 08:26.780
Mama isn't letting anyone in here. It's very dull.

08:26.780 --> 08:28.780
You followed a bed or something? Yes, I did.

08:28.780 --> 08:31.780
I know. You were dreaming, weren't you?

08:31.780 --> 08:33.780
Unfortunately, yes.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.780
I know how you feel.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.780
I have that dream a lot.

08:37.780 --> 08:39.780
Oh.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.780
You stand on a windowsill getting ready to break the glass

08:42.780 --> 08:44.780
and inside there's diamonds.

08:44.780 --> 08:46.780
And then, Moomin, you fall.

08:46.780 --> 08:48.780
It's not the same dream at all, stinky.

08:48.780 --> 08:50.780
Snuffkin hasn't come back yet.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.780
Have you heard anything from him? He's very late.

08:52.780 --> 08:54.780
Ah, Snuffkin.

08:54.780 --> 08:56.780
You know something, don't you?

08:56.780 --> 08:59.780
All I know is that he went away as usual last autumn

08:59.780 --> 09:01.780
and hasn't come back yet.

09:01.780 --> 09:02.780
And then...

09:02.780 --> 09:03.780
Yes, what?

09:03.780 --> 09:05.780
Snork Maiden wanted to go looking for him

09:05.780 --> 09:07.780
because he thinks that if Snuffkin comes back,

09:07.780 --> 09:10.780
he won't be sick anymore, but snork with a letter.

09:10.780 --> 09:13.780
Snork Maiden?

09:15.780 --> 09:17.780
Hey, Snork Maiden!

09:17.780 --> 09:19.780
Snork Maiden!

09:23.780 --> 09:25.780
You're not serious, are you?

09:25.780 --> 09:27.780
I feel perfectly all right.

09:27.780 --> 09:30.780
You look like that's warmed up if you ask me.

09:30.780 --> 09:32.780
Thanks a lot.

09:32.780 --> 09:36.780
Now, stinky, tell me which way does Snuffkin normally travel south?

09:36.780 --> 09:38.780
Hey, are you going looking for him?

09:38.780 --> 09:42.780
Yes, it's not really spring in Moomin Valley if he's not around.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.780
It's just not right somehow.

09:44.780 --> 09:47.780
Okay, you're all as mad as each other.

09:47.780 --> 09:49.780
But you'll help me?

09:49.780 --> 09:51.780
I've got to try and find him, stinky.

09:51.780 --> 09:54.780
Yes, all right, but don't tell your parents I helped you.

09:54.780 --> 09:57.780
Don't worry, I want to say a thing.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.780
Sorry, stinky. Are you okay?

10:15.780 --> 10:17.780
No, I'm fine.

10:18.780 --> 10:22.780
Here's your lunch, Moomin. How are you feeling?

10:22.780 --> 10:24.780
Moomin?

10:24.780 --> 10:27.780
Papa, come here quickly.

10:27.780 --> 10:30.780
Mmm.

10:30.780 --> 10:34.780
Oh, Papa, Moomin's gone. He's not in his bed.

10:34.780 --> 10:37.780
Not in his bed? Are you sure, Mama?

10:37.780 --> 10:42.780
Of course I am. His room is empty and there's no sign of him.

10:42.780 --> 10:44.780
Perhaps he's in one of the other rooms.

10:44.780 --> 10:47.780
Don't worry, Mama, I'll find him.

10:49.780 --> 10:53.780
Yo, Moomin.

10:53.780 --> 10:56.780
Moomin.

10:56.780 --> 10:58.780
Hi, Moomin, Papa.

10:58.780 --> 11:00.780
Oh, little Mai.

11:00.780 --> 11:02.780
What's wrong? You look worried.

11:02.780 --> 11:04.780
A moment's gone up somewhere.

11:04.780 --> 11:07.780
I expect you must have gone to look for Snuffkin.

11:07.780 --> 11:08.780
Snuffkin?

11:08.780 --> 11:11.780
Well, you know how crazy Moomin is about him.

11:11.780 --> 11:13.780
Bit stupid if you ask me.

11:13.780 --> 11:16.780
But he's not well, he's got a fever.

11:16.780 --> 11:26.780
You're sure this is the right way?

11:26.780 --> 11:28.780
Of course I'm sure.

11:28.780 --> 11:31.780
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:31.780 --> 11:35.780
Bye.

11:35.780 --> 11:37.780
Bye.

11:37.780 --> 11:41.780
Bye.

11:41.780 --> 11:45.380
Are you sure this is the right way?

11:45.380 --> 11:47.980
Of course I'm sure. I live in this forest, don't I?

11:47.980 --> 11:49.980
Why don't we miss each other somewhere?

11:49.980 --> 11:52.980
Well, if you think you might, don't go then. It's up to you.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.480
But I've got to...

11:54.980 --> 11:56.680
H-h-h-h-h-h-h!

11:56.680 --> 11:58.180
Mumin!

11:58.180 --> 12:00.280
Oh, snorke me, son!

12:00.280 --> 12:01.280
Uh-huh.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.280
Uh-huh.

12:02.280 --> 12:05.280
Where are you taking him, Stinky? You can see he's not well.

12:05.280 --> 12:09.280
I'm not taking him. He insisted on going. I came to look after him.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.280
Is that really right, Mumin?

12:11.280 --> 12:15.080
Yes, I wanted to find snuffkins, so he'd come back.

12:15.080 --> 12:18.080
Well, I was going to find him for you. Little mind's sniff were coming too,

12:18.080 --> 12:20.280
but they chickened out, so I came on my own.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.280
What did Snorke say about that?

12:22.280 --> 12:23.280
I bet he wasn't happy.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.280
Oh, he made a big fuss, and I just let him.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.280
So you just walked out and came on your own?

12:27.280 --> 12:29.280
Brothers, always think they can tell you what to do.

12:29.280 --> 12:32.280
Well, I just ignored him. Did you tell your parents where you were?

12:32.280 --> 12:34.280
Ah, no.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.280
Did you put him up to this stinky? It's just a sort of thing you do.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.280
No, I did not.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.280
That's true, Snark Maiden.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.280
Well, I don't know how you did it stinky, but I know you,

12:43.280 --> 12:46.280
and I know you're to blame, and I don't think I won't find out.

12:46.280 --> 12:49.280
That's not fair, Snark Maiden. It was nothing to do with me at all.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.280
Oh, you're right, Snark Maiden.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.280
He didn't want to show me the way, but I made him.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.280
I'm taking you home.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.280
Oh, but Snark Maiden, look.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.280
No, buts, you're sick, and you should be in bed,

13:02.280 --> 13:04.280
and your parents must be very worried.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.280
Ah, look.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.280
Moomin!

13:07.280 --> 13:10.280
Oh, it's Papa. It isn't that Snark behind him.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.280
Oh, yes, it is.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.280
Oh, oh, it's time I wasn't here.

13:14.280 --> 13:17.280
I'm glad you hadn't gone too far, Moomin.

13:17.280 --> 13:18.280
I might never have found you.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.280
I'm very sorry, Papa.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.280
Ah!

13:23.280 --> 13:25.280
I have a feeling you're behind this stinky.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.280
Come on quickly, I'll win it.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.280
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

13:28.280 --> 13:30.280
It was Moomin's idea. I swear it was.

13:30.280 --> 13:33.280
It was, Papa. I wanted to find Snark Maiden.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.280
Are you all right, Moomin?

13:36.280 --> 13:38.280
Snark Maiden!

13:39.280 --> 13:42.280
Ah, here we go again.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.280
Snark Maiden, what are you doing here?

13:44.280 --> 13:46.280
I thought I told you not to go on this silly jump.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.280
Well, I didn't say I wouldn't. Did I?

13:49.280 --> 13:51.280
Listen to me, Snark.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.280
Ah, you're looking guilty, stinky.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.280
How did you persuade her to disobey me?

13:55.280 --> 13:57.280
See, I told you.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.280
You stay nice and warm in bed, and I'll mix them

14:05.280 --> 14:07.280
of grandma's potion with honey for you.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.280
You'll have to be better soon,

14:09.280 --> 14:12.280
because I have a feeling snuffkins on his way.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.280
My wish snuffkin would hurry up,

14:19.280 --> 14:21.280
then we could all get back to normal at last.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.280
My sentiment's exactly.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.280
So where is Snuffkin?

14:26.280 --> 14:29.280
Well, he's on his way back to Moomin Valley.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.280
But he's had a very long walk,

14:31.280 --> 14:33.280
and is getting very tired now.

14:46.280 --> 14:49.280
Poor Snuffkin, he's had a terrible cold as well,

14:49.280 --> 14:52.280
and is feeling rather weak.

14:53.280 --> 14:54.280
Hello, I know you don't I?

14:54.280 --> 14:55.280
Oh?

14:55.280 --> 14:57.280
Yes, you're snuffkin.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.280
Oh!

15:35.280 --> 15:38.280
Isn't that water still a little cold for that?

15:46.280 --> 15:48.280
You'd better come by the fire and keep warm,

15:48.280 --> 15:50.280
or you'll catch cold.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.280
This is nice!

16:02.280 --> 16:06.280
Just think, I'll be the one that's set by Snuffkin's fire,

16:06.280 --> 16:09.280
and he told me to keep warm and not catch cold.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.280
Hmm, that's no big thing, little fella.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.280
It's a pretty chilly night out here.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.280
Oh, it is!

16:14.280 --> 16:17.280
I've heard so many stories about you from everybody,

16:17.280 --> 16:19.280
and each year I try to watch as you go past,

16:19.280 --> 16:22.280
but I've never been brave enough to talk to you before.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.280
Stories from everybody.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.280
I don't know if I like that.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.280
In fact, I'm sure I don't.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.280
What's your name, little fella?

16:30.280 --> 16:32.280
Oh, well, I haven't got one.

16:32.280 --> 16:35.280
I'm so small that nobody's ever asked me before.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.280
I've always wanted to have a name, you know?

16:38.280 --> 16:40.280
And it was you who asked me,

16:40.280 --> 16:42.280
and I've actually met you and sat next to it.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.280
You're countifying!

16:43.280 --> 16:44.280
Oh, it's so wonderful!

16:44.280 --> 16:47.280
You don't know how happy it makes me meeting you like this!

16:47.280 --> 16:49.280
Aw, come on, you do go on a bit old, fella.

16:49.280 --> 16:50.280
You just get warm now.

16:50.280 --> 16:51.280
Do you think, Snuffkin?

16:51.280 --> 16:53.280
Oh, I don't know whether I should ask you.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.280
I don't want to offend you.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.280
Oh, well, why not?

16:56.280 --> 16:58.280
Yes, I will.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.280
Perhaps you'd be kind enough to it.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.280
I mean, would it be too much trouble for you

17:02.280 --> 17:05.280
to think of a name for me?

17:05.280 --> 17:06.280
There.

17:06.280 --> 17:10.280
I've said it now.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.280
Well, choosing a name is important.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.280
I'd have to think carefully about that.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.280
But it will be easy for you.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.280
Now, everything!

17:17.280 --> 17:18.280
Now, listen to me.

17:18.280 --> 17:21.280
You can't look up to people too much if you want to be yourself.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.280
It's not right.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.280
But Snuffkin, you're so clever.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.280
You can do anything, anything at all.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.280
I know you can.

17:27.280 --> 17:32.280
I've always wanted to be free like you to do whatever I feel.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.280
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm talking too much.

17:34.280 --> 17:36.280
I want to listen to you too.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.280
All about your travels for a start.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.280
I know you're on your way to the Moon Valley to see all your friends.

17:41.280 --> 17:44.280
The hedgehog told me the Moon stayed out for most of the winter.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.280
Just waiting for you to come back.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.280
Now, isn't that wonderful?

17:48.280 --> 17:49.280
What?

17:49.280 --> 17:51.280
I'd love to have someone that missed me so much

17:51.280 --> 17:53.280
they were miserable until I came back.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.280
You don't know how lucky you are that you're so special.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.280
Well, perhaps I'm not going there.

17:58.280 --> 18:01.280
I might have somewhere else to visit instead.

18:04.280 --> 18:08.280
Oh, moment, I'll be very sad if you don't go back.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.280
Yes, but you've got to have time to be on your own as well.

18:11.280 --> 18:15.280
Of course you have, and I've taken up too much of yours now.

18:15.280 --> 18:17.280
Wait, I think I'll be off.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.280
Okay, thanks.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.280
Goodbye, Snuffkin.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.280
Good night, little fella.

18:26.280 --> 18:31.280
Hey, wait a minute.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.280
What about your name?

18:33.280 --> 18:35.280
You remembered.

18:35.280 --> 18:39.280
Well, what do you think of TD Wu, my friend?

18:39.280 --> 18:41.280
Yes, TD Wu.

18:41.280 --> 18:45.280
It's nice and happy to start with, and then a little sadness.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.280
TD Wu.

18:46.280 --> 18:47.280
дом?

18:47.280 --> 18:48.280
T-T Wu.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.280
T-T Wu.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.280
T-T Wu.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.280
T-T Wu.

18:52.280 --> 18:55.280
T-T Wu.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.280
T-T Wu.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.280
T-T Wu, T-T Wu.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.280
T-T Wu.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.280
T-T Wu.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.280
T-T Wu.

19:06.280 --> 19:08.280
T-T Wu.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.280
T-T Wu.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.280
T-T Wu.

19:11.280 --> 19:16.280
Oh, that's great! It's a wonderful name, Titi Woo!

19:16.280 --> 19:21.280
Titi Woo, I'm glad you like it. It's the first time I've ever given anyone a name.

19:22.280 --> 19:29.280
Yeah! I think I'll be able to house and then I can put up a real name plate that says Titi Woo!

19:29.280 --> 19:32.280
Ah, good idea, Titi Woo. About what I said before.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.280
Huh?

19:33.280 --> 19:39.280
You know, not going back to Moomin Valley? Well, I am. I've missed Moomin and all my friends.

19:40.280 --> 19:47.280
Oh, I didn't take that seriously. You just got upset at something I said. I'm afraid that happens a lot. I guess I talked too much.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.280
Maybe you do.

19:48.280 --> 19:54.280
Oh, I'll be going back to Moomin Valley a bit behind schedule. And this year's spring came along early too.

19:54.280 --> 19:58.280
But I suppose it's better late than never, as they say.

19:58.280 --> 20:02.280
Moomin will be happy. Say hello to everyone from Titi Woo!

20:02.280 --> 20:06.280
I will. And I'll tell them how it came about.

20:06.280 --> 20:11.280
That's where you keep your harmonica, isn't it, Snuffkin? It's really famous, you know?

20:11.280 --> 20:13.280
I didn't realize that.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.280
Do you know? I've never ever heard any music.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.280
Really? What would you like me to play?

20:22.280 --> 20:26.280
Anything. Oh, I know. What about Moomin's favorite?

20:36.280 --> 20:40.280
Oh, that's Snuffkin!

21:07.280 --> 21:08.280
Oh, God!

21:18.280 --> 21:20.280
Don't move!

21:33.280 --> 21:35.280
Snuffkin!

21:36.280 --> 21:38.280
Snuffkin!

21:58.280 --> 22:03.280
Now at last, spring really has come to Moomin Valley.

22:04.280 --> 22:11.280
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.

22:11.280 --> 22:18.280
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

22:18.280 --> 22:22.280
They're always happy and always at play.

22:22.280 --> 22:29.280
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

22:29.280 --> 22:39.280
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.

22:39.280 --> 22:47.280
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

22:47.280 --> 22:51.280
They're always happy and always at play.

22:51.280 --> 22:58.280
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

22:59.280 --> 23:02.280
The Moomin's.

23:02.280 --> 23:08.280
The Moomin's.
