00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Mumen Valley had had no rain for weeks, and finally the river had dried up.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Papa says this weather is a catastrophe, Snuffman.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Oh, not really.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But it is. He says Mumen Valley will turn into a desert if it carries on.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.120
I don't think that will happen, Mum.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.280
Papa can't ever remember it so hot.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.000
Even the river is dried up.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.400
No, that does worry me.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.039
I can't fish anymore.

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:20.439
And all my travels I found that droughts like this are always followed by a real heavy downpour.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:35.000
Well, it's too hot for me anyway.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Oh, it's so hot I can't think.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I can always think of something. Well, well, even the weeds are wilting.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The sea never dries up, does it? Of course not, stupid wherever the fish go! I'm going swimming! Here you are. What's this? Oh, no! Oh, no!

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Oh, no!

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Oh, no!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Oh, no!

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Oh, no!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Oh, no!

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Oh, no!

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Oh, no!

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Oh, no!

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Oh, no!

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Oh, no! Oh, no! I'm going to go to the next one. Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Ah!

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Ah!

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Ah!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Ah!

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Ah!

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Ah!

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Ah!

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Ah!

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Ah!

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Ah! Ah! Oh, that hurt.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
What's this stupid box doing here?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I think it's floated from foreign lands.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
What's it got in it?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Perhaps it's full of priceless jewels.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
No, it wouldn't float so high in the water if it was.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
A tiara packed in wood shavings.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.639
I could use a new product. I'm going to use it for a new one. in it. Perhaps it's full of priceless jewels. No, it wouldn't float so high in the water if it was.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.720
A tiara packed in wood shavings. I could use a new comb too.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.240
What have you found you two? A treasure?

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.560
No, we don't think so. It's not heavy enough.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.399
But you never know, Snork Maiden.

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:20.639
Let's open it and see.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:29.000
Come on, Slay's pushed me a shore.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Perhaps it's gold nuggets in here. Our diamonds are something to eat.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
What is this?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Seeds, maybe.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
What sort of seeds?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Hmm.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Well, at first glance, I'd say they might be tropical plants.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Oh, really? Mr. Hemmier.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
What plants are tropical?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Well, species like banana are mangoes.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.199
Banana? And mangoes? Well, I like banana are mangoes. Banana?

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.560
And mangoes?

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.439
Well, I haven't done a lot of research on tropical plants

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:12.839
so I can't be sure, but they do look like it.

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:13.839
I know, mama.

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:15.480
Why don't we plant them?

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.040
Good idea, woman.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.839
The thing is, we don't have a tropical climate.

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:22.120
I'm afraid they wouldn't grow here at all.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.839
Let's plant them, shall we?

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:27.540
They won't bear any fruit, so don't get too excited.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.939
Oh, well, it seems tropical enough to me, Mr. Hanuman.

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:33.040
At least we can try, can't we?

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.180
I want to see what papaya looks like and ugly fruit.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.420
I want mangoes growing all around my bedroom window.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.720
Let's plant them, shall we?

00:06:43.519 --> 00:07:13.439
I tell you, they're strictly tropical tropical they won't take root at all. It certainly seems that Mama is enjoying herself, Mr. Hamulun.

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:15.439
I don't think it'll be much use.

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:19.240
Well, perhaps not, but it's still worth the fun and trying.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.920
Imagine, Mum and Valley, a tropical jungle.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.519
Huh, huh.

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:25.000
Oh, Mr. Hamulun, do you think these seeds will grow into real fruit trees? Imagine moving valley, a tropical jungle. Huh. Huh.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Oh, Mr. Hamulin, do you think these seeds

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
will grow into real fruit trees?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Hmm, let me see.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
What have you got here, little my?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I could very well be mistaken,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
but I think this one is a mango seed.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Hmm, thanks.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And why do you want to know, little my?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.500
Because I'm only growing fruit.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.500
I want to be sure I'm not planning stupid orchids

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.500
or passion flowers or something.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.500
Ha ha ha!

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.500
Mr. Hemiellin, can you tell me which one of these is banana?

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.500
Yeah, I'm not really too sure, but I think it's this one.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.199
You want to grow an orchid too, Snorkmaiden?

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:08.959
No, I just want to plant a banana tree in a really special place.

00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:10.639
It's Mouin's favorite fruit.

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:20.279
I think she'll be disappointed bananas won't grow here.

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:22.279
This weather doesn't belong here either.

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:24.240
If it gets any hotter, I'll melt.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.920
I can't wait for dusk so it'll cool down a bit.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.920
Hmm.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.080
Isn't it wonderful to go to sleep looking at the stars?

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.159
And it's not so hot anymore.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.000
I'll sleep like a log tonight.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
You always do, don't you, Little Maw?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Well, sleep like an extra heavy log, then.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Snorke, Maiden. Why don't you sleep under that tree with moon men and Little Maw?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.080
Oh, because I can't see the stars from there and it makes me feel romantic looking at them.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.000
But you're going to get very wet if it starts raining in the night.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.519
You're joking, surely, Mama.

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:15.519
Not at all.

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:20.360
But it hasn't rained for ages, and there aren't any clouds or anything.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.360
Just stars.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.559
All the toothpicks fell on the floor, and that's a sure sign of rain.

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:25.000
It's not made in real mind if she gets all wet, Lumen Mama. Just stars! All the toothpicks fell on the floor, and that's a sure sign of rain.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.600
It's not made in my mind if she gets all wet, Lumen mama.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.600
That should be happy!

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.000
Who? Why is that?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.600
Because then she'll know that the special tree will start growing, and that's very important to her.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.600
That's true.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:48.000
Good night, everyone. I hope you sleep well.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Oh, oh, oh. Good night, everybody.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Good night, woman.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Good night. Don't snore.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Oh, it's too hot to sleep. Why don't you sleep outside like the children?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
I think I will.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I'll be back.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I'll be back. Oh, it's too hot to sleep.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Why don't you sleep outside like the children?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I think I will.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
A thunderstorm.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I told you the toothpicks are never wrong.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Oh!

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Hey, it's raining, movement!

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Wake up, movement!

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Oh, is it morning?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
The sun's really bright.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
No, it's raining.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Rainy?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Look at that.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
You look, I'm getting wet, I'm going inside.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So mama was right about the rain.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Hey, snork, Maiden!

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Hmm?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Doesn't she look sweet?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Snork, Maiden!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Is it raining?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.399
That's very clever. Your mother knows everything doesn't she?

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:28.200
She does.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.799
Now let's get into the house.

00:11:29.799 --> 00:11:30.799
Not yet.

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:33.000
I want to feel the rain on my face.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.600
It's been so long.

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:39.299
Ha!

00:11:39.299 --> 00:12:36.000
You want to feel it much longer? It's going to go. Oh, it's the breathing.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Huh? Oh.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Mangoes! That's impossible!

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Gosh!

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
By my tail, a jungle! That's a tropical jungle!

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Wake up! Wake up you two! There's a jungle outside! We've planted a jungle!

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
A jungle?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.700
You're right, Moments! Those seeds have not only sprouted. I know. They're big trees.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.000
I've never known trees to grow like that.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.299
That's... that's...

00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:31.299
I think I'll go and play Tarzan.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I wish my lettuce seeds would do that, Moments Papa.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.500
Oh, there's magic here somewhere, Moments. Let's go and explore.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
That's rain drumming on the campus.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000
It must be.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Snuffkin!

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
What a nurse all this?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.879
Well, we found a crate of tropical seeds and planted them last night.

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:08.639
And this morning, while you can see it's like magic.

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:10.120
It's fantastic.

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:12.799
I know. We can go on a safari.

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:19.840
I've seen nothing like it.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.320
What kind of flower is this?

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.639
It looks like an orchid to me.

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:29.919
This is a real tropical jungle isn't it, Snuffkin?

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:30.919
Not quite.

00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:31.919
What do you mean?

00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:35.320
Well, Moomin, a real jungle would have wild animals in it, wouldn't it?

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.240
Oh yeah, like tigers and snakes.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:51.000
This is more of a tropical botanical garden I suppose.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
That's a woman's little mind. He can have the peel.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
This is a life.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Stop, little mind.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Now where? Stop, little mind! Well, well...

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
What are you looking for, dear? My solar toady.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
You what?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
My son helmet, I can't go into the jungle without it.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
I didn't know you had one.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
I used it for a fancy dress party once, I know.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
I put it in a box somewhere.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Oh, here it is.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Very dashing, dear. I thought so too. once, I know I put it in a box somewhere. Oh, here it is.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Very dashing deer.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I thought so too.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Oh, I know.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Oh!

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Oh!

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Oh!

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Oh!

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Oh!

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Oh!

00:15:44.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Oh! Oh! Oh, splendid protection this hat. to get into the cello. What for? To get my gun.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Your gun?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Only fools venture into the jungle without a proper gun.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I don't think you need a gun, Papa.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And why not?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Because there aren't any wild animals.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Well, one of the seas might have been an egg or something.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Look at these, for instance, they look very animal.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Very odd animals. More than odd plant, I think. I'd stay away from them. They could be very dangerous.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
But they've got eyes.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Careful. I think they're man-eating plants.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Man-eating.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Stop that.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Help! Help!

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.519
They're trying to eat me.

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:50.000
But they want to feed me to their young.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, help me!

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Oh, help!

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:05.000
They're tearing my toe! Oh no! Oh dear! Oh oh! Oh oh! Oh! Oh!

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Help!

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Oh! Oh no!

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Oh oh!

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Oh oh!

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Oh oh!

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Well done my little Maya, just saved my life!

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Well I saved your tail anyway! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, That should keep them in now, shouldn't it?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Well, I don't think they could push their way through that lot.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Hmm, they had a very strong grip on my tail.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
He mustn't underestimate them.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Anything wrong?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
You bet the sellers fall of man-eating plants,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
trying to gobble up moment-papa!

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Oh!

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Oh, my goodness!

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! You mustn't underestimate them. Anything wrong? You bet the seller's full of man-eating plants

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Oh!

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Oh my goodness!

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
What's the matter?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
You can get straight from the seller into the kitchen.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
What?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Oh no, mama! Oh, hello. Cue, we got here just in time. Whatever's the matter with you, are you all playing Tarzan?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Oh, no, mama.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
I'm making grandmas if you ever get a tropical fruit recipe.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
And perhaps now it's rained I can wash this dirty floor.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Ah, I'm going to have a drink.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
I'm going to have a drink.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
I'm going to have a drink.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
I'm going to have a drink. I'm going to have a drink. making grandmas if you ever get a tropical fruit recipe and perhaps now it's reigned I can wash this dirty floor.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Ah, by the great bumble I don't believe this a tropical rainforest.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Ah, ah, a transcendentia, megaloids.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000
And yes, at this Pepsi of Florium Wonder! Goodness me, I can collect a whole tropical

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Hermoreum right here in Mum and Valley!

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
I'd try, well, that's what I need. I'll get one from the Moomins!

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Must say they're not the tiniest family.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
I'll have to move this.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Oh, this old furniture.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Yeah.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Yeah.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Uh.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Do I look that funny?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
No, you look great!

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Maybe you and Tarzan have different muscles.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Me, Tarzan!

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
You, Jay.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Oh, here we go.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Me, get out with Ormysick!

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Ah!

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Ah, help!

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
I've got many things planned after this!

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.960
What? They must have got out! Uh-huh.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.960
Ow!

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.200
Uh-oh!

00:20:19.599 --> 00:20:21.359
They were in the cellar.

00:20:21.359 --> 00:20:23.599
Did you open the door, Mr. Hamillet?

00:20:23.599 --> 00:20:27.000
Well, yes, I wanted to borrow a trowel. Mr. Hemmielin. Mr. Hemmielin, you know all about plants. Do you have any idea how we can get rid of them?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
They're man-eaters, you know?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Can't rid of them.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Well, let's see.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
We are in a bit of a fix.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
I have heard that they have reacted to music.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Music.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Snowfkin, you could play your harmonica.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Hmm.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Hmm.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.839
I'm not sure if I can play it. I'm not sure if I can play it. the day of reacting music music. Snuffkin, you could play your harmonica.

00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:07.000
Look, they've started dancing. Keep it up, snuffkin!

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
What will they do if he stops playing?

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
I really don't know.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
I don't know.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
I don't know.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I don't know.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000
I don't know.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
What's this? Oh!

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
The rather sweet when they don't try to eat you.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
I'm not going to eat you.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
I'm not going to eat you.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I'm not going to eat you.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:52.079
I'm not going to eat you. I'm not going to eat you. I don't try to eat you.

00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:55.000
And that was how a tropical jungle grew and surrounded

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.440
movement house in one night.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.039
Is it going to stay?

00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:00.799
And for how long?

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:27.099
And what will the man eating plants do if Snuffton stops playing? The movements. They're always happy and always at play.

00:22:27.099 --> 00:22:30.599
The movements are having fun day after day.

00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:34.299
The movements.

00:22:34.299 --> 00:22:38.299
The movements.

00:22:38.299 --> 00:22:41.700
