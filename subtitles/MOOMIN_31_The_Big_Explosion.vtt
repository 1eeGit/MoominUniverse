WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.620
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with

00:20.620 --> 00:30.460
me here for you on your TV they are the movements they are the movements so come

00:30.460 --> 00:37.260
with me give me your hand I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just

00:37.260 --> 00:44.660
like a bird sing that song ever there were the movements there were the

00:44.660 --> 00:59.380
movements there were the movements there were the movements

00:59.380 --> 01:15.180
one night movement was having a dream what a wonderful feeling to be flying like this

01:15.180 --> 01:21.700
look over there movement what a beautiful lake this is one of the most fantastic

01:21.700 --> 01:26.580
experiences I've ever had me too I never knew birds had such a marvelous life

01:26.580 --> 01:33.780
seeing things from a completely different point of view we're flying pretty high aren't we

01:33.780 --> 01:44.220
I'm scared we're much too high let's go down please let's go down at once I'm not scared of heights

01:44.220 --> 01:53.180
oh snorke this time you really have succeeded will I could build hundreds of these if you wanted me to

01:53.180 --> 02:03.260
snorke can I steer just for a little while oh thank you do you really know how to steer

02:03.260 --> 02:24.100
this is okay really it's just a dream

02:33.260 --> 02:50.540
oh gosh my head hurt so what a strange dream why would my brother let stinky

02:50.540 --> 02:57.140
steer his flying ship surely not I was talking to snorke while I looked away

02:57.140 --> 03:03.380
suddenly stinky took his place oh and then the thing began tilting hmm but it was just a dream

03:03.380 --> 03:08.860
I don't care I don't like it you shouldn't have dreams like that just for my brother's flying ship is

03:08.860 --> 03:14.500
almost ready dreams often come true you know but it was nothing like the ship your brother's

03:14.500 --> 03:20.580
building it was totally different but tell me what happened to it in the end did it fall down I

03:20.580 --> 03:25.780
don't know I lost sight of it when I fell off and I didn't see it again well surely you could have

03:25.780 --> 03:32.660
turned your head to take a look well I didn't listen moment don't say a word to the snorke

03:32.660 --> 03:39.060
about this he's nervous enough as it is of course not why don't we just forget about it pretend it

03:39.060 --> 03:48.660
never happened oh snorke it's finally completed sure it is but it hasn't been flown yet of course

03:48.660 --> 03:53.940
but it will I want it snorke you don't think there's anything wrong with it of course not but it's

03:53.940 --> 04:02.980
just there's some problem snorke well there might be so what is it fuel fuel but you said you

04:02.980 --> 04:09.620
had developed a new fuel that was really good it's good but you see you see it might not be

04:09.620 --> 04:17.140
powerful enough you mean it might be able to fly no it won't you're quite right or it will

04:17.140 --> 04:23.220
just be an ordinary ship not a flying ship oh that would be nice what can't go up can't possibly

04:24.100 --> 04:29.140
but that's not the point if it won't fly everyone will laugh at me I know they will

04:30.500 --> 04:36.900
I won't laugh I promise maybe not others will but you wouldn't care about that would you

04:36.900 --> 04:42.020
who cares what other people think the thing is I've already told people that the test flight

04:42.020 --> 04:48.740
will be quite soon in public but I'm sure people will be very nice about it even if it doesn't get

04:48.740 --> 04:56.420
off the ground that's hardly what I want moving I'd like to ask you a favor that's why I sent

04:56.420 --> 05:02.420
for you will you help me I'll do anything you ask snorke of course what I would like is for you

05:02.420 --> 05:13.060
moving my friend to be test pilot for me tomorrow you want me to be a pilot

05:33.220 --> 05:42.660
hey stinky stinky oh listen stinky I'm going to steer that ship is that perfectly clear

05:43.460 --> 05:46.260
you're not to touch the wheel I'm the pilot now

05:52.820 --> 06:00.660
what on earth was that a bear wouldn't you find it difficult to steer it oh no it's real easy

06:00.660 --> 06:05.700
but of course I need to practice before the public demonstration is the snorke going to fly

06:05.700 --> 06:11.700
his own ship he'll be there but he has to stay down in the engine room snuff can I wonder if

06:11.700 --> 06:20.420
this ship will really fly the only problem is the fuel only the fuel you say that's a big problem

06:20.420 --> 06:28.260
I suppose so listen woman suppose now the snorke's flying ship really gets off the ground well of

06:28.260 --> 06:32.740
course it's going to papa that something could happen something could break or you could fall

06:32.740 --> 06:40.100
into an air pocket it's such a dangerous undertaking think moment papa now listen it's not natural

06:40.100 --> 06:46.340
for moments to fly about up in the air is it snuff can quite right well would you and the snorke

06:46.340 --> 06:52.900
do if things went wrong we will be wearing parachutes you know parachutes you don't know what they

06:52.900 --> 07:01.380
are don't you papa of course I do they come down from the sky like this exactly but of course

07:01.380 --> 07:08.660
we won't need a parachute because nothing will go wrong and I will be the first flying ship pilot ever

07:10.020 --> 07:20.580
oh hi there hello my young man hello how do you do how do you do everybody hello sir I wonder if

07:20.580 --> 07:27.300
you can help me do you happen to know where the snorke's factory is you mean the ship I must

07:27.300 --> 07:33.780
see him I'm most eager to have a look at his famous flying ship how do you know about that it's

07:33.780 --> 07:40.260
supposed to be very secret the information must have leaked out somehow oh well all inventors know

07:40.260 --> 07:47.620
about what he is trying to do he's famous throughout moving valley this snorke really are you an

07:47.620 --> 07:54.900
inventor too indeed I am one of the more famous I think maybe the most famous of them all I am

07:54.900 --> 08:02.740
moment papa how do you do sir I'm snuff can and my name is moment please to meet you a very good

08:02.740 --> 08:14.900
day to you one and all the muffles my name I said I'm the muffled you mean you've never even heard

08:14.900 --> 08:22.420
of me the most famous inventor oh yes I'm sure I am the muffled isn't it yes it is the muffled have

08:22.420 --> 08:28.740
you invented anything exciting muffled mr. muffled I it would be much easier to tell you what I

08:28.740 --> 08:34.740
haven't invented young man for instance the pin that can't prick because it has two heads the

08:34.740 --> 08:40.420
newspaper that reads itself the purse that moans and groans if you take money from it the adhesive

08:40.420 --> 08:45.780
tape that sticks only to itself this is perhaps the greatest of all my latest inventions

08:47.140 --> 08:53.220
whatever is that this is proper self a man powered fan infanible in muddy weather

08:53.380 --> 09:13.220
all these are my latest inventions you didn't know that did you know we didn't but try and give

09:13.220 --> 09:19.620
a handkerchief the square balloon the five wheel car the hexagonal frying pan the seven hole

09:19.620 --> 09:25.780
button and a host of others indeed how interesting here what did you want to see the snorke

09:25.780 --> 09:31.540
about I thought I might be able to help him out with one of my inventions that's what oh dear

09:31.540 --> 09:40.420
which one my new no it's very top secret stuff I can tell you now where is the snorke's factory I'll

09:40.420 --> 09:48.020
take you right there very kind of you come he'll be so surprised must be off see you again it's a

09:48.020 --> 09:54.980
pleasure to help these budding inventors snorkel be so excited famous inventor what is your

09:54.980 --> 10:01.380
opinion snuffkin have you ever seen a triangular handkerchief movement papa no when I don't want to

10:01.380 --> 10:08.100
either I do wonder what he's cooked up for the snorke though it is sort of intriguing yes indeed

10:08.100 --> 10:13.380
women will be able to tell us later I suppose yes but anything could happen before then can we

10:13.380 --> 10:27.700
wait that long snuffkin you're right no wait for me I'm coming with you oh I thought we had

10:27.700 --> 10:31.300
several guests we're in the world if they all gone

10:48.260 --> 10:50.500
now where are they off to I wonder

10:57.780 --> 11:08.420
oh look who's coming what are you doing here we're just interested

11:10.180 --> 11:16.020
where are the muffle and the snorke the snorke and the muffle are discussing some top secret project

11:16.020 --> 11:22.900
it's very harsh not a triangular handkerchief I hope I don't know papa as I said it's top secret

11:23.060 --> 11:31.300
hmm let's see oh bother the curtains in the way so I can't see a thing

11:34.820 --> 11:40.420
so this is the powerful fuel you've developed is it mr muffle yes it is not as original as

11:40.420 --> 11:47.380
my other inventions I admit but very useful yes useful I call it super fuel only trouble is my

11:47.380 --> 11:53.540
engine has been designed for liquid fuel no problem at all young man if you dissolve this

11:53.540 --> 12:00.740
block of fuel in 10 liters of water your engine will run for at least 10 hours for 10 whole hours

12:00.740 --> 12:05.780
that's incredible if you doubt the word of the muffle then try it out and see for yourself

12:05.780 --> 12:12.660
right now right now better still I guarantee that if used as it is in a solid state your engine

12:12.660 --> 12:19.300
will run not for 10 but for 100 hours 100 hours but that's incredible you really must be some

12:19.300 --> 12:27.380
inventor indeed if what you say is true it would solve the last problem of my flying ship oh now

12:27.380 --> 12:33.700
that I've looked more closely at the padlock this store isn't locked no it isn't so if one

12:33.700 --> 12:38.660
wanted to see the snorke one could work right here but why would you want to see him papa well

12:39.460 --> 12:46.500
why don't you tell us I don't want snorke falling for one of the muffles crazy ideas that's why

12:46.500 --> 12:51.940
well we'll find out pretty soon maybe you don't realize it but the snorke is pretty clever you know

12:53.140 --> 12:57.140
I think I know exactly what they're doing in there yeah what

12:59.540 --> 13:04.420
I saw that man pouring something into the flying ship what was it well I guess it must have

13:04.420 --> 13:09.620
been fuel movement how come you saw him there's a crack that's just about wide enough for me

13:09.620 --> 13:15.860
but I won't tell you where what are those two in there talking about oh yeah so this is the great

13:15.860 --> 13:22.180
super fuel wait a minute snorke there must be something wrong with it yeah you are

13:22.180 --> 13:29.060
fair you are solid fuel indeed huh a hundred hours you're an imposter sir oh it isn't true if

13:29.060 --> 13:34.740
you just let me explain no thank you I know very well why you came over here with that ridiculous

13:34.740 --> 13:41.140
story off with you right now listen to me it is not ridiculous and it is not just a story

13:42.340 --> 13:47.540
maybe we shouldn't have dissolved it in the water that was a mistake imposter but I'm the

13:47.540 --> 13:53.140
mother I don't care maybe it's just a misunderstanding and the fuel isn't suited for flying ships

13:53.140 --> 13:58.500
wrong it suits everything forget the fuel that was just a trick so he could come here and get

13:58.500 --> 14:05.620
to see my flying ship so the muffler has come here to spy mean ridiculous I don't steal

14:05.620 --> 14:14.660
papa was there anything you wanted to see me about huh no I just dropped by no cause for excitement

14:14.660 --> 14:19.780
the fuels are done no it's not that's not true I don't invent guns what would be the point of

14:19.780 --> 14:25.460
inventing them oh listen to me please let's try and use the fuel once more small thanks once

14:25.460 --> 14:30.100
was once too many I'll have to clean my tanks from your gunge get out of my sight

14:40.740 --> 14:44.900
oh dear this must have been a bit of a disappointment for the snorke I know

14:44.900 --> 14:59.620
now listen stinky I'm doing this for the snorke say isn't that so I don't care

14:59.620 --> 15:03.940
you're doing it for all I want is to get a good look at the famous flying ship you'd need

15:03.940 --> 15:08.740
something very powerful to get a thing like that off the ground something so powerful that only

15:08.740 --> 15:13.540
I the muffler could ever have invented it remind me one day to show you my famous triangular

15:13.540 --> 15:19.780
handkerchief now all we have to do is not dissolve the fuel in water but use the solid fuel hurry

15:19.780 --> 15:26.100
up with that lock sticky or maybe I should invent a lock pick come on stinky hurry hurry

15:28.340 --> 15:33.300
there you're done good come we don't have much time no I'm dying to steer this ship

15:33.460 --> 15:35.300
oh

15:36.260 --> 15:39.860
me up take it up to 2,000 meters yeah

15:42.500 --> 15:47.140
oh stinky stinky we're flying at a height of just over 2,000 meters now

15:47.140 --> 15:52.580
stinky yeah I'm listening what is it when you hear me say now that's when I want you to start

15:52.580 --> 15:58.580
up the engine immediately all right no problem I guess it must be this one no no not yet

15:58.580 --> 16:05.780
this is it just a drop of water on the fuel block now that should do it can I start it now

16:06.340 --> 16:08.100
not yet all right

16:12.420 --> 16:15.780
now start up the interesting key my answer

16:18.900 --> 16:25.300
did you really turn on the switch yes I did the engine won't start are you quite sure you turn

16:25.300 --> 16:31.460
the one I pointed out to you I think so maybe I turned the wrong one there outside these two

16:31.460 --> 16:36.500
as well come on stinky this is no joke my reputation as a famous inventor is at stake

16:37.860 --> 16:43.300
this should do it I think is that work Mr. Mapple nothing is happening I do I shouldn't

16:43.300 --> 16:49.140
have let you do it better to do it myself you're useless wait Mr. Mapple I haven't tried the very

16:49.140 --> 16:54.260
last one in the row this one switch left what I better throw that one too you never know it might

16:54.260 --> 16:56.260
just do the trick

17:19.540 --> 17:23.700
I'm not surprised but I'm so pleased with myself

17:24.260 --> 17:31.060
you should be here snort this is my great moment and you should be here to share it with me come on

17:31.060 --> 17:32.820
I can't wait to try this thing

17:36.980 --> 17:44.020
incredible this ship to rise like a Phoenix not the most imagine this is one of my desert inventions

17:54.340 --> 17:56.340
wait

18:05.540 --> 18:08.420
come on let me go come on

18:12.900 --> 18:16.100
sheer power I don't think it is starting out

18:16.740 --> 18:18.660
I very much afraid it's exploding

18:19.540 --> 18:23.060
whoa hey stinky religions exploding

18:23.060 --> 18:28.180
where it gets the back to find out about this ship it's going to explode any minute by wonderful

18:28.180 --> 18:31.220
fantastic

18:42.260 --> 18:44.260
oh

18:58.180 --> 19:13.900
Now come to your nice room on the small side, but the very best one.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.300
That explosion...

19:15.300 --> 19:18.780
It really was most unexpected, officer.

19:18.780 --> 19:20.340
Everybody knows you're a great inventor.

19:20.340 --> 19:22.820
I wonder if you could help me, Mr. Muffel.

19:22.820 --> 19:23.820
But how?

19:23.820 --> 19:27.740
Could you think of something to protect my roses while you're staying with us?

19:27.740 --> 19:29.340
A non-explosive, of course.

19:29.340 --> 19:30.500
Of course I could.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.140
Piece of cake, officer.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.740
Oh, I really did want to fly.

19:39.180 --> 19:42.300
Come, come now, cheer up, snorke dear.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.980
Here you are, a nice cup of tea.

19:44.980 --> 19:45.980
Thanks.

19:48.580 --> 19:52.420
It's very strange, but I had a dream the other night about a flying ship.

19:52.420 --> 19:54.020
Did you really move in?

19:54.020 --> 19:56.220
That sounds very interesting.

19:56.220 --> 19:57.900
Yes, very interesting.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.700
Moment, tell me about it.

19:59.700 --> 20:05.780
Yes, it was a peculiar looking ship, totally different from your flying ship, snorke.

20:05.780 --> 20:07.220
Different, huh?

20:07.220 --> 20:12.460
Well, it was sort of round like this.

20:12.460 --> 20:16.260
It had a propeller and something hanging underneath.

20:16.260 --> 20:19.380
And we flew over a high mountain.

20:19.380 --> 20:20.620
Round?

20:20.620 --> 20:21.540
Yes.

20:21.540 --> 20:24.380
And you were in a sort of thing hanging underneath?

20:24.380 --> 20:25.180
Yes.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.620
Round?

20:26.620 --> 20:30.220
Round, huh?

20:30.220 --> 20:33.580
Round?

20:33.580 --> 20:35.700
What ever is the matter, snorke?

20:35.700 --> 20:36.980
What?

20:36.980 --> 20:39.180
Oh, mama, thanks for the tea.

20:39.180 --> 20:41.140
I think I'm getting a new idea.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.780
Moment, see you later.

20:42.780 --> 20:45.380
Papa, I must go.

20:45.380 --> 20:47.020
Oh, there he goes again.

20:47.020 --> 20:48.300
I know that, look, mama.

20:48.300 --> 20:53.020
You won't get an intelligent answer out of him for the next month or so, honestly.

20:53.020 --> 20:55.020
I'm very happy for him.

20:55.020 --> 20:58.940
I must say that was a very clever dream you had, Moment.

20:58.940 --> 21:01.420
I'm a better inventor than the model.

21:01.420 --> 21:06.580
Unusual triangular acruchy.

21:06.580 --> 21:09.940
So the explosion didn't distress the snort for long.

21:09.940 --> 21:15.260
Soon he was back at his favorite occupation, planning, but planning what?

21:15.260 --> 21:16.260
Rome.

21:16.260 --> 21:17.260
Yeah.

21:17.260 --> 21:18.260
Rome.

21:18.260 --> 21:19.260
Yeah.

21:19.260 --> 21:20.260
Rome.

21:20.260 --> 21:42.260
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements, believing in sharing and

21:42.260 --> 21:47.260
giving the movements.

21:47.260 --> 21:51.260
They're always happy and goes at play.

21:51.260 --> 21:54.260
The movements are having fun day after day.
