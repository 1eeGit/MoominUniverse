118880	120880	Mama! Mama!
120880	122880	Are they ready?
122880	123880	Are what ready?
123880	124880	The pancakes!
124880	125880	Not yet.
125880	127880	This hobgoblin wood doesn't seem to burn very well.
127880	129880	Aren't they cooking?
129880	130880	They won't be long.
130880	131880	Have some lemonade while you're waiting.
131880	132880	Mama!
132880	134880	Are the pancakes ready yet?
134880	135880	Oh well.
135880	137880	Everything seems normal in the movement house.
137880	138880	Oh!
140880	141880	I'm a dumbo.
141880	143880	I'm a no-good, mean, good-boot, Ninny.
143880	145880	No, you're not, Snork.
145880	146880	You're very clever.
146880	150880	I'm a failure of flop of frightful fraud and a misfit.
150880	152880	But your landship was a success?
152880	154880	Wasn't it?
154880	155880	Kid stuff!
155880	158880	Look, if you can make a ship that runs on land,
158880	160880	then I'm sure you can make one that flies.
160880	162880	I believe in you.
162880	166880	Fatal out of good, that does me snort and maiden.
166880	169880	You know, last night, I thought,
169880	173880	I've done it, a flagship, then I looked at it again.
174880	175880	No good, no good.
175880	176880	It was all wrong.
176880	178880	Wouldn't, couldn't fly at all.
178880	182880	Oh, how can someone so intelligent be such an idiot?
182880	184880	Oh dear, oh dear.
187880	188880	Well, they're ready.
188880	190880	Go and tell the others, little Mai.
190880	192880	All right, move in, Mama.
192880	194880	Where's Moomin and Snork Maiden?
194880	196880	Snork Maiden's fallen again.
198880	200880	Come on, Snork Maiden, cheer up.
200880	202880	I'm sure Snork will get over it.
202880	205880	Inventors always feel down in the dumps when something doesn't work.
205880	207880	Does Moomin, Papa, do you think?
207880	210880	He invents stories, doesn't he, Moomin?
210880	212880	Well, where Moomin was, really?
213880	215880	Snork Maiden, do you want some pancakes?
215880	217880	Oh, yes, please, Moomin, Mama.
217880	219880	Moomin, go and get Papa.
219880	222880	I have a feeling he's writing his gut stuck again.
222880	223880	Okay, Mama.
225880	227880	Now, what's the matter, Snork Maiden?
228880	229880	Hmm.
231880	234880	Well, the sun returned to the eastern sky when morning came
234880	236880	and everything started to get lighter and louder.
236880	238880	Oh dear, everybody knows that.
238880	241880	Even the stupidest retard of Rayleigh.
242880	245880	I have absolutely no literary talent.
245880	249880	I'm an ignoramus son, a literate dilatant, nor an illiterate idiot.
249880	252880	It's high time I gave up writing, though.
253880	254880	Yes?
255880	256880	Papa?
256880	258880	Yeah, what is it, Moomin?
259880	262880	Uh, Mama said to tell you the pancakes are ready.
262880	265880	Well, I can't stop now, I'm being creative.
265880	266880	I'll eat later.
266880	267880	Oh, really?
268880	269880	Yes, anything else?
270880	273880	Yeah, no, I thought you said something.
281880	283880	Moomin, wait, I'm coming.
287880	290880	That was really good, Moomin, Mama.
290880	291880	I'm going out.
291880	292880	I'm coming!
293880	294880	No, you can't.
294880	298880	Snuffkin and I are going on an adventure and it could be dangerous.
303880	305880	Hi, Snuffkin!
305880	306880	Hello, Moomin.
306880	307880	Didn't think you were coming.
307880	308880	Sorry, I'm late.
308880	309880	What's that?
309880	310880	A leaf boat.
310880	313880	Look, it sails on the river just like a real one.
313880	316880	I bet it goes all the way down to the sea.
316880	318880	And maybe even to some foreign lands.
318880	321880	Gosh, Snuffkin, I'd like to do that one day.
321880	323880	Let's go then, shall we?
323880	327880	Little Mai wanted to come, but I told her it was too dangerous.
327880	330880	Hmm, perhaps that wasn't the best thing to say.
330880	331880	Look!
331880	332880	Where are you?
332880	333880	Where are you?
333880	335880	I brought these to you, Moomin.
335880	337880	I thought they could use a bit of fun.
337880	338880	I'm going out.
338880	339880	Wait, where are you?
339880	341880	I brought these to you, Moomin.
341880	343880	I thought they could use a bit of fun.
343880	344880	Wait, Moomin!
350880	353880	Are we really going to climb up there?
353880	355880	Look, I don't think we can all go.
355880	357880	It'll just be Moomin and me.
357880	359880	I'm not climbing up there.
359880	360880	Well, I am.
360880	363880	Wouldn't you like to keep me company instead?
363880	366880	Look, there's a cave just a little bit further along this path.
366880	368880	Why don't you two girls wait for us there?
368880	369880	We won't be long.
369880	373880	But if you can walk to it, why on earth climb to it?
373880	375880	Ah, difficult for a girl to understand.
375880	378880	Well, I think boys are difficult to understand.
378880	380880	We're not sure we can reach it from above.
380880	382880	Well, we'll soon find out.
382880	384880	Are you coming with us, Snuff?
384880	386880	Oh, I think I'll guard the rear.
386880	388880	Protect the cave from below.
388880	391880	Oh, yeah.
391880	394880	Well, someone has to look after the girls.
394880	396880	Someone responsible.
415880	417880	Oh, my goodness, it's dark in there.
417880	419880	Let's go in, then.
419880	421880	I don't like the look of it.
421880	423880	We'd better stay out here.
423880	425880	I never know who might live in there.
425880	426880	Don't be silly.
426880	427880	No one lives in there.
427880	429880	That's what I don't like.
429880	432880	Yes, exactly a place with no one living in it is really scary.
436880	439880	I think we must be right above the cave here.
439880	440880	Maybe.
440880	442880	I can't find the hole, though.
442880	445880	Let's look a bit more over that way, moving.
447880	451880	Wow, I've never seen a shell like this before.
451880	453880	Oh, look at that one.
453880	455880	They must be worth a fortune.
455880	457880	Come over here and look, little mind.
459880	461880	Where's little mind, Snork Maiden?
461880	463880	She went into the cave, Snuff.
463880	465880	Oh, no, she can't do that.
465880	467880	It might be dangerous.
469880	473880	Little mind, little mind, come out.
473880	475880	No, you come in, scaredy cat.
475880	477880	You can't just go in like that.
477880	478880	You can't.
478880	481880	So tell me, how would you go in there and Mr. Knove at all?
481880	483880	Stay where you are.
483880	485880	We'll rescue you.
485880	488880	You're coming, too, aren't you, Snork Maiden?
488880	490880	You can't stay here alone.
490880	492880	I suppose so.
492880	494880	Right then, let's go.
494880	498880	Shall I hold your hand in case you get frightened?
498880	502880	Little mind, where are you?
505880	506880	Stop it, please.
506880	508880	You're frightening Snork Maiden.
508880	509880	Oh, really?
509880	511880	I thought I was frightening you.
511880	513880	Your voice is so shaky.
513880	516880	This isn't the way I sound normally.
516880	518880	Hey, be quiet.
518880	520880	No.
520880	522880	I can hear something.
522880	524880	Me, too.
524880	526880	Perhaps it's the wind.
526880	527880	No, Snork Maiden.
527880	529880	It sounds like someone moaning.
529880	531880	You can't scare me like that.
531880	532880	No one lives here.
532880	533880	Who want to live here anyway?
533880	535880	It's dark and cold.
535880	537880	It's moment and snuffkin.
537880	540880	They've climbed out and we can hear their voices in the distance.
540880	541880	So we needn't worry.
541880	543880	Why would they be moaning?
543880	545880	No, it's not them.
545880	549880	I'm gonna go and investigate.
552880	554880	Don't, little mind.
554880	557880	Please, please stop it.
558880	560880	Pull hard, Moomin.
567880	569880	Will this do?
569880	571880	Right, who's going first?
571880	572880	Me.
572880	574880	Okay, but please be careful.
574880	576880	I will.
588880	591880	Take it easy, Moomin.
591880	593880	There's no hurry.
599880	601880	Hey, are you alright, Moomin?
601880	603880	Yes, of course.
603880	605880	Moomin.
618880	620880	Help me!
625880	627880	Moomin, what's happened?
627880	629880	Talk to me.
629880	631880	Moomin, are you alright?
631880	632880	Oh, I don't know.
632880	633880	I think so.
633880	635880	My bottom's a little bit sore, though.
635880	638880	I'm sure I heard somebody scream just now.
638880	641880	Well, the Himmelin was down here, having a nap.
641880	642880	The Himmelin?
642880	645880	If this is another of your games, Moomin, I don't like it.
645880	647880	Mr. Himmelin, we were climbing down from the top.
647880	649880	We didn't know you were asleep.
649880	650880	That's not quite right.
650880	651880	I wasn't asleep.
651880	653880	I wasn't at all comfortable, you know.
653880	655880	Well, what were you doing here, then?
655880	660880	Well, to tell you the truth, I really haven't been quite myself lately.
660880	664880	You haven't lost any more rare stamps, have you, Mr. Himmelin?
664880	666880	I'm a contrary, Moomin.
666880	667880	I have them all.
667880	671880	Even the rarest, every single one.
671880	672880	Then, what's wrong?
672880	674880	That's good, isn't it?
674880	677880	I mean, my collection is complete.
677880	682880	I know one in the world has a better stamp collection than you have, Mr. Himmelin.
682880	684880	No, of course not mine is perfect.
684880	686880	There isn't a stamp I haven't got.
686880	690880	Rare ones, old ones, misprinted ones, I have them all.
690880	691880	I still don't understand.
691880	694880	There's no challenge, nothing to search for.
694880	697880	You're too young and you don't collect stamps.
697880	699880	Oh dear, me, dear me.
699880	701880	I'm beginning to understand.
702880	704880	He's not a collector anymore.
704880	706880	He's got all the stamps he could ever want.
706880	707880	That's the trouble.
707880	710880	It's not half as much fun.
710880	714880	That's why you're sad, isn't it, Mr. Himmelin?
714880	716880	Yes, it is. No fun.
716880	718880	No fun at all.
718880	719880	No, I understand.
719880	721880	I can see why you're upset.
721880	724880	And me falling on top of you like that didn't really help, did it?
724880	728880	Not exactly, Moomin.
729880	732880	Look who was taking a nap in the cave.
732880	734880	Oh, it's you, Mr. Himmelin.
734880	737880	So it must have been his snoring that we heard.
737880	739880	What a noise he was making.
739880	742880	I'd never ever snore.
743880	745880	You certainly do.
748880	752880	Robbys, look, if you promise not to tell anyone
752880	755880	I'll take you to see something very special.
755880	756880	What is it?
759880	761880	Oh, it's him!
761880	763880	He's in a home!
763880	765880	He's in a home!
765880	766880	He's in a home!
766880	768880	He's in a home!
768880	769880	He's in a home!
769880	770880	He's in a home!
770880	772880	He's in a home!
772880	773880	He's in a home!
773880	775880	He's in a home!
775880	777880	I think he could be repaired.
777880	778880	Of course it could.
778880	779880	Easy!
779880	781880	But you know you can't always tell.
781880	783880	The keel doesn't look too good.
783880	785880	Yes, we could take it out to see a no-time.
785880	787880	The sails got holes in it.
787880	789880	Hey, I can't find any owners.
790880	793880	You can paddle all-steer.
793880	796880	Look out, friends! It's going over!
802880	804880	Hey!
804880	806880	Hang on, everybody.
811880	815880	I've lost my confidence and it makes me feel very unhappy.
815880	818880	Well, it can happen to anyone, you know.
818880	819880	Even to you?
819880	821880	Well, not much, of course.
821880	824880	Lucky you. I just don't know what to do.
824880	827880	How can I get it back? There must be a way.
827880	829880	It's hard to say.
829880	833880	Everybody's different, but with me, it just happens.
837880	840880	I don't think I'll ever invent anything again.
840880	844880	Perhaps I'll have a break from my memoirs, too.
844880	845880	Tea time?
845880	847880	Oh, dear. What's the matter with you, too?
847880	849880	You look a bit down in the dumps.
849880	852880	You know I might have been a bit overconfident.
852880	854880	Me, too, I think.
857880	859880	Oh, hi there!
860880	861880	Mum and Mama!
861880	862880	Mum and Papa!
862880	864880	There's no need to yell.
864880	867880	We can hear you. Watch the matter, Sniff.
867880	871880	We found a boat on the beach. Come and have a look.
871880	873880	A shipwreck washed up on the shore.
873880	876880	It's not a wreck, and it's got a white sail.
876880	877880	Oh.
877880	880880	We're going to repair it, and then it'll be ours.
880880	882880	All right, I'm coming.
882880	885880	Come on, Snort. Let's take a look at this boat.
885880	887880	It could be just the thing to cheer us both up.
887880	890880	So, it's got a sail. A white sail, you say.
890880	892880	That could be extremely interesting.
896880	899880	It's a sturdy little craft. It's nicely built.
899880	901880	Well designed.
901880	904880	She's abandoned. So does that mean we can keep her?
910880	914880	It seems to be in pretty good condition except for the hole in the bottom.
914880	917880	You know, maybe that's why she was abandoned here.
917880	919880	You could be right, Sniffkin.
919880	922880	Finders keepers, you guys. Of course it makes it our boat.
922880	925880	You'd have to wait to see if anyone claims it first, little mind.
925880	927880	What shall we do then, Papa?
928880	931880	Well, first things first, we must repair the hole,
931880	935880	and then tire up securely in case there's a storm.
935880	937880	Absolutely.
937880	941880	Then if the owner comes, we ought to give her back to him.
941880	944880	Mind you, she might know she's here.
946880	949880	So, what are we going to do when we've repaired her?
949880	954880	It's bad for boats not to be yours, but we could sail the seven seas.
954880	956880	Yay!
958880	961880	I'd be happy just to explore around here.
961880	963880	Don't worry, Snort Maiden.
963880	967880	If we get big waves, we can sail between them, isn't that right, Mum and Papa?
967880	972880	Well, in a way. Come on, let's get to work.
972880	975880	How about you, Snort? Will you help us?
975880	977880	Yes, of course.
977880	980880	Can I do anything for you, Mum and Papa?
980880	982880	Yes, if you'd like to, Mr. Himmelon.
982880	986880	Well, I'm afraid I'm not much of a builder, but if there is something I could do.
986880	989880	Well, let's get her out of the water first, shall we?
989880	991880	Yes, Mum!
991880	995880	And we'll need some big logs to go under her.
995880	997880	I think ten should be enough.
997880	1000880	I'll be ten some. Let's go, prom!
1000880	1006880	Yes, you'll need to be safe to work on, so we'll want something strong to keep her upright as well.
1006880	1009880	And lots of tools.
1009880	1013880	I'll go home and get some, and I think we'll need a bucket and a shovel.
1013880	1016880	I'll come with you and help you choose.
1016880	1021880	Yes, you go. I'll stay and keep guard in case the owner comes back.
1039880	1046880	Sleep well.
1046880	1050880	Man, the top sales.
1050880	1053880	What?
1065880	1067880	Are they all in bed, my dear?
1067880	1069880	Yes, dear. Sleeping like logs.
1069880	1073880	I'm not surprised. They all work very, very hard today.
1073880	1077880	I can't wait until the boat's ready, and we can sail off somewhere.
1077880	1080880	My dear, we'll go anywhere in the world you like.
1080880	1084880	Anywhere at all you've only got to say and off will Jolly will go.
1084880	1086880	It doesn't have to be far, dear.
1086880	1090880	Let's get to bed, too. We've got an early start of the morning.
1090880	1095880	Oh! Intellectuals like me aren't used to this artwork.
1096880	1099880	Oh, I'm tired out, and I can hardly move.
1099880	1101880	Mama, I'd better put these tired legs to bed.
1101880	1105880	Good night, dear moment, Papa. This will be good for him, I think.
1105880	1111880	Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
1111880	1114880	A perfect fit, if I may say so.
1114880	1116880	Yeah, well, now for the rest of her.
1116880	1119880	Right.
1126880	1129880	Look at me, Moomin. I'm doing the Tari.
1129880	1133880	I know, little Mai. I'm only doing where you can't reach.
1133880	1137880	Oh, all right, then. Sniff you lazy land lover. Bring me some more Tari.
1137880	1142880	No, I won't. Get it yourself, you lazy thing. You wanted to do it.
1142880	1146880	I didn't want to carry Tari, though. And anyway, I'm the painter.
1146880	1149880	Come on, hurry up.
1150880	1155880	Moomin, Mama, should I cut it all out?
1155880	1158880	Yes, please, not me.
1170880	1173880	Hey, feeling all right, Mr. Hemmielin?
1173880	1176880	Yes, thank you. You're fixing the boat very quickly.
1176880	1179880	Yeah, we sure are, should be finished very soon.
1179880	1182880	Yes, I'm sure it will.
1182880	1186880	That's what I was afraid of. What shall I do then, Sniffkin?
1186880	1189880	Well, maybe you could start collecting something else. What do you think?
1189880	1191880	Something else, like what?
1191880	1194880	Well, I don't know. Anything, really?
1194880	1195880	How about butterflies?
1195880	1199880	No, my second cousin does that, and he's a complete idiot.
1199880	1202880	It has to be something interesting. Ornumans?
1202880	1203880	Ornumans?
1203880	1206880	Yeah, you could collect those forever. Not scientific.
1206880	1211880	Well, it's up to you, but I think you really ought to collect something, Mr. Hemmielin.
1218880	1220880	Mama! Mama!
1222880	1225880	Mama, quick, hurry up. We're going to launch the new boat.
1225880	1228880	All right, wait for me. I'm coming.
1228880	1232880	The sail you men had is perfect, Mama. Come on.
1233880	1237880	Are you ready, everybody? I'll count to three and then push as hard as you can.
1237880	1240880	One, two, three!
1256880	1260880	And so, with their new boat finally repaired and uncleaned,
1260880	1265880	Moomin and the others began to get very excited about their trip from the world.
1265880	1269880	Even Snork and Mr. Hemmielin were in unusually high spirits.
1269880	1272880	All aboard for a trial run.
1276880	1278880	I've decided what I'm going to collect.
1278880	1284880	Flowers, look, here's my first sample. It's a sweet fryer, Rosa Rubiconosa.
1284880	1287880	That's great. Good for you.
1287880	1292880	Snork, maiden. I've just had a new idea for my flying ship.
1292880	1295880	I'm certain it'll work this time.
1295880	1298880	Of course it will, Snork. Good luck.
1298880	1302880	I'd better get on. All right, start paddling, everyone.
1302880	1305880	We'll be back soon, my dear, Moomin Mama.
1305880	1310880	Take as long as you like, Papa. I'll prepare something cold for when you get back.
1310880	1313880	One, two, one, two.
1313880	1318880	The way, the way, the deep blue yonder.
1318880	1321880	One, two, one, two.
1327880	1334880	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1334880	1341880	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1341880	1345880	They're always happy and always at play.
1345880	1352880	The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.
1352880	1356880	The movements.
1356880	1363880	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1363880	1370880	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1370880	1375880	They're always happy and always at play.
1375880	1382880	The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.
1382880	1386880	The movements.
1386880	1392880	The movements.
