0	21000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here they are for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.
29000	36000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land.
36000	46000	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,
46000	58000	there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.
77000	104000	Captain Blood and his band of feared pirates had sailed the seas for many years,
104000	107000	but never could he remember a storm such as this.
107000	113000	He began to wonder whether his ship could withstand the battering and buffeting of the angry waves for much longer.
113000	119000	Alas, it is now too late to launch the lifeboat he thought, as he lashed himself to the wheel.
119000	121000	His voice rose against the wind.
121000	128000	Captain Blood can think of no better death than to journey to the bottom of the sea, losing the last battle against his old adversary.
129000	135000	But if only I could see the life of the young and beautiful princess who I rescued from the dupe scallion before a ciker,
135000	143000	I care not about the three chests of doubloons, two chests of jewels and 36 bales of the richest and most colorful silks,
143000	148000	but oh must she too perish in this terrible storm.
148000	150000	Is it a good book, Moonman?
150000	152000	Mmm, it's great.
153000	156000	What a terrible storm, it's not easing at all.
156000	157000	No.
157000	160000	I'm so glad I'm not on my own in a night like this.
160000	162000	I feel safe in Moonman's house.
163000	165000	Oh, what was that?
165000	167000	It sounded like a tree breaking.
168000	169000	Hey, Moonman.
169000	171000	Mmm, why don't you read your story out loud?
171000	172000	Oh, okay.
172000	174000	But can I start where I got to?
174000	180000	As long as you tell us what's happened before, we won't know what it's about, and we might have missed something important.
180000	182000	Just the main points will do, Moonman.
182000	184000	Well, there's this brave pirate.
184000	186000	It's so much fun when someone reads out loud.
186000	188000	Go on, Moonman.
188000	189000	Captain Blood.
189000	193000	And he and his men have captured a rich and royal gallery.
193000	197000	They've taken lots of gold, silver, and jewels and things.
197000	199000	And oh, yes, a princess too.
199000	201000	It's exciting, isn't it?
201000	202000	Yes, it is.
204000	209000	The storm that rose that night was so violent that at first,
209000	214000	it seemed inevitable the ship found before the waves had engulfed it.
214000	217000	Not bad, if I say so myself.
217000	222000	Captain Blood saw that the poor princess had indeed swooned.
222000	227000	With only the rats for company, how frightened she must have been down in the old.
227000	233000	The noise of the storm was deafening as the ship was thrown above under swirling sea.
233000	237000	The captain's brave heart went out to his young and beautiful captain.
237000	239000	Could I have some tea, Mama?
239000	241000	Of course, dear. Would you like me to bring it up to you?
241000	243000	No, thanks. I've finished for the day.
243000	246000	That's good. Shall we all have some tea and lemonade?
246000	249000	Yes, please. I'm very thirsty.
249000	251000	You read very well. Thank you, Moonman.
251000	253000	Great story, isn't it?
253000	255000	Could I have some strawberry juice, please, Mama?
255000	258000	Snork Maiden, when is your brother coming home?
258000	260000	Oh, he didn't say exactly.
260000	262000	But in a couple of days, I should think.
262000	266000	It was a good idea to let Snork make him stay while he was away.
266000	268000	Wasn't it, Papa?
268000	273000	Yes, it wouldn't be very nice to be all on your own at night in a storm like this.
273000	275000	Not at all.
289000	291000	She seems to be sinking.
291000	294000	She won't be able to hold out much longer.
294000	296000	We must get to the crew without delay.
296000	299000	How could we launch a boat in this weather?
299000	300000	Any survivors?
300000	303000	We haven't found anyone yet.
303000	306000	So what about further along the coast?
306000	309000	Any reports of survivors turning up?
309000	312000	No, I'm afraid not, Inspector. We haven't heard anything.
312000	314000	Well, tell me if you do.
314000	315000	Ah, Inspector?
315000	316000	Yes.
316000	319000	It seems to me it was a pirate ship that sunk.
319000	321000	What did you say?
322000	326000	Well, I'm pretty sure I saw the skull and crossbones flying from the mast.
326000	330000	And I think I caught sight of a cannon, but I could have been mistaken.
330000	331000	You must be joking.
331000	332000	I never joke.
332000	334000	I can't see anything.
334000	338000	It's too far away to make out any sort of skull and crossbones.
338000	339000	Try this.
339000	341000	Ah, you've got a telescope.
341000	344000	Now why didn't you let me have this before? It might have helped.
352000	353000	Oh!
361000	363000	Ah, that's it. She's gone.
368000	372000	I suppose that there aren't many pirate ships around today.
372000	376000	Any that are afloat must be so old that they'd probably break up easily.
376000	381000	That's if it was a pirate ship, but it sure looked like one right enough.
381000	384000	Nothing's been washed up on the shore yet.
384000	386000	No, not a thing.
389000	393000	Isn't it strange that I was reading that book about pirates yesterday?
393000	396000	They probably wouldn't be quite so romantic in real life.
396000	400000	Well, in the book they were really great. I wish I'd been one.
400000	401000	A pirate?
401000	403000	Yeah, what could be more exciting?
403000	404000	You can't mean that.
404000	410000	Oh, yes, I do. To sail across the seven seas, the holds of your ship's crowned with treasures.
410000	414000	But you'd have to steal the treasure from somebody first, so, Moomin.
414000	417000	Well, yes, all right. I suppose so.
417000	420000	But I wouldn't steal anything from anyone.
420000	424000	Then you're just a sailor. Not a pirate at all.
429000	431000	Moomin, Mama, do you know where Moomin is?
432000	434000	He's probably in Snuffkin's tent.
434000	435000	Oh, yes.
435000	438000	Nork Maiden, I have a letter for you.
438000	441000	Here you are. It's from the snork.
441000	444000	Oh, thank you. Wait a minute, little Mai.
444000	446000	I want to read Snork's letter.
446000	448000	Take your time.
455000	458000	Oh, what's the matter?
458000	461000	It's Snork. He's coming home today.
461000	462000	That's nice.
462000	465000	But Moomin, Mama, there's no food in the house at all.
465000	468000	Now, don't worry about that, Snork Maiden.
468000	472000	I'll whistle up some dinner for us, and Snork can tell us all about his trip.
472000	474000	Boom and Papa like that.
474000	477000	Oh, thank you, Mama. Snork doesn't like missing his meals.
477000	480000	He must have got the part sooner than he thought.
480000	482000	Ha! That's great news.
482000	484000	Then he should finish his flying ship soon, hey?
484000	486000	I guess so.
487000	489000	He should make it into a pirate flying ship.
489000	493000	I could be his first maid, and no one would be able to catch us.
493000	495000	Nobody at all!
498000	499000	Not here.
499000	503000	Oh, dear. I wonder where they've gone, little Mai.
503000	505000	There's nobody here.
505000	509000	Moomin probably wanted to go looking for an adventure.
509000	512000	I bet they went down to the beach to see if anything's been washed out.
512000	515000	At least the hangar's not been damaged.
515000	518000	Let's go down to the beach. We may find a treasure chest.
520000	521000	Huh?
524000	525000	What is it?
525000	528000	I just thought I heard something.
528000	530000	Where? From in there.
530000	532000	Hmm, weird.
532000	535000	Oh, I know. The snork must have come back.
535000	538000	Oh, yes. Snork. Of course.
539000	541000	Hello, Snork.
542000	544000	Oh, Snork? Are you in here?
546000	548000	Ah!
551000	553000	Snork me!
560000	562000	Put her down.
564000	567000	Oh, really? It was actually a pirate ship.
567000	571000	It was indeed Moomin, Papa, and we caught the pirates when they swam ashore.
571000	574000	Do you think you captured all of them, Inspector?
574000	578000	Well, of course, we don't know exactly how many there were to begin with.
578000	580000	Hmm, right.
580000	585000	We better barricade ourselves in Moomin's house just to be on the safe side.
585000	590000	Oh, dear. And I suppose I ought to stand guard over my greenhouse as well.
593000	596000	Lace me, ma'am. Come here, little panic.
596000	600000	Do let Snork me go. You'll be sorry. You great big hairy folly.
600000	605000	No, not in your life, though. It's just my hostage. I need her to make good my escape, ma'am.
605000	608000	Then you only have yourself to blame.
608000	610000	Hey, what?
610000	613000	Blame? Stay where you are now. I will not be bitten again.
613000	615000	Keep away, little cat.
615000	617000	Well, don't hurt her then.
617000	621000	Hurt her, you little shark. She's a hostage and I call me one of that.
621000	624000	She'll be my safe passenger. These rough waters are perished.
624000	626000	Well, then you better take me instead.
626000	628000	Because I'm much easier to carry.
628000	633000	You, huh? Nobody would care if I fed you slowly to the shrimps.
633000	636000	Oh, yes, lots of people. When you overstab win, ma'am.
636000	641000	All right, all right. Hold your head with gloomy down. Now, what's your name, girl?
641000	642000	I'm Lil Mai.
642000	647000	Well, I'm Captain Rumpod. Now, go and get whatever authorities you have in this backwater.
647000	649000	Hurry, my patience is short.
649000	653000	I'll only go if you promise that you won't hurt Snork Maiden.
653000	655000	Of course, I won't.
655000	659000	If I find that you've hurt her in any way at all, my revenge will be terrible.
659000	662000	All right, all right, all right.
685000	693000	Captain Rumpod, you are surrounded. Let Snork Maiden go.
693000	695000	Do you hear me, Captain?
695000	698000	To a gold button-land lover like you never.
698000	702000	She's a good-looking wench, fair skinned and nicely rounded.
702000	706000	Pirates prefer blondes. Give me a ship and you can have her back.
706000	709000	What do you say to let my buck-hole?
709000	711000	You're on your own, Captain.
711000	714000	We've got all your men locked up tight.
714000	716000	All me crew?
716000	720000	You're the last one. Now, let her go immediately.
720000	724000	Thank you for saving me crew. I feared they were all lost.
724000	727000	Don't thank me. They're all in jail.
727000	731000	Someone's saying it's the best place for them, but not me.
731000	734000	Now, let them out. I need them. And a proper ship.
734000	738000	Oh, with two masks and fifty cannon. And no tricks.
738000	741000	Else, it'll be worse for the girl.
742000	744000	This is too much.
744000	747000	The school for constables didn't tell us about this.
747000	750000	What should we do, Inspector?
752000	754000	Please get Snork Maiden away from him.
754000	757000	I'm afraid he'll hurt her and she'll be frightened.
757000	760000	I'm trying my best, but it's very awkward all this.
760000	762000	I've not come across anything like it before.
762000	766000	Oh, but it's not her fault that it's ship's anchor, Inspector.
766000	769000	I know, I know. Oh, dear, oh dear.
769000	772000	Oh, I should have been a gardener.
772000	774000	Hey, are you still there, you ruffian?
774000	777000	Let my men go and get my ship.
777000	779000	Two masks and fifty cannon mine.
779000	783000	Look, Captain Rumpod, I'm afraid that times have changed.
783000	786000	Sailing ships don't have cannon these days.
786000	789000	Shiver me timbers. How do you sink each other then?
789000	792000	I don't try to fool me. Remember, I've got the girl.
792000	796000	I think Moomin Papa has an old blender bus I'm sure he'll let you have.
796000	799000	I don't know if it'll work, though. That's all I've got.
799000	803000	I'm one of you, Peabrain. This is my final word, so listen well.
803000	809000	You have two hours to get the ship ready to sail and all my crew with her mine.
809000	811000	Or else I'll...
811000	814000	Now, don't worry, my pretty one. I won't harm a single hair on your head,
814000	817000	but I must have something to threaten them with.
817000	820000	Or else I'll feed her to the hungry shot.
820000	822000	Ah!
822000	824000	Oscar, I won't hurt you.
824000	825000	Are you sure?
825000	829000	Either I get my ship, Oak 50 cannon and at least two masters
829000	833000	you'll be food for lobsters. It's your choice, my hearty!
833000	835000	I should do it.
837000	840000	He sounds as if he'll do it, too.
840000	844000	Two hours, he says, the real feeder to the sharks. Oh, dear, oh, dear.
844000	848000	What will Snork say, oh, dear, oh, dear?
848000	850000	Ah!
850000	852000	I have a great idea, sir.
852000	857000	Why don't we climb onto the roof, drill a hole and then drop some on his head?
857000	861000	You know, Constable, I've always thought you were an idiot, now you've proved it.
861000	863000	Excuse me, Inspector.
863000	867000	If we set fire to the henna, then they'll have to come out, won't they?
867000	871000	Shut up! Why am I surrounded by fools?
871000	873000	Oh, this is no good.
873000	877000	I must calm down, I must calm down.
877000	879000	Captain Rumbot!
879000	881000	Can you hear me, Captain?
881000	884000	Ah-ha, you found a ship already, have you?
884000	889000	Well, no, there aren't any real sailing ships in Moomin Valley.
889000	891000	The chief Constable has a yacht.
891000	895000	He doesn't usually let anyone borrow it, but I'm sure in this case he...
895000	898000	I want something big enough to take me to the Spanish main!
898000	899000	I warned you!
899000	903000	Calm down, Captain. Calm down. Now just listen to me.
903000	907000	You haven't done anything wrong here. No pirating or such like.
907000	910000	So if you forget about the boat, we'll let you all go. Think about it.
910000	913000	Free to go anywhere you like, on foot, of course.
913000	919000	The fresh air, the sun on your face, no worry of shipwrecks, no storms at sea.
919000	921000	What do you think we are?
921000	923000	Huh, we're pirates, not highwaymen.
923000	926000	It's not so bad being a highwayman, you know.
926000	930000	There'll be lots of rich travelers on the other side of Lonely Mountain, I'm sure.
930000	933000	And lots of adventures with jewels and gold.
933000	936000	Day me with flagens are rubbing a chicken brain, nitwit!
937000	938000	Nitwit?
938000	941000	No, niggum poop, dumb bill! I'm Captain Rumpot!
941000	943000	You're making me very angry!
943000	948000	If I had you on my ship, you'd dangle from the yard. I mean, what the play?
948000	951000	The inspector's losing control. We had better call me down.
953000	957000	What the clank would I, and then Mike prison you'd get no butter on their breath,
957000	959000	and maggots on your biscuits?
960000	962000	Please calm down, Inspector.
962000	963000	The pilot's there!
963000	964000	All right!
964000	965000	Calm down, pick it easy!
965000	966000	Are you sure?
966000	967000	We water!
967000	969000	I'd see through it that the bread was milled!
976000	978000	That's 30 minutes gone already!
986000	988000	I warned you, gold button.
988000	992000	But now there is only one hour to her painful and horrible death!
997000	1000000	Cheer up, snark maiden! Try and hold on!
1000000	1002000	We'll get you out!
1002000	1004000	Water!
1004000	1005000	Water!
1005000	1007000	Huh? What did you say?
1007000	1009000	Water, please. I'm so thirsty!
1009000	1011000	Water?
1011000	1013000	Nasty stuff, still.
1013000	1015000	Hey, land lovers!
1015000	1018000	Compliments to the galley! The young lady wants a drink!
1018000	1022000	All right, captain. I'm coming, smart maiden.
1022000	1024000	I'll take it, Inspector.
1024000	1027000	It's too dangerous. You must leave it to us now, moment.
1028000	1029000	Just a minute, Inspector.
1030000	1034000	I think we should let moment go, and I've got an idea that just might work.
1034000	1035000	Snuff him!
1035000	1039000	It'll take an awful lot of courage, and you'll have to do it all on your own.
1039000	1040000	Do you think you can do it, moment?
1040000	1041000	Of course.
1046000	1051000	This place made me raise what's taken him so long, keeping a young lady waiting.
1051000	1054000	It's all right. I really don't mind waiting.
1054000	1057000	Tell you the truth. I can do it and drink myself.
1057000	1061000	It's thirsty work, shun an idiot policeman. Don't you worry, little one.
1061000	1063000	They'll be here soon.
1063000	1067000	Get me a drink, too, you hear, and quick about it!
1067000	1071000	I've brought you something to drink, captain.
1072000	1075000	All right, come on, then. And no funny stuff.
1075000	1078000	Don't worry. I'm on my own.
1078000	1080000	Have you done a drink for me, too?
1080000	1081000	Yes, captain.
1081000	1084000	All right, stay there and put down the tray.
1086000	1090000	The bigger one is for you, captain, and the little one for snark maiden.
1090000	1092000	Now move away.
1094000	1096000	And for enough, stay there.
1097000	1101000	Hmm. Why is it so red?
1102000	1106000	Well, it's strawberry juice. It's very good.
1110000	1114000	I'll be polite. She can drink from this one, and I'll have hers.
1114000	1118000	But, captain, there's not enough for you in the small one.
1118000	1121000	Strawberry juice isn't exactly my favorite tip of your know.
1121000	1123000	No, the small one will do.
1124000	1126000	Here you are, young lady.
1126000	1130000	No, no snark maiden. Please, don't drink it.
1130000	1134000	Why not, my young bucko? It's not poison, is it?
1134000	1137000	Don't be silly. Poisoned? Oh, no, no.
1137000	1140000	Perhaps a sleeping potion.
1142000	1147000	Hmm. As I thought, I deemed in mighty strange that two cups were prepared.
1147000	1148000	You drink it.
1148000	1151000	Oh, no, no, no, sir. I'm not thirsty at all.
1152000	1156000	What's the matter, me lad? You said the drink wasn't poison, didn't you?
1156000	1157000	So drink.
1157000	1158000	No, man.
1158000	1161000	Ah, you're her swing, are you?
1161000	1166000	I shall never understand women anyway. One of you will have to drink it, and now.
1167000	1170000	Not her. I'll do it. I'll do it. Give it to me.
1170000	1174000	No, woman, don't. There's something in it. You'll be poisoned.
1174000	1179000	It's all right, snark maiden. It's nothing dangerous. Don't worry about me.
1179000	1181000	I'll drink it.
1184000	1187000	That's it. Drink up again.
1190000	1193000	Down the hatch, me lad.
1194000	1197000	You're lucky and wasn't poisoned.
1197000	1199000	Yeah.
1199000	1202000	And no sleeping potion, neither?
1202000	1206000	Oh, no, nothing at all. Nothing.
1209000	1212000	Oh, woman. Oh, no, woman.
1212000	1214000	You're not my pretty one.
1214000	1218000	Your wimpy little bow is just taking a nap. You'll be right as rain's soon.
1221000	1224000	And he thought he could fool me.
1224000	1227000	Me, Captain Rumpot, the cheek of it.
1227000	1229000	Well, I'll have the other one.
1232000	1234000	Not bad.
1235000	1239000	No, I'm sorry, young lady. They'll have to bring you another.
1239000	1245000	Shall we order one without the draft? They'll be surprised when they see me still on my pins.
1245000	1249000	Why do I not sleep at all?
1250000	1253000	Let's go and give my surprise.
1253000	1255000	Help!
1260000	1264000	Oh, woman!
1265000	1267000	A woman!
1267000	1270000	It's all right. I'm okay snark maiden.
1270000	1273000	There's nothing in this drink. Would you like some?
1273000	1275000	A woman, you mean you?
1275000	1279000	Well, I was pretending. So I convinced you too, huh?
1279000	1281000	A woman!
1284000	1289000	Captain Rumpot didn't wake up that day, or the next.
1289000	1294000	And when he did, he had a terrible headache, which served him right.
1301000	1304000	The inspector let all the pirates go after a week.
1304000	1307000	Well, they hadn't done any pirating in Moomin Valley.
1307000	1311000	And wouldn't be doing any either. Not without a ship.
1313000	1316000	I'm sorry.
1322000	1328000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1328000	1336000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1336000	1340000	They're always happy and always at play.
1340000	1347000	The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.
1347000	1351000	The movements.
1351000	1358000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1358000	1365000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1366000	1369000	They're always happy and always at play.
1369000	1376000	The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.
1376000	1380000	The movements.
1380000	1386000	The movements.
