01:16.240 --> 01:28.240
there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments

01:28.240 --> 01:40.240
there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments

01:40.240 --> 01:52.240
there you are

01:52.240 --> 02:02.240
oops

02:02.240 --> 02:12.240
we weren't looking where we were going that's all right thank you think of me are you going out

02:12.240 --> 02:20.240
yes for a walk we'll have fun

02:20.240 --> 02:26.240
it seems that thingamy and bob are well and truly part of movement house now

02:26.240 --> 02:30.960
luckily they don't eat a lot and are small enough to find the pencils that fall

02:30.960 --> 02:38.240
between the floorboards in the porch

02:38.240 --> 02:44.240
hey this looks like a great hiding place nobody would ever find it here

02:44.240 --> 02:48.800
come on bob let's go get the suitcase man are you sure it's not safe for an

02:48.800 --> 02:55.800
arm what would you say someone went in when we went there you wouldn't like it would

02:55.800 --> 03:02.800
you I think the movements are much too nice to do anything like that it's not

03:02.800 --> 03:09.800
them it's the guess I'm thinking about you know the movements let anybody stay

03:09.800 --> 03:16.800
snorke maiden you lied to me little my homie

03:16.800 --> 03:22.800
moment still has the shell that I gave him but you said that he didn't impossible

03:22.800 --> 03:28.800
movement mama gave it to the grove I was there when she did it look I saw it he showed it to me

03:28.800 --> 03:34.800
are you really sure was it the same one of course it was I'm not stupid you know

03:34.800 --> 03:40.800
that's very odd I saw her do it with my own eyes well I'll go and ask moving right now

03:40.800 --> 03:47.800
little my it's a bit awkward but if I'm going to be honest snorke maiden what well

03:47.800 --> 03:52.800
I've decided that from now on I'm only going to tell the truth oh yes and I found

03:52.800 --> 03:57.800
something you might be interested in what is it mumble and I were down on the beach

03:57.800 --> 04:01.800
yesterday and you remember all those things we found washed up by the storm do you

04:01.800 --> 04:06.800
mean on the hatty fatter's island that we sailed to yes and do you remember the

04:06.800 --> 04:11.800
figurehead that movement like best of all you know the lady made of wood and

04:11.800 --> 04:17.800
painted she was really lovely wasn't she yes I remember movement wanted to keep it

04:17.800 --> 04:23.800
so what about it well it's here on the beach it was still the same as beautiful

04:23.800 --> 04:28.800
as ever we said the same one yes I remember her pretty face don't legs though

04:28.800 --> 04:34.800
she's just a silly wooden doll oh I know that but she's got those gorgeous eyes and

04:34.800 --> 04:39.800
lovely long hair little my why all this fuss about this silly figurehead

04:39.800 --> 04:43.800
trust him only someone as stupid as movement could fall in love with a figurehead

04:43.800 --> 04:48.800
it's probably still dreaming about her every night do you think it's still there

04:48.800 --> 04:53.800
Jars snorke maiden if no one else has found her already do you think the ocean

04:53.800 --> 04:58.800
might come and wash her away again why all these silly questions snorke maiden

04:58.800 --> 05:04.800
woman would go and rescue her if he knew so that would be terrible I couldn't

05:04.800 --> 05:10.800
bear it at all I really couldn't how pathetic he'll probably take her home

05:10.800 --> 05:16.800
and keep her in his room forever my expect she's too big to go through the door

05:16.800 --> 05:21.800
he'll just sit and stare at her with that lovesick look on his face I know he will

05:21.800 --> 05:26.800
oh where are you going now I thought you were going to move in house I was but

05:26.800 --> 05:28.800
there's something more important I have to do

05:28.800 --> 05:35.800
okay it's clear

05:44.800 --> 05:50.800
hey you two you're not leaving are you no we're just uh we're going

05:50.800 --> 05:56.800
why have you got the suitcase them look woman would you help us with something

05:56.800 --> 06:05.800
of course thank you very much woman oh that's okay it's a bit too big for you to

06:05.800 --> 06:12.800
carry we can take it from here it's all right it's not very heavy

06:12.800 --> 06:18.800
oh silly me it wouldn't be a very secret place if I'd seen it would it I'll see you

06:18.800 --> 06:23.800
later don't be too long now of course I won't

06:35.800 --> 06:41.800
hey what are you doing up there little my I'm coming down what does it look like

06:41.800 --> 06:46.800
you're much too small to do that the rungs are too far apart for you to reach

06:46.800 --> 06:53.800
just you watch me

06:59.800 --> 07:05.360
movement I have a problem do you mind if I ask you something go ahead did

07:05.360 --> 07:12.040
movement mama give snorke means heart shape shell to the grove yes she did so

07:12.040 --> 07:18.040
you and the grove can't both have it can you that's just where you're wrong but

07:18.040 --> 07:25.040
that's simply impossible you can't have the grove simply got another one that's not true

07:25.040 --> 07:30.040
all right but it would only upset snorke made an if she knew so I'm not going to

07:30.040 --> 07:35.040
tell her you rotten thing why don't you just tell me the truth because it's a

07:35.040 --> 07:41.040
secret but I want to know movement look movement now why don't you tell me your

07:41.040 --> 07:48.040
secret and then I'll tell you mine what is it really very top secret go on then tell me

07:48.040 --> 07:55.040
tell me yours first no you tell me first I know let's say them together all right

07:55.040 --> 08:02.040
ready one two three after we go and I went to the beach yesterday I'm out there we'll

08:02.040 --> 08:09.040
make you like it what did you say the figure head by the

08:09.040 --> 08:16.040
K wait a minute you didn't finish telling me your secret I'll tell you later that's

08:16.040 --> 08:23.040
not there you've got to tell me now

08:32.040 --> 08:48.040
what do you think moments to let I don't know maybe he's looking for shells again

08:48.040 --> 08:58.040
I don't think so he looks a bit worried to me maybe he's lost something important

08:58.040 --> 09:05.040
how much further do we have to go as far as you can road where a long way out

09:05.040 --> 09:10.040
already I know I want to make sure that the lady will never turn up again we must go

09:10.040 --> 09:17.040
further out we must be far enough by now I'm tired no the currents could still drag her

09:17.040 --> 09:21.040
in from here keep going

09:28.040 --> 09:35.040
he looks very unhappy we've got to cheer him up but how is only one way Bob yet you're

09:35.040 --> 09:38.040
right thing to me

09:46.040 --> 09:54.040
hello look so sad moment that we thought we try make you happy again

09:54.040 --> 10:02.040
you don't mind do you know but you don't have to I'm all right really

10:02.040 --> 10:07.040
how about this then moment we're going to show you what's in our suitcase

10:07.040 --> 10:15.040
would you like that moment it's very interesting oh my gosh will you

10:15.040 --> 10:26.040
do you need some help in there no I think we can manage

10:34.040 --> 10:44.040
now we'll open it yes now one two three oh gosh by my tail

10:44.040 --> 10:51.040
do you like it oh boy do I like it then you're not sad anymore then oh no

10:51.040 --> 11:04.040
that's good isn't it it was such a beautiful ruby how it changed color from soft red

11:04.040 --> 11:09.040
to sapphire blue and then to pink one minute it was like a flame leaping out of the

11:09.040 --> 11:14.040
center then suddenly it was like a blood tulip it was perhaps that's the king's

11:14.040 --> 11:21.040
ruby it was just beautiful that's the one the hob goblin the searching for oh

11:21.040 --> 11:27.040
no however far away is he'll come back on his black panther looking for it and he's

11:27.040 --> 11:32.040
sure to find it because he'll know that thing of me and Bob have it first the

11:32.040 --> 11:41.040
groke and allow the hob goblin what are we going to do no more than a week

11:41.040 --> 11:54.040
later and like a bolt from the blue a real catastrophe hit mumen valley no it's not

11:54.040 --> 11:59.880
in the bedroom either that's very odd where did you see it last I'm sure it was

11:59.880 --> 12:06.880

12:06.880 --> 12:13.880
