Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're here for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They are the movements.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So what do you think?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. There with me, there for you on your TV, there are the moments,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There are the moments, so come with me, give me your hand

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird

Mama waters the flowers.

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.379
While Papa relaxes in the shade on the porch.

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:46.799
Look, Mama, aomin Papa is sleeping again.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.799
Hmm.

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:50.599
You had a long nap yesterday.

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.000
I think it must be the weather.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.599
It's too hot and sunny for me.

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:55.599
I wonder if he's worried about anything.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.799
You don't sleep if you're worried you do something about it.

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:13.400
But Moomin Papa does have something on his mind, although it doesn't keep him awake.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:27.000
He's having a nice dream as well. Oh, a lighthouse.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
That's it.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Oh, that's it. A lighthouse.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
What about a lighthouse, Papa?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We're going to visit one.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
When?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Right now. Well, as soon as I find one anyway. Lighthouse. What about a lighthouse, Papa? We're going to visit one.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
When?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Right now.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Well, as soon as I find one anyway.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
That should stop you being bored, Mama.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Oh, I'm not really dear, but it would be nice.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Yeah.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Oh, I'm really excited.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Just the time's letting lovely water.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'll write an exciting, epic novel of the sea.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'm sure it will be a great success.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
If he puts some action in it, misses out the romantic stuff.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Stop it!

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Tell me, does Moomin Papa want all of you to go away to this lighthouse?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Oh yes, it'll be great fun. Just think of all the ships we'll be able to see.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Yes, that will be good.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.460
Papa says he wants to write an exciting story about the sea, with ships and storms and stuff. Probably pirates too.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.939
Oh, he's stuck writing his memoirs again, is he?

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:55.060
Well, I guess that might have something to do with it, but I think he just wants another adventure.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.840
He's bored.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.080
Well, it sounds a bit odd to me, Moomin.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.240
No, it's not.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.560
We're going to live in a real lighthouse and save ships from the rocks and being wrecked terrible storms.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.719
Oh, I see. What do you think the lighthouse keeper might say about you moving in?

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:13.840
Oh he won't mind at all. It'll be company for it and I'm sure he'd like someone to talk to.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.399
Looking after lighthouses a very lonely job.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:21.600
Ah but if you thought Moomin that might be exactly why he chooses to do it.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.800
You mean that he might want to be on his own all the time?

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.360
Well, some people like it like that.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.120
Sometimes I like being on my own.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.360
Not for long though.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.720
It'll be a lot of fun.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.160
Snuffkin, why don't you come with us?

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.399
What to a lonely lighthouse?

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:42.399
Yes.

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:52.720
Oh no, which one is it is it there that's the one. Where? So small you can hardly see it.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.240
How long would it take us to get their movement Papa? A day or two I should say

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:05.000
depending on the wind. But it looks so tiny. Oh I don't know. Well I think think so. How do we know which one is which?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Oh, don't you worry about that.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I've got an old compass somewhere,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and we've got the map, then at night,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
we'll be able to see the light itself.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Anyway, an old sailor.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
An old sailor?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Well, I'm not really that young.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And an old sailor.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Is this mutiny?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Don't be stupid.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
How long do you think you'll want to stay, Papa?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
About a month.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Oh, we'll need to take lots and lots of food then.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Well, bless me.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I think that'll be enough, Mama.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Surely there'll be somebody living there already.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Don't be stupid.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Of course there is.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
A lighthouse must have a keeper.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Yes, a man dedicated to the sea,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.040
suffering loneliness and hardship,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.879
saving countless lives with no regard for his own.

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:57.040
Is that you, Sniff?

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.800
Yes, hi, Mr. Hemmillon.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.439
I thought you'd be busy packing for the trip to the lighthouse.

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:05.000
No, well, I'm not going with them this time.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I decided to stay here.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Oh dear me really, Snuffkin said he was going.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Well I have something very important to do.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Important?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Sniff is just a big whip that's all.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Oh shut up little mind.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Don't tell me to shut up.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I don't listen to whims.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Now now children, no squabbling.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.699
It wouldn't be fair to the others. I'm not a very good swimmer.

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:30.000
You mean if you fell and then we're drowning, we'd have to jump in and save you.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Don't fall in then. Anyway, you can hang on to an or something.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
What if it got swept away?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
We'll put a life jacket on you stupid, don't worry.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
What about the sharks? They might take a fancy to me.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.399
Wait a minute. I know I'm not as aologist, but I don't think there are any sharks around

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:46.399
here.

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:48.399
I'm sure I would have heard if there were.

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:49.399
Ugh.

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:56.800
Well, it's a real fine day for sailing.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.199
Where are Mama and the others?

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.000
Don't worry, Moments.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.399
There's no hurry.

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:04.800
Are you sure that isn't too heavy for you, Sniff?

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.639
No, not at all, Mama.

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.360
It's a shame that you're not coming with us,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.040
but if you've got something important to do, you must do it.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.680
It won't be the same without you, though.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.839
We'll miss you, Sniff.

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:15.720
Thank you.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.079
Oh, dear, I left a jar of strawberry jam

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:21.079
in a whole batch of pancakes on the kitchen table.

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:22.879
Do you think you could manage to eat them?

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.319
Leave it to me.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.319
Hi, you'll be lucky if there's any food left in the

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:27.040
lard or mama.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.639
He's a my.

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:30.879
Off we go then.

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:33.720
Ike is away.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.480
He won't have to road too hard.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.720
The wind will pick us up soon.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.480
Goodbye.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.519
Have a good time, everyone.

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:42.920
Goodbye, Snuffkin.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.000
Now, don't forget to shut all the windows

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.240
if it rains, will you?

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.240
No.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.240
No.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.240
No.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.240
No.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.240
No.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.240
No.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.240
No.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.240
No.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.240
No.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.240
No.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.240
No.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.240
No.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.240
No.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.240
Hey!

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.240
Wake for me.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.240
I want to have a good time.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.000
Cool. Hey, wake. Huh? I want to have a good time too!

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Hey, stay away!

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Huh?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I'm here!

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Look, Sniff is still waving.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
He's a sweet boy.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Let's keep waving, Moonman, till we're out of sight.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Bye, Sniff! Bye, bye!

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Bye, bye!

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Bye! No, not waving! Bye, bye! Bye! Bye!

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
No, I'm not waving goodbye over the cutscene!

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Don't eat other old Mary Tam, I've got...

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
It's no good shouting, little Mai. He can't hear you.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
He's giving us a great send-off though,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
for Snape should have come with us.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Nancy, I'm going off and leaving me here on my own.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Snuffkin, if you wouldn't mind, I think we need some music to send us on our way.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:27.000
What do you say? Are you sure we're on the right course with the island, Papa?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Yes, the winds with us and the sails are fine.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I bet if we keep this speed up, we'll be there by tomorrow.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Well, if the wind stays like this, you could be right.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
The wind's not dying down at all.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I'm surprised. I never thought we'd keep up this speed.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Now make sure you're allergic to them.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Of course we will be, Papa. If we carry on like this,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
perhaps we'll see the light from the lighthouse while it's still dark.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Well, we don't want to hit anything at this speed.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Don't worry. We're watching.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Ah, this is the life.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Papa, the wind's dropped. I'm going to have to go to the house. I'm going to have to go to the house. I'm going to have to go to the house. I'm going to have to go to the house.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I'm going to have to go to the house.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I'm going to have to go to the house. I'm going to see the lighthouse at night.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
It's getting foggy too.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I can't even see the stars anymore.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Right, snuffkin. Wake me in two hours and I'll take over.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Okay, Moomin, Papa. What's the matter, little my?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I thought I heard something.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Oh.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
It's coming from over there somewhere.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Can you see anything?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
No, but I can hear it.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
So can I. Can you see anything? No. But I can hear it.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
So good I, and it's getting closer.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Little.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
MUMMUM POP!

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Get up, MUMMUM!

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Stop it, little my!

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
What's the matter with you?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
You two, move in quickly before it's too late!

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
What's the matter, little my?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I can hear a ship. Stop it, little Mai! What's the matter with you? You too, move in quickly, before it's too late!

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
What's the matter, little Mai?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I can hear her ship! I can't see it, but it's very close and getting closer.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
A ship? Where?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Over there, and she's bearing down on us.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Quickly, we don't have much time.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Yes, by the boobalier right.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
We must let them know we're here, a signal. Right? All hands on deck.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Maybe if we all shout as loud as we can.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Look!

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Oh!

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Too late for shouting.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
It's huge!

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Look out! It's gonna hit us!

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I think movement's right. What can we do?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
It's too late for anything. Just brace ourselves and be ready to swim for it.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Quick! Get down from the line!

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I don't believe it! I will buy!

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Huh?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
That's hard! The ship didn't hit us!

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Oh yes, she did.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
What?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
It went straight into our rudder when nothing happened.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It went right through us.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Right through us, that's impossible she couldn't have.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I wonder if there was anyone on board that ship.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I can't see any lights.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I know, Snuffkin, I think it's a ghost ship.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
A ghost ship?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.799
Well, there's no wash and no damage to us.

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:29.100
It's the only explanation. I think she's right.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.799
A ghost ship. We've actually seen one.

00:13:38.799 --> 00:13:43.000
Oh dear, oh dear. I need to sit down. All this excitement's too much.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Papa, don't they say that if you see a ghost ship something terrible is going to happen to you?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.500
What happened in the first place to make it become a ghost ship? That's what I want to know.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:59.000
Well that's just some old sailor's tale moment. If it had been a real ship we'd probably be sinking now.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Don't you think so, it's enough kid.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.500
Yeah, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.200
Come on, cheer up you guys!

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.000
At least it was fun!

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Yeah!

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
What's the matter?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
There's something happening.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
What are you laughing at?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
It's so funny!

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Are you going to tell us?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Why didn't you wake me up, you little?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Well, I think you would be very rude.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Oh, what a beautiful sky.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Just look at it.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Oh, the's it dozed off? Oh, another beautiful day, not a ghost ship in sight.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Oh!

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
The lighthouse!

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Oh, what a beautiful day!

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Oh, what a beautiful day!

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Oh, what a beautiful day!

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Oh, what a beautiful day!

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Oh, what a beautiful day!

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Oh, what a beautiful day!

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:26.179
Oh, what a beautiful day! Oh, what a beautiful day, not a ghost ship for hours. Oh, there it is. This is ridiculous.

00:15:26.179 --> 00:15:27.820
We've been next to it all night.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.620
We could have gone and slept there.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.899
I can't wait to go ashore.

00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:33.519
All right, everyone.

00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:34.720
Jump to it.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.620
Man the old.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:36.460
Great.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.460
Let's go.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.259
There's something strange going on here.

00:15:42.259 --> 00:15:44.059
What is it, Snowfgan?

00:15:44.059 --> 00:15:45.000
I'm not sure.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Woman Papa.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Our boat didn't move at all last night, did it?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
No, it doesn't seem to have moved at all.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So why couldn't we see the light from the lighthouse, even when the fog cleared?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I can't work it out.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Yes, you're right, Snuffkin. It seems very odd.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
We should have seen it.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.879
Well, perhaps the lighthouse keeper forgot to put it on, Moomin Papa.

00:16:05.879 --> 00:16:07.440
I don't think so, little Mai.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.000
You can't forget a thing like that.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.399
I suppose it could be broken.

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:14.519
There could be lots of reasons for it.

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:16.759
Why don't we hurry up and get a shore,

00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:17.960
and then we can ask the keeper.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.000
Look, there's someone in a boat!

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Hmm.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
It looks like he's fishing.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
He know about the lighthouse.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
He probably lives on the island.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Let's get closer. Easy now.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Ahoi there, good morning.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Any luck?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Not yet, but it's still early.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Hmm, yes, quite a... I'll ask him straight out.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Do you know if the lighthouse was working last night?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I don't know.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
He said, no, it wasn't.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
What did I tell you? He forgot to light it.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Oh, it wasn't only last night. You'll never see a light in that lighthouse.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Not even on stormy nights.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Never. So what does the keeper do then?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.480
Nothing. There is does the keeper do then? Nothing.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.480
There is an lighthouse keeper.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480
Why?

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.480
I'm sorry.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.759
I'm afraid I don't know.

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:34.680
All I can say is I haven't seen one.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.039
Do you live on the island?

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:38.039
Hey, mister.

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:40.960
You're asking too many questions.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.200
Who are you?

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.200
Huh?

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.740
I'm Moment Papa from from Moment Valley and this is my

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.079
family. We've come a long way in order to do some important work. You know work on

00:17:50.079 --> 00:17:56.180
this island. No, you better go back home. You see I've come here to research an

00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:02.140
epic novel about the sea. Just turn around and go back. You're too far from home.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.000
Oh please wait!

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Shh, dear, don't shout. We mustn't scare the fish away.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Let's go a show and have some breakfast. I expect we're all hungry.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Bunny, Pear. The old ones lost his marbles.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.500
Look, Moomin Papa, there's a path here leading to the lighthouse.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
We'll leave this stuff here and we'll go and explore it first. Right, to the lighthouse everyone!

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Up!

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Oh!

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Come on!

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Oh!

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
What's wrong?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Why do you always get so upset when somebody mentions the lighthouse?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
It's not your call, sir, and business. Business boy doesn't concern you at all.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.000
You were like that when I asked you about it before. Maybe if you were to tell me, I might be able to understand. I could try anyway.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Either talk about something else or keep quiet. Do you understand that? It's so very rocky I don't think it would work what a garden Hello there! Is there anybody at home?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000
There's nobody here! That boy was right! It's been empty for ages I think!

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Oh the door was left unlocked! I know we do it but most people don't!

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Something terrible's happened! Something terrible! Please little my you know! Oh, the door was left unlocked. I know we do it, but most people don't.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Something terrible's happened. Something terrible. Please, little my. You know I hate things like that.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Don't worry, snort maidun. Little my is just trying to scare you.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
I don't like hearing about anything horrible.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Flag your ears, then snort maidun, because I haven't finished yet, and the next bit's really horrible.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Oh, well, where have you been finished there?

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Well, the lighthouse keeper is still up there.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
He got scurvy and had to be able to move for months.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And nobody's heard his cries for help,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
and with no food he's almost to skeleton.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
If he isn't dead already, he'll be at the top of the stairs

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
crawling towards his his fingers,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
lading and ripped up ribbons of flow of smoke!

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
God, my death was terrible as ribbons and flowers, mouth, garbage, that was tiseless mouth!

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.119
Shut up, little mime!

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:49.000
Reminds right, that's enough.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.680
Hmm, it was a good imagination though.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.000
I'll let you use it in your book if you like.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.960
Oh, come on.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.839
Tell me what did she say, Moonman?

00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:58.039
Oh, nothing, really.

00:20:58.039 --> 00:20:59.200
Nothing at all.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.559
Tell me, Moonman, but leave out the bits I wouldn't like.

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:05.200
Where are you going, Papa?

00:21:05.759 --> 00:21:07.759
Well, listen, everyone.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.400
First, I'm going to get the lamp working.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.720
Then we'll give the place a good clean and then we'll move in.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:21.400
We'll be the new lighthouse keepers, and once again the seas around this island will be safe for ships to navigate in troubled water.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.400
Good old Papa!

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.400
Great!
