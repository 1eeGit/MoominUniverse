00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:54,160
mumen valley little did snuffkin know that before he came back the underwater volcano which

11
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:06,240
had kept quiet ever since mumen papa's youth would wake up again

12
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:16,960
what's all that smoke is it the volcano and your father's memoirs

13
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,440
I don't think I like this I think it's exciting oh in that case you can have it

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,320
woman snork maiden who had as many faces as there are mirrors in this room I don't like that look

every mirror has a chair in front of it place just like so this house was full of ladies and each

83
00:12:50,160 --> 00:13:02,000

well I don't know somewhere around

86
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,120
whoever lived here must have had a lot of strange hobbies you're so right

87
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,960
hey who said that wow look at that cog wheel the snork would love that I wonder what

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,760
one look at you and he won't even notice anything else well if he has any sense he will fall

90
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,000
for me like a ton of bricks you want about breakfast woman mama we'll have breakfast as soon as we

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,720
somebody without anything have some keys instead that at least comes from moving valley

99
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,040

113
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,760
owner of this house no oh indeed I am not most certainly not you are greatly mistaken this

114
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:07,920
is no house you fool this is a theater as the editor yes this is a stage where the heroine

115
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,200
receives a standing ovation at the end of the last act and the bread and the apples are props

116
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,840
and the rumor you are playing is where the actors make themselves up to become totally different

117
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:26,160
people kings or murderers oh and you are one of these actors actress you understand less than

118

beautifully my name is Emma Emma and you you better remember that this is a theater this is no

121
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,920
ordinary house and it is a great honor for you to be here at all that's true does this mean

122
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,040
that we can stay here just for a while you know until the actors return today they all think

123
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:09,520

125
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,180
oh yeah!

126
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,380
it reminds me of NASA, but it reminds me of, it reminds me of...

127
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,900
but it reminds me of a brainwarming scene in the sensual house

128
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,700
and it reminds me of a brain of a brainwarming scene in the sensual house

129
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,360
and it reminds me of a brainwarming scene

130
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,500
and it reminds me of a brain nerd

131
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,740
and it reminds me of a brainrü 떨어�ives

132
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,900
And it reminds you of a Mary projections

133
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,500
I remember this

134
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,080
when I first saw...

135
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,100
a cat who threw her shoes

136
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,700
under my shoes

137
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,700
and it reminds me of a brain [(Shortcutting their shoes by himself-)]

138
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,260
and it reminds me of...?

139
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,940
I remember Gabriel Peng and his brother

140
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,040
when I first saw him

141
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,320
when I first saw him

142
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,900
when I first saw him

143
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,900
That looks safe. We could easily spend the night here.

144
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,900
We'd better tie the theatre to the tree so it won't drift away if that's all right with Emma.

145
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,900
Emma, is it all right to tie the theatre to the tree?

146
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Do what you want, as long as you don't damage the theatre to here.

147
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,900
All right.

148
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Don't whistle you idiot. Don't ever whistle in a theatre.

149
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,900
That's the worst luck possible. How dare you?

150
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,900
Oh.

151
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,900
This is great snork maiden. We can look at the moon.

152
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,900
And the flowers, they smell so good.

153
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,900
What's the matter?

154
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,900
I hope that snorks all right?

155
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,900
Don't you worry. He was standing guard over a flying ship after all.

156
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,900
All you have to do is get on board and fly away.

157
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,900
What's going on here?

158
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,900
Huh?

159
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:49,900
No, they're trying to destroy the pamphor's box. I've never seen anything like it.

160
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,900
These people are bunch of vandals.

161
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:23,900
Meanwhile, movement and snork maiden are fast asleep, blissfully unaware of what was happening.

162
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,900
But whatever they do, stranded on the treetop.

163
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:37,900
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

164
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:45,900
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

165
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,900
They're always happy and goes at play.

166
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:56,900
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

167
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:06,900
The movements. The movements.
