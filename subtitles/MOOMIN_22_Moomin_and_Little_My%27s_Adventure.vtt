00:00.000 --> 00:21.120

00:38.640 --> 00:45.520

00:45.520 --> 00:57.920

bye bye bye bye

02:15.520 --> 02:26.360
About what is this it looks like movement as restless as if something has disturbed him I wonder what he was dreaming about

02:26.360 --> 02:41.880
I wonder what time it is oh it nearly 20 after 2

02:41.880 --> 02:45.880
I wonder whether it's morning or afternoon.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.880
It doesn't really matter, I suppose.

02:48.880 --> 02:49.880
Oh, it stopped.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.880
Oh, it's frozen.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.880
It looks really dark out there.

03:12.880 --> 03:17.880
Mama, Mama, please wake up.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.880
Papa, Papa.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.880
Mama, Mama.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.880
Mama, what's wrong with me? I feel way too weak.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.880
It's very odd. I don't usually wake up when I'm hibernating.

03:59.880 --> 04:04.880
Oh, dear. The whole house is buried in snow.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.880
Oh, no.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.880
Oh, no.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.880
Oh, Papa!

04:42.880 --> 04:44.880
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.880
This doesn't look like Moomin Valley.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.880
And it's so quiet.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.880
What was that?

05:17.880 --> 05:21.880
Perhaps I better go home.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.880
No, what's the matter with me?

05:23.880 --> 05:26.880
Everyone's asleep, and the furniture's all covered up,

05:26.880 --> 05:29.880
and Moomin's don't give up.

05:29.880 --> 05:34.880
Oh, I wish Northkin were here.

05:34.880 --> 05:39.880
He's probably in the far south where it's warm and sunny.

05:59.880 --> 06:04.880
I wonder what that is.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.880
Oh.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.880
That sounds like...

06:40.880 --> 06:43.880
Oh, yes, it's little Mai.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.880
By the bobble, what are you doing here, Moomin?

06:45.880 --> 06:47.880
What am I doing here?

06:47.880 --> 06:49.880
I heard strange noises and came to see what it was.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.880
Then you crashed into me like an avalanche,

06:51.880 --> 06:53.880
and I've just lifted the box off you.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.880
Oh, don't be stupid, Moomin.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.880
I mean, why are you out in the snow and not hibernating like the others?

06:58.880 --> 07:00.880
Spring's not for ages.

07:00.880 --> 07:04.880
Oh, I don't know. I just woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.880
But what about you, sliding about like that, you should be asleep too.

07:08.880 --> 07:10.880
Yes, I should, but I just woke up as well.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.880
Probably to look after you.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.880
I tried to wake my stupid sister, but she kept on snoring.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.880
But I think this snow is really great.

07:17.880 --> 07:21.880
Well, I don't. It's cold, it's slippy, much too bright,

07:21.880 --> 07:24.880
and it's everywhere and far too quiet.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.880
I saw the grok.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.880
Wow, that horrible freezing monster.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.880
She should feel at home in this, and there's no point in her trying to freeze anything.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.880
I saw her on the hill.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.880
Then it was her voice, I heard.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.880
Yes, and the trouble with the horror thing is that she's so cold,

07:40.880 --> 07:43.880
I wouldn't even want to touch her, Moomin.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.880
It's her!

07:46.880 --> 07:48.880
Oh!

07:54.880 --> 07:56.880
I'm getting cold shivers all over.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.880
Wow, why do you expect in the snow?

07:58.880 --> 08:00.880
No, it's the grok's fault. She's done it.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.880
Look at my skin, it's all goose bumpy.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.880
It's not like that in the summer, it's smooth, not lumpy.

08:06.880 --> 08:10.880
It's not the snow that makes me feel so cold, it's her staring at me.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.880
I'm scared.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.880
That was great.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.880
Good, isn't it?

08:21.880 --> 08:23.880
You can have as much as you like.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.880
We picked more raspberries than ever this year,

08:25.880 --> 08:27.880
and Mama made lots of juice.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.880
Thanks.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.880
Oh.

08:31.880 --> 08:32.880
Ah!

08:32.880 --> 08:34.880
I want that.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.880
Mama's silver tray?

08:36.880 --> 08:37.880
Yeah.

08:37.880 --> 08:38.880
What do you want it for?

08:38.880 --> 08:40.880
To slide on the snow with a coarse stupid.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.880
But it's a sort of family treasure and heirloom.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.880
Well, you never use it and it's so shiny.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.880
It'll make a great sled and go really fast.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.880
Doesn't look like they'll wake up till spring.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.880
They're lucky, they're still sleeping.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.880
I think it's very unfair that I woke up like this.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.880
So, what should we do now?

09:09.880 --> 09:11.880
I want to go look at the sea.

09:11.880 --> 09:12.880
Good idea.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.880
At least that won't be covered in snow.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.880
I bet the great cold was just like this.

09:35.880 --> 09:36.880
Oh no!

09:36.880 --> 09:37.880
What's the matter?

09:37.880 --> 09:38.880
I forgot the tray.

09:38.880 --> 09:39.880
Never mind.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.880
You couldn't use it as a boat anyway and it would sink.

09:42.880 --> 09:43.880
Yes, you could.

09:43.880 --> 09:44.880
What?

09:44.880 --> 09:45.880
How?

09:45.880 --> 09:46.880
Oh look!

09:46.880 --> 09:47.880
There's the sink!

09:52.880 --> 09:54.880
But it's all frozen.

09:54.880 --> 09:57.880
So we'll be able to slide on it.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.880
What's that over there?

10:10.880 --> 10:11.880
Huh?

10:28.880 --> 10:29.880
Huh?

10:29.880 --> 10:30.880
Doe ticky!

10:30.880 --> 10:32.880
Hello, you too.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.880
You're not hibernating, either?

10:36.880 --> 10:40.680
Oh, no. I haven't got time to spend four months sleeping.

10:40.680 --> 10:44.280
Why not? Little Mayan, I just woke up and now we don't know what to do.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.080
I'm sure you can think of something.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.480
You suppose so?

10:47.480 --> 10:50.280
I've never seen the sea frozen before.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.280
Did you make that horse too, Tiki?

10:52.280 --> 10:53.280
Yes, I did.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.280
Can I sit on it?

10:54.280 --> 10:57.680
No, you can't. I need it for the lady of the cold.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.280
Oh, I see.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.280
I suppose you've heard of her.

11:01.280 --> 11:05.480
Yes, she's very beautiful, but if she looks into your eyes, you're turned into a block of ice.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.280
She's not a very nice lady.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.480
That's right, Little Mayan.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.480
Spring can never come while she's here.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.080
It waits for her to go.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.080
Oh, I see.

11:13.080 --> 11:17.480
And are you hoping she'll ride away on this horse, then?

11:17.480 --> 11:23.680
Yes, and it will take her back to the north, where she stays until she comes here again next winter and drives the sun away.

11:23.680 --> 11:27.280
The horse doesn't look very solid to me, Tiki.

11:27.280 --> 11:33.280
Well, that's why I'm going to pour water over it when it gets really cold and then it'll be solid.

11:33.480 --> 11:35.480
When is the lady of the cold coming?

11:35.480 --> 11:41.480
You can never tell, but soon, tonight, perhaps, it feels much colder already.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.680
What's happened to the sun, Tiki?

11:59.680 --> 12:02.080
Do you know when the sun will come back again?

12:03.080 --> 12:09.880
It's in the south, shining on snuffkin, but it'll be back soon, and then it will stay a bit longer each day.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.080
Good, I can't wait.

12:11.080 --> 12:15.280
Now, there'll be a full moon tonight, and we'll be able to see everything.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.880
Great, I can get my tray up.

12:16.880 --> 12:18.880
I can't wait to try it on the sea.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.680
What do you mean, your tray?

12:20.680 --> 12:23.080
Well, let's move in, Mama's tray, but I'm using it.

12:23.080 --> 12:26.080
I'm going to put a sail on it and slide across the ice.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.480
Why not wait till tomorrow?

12:27.480 --> 12:28.680
Wait until tomorrow?

12:28.680 --> 12:29.480
No.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.680
When I want to do something, I do it now.

12:31.680 --> 12:34.680
What if the ice suddenly melts or something?

12:39.680 --> 12:40.680
I like it here.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.080
It's warm and cozy.

12:42.080 --> 12:45.280
I hope Mom and Papa doesn't mind me using it.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.280
This is Papa's bathhouse.

12:47.280 --> 12:51.280
He built it himself, and he'd be very glad to know you're using it.

12:51.280 --> 12:51.880
It's great.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.880
The window paints a different colors.

12:53.880 --> 12:58.680
If you look out through one, the world is red, and through another one, the world is green.

13:01.680 --> 13:13.280
Oh, you don't hibernate either, do you?

13:13.280 --> 13:17.280
Now scram, the horrible lady of the cold is coming and if she looks you in the eye, you'll

13:17.280 --> 13:18.280
turn to ice.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.280
Go on, go away.

13:31.680 --> 13:46.680
Moomin, two-tiggy, Moomin, Moomin, do-tiggy, where are you?

13:46.680 --> 13:50.680
Little Mike, we're over here, huh?

13:50.680 --> 13:52.680
What are you doing down there?

13:52.680 --> 13:55.680
Do-tiggy's trying to catch some fish.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.680
If she does, she's going to cook us some dinner.

13:58.680 --> 13:59.680
Right.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.480
I've got to get sailing, man.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.480
I'd better go see what she's doing to Mama Silver Trey.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.480
Okay.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.480
Ah, got one.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.480
Oh dear, me.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.480
It's cold and wet under that ice.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.480
How are you doing, Little Mike?

14:25.480 --> 14:26.480
Very well, thank you.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.480
How can you get under the ice anyway?

14:30.480 --> 14:33.480
I guess the water must be low and there's a gap left there.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.480
Oh, how?

14:34.480 --> 14:39.480
I don't know, but perhaps the tide was in when the sea froze and some of it got stuck to the shore.

14:39.480 --> 14:42.480
Oh, I suppose it's possible.

14:42.480 --> 14:47.480
Do-tiggy told me that she has fish soup every day in the wintertime.

14:50.480 --> 14:51.480
I know.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.480
I'll go see if the horse is frozen yet.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.480
Make sure you shut the door behind you.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.480
Oh, my thumb!

15:01.480 --> 15:03.480
I don't think it's hard enough yet.

15:03.480 --> 15:06.480
It'll collapse if the lady of the cold gets on it now.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.480
Oh, it's getting colder and colder.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.480
Oh, it's getting colder and colder.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.480
Oh, it's getting colder and colder.

15:41.480 --> 15:42.480
The grog.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.480
Don't tell me you want to ride the horse.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.480
I don't think you'd better.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.480
This is for the lady of the cold, you know.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.480
There's no telling what she'd do to you.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.480
Look you in the eye, probably.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.480
Even the grog is frightened of the lady of the cold.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.480
Ah, now it looks frozen.

16:27.480 --> 16:28.480
Wee!

16:30.480 --> 16:31.480
Yee-hee!

16:33.480 --> 16:34.480
Wee!

16:39.480 --> 16:41.480
Great, isn't it, movement?

16:41.480 --> 16:43.480
Yeah, that old tree really moves.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.480
Wanna go?

16:44.480 --> 16:46.480
No, thanks, I'm too big.

16:46.480 --> 16:50.480
Come on, now the fish soup is ready and it's time you were inside, little my.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.480
Keep it warm for me, I'm having another go.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.480
No, little my.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.480
Why not?

16:55.480 --> 16:58.480
Have you forgotten what I told you the lady of the cold may be coming?

16:58.480 --> 16:59.480
Oh.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.480
Well, I want to see her, I'm not scared of her.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.480
I'll be moving so fast she won't get a chance.

17:04.480 --> 17:07.480
No, now listen to me, little my.

17:07.480 --> 17:10.480
All you have to do is not let her look you in the eye.

17:10.480 --> 17:13.480
But what happens if you're not quick enough and she catches you before you turn away?

17:14.480 --> 17:18.480
I know, if we watch her from the bathhouse, she won't see us.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.480
Please, little my.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.480
Come in, she's almost here.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.480
We can watch it from inside.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.480
That's no good, I want to see her properly.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.480
No, little my.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.480
Don't go.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.480
Don't go.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.480
Come back, little my.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.480
Oh dear.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.480
Come on, let's get back in the cabin before it's too late.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.480
Wee!

17:52.480 --> 17:54.480
Mom, mom, mom.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.480
Oh, the lady of the cold.

18:22.480 --> 18:28.480
I saw her face, I saw her face.

18:28.480 --> 18:31.480
I saw her and she didn't turn away to eye.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.480
Press little my to get away with it.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.480
I don't know how she does it.

18:38.480 --> 18:41.480
I think her nerves are made of steel.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.480
I hope she's on her face.

18:43.480 --> 18:45.480
I saw her face, I saw her face.

18:45.480 --> 18:48.480
I saw her and she didn't turn away to eye.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.480
I think her nerves are made of steel.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.480
I hope she's alright.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.480
She should try not to make so much noise out there.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.480
Oh, oh.

19:27.480 --> 19:30.480
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

19:30.480 --> 19:32.480
Oh, oh, oh.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.480
Yeah, I know her face.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.480
I know her face.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.480
I know her face.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.480
I know her face.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.480
Oh, oh, oh.

20:02.480 --> 20:06.480
Come on, Mom, we, oh, now just out there.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.480
So wait a while.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.480
This is it.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.480
Little boy.

20:22.480 --> 20:29.480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

20:29.480 --> 20:36.480
Oh, oh, oh.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.480
Little my.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.480
Little my.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.480
Come on, please.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.480
Wake up, please.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.480
Oh, please, don't stay frozen, little my.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.480
Don't worry, little my.

21:23.480 --> 21:24.480
We'll thought you out.

21:24.480 --> 21:25.480
Don't worry.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.480
It's nice and warm here.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.480
Let's go.

21:41.480 --> 21:42.480
Ow!

21:42.480 --> 21:43.480
That's hot, moment.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.480
Praise the bull, Bob.

21:45.480 --> 21:46.480
You come back.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.480
So little my came back from the cold.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.480
Little the worse for where.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.480
The movement need not have worried.

21:56.480 --> 22:00.480
For the little mysers world are practically indestructible.

22:05.480 --> 22:12.480
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:12.480 --> 22:19.480
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:20.480 --> 22:24.480
They're always happy and always at play.

22:24.480 --> 22:27.480
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:27.480 --> 22:31.480
The movements.

22:31.480 --> 22:35.480
The movements.

22:35.480 --> 22:42.480
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:42.480 --> 22:48.480
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:49.480 --> 22:53.480
They're always happy and always at play.

22:53.480 --> 22:57.480
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:57.480 --> 23:00.480
The movements.

23:00.480 --> 23:04.480
The movements.

The movements.
