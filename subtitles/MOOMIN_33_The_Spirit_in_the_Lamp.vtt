WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.560

like a bird sing that song ever there were the moments there were the

00:44.640 --> 00:59.360
moments there were the moments there were the moments

01:05.840 --> 01:11.360
snort maiden was in a very good mood because that day she was off to collect

01:11.360 --> 01:14.920
shells of the seizure with me

01:23.320 --> 01:29.120
hey look the sun's up and there's Gracie

01:32.120 --> 01:40.480
oh rat what's the matter papa oh it's your moment what are you doing I heard you

01:40.480 --> 01:49.520
talking to yourself just now oh you see this I'm writing a play writing a

01:49.520 --> 01:54.280
play you remember the last children that was a very successful play just now I

01:54.280 --> 02:00.280
was repeating a line hey look another beautiful day and there goes Gracie it's a

02:00.280 --> 02:08.640
wonderful line of course don't you agree it could be improved I think about it

02:11.240 --> 02:13.720
haha

02:21.640 --> 02:25.520
look at this beautiful

02:27.320 --> 02:32.400
you know just usual like stuff

02:32.400 --> 02:42.400
Oh! There's another big one! Can't you really find anything, moment?

02:42.400 --> 02:49.400
I'll look somewhere else. I still think this is the best place!

02:49.400 --> 02:52.400
Well, I'm going over there!

02:52.400 --> 02:56.400
They're so beautiful!

02:56.400 --> 03:00.400
Oh!

03:01.400 --> 03:03.400
What are you doing, moment?

03:03.400 --> 03:05.400
No, that's no shell surely.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.400
No. So why did you dig it out?

03:07.400 --> 03:12.400
Well, once you see it, you want to find out what it is.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.400
A very odd thing, isn't it?

03:14.400 --> 03:17.400
Not very interesting.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.400
Oh no, I can see what it is.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.400
I gave it a good wash.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.400
I've seen one just like it in the fairy tales. It's an old clam.

03:28.400 --> 03:33.400
Yes, you remember the story called Aladdin? He rubbed the lamp and the genie appeared.

03:33.400 --> 03:37.400
The genie might appear for us if we do what Aladdin did.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.400
Don't be silly, Snork Maiden.

03:43.400 --> 03:47.400
But Snork Maiden, that was a fairy tale.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.400
Don't laugh! I just want to make absolutely sure.

03:50.400 --> 03:56.400
To tell you the truth, I've already tried it. My hands turned green. That's all that happened to me.

03:56.400 --> 04:01.400
Maybe you didn't do it the right way. You can't even whip cream properly.

04:01.400 --> 04:10.400
And I'm sure you have to say some magic words, such as apricot dapura, spirit, come forth, apricot dapura, try for all your words.

04:10.400 --> 04:16.400
You've chosen the wrong words. You should say, come out, say some of your something.

04:16.400 --> 04:21.400
Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness! Keep going, Snork Maiden!

04:27.400 --> 04:29.400
Oh!

04:33.400 --> 04:37.400
I am the spirit of the lamp. What is your command?

04:40.400 --> 04:43.400
Goodness, did you come out of this lamp?

04:43.400 --> 04:44.400
You got it.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.400
So you really are the spirit of this lamp?

04:47.400 --> 04:48.400
Always have been.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.400
But I have the book and you're not him.

04:51.400 --> 04:55.400
I can prove it if you're quite sure you want me to.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.400
By all means, it probably wasn't a good picture.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.400
I'm the one and only spirit of the lamp.

05:01.400 --> 05:06.400
Oh, then you must have the power to make any wish come true, is that so?

05:06.400 --> 05:08.400
Are we certainly but not yours?

05:08.400 --> 05:10.400
But I'm the one who'll dug you out.

05:10.400 --> 05:15.400
That's not so important, kid. She's the one who summoned me forth from the lamp.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.400
What are we going to do about this spirit?

05:17.400 --> 05:21.400
Why? Ask for something. Ask for something you've always wanted.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.400
Let's see. A pearl necklace.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.400
Sorry, may your wishes, my command.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.400
Hey, wait a minute.

05:30.400 --> 05:35.400
Oh, a pearl necklace is only one of the things I wanted I hadn't decided yet.

05:35.400 --> 05:39.400
Don't worry, Snork Maiden. I guess you can always send it back.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.400
If I like the necklace, then it's your turn to rub the lamp.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.400
Then you can wish for whatever you've always wanted.

05:44.400 --> 05:48.400
Yes. But where exactly did you rub the lamp?

05:48.400 --> 05:51.400
Right here and very, very slowly.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.400
All right, I'll say spirit come forth.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.400
It sounds a little better than come out spirit.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.400
One royal necklace, Miss.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.400
Thanks.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.400
This is incredible.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.400
Right, I do think this is exactly what I wanted.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.400
Oh, thank you ever so much.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.400
All in a day's wake. So pleased to oblige, Miss.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.400
Are you going back into the lamp?

06:31.400 --> 06:32.400
Yes, I am.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.400
I'm so happy. Now it's my turn to let you out of here.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.400
I'd like to have a wish granted too, please.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.400
Now, wait a minute.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.400
If getting in and out is a bother, why don't you let me give you my wish right now?

06:45.400 --> 06:48.400
You can't do it, young man. One at a time in the face to call.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.400
Just wanted to save time.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.400
Impossible, young say.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.400
But why?

06:53.400 --> 06:56.400
Because I am only able to fulfill one wish a week.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.400
I need my rest. It's hard work, you know.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.400
Oh, well, of course it's tiring.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.400
Perhaps I expected too much from you.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.400
Hold on. I wouldn't like you to think that I haven't got the power.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.400
I can do many extraordinary things.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.400
What kind of things?

07:11.400 --> 07:12.400
Not telling you.

07:15.400 --> 07:22.400
Listen, moment, we won't tell a soul about this lamp, all right?

07:22.400 --> 07:23.400
Of course not.

07:23.400 --> 07:47.400
No, names don't really matter.

07:47.400 --> 07:51.400
Tulip Hydrangea, who cares?

07:51.400 --> 07:53.400
No, that's not right somehow.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.400
Dranium Vox Glob.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.400
Oh, I'm so tired.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.400
Hmm.

08:25.400 --> 08:28.400
Praise the lad and I didn't tell them I can get out at night.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.400
I'd have no peace at all.

08:30.400 --> 08:33.400
My leisure time would be totally ruined by these two.

08:33.400 --> 08:37.400
Good thing also I can read their minds so I know what I'm up against.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.400
They're up to something I know they are.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.400
Oh, yes, dear me, dear me.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.400
No wonder the young man is worried to death.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.400
She wish I better rewrite this.

09:00.400 --> 09:05.400
Oh, Edgur Edgur, I do wish you was somebody else.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.400
This will certainly have to be changed.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.400
The whole page, really.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.400
What's going on here?

09:25.400 --> 09:28.400
Who did this?

09:28.400 --> 09:30.400
Mum, not you surely.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.400
What?

09:31.400 --> 09:34.400
And some rascals have been rewriting my play.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.400
Who could that possibly be?

09:35.400 --> 09:38.400
Who indeed in the middle of the night while I was asleep.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.400
It's very strange, isn't it, Papa?

09:40.400 --> 09:43.400
It can't be you, Mum, can it?

09:43.400 --> 09:45.400
Of course not, Papa.

09:45.400 --> 09:46.400
I am upset.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.400
Who can it be?

09:48.400 --> 09:51.400
Imagine going into your study while you were fast asleep.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.400
It's very rude, isn't it?

09:53.400 --> 09:56.400
I find it incredible that anyone could do such a thing.

09:56.400 --> 10:01.400
And all the rewriting was done on those bits that I knew weren't perfectly polished.

10:01.400 --> 10:05.400
Listen, dear, I'm sure they were far too good for him to improve on.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.400
No, no, you're wrong. That's the worst thing.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.400
I must admit he did improve them.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.400
Then I think you should feel pleased, dear.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.400
No, I'm not a bit pleased.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.400
The dramatist should write his own plays.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.400
Looks great, Snork Maiden.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.400
That is, if you like necklaces.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.400
Thank you, Little Mai. It was given to me as a present.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.400
Rather nice.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.400
Would you mind if I tried it on for a minute?

10:29.400 --> 10:32.400
Of course not. I'm sure you'll look gorgeous.

10:32.400 --> 10:36.400
I suppose in time one could get to like necklaces.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.400
I could ask for a similar one for you.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.400
Deepers, who's your rich friend?

10:42.400 --> 10:47.400
Yes, I searched the whole house, but I can't find it anywhere.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.400
Someone must have stolen it.

10:49.400 --> 10:54.400
Don't worry, Mrs. Philly-Johnk. I fully expect to arrest the thief any minute now.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.400
Good afternoon, Inspector.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.400
Hello, Snork Maiden.

10:57.400 --> 11:01.400
Please hurry, Inspector. The thief has almost certainly left Moomin Valley already.

11:01.400 --> 11:05.400
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Nothing is safe in this valley anymore.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.400
Now calm down, Mrs. Philly-Johnk.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.400
Did you just say you've had something stolen, Mrs. Philly-Johnk?

11:10.400 --> 11:14.400
My pearl necklace. Extraordinary beautiful pearls.

11:14.400 --> 11:18.400
87 of them. Looks just like the one you're wearing, Little Mai.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.400
You stole it.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.400
Did you?

11:23.400 --> 11:25.400
Oh, oh, no!

11:25.400 --> 11:26.400
What are you doing?

11:26.400 --> 11:27.400
What are you doing?

11:27.400 --> 11:28.400
Stop!

11:28.400 --> 11:29.400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.400
Rest your heart.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.400
Prove the river she's a baby. She's innocent.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.400
Little via the ocean.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.400
The smallest cruxer up in the most funny adventure.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.400
This is Snork Maiden's necklace, you know.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.400
Oh, that's very funny.

11:43.400 --> 11:46.400
Is that the best explanation you can think of?

11:46.400 --> 11:49.400
No one calls Little Mai a thief and gets away with it.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.400
Is it really true that this is your necklace, Snork Maiden?

11:52.400 --> 11:55.400
Of course, Inspector. It was a present. I swear it.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.400
Who gave it to you?

11:57.400 --> 11:59.400
That's a secret between me and Moomin.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.400
A secret?

12:00.400 --> 12:03.400
That's a lie. They stole it, Inspector.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.400
I've never known them to lie before, Mrs. Philly-Johnk.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.400
You're back from a very bad background.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.400
You should see their home.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.400
So right!

12:10.400 --> 12:11.400
No, I see it.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.400
Stop it, Little Mai!

12:13.400 --> 12:15.400
Bad background and you talk to them.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.400
There you say that.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.400
No, there's something I want to ask you.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.400
Little Mai, what are you doing?

12:20.400 --> 12:21.400
No!

12:21.400 --> 12:23.400
The boy has to be a pain, you know.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.400
This is it.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.400
I love to know who did this.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.400
He's certainly got an act with words.

12:43.400 --> 12:44.400
Huh?

12:44.400 --> 12:47.400
Listen to this. This is a good example.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.400
Hey, look at the sky. The sun's up and there's Gracie.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.400
That's not great. Sounds very ordinary.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.400
That's what I wrote, Snorkin.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.400
Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.400
That's all right. Now listen to how he rewrote it.

13:02.400 --> 13:06.400
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?

13:06.400 --> 13:09.400
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.400
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon

13:12.400 --> 13:15.400
who is already sick and pale with grief.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.400
What a sunrise!

13:17.400 --> 13:22.400
And note how clever this writer is to change her name from Gracie to Juliet.

13:22.400 --> 13:26.400
Gracie's worried because her parents don't approve of her love Edgar.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.400
I had his names don't matter.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.400
Tulip, I'd rangers who cares.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.400
But listen to this.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.400
What's in a name?

13:33.400 --> 13:37.400
That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.400
It's much more romantic.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.400
I got it.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.400
So Romeo would.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.400
Well, he not Romeo called.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.400
Oh, it's simply great.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.400
Except maybe I wouldn't have mentioned his smell.

13:47.400 --> 13:51.400
Don't you agree? He's an excellent playwright.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.400
Yes, I agree.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.400
He sounds like a very promising playwright.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.400
And then wordy perhaps, but really good.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.400
Very good indeed.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.400
Write him a note asking him to carry on.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.400
And there might not be necessary.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.400
You know, all the changes were made in the middle of the night

14:06.400 --> 14:07.400
while I was fast asleep.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.400
And usually writers are in their beds,

14:09.400 --> 14:12.400
none of their desks when they're asleep.

14:12.400 --> 14:16.400
Well, yes, that's the only time you're not at your desk, isn't it?

14:16.400 --> 14:19.400
But there are people you know who walk about at night

14:19.400 --> 14:22.400
without remembering about it the next morning.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.400
Sleepwalkers, you mean?

14:24.400 --> 14:25.400
Now I come to think of it.

14:25.400 --> 14:28.400
You were rather sleepy when you woke up this morning.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.400
You're right, Mum and Mama, even sleepier than usual.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.400
Just so.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.400
You mean you yourself got up at night

14:34.400 --> 14:37.400
and then went and rewrote the play and you're asleep?

14:37.400 --> 14:39.400
Well, yes.

14:39.400 --> 14:43.400
I have been worried about some minor things in my play.

14:43.400 --> 14:47.400
So my subconsciousness, fairly rich and literary talent,

14:47.400 --> 14:49.400
as we all know, comes to the rescue.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.400
A moment, Papa.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.400
And in my sleep, my imagination runs riot.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.400
I have all sorts of good ideas that make me grab a pen

14:56.400 --> 14:59.400
in the middle of the night and rush to my room

14:59.400 --> 15:01.400
to let the real skill throw.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.400
I got it!

15:04.400 --> 15:05.400
I got it!

15:05.400 --> 15:06.400
I got it!

15:06.400 --> 15:08.400
With this I can have anything!

15:08.400 --> 15:10.400
I can do anything!

15:10.400 --> 15:11.400
Stop!

15:11.400 --> 15:12.400
Stop!

15:12.400 --> 15:14.400
When I say stop, you have to stop!

15:14.400 --> 15:16.400
The inspector!

15:16.400 --> 15:19.400
How can you put on the already?

15:20.400 --> 15:22.400
And we've arrived when you want to get lost!

15:22.400 --> 15:24.400
Get lost yourself!

15:24.400 --> 15:25.400
I don't have time for you!

15:25.400 --> 15:27.400
The inspector's chasing me!

15:27.400 --> 15:28.400
What?

15:28.400 --> 15:29.400
You?

15:29.400 --> 15:30.400
Stop, little boy!

15:30.400 --> 15:31.400
I'm the inspector!

15:31.400 --> 15:32.400
You have to stop when I say so!

15:32.400 --> 15:34.400
He's not chasing me, huh?

15:34.400 --> 15:35.400
Don't deny it!

15:35.400 --> 15:36.400
I know why you're running!

15:36.400 --> 15:37.400
You stole that thing, didn't you?

15:37.400 --> 15:39.400
I know it, too!

15:39.400 --> 15:41.400
That's gonna be your business!

15:41.400 --> 15:42.400
It's not yours!

15:42.400 --> 15:44.400
But it must be somebody!

15:44.400 --> 15:46.400
So I'm making my business in it to me!

15:47.400 --> 15:48.400
Oh, is that me?

15:48.400 --> 15:49.400
Please!

15:49.400 --> 15:50.400
Stop loosening everything!

15:50.400 --> 15:52.400
Give it back to me!

15:52.400 --> 15:55.400
Hey, that looks like the lamp we found!

15:57.400 --> 15:58.400
Chase him!

15:58.400 --> 15:59.400
It's better not be!

15:59.400 --> 16:00.400
Hello!

16:01.400 --> 16:02.400
Oh, man!

16:02.400 --> 16:04.400
Stinky's got our magic lamp!

16:04.400 --> 16:05.400
Let after him!

16:05.400 --> 16:06.400
Yes!

16:06.400 --> 16:07.400
We can't let him get away with it!

16:07.400 --> 16:08.400
Or terrible!

16:08.400 --> 16:09.400
Please let it happen!

16:09.400 --> 16:10.400
Did you hear that?

16:10.400 --> 16:11.400
That's enough here, no!

16:11.400 --> 16:13.400
He said magic lamp or something!

16:13.400 --> 16:15.400
After him!

16:15.400 --> 16:17.400
The magic lamp is mine!

16:17.400 --> 16:18.400
Just leave me alone!

16:18.400 --> 16:20.400
Where are you going, Stinky?

16:20.400 --> 16:21.400
Help me get the necklace!

16:21.400 --> 16:23.400
No, no, no, no!

16:23.400 --> 16:24.400
This way!

16:24.400 --> 16:25.400
He's got me!

16:25.400 --> 16:26.400
Oh!

16:26.400 --> 16:27.400
Get him!

16:27.400 --> 16:28.400
Get him!

16:28.400 --> 16:29.400
He's got me!

16:29.400 --> 16:30.400
Oh, man!

16:30.400 --> 16:31.400
Get him!

16:31.400 --> 16:32.400
Get him, man!

16:32.400 --> 16:33.400
Give him!

16:33.400 --> 16:34.400
Oh!

16:34.400 --> 16:35.400
Oh, my dear!

16:35.400 --> 16:36.400
He's coming!

16:36.400 --> 16:37.400
He's coming!

16:43.400 --> 16:44.400
Oh!

16:45.400 --> 16:47.400
You're the spirit of the lamp, aren't you?

16:47.400 --> 16:48.400
Yes, my master.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.400
What is your wish?

16:50.400 --> 16:51.400
You his master?

16:51.400 --> 16:52.400
Yes, me!

16:52.400 --> 16:54.400
I'm the master.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.400
I let him out, so he'll do what I say.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.400
I don't believe a word of this.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.400
Fairy tales aren't true.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.400
Maybe it isn't true, but it works.

17:02.400 --> 17:05.400
I saw Snorkmaiden wishing for a pearl necklace

17:05.400 --> 17:07.400
and her wish was granted.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.400
Uh-huh.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.400
So you're responsible.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.400
Yeah, and I brought it right away.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.400
God, now let me see.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.400
What do I want more than anything in the world?

17:18.400 --> 17:21.400
Stinky, he can only make one wish a week come true.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.400
You'll have to wait your turn.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.400
No, that's very unfair.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.400
Let's get back to the necklace.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.400
Where did you steal it from, mister?

17:29.400 --> 17:30.400
I don't steal.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.400
Well, then tell me where you found it.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.400
Around here somewhere.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.400
Mrs. Philly John's house, baby.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.400
I don't know who lives there.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.400
Oh, then you did steal the necklace.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.400
Well, that's a lot easier, you know.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.400
How about a magic key that can open anything,

17:45.400 --> 17:47.400
bolts and safes and stuff, huh?

17:47.400 --> 17:50.400
Listen, there's something I'd like to ask you.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.400
A sack of gold wouldn't be half as much fun

17:52.400 --> 17:54.400
as a key that opens anything.

17:54.400 --> 17:58.400
Tell me, is it possible that you rewrote women poppers play?

17:58.400 --> 18:00.400
Yes, I did. It was really awful.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.400
Oh, come on, now I just needed some polishing.

18:03.400 --> 18:06.400
And what's more, see this young man standing here?

18:06.400 --> 18:09.400
Well, he was really worried about your play, you know?

18:09.400 --> 18:11.400
I was just trying to help.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.400
Is this true?

18:12.400 --> 18:15.400
Yeah, safer than mercury, of course.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.400
But then there's professional pride to think of.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.400
I can explain, Papa.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.400
I saw you weren't happy about your play

18:22.400 --> 18:24.400
and I wanted it to be a big success.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.400
Of course, I didn't want the spirit to write it himself.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.400
I'm going to take the key, yeah!

18:30.400 --> 18:32.400
I've just realized, everybody,

18:32.400 --> 18:34.400
the spirit didn't write all that himself.

18:34.400 --> 18:35.400
I've heard it before.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.400
I thought it sounded familiar.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.400
Is that so?

18:39.400 --> 18:42.400
Yes, he stole it from a play by somebody else.

18:42.400 --> 18:45.400
This spirit is a cheat and a liar.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.400
Oh, dear me.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.400
Well, I can't help being so well read.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.400
Can I go back in the lamp now?

18:51.400 --> 18:53.400
No! Wait! Don't go yet!

18:53.400 --> 18:55.400
I want next week's list now!

18:55.400 --> 18:57.400
Sorry, Mastic Interblind.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.400
Have them put into an impossible situation.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.400
See you next week!

19:04.400 --> 19:06.400
But that's ridiculous!

19:06.400 --> 19:09.400
Not next week, nor next month, or even next year.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.400
Stinky, this lamp is not yours.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.400
Besides, I know exactly the sort of thing you'd ask for.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.400
A master key or something.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.400
You think you can hide that magic lamp from me, do you?

19:20.400 --> 19:23.400
Well, there's no hiding place good enough for that.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.400
Hmm.

19:25.400 --> 19:30.400
Well, then I really do think that lamp is a bit too dangerous to have a rod.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.400
Hmm. I think you're right.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.400
Snuff candy, you have any good ideas for us?

19:35.400 --> 19:37.400
Yes, for us.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.400
Hmm. The week has passed, so we can summon the spirit again.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.400
There's the inspector!

20:06.400 --> 20:09.400
You do it, Snuffkin!

20:09.400 --> 20:11.400
Call the spirit!

20:19.400 --> 20:22.400
Oh, no, not again. What do you want this time?

20:22.400 --> 20:24.400
Can you bring the hobgoblin here?

20:24.400 --> 20:28.400
I suppose so. I'll be back as soon as I can.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.400
But why on earth do you want the hobgoblin?

20:39.400 --> 20:44.400
As far as I can see, there's only one safe place for the lamp where no one can find it.

20:44.400 --> 20:49.400
And that's on another planet, and the only one who can put it there is the hobgoblin.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.400
He's coming any minute.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.400
Geez, that guy ever hard to find.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.400
Thank you. I've done my wake for this week.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.400
See you next week. Goodbye!

21:05.400 --> 21:23.400
And some of the hobgoblin took the magic ramp away and hid it on some unknown planet.

21:23.400 --> 21:30.400
And a good thing too, it would really be very boring if all your wishes were granted, wouldn't it?

21:31.400 --> 21:40.400
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

21:40.400 --> 21:47.400
We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

21:47.400 --> 21:51.400
They're always happy and goes at play.

21:51.400 --> 21:58.400
The Moons are having fun day after day. The Moons.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.400
The Moons.

22:02.400 --> 22:09.400
The Moons.
