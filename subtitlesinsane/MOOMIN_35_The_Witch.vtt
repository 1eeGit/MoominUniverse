    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Therefore you are your TV.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They are the movements.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, what do you think?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I think it's a good idea. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
sing the best song ever, there were the movements, there was the movement,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There was the movement, there was the movement,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:33.379
There was the movement, there was the movement, These days, women and snuffkin were together even more than ever. Winter would hit the Moon Valley any day now, and then they would have to part.

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:38.620
Moon had to go into hibernation and snuff into the forest for himself.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.620
Huh?

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.620
Little one.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.000
You look sad, for something upset you?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Where are you off to, Moomin?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
To the lonely mountains.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
How come you two are always stealing off somewhere?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
We're not stealing off. We're just going for a walk to lonely mountains.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Just the two of you? You're even worse than usual, never taking any of us with you.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I hadn't noticed are we really doing that?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm not sure maybe we are.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
No, maybe's about it and let me tell you it's very rude.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
But we were just off for a walk.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I know.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Well then, why are you going?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It'll start snowing any day now little mite

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and then we won't be able to go anywhere will we?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We wanted a last look at moving valley from above

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
before that happens.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.599
A likely story. But it's true, I'm off very soon and I wanted to see it all to give me a picture to remember

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.639
while I'm walking.

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.479
Hmm. Did you hear that, Snarkman? Sniff, come here!

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:42.240
Blow in, do you mind if we come along with you? Of course not.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.360
You see, we thought you were probably plotting something secret

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.360
and weren't letting any of us in on it.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.080
Oh, come on, we don't have any secrets from you.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.159
It's just that, well, you know what I mean.

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.120
Snuff can be leaving for months and months very soon.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.039
Never mind off we go.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.319
It would be fun to see it all from here in the middle of winter all white. Must be very beautiful.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.719
Oh, I don't think so.

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.599
With everything white and clean.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.759
In summer, it's very beautiful.

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:20.520
Well, I'm coming back here in winter to see it for myself.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.599
You can't do that, you're hibernating.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.159
Well, maybe not.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.000
I thought that this year I'd tried to keep awake all winter.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
You mean just like Moomin and I did last year?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Yes!

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
You could never do it.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
What about you? Are you hibernating?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I'm not all that mad about the snow and the cold and darks all hibernate.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I'm very happy to be going home. I've seen it all now.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Well, we didn't ask you to come along a little like.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Why don't we go take a look at that beautiful lake against sniff,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
the one with the golden fish?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Oh, no, that's too far away.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Ah, you're just afraid of the forest of witches, aren't you, Sniff?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Not at all, I'm not a bit scared.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Hey, look! Who's that?

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:12.379
Nobody, I know wonder what she's doing here sitting down don't say such silly things sniff

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.519
Hello there

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.000
What are you doing up there? Hello there! What are you doing up there?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I'm waiting!

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
For what?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
For grandma?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Out here all alone.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.160
Well grandma told me there was a big rock by the path leading up to Lonely Mountains

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.439
into wait there.

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:39.439
But there are other rocks by the path you know?

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:43.240
Oh are there?

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.000
But this is the only one I've seen so far.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Your grandma must be crazy or something

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
making you wait in a place like this.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
No, our house is in the forest and she's coming to show me the way.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
In the forest?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
You mean the forest of witches?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Yes, I suppose so. It's not very far from here.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
That's it, definitely.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
How long have you been waiting here?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Oh, about an hour.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.800
One hour?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.360
She's not very punctual.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.199
Perhaps I was early.

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.000
Yes, she was an hour early.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.600
Oh, it's grandma.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.600
Welcome, Alicia.

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:28.000
Where do you find all these children, my dear? I was waiting here all alone and then they came along the path and wanted to help.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Very kind of you, I'm sure. Well don't just stand there, my dear. Let's go!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Come along!

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Excuse me, excuse me, ma'am, but don't you live in the forest?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And did I do? Excuse me, excuse me, ma'am, but don't you live in the forest?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And did I do?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
In what part of it?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Let me see, it must be about right in the middle.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Interesting.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
The only place I know of is an old house where they say,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
which is used to live.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
You don't say, young man.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Well, what do you know?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:17.000
What will you think of next?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Her grandmother is... A witch, I think?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But surely, they don't exist.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.480
Of course not, like dragons don't exist.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.439
Well, she doesn't seem like a nasty one.

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:32.240
How can you tell, Moments?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.959
I don't think that nice girl would have a bad one for a grandma.

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:38.720
Perhaps not.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.279
So tell me what makes you think she's a witch, eh?

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:44.560
Who else could live in that forest, Papa?

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.360
I don't know. I can can think of anyone right now,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.160
but some people would like it.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.000
Yes, I suppose you're right.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.279
I hope you are.

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:53.720
I've lived in Moomin Valley for a long time,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.160
and I've never once seen a witch.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.399
So they don't exist?

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.680
Yeah.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.279
Oh, stop working now, Snork.

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:05.000
Dinner's ready.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I'm coming.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
No wonder it's so light. Look, the moon is up.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Snork, Maiden. I think it would be very wise for you to stay with the movements from tonight on.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Why on earth do you think that, Snork?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I've decided not to hibernate this winter.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.120
Why ever not? Leon Earth, do you think that's Norck? I've decided not to hibernate this winter.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.279
Why ever not?

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.160
I want to complete the blueprint for my new flying ship

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.040
by next spring.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.040
For a real inventor, sleep is an unnecessary luxury.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.759
Science, my dear Snork Maiden, will not wait

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:39.759
while inventors take a nap.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:42.439
But you know, dear Snork, how dependent you are

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:43.600
in your sleep.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600
I'll stay awake.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.600
Very well, then.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.480
This winter, I will hibernate with the movements.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.839
Excellent.

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:51.240
Shall we have dinner?

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.319
I'm ready now.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.160
Well, certainly snorks.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.000
Snork maiden will be just fine here with us.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Thank you.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
This is nice for Moomin too. Now he'll have Snork Maiden to keep him company.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Yes.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
But who needs company when they're hibernating after all Noomin will be fast asleep?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Never the less. Sleeping is much nicer when someone else sleeps in the same room.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.360
When do we start hibernating, do you think?

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.399
With weather like this in another few days, I guess.

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:29.839
So early?

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:31.680
We'll have snow before the week is out.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.919
Well, good luck with your new blueprint, Snork.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:37.120
I look forward to seeing your flying ship in the spring.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.960
Hmm, come this time next year, I'll definitely be flying about.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Thanks again for taking Snork, Maiden. That's not trouble at all. Good night then. Good night snork. See you snorkmaiden. Good luck this winter snork. Thank goodness at last I can really concentrate on my work.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Ah?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I don't believe this!

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Am I hallucinating?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Oh, no!

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Oh!

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Oh, which I'm sure it was. I'm positive. I'm a broomstick. When the snorke gets an idea in his head, it's not much room for anyone or anything else, is there?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I hope you'll succeed this time.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
At least in my dream that rounding really flew well.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I often dream that I fly, but I wouldn't dream of trying it out.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Snook must have had some sort of a new idea.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Oh!

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
It's snorke!

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
What's the matter?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Oh, that's my piece of cake. You look like you've seen a ghost.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Not a ghost. She laughed at me.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Who did? She was flying on a broom.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
No engine at all.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Are you talking about the witch?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
What's the use? There's no point if you can do it so easily.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Hurry up and get yourself together. You really so are? Yes. Are you talking about the witch? What's the use? There's no point if you can do it so easily.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Hurry up and get yourself together.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
You really so are?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Yes.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
But where?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Right near here.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I can't see any witch up there, Snork.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Just the moon up in the sky!

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And she was really flying in the sky? Is that what Snork said?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Well, he should know about things that fly.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Hmm. But I just can't believe it until I've seen it myself.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.360
If she really is a witch, then what about the girl?

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.639
I mean, no one could be happy living with a witch.

00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:32.519
I really don't know. I thought witches had to be old.

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:36.120
Maybe it's not her real grandmother. She could be adopted.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.960
Well, Mumin, we must get to the bottom of this.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.960
Yes, Nufkin. We must.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.960
Hmm.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.960
Ah.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.440
Hmm.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.500
Hmm. Hmm. We must.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.500
Ha, I caught you at it again, you and your secret plan.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Where are you going? Today you can't come with us with a little fly.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And why not?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Because we're going on a dangerous mission.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
We're going to the forest of witches.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.879
Well, if you're in any danger, then I must certainly come along to look after you,

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:07.399
Moon, and come on.

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:11.399
Besides, nothing's exciting to happen to me

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:25.000
since I went up with that kite. This is what we'll do. I grabbed the witch and while she's helpless, you two grabbed the girl and whisk her away to safety.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:33.000
That sounds great, but we don't know if she is a witch little my. If we grab her and she isn't a witch, it would be embarrassing and we could all be in trouble.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Maybe the witch needed an innocent maiden to try out some potions to experiment on her.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Maybe, let's find out.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
How do we find out?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
By snooping around, I suppose.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.879
I hope you'll think of something a bit better than that before we get there.

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:52.440
Let's hide as close to the house as we can and then ask the girl as soon as she comes

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.720
out.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.320
And what if she doesn't come out, Snuffkin?

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.120
Then we'll improvise a little more.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.480
So this is the famous plan by the great Snuffkin.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.000
Look, if she doesn't come out of the house,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
we'll just go up a knock on the door.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Once we're inside, I'm sure we'll be able to tell what's really what.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I don't think it's a very good idea.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
What if she catches us balance?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Little Mime will wait outside,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and if we don't come out, she can run back to Moomin Valley for help.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.799
That's fine, but Moomin can wait outside and all search the house.

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:29.600
Oh no, little Mai, you can wait outside and I will search the house.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.799
Let's do it this way.

00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:34.100
You stay outside and if we get caught, try to free us.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.519
And run for help as quickly as you can only if you can't.

00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:38.519
Is that okay?

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:42.759
Hmm, that means if you're in trouble, your lives will be in my hands.

00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:43.759
That's right, little Mai.

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:45.600
I don't like the sound of this.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.200
I'm not sure I want little my to be my last hope.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.500
Well, I wouldn't now, but anyone who doesn't trust me, that's for sure.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.500
Here's that, see what I mean?

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.500
Shh! Be quiet!

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.500
There's a house!

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.000
Look at this. It's very quiet. Do you think there's anybody home?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I don't know. Let's wait a while and see.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Do we have to stay absolutely still?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
But of course we do. We'll feel extremely silly if the house is empty.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
They disappeared. They could have told us where they were going.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I'm sure I don't care. Little Mywin too I think.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
She's betraying us. That's just like her.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Don't worry. I've got a pretty good idea where they were heading for.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
You know where they've gone? Why didn't you tell me? Where are they?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
They've gone to the forest of witches.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
What?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
They've gone to see whether the woman we met yesterday is a real witch.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
A real one?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.580
Why don't we go there too? I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find my way, Sniff.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.159
Uh...uh...

00:14:51.159 --> 00:14:52.159
What is it?

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:54.960
I don't know, it's my stomach. I better lie down.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.759
Oh, it's very painful.

00:14:58.759 --> 00:14:59.759
Oh...

00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:04.159
Oh, how much longer we can have to stay here like this.

00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:07.000
This adventure isn't the least bit exciting.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Well, let's wait a little bit longer. Be quiet. At least we know the girl is definitely in there.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
No, we don't. She might be out. She could be anywhere.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
I know that's possible, but I don't think so.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
She's getting some water.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
As I thought, that way she's working hard to the bone. Hey. She's getting some water.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
As I thought, that bitch is working her to the bone.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Hey, little boy!

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
She's following that girl!

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
You go with her, Moomin, and find out as much as you possibly can about what's going on.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I'll watch the house.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Right.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Hey, wait for me! Oh I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. If you're looking for Alicia, she's out.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Oh, no!

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.500
Listen, wait and see. I wasn't doing anything wrong!

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.500
Why did you try to run away then?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.500
Oh! I'll help you with that!

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.500
So will I!

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.000
How kind of you! It is a bit heavy to carry, you know!

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.500
I think I remember your name! Is it Alicia?

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.039
Yes it is! I'm so glad you Is it Alicia? Yes, it is.

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:26.960
I'm so glad you remembered it.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.400
My name is Lumin.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.240
And I'm Lumin.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.640
What are you doing here in the forest of witches?

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.200
Well, to be perfectly honest,

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.920
we came because we were rather worried about you.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.920
What about me?

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.920
Why is that?

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.319
Is that a woman really your grandmother?

00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:42.319
Of course.

00:17:42.319 --> 00:17:43.079
You're quite sure?

00:17:43.079 --> 00:17:44.240
Yes, of course.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.519
She's my mother's mother.

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:51.920
Why do you ask? Well, don't you know? He's trying to ask. That's cool. Maybe your grandmother

00:17:51.920 --> 00:18:00.079
is a witch. Yes, she is. Of course. Oh, I'm sorry. I was a bit taken aback. You don't

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:08.839
mind about your grandmother being a real witch? Oh, no! That's what she is! I was husband! I'm going to be one too when I'm grown up!

00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:10.640
Oh no! You couldn't!

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.880
Well, you don't look anything like one!

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.039
Well, that's because I'm not one yet!

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:19.559
When you're born into a witch family, that's what you become, but it's not that easy, you know?

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:21.559
Oh, this is too much!

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:26.039
Now, tell me, what are you doing here in the forest of witches?

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:27.839
You don't sound like a witch.

00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:28.759
Oh, really?

00:18:28.759 --> 00:18:30.359
What do witches sound like?

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:33.720
Well, to be honest, you're the first one I've ever met in my whole life.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.519
I'm sure that's just what you think, young man.

00:18:36.519 --> 00:18:39.559
Is it true that the nice girl is really your granddaughter?

00:18:39.559 --> 00:18:40.759
Certainly.

00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:42.640
A very promising young girl.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.000
Honest and hardworking, and with a lot of training,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
she will make an excellent witch someday.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
But how can you possibly turn such a sweet girl into a witch?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
The sweetest girls make the best witches.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Hello, didn't know you were back, grandma.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Thank you for getting the water, Alicia.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Oh, who's that?

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
I don't know.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Some naive young man ought to rescue a damsel

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
and distress no now.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.299
I remember you, your snuffkin.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.200
Yes.

00:19:10.099 --> 00:19:13.000
Your friend snuffkins in here, why don't you come in too?

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.099
In the house?

00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:15.099
Really?

00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:17.000
He's brought friends with him, Addy.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.500
Sofkin, whatever they don't do you.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.400
I'll take care of that.

00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:24.700
Wait a second, I'll do it for you.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.000
I'll take care of that. Wait a second. I'll do it for you. I'll fix it.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
I'm here!

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Wait. I'm gonna need you again.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Where are you going?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
I don't think that snake ever got bitten before.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
I'll get another.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I'm very curious. Why are you three here?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
They came all the way from Moomin Valley

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.440
because they were really worried about me, Grandma.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.640
Weren't about you?

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.839
Yes, they thought you might be nasty to me, so they came all this way to see if I needed help.

00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:56.400
This always happens.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.039
People treat witches as if they weren't ordinary, respectable, responsible citizens.

00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:03.200
No, no, we're very sorry.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.519
We realize.

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:06.440
She's quite okay and she's most welcome

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:11.599
to visit us in Moomin Valley at any time, isn't she, Snuffkin? Yes, certainly.

00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:17.480
What? You said you'd visit these people? Oh, yes. I thought I'd go over there sometimes

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:22.279
after I finished with my homework, of course. I would never leave my studies half done.

00:20:22.279 --> 00:20:25.960
Sorry, Alicia, but if you ever want to become a good witch,

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.759
you mustn't see any ordinary mortals.

00:20:28.759 --> 00:20:30.119
Oh, why not?

00:20:30.119 --> 00:20:33.559
I've only just become friends with them, Grandma, please.

00:20:33.559 --> 00:20:34.480
I know.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.160
Why don't I wait a year and study to be a witch next year?

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.000
Alicia.

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:44.039
This is family business.

00:20:44.039 --> 00:20:47.000
So if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you were to leave.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
I'd like you to go immediately if you please.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.000
It's snowing! Well, she certainly won't be able to visit us at Moomin Valley is buried in snow, so we

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
might never see her again.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
No, that's right, and you'll be leaving soon, won't you, Snuffkin?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Winter had come once again to Moomin Valley. Yeah. Leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
They're always happy and goes at play

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
The moments are having fun day after day, the movements

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:07.000
The movements, the movements The Moons
