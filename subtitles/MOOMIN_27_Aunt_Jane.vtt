It's your father's old girlfriend, of course never. Oh, I'm sure he had dozens and dozens

02:03.600 --> 02:07.800
Moomin Papa was a very kind and handsome young man a voice from the past

02:09.280 --> 02:11.280
Moomin Papa liquid. I've got for you

02:15.840 --> 02:18.340
Oh, no, I was

02:19.100 --> 02:25.620
Moomin Mama, I think you should go back to the kitchen. Whatever for a little

02:25.620 --> 02:31.980
My because Moomin Papa's stormy youth is catching up with him. Please Papa tell us it's not that kind of letter

02:37.380 --> 02:41.780
Whatever it was it was a long time ago long before I ever met you

02:42.180 --> 02:44.180
No, it's not that kind of letter

02:45.180 --> 02:51.540
What sort of letter is it then? Oh much worse. It's from Aunt Jane. Who's that?

02:52.020 --> 02:58.820
Mine my dear is on my father's side. Oh, how boring. You look very pale suddenly dear

02:59.460 --> 03:07.060
Yes, because she's coming for a visit tomorrow. Oh, don't worry. There's plenty of time for arranging a welcome party

03:07.700 --> 03:11.460
But I don't like her and I don't want it to come for a visit

03:11.540 --> 03:16.660
Moomin Papa, why not? Well, you'll soon see she's very rich very rich

03:17.620 --> 03:25.220
Yes, and she bosses everyone and we won't have a moment of peace. Oh, maybe she's so rich. She'll give us all wonderful presents

03:25.620 --> 03:30.420
Goodness, this is so unexpected. Why is she coming here all of a sudden? Oh

03:31.300 --> 03:36.580
She says she wants to discuss money matter as good heavens with me. She says there's no one else

03:36.820 --> 03:41.060
So you see I'm in a very difficult situation. Oh, why can't you tell if you're not an expert

03:42.100 --> 03:48.100
You don't tell Aunt Jane things. She tells you when that's that is not explained when you meet her

03:48.180 --> 03:50.180
You'll know exactly what I mean

03:50.420 --> 03:55.380
What do I know about money matters nothing? Not surprising since we've never had any

03:55.940 --> 04:02.580
How can she expect a poor creature like you to know anything about money? Also, she's very very suspicious

04:03.140 --> 04:05.140
And she says money is a terrible burden

04:05.780 --> 04:08.260
Oh, I wouldn't mind shouldering her burden

04:08.900 --> 04:13.700
Maybe you'll inherit it, and then we could share the money and have a wonderful time together

04:14.340 --> 04:16.340
Hey

04:34.260 --> 04:37.460
This time I almost did it

04:44.580 --> 04:46.580
So

04:47.060 --> 04:51.220
Moving Papa has a rich and very interesting

04:52.500 --> 04:56.900
Yes, she's got so much money. She doesn't know what to do with it all. Oh

04:57.700 --> 05:04.180
So snorke, why don't you ask her to invest in your flying ship? You'll need money to rebuild won't you?

05:04.500 --> 05:10.340
It would be a great investment for her. It certainly would be. I'm sure she jump at it. Hmm

05:11.060 --> 05:13.060
There'd be no harm in asking, I guess

05:13.140 --> 05:15.140
Oh

05:35.300 --> 05:38.900
What's the matter, Mr. Hemiellen? You look so unhappy

05:39.700 --> 05:42.340
I'm stuck that's my problem. How's that?

05:43.540 --> 05:48.260
Stuck in my research this magnifying glass is very good, of course

05:48.500 --> 05:53.380
But I just can't get any further with my botanical research with this old-fashioned equipment

05:54.420 --> 05:57.780
What I really need is a microscope and a laboratory

05:58.980 --> 06:03.060
And they're expensive, I guess. Yes, they are and I don't have any money

06:03.620 --> 06:08.900
Well moment Papa's aunt is coming over tomorrow and I know she's got any amount of money

06:09.300 --> 06:10.500
Any amount?

06:11.220 --> 06:17.620
I'll get her to finance you, Hemiellen and we'll get a big greenhouse and you'll grow orchids and roses and other things

06:17.780 --> 06:21.460
And then we'll sell them. Oh, I'll get rich. You too

06:39.860 --> 06:51.460
Hey, you over there. Hmm. Are you talking to me? Of course I am. Who else?

06:55.860 --> 07:01.780
I said you know the way to move in a house young man. Yes, she might say I do show me where it is then

07:02.500 --> 07:07.060
Over there. It's tall and blue. Just follow that stream and you can't miss it

07:07.860 --> 07:12.740
Good would you be kind enough to take my suitcase? I'm sorry. I can't. I'm too busy

07:13.220 --> 07:16.500
I'll reward you handsomely for your efforts. Think again young man

07:16.980 --> 07:18.980
But all I want to do is fish

07:19.220 --> 07:21.220
What you don't want money

07:25.060 --> 07:29.460
I heard you were coming to visit moment papa. You're in Jane, aren't you? Oh well

07:29.860 --> 07:34.420
Please to meet you. I'm here to take you to moment house. Is this your suitcase?

07:38.020 --> 07:43.700
Wow, this suitcase is very heavy. Should they? It's full of golden coins

07:59.460 --> 08:06.260
I can't stay in this house. I don't think I can take Aunt Jane. I'm going to hide out in the cave until she's gone

08:07.140 --> 08:09.140
Oh

08:12.020 --> 08:14.020
Bye-bye, Lindaer

08:14.180 --> 08:18.420
Careful now, Aunt Jane. The banks have been slippery here and there

08:26.500 --> 08:30.100
Around house house stupid typical of my nephew

08:31.460 --> 08:33.940
Welcome to moment house Aunt Jane

08:33.940 --> 08:35.940
Welcome Aunt Jane

08:36.420 --> 08:38.420
I'd like you to meet us on moment

08:39.460 --> 08:41.460
Please to meet you

08:43.060 --> 08:50.500
She's very small for a daughter. Oh little my isn't ours. She just lives here and I won't get any bigger either

08:52.260 --> 08:57.860
She's like a member of the family and was my worthless nephew. Why isn't he here? Oh

08:58.340 --> 09:05.620
Well, he's a not a is he not at home? Well, no when will he be back? I don't know

09:06.020 --> 09:11.620
He's away looking for inspiration for his work. So he won't be back for a while since when has he worked?

09:11.780 --> 09:18.340
I'm here to see him. Maybe you can see me instead. What a splendid idea. How clever of you, movement

09:18.820 --> 09:24.820
Ridiculous. He knows nothing about money in that case. It is high time. He learned as for his father

09:25.060 --> 09:27.060
I may still disinherit him

09:28.420 --> 09:35.700
I'm a member of his family too. I could talk to you about money matters. Really? Oh sniff is a great friend of mine

09:36.260 --> 09:38.260
Hmm

09:39.300 --> 09:41.300
But hardly a member of the family

09:43.060 --> 09:50.100
Hello moment and you must be on Jane. I brought my brother to snark with me. He wanted to meet you

09:52.420 --> 09:54.420
This is Aunt Jane be nice to

09:55.380 --> 10:02.100
Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane. This is my lovely sister snort maiden who is moving special friend

10:02.500 --> 10:08.260
The snorts and the movements may one day be related so in a way we're all really family

10:08.580 --> 10:10.820
You maybe but not to me

10:11.380 --> 10:19.780
I'm an inventor and due to an accident. I'm looking around for a sponsor a golden opportunity for anyone with some loose capital

10:20.340 --> 10:22.900
Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane

10:23.700 --> 10:33.620
I'm him milling a botanist of note. I heard that you might be willing to fund my scientific research and chain a golden opportunity for anyone with some spare money

10:34.260 --> 10:36.260
You'd like me to fund your research

10:36.900 --> 10:42.980
It was my idea if we built a greenhouse and grow rare orchids and roses we can make a lot of money

10:43.460 --> 10:47.460
And you'll make a lot of money young man. I have a lot of money already

10:47.860 --> 10:51.140
Oh, hasn't sniffed discuss this with you ma'am. You sniffed

10:51.300 --> 10:54.500
Well, I was just getting around to it, Hamilton. Confusing

10:54.660 --> 11:00.100
When I am famous for my botanical research and Jane, I don't know that will ever happen

11:00.260 --> 11:05.140
This is very confusing indeed for me now. You're snork maiden a friend of movement is that right?

11:05.300 --> 11:12.660
Oh, no, I'm the snork snort maiden's brother. I'm a friend of Moomin at Jane. Did you really explain about my important research sniff?

11:12.980 --> 11:15.460
Did you really explain that I'm a member of the family?

11:15.460 --> 11:23.060
Hey, she got it. So, Jane would be great if you weren't a member to make your own coin coin everyone

11:35.780 --> 11:43.380
Here's your room, Jane. I do hope you'll be comfortable here. Just call if you need anything

11:45.860 --> 11:47.860
Oh

11:51.700 --> 11:53.700
Come out

11:58.500 --> 12:01.540
Here's your suitcase. It was very heavy. Thank you

12:04.980 --> 12:06.980
And him

12:07.300 --> 12:14.180
What is it you want a reward? No, no, Jane. I mean, yes, I do but

12:14.660 --> 12:16.660
Uh

12:16.660 --> 12:23.620
Which is it will you make up your mind young man? I know where Moomin Papa is right now. He's a whale on a trip

12:23.620 --> 12:29.460
I know. No, no. He's somewhere quite near quite near here. Well, where is he?

12:30.180 --> 12:35.140
Moomin Papa said not to tell you where he's hiding. It's a secret. A secret? Yes

12:35.700 --> 12:41.060
I suppose I can tell you but he'll be very angry. Where is he? Tell me now. Oh, well

12:41.780 --> 12:43.780
If I tell you I'm taking a big risk

12:45.060 --> 12:48.980
Oh, very well. How much do you want? I'll leave that to you

12:49.700 --> 12:51.700
Oh

13:13.460 --> 13:17.460
Thank you for the information now you shall have your reward held out your hand

13:19.860 --> 13:20.980
Oh

13:20.980 --> 13:25.300
Is that all until I've seen him for myself with my own eyes. Yes

13:31.940 --> 13:33.940
Huh

13:34.740 --> 13:40.660
Oh, there's nobody here. Where is my worthless nephew? This is very strange

13:42.580 --> 13:46.740
You tricked me haven't you? Well, no, I swear I would never do that

13:47.220 --> 13:50.420
You certainly deserve no reward

13:51.060 --> 13:59.220
Uh, but no way if we just look around we'll find him. He's in here somewhere. I know it. Hey, Moomin Papa, I got rid of her

14:05.380 --> 14:10.740
Moomin mom. Yes, Aunt Jane. What is it? Tell me where my nephew is hiding

14:11.860 --> 14:14.580
Well as I said before I want to know the truth

14:15.140 --> 14:18.020
There he he's now let me see

14:18.340 --> 14:19.860
Come on hurry up

14:20.100 --> 14:26.180
He's hiding in the cave down by the beach. I've just been there Moomin Mama and I can't find him

14:27.300 --> 14:32.180
Then he really must have gone away on a trip and why should he want to hide from me anyway

14:32.660 --> 14:38.340
I think he might be a little bit afraid of you afraid of me afraid of his own hand

14:39.460 --> 14:42.580
But why mostly he's afraid of money matters

14:42.580 --> 14:44.180
Incredible

14:44.180 --> 14:46.340
Afraid of me because of money matters

14:47.300 --> 14:49.300
He must be utterly mad

14:50.420 --> 14:52.420
What a family

14:52.420 --> 14:54.420
I don't understand

14:54.580 --> 14:57.220
It seems that only Smith knows anything about money

15:00.340 --> 15:02.740
I know where Moomin Papa is right now

15:02.740 --> 15:05.540
So you want some of my gold who do you young lady?

15:06.100 --> 15:08.820
I couldn't care less about your silly gold

15:08.820 --> 15:10.980
My silly gold indeed

15:10.980 --> 15:14.420
With silly gold, I assure you you can do just anything you want

15:14.420 --> 15:19.460
Seems to me your silly gold doesn't even help you to find Moomin Papa

15:19.860 --> 15:22.580
Hmm? I think you should forget about your money

15:23.300 --> 15:26.740
Young lady, money isn't something you can just forget about

15:26.740 --> 15:28.740
It needs constant looking after

15:28.740 --> 15:31.460
That's why I must talk to Moomin Papa at once

15:31.460 --> 15:33.860
Now take me to that rascal nephew of mine

15:33.860 --> 15:36.020
If you really know where he is, do you hear me?

15:39.780 --> 15:41.780
Do you hear me?

15:41.780 --> 15:44.820
Oh yes, I do

15:44.820 --> 15:46.820
Do you hear me?

15:46.820 --> 15:48.820
Of course

15:50.820 --> 15:52.820
Oh wow frivolous

15:52.820 --> 15:55.620
Not really, if I could find a small enough boyfriend

15:55.620 --> 15:58.020
I'd be frivolous just like them too

15:58.020 --> 16:00.820
Oh well, Frederick and I were frivolous once

16:00.820 --> 16:02.820
Really? If you say so

16:02.820 --> 16:04.820
I suppose I have to believe you

16:09.620 --> 16:10.420
Fuck

16:10.420 --> 16:14.820
What? Little May and Anne Jane walking together

16:16.820 --> 16:18.820
What are they doing?

16:18.820 --> 16:20.820
Little May is plotting something

16:20.820 --> 16:22.820
Really?

16:22.820 --> 16:24.820
Moomin?

16:28.820 --> 16:30.820
Sniff's all right really

16:30.820 --> 16:36.820
But sometimes he just can't withstand the lure of gold

16:36.820 --> 16:38.820
Check me

16:38.820 --> 16:40.820
No, we can't be right

16:40.820 --> 16:42.820
Let's go back then

16:44.820 --> 16:46.820
Fine, just take your time

16:46.820 --> 16:48.820
Hi guys

16:48.820 --> 16:50.820
Little May, what's the matter?

16:50.820 --> 16:52.820
We have a guest

16:52.820 --> 16:54.820
A guest

16:54.820 --> 16:56.820
Moomin Papa

16:56.820 --> 16:58.820
What?

16:58.820 --> 17:00.820
Moomin Papa

17:00.820 --> 17:06.820
Oh, so this is where you've been hiding?

17:06.820 --> 17:08.820
Oh, what else?

17:08.820 --> 17:10.820
You just wait

17:10.820 --> 17:12.820
Oh, you shoot

17:12.820 --> 17:16.820
Oh, I have seen Moomin

17:16.820 --> 17:18.820
Wait a minute

17:18.820 --> 17:20.820
No, you wait first

17:20.820 --> 17:22.820
Wait a minute

17:22.820 --> 17:24.820
Wait please

17:24.820 --> 17:26.820
Moomin Papa was sort of on his way back from a trip

17:26.820 --> 17:28.820
and then stopped by to play chess with me

17:28.820 --> 17:30.820
Yes, exactly

17:30.820 --> 17:32.820
No, yes, Moomin Mama told her the truth

17:32.820 --> 17:36.820
Oh, I sort of stopped by

17:36.820 --> 17:38.820
Why are you so afraid of me, young man?

17:38.820 --> 17:40.820
Well, I'm not really

17:40.820 --> 17:42.820
I mean, it's not you

17:42.820 --> 17:44.820
It's your money, I'm afraid of it

17:44.820 --> 17:46.820
Really scares me

17:46.820 --> 17:48.820
Scared of my money?

17:48.820 --> 17:50.820
Well, I know

17:50.820 --> 17:52.820
It's perfectly good money at all in gold coins

17:52.820 --> 17:56.820
Listen, nephew, I'm depending on you as my only relative

17:56.820 --> 17:58.820
Yes, yes, please depend

17:58.820 --> 18:02.820
When I get too old to do it, you must look after my gold for me

18:02.820 --> 18:04.820
I'm relying on you

18:04.820 --> 18:06.820
No, that's not possible

18:06.820 --> 18:08.820
I know, and Jane, we can give it all away

18:08.820 --> 18:10.820
Must be those who'd love to have it

18:10.820 --> 18:12.820
Must be those who need it more than we do

18:12.820 --> 18:14.820
Oh, and green

18:14.820 --> 18:16.820
Oh

18:16.820 --> 18:18.820
Ah

18:18.820 --> 18:20.820
Ah

18:20.820 --> 18:22.820
Ah

18:22.820 --> 18:24.820
Ah

18:24.820 --> 18:26.820
Ah

18:26.820 --> 18:28.820
She's crazy

18:28.820 --> 18:32.820
Don't worry, we'll think of something

18:32.820 --> 18:36.820
Oh, you would throw my money away without a cut

18:36.820 --> 18:38.820
Why didn't mean to hurt you, Jane?

18:38.820 --> 18:40.820
I know, let's put it all in the bank

18:40.820 --> 18:42.820
Money likes being in the bank

18:42.820 --> 18:48.820
My money would hate being in a back of a terrible idea

18:48.820 --> 18:52.820
Oh no, banks are so nice nowadays

18:52.820 --> 19:00.820
Of course, they have flowers and shiny piggy banks and pretty paintings on the wall

19:00.820 --> 19:02.820
Is that really true?

19:02.820 --> 19:06.820
Right, come on everybody

19:06.820 --> 19:10.820
Let's hurry home and fix a welcoming party for Jane

19:10.820 --> 19:14.820
Yes, any reason is good enough

19:24.820 --> 19:28.820
This was Grandma's best cake recipe, welcome at Jane

19:28.820 --> 19:34.820
Let's drink a toast to the only millionaire in our small circle

19:34.820 --> 19:40.820
May she live a long and healthy life, cheers, cheers

19:46.820 --> 19:50.820
Now, this is your welcoming party at Jane, what's the matter?

19:50.820 --> 19:54.820
Never in my life of I and my money felt ourselves as welcome before

19:54.820 --> 19:58.820
I'm so happy I could cry

19:58.820 --> 20:02.820
And once you start crying, you just want to go on

20:02.820 --> 20:06.820
Please don't be unhappy, Jane, don't cry

20:06.820 --> 20:10.820
Oh, dear, mum and Papa

20:10.820 --> 20:12.820
Mum and Papa

20:12.820 --> 20:14.820
Yes, Jane, what is it?

20:14.820 --> 20:18.820
I'll put some of my gold in a bank, but you must look after the rest when I'm too old

20:18.820 --> 20:20.820
Oh, hmm

20:20.820 --> 20:22.820
And why not?

20:22.820 --> 20:28.820
All right, we'll keep it in the cellar and make a nice little niche for it with seashells and moss

20:28.820 --> 20:32.820
Someone go down and look at it every week, don't you worry, Jane, your money will be in safe hands

20:32.820 --> 20:36.820
Not quite, but I had in mind

20:36.820 --> 20:38.820
I know

20:38.820 --> 20:40.820
But I suppose it can't be helped

20:40.820 --> 20:44.820
It sounds rather nice, a cozy little niche down in the cellar

20:44.820 --> 20:48.820
And if you take a look every week, but oh dear, it will miss me

20:48.820 --> 20:50.820
Oh, and Jane

20:50.820 --> 20:54.820
Very well, I have made up my mind

20:54.820 --> 20:58.820
Leaving this sickest with you now, so you and my gold can get certain used to each other

20:58.820 --> 21:02.820
Do what you want with it, your friends seem to have ideas about how to spend it

21:02.820 --> 21:06.820
Flying ships and botanical research sound rather splendid

21:06.820 --> 21:10.820
Oh, oh, wonder

21:10.820 --> 21:12.820
I'm so happy for you

21:12.820 --> 21:16.820
Darn, I should have let us up better than flowers

21:16.820 --> 21:20.820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

21:20.820 --> 21:24.820
So ended the visit of the dreaded Anne Jane

21:24.820 --> 21:30.820
And I'm sure Sniff will be able to think of some other use for the gold

21:32.820 --> 21:38.820
They love the laughter, and they love the living, the movements

21:38.820 --> 21:46.820
We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

21:46.820 --> 21:50.820
They're always happy and always at play

21:50.820 --> 21:57.820
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements

21:57.820 --> 22:07.820
The movements, the movements
