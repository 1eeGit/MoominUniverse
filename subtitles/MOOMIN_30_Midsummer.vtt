02:04.280 --> 02:12.160
ever all about a princess she fell asleep in a rose bush she was so lovely I've

02:12.160 --> 02:17.520
got to see that one again but who will guard my prisoners I wonder I'm a good

02:17.520 --> 02:21.720
idea officer you could take the three of us with you to the theater to see the play

02:21.720 --> 02:27.560
good idea we love the theater so we won't try to run away officer I promise

02:28.120 --> 02:33.880
not possible I won't let you out of this jail until you write out it's forbidden to burn

02:33.880 --> 02:40.600
signs five thousand times each that's the punishment for vandals well in that case you won't be

02:40.600 --> 02:48.680
able to see the play who cares although yes I must see it I must go so you'll take us with you

02:48.680 --> 02:54.520
no you stay right here well then you can't go either officer right you're upsetting me

02:55.400 --> 03:02.680
no no this isn't good enough it's not true drama please woman papa I don't want to be just a

03:02.680 --> 03:08.680
lion's ugly behind but sniff I did give you another part I don't want to be a baby either

03:08.680 --> 03:13.560
and she said you wanted parts with that lines it could you do the dusting a bit later Emma please

03:14.520 --> 03:19.480
he's script should be ready now we have to start practicing for the opening night tomorrow morning

03:20.120 --> 03:25.560
don't worry Emma it's coming along I'm only half done I shall never get ready in time

03:25.560 --> 03:30.120
moment mama you're right to worry for the curtain will rise tomorrow no matter what

03:32.520 --> 03:37.720
women papa will remember to give Emma lots and lots of lines she's really looking forward to

03:37.720 --> 03:45.000
her first performance all right now leave me I must be left alone to concentrate the writer needs

03:45.000 --> 03:50.840
peace and quiet there are some things I don't like about this script I'll discuss it with you

03:50.840 --> 03:56.680
after the performance sniff after if it's a story about lost children why do you have to have a

03:56.680 --> 04:03.560
stupid lion I'm too good an actor to be cast as a lion keep them out of my hair when indeed he's

04:03.560 --> 04:09.640
giving me a headache you come with me sniff we'll practice our parts this could be a wonderful

04:09.640 --> 04:16.040
play if you'd only skip the lions behind I've heard enough about this behind remember we have

04:16.040 --> 04:22.040
a lion's head too dying to show his acting skills on the stage this is my play and I refuse

04:22.040 --> 04:32.120
to write out the lion's part I refuse here's the key I want you to keep a keen eye on them until

04:32.120 --> 04:38.760
I come back do you understand me cousin are they very dangerous yes they certainly are they bite

04:38.760 --> 04:44.600
if you let them out okay we certainly wouldn't bite anyone obviously I've had enough of your

04:44.600 --> 04:50.440
lies don't listen to my dear cousin they do well then now I'm up to the theater to see the play

04:51.320 --> 04:59.320
take good care of them while I'm gone

04:59.880 --> 05:15.160
excuse me you seem to be a very good knitter oh thank you nobody ever said that to me before I enjoy it

05:15.160 --> 05:21.800
what are you making I'm not sure I don't really know nothing in particular it's just that

05:21.800 --> 05:28.680
knitting is so reassuring somehow nothing bad can happen while you knit can it trouble is I

05:28.680 --> 05:36.200
always seem to forget to decide what to make before I start but it feels nice and warm and I

05:36.200 --> 05:44.280
love the color couldn't you make socks it's a very nice sock color socks yes it's very very

05:44.280 --> 05:53.960
cold in here oh yes that's a very good idea listen if I knitted each one of you a pair of warm

05:54.040 --> 06:01.480
socks would you really put them on of course that will be nice I'm almost freezing to death in here

06:01.480 --> 06:08.920
it's so very very cold is it really that cold yes my teeth are chattering so I could hardly talk

06:08.920 --> 06:17.960
honestly oh dear oh dear what should I do maybe some steaming hot black currant juice would help

06:17.960 --> 06:23.400
to warm us up a little possibly although it might already be too late

06:40.680 --> 06:46.120
my cousin would be very angry with me if he knew but I think but you think why I think I'll

06:46.120 --> 06:57.960
let you out so that we can all be nice and warm indoors really don't cry now baby there's a good

06:57.960 --> 07:13.000
boy don't cry honey that's enough baby oh woman mama you need to show much more immersion it's

07:13.000 --> 07:19.320
right to be more motherly and more loving listen dear this is a very happy baby how am I doing

07:19.320 --> 07:24.280
woman papa you're just perfect for the part sniffing your performance was excellent

07:26.520 --> 07:38.280
maybe I should add a part with some lines in it

07:43.320 --> 07:49.160
look at these I think they might be ready by now I hope they're tasty they don't always come out

07:49.160 --> 07:56.440
very well you're so kind we've had so much already but they smell really delicious they sure do

07:56.440 --> 08:02.440
thank you so much now I feel warm again how about some more black currant juice or maybe one of these

08:02.440 --> 08:07.720
freshly baked cookies it's very kind of you but no thank you I couldn't eat another thing I'm so

08:07.720 --> 08:18.440
full up me too oh dear the party is over then I'm afraid so it's really sad but I have to

08:18.440 --> 08:23.480
lock you up again but at least I know you're warm in there we're really sorry too but you don't

08:23.480 --> 08:29.880
need to worry because actually we're not going back to jail oh aren't you we've got other plans

08:29.880 --> 08:36.120
we're going to the theater to see my parents play and I suppose I should say hello to my Aunt Emma

08:36.120 --> 08:43.800
who works there oh what shall I do my cousin will be very cross with me but you see we're innocent

08:43.800 --> 08:51.400
we didn't do anything wrong you didn't I swear it do I look like someone who pulls up signs in a

08:51.400 --> 08:56.680
park we just burned some flats and left by the flood but your cousin wouldn't believe it he

08:56.680 --> 09:03.560
jumped to conclusions wrongful arrest that's all it was oh dear why didn't you tell me that it

09:03.560 --> 09:10.120
once oh people shouldn't go to jail when they haven't done anything wrong so we can go to the

09:10.120 --> 09:15.560
theaters that okay of course better leave right away my cousin will be very disappointed but I

09:15.560 --> 09:22.120
guess I can't be helped wait for me I think I'd better come along and explain to that cousin of

09:22.120 --> 09:28.360
mind that his three prisoners are innocent of the charge against them

09:29.160 --> 09:37.080
all right all right bring it in that's right momma stop there okay sniff moment mama what have

09:37.080 --> 09:43.080
you got there a baby's crib I want to use this in the play if that's all right with you

09:43.080 --> 09:49.720
moment papa moment papa I just read your script and I think you have a big problem who is going

09:49.720 --> 09:55.080
to pay the parts of moment and snorkemaiden in this play of yours I don't know yet we don't have

09:55.080 --> 10:01.000
any more children and sniff can't take the part are you utterly mad we only have a few hours

10:01.000 --> 10:05.880
before the curtain goes up and you don't even have actors for all the part what kind of director is

10:05.880 --> 10:10.840
that maybe one of us could stand behind something and sort of read their line we did kill us

10:10.920 --> 10:20.440
idea let's hope the credits are brown hold on tight all of you

10:25.640 --> 10:29.160
listen kids you can be as noisy as you like out here but once we're at the

10:29.160 --> 10:38.280
