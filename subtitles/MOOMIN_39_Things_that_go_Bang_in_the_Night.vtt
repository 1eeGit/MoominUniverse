00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:47.000 --> 01:06.000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
What?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
What?

01:08.000 --> 01:20.900
Big explosions could be heard in Moomin Valley almost every night, and Moomin couldn't sleep

01:20.900 --> 01:21.900
awake.

01:21.900 --> 01:29.680
Usually there was just one, but sometimes even two.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.680
You heard it too, Moomin, pop up.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.480
Yes, those loud bangs are kicking me awake.

01:34.480 --> 01:39.760
I wonder if there'll be another one.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.960
They seem to be coming from the north.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.680
Hmm, he's sti-thought.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.800
Or they could be coming from lonely mountains.

01:45.800 --> 01:49.360
If you ask me, I believe they're the work of the witch.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.360
The witch?

01:50.360 --> 01:52.560
But witches don't make a lot of noise.

01:52.560 --> 01:53.560
Never know.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.200
They're sneaky characters.

01:56.200 --> 02:00.960
Tomorrow I'll have a few words with the inspector, except to him to put a stop to it.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.800
Papa, why would the witch want to make explosions?

02:03.800 --> 02:04.800
Why not?

02:04.800 --> 02:09.320
The first bang wakes me up, and then I lie awake waiting for the second one, which might

02:09.320 --> 02:10.920
not come at all.

02:10.920 --> 02:14.760
The bags might not come from Moomin Valley at all, and they might be just an echo off

02:14.760 --> 02:15.760
the mountains.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.760
Do you think so?

02:16.760 --> 02:17.760
Yes, I do.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.520
Well, at least that's what Snuffkin thinks.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.800
And the explosions might come from the sea.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.280
That's what Snuffkin figured.

02:23.280 --> 02:26.360
He thought it might be pirates or something making the noises.

02:26.360 --> 02:30.040
He's already had pirates, and they went a long time ago.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.520
I'm plumping for the witch.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.520
There's no doubt in my mind.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.080
What are you doing out here?

02:34.080 --> 02:36.920
We're waiting for another explosion, Mama.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.480
You're waiting, Vane, dear.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.480
No, no, no, no, that Moomin, Mama.

02:40.480 --> 02:44.720
Well, we had two explosions last night, and we've never had double explosions for two

02:44.720 --> 02:47.720
nights in a row.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.560
Until now, that is.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.560
You heard that.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.960
It clearly came from over there.

02:51.960 --> 02:52.960
Over there?

02:52.960 --> 02:53.960
Oh, no.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.320
It certainly came from over there.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.760
You couldn't mistake it.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.760
I'm sure of it.

03:02.520 --> 03:12.320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.840
Good morning, Moomin, lovely day.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.280
Good morning, Snuffkin.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.760
You look very sleepy.

03:16.760 --> 03:20.960
So would you be opposed to explosions that kept you awake for most of the night?

03:20.960 --> 03:23.280
Those explosions are really very hard, aren't they?

03:23.280 --> 03:24.760
They certainly are.

03:24.760 --> 03:27.760
Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?

03:27.760 --> 03:31.040
Moomin, Papa's convinced that she's the one who's making the bangs.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.540
I think he's wrong there.

03:32.540 --> 03:36.040
That's what I thought, but there's nothing I could say to convince him.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.040
So now I'm going to find out for myself.

03:39.040 --> 03:43.040
You can certainly ask her, but do you really trust a witch to tell you the truth?

03:45.040 --> 03:46.040
Do you, a woman?

03:46.040 --> 03:49.040
But witches don't have to lie, Shirley.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.040
Is that you, Little My?

04:01.040 --> 04:03.040
And where are you two going?

04:03.040 --> 04:04.040
Little My.

04:04.040 --> 04:07.040
Are you tailing me full time or what?

04:07.040 --> 04:12.040
Yes, whenever you're sneaking off somewhere, I'm not sneaking, I'm just walking.

04:12.040 --> 04:15.040
Well, I've never seen anyone walking in such a sneaky way.

04:20.040 --> 04:24.040
Last time the witch tried to keep you from waking up, didn't she?

04:24.040 --> 04:25.040
So?

04:25.040 --> 04:28.040
So you think now she's trying to keep you from sleeping?

04:28.040 --> 04:32.040
Well, if she makes the explosions, it's always possible that someone else is the target.

04:32.040 --> 04:37.040
We know very little about witches, and those bangs are probably nothing to do with the movements.

04:38.040 --> 04:42.040
I think you guessed right, but try telling that to the movements.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.040
We don't think it's like that at all.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.040
Wonder if she's at home.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.040
If she isn't, we can visit Alicia instead.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.040
Better ask Alicia than the witch.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.040
Anyway, she's more likely to tell us the truth.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.040
Yes, you're right.

05:08.040 --> 05:11.040
Look, you don't seem to realize this is a witch's house.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.040
What do you mean by that?

05:13.040 --> 05:15.040
I'll tell you what I mean.

05:15.040 --> 05:19.040
What I mean is, I don't want to be seen talking with goody-goodies like the moments.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.040
You think they'll ruin your reputation, is that why you're so worried?

05:23.040 --> 05:24.040
Hmm.

05:26.040 --> 05:30.040
Uh, there's just something very important we wanted to ask you.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.040
And then we'll leave straight away.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.040
That room upstairs, is that Alicia's?

05:41.040 --> 05:42.040
It is.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.040
Is Alicia there now?

05:44.040 --> 05:45.040
No, she isn't.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.040
Where did she go?

05:46.040 --> 05:48.040
She went to get some wolf's vein.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.040
When will she be coming back?

05:49.040 --> 05:51.040
You're not going to stop her studying.

05:52.040 --> 05:57.040
No, we wanted to ask her something about that loud noise we hear every night.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.040
Ah, that one.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.040
Hey, are you the one making the bangs?

06:01.040 --> 06:04.040
I don't make explosions.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.040
Who is it then?

06:05.040 --> 06:06.040
I really don't know.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.040
But why did you say that one then?

06:08.040 --> 06:10.040
Because the explosions bother me, too.

06:12.040 --> 06:14.040
You think they're coming from near here?

06:14.040 --> 06:17.040
I think they're coming from far away from the sea, maybe.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.040
That's what snuffkin' things, too.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.040
Any sound from the sea echoes off Lonely Mountain,

06:22.040 --> 06:24.040
so you think that's where it comes from?

06:24.040 --> 06:26.040
Why is young man, a few days ago,

06:26.040 --> 06:29.040
I went all the way over to the beach to see what was happening.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.040
After a whole day's witching and casting magic spells,

06:32.040 --> 06:34.040
one needs one sleep, you know.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.040
So, what did you find them?

06:36.040 --> 06:37.040
Nothing at all.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.040
There was only one explosion that night,

06:39.040 --> 06:42.040
so when I got there on my brun, there was nothing more to see.

06:42.040 --> 06:45.040
Then we still have no idea who makes the bangs.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.040
No, and I'm really upset you thought it was me.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.040
When a witch creates an explosion,

06:50.040 --> 06:53.040
it doesn't sound anything like a camel cough.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.040
I can tell you.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.040
Camel cough, I like that.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.040
Thank you very much, Snork Maiden.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.040
This year I want to grow some black tulips.

07:19.040 --> 07:22.040
Is there really such a thing as a black tulip?

07:22.040 --> 07:24.040
There's such a dark red, they look black.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.040
Oh, I see.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.040
Although it wouldn't really surprise me, Snork Maiden,

07:28.040 --> 07:30.040
if there really were black ones somewhere.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.040
We must ask the hamulineal now.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.040
Oh, yes.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.040
I know it's embarrassing, but I'm so excited.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.040
I can't go to sleep at night.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.040
Oh, I have no problem going to sleep at night,

07:41.040 --> 07:43.040
but that noise wakes me up, Pamuline.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.040
What noise is that?

07:44.040 --> 07:47.040
I told you that noise.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.040
Oh, I see.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.040
You're talking about the explosion.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.040
You know anything about it, Mr. Hemuline.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.040
No, nothing at all.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.040
No, those bangs are not what keeps me awake,

07:57.040 --> 07:59.040
moment papa.

07:59.040 --> 08:02.040
No, I'm waiting for a pie from the botanist federation.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.040
Reply.

08:03.040 --> 08:06.040
Yes, don't you remember a few months ago?

08:06.040 --> 08:09.040
Housecrange, I thought I told you about it.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.040
Well, I certainly told everyone else I know.

08:12.040 --> 08:15.040
I sent them a brand new species.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.040
New species.

08:16.040 --> 08:19.040
I've never seen anything like it in my whole life.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.040
A new wild orchid.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.040
I'm so excited I can hardly speak.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.040
Really?

08:24.040 --> 08:25.040
A new wild orchid.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.040
How very interesting.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.040
Yes, isn't it?

08:28.040 --> 08:30.040
Oh, it would be such a great honor for me

08:30.040 --> 08:33.040
and for everyone else that they call it orchidokahemulinesis

08:33.040 --> 08:34.040
or hemiliformis.

08:34.040 --> 08:36.040
No, I'm sure they will.

08:36.040 --> 08:40.040
So now you understand why I've had so many sleepless nights.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.040
Yes, indeed.

08:42.040 --> 08:44.040
Trouble is they should have answered by now.

08:44.040 --> 08:47.040
Maybe they're still trying to decide what to call it.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.040
Maybe they can't decide between orchidokahemulinesis

08:50.040 --> 08:53.040
and orchidokahemuliformis.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.040
Mmm.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.040
Oh.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.040
What is it?

08:57.040 --> 09:00.040
Now I see at last I understand.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.040
I am getting no reply from the botanist federation

09:03.040 --> 09:06.040
because it is not a new species.

09:06.040 --> 09:10.040
Oh, of course somebody's already found it.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.040
Oh.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.040
It is still too funny.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.040
No, no.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.040
Stupid I am.

09:17.040 --> 09:21.040
This is the end of me as a scientist of course.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.040
Calm down.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.040
Don't upset yourself, Mr. Himulun.

09:24.040 --> 09:28.040
Everybody will laugh at me and call me Mr. Himulinesis.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.040
Now listen, Mr. Himulun.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.040
The reply is a long time coming

09:32.040 --> 09:35.040
because they must examine your plant most carefully

09:35.040 --> 09:37.040
before making a decision.

09:37.040 --> 09:41.040
They must read all the books first to be sure.

09:41.040 --> 09:45.040
You really think so, Mum and Batman?

09:45.040 --> 09:47.040
Could it really take so long, do you think?

09:47.040 --> 09:49.040
Of course, these things take time.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.040
When did you send it off?

09:51.040 --> 09:53.040
A month ago.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.040
There you are, that's no time at all.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.040
You have to learn to be patient, Emulun.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.040
You think so?

09:58.040 --> 10:00.040
Oh, I feel better already.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.040
Oh, I'm so glad you feel happier, Mr. Himulun.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.040
Don't you worry, my friend.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.040
Mama, great news dear.

10:06.040 --> 10:09.040
Mr. Himulun has discovered a completely new plant

10:09.040 --> 10:11.040
and is going to be called Himulinesis.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.040
Oh, that's wonderful.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.040
Congratulations, Mr. Himulun.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.040
Oh, well, it isn't official yet.

10:18.040 --> 10:21.040
No, they're just thinking about the name still.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.040
Give them time.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.040
We should have a party for Mr. Himulun.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.040
Shouldn't we, Papa?

10:25.040 --> 10:26.040
What?

10:26.040 --> 10:28.040
Oh, yes, indeed.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.040
When, Papa, tonight?

10:31.040 --> 10:33.040
Hmm, let me think.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.040
We should wait just a little bit longer perhaps.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.040
Oh, why do you say that?

10:38.040 --> 10:41.040
Mr. Himulun, you know that rare plant you found?

10:41.040 --> 10:43.040
Does it have any flowers?

10:43.040 --> 10:44.040
But, of course.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.040
Are they pretty?

10:45.040 --> 10:47.040
Very pretty.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.040
Yes, just like you, Snorke Maiden.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.040
Oh, Mr. Himulun.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.040
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.040
Hey, look, Snorke Maiden.

10:57.040 --> 11:01.040
Why don't we go and find out about those explosions tonight, huh?

11:01.040 --> 11:02.040
All right.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.040
You'll need me to find the way.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.040
You want to come along?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.040
You bet.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.040
They come late at night.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.040
I won't go to sleep, bad.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.040
What do you think, Snorke Maiden?

11:12.040 --> 11:13.040
I'm not sure.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.040
Isn't there anything you can do to change your mind, movement?

11:15.040 --> 11:16.040
I don't know.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.040
Listen, little Maiden.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.040
You have to be careful.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.040
This could be dangerous.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.040
Obviously, or I would.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.040
Come, would I, spoil my sleep?

11:23.040 --> 11:25.040
Well, stick close to us, then.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.040
Yes, do that.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.040
I also went down to the beach late last night

11:28.040 --> 11:30.040
to try and find out what was happening.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.040
And while I was there, I saw the witch flying around

11:32.040 --> 11:33.040
on her broomstick.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.040
Oh, really?

11:34.040 --> 11:37.040
Why didn't you tell me so I could have come along?

11:37.040 --> 11:38.040
I could hide better than you.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.040
You're so white.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.040
See, movement?

11:40.040 --> 11:43.040
I'm not big in way like you.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.040
Oh, there's someone coming.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.040
Who?

11:47.040 --> 11:49.040
Oh, there's someone coming.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.040
Who?

11:53.040 --> 11:54.040
It's Alicia.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.040
Hey, Alicia.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.040
Hi, Alicia.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.040
Oh, my man.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.040
Hey, Alicia.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.040
How are you?

12:02.040 --> 12:04.040
Have you three come here to play with me?

12:04.040 --> 12:07.040
No, I'm afraid we have, but it's good to see you.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.040
Yes, Alicia.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.040
Yes?

12:10.040 --> 12:13.040
Has your grandmother been kind to you since your last visit to us?

12:13.040 --> 12:14.040
Very kind.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.040
She's been treating me very well.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.040
Ever since I stopped coming to see you.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.040
Oh, good, but we do miss you, Alicia.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.040
Oh, I miss you, too.

12:22.040 --> 12:24.040
But I must keep my promise to her.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.040
She'd be upset if I broke it.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.040
What are these wings?

12:27.040 --> 12:28.040
They're herbs.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.040
Herbs are very important for a witch.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.040
And frogs, bellies, and lizard stales.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.040
They're important, too, of course.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.040
I think that's licorice.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.040
That's right.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.040
Very clever, Snuffkin.

12:38.040 --> 12:40.040
We use that for heartburn and coughs.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.040
They smell quite nice.

12:42.040 --> 12:45.040
And it also stops cows from giving their milk.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.040
I see.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.040
That's interesting.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.040
Oh, it's a ride.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.040
Hi!

13:10.040 --> 13:12.040
Hello, Mr. Hillman.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.040
Splendid days, eh?

13:14.040 --> 13:16.040
Hello, Mr. Hamilton.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.040
Don't you work so hard?

13:18.040 --> 13:20.040
Yeah, I guess I do with that.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.040
Wait, stop.

13:24.040 --> 13:26.040
What is it, Mr. Hamilton?

13:26.040 --> 13:29.040
My letter. I just want my letter.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.040
There isn't one.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.040
But why not?

13:32.040 --> 13:35.040
You didn't have any yesterday or the day before.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.040
Yeah, I know that. Nobody's written to you.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.040
That's why.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.040
Well, somebody should have written.

13:40.040 --> 13:43.040
Are you quite, quite sure that you've gone through your bag properly?

13:43.040 --> 13:47.040
Don't you know I'm expecting an important letter from an important scientist?

13:47.040 --> 13:49.040
It must be in your bag.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.040
Ah, all right, then. Go ahead.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.040
What?

13:52.040 --> 13:55.040
Well, you don't seem to trust me to do my job properly, Mr. Hamilton.

13:55.040 --> 13:58.040
Go ahead. Have a look for yourself, then.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.040
Oh, but of course I trust you.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.040
Sorry.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.040
No, no. You better have a look.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.040
What do you think I do?

14:04.040 --> 14:06.040
Steam them open and read them at night?

14:06.040 --> 14:07.040
No.

14:07.040 --> 14:11.040
Oh, you seem to have a lot of letters today.

14:11.040 --> 14:16.040
Oh, I really think I should ask for a higher salary.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.040
I deserve it.

14:18.040 --> 14:22.040
I'm just starving.

14:22.040 --> 14:26.040
I might have to go over and visit the moments in a minute.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.040
Oh.

14:33.040 --> 14:37.040
I'm sleepy, too. I could go on sleeping.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.040
Oh!

14:39.040 --> 14:41.040
What do you think you're doing?

14:41.040 --> 14:45.040
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

14:45.040 --> 14:48.040
There's nothing else out here and you didn't see me?

14:48.040 --> 14:50.040
I'm sorry.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.040
Oh, dear. What does this matter with you?

14:52.040 --> 14:55.040
Is this place called Moomin Valley?

14:55.040 --> 14:57.040
Yes. That's right.

14:57.040 --> 15:01.040
At last I found it. I never thought I'd really make it.

15:01.040 --> 15:04.040
Excuse me. Are you all right?

15:04.040 --> 15:06.040
Doctor me, miss.

15:06.040 --> 15:09.040
Oh, tell me what's bothering you.

15:09.040 --> 15:12.040
Oh, she's ill. She's got a fever.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.040
Please leave me alone.

15:14.040 --> 15:18.040
But you can lie here. You should be in bad young lady.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.040
Do you know a man called Hamilton?

15:20.040 --> 15:24.040
Yes. Have you walked all the way to Moomin Valley to visit him?

15:24.040 --> 15:28.040
So I have come to the right place. He does live here.

15:28.040 --> 15:30.040
Oh, yes. He lives very close to here.

15:30.040 --> 15:34.040
I'm so glad I must see him immediately here.

15:34.040 --> 15:37.040
Oh, what shall I do? I must do something.

15:37.040 --> 15:41.040
Come here, someone. Someone help me.

15:41.040 --> 15:44.040
Oh, my goodness.

15:44.040 --> 15:50.040
Help! Anyone help! Help me somebody!

15:54.040 --> 16:03.040
Papa! Papa!

16:03.040 --> 16:07.040
He's up in the guest room if you want him. Mama's there as well.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.040
What for?

16:08.040 --> 16:11.040
I just rescued a girl, you know.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.040
A girl? Did you sniff?

16:13.040 --> 16:17.040
That's right. Very pretty too. She's ill and I put her to bed myself.

16:17.040 --> 16:21.040
I'm going to see her. Me too.

16:21.040 --> 16:25.040
I want another look as well.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.040
First, we must bring her fever down.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.040
I think you're right.

16:30.040 --> 16:33.040
Yes?

16:34.040 --> 16:36.040
Sniff just told us about her.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.040
Oh dear, she unconscious.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.040
Yes. Where'd she come from?

16:40.040 --> 16:44.040
We don't know a little, Maya, but Sniff said she'd come here to visit the hemeland.

16:44.040 --> 16:47.040
That's right. Snort Maiden's gone to get him.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.040
She's pretty, isn't she?

16:49.040 --> 16:51.040
You're right. Very.

16:51.040 --> 16:54.040
By the way, Moomin, what did the witch say?

16:54.040 --> 16:58.040
Oh dear, must I really run like this?

16:58.040 --> 17:00.040
Where is she visiting her young girl?

17:00.040 --> 17:03.040
Well, if she's sick, why don't you give her some medicine?

17:03.040 --> 17:05.040
I don't know any young girl's apart from her.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.040
Don't. Just keep running.

17:14.040 --> 17:18.040
I told you. I do not know this person. Maybe she's changed.

17:18.040 --> 17:22.040
I've already told you. I have never known any young girls.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.040
Then why do you think she'd want to come to visit you, hemeland?

17:25.040 --> 17:27.040
She's a botanist.

17:27.040 --> 17:32.040
And obviously she's heard of me and wants to come and see the famous hemeland for herself.

17:32.040 --> 17:35.040
Oh dear, she can tell us when she wakes up.

17:35.040 --> 17:39.040
We must leave her now so that grandma's medicine can work.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.040
I think I'll be getting home.

17:46.040 --> 17:50.040
Oh, we couldn't let you go just like that. Please stay and have some tea with us.

17:50.040 --> 17:53.040
Thank you, but no, I have some plans to press.

17:53.040 --> 17:56.040
And you're sure you're quite sure you don't know this girl?

17:56.040 --> 17:58.040
Absolutely certain.

17:58.040 --> 18:01.040
I really must go.

18:04.040 --> 18:06.040
I'd forgotten all about the bangs.

18:06.040 --> 18:09.040
Well, we haven't snuffed Ken and I. I'm going to look for them tonight.

18:09.040 --> 18:12.040
I'd like to come too, but I can't.

18:12.040 --> 18:15.040
I'm going with them. Are you snort maiden?

18:15.040 --> 18:18.040
You'll be hiding on the beach in the middle of the night?

18:18.040 --> 18:22.040
Yes, and then we'll rush off to where the bangs are coming from as soon as we hear them.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.040
That's the plan.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.040
Oh, I'd really love to come.

18:25.040 --> 18:29.040
I'd rather go to bed. I'd be a bit scared of the beach in the middle of the night.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.040
After all, it's my duty to stay here with Mum and Mama.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.040
Are you coming, Sniff?

18:34.040 --> 18:37.040
Certainly not. Not me.

18:40.040 --> 18:43.040
This just occurred to me. That's why she's here.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.040
Ah.

18:55.040 --> 18:59.040
Here, you better take this moment. You might get very hungry.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.040
Oh, thank you, Mama.

19:01.040 --> 19:04.040
A midnight snack. I really envy you.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.040
Well, Grandpa, why don't you come with us?

19:06.040 --> 19:08.040
Oh, there's nothing I'd love more.

19:08.040 --> 19:11.040
But I'd better not tonight. Right, Mama?

19:11.040 --> 19:13.040
Oh, definitely not.

19:13.040 --> 19:17.040
What would I do if something happened to the girl while you were away?

19:17.040 --> 19:18.040
Exactly.

19:18.040 --> 19:21.040
All right, Papa. We'll find out about the bangs for you.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.040
Thank you, Momenta.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.040
Good.

19:33.040 --> 19:38.040
I think we should save this food for a while. We might have to wait a long time for the explosions.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.040
Then they might not come tonight.

19:40.040 --> 19:44.040
Stop stuffing yourself, Mum, and the rest is for a snuffkin and me.

19:44.040 --> 19:47.040
But you can't eat anymore? Yes, I can.

19:47.040 --> 19:50.040
We must share it in equal parts, otherwise it's not fair.

19:50.040 --> 19:53.040
I think it should be shared in proportion to how big one is.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.040
Hmm.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.040
Hmm?

20:22.040 --> 20:24.040
Oh, where did that come from? From the sea.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.040
Keep a sharp lookout. Look over there.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.040
What is it?

20:31.040 --> 20:34.040
Uh-oh! Wow!

20:34.040 --> 20:36.040
Oh!

20:39.040 --> 20:41.040
That's what I call fireworks.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.040
Come on!

20:45.040 --> 20:47.040
Somebody must be out there in a boat!

20:57.040 --> 20:59.040
There's a boat!

20:59.040 --> 21:02.040
The fireworks must have come from there!

21:02.040 --> 21:04.040
Hey! Come ashore!

21:05.040 --> 21:07.040
Is that the henman you like?

21:07.040 --> 21:10.040
No, I don't think so. It looks like him, but he was much younger.

21:11.040 --> 21:20.040
And so as a result of their excursion to the beach, they finally learned that the big bangs that had been waking everyone up were fireworks.

21:20.040 --> 21:25.040
They also learned that the fireworks were coming from a boat far out to sea.

21:25.040 --> 21:30.040
But the man who had sent them up disappeared into the night.

21:31.040 --> 21:39.040
They loved the laughter and they loved the living the movements.

21:39.040 --> 21:46.040
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

21:46.040 --> 21:50.040
They're always happy and goes at play.

21:50.040 --> 21:57.040
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

21:57.040 --> 22:01.040
The movements.

22:01.040 --> 22:07.040
The movements.
