0	21000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.
29000	36000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land.
36000	41000	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever.
41000	49000	There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,
49000	58000	there were the movements, there were the movements.
79000	92000	There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.
109000	129000	Woman Valley is enjoying another still peaceful summer's day.
129000	135000	However, this lazy lifestyle, no matter how pleasant it might be, does not suit everyone.
135000	141000	Oh, yes.
141000	144000	Would you like a cup of coffee, dear?
144000	147000	Yes, I think I need one, Mama.
147000	149000	Oh dear, is it your memoirs?
149000	150000	I'm stuck.
150000	152000	Ah, can I help?
152000	154000	How can I create in this?
154000	155000	In what?
155000	159000	In this sleepy atmosphere, and I've also come to a boring part.
159000	160000	When was that?
160000	162000	The time I wrote poems.
163000	166000	Were they any good?
166000	167000	No.
167000	169000	Well, miss that bit out then.
169000	171000	I can't.
171000	176000	I must put it down for posterity, it is my duty.
176000	182000	But how can I get inspiration here in this place where nothing ever happens, nothing ever happens at all?
182000	185000	Oh, I think this means another adventure.
185000	193000	Yes, Mama, but I need it to be big, exciting, and frightening.
193000	195000	Mama, what's the matter?
195000	196000	Are you all right?
196000	200000	Your father says that because nothing ever happens here, he can't write.
200000	203000	So I'm looking for an adventure for him.
203000	204000	Can you think of anything?
204000	207000	He wants it to be big, exciting, and frightening.
207000	209000	Does he want something really exciting?
209000	212000	Yes, dear, I'm afraid so.
213000	215000	I think I could manage that.
224000	227000	That looks like the footprint of a huge monster.
237000	241000	Oh, it's a good feeling giving others a bit of excitement.
243000	245000	Just a couple more.
255000	260000	I'm praise the booboo I don't have to do modest work very often.
260000	265000	Phew, that was harder than I thought.
265000	269000	Oi, sleepy heads.
269000	271000	Wake up, everybody!
271000	274000	Mom and Papa, quickly get up!
274000	276000	Mom and Mama, a monster!
276000	279000	You've been visited by a monster!
279000	281000	Wake up before you eat and alive!
281000	284000	Come on, hurry, hurry!
285000	288000	My, what huge tracks.
288000	292000	Ah, that should keep them guessing for a while.
294000	298000	Hmm, it could be a monster from the depths of the ocean.
298000	300000	Something's not right here.
300000	303000	Don't you think it's a bit odd that it came directly to Moome House?
303000	304000	Yeah.
304000	307000	Well, look at the footsteps. They go in a straight line.
307000	311000	Someone must have told it to go to Moome House.
313000	315000	And they're only going one way.
315000	318000	Look, there are tiny footsteps going back to the sea.
318000	321000	Oh, Mama, my monster must still be here then.
321000	324000	Oh, well, not necessarily.
324000	327000	Retracing one's own footsteps is the sign of an advanced intelligence.
327000	330000	Stepping back exactly the way you came.
330000	333000	The tough question is, why would the monster do that?
333000	337000	One is led to believe that it wants us to think it's still here.
337000	341000	Well, in fact, it has gone back to wherever it came from.
341000	344000	Fiddle battle, as my dear mother would say.
344000	347000	But why would it want us to think that, Papa?
347000	349000	It's a spy.
349000	350000	Oh, it's a spy.
350000	351000	Something it shouldn't.
351000	355000	It'd hardly be a good spy if we knew they have to sneak in and out.
356000	360000	I think it's still here. I can feel it. You know what I mean?
361000	363000	Perhaps tonight.
363000	365000	Tonight? What about tonight?
365000	369000	That's when they'll attack. It's gone back to give its report.
369000	371000	How do you know that, Papa?
371000	375000	Well, obviously, that's why it still wants us to believe it's here.
375000	376000	Mama, Mama!
376000	378000	Yes, what is it, Moome?
378000	380000	Something terrible is going to happen.
380000	382000	A monster is going to attack us tonight.
382000	385000	And Papa's excited about it.
385000	388000	Oh, good. That's nice for him.
389000	391000	Hurry, everyone.
391000	394000	I expect the monster will be here soon.
400000	403000	Now hold it still.
404000	407000	This is going to be a good barricade, don't you think?
407000	410000	We'd better make sure it's big enough.
411000	415000	It's hardly any fun at all playing tricks on them. They're so gullible.
417000	421000	If we catch the monster, we can sell it to a zoo.
421000	423000	I'll handle the sale, of course.
423000	426000	I'd rather tame it and keep it as a pet.
427000	430000	We could ride on it to go pig-nicking.
440000	443000	Alright, now for the moat. Here we go.
443000	446000	Hope the well's got enough water in it.
447000	450000	It'll be able to swim in this, Papa.
450000	454000	Yes, it'll remind you to the sea and keep it calm.
454000	458000	This is fresh water, Papa. We'd better put some salt in it.
458000	460000	Good idea, Moome.
460000	463000	We'll plant some seaweed and put some rocks in too,
463000	466000	and then it'll feel really at home.
467000	469000	I wonder when it'll come.
469000	472000	I don't know, but I can feel in my bones it'll be tonight.
472000	474000	And we keep watching till it comes?
474000	476000	Of course we will, constantly.
476000	479000	What if it doesn't come till tomorrow night or the night after that?
479000	484000	It might be a long wait, so we'll take it in turns and remember everybody.
484000	487000	The safe way is to keep it calm.
487000	491000	I don't know, but I can feel in my bones it'll be tonight.
491000	493000	And we keep watching till it comes?
493000	496000	We'll take it in turns and remember everybody.
496000	499000	The safety of Moome in Valley relies upon our vigilance.
499000	501000	We must be ready.
519000	522000	Look at what those fools have done.
522000	525000	It was worth all the trouble.
530000	532000	Look, they put down food as bait.
532000	534000	Moome and Papa must be worn out.
534000	537000	Well, I'll take the food anyway.
537000	538000	Carefully, does it?
538000	540000	Don't want to wake up the guard.
540000	542000	This is great.
544000	548000	I've managed to play a really good trick on the stupid moments,
548000	551000	and they've given me a slap-up meal as well.
557000	559000	The monster's here.
559000	561000	Shut the gate.
561000	563000	There's the rope.
563000	565000	Quickly!
567000	568000	No, the house!
568000	570000	Wake up everybody to ours!
573000	575000	No, it's only me!
575000	577000	Make room, I'll get it!
578000	579000	Oh, where is it?
579000	581000	There's no monster only me!
581000	584000	Please, it's me, it's me Stinky!
584000	585000	Stinky?
585000	587000	Well, it sounds like Stinky.
587000	590000	Be careful everybody, it's a baby monster.
590000	592000	Another monster, please help me!
592000	594000	I made the footprints!
594000	595000	You did?
595000	596000	He's obviously lying.
596000	597000	He's too small.
597000	599000	Watch him or he'll go get his daddy.
599000	601000	No, please, I beg you!
601000	602000	Ah, Moome and Papa?
603000	605000	Oh, hello, Snuffkin.
605000	607000	Why don't you let Stinky go?
607000	608000	It really is him, you know.
608000	610000	It is?
610000	614000	Yes, it was Stinky, and he really did make those footprints.
614000	617000	How do you know that Snuffkin?
617000	621000	I was fishing off the shore last night when I saw him digging the holes.
621000	625000	The little rascal was at it for hours and hours.
633000	633360	The
646000	648000	Why don't you come inside Stinky?
648000	650000	This is great.
650000	652000	It was very good of you to make the footprints.
652000	655000	Papa hasn't had so much fun at ages.
655000	659000	I'm glad it was hard work and I lost all my hair too.
659000	662000	Well, mischief isn't always easy, you know.
662000	664000	You can say that again!
664000	666000	This is delicious!
686000	688000	Papa, are you all right?
688000	691000	Yes, thank you, Moome.
698000	699000	Mama.
699000	700000	Yes, dear?
700000	703000	Shh, I've got something important to tell you.
703000	705000	What is it, Papa?
705000	707000	A secret in my mind is made up.
707000	708000	Of course, dear.
708000	711000	I'm going to run away on an adventure trip.
711000	712000	That's nice for you.
712000	715000	It's a trip without a destination full of mystery,
715000	718000	hazards and hardships, and you're coming to, Mama.
718000	720000	Oh, splendid.
720000	724000	Shall we take all the children or just Moome?
724000	726000	No, no children.
726000	729000	That would be the same as here, only somewhere else.
729000	730000	We'll run away.
730000	732000	Run away, Moome and Papa?
732000	736000	I'll be an adventurer again, just as I was in my last youth.
736000	739000	And with you by my side, we'll have adventure, romance.
739000	742000	All we desire, the sun, the stars.
742000	745000	But what about Moonman? He'll be frantic.
745000	748000	Whoa, then it's time he learned to stand on his own feet.
748000	750000	Fan for himself. Become a man.
750000	752000	We can't protect him forever, you know.
752000	754000	He's big enough to be left by himself.
764000	766000	I'm on, Mama.
768000	770000	Oh, just a moment, Papa.
770000	773000	Oh, you can't take anything more with us.
773000	777000	No, I know, but I forgot to write down where the sugar is.
777000	781000	If they can't find it, they'll just have to do without.
781000	785000	But then they won't be able to make cakes and the tea will taste awful.
785000	790000	Oh, and they'll never find this cinnamon on them. Where shall I leave it?
790000	795000	Goodness, Mama, cinnamon, I ask you when the unknown is calling to us.
795000	798000	I should have gone on my own, indeed, I should.
798000	801000	But then what good is an adventure when you can't say who?
801000	803000	That was a close shave to someone afterwards.
803000	805000	Is there anything wrong, Papa?
805000	808000	No, everything is fine, but we must leave before dawn.
808000	810000	All right.
810000	812000	We have a long way to go.
812000	816000	How far and where? It's very dark, you know.
816000	821000	Yes, isn't it? We'll just follow our feet and they say this way.
829000	832000	Oh, God.
834000	836000	Good morning, Mama.
838000	840000	Mama, where are you?
853000	855000	What's the matter, Moomin?
855000	857000	My parents are missing.
857000	859000	Are you sure? Of course, I'm sure.
859000	861000	That's a bit of a problem. I'm getting hungry.
861000	865000	I need my breakfast. I have to start the day with a good meal.
865000	867000	I'm starving. Me too.
871000	877000	Don't worry, Moomin. I'm sure that Moomin, Mama and Moomin, Papa will be back home very soon.
877000	879000	But where could they have gone to, Snuffkin?
879000	882000	No idea. Have they left a note?
882000	884000	Have you had your breakfast yet, Moomin?
884000	888000	No, nothing. It's not the shame without Mama.
888000	890000	Cheer up, Moomin.
890000	892000	You can have this fish.
892000	896000	And I'll come up to Moomin house and cook it especially for you, if you like.
896000	900000	Thanks, Snuffkin. But there are two cooks there already.
900000	902000	Little Mayan's sniff, a bull trying to cook.
902000	905000	A bit of fish, a bit of fat.
905000	911000	This is great. There's lots of delicious things I want to try out.
911000	913000	Where are we, Papa?
913000	918000	No idea, Mama. Too dark to see anything at all.
918000	923000	We've been gone for hours. I think it should have been light by now.
923000	929000	Oh, dear, we have to face it. I'm afraid we're lost. I'm sorry, Mama, but there it is.
929000	931000	What do you mean?
931000	934000	Well, in the dark, we must have wandered into some caves.
934000	939000	Who knows how many different tunnels we took. It could be weeks before we find our way.
944000	947000	Little Mayan's burning.
947000	952000	Mind your own business. I might like burnt food. It's very nutritious. Watch your own cooking.
952000	956000	It couldn't be any worse than the last lot you made for us.
956000	960000	Ha! I wonder where Moomin is. He likes my food. I'll get him to try it.
960000	964000	He can try mine first. Now that I practice, it'll be perfect.
964000	967000	Moomin, I've got something for you.
974000	975000	Mama!
975000	977000	Papa!
1003000	1005000	Mama!
1023000	1025000	What was that?
1033000	1036000	Moomin, Papa! Wake up!
1036000	1038000	Moomin, Papa!
1059000	1061000	Ooh!
1063000	1068000	It tastes brackish. We must be quite near the sea.
1093000	1095000	That's a big one.
1099000	1101000	Gotcha.
1103000	1107000	Moomin, Moomin, where are you so far from home?
1107000	1113000	Mama, at last. Look, I've got a big fish. Come and help me quickly.
1113000	1116000	Don't let it get away.
1124000	1128000	I've never seen such a big fish movement.
1128000	1130000	Just wait till Papa sees it.
1130000	1135000	Oh, yes. Moomin, Papa. This looks familiar. It's Moomin Valley, isn't it?
1135000	1138000	Of course it is, just outside the cave.
1138000	1142000	Oh dear. I'm afraid that your father will be a bit disappointed.
1142000	1144000	Where is he then?
1144000	1149000	Well, he's gone, looking for adventure.
1149000	1151000	Adventure? Where?
1151000	1154000	I don't really know. Somewhere.
1154000	1156000	I could have gone with him.
1156000	1158000	When's he coming home?
1158000	1160000	I'm afraid I don't know that either.
1160000	1163000	You know Papa tonight, tomorrow night.
1163000	1165000	Next Christmas?
1165000	1168000	Your guess is as good as mine, Moomin.
1168000	1172000	Wow. I bet he's having a great adventure right now.
1172000	1174000	Hey, Mama.
1174000	1181000	Oh, oh.
1181000	1185000	Oh, you...
1185000	1188000	Mama?
1188000	1191000	Hello, where are you?
1191000	1196000	Oh, the cave dwellers must have her.
1196000	1199000	Oh, Mama.
1205000	1207000	Mama.
1207000	1209000	Mama, oh.
1209000	1211000	Can you hear me?
1211000	1214000	Oh.
1221000	1224000	Goodness, the sea.
1225000	1229000	Oh, this looks like...
1229000	1232000	Oh, it gets...
1232000	1236000	Oh, dear.
1236000	1241000	Terry, me, I don't...
1241000	1246000	Oh, well, oh, my...
1246000	1249000	Oh, you see?
1249000	1252000	It might have been...
1253000	1257000	Oh, yeah, of course.
1257000	1268000	Oh, look, look, it's Papa.
1268000	1271000	Papa's back, everyone.
1271000	1273000	Uh-huh.
1273000	1276000	Hi, Papa.
1276000	1281000	Oh, well, I'm back.
1281000	1283000	So pleased to see you again.
1283000	1285000	Thank you, Mama.
1285000	1288000	Papa, how was your adventure?
1288000	1290000	Unexpected, yes, that's what I'd say.
1290000	1293000	Unexpected, any food.
1293000	1295000	Oh, yes, you can try mine.
1295000	1296000	First, Moomin, Papa.
1296000	1297000	Oh, mine's the best.
1297000	1298000	Try mine, Papa.
1298000	1299000	Oh, that's good.
1299000	1300000	I'm starving.
1300000	1302000	Tell us about your adventure.
1302000	1303000	I love you.
1303000	1305000	Were you an mortal danger?
1305000	1307000	Did you eat any rams?
1307000	1309000	Yeah, I am supposed to.
1309000	1312000	I think Papa wants to talk about his adventure yet.
1312000	1314000	Maybe later.
1314000	1317000	And that was the end of Mama and Papa's adventure.
1317000	1320000	They didn't get far, but then you don't have to sometimes
1320000	1321000	for things to happen.
1321000	1325000	Or at least for you to think they're happening.
1328000	1330000	They love the laughter,
1330000	1335000	and they love the living, the romance.
1335000	1342000	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1342000	1346000	They're always happy and always at play.
1346000	1350000	The movements are having fun day after day.
1350000	1353000	The movements.
1353000	1357000	The movements.
1357000	1359000	They love the laughter,
1359000	1364000	and they love the living, the movements.
1364000	1371000	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1371000	1375000	They're always happy and always at play.
1375000	1379000	The movements are having fun day after day.
1379000	1382000	The movements.
1382000	1386000	The movements.
1386000	1392000	The movements.
1394000	1399000	The movements.
