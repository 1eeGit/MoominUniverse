WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever.

00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:49.000 --> 00:58.000
there were the movements, there were the movements.

01:19.000 --> 01:32.000
There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

01:49.000 --> 02:09.000
Woman Valley is enjoying another still peaceful summer's day.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
However, this lazy lifestyle, no matter how pleasant it might be, does not suit everyone.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
Oh, yes.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Would you like a cup of coffee, dear?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Yes, I think I need one, Mama.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Oh dear, is it your memoirs?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm stuck.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Ah, can I help?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
How can I create in this?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
In what?

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
In this sleepy atmosphere, and I've also come to a boring part.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
When was that?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
The time I wrote poems.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Were they any good?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
No.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Well, miss that bit out then.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I can't.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
I must put it down for posterity, it is my duty.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
But how can I get inspiration here in this place where nothing ever happens, nothing ever happens at all?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Oh, I think this means another adventure.

03:05.000 --> 03:13.000
Yes, Mama, but I need it to be big, exciting, and frightening.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Mama, what's the matter?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Are you all right?

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Your father says that because nothing ever happens here, he can't write.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
So I'm looking for an adventure for him.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Can you think of anything?

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
He wants it to be big, exciting, and frightening.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Does he want something really exciting?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Yes, dear, I'm afraid so.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I think I could manage that.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
That looks like the footprint of a huge monster.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Oh, it's a good feeling giving others a bit of excitement.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Just a couple more.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
I'm praise the booboo I don't have to do modest work very often.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
Phew, that was harder than I thought.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Oi, sleepy heads.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Wake up, everybody!

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Mom and Papa, quickly get up!

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Mom and Mama, a monster!

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
You've been visited by a monster!

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Wake up before you eat and alive!

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Come on, hurry, hurry!

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
My, what huge tracks.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Ah, that should keep them guessing for a while.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
Hmm, it could be a monster from the depths of the ocean.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Something's not right here.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Don't you think it's a bit odd that it came directly to Moome House?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Yeah.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Well, look at the footsteps. They go in a straight line.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Someone must have told it to go to Moome House.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
And they're only going one way.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Look, there are tiny footsteps going back to the sea.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Oh, Mama, my monster must still be here then.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Oh, well, not necessarily.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Retracing one's own footsteps is the sign of an advanced intelligence.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Stepping back exactly the way you came.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
The tough question is, why would the monster do that?

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
One is led to believe that it wants us to think it's still here.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
Well, in fact, it has gone back to wherever it came from.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Fiddle battle, as my dear mother would say.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
But why would it want us to think that, Papa?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
It's a spy.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Oh, it's a spy.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Something it shouldn't.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
It'd hardly be a good spy if we knew they have to sneak in and out.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
I think it's still here. I can feel it. You know what I mean?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Perhaps tonight.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Tonight? What about tonight?

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
That's when they'll attack. It's gone back to give its report.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
How do you know that, Papa?

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Well, obviously, that's why it still wants us to believe it's here.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Mama, Mama!

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Yes, what is it, Moome?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Something terrible is going to happen.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
A monster is going to attack us tonight.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
And Papa's excited about it.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Oh, good. That's nice for him.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Hurry, everyone.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
I expect the monster will be here soon.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Now hold it still.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
This is going to be a good barricade, don't you think?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
We'd better make sure it's big enough.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
It's hardly any fun at all playing tricks on them. They're so gullible.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
If we catch the monster, we can sell it to a zoo.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I'll handle the sale, of course.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
I'd rather tame it and keep it as a pet.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
We could ride on it to go pig-nicking.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Alright, now for the moat. Here we go.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Hope the well's got enough water in it.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
It'll be able to swim in this, Papa.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
Yes, it'll remind you to the sea and keep it calm.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
This is fresh water, Papa. We'd better put some salt in it.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Good idea, Moome.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
We'll plant some seaweed and put some rocks in too,

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
and then it'll feel really at home.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
I wonder when it'll come.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
I don't know, but I can feel in my bones it'll be tonight.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
And we keep watching till it comes?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Of course we will, constantly.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
What if it doesn't come till tomorrow night or the night after that?

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
It might be a long wait, so we'll take it in turns and remember everybody.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
The safe way is to keep it calm.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
I don't know, but I can feel in my bones it'll be tonight.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
And we keep watching till it comes?

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
We'll take it in turns and remember everybody.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
The safety of Moome in Valley relies upon our vigilance.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
We must be ready.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Look at what those fools have done.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
It was worth all the trouble.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Look, they put down food as bait.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Moome and Papa must be worn out.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Well, I'll take the food anyway.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Carefully, does it?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Don't want to wake up the guard.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
This is great.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
I've managed to play a really good trick on the stupid moments,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
and they've given me a slap-up meal as well.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
The monster's here.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Shut the gate.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
There's the rope.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Quickly!

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
No, the house!

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Wake up everybody to ours!

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
No, it's only me!

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Make room, I'll get it!

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh, where is it?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
There's no monster only me!

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Please, it's me, it's me Stinky!

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Stinky?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Well, it sounds like Stinky.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Be careful everybody, it's a baby monster.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Another monster, please help me!

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I made the footprints!

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
You did?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
He's obviously lying.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
He's too small.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Watch him or he'll go get his daddy.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
No, please, I beg you!

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Ah, Moome and Papa?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Oh, hello, Snuffkin.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Why don't you let Stinky go?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
It really is him, you know.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
It is?

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
Yes, it was Stinky, and he really did make those footprints.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
How do you know that Snuffkin?

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
I was fishing off the shore last night when I saw him digging the holes.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
The little rascal was at it for hours and hours.

10:33.000 --> 10:33.360
The

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Why don't you come inside Stinky?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
This is great.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
It was very good of you to make the footprints.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Papa hasn't had so much fun at ages.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
I'm glad it was hard work and I lost all my hair too.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Well, mischief isn't always easy, you know.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
You can say that again!

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
This is delicious!

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Papa, are you all right?

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Yes, thank you, Moome.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Mama.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Yes, dear?

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Shh, I've got something important to tell you.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
What is it, Papa?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
A secret in my mind is made up.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Of course, dear.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
I'm going to run away on an adventure trip.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
That's nice for you.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
It's a trip without a destination full of mystery,

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
hazards and hardships, and you're coming to, Mama.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Oh, splendid.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
Shall we take all the children or just Moome?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
No, no children.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
That would be the same as here, only somewhere else.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
We'll run away.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Run away, Moome and Papa?

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
I'll be an adventurer again, just as I was in my last youth.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
And with you by my side, we'll have adventure, romance.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
All we desire, the sun, the stars.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
But what about Moonman? He'll be frantic.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Whoa, then it's time he learned to stand on his own feet.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Fan for himself. Become a man.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
We can't protect him forever, you know.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
He's big enough to be left by himself.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I'm on, Mama.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Oh, just a moment, Papa.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Oh, you can't take anything more with us.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
No, I know, but I forgot to write down where the sugar is.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
If they can't find it, they'll just have to do without.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
But then they won't be able to make cakes and the tea will taste awful.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
Oh, and they'll never find this cinnamon on them. Where shall I leave it?

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
Goodness, Mama, cinnamon, I ask you when the unknown is calling to us.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I should have gone on my own, indeed, I should.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
But then what good is an adventure when you can't say who?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
That was a close shave to someone afterwards.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Is there anything wrong, Papa?

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
No, everything is fine, but we must leave before dawn.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
All right.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
We have a long way to go.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
How far and where? It's very dark, you know.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
Yes, isn't it? We'll just follow our feet and they say this way.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
Oh, God.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Good morning, Mama.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Mama, where are you?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
What's the matter, Moomin?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
My parents are missing.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Are you sure? Of course, I'm sure.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
That's a bit of a problem. I'm getting hungry.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
I need my breakfast. I have to start the day with a good meal.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I'm starving. Me too.

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
Don't worry, Moomin. I'm sure that Moomin, Mama and Moomin, Papa will be back home very soon.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
But where could they have gone to, Snuffkin?

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
No idea. Have they left a note?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Have you had your breakfast yet, Moomin?

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
No, nothing. It's not the shame without Mama.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Cheer up, Moomin.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
You can have this fish.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
And I'll come up to Moomin house and cook it especially for you, if you like.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
Thanks, Snuffkin. But there are two cooks there already.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Little Mayan's sniff, a bull trying to cook.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
A bit of fish, a bit of fat.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
This is great. There's lots of delicious things I want to try out.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Where are we, Papa?

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
No idea, Mama. Too dark to see anything at all.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
We've been gone for hours. I think it should have been light by now.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
Oh, dear, we have to face it. I'm afraid we're lost. I'm sorry, Mama, but there it is.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
What do you mean?

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Well, in the dark, we must have wandered into some caves.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
Who knows how many different tunnels we took. It could be weeks before we find our way.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Little Mayan's burning.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
Mind your own business. I might like burnt food. It's very nutritious. Watch your own cooking.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
It couldn't be any worse than the last lot you made for us.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
Ha! I wonder where Moomin is. He likes my food. I'll get him to try it.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
He can try mine first. Now that I practice, it'll be perfect.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
Moomin, I've got something for you.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Mama!

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Papa!

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Mama!

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
What was that?

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Moomin, Papa! Wake up!

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Moomin, Papa!

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Ooh!

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
It tastes brackish. We must be quite near the sea.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
That's a big one.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Gotcha.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
Moomin, Moomin, where are you so far from home?

18:27.000 --> 18:33.000
Mama, at last. Look, I've got a big fish. Come and help me quickly.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Don't let it get away.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
I've never seen such a big fish movement.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Just wait till Papa sees it.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
Oh, yes. Moomin, Papa. This looks familiar. It's Moomin Valley, isn't it?

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Of course it is, just outside the cave.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
Oh dear. I'm afraid that your father will be a bit disappointed.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Where is he then?

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
Well, he's gone, looking for adventure.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Adventure? Where?

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
I don't really know. Somewhere.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I could have gone with him.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
When's he coming home?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I'm afraid I don't know that either.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
You know Papa tonight, tomorrow night.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Next Christmas?

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Your guess is as good as mine, Moomin.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
Wow. I bet he's having a great adventure right now.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Hey, Mama.

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
Oh, oh.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
Oh, you...

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
Mama?

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Hello, where are you?

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
Oh, the cave dwellers must have her.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Oh, Mama.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Mama.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Mama, oh.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Can you hear me?

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Oh.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
Goodness, the sea.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
Oh, this looks like...

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Oh, it gets...

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
Oh, dear.

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
Terry, me, I don't...

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
Oh, well, oh, my...

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Oh, you see?

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
It might have been...

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
Oh, yeah, of course.

20:57.000 --> 21:08.000
Oh, look, look, it's Papa.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Papa's back, everyone.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Uh-huh.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Hi, Papa.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
Oh, well, I'm back.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
So pleased to see you again.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Thank you, Mama.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Papa, how was your adventure?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Unexpected, yes, that's what I'd say.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
Unexpected, any food.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Oh, yes, you can try mine.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
First, Moomin, Papa.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Oh, mine's the best.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Try mine, Papa.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Oh, that's good.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
I'm starving.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Tell us about your adventure.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
I love you.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Were you an mortal danger?

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Did you eat any rams?

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah, I am supposed to.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
I think Papa wants to talk about his adventure yet.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Maybe later.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
And that was the end of Mama and Papa's adventure.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
They didn't get far, but then you don't have to sometimes

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
for things to happen.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
Or at least for you to think they're happening.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
They love the laughter,

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
and they love the living, the romance.

22:15.000 --> 22:22.000
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
They're always happy and always at play.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
The movements.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
The movements.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
They love the laughter,

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
and they love the living, the movements.

22:44.000 --> 22:51.000
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
They're always happy and always at play.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
The movements.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
The movements.

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
The movements.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
The movements.
