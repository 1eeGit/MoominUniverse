    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:30.000
They are the movements, there are the movements,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.439
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just

00:00:37.439 --> 00:01:47.000

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Oops!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Sign on my mama!

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We weren't looking where we were going.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
That's all right. Oops! Sign on my mama! We weren't looking where we were going.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
That's all right.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Here's your bag.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Thank you, thingamy.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Are you going out?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Yes, for a walk.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We'll have fun.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.759
It seems that thingamy and Bob are well and truly part of movement house now.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:31.340
Luckily they don't eat a lot and are small enough to find the pencils that fall between

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.840
the floorboards in the porch.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.840
Hey, this looks like a great hiding place.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.840
Nobody would ever find it here.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.000
Come on Bob, let's go get the suitcase, then.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Are you sure it's not safe for an alarm?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
What would you say if someone went in when we went there?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You wouldn't like it, would you?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I think the movements are much too nice to do anything like that.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.599
It's not them. It's the guests I'm thinking about.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.599
You know the movements let anybody stay.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.400
Snork Maiden.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.639
You lied to me little Mai.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.840
Who me?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.319
Moments still house the shell that I gave him,

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.319
but you said that he didn't.

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.560
Impossible.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.639
Mom and Mama gave it to the groke.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.439
I was there when she did it.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.680
Look, I saw it.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.120
He showed it to me.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.479
Are you really sure?

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:31.819
Was it the same one?

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.000
Of course it was.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.800
I'm not stupid, you know.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.259
That's very odd.

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.719
I saw her do it with my own eyes.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:42.120
Well, I'll go and ask Moomin' right now, little my.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.680
It's a bit awkward, but if I'm going to be honest,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.319
Snork Maiden, what?

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.479
Well, I've decided that from now on,

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.439
I'm only gonna tell the truth.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.280
Oh yes.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.000
And I found something you might be interested in.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.400
Well, what is it?

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.360
Mungle and I were down on the beach yesterday,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.719
and you remember all those things

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.400
we found washed up by the storm?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.840
Do you mean on the Hattie Fatter's island

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.840
that we sailed to?

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.780
Yes, and do you remember the figurehead

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.580
that Moomin liked best of all?

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.580
You know, the lady made of wood and painted.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.979
She was really lovely, wasn't she?

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:16.379
Yes, I remember.

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:17.980
Moomin wanted to keep it.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.220
So what about it?

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.819
Well, it's here on the beach.

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:26.319
It was still the same as beautiful as ever. Was it the same one?

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:28.319
Yes, I remember her pretty face.

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:29.839
No legs, though.

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:31.800
She's just a silly wooden doll.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.079
Oh, I know that, but she's got those gorgeous eyes in lovely long hair.

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:40.360
Little my why all this fuss about this silly figurehead.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.560
Trust him, only someone as stupid as Moonwin could fall in love with a figurehead.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.319
It's probably still dreaming about her every night.

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:49.079
Do you think it's still there?

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:52.519
Jaros Nork Maiden, if no one else has found her already.

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:55.879
Do you think the ocean might come and wash her away again?

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.759
Why all these silly questions, Snork Maiden?

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.879
Moonwin would go and rescue her if he knew.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:02.879
So?

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:04.279
That would be terrible.

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:06.000
I couldn't bear it at all.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I really couldn't.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.439
How pathetic.

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:14.279
He'll probably take her home and keep her in his room forever.

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.560
My expect she's too big to go through the door.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.120
He'll just sit and stare at her with that lovesick look

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.879
on his face.

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.120
I know he will.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.800
Oh!

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.040
Where are you going now?

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.000
I thought you were going to a moment house!

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I was, but there's something more important I have to do!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Okay, it's Chris!

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Hey you two, you're not leaving, are you? No, we're just, uh, we're going. Why have you got the suitcase, then? Look, women, would you help us with something?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Of course.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Thank you very much, women.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Oh, that's okay.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It's a bit too big for you to carry.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
We can take it from here.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
It's all right.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
It's not too big.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It's not too big. It's a bit too big for you to carry.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
We can take it from here.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It's all right. It's not very heavy.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Oh, silly me. It wouldn't be a very secret place if I'd seen it. Would it?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I'll see you later. Don't be too long now.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I'm sorry, won't tell anyone, will ya?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Of course I won't.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
H-h-h-h. Ooooooh.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Ooooooh.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Ooooooh.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Ooooooh.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Hey!

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
What are you doing up there, little my?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I'm coming down.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
What does it look like?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
You're much too small to do that.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
The rungs are too far apart for you to reach.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Just you watch me!

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Mumin, I have a problem.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Do you mind if I ask you something?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Go ahead.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Did Mum and Mama give Snorkman's heart shape shell to the grove?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Yes, she did.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So you and the grove can't both have it, can you?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
That's just where you're wrong.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
But that's simply impossible. You can't have.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
The grove simply got another one.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
That's not true.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
All right, but it would only upset Snork,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
made him if she knew.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
So I'm not going to tell her.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
You rotten thing.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Why don't you just tell me the truth?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Because it's a secret.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
But I want to know, Moomin!

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Look, Moomin!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Now, why don't you tell me your secret

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and then I'll tell you mine?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
What is it?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.079
Really very top secret. Go on then, tell me. secret and then I'll tell you mine. What is it? Really very top secret.

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:47.519
Go on then tell me.

00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:49.920
Tell me yours first.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.319
No, you tell me first.

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:54.439
I know, let's say them together.

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:57.079
All right, ready?

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:58.720
One, two, three.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.319
After we go and show them to the beach,

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:01.560
I'd be right over there.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.560
We'll find something they can do.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.399
Please, so I'll make the bigger head.

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:05.000
Play with the other one just like it., so I'll have the bigger head for that one.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Just like it.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.500
What did you say? The figure head?

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.000
Yes, by the K.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Wait a minute. You didn't finish telling me your secret.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I'll tell you later.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:44.000
That's not there. You've got to tell me now! What do you think, Moments, do you want?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I don't know. Maybe he's looking for shells again.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I don't think so. He looks a bit worried to me.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Maybe he's lost something important.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
How much further do we have to go?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
As far as you can road.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
We're a long way out already, you know.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I want to make sure that the lady will never turn up again.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
We must go further out.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
We must be far enough by now. I'm tired.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:25.000
No! The curds could still drag her in from here. Keep going! He looks very unhappy. We've got to cheer him up. But how?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
He's only one way, Bob.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Yes, you're right, thingamy.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Hello?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Look so sad, moment.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
That we thought we turned out to be a little bit more sad.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
But I'm not sure if you're going to be happy.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I'm not sure if you're going to be happy.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
I'm not sure if you're going to be happy. Hello. Look so sad, Moment. But we thought we'd try and make you happy again.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
You don't mind, do you?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
No, but you don't have to.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I'm alright, really.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
How about this, then, Moment?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
We can show you what's in our suitcase.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Cool.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Would you like that moment?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It's very interesting.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I'm sure you'll like it.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I'm sure you'll like it.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I'm sure you'll like it. I'm sure you'll like it. I'm sure you'll like it. I'm sure you'll like it. I'm sure you'll like it. How about this, Dan Norman? We can show you what's in our suitcase.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Would you like that moment? It's very interesting.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Oh my gosh! Will you?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Uh-huh.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Do you need some help in there?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
No, I think we can manage. Uh-oh!

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Thank you, woman!

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Now we'll open it.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Yes, now. One, two, three.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
One, two, three.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Oh, gosh!

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
By my tail.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Do you like it?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Oh, boy, do I like it? Then you're not sad anymore, woman. Gosh, by my tail.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Dear Leica! Oh boy, do I like it then you're not sad anymore, man?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Oh no! That's good, isn't it?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Yes, very good!

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It was such a beautiful ruby!

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.759
How it changed color from soft red to soft blue

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:06.919
and then to pink?

00:11:06.919 --> 00:11:09.759
One minute it was like a flame leaping out of the center.

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:12.080
Then suddenly it was like a black tulip.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.919
It was...

00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:15.279
Hmm, perhaps that's the King's Ruby.

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:18.720
It was just beautiful.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.120
That's the one the hobgoblin' is searching for.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.679
Oh, no.

00:11:22.679 --> 00:11:27.000
However far away he is, he'll come back on his black panther, looking for it.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.600
And he's sure to find it, because he'll know that thing of me and Bob have it.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.000
First the Groke and allow the hobgoblin. What are we going to do?

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:46.000
No more than a week later, and like a bolt from the blue, a real catastrophe hit Mumen Valley.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
No, it's not in the bedroom either.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Oh, that's very odd. Where did you see it last?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I'm sure it was here somewhere, Papa.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Oh, well, perhaps it's in the garden.

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:09.399
No, I haven't been out here all day.

00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:11.519
Moomin' Mama's handbag is missing.

00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:15.639
Full of useful things like socks and sweets and string.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.759
What's the matter, Mama?

00:12:20.759 --> 00:12:23.480
I can't find my handbag and I'm lost without it.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.679
We've looked everywhere.

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:27.840
Will I get a reward if I find it, Moomin' Mama? I can't find my handbag and I'm lost without it. We've looked everywhere. Will I get a reward if I find it, Mom and Mama?

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:33.399
Yes, we'll have a big party for everyone with cakes, jelly, and everything.

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:37.039
And as a special treat, no one has to wash or go to bed early.

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:38.039
I'll find it, Mama.

00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:40.039
No, I will.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Mom and Mama, I've checked the cellar. It's not there. Oh, dear, where could it be? I haven't been in the cellar for days, so I didn't think it would be there,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
but thank you, dear Snork.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Word got round movement valley of the missing handbag.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I'm not going to be there.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I'm not going to be there.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I'm not going to be there.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I'm not going to be there.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I'm not going to be there.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I'm not going to be there. I'm not going to be there. Where'd got round, Moon Valley of the missing handbag?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And soon everyone was helping to look for it.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
What a lot of people!

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I would do what they're looking for.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
What's everybody looking for? My handbag, thingamy.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
The one with the two nice little pockets?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.559
Yes, that's the one.

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:30.120
It's been missing for days.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.000
Will you two help us look?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:47.000
It needs such a lovely place to sleep and don't you think?

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Woman, mama looks very sad.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Perhaps we better give it back. Oh, you found it!

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Look, everybody, think of me and Bob have found it!

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Oh, thank you!

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Where on earth did you find it?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
In the bush under the water.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Oh, you found it! Look, everybody! Think of me and Bob have found it! Oh, thank you! Where on earth did you find it? In the bush under the white birch tree.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
It's a very, very nice handbag!

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Let's have a party tonight to celebrate the return of Mama's Handbag.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
As you all know, this party is in honor of thing of he and Bob,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
finding movement Mama's Handbag,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.960
and to thank everyone who took part in the big circle. As you all know, this party is in honor of Thingamy and Bob finding Mumin Mama's handbag

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.080
and to thank everyone who took part in the big search.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:56.240
Let's raise our glasses to our heroes, just to Thingamy and Bob, who found Mumin Mama's

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.480
handbag without which Mumin Valley would never be the same again.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:14.000
Cheers! Now I think moment would like to say a few words, moment.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
We're very pleased that Mom is handbagged back again.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And thank you to our Northern friends, Thingamian Bob.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
You're seeing as how this is a very special occasion

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.919
and also as a thank you for the party,

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:28.720
they have decided to show us what is in their suitcase,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.159
and I'm sure you'll all be astounded by what you see.

00:15:31.159 --> 00:15:32.320
Ha!

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.600
Come closer, everyone.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.559
Now, sing a me and Bob. Are you ready?

00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:42.960
Ready, everyone?

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.980
Ready, everyone?

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.000
One, two, three! Ooh!

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
How wonderful!

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I don't know how the globe could swap that for an old seashell!

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:06.000
By my, that must be the King's Ruby. I found it. It's a hand-dumbing!

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Yes!

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
This is it.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
The Ruby I've sworn to find.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Huh?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I found it.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
The King's Ruby.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
I found it.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
It's a hand-dumbing!

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Yes!

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Yes! This is it. It's the Hub Goblin!

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Yes, this is it. The Ruby I've sworn to find. Huh? Don't touch it! It's ours!

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Go away, you nasty Hub Goblin!

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
But that King's Ruby belongs only to me!

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
No, it doesn't. The Groke gave it to sing a me and Bob in fear exchange for a heart-shaped shell, Mr. Hub Goblin.

00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:48.960
Did he say a heart-shaped shell? I think so.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.559
Anyway, I saw her give it to them with my own eyes.

00:16:52.559 --> 00:16:55.080
So it belongs to them, not you.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:00.440
I've spent 300 years day and night searching everywhere for this ruby.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.000
Well, that's very sad, but it still is.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Now then, let's see. Would you exchange the ruby for say to diamond mines?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
No! We don't mind anything now!

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
No. I can't do it. I can't take it by force.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
It's been so long. What can I do?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Would you like some punch? It's very nice.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
That's very kind of you, woman, mama.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I haven't had any for 85 years.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Ah, quince.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
That's part of it, Mr. Hobgoblin.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Have some more, please.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
No, thank you. Hobgoblins don't really drink very much.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Well, this is a splendid bunch and a splendid party. Have some more, please. No, thank you. Hobgoblins don't really drink very much.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.680
Well, this is a splendid punch and a splendid party.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.440
In return, I shall show you a little magic.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.920
I will give out three presents.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.319
Now what I can do is grant three wishes,

00:18:17.319 --> 00:18:21.720
so I want three of you to come forward and make a wish.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.559
You're not afraid, are you?

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.240
How you look old enough not to be frightened, Mr. Emulan? Just let me think.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.240
Oh, yes, Mr. Hobb Goblin. I broke the spade I borrowed from Mum and Papa.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.640
No, Mr. Himmelan, have you ever make a proper wish?

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.279
I would like a new spade, if you please.

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:45.000
Very well, here you are.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Hobb-Coblin.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Here you are, a moment, Papa.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Right, who's next?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Excuse me?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Yes, and what can I do for you, young lady?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Well, I'm afraid it might be a little difficult.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.839
For me?

00:19:07.839 --> 00:19:09.960
Is that really what you want?

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.839
Please.

00:19:10.839 --> 00:19:12.920
All right, then close your eyes.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.160
Your wish has now come true, young lady.

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:20.359
Oh.

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:21.559
Oh, snork, mate.

00:19:21.559 --> 00:19:23.039
Oh, snork, mate, El.

00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:27.599
I've wanted eyes like that wouldn't lay to you think it's so beautiful.

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:30.400
Do you think I'm beautiful now, Mumann?

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.000
Well, I, well, um, give me a mirror, someone.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
They're quite nice, really.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Huh? Huh?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
This is horrible, horrible!

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Please, Mr. Hobgoblin, please give me my eyes back!

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
I'm sorry, but I can only grant one wish per person.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Oh, that's really me! No, please!

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Mr. Hobgoblin, can I make a wish now?

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.500
Certainly. A golden chariot, a rock crystal goblet, anything at all.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:13.099
A sack full of gold coins, you can be rich, Moomin, really rich.

00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:15.599
I'm sorry, but Moomin's is the last wish.

00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:19.000
I know, why don't you ask for two sackfuls of gold, Moomin?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.500
Then we can have one each, what do you think?

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.099
No, Sniff, I know what I'm going to wish.

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:25.000
Oh man. Mr. Hobb Goblin, please change Sn I know what I'm going to wish. Oh, man.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Mr. Hubgublin, please change Snork Maiden's eyes back to her own.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Never mind her, she can see all right. Get the gold coins.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
The wish is made and fulfilled.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
There you are. Have a look.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Oh!

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Now next time, think before you make a wish.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Moments.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Mr. Howe Goblin?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Yes, think of me.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
If you regret wishes like that, why don't you make a wish for yourself?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
I'm afraid my magic only works for other people.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.839
Mr. Howe Goblin, can we make a wish for you then?

00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:07.039
Please, here we can't.

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:07.539
Please.

00:21:07.539 --> 00:21:08.940
I suppose so.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:09.839
Oh, please.

Very well, as it is not for you.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.140
We wish for a movie just like yours.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.380
You shall have it.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
