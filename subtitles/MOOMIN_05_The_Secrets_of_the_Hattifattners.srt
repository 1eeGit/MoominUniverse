00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,800
me here for you on your TV they are the moments they are the moments so come

3
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,600
with me give me your hand I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,040
like a bird sing the best song ever there were the moments there were the

5
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:58,180
moments there was the moments there was the moments there was the moments

6
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:45,040
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:57,920
la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la lㅋㅋㅋㅋ

8
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,840
papa, I think that rope is getting loose. Okay momen, you'd better have a look before this wind has the whole tent down.

9
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,560
me yes captain

10
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,560
The sudden storm has hit the hafifat in his island.

11
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,560
Moomin Papa has decided that it would be far safer to stay the night on the island,

12
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,560
so they put up the tent and moored the boat.

13
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
This will show us what the weather's up to.

14
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
That's as long as it's still working.

15
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,560
I'm sure it's going to die down really soon.

16
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,560
Oh, wake up, Mr. Hemelon.

17
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,560
When the storm clears, we must give this barometer straight back to the hafifatness.

18
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Oh, I quite fancy keeping it myself to remind me of the island.

19
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,560
You know, it seems to work after all.

20
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,560
But Mr. Hemelon, that'll only remind you of the horrible hafifatness.

21
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
What about all the tons of plants you've found?

22
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,560
That surely is going to be enough?

23
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,560
Yes, I know, but there was only really one special flower amongst all those plants,

24
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
and I nearly missed that one.

25
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,560
Look, isn't it a beauty?

26
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,560
I discovered it as I was about to tie up the boat.

27
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Oh, Moomin Papa.

28
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Yes, Mr. Hemelon.

29
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,560
You know when you all went to put up the tent, you told me to tie up the boat so she was safe.

30
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
Yes, of course.

31
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Well, I'm not sure if I did.

32
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Not sure at all.

33
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,560
Please try to remember Mr. Hemelon.

34
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,560
I can't, it's all very unclear in my mind.

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,560
If the boat's not here, we'll be stuck on the island forever and ever.

36
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Well, we pulled it well ashore so it should be okay, but we'd better check on it as soon as we can.

37
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
I'll go have a look.

38
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Quickly, Moomin, be careful.

39
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,560
I remember I was just going to do it when I spotted this flower.

40
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Just by a rocket was whole dear.

41
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
Moomin.

42
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Boy, that was close.

43
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,560
Tie it to the tree and make sure it's tight.

44
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Oh, that should do it.

45
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Just in time.

46
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,560
You know the waves must have been huge to reach this far.

47
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Well, we saved the boat.

48
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Yes.

49
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Well, this storm will be over soon.

50
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
Is everything okay?

51
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Yep, everything's fine.

52
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Oh, thank goodness, so we're not stranded after all.

53
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,560
Huh? No.

54
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
We needn't have worried.

55
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,560
I'm very sorry, really I am.

56
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Are you alright, Snort Maiden?

57
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Now I am.

58
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:31,560
According to this, the storm is blowing over now and it should stop raining soon.

59
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Well, the wind seems to have dropped.

60
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,560
Oh, good. All that thunder and lightning is so noisy.

61
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Ah, right. I think I'll just go for a bit of a walk before I settle down for the night.

62
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,560
But it's much too dark to see anything.

63
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,560
The fresh air will do me good.

64
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Oh, that's a good idea.

65
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,560
I could do with some fresh air myself.

66
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Wait for me. I'll come too.

67
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Let me increase the water.

68
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,560
There's still there hundreds of them all glowing.

69
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
The Hattie Fat News.

70
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
They're waiting for us.

71
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:20,560
The lightning must have recharged them.

72
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Look at them all. I wonder what they want, Snort Maiden.

73
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Such a heavy storm would have given them lots and lots of energy.

74
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Gosh, they're ready for anything.

75
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,560
They're not coming any closer.

76
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,560
They seem fairly friendly. Maybe they just want to see what we look like.

77
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
No, I know what they're here for.

78
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Oh, what's that, Snuffkin?

79
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
It's their barometer, Moomin Papa.

80
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,560
They know we've got it and they've come to get it back from us.

81
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Yes, I think you're right, Snuffkin.

82
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Mr. Hamilton?

83
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,560
I do think you'd better give it back to them.

84
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
Do I have to?

85
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:06,560
Yes, of course. After all it is there isn't there are a lot of them.

86
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Look, why don't you take it out to them now?

87
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,560
You know the barometer does belong to the Mr. Hamilton.

88
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Oh, dear, dear.

89
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,560
Give it to me.

90
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Let me do it, Papa.

91
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Well done, my boy.

92
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,560
You must be careful, my dear.

93
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Don't worry, Mama.

94
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,560
Boy, isn't he brave?

95
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,560
I think this is what you've come for.

96
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Here you are. You can have it back now.

97
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Moomin!

98
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Moomin! Are you all right, Moomin?

99
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
I'll tell you something.

100
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,560
I'm real glad there's no electricity where we live.

101
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Oh, they didn't hurt you, did they?

102
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Ah! Go away!

103
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
They were alone.

104
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Are you all right, Moomin?

105
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
I'll tell you something.

106
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,560
I'm real glad there's no electricity where we live.

107
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Oh, they didn't hurt you, did they?

108
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,400
Are you all right, Snorgmaiden?

109
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,760
What did he do to you?

110
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,200
Just a bit of shock, that's all.

111
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,880
What's that funny smell?

112
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
Huh.

113
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,080
Oh my god, it's your hair.

114
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
What?

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,240
What do you mean?

116
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,760
What's happened to it?

117
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,720
Oh no, my hair.

118
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,520
Mama, mama!

119
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,760
Where's your mirror?

120
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,640
Oh, mama.

121
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,360
Oh, look at what those wicked, hatty fat nurse have done.

122
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,080
It's here in my handbag somewhere.

123
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,280
Hurry, mama!

124
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,560
I must see what's happened to my hair.

125
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,800
Here you are, dear.

126
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,440
Look at me!

127
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,840
Look at me!

128
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,040
It's awful!

129
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
It's horrible!

130
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,600
It's horrible!

131
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,840
Don't worry, we'll put some magic ointment on

132
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,000
and it'll come back all lovely and curly.

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,520
I don't want nasty curly hair.

134
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,280
I want my long, beautiful hair like it was before.

135
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

136
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,280
Do you know it really doesn't matter to me, Snort Major?

137
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

138
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,520
Gun.

139
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,360
Oh, good.

140
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,680
I hope that's the last we see of them.

141
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,440
Oh dear, what's happened to Snort Major?

142
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:26,440
My hair, my hair, where's my hair?

143
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,440
My hair, my hair, where's my hair?

144
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:06,440
My hair, my hair.

145
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Wake up, woman. We got hurry.

146
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,440
My wonder where they're going.

147
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Perhaps they're sailing away to a secret island.

148
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Somewhere very far away from here where they can live happily on their own together.

149
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Gosh, napkin, they're really weird.

150
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Well, it depends on how you look at a woman.

151
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:25,440
They probably think we're a bit strange, too.

152
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,440
Snuffkin, you're really horrible. You knew I wanted to see them.

153
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Come on, you were fast asleep snoring your head off.

154
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,440
That wasn't me snoring. That was Mr. Himulin.

155
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,440
All right. If you say so.

156
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Well, I hope that's the last I'll see of them.

157
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Me, too. That's a very pretty scarf snort made of.

158
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Yes, it is, isn't it?

159
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
Can we go exploring, Mama?

160
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
I don't see why not.

161
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,440
It looks as though it'll be a nice day,

162
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,440
and there'll be lots of exciting things washed up by the storm.

163
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Oh, that'll be fun. Let's look for the other side of the island.

164
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,440
What a good idea. I might discover some more plants.

165
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Mr. Himulin, hurry up, sir, or it will be dark before we get there.

166
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Ah, you go on, Momen. I just want to have a better look at these flowers.

167
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,440
Yes, all right.

168
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,440
Very interesting.

169
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Just think.

170
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Very interesting.

171
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,440
Just think. We could find all sorts of things lying on the sand.

172
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,440
I hope in secret, sunken treasure.

173
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Well, let's hope it's not sunken anymore.

174
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,440
I expect there'll be lots and lots of treasures from shipwrecks and things like that.

175
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,440
But I find it before you.

176
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,440
Oh, no, you won't.

177
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Look at all this. It's all mine.

178
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,440
I'm going to dive in.

179
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,440
What's that over there?

180
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,440
It's quite shallow right here.

181
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Well, there must be something admit it.

182
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Oh, dear, it's empty.

183
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,440
I think I found something here.

184
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Little lie, little lie.

185
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
What's a matter?

186
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Come and see these beautiful shells I have.

187
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,440
I'm too busy hunting for treasure to bother with shells.

188
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,440
Hey, what's this?

189
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Oh, look at this one.

190
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
I've got a real collection here.

191
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Lovely and mama's garden.

192
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Wow, watch that.

193
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
What?

194
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,440
I can't find any as nice as yours.

195
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Don't be in such an awful hurry, little lie.

196
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Snark maiden!

197
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Snark maiden! Look! Look what I found.

198
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,440
A proper treasure.

199
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Look!

200
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Oh, there's snow inside of it.

201
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,440
I found it in a cave.

202
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,440
What is it?

203
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
What's this?

204
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,440
It's a ship telescope.

205
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,440
You can see for miles with it.

206
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,440
I'll give it to Papa.

207
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,440
It's better than anything I got.

208
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Hey, everybody, I found something.

209
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Come on up and have a look.

210
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,440
I wish I could find something interesting.

211
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,440
Have you found some buried treasure?

212
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,440
What a big lady. Is she dead?

213
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
It's made of wood, Snark maiden.

214
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,440
It's a figurehead from a ship.

215
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,440
She's like a queen.

216
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Ha, she hasn't got any legs, though.

217
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Why don't we put her on the front of our boat?

218
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,440
Nah, it's much too heavy.

219
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,440
It must have come from a ship that was wrecked.

220
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,440
And sank and sea?

221
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Perhaps it did.

222
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
And all hands were lost.

223
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,440
I want to take it home.

224
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
What would you do with it?

225
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,440
Use it to frighten people away.

226
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,440
Help! Somebody help me, please!

227
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
That's old, Mr. Hamilton.

228
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,440
Gosh, I hope it's not more haddy fattiners.

229
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Someone help, please!

230
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,440
We're coming!

231
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,440
Woman, why do you like this old figurehead so much?

232
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,440
You're staring at her.

233
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,440
She's not all that special, you know?

234
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Yes, I know.

235
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,440
She's not even real. Only made of wood.

236
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Ah.

237
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Do you like her eyes?

238
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Or is it her hair?

239
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Just because I haven't got any?

240
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
Nearly there, just a bit further.

241
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
Come on, snuff it for me.

242
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,440
For her, if you want.

243
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,440
You're very heavy, Mr. Hamilton.

244
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,440
Thank you, snuff kid. You saved my life.

245
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Boy, how'd you end up there, Mr. Hamilton?

246
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,440
One minute, I was looking for plants the next I'd fall and right into that hole.

247
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,440
I think you'd be safe for collecting stamps, Mr. Hamilton.

248
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,440
Oh no, it's not here. Where is it?

249
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
What is it now?

250
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Tell me.

251
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,440
Make a move and preserve me.

252
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,440
Calm down, Mr. Hamilton. Tell me what's the matter?

253
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,440
My sample box, my sample box. Oh my goodness.

254
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,440
You didn't leave it in the hole, did you?

255
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you. Oh dear.

256
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,440
All my precious samples, I'm so silly. Oh, snuff kid.

257
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,440
Oh, snuff kid, would you mind?

258
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,440
Okay, anything for some peace.

259
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,440
Oh dear boy, you are wonderful.

260
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,440
You shall have one of my rarest plants as a reward.

261
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,440
And indeed you shall, I shall choose a magnificent one for you.

262
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Thank you very much, Mr. Hamilton.

263
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
Gosh, your one-room movement is.

264
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Oh, there you are. What have you been up to?

265
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,440
He can't take his eyes off that silly wooden lady.

266
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,440
He just stares at her.

267
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
Really?

268
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,440
I do not. I just think she has a very beautiful face.

269
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Well, woman, now that you're here, I could really do with your help.

270
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
What do you want, snuff kid?

271
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,440
Mr. Hamilton dropped his box of samples down this hole and I'm going to try and get it.

272
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,440
I didn't drop it. I fell in the hole and just forgot it when Stuffkin pulled me out.

273
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
You're a bit absent-minded, Mr. Hamilton.

274
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,440
No, I'm not. I can remember every Latin name of every single plant, you know.

275
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,440
Okay, I'll go down, woman, but you'll have to help me get back up.

276
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
Okay.

277
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,440
I'll help you too. Now be careful. Can you see it yet, Snuffkin?

278
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,440
I'm not down at the bottom yet.

279
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,440
Oh, forgive me. I'm sorry.

280
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,440
I found it.

281
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,440
Wonderful. Tell me, are the plants all right?

282
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,440
You can check them yourself in a minute.

283
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,440
Oh.

284
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
Are you all right, Snuffkin?

285
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,440
Wait a minute. I found something else.

286
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:38,440
Oh, look. There's the boat. It's moment, moment, moment, Papa.

287
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,440
Hello.

288
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
It's gold.

289
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Hello. We've been hunting treasure.

290
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Go and get movement, Papa. I found gold.

291
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,440
Boy, oh, boy, I wonder how much there is.

292
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Moomin, Papa, we'll know.

293
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,440
Well, Moomin, Papa, what should we do with all this beautiful gold?

294
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,440
It would look lovely in the garden, don't you think?

295
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,440
With all the shells that the snorkemaiden found, they'll look over it in amongst the roses.

296
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
What do you think, Mama?

297
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,440
I'm sure they will, Papa.

298
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
I'm sure they will.

299
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Moomin, she's only a stupid, legless doll.

300
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,440
You can have my bowl full of snorkemaiden.

301
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
No, thanks.

302
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Well, I'll look after it for you. I can pretend it's my treasure.

303
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
Oh.

304
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,440
And that was the end of their first adventure in the new boat.

305
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Moomin, Papa, decided that it was much more fun to set off without maps and sea charts.

306
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,440
You never know where you might end up.

307
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,440
They love the laughter and they love the living, the moments.

308
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:21,440
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

309
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,440
They're always happy and always at play.

310
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,440
The movements are having fun day after day.

311
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,440
The movements.

312
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,440
The movements.

313
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:43,440
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

314
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:51,440
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

315
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,440
They're always happy and always at play.

316
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,440
The movements are having fun day after day.

317
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,440
The movements.

318
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,440
The movements.

319
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:12,440
The movements.

320
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,440
The movements.
