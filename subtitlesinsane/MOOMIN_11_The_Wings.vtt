    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Therefore you are your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They are the movements.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, what's the problem?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The movement is not a problem. Here with me, here for you on your TV, they are the movements.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
They are the movements.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So come with me, give me your hand.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'll take you up to a moment land.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You can fly just like a bird.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Sing that song ever.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There were the movements.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
There were the movements. There was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la- Bapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapap Snort maiden is running as if the groke is chasing her. I don't think I've ever seen her run so fast.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I wonder what's the matter? Perhaps something terrible has happened. Mom! Mom!

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Mom!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Mom!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Mom!

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Mom!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Mom!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Mom!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Mom!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Mom!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Mom!

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Mom!

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Mom!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Mom!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Mom!

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Mom!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Mom!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Mom!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Mom!

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Mom!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Mom!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Now come down and tell us what's wrong. My brother's on the cliff and he's about to jump off.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
What snorke?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Are you sure?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
He says nothing will prevent him doing it.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Oh, please.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You must stop him, moment.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Did you say that you wanted me to help you with something snorke-made?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Yes, I want you to stop snorke jumping off the south side of the cliff.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Oh dear, I never thought he was the type.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.240
He says it's a test flight.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.080
Oh.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.400
Now what?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.240
A test flight, did you say?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.199
Snorke made him.

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.280
Do you mean that he's finally finished building

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.039
his flying ship?

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:56.639
No, only the blueprint.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:57.960
At least I think that's all.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.240
He doesn't tell me.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.599
Well, that's a start.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.120
He built a small model of the flying ship's wings,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.240
and they don't look strong enough to carry anyone.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.039
And now he's going to try them out himself

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:10.159
to see if they'll work.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.240
And I know they won't.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.680
They'll break, you know.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.939
Now, wait a minute, Snorkmaden.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.560
Slow down and let me think.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.560
He's made the wings from the blueprint of the flying ship.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.039
Well, his plans are always very accurate.

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:24.000
Oh, Papa, you've got to stop him.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The south side, Papa.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Yes, I know. The highest and steepest one of all.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Oh, Mum and Papa, there must be something we can do.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Yes, I'm sure there is. Right.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Hurry, everybody. There's no time to lose. Come on.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Oh, thank you, Mum and Papa. I'm in power!

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:07.000
No! Go!

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Go!

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Go!

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
A snork? Wait! Wait! Please! Stop! Snork! Don't do it!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Why have you brought everybody here, Snork Maiden?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
They've come to beg you not to do it!

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You're too young and brilliant for such a tragic end!

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Thank the booble we were in time!

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
As a matter of fact, you weren't.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.040
Oh, really?

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.740
It looks very dangerous to me, Snork.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.779
Well, it's not a tall moon in Papa.

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:51.339
I made these wings myself.

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:52.939
They're perfectly balanced.

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:54.939
Well, yes, I'm sure they are.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.339
The blueprints are detailed and precise.

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:59.939
They're quite safe.

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:01.540
Tell me, Snork.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.379
Why did you stop on the edge like that

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:05.000
after running down the slope?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I was measuring the right length from my approach run.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Don't do it, Snork. I don't want to lose my only brother.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Don't make such a fuss, Snork maiden.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Do you really think it's safe?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Of course it is. You don't see birds falling out of the sky, do you?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Well, at least do your test flight just above the ground so that if something happens to go wrong, you won't hurt yourself.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I've already done that from the roof of our house and it worked beautifully.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Did you see him?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
No, I didn't see anything.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Of course you didn't. Do you think I let a wimpy little sister watch me?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
What's that supposed to mean, snork?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.839
Just that I don't want you sticking your big nose into my affairs all the time. I don't like it, and there's nothing to do with you.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.839
Yours is just as big, and I don't want to lose you.

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:50.639
Don't go on about losing me.

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:51.600
Why not?

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:53.279
Come on now, you two.

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.879
Stop it.

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:54.519
Hey!

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:55.720
Oops!

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.839
That was close.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.879
Snort, Maiden. I don't think your brother is going to be stopped.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.759
Oh, dear, oh dear.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.680
You're very brave, Snort.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Hmm, right. Here we go.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
This time it'll be a perfect takeoff.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
It's a long way. Oh look, isn't that Snorke in there?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Where? Where is he? Where is Snorke in?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
You can't see him from there, Snorke. You'll have to come here.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Is it really Snuffkin?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Yes, I'm sure it is. Snuffkin!

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Yeah!

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Baby, here you.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
No, I don't think so.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
All right, here goes!

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Good luck, Snork! Oh.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
He's flying! I... Whoa!

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
We're here!

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:42.000
It's the snork! Mark!

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Look at him flying! It's alright, Snorke, Ma maiden. Your brother's doing fine. Come and see.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
He's done it! He's done it!

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Whoa, I knew he could do it!

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Will so did I, to be honest.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
You, Snark!

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Hello! You, Snark!

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Hello!

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Hey, hey, hey!

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.500
My baby's test flight is a great success! Yeah! Ha-ha!

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.600
Just as I thought he can't fly in wave at the same time!

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:43.100
Interesting!

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.399
That was mean stinky. If I could get him to wave with both arms,

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:52.960
he'd probably fall. Look, we don't want you here stinky. Why don't you just go away?

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.320
I can find lots to do with that machine. If you won't go away, I will.

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:07.559
Well, go on then, Snuffkin. What do I care what you do? Hmm, that would be perfect for robberies.

00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:11.360
The wind seems to be taking him out to sea.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.399
Why doesn't he turn around and come back?

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:17.120
Turning in that thing might not be so easy.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.120
What? Do you mean he can't?

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.039
Well, don't worry Snuffkin, I mean, of course he can.

00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:25.299
Oh, what's this I can't turn on?

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:26.299
Oh!

00:09:28.299 --> 00:09:29.299
Oh!

00:09:29.299 --> 00:09:30.299
Oh!

00:09:30.299 --> 00:09:31.299
Oh!

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:32.299
Oh!

00:09:35.299 --> 00:09:36.299
Oh!

00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:37.299
Oh!

00:09:37.299 --> 00:09:39.299
Oh, he's hit a tree.

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:40.299
Come on, hurry!

00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:40.799
Oh!

00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:41.799
Oh!

00:09:41.799 --> 00:09:42.799
Oh!

00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:43.799
Oh!

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:44.799
Oh!

00:09:44.799 --> 00:10:04.000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Hurry!

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Is he dead? No, he's been knocked out. He looks dead to me anyway.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Where are they?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
What's happened to the wings?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
In the tree.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Ah, he won't want them anymore, so now I can have them.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Now, let me see. So did the test flight go all right? Will someone tell me what happened? Well, it was fine until the very end.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I'm sure that you only need a bit more practice.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Flying isn't the easiest thing to master, you know.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I expect so. Let's hope you don't run out of bandages, though.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Excuse me, snork.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Hmm?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Are you going to use the wings anymore?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I might not. Why?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Oh, well, I'll have them if you don't want them.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I want to fly in the sky too. It looks the most exciting thing I've ever seen.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Oh, please let me have them.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Well, it's not as simple as that moment. They need testing before the design is complete.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:29.679
But I could do that snorkeh. I know I could do it. Please let me have them. Well I suppose I could do with some help. There's a lot to do fetching and

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:34.740
carrying mostly. You haven't said if I can have the wings or not yet snork. Yes you

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.759
can but on one condition. Anything. Well now the blueprints are finished and the

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:44.000
wings are more or less right. I'll need somewhere to build the ship and

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
somewhere to store all the materials

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
so they'll be dry and at hand.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Yes, you will snorke, I can see that.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It doesn't have to be much, just a roof will do,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
or and walls, so that people can't spy on me

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and steal my ideas.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I can do the building myself,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
but I'll need some help, and when it's finished,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
you can have the wings.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.700
Great, I'd love to help you. I'd have done that anyway,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.700
but now that I can have the wings, I'll work twice as hard.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.700
You won't regret it, Snorke. I promise you, you won't.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.700
Splendid, woman. That settled them.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.200
Perhaps we can get more help. I'm sure that'd be easy.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.700
How about it, Snorke?

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.700
Yes, of course.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.000
Will you help us do Sniff? Yes, but I want something too.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I'll let you borrow the wings.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
No, I'm far too heavy. I only break them.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Don't worry, sniff. I'm sure I'll think of something you can have.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Oh, as long as it's something nice.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Oh, I do love helping people.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:13:06.000
You're all heart-sniff. We know always build for posterity.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Besides, I like pouring cement.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Okay, Papa. I've given your present a lot of fortune, oh?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And I think I'll give you one of my invaluable books on machinery.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Don't you want it?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Well, if there was something else, I'm not much of a reader.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.000
What about my invaluable fountain pen? Don't you want it? Well, if there was something else, I'm not much of a reader.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
What about my invaluable fountain pen?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Invaluable fountain pen?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
What about my invaluable...

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Do you have anything that's not invaluable, Snort?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Well, what about a gold coin?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Well, that sounds great! A real gold coin?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Oh boy, yes, that's a deal.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Oh ho ho!

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Uh-oh!

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Uh-oh!

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Uh-oh!

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Uh-oh!

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Uh-oh!

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Uh-oh!

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Uh-oh!

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Uh-oh!

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Uh-oh!

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Uh-oh!

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Uh-oh!

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! You are digging a very deep hole. Uh...

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
You are digging a very deep hole. Why don't you stop and have some sandwiches?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Should we do that, Papa? Go on.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Yes, I think we can stop now.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Sniff and your brother in the woods.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:48.600
Yes, I know. I heard them.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.700
Hi, Snork Maiden.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:54.500
Oh, no.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:57.799
Wait a minute, I want to ask you something. What is it?

00:14:57.799 --> 00:15:01.700
Tell me, Snork Maiden, is it true that your brother gave those wings to a woman?

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.600
Yes, it is.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.000
He's helping Snork to build the shadows payment. I thought they'd been broken up. They hit that tree very hard. Well, my brothers are repairing them.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Will you let me pass? I've got to take his lunch to him.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And will he be able to repair them?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
He can repair anything!

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Mmm.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Gosh! What a lot of wood you've got!

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Well, the shed has to be a lot bigger than my life.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you go. Anything! Mmm!

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Gosh! What a lot of wood you've got!

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Well, the shed has to be a lot bigger than my flying ship!

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Moving and moving proper digging holes, they sure are deep!

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Everybody's being very kind, very kind indeed!

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Mama's cooking and Snuffkin's gone to get nails.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
There are some other things I need him to get as well.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Will you write them down?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Of course I will, Snork.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Oh, you're such a planner.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Well, I'm afraid all famous inventors have to be.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Yep.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Ah. Ugh.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Whether it was Snork's planning, or the fact that everyone in Mumen Valley helped in some way or other,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:46.000
the hangar or boat house was finished in record time. I'm going to go able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. You? Moments here? Come in, Moments.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Thank you for all your help.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
You did so much that these wings are hardly paymented enough.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
But if you're happy with them...

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Oh no, it was great fun building this shed.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I changed the design a bit, so it's easier to take off and land.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And turning shouldn't be a problem anymore.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.319
You must remember to give yourself plenty of time though, woman.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:31.160
Thank you, Snork. I can't wait to try them out.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.440
I'm so excited I don't think I'll sleep tonight.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.319
Are you trying them out tomorrow?

00:17:35.319 --> 00:17:36.599
As soon as I can.

00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:38.720
You will be careful.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.960
You must practice a lot just above the ground to get used to wearing them before you try

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.279
to go too high.

00:17:44.279 --> 00:17:45.039
I don't want anything

00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:57.359
to happen to you. Oh, practice, I promise. Where are you going to practice tomorrow? I haven't decided.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.700
I'll find somewhere when I come out tomorrow. Perhaps on that small hill near the cliff.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.700
Well that can't be too dangerous.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.000
I'll see you there!

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Hey!

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Hey!

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Hey!

00:18:21.000 --> 00:19:00.299
Hey! Rui! Hi, Momen. Where do you put the wings?

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:08.000
On the table outside. You must have gone past them if you came in through the veranda door.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
No, I didn't. They're not there.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
What?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Oh no, you're right. They're gone.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Oh dear, I thought it was my friend.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
What's happened to them?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Somebody stole them!

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
What's the matter with you, too?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Is something wrong?

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Yes, somebody stole and Momen's wings!

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Well, perhaps they haven't been stolen.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Of course they have, and I bet I know who did it, too!

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Come on!

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Where are we going? Do you know where they are?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
It's stinky! Oh, yeah!

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Well, it certainly didn't take you long!

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Just a minute, stinky! Those are my wings!

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
See? I knew it was him!

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Stop your horrible creature! I certainly will, Pat! See? I knew it was him. Oh, stop! Oh, stop! Oh, stop! Oh, stop!

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Here, prosthetic!

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
And the wings are mine!

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I'll become a master criminal now!

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Oh, all rotten saving!

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
You shouldn't have left them outside, moment!

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Yeah, but who'd think let each steal them?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Where his friends, well, almost,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.039
I didn't think even stinky would do something like that! Well, I. Yeah, but who'd think, let each steal them.

00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:46.880
Where his friends, well, almost,

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.880
I didn't think even stinky would do something like that.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.519
Well, he did, didn't he?

00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:53.000
Now, don't worry, moment.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.759
We'll find him and get them back.

00:20:54.759 --> 00:20:56.079
I know it.

00:20:56.079 --> 00:20:57.079
Yeah.

00:21:02.079 --> 00:21:02.880
Look, moment.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.480
Now he's going towards the sea.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, turn around.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
But stinky didn't know how to maneuver the wings.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
It was taken further and further out.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Turn around when you turn back.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Until. I'm too. Ah!

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
You're at least he's having a bath full once. The wings will be badly damaged.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Never mind.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Snark will build another pair.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:46.000
I sure hope so. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
I'm going to have to go.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
I'm going to have to go.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
I'm going to have to go.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
I'm going to have to go.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
I'm going to have to go.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
I'm going to have to go.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
I'm going to have to go.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
I'm going to have to go.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
I'm going to have to go.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:14.000
I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
They're always happy and always at play.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
The movements.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
The movements.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
They love the laughter and they love the living.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:51.519
