00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
There were the movements, there were the movements,

00:46.000 --> 00:59.000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

00:59.000 --> 01:15.000
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
Woman and snorkemaiden were still fast asleep in the row and tree.

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
The sun was high in the sky and the floating theater had floated away a long time ago.

01:28.000 --> 01:39.000
Oh, oh, oh, I feel so good, I really slept like a log all night.

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
It's so lovely to be out in the fresh air with movement and a tree in blue.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
No, no, the house is gone, I mean the theater is gone.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
Woman, wake up, there's been a catastrophe, wake up.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
What's a catastrophe? Look down, the theaters floated off during the night.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
I don't believe it.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
It has, it's gone, I can't see it anywhere.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
It must be far away by now.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Woman, your father's walking stick.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
It must have got loose in the middle of the night while everybody was asleep.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Crying won't solve the problems, don't made him.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
But we're stranded in the row and tree with water all around us.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
Hmm.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
Huh?

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Huh?

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Oh no, we're in a drift, we're floating away!

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
We're drifting away!

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Oh, what are we going to do?

03:21.000 --> 03:26.020
Bull men and snot maintenance are still up in that beautiful Rowan tree. That's just typical

03:26.120 --> 03:29.000
Where is it and how can we have drifted so far away?

03:29.720 --> 03:35.200
Listen last night didn't you I told you never to do that in the iterate brings bad look

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Oh! Little Maya!

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Oh my God!

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Oh, no!

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Oh, no!

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Oh, dear!

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Oh, little Maya!

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Oh, get this hurry!

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
You're so mean!

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Little Maya's drifting off.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Seems we're stranded, and that's not a bad thing.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
The aiders shouldn't swim about like that.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Aren't you scared to get over to your side?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
You must be brave, North Maiden!

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
I'll catch you so you won't fall, okay?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Oh!

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
I told you so, the branch didn't break, did it?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Thank you for saving me!

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
Whoa!

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Ah!

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Ah!

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Are you all right, Moomin?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I can stand up, Snorke Maiden!

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Look, the water's only ankle deep!

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Really?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Ah!

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Are you all right, Snorke Maiden?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Yes, it's so shallow.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Wonder where I'm gonna end up.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Doesn't matter, I rather like this boat.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
I'm gonna make some noise.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I'll go back to sleep for a while.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
It's getting dark, isn't it?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Oh?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Yes, try them!

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Look there!

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
A fire!

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Must be people over there.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Yes!

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
Of course I forgotten tonight's mid-summer eve!

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
What a strange catch!

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
So the Moomin's split up.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Are they in trouble, little Mai?

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Yeah, seems I was probably the luckiest one as usual.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
More!

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
I'm sorry you can't have anymore, that's all I have.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I don't believe you, your bag's still full.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Yes, but not with food, little Mai.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
What's in it then?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
You'll soon find out.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Where are we going?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
To a park.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
I hope there's a hot dog stand there.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Those two over there are the park keeper and his wife.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Look, they're always watching.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
They guard a lot of poor orphans who come to the park every day.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Really?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Look over there!

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Unbelievable!

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Hey, what's this?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Hey kids!

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Come on everybody, we're here to let you out!

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Come quickly, hurry!

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Huh?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
We can't go anywhere.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
We have to sit right here so they can see us.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah, otherwise they might lose one of us.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
What a lot of signs, no walking on grass, no shouting, no running!

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
What a lot of rules!

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Why are they good for a snuffkin?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Nothing.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Nothing at all.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
And that's why we're going to pull them up.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
No, you mustn't.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I don't think one is allowed to do that.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
And you have to walk on the grass.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Yes indeed.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
And I really like walking on the grass.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
I always have.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
No buts.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Come on everybody, let's make a start.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
That looks like fun, I'll pull some too.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
What are you doing?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Can't you read?

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
There's a sign saying it's forbidden to pull a charge.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
This one?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Yeah!

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Oh, oh, oh!

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Oh!

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Oh!

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Oh!

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Oh!

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Oh!

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Oh!

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Oh!

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Oh!

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Oh!

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I'm beautiful sign!

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Oh!

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Bye bye!

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Oh!

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Oh!

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Oh!

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
There you free!

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Go run!

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Okay!

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Stop!

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Wait!

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Oh!

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
What the hell?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Oh!

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
My goodness!

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Those little balls are shining!

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Oh!

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Oh!

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Oh!

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Oh!

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Oh!

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh!

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Quick ride, those were hadipatmosies!

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Come on everybody, run!

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Oh, you got all of here!

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Someone help!

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Someone help!

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
The rest of me!

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Get some!

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Get away!

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Quick!

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
They're terrible!

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Where could that floating theater have gone?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
They're still following us!

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Come on, you kids, you can go wherever you want!

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Do what you like!

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Yeah, but I don't know what I want!

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Me, me, sir!

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
No, me!

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I think they want to go with you, Snuffkin!

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
But I don't know anything about small children.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I'm not sure I even like them!

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
All we have to do is find a theater!

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Mum and Mama will know what to do!

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
In that case, let's go!

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Mum!

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Mum!

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Mum!

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Mum!

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Mum!

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Mum!

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Mum!

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Oh, house!

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Yes, and look!

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
All the lights are on!

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Maybe they're celebrating with some relief!

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Shall we go there?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yes!

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Oh, house!

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Yes, and look!

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
All the lights are on!

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Maybe they're celebrating with some relief!

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Shall we go there?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Yes!

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Oh!

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Oh!

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Oh!

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
At last!

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Oh!

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Hello, happy midsummer!

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Thank you!

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Happy midsummer!

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
What can I do for you?

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Would you have seen a theater drifting around somewhere, ma'am?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
A theater?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Yes, you see it drifted away in the flood, and my powers are on it!

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Oh, dear!

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I haven't seen anything like that!

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Oh, what a pity!

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Thank you!

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
We'll look elsewhere!

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Have a nice midsummer party!

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Party?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Oh, yes, a party!

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Thank you very much!

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Very well, then!

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I'll say goodnight!

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Did we say something wrong, ma'am?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I don't know!

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
What's the matter?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I think she's crying!

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Oh!

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Hello!

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Is there anything we can do, anything at all?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Aren't you having a party, ma'am?

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
No, unfortunately, she's not coming this year either!

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Oh, is she?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
My aunt and my father's side!

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
I invite her every year for a midsummer party, but she never comes!

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
How sad!

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
You must be very fond of her!

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Oh, no! She's an awful person!

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
If that's how you feel about her, why don't you invite someone else?

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
She's my only relative!

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
So invite someone who isn't a relative?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Yes!

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Why don't you invite us, for instance?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Oh!

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Can one really do things like that?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Just like that?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Of course one can!

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Oh, marvelous!

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Don't be perfectly honest!

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
We're very hungry!

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
I've made lots of extra pancakes!

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Please, come in and join me!

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Thank you!

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
Although we have drifted apart tonight, is midsummer's eve?

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
Let's drink a toast to Mum and Snork Maiden and Little Mai

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
and hope that they're safe!

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
And we better drink to that no-good niece of mine, I guess!

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Who's that, Emma?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
My only relative!

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
She lives all alone in a small house by the sea!

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Oh, is she all alone for midsummer?

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
Probably! I always invite me over for pancakes!

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
I don't like relatives, and I don't like pancakes, and she's boring, so I don't go!

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
Well, let's toast her anyway, and here's hoping we'll all be together again very soon!

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Cheers!

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Good health!

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Oh, that was really good!

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Everything was delicious!

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I think I've eaten too much!

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Oh, please have some more!

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Oh, this is so nice!

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
I couldn't eat another thing!

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Oh, sad!

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
It's such fun having someone to cook for!

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
I'm so pleased you're not at my door!

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
All that's missing now is a bonfire!

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
We always have one on midsummer eve!

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
What a good idea! Let's have one!

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Over there!

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Help! Help!

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
So glad you came!

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
See these? The flood brought all of them!

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
They were lying all over the place, so I tied them into one big pile!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Would they make a good bonfire?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Oh, a terrific one!

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Definitely!

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Oh, wow!

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
We've walked for miles, but I can't see signs of a theater anywhere!

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Oh, don't worry! We'll find it soon!

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Huh?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
And what's the matter with you?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
I'm hungry!

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Me too!

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
And me!

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I can't walk anymore!

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
We don't have any food if you want food!

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
You'll have to look for it yourself!

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Oh, don't cry!

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Look over there, little lion!

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
What?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Over there, hidden behind the trees!

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Whoa, I have!

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
And the lights are on!

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
We're safe!

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Oh, look at that!

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
Hey, kids, you can't go eating other people's food!

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
You can if they are home, and it's just what's left over from a party?

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
In fact, I will have some myself!

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
It's amazing! I'm always so lucky!

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Now we must pick nine flowers!

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Why is that Snorke-Middon?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
I don't really know!

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
It's always nine or seven of something!

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Okay, nine flowers!

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
No, not the same kind!

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
You must pick nine different flowers!

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
A memory you do!

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
You turn around, and then you turn around!

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
And then you turn around!

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
And then you turn around!

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
And then you turn around!

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
And then you turn around!

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
And then you turn around!

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
You turn around seven times like this!

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I get it!

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
And then you walk backward until you reach a well!

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
And then, when you look down into the well,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
there you'll see the man you're going to marry!

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
How did I get him up?

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
I think I see him! What a clever well!

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
That I must try!

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I'd like someone more romantic!

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Got you!

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
What are you doing?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I'm quietly now!

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Oh, all we did is pick some unprotected wild flowers!

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I know what you did!

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Hey, Snorke-Middon!

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Moonman!

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Ha! You know each other! That makes it conspiracy!

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
But I tell you, we've done nothing wrong, nothing at all!

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
We were only celebrating!

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Better for you, if you haven't!

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
But why? Can't you light a bonfire here, sir?

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
I must warn you that all you say will be used against you!

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
I have a complaint from the parkkeeper!

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
You pulled up these signs from his park and you burnt them!

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
That's not true!

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
It is true that we burnt them, sir,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
but we didn't take them from any park!

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
They were brought here by the flood!

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Older-dash! Here's the evidence!

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I've caught you when that's that!

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Oh, I caught something!

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Oh, it's just a piece of wood!

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Had any ideas here?

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
Not a single one. How about you, Mama?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Same here, I'm afraid.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I just can't seem to think of anything at all!

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
You wouldn't have any ideas about what we should do next, would you, Emma?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
About what?

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
Some ideas about how to let the children know where we are, of course.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
How does anyone?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
No where a theater is.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
I don't know.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Please tell us.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Well, you put on a play.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
A play?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Yes, that is correct.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
This is a theater, and when you put on a new play,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
everybody comes walking to see it.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
They come to laugh, to cry, to shout, and to applaud.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
And when your children hear of it, they will be hearing a flash.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
What a splendid idea, Emma!

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
That's exactly what we'll do.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I'm sorry, we can't put on a play.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Why not?

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
We have no actors. They are pests, but one can't do without them.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
I can be one.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
And I'm also quite good at acting.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I can act very well.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
There are only three of you, and not one of you, is an experienced professional actor.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Don't forget, we have you, Emma.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Me?

19:51.000 --> 19:57.000
Well, I've always felt that I would make a rather good Shakespearean heroine.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
And we can each have many parts, as long as they're not all on the stage at the same time.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
He isn't at so moment, Papa.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Of course, it's possible to do it.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I want the part that finds the treasure.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
No, that's impossible. We have no play.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Nothing simple enough for the likes of you.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
A moment, Papa, can write one. He's very talented.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
No trouble at all, my dear. Any number of acts.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
But we don't want any number. We want three acts.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
That's what all proper plays always have, moment, Papa.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Let's start right away.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
We got to print posters.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
And clean the stage.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Whatever, if I started.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Aw.

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
And this was how a woman, Papa, got started on a short career as a playwright.

21:00.000 --> 21:12.000
But while the birds carry news of the play far and wide,

21:12.000 --> 21:18.000
what has to become of movement and snorkemaiden?

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
Their troubles are real ones.

21:22.000 --> 21:38.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

21:38.000 --> 21:46.000
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
They're always happy and goes at play.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
The movements.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
The movements.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
The movements.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
The movements.
