WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me,

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land,

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements,

00:43.000 --> 00:58.000
There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

01:28.000 --> 01:58.000
da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

01:58.000 --> 02:00.700
Dan, do you think it's broken, Papa?

02:00.700 --> 02:04.500
Well, I'm not sure. I've not had a great deal of experience with this sort of thing.

02:10.100 --> 02:13.400
Look over there, Moomin. It's the boy and the fisherman from the boat.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.900
They're a bit strange, aren't they?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.900
They must live somewhere here on the island.

02:21.900 --> 02:22.900
Let's see.

02:28.000 --> 02:28.500
What?

02:38.000 --> 02:42.500
Oh, thank you. Leave it by the door when you haven't quite finished yet.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.500
Well, at least we can see the floor now.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I think the keeper must be lying dead under the desk.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Nobody's cleaned here for a long time. That's for sure.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.500
That probably means the lighthouse lamp hasn't been working for ages either.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.500
I wonder if Papa will be able to fix it.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.500
I wonder if they're going to manage to get the light working all right.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.500
Well, the lighthouse without a lamp is pretty sad, isn't it?

03:14.500 --> 03:16.500
Come on, light, will you?

03:16.500 --> 03:18.500
Right, I'll give you one last chance.

03:22.500 --> 03:26.000
Then I'm getting the big spanner. Now you don't know me, but I don't give in easily.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.500
Especially to machines.

03:27.500 --> 03:36.000
Have you thought brass brain what will happen tonight if there's a storm and there's a ship out there looking for land or trying to keep off the rocks and there's no light to guide them?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
You'll be sorry Dan, but it'll be too late.

03:38.000 --> 03:45.500
And all I can say is that if the light hasn't been working for some time that I'm afraid that there could have been many shipwrecks.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.500
Oh, that's awful.

03:46.500 --> 03:50.500
Well, it would be dangerous to come too close to the island without a light to help you.

03:50.500 --> 03:53.000
I wouldn't be surprised if that ghost ship went one of them.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
It all seems very strange, and I wonder what made the lighthouse keeper leave in such a hurry.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Unspeakable horror. Please be quiet, little my.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
It's obvious. Close, thrown above dishes left unwashed, jigsaw puzzles have finished.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
It's an unsolved mystery of the sea, just like the Marie Celeste.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
And if you don't understand that, then you're being even stupider. Then usual.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Oh, dear poor man, I wonder what he was like.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
He must have been very lonely here on his own.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
He scribbled messages over the walls like no side of a ship.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
It's Christmas, another month gone. I must clean the lamp, and I need to talk to someone.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
Oh, well, if he didn't see many ships, at least they could have been many shipwrecks either.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Oh, I hope not, Papa. That would be one good thing anyway.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
Perhaps the sea came and took him on a dark and stormy night, and he was swept out and no one saw him go.

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
That's rubbish, little my. On dark and stormy nights, lighthouse keeper sits safe by a fire drinking hot tea laced with rum.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
He might have run out of rum and gone to get more.

05:02.000 --> 05:09.000
Well, I don't think anything terrible happened to him. He just got more and more lonely and fed up and then went off and got a girlfriend.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
Be careful, snuffkin. It's very rough, but not even, and you don't want to fall into the sea.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
I certainly don't. Now, watch your step. The rocks are very slippery.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Well, are you all right?

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Yes, Lang, so I didn't think they'd be a slippery is all that.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
What's the matter? Look over there. There's something moving, but I can't see what it is.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
It's probably a boat.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
No, that's what I call a real ship.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
It's not a real one.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
What do you mean?

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
It's the ghost ship, the one we saw last night.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
You're right. Why isn't it come back, snuffkin? What does it want?

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
I don't know. Perhaps it followed us to the island and for some reason wants to make contact.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Let's go home, snuffkin. I don't like this.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
What's up?

06:19.000 --> 06:31.000
Oh, no. Shut up. I'm having a great dream, and you can see the view.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
Wait. Oh, it was horrible. Someone stepped on my face.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Well, none of us sleepwalking since we were all asleep. Why don't you just be quiet?

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
They're very odd.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
No, somebody's on my stomach now. Don't be stupid.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
Oh, have a look, snuffkin. There must be something there. Please, snuffkin, please.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
I can't see any. What's that?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
What is it?

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
I don't know yet, movement. I think I can see a pair of feet.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
A pair of feet.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
My legs just feet.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
But that means a ghost.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Oh, help. Get it off me. Go away, go away.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
Let me at them. Where are they? I'll teach them to spoil my dream.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
They're on my face now. Go away, will you?

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
No. Show me it. But no, stamp on it.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Stop it, move away.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
No, it's my fault.

07:37.000 --> 07:47.000
You go fishing again today. No, I'm not.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
Oh, do you need me or is it all right if I go and see those people in the lighthouse?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
No, I don't want you one.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
Okay, goodbye then.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
You mean this room is really haunted?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
It certainly is.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
But we only saw a pair of feet.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
I'll sleep here tonight. Don't worry, I'll protect you.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Are you going to scare it away, Papa?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I can't find any good shells.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
You're me.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
What about this one?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Oh yes, that's lovely.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Go on, take it. I don't collect them.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Who are you?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Well, I'm a ghost, sort of.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Are you the rat who walked over us last night?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
You were lucky I didn't grab you.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Sorry, it wasn't just me. There were a few of us.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Now walk over each other.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Can I give you a present?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
You can't get around me that easily.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
You better show yourselves or you'll be sorry.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
It's just me. The others have all left me and gone off with the ship.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Ha, so why didn't you go with them?

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Oh, I wanted to, but well...

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Come on, out with it.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Well...

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
Never got me and let me all of my own and I was frightened.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
Well, I can see why they wouldn't want a drippy thing like you around.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
You call yourself a ghost.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
I know, I'm sorry.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
I just can't work out what's wrong with it.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Let's try and see what happens here.

09:28.000 --> 09:35.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, heavens, oh my, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Oh, no!

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
You were right, Pop-Up!

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Oh, thank goodness you are here, quick!

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Open all the windows, I'm choking!

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Oh, my God.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
Mmm, this is great. That soup I've had for ages, Moome and Mama.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Would you like some more?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Oh, he has, please.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
Can I have the recipe? I could make some for the fisherman. I know he'd love it.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I'll write it out for you. What's his name?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I don't know. He doesn't say.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
I've come from the north. I left about three months ago,

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
although it seems a lot longer, and I'd been rowing south in my small boat,

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
trying to reach Moome and Valley.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Oh, really? We live there.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Do you? You're lucky. It must be very nice. I've never been there,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
but I've heard that it's beautiful.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Anyway, there was a violent storm in my little boat capsized.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
He rescued me, and I've stayed with him in his cabin ever since.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
And he doesn't talk about himself at all. That's very strange.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
No, but I think he does have a big secret.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
How do you know, Taft?

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
Well, sometimes he just stares and stares at the lighthouse in any sort of size.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
I wonder why.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
I did ask him once, but he glared at me in such a nasty way.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I haven't dared say a word about it since.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
You don't want to stay with him then?

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Oh, yes. Well, most of the time he's really nice to me,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
and since I've been here, I've sort of taken care of him,

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
because you see he doesn't really look after himself.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
Could I have a cup of tea, please, Mama?

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Yes, dear. How is the light coming along?

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Oh, not very well. There's still a few more things I could try, though.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Hello. You were on that boat fishing, weren't you?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Yes, I was. My name is Taft, Mum and Papa.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Oh, please, to meet you.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Is your friend here as well? I wanted to ask him something.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
There's something quite important.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Ask him what?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Well, about this lighthouse for one thing.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Well, he won't talk about that. He just refuses to.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Oh, dear, does he?

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
The thing is, I'm trying to light this beacon, but having no success.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
I wondered whether he might know if there's an easy way of doing it.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
You never know. I might have missed something.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
It's very quiet.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
He might be out fishing, you know.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Come on, let's go.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Where are you going, Moomin?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I want to ask that man some questions.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
He doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who does a lot of talking.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Do you think he might know something about the lighthouse keeper?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
That's what I want to find out.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
Hello. My name is Moomin, and this is my friend, Snuffkin.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
What's your business here?

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
I wonder, do you live here?

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
I suppose you must have met the lighthouse keeper, have you?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I don't want people to have other matters.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
We were just curious about why you left the lighthouse. Do you know why?

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
No, you kept himself to himself.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Oh, so you do know it. When did he leave?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Where did he go? You must know.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Get.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Oh, please. Had the light stopped working before he left?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Why did he leave the door open? Were there any shipwrecks?

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Wait a minute, just one more question, please.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Oh, don't go.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
There's something very important I need to know.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
You're the only other person on the island apart from the ghost ship.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Oh, no, please, come back.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
Look, my father is trying to get the lamp working again, but not getting anywhere.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
So if you know where the keeper is, or better still, how to light it,

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
will you please help?

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
It's not only for us, but for all those ships that might be in danger without it.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Oh.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Moomin.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
I don't think that man knows much about anything.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
Well, at least he's heard you and knows what you want.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Let's go, Moomin.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Moomin.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Look, over there, what's Moomin Papa doing?

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Snort made an a little Maya helping him.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Hiya!

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Come on.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Yeah.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
It's about time. Where are you two being?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
What are you building now?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
We're making a raft.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Why?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Because we wanted to stupid.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Why else would we build it?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Do you like it?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
But why do you want a raft?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
It's not really a raft, is it Papa?

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
Let me present our very own hand-built ghost ship.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
A ghost ship?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
He must be here somewhere.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
Well, if he's the one that walked on me last night,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I want a word with him.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Yes, sorry.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I'm afraid that was me and my friends.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Oh, where are you?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Show us a bit of leg, at least.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I like to see you I'm talking to.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
Yes, all right.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
Oh, well, at least he looks like a ghost.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Thank you.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Ghosts look pretty silly when the sun's shining if you ask me.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Well, it was your idea.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I always thought ghosts were frightening me.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Yes, we forgot our chains last night.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
It's very hard to be ghostly without them.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
We did our best to scare you, though.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
The ghost came to this island because the lighthouse was a bit like an ancient castle.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
We feel more at home in castle.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
And now when they found us here, they changed their minds and gave up.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
That's funny, isn't it?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
What's the matter?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
You look a bit fed up.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
That's because he's been left behind by the other ghosts.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
They've gone off in the ghost ship.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Wow, they didn't tell me they were going straight away.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
And I'd gone to the lighthouse keepers cabin.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
The lighthouse keeper?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Why did you go there?

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Well, I wanted to tell him that some strange people.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
I'm sorry.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
I mean, strangers had moved into the lighthouse and that he'd be better off with us

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
because ghosts don't damage things.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I didn't know you then, of course.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
But some people are very kind.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Where is his cabin?

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Is it easy to find?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
At the southern end of the island.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
But it was a waste of time because he wouldn't talk to me.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
I shouldn't have bothered.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
And then I would have caught the boat.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Anyway, he's not going back to his job.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
So that's that.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Bye-bye.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Thanks again for the raft.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Take care.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
I hope you catch up with your friends real soon.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Thank you.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
You're okay for mortals.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
I promise next time we meet up he rallies, Gary.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Chains and all.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Lots of chains.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
And we promise to be terrified.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
You can come and scare me anytime you want.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Bye-bye.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Relating a charm.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Bye-bye.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
He said anything that could float would do.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
But that raft seemed a bit flimsy to me.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
I wouldn't like to chance it.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
It can be rough out there.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Ghost can't drown.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Can they?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
They're dead already.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Mama.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
What is it, Moomin, dear?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Poppa's gone fishing again.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Well, he's gone fishing again.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Well, he enjoys it.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Well, that's all he seems to do these days.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
He's not working on the lamp at all.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Well, perhaps living in a new place makes him want to do a new thing.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
And he does catch one now and again.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
What are you making, little boy?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
An elevator.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
An elevator?

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Yes, and when that's finished, I'm going to build a house.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Oh, my goodness.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
A house of my very own.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Moomin, Papa, doesn't seem his usual happy self,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
even though he enjoys his fishing.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
He's upset that he couldn't make the lamp work and isn't used to failure,

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
but nothing he tries makes any difference.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
What a pity it would be to leave the island without seeing the beautiful beams

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
shining over the water.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Oh, my goodness.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Oh, my goodness.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Yeah, hey, come and have a look.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Everyone, I finished my house.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
Hey, Moomin, Papa, come here. The fisherman's coming.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Wow, the fisherman.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Yes, and the boy is with him.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
The loft is outside.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
You don't want to do it, do you?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
No, but I've got to do it.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Right.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Here you are.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
So, uh, what can we do for you?

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Oh!

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Happy birthday. Happy birthday to you.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Hmm?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Tough just told us it's your birthday today,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
so all the best wishes from us.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
My birthday? Is it really?

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Excuse me for asking, but how old are you?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I just don't remember.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
It doesn't matter. I'm sorry we don't have any presents.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
I haven't had coffee for many, many years.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Bring the barrel, Moomin, Mama.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Yes, dear.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Now, let me see, I found this sauerster.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
I wonder if it suits me. What do you think?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Oh.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
I suppose this must belong to the lighthouse keeper.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Why don't you try it on?

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
You look good in a sauerster. There it suits you.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
We'd love to know why you left the island

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
and why you didn't come back in

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
and also why you didn't like the land.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
We really would like to know if you feel you could tell us.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I was so lonely.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
For years and years.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Then I just went away.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
I'm afraid that's all.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
But you did come back. Surely that must mean something.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I knew I'd lived here for too long.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Much too long.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
You see, I didn't really fit in anywhere else.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
This is the lighthouse keeper's uniform, isn't it?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Why don't you put it on again?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
And look, it's nice here.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I'd like to stay with you, mind that.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I'll stay if you let me.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Ah, I'd love that.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
It'd be fun to see you looking like a lighthouse keeper.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Oh, hooray!

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Oh, hooray!

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Three days later, the movements left the island.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
They decided to leave at night

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
with the safe blow of the lighthouse beams guiding their path

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
out in the way to movement valley.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Movement papa had quite forgotten about his epic novel of the sea,

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
but couldn't wait to start again on his memoirs.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:12.000 --> 22:19.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
They're always happy and always at play.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
The movements.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
The movements.

22:34.000 --> 22:40.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:42.000 --> 22:49.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
They're always happy and always at play.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
The movements.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
The movements.

23:04.000 --> 23:10.000
The movements.

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
