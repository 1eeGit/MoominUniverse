Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come. Come on and sit down here with me.

It's your father's old girlfriend, of course never. Oh, I'm sure he had dozens and dozens

8
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,800
Moomin Papa was a very kind and handsome young man a voice from the past

9
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
Moomin Papa liquid. I've got for you

10
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,340
Oh, no, I was

11
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:25,620
Moomin Mama, I think you should go back to the kitchen. Whatever for a little

12
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,980
My because Moomin Papa's stormy youth is catching up with him. Please Papa tell us it's not that kind of letter

13
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,780
Whatever it was it was a long time ago long before I ever met you

14
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,180
No, it's not that kind of letter

15
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,540
What sort of letter is it then? Oh much worse. It's from Aunt Jane. Who's that?

16
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:58,820
Mine my dear is on my father's side. Oh, how boring. You look very pale suddenly dear

17
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:07,060
Yes, because she's coming for a visit tomorrow. Oh, don't worry. There's plenty of time for arranging a welcome party

18
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,460
But I don't like her and I don't want it to come for a visit

19
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,660
Moomin Papa, why not? Well, you'll soon see she's very rich very rich

20
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:25,220
Yes, and she bosses everyone and we won't have a moment of peace. Oh, maybe she's so rich. She'll give us all wonderful presents

21
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,420
Goodness, this is so unexpected. Why is she coming here all of a sudden? Oh

22
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,580
She says she wants to discuss money matter as good heavens with me. She says there's no one else

23
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,060
So you see I'm in a very difficult situation. Oh, why can't you tell if you're not an expert

24
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:48,100
You don't tell Aunt Jane things. She tells you when that's that is not explained when you meet her

25
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,180
You'll know exactly what I mean

26
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,380
What do I know about money matters nothing? Not surprising since we've never had any

27
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:02,580
How can she expect a poor creature like you to know anything about money? Also, she's very very suspicious

28
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,140
And she says money is a terrible burden

29
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,260
Oh, I wouldn't mind shouldering her burden

30
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,700
Maybe you'll inherit it, and then we could share the money and have a wonderful time together

31
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,340
Hey

32
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,460
This time I almost did it

33
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,580
So

34
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,220
Moving Papa has a rich and very interesting

35
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,900
Yes, she's got so much money. She doesn't know what to do with it all. Oh

36
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,180
So snorke, why don't you ask her to invest in your flying ship? You'll need money to rebuild won't you?

37
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,340
It would be a great investment for her. It certainly would be. I'm sure she jump at it. Hmm

38
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,060
There'd be no harm in asking, I guess

39
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,140
Oh

40
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,900
What's the matter, Mr. Hemiellen? You look so unhappy

41
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,340
I'm stuck that's my problem. How's that?

42
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,260
Stuck in my research this magnifying glass is very good, of course

43
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,380
But I just can't get any further with my botanical research with this old-fashioned equipment

44
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,780
What I really need is a microscope and a laboratory

45
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,060
And they're expensive, I guess. Yes, they are and I don't have any money

46
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,900
Well moment Papa's aunt is coming over tomorrow and I know she's got any amount of money

47
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,500
Any amount?

48
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:17,620
I'll get her to finance you, Hemiellen and we'll get a big greenhouse and you'll grow orchids and roses and other things

49
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,460
And then we'll sell them. Oh, I'll get rich. You too

50
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:51,460
Hey, you over there. Hmm. Are you talking to me? Of course I am. Who else?

51
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,780
I said you know the way to move in a house young man. Yes, she might say I do show me where it is then

52
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,060
Over there. It's tall and blue. Just follow that stream and you can't miss it

53
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,740
Good would you be kind enough to take my suitcase? I'm sorry. I can't. I'm too busy

54
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,500
I'll reward you handsomely for your efforts. Think again young man

55
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,980
But all I want to do is fish

56
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,220
What you don't want money

57
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,460
I heard you were coming to visit moment papa. You're in Jane, aren't you? Oh well

58
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,420
Please to meet you. I'm here to take you to moment house. Is this your suitcase?

59
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,700
Wow, this suitcase is very heavy. Should they? It's full of golden coins

60
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:06,260
I can't stay in this house. I don't think I can take Aunt Jane. I'm going to hide out in the cave until she's gone

61
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,140
Oh

62
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,020
Bye-bye, Lindaer

63
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,420
Careful now, Aunt Jane. The banks have been slippery here and there

64
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,100
Around house house stupid typical of my nephew

65
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,940
Welcome to moment house Aunt Jane

66
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,940
Welcome Aunt Jane

67
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,420
I'd like you to meet us on moment

68
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,460
Please to meet you

69
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:50,500
She's very small for a daughter. Oh little my isn't ours. She just lives here and I won't get any bigger either

70
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,860
She's like a member of the family and was my worthless nephew. Why isn't he here? Oh

71
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:05,620
Well, he's a not a is he not at home? Well, no when will he be back? I don't know

72
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:11,620
He's away looking for inspiration for his work. So he won't be back for a while since when has he worked?

73
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:18,340
I'm here to see him. Maybe you can see me instead. What a splendid idea. How clever of you, movement

74
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:24,820
Ridiculous. He knows nothing about money in that case. It is high time. He learned as for his father

75
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,060
I may still disinherit him

76
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:35,700
I'm a member of his family too. I could talk to you about money matters. Really? Oh sniff is a great friend of mine

77
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,260
Hmm

78
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,300
But hardly a member of the family

79
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:50,100
Hello moment and you must be on Jane. I brought my brother to snark with me. He wanted to meet you

80
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,420
This is Aunt Jane be nice to

81
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:02,100
Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane. This is my lovely sister snort maiden who is moving special friend

82
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,260
The snorts and the movements may one day be related so in a way we're all really family

83
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,820
You maybe but not to me

84
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:19,780
I'm an inventor and due to an accident. I'm looking around for a sponsor a golden opportunity for anyone with some loose capital

85
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,900
Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane

86
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:33,620
I'm him milling a botanist of note. I heard that you might be willing to fund my scientific research and chain a golden opportunity for anyone with some spare money

87
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,260
You'd like me to fund your research

88
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:42,980
It was my idea if we built a greenhouse and grow rare orchids and roses we can make a lot of money

89
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,460
And you'll make a lot of money young man. I have a lot of money already

90
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,140
Oh, hasn't sniffed discuss this with you ma'am. You sniffed

91
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,500
Well, I was just getting around to it, Hamilton. Confusing

92
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:00,100
When I am famous for my botanical research and Jane, I don't know that will ever happen

93
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,140
This is very confusing indeed for me now. You're snork maiden a friend of movement is that right?

94
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:12,660
Oh, no, I'm the snork snort maiden's brother. I'm a friend of Moomin at Jane. Did you really explain about my important research sniff?

95
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,460
Did you really explain that I'm a member of the family?

96
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:23,060
Hey, she got it. So, Jane would be great if you weren't a member to make your own coin coin everyone

97
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:43,380
Here's your room, Jane. I do hope you'll be comfortable here. Just call if you need anything

98
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,860
Oh

99
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,700
Come out

100
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,540
Here's your suitcase. It was very heavy. Thank you

101
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,980
And him

102
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:14,180
What is it you want a reward? No, no, Jane. I mean, yes, I do but

103
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,660
Uh

104
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:23,620
Which is it will you make up your mind young man? I know where Moomin Papa is right now. He's a whale on a trip

105
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:29,460
I know. No, no. He's somewhere quite near quite near here. Well, where is he?

106
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,140
Moomin Papa said not to tell you where he's hiding. It's a secret. A secret? Yes

107
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,060
I suppose I can tell you but he'll be very angry. Where is he? Tell me now. Oh, well

108
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,780
If I tell you I'm taking a big risk

109
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,980
Oh, very well. How much do you want? I'll leave that to you

110
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Oh

111
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,460
Thank you for the information now you shall have your reward held out your hand

112
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,980
Oh

113
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,300
Is that all until I've seen him for myself with my own eyes. Yes

114
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,940
Huh

115
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,660
Oh, there's nobody here. Where is my worthless nephew? This is very strange

116
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,740
You tricked me haven't you? Well, no, I swear I would never do that

117
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,420
You certainly deserve no reward

118
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:59,220
Uh, but no way if we just look around we'll find him. He's in here somewhere. I know it. Hey, Moomin Papa, I got rid of her

119
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,740
Moomin mom. Yes, Aunt Jane. What is it? Tell me where my nephew is hiding

120
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,580
Well as I said before I want to know the truth

121
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,020
There he he's now let me see

122
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,860
Come on hurry up

123
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:26,180
He's hiding in the cave down by the beach. I've just been there Moomin Mama and I can't find him

124
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,180
Then he really must have gone away on a trip and why should he want to hide from me anyway

125
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:38,340
I think he might be a little bit afraid of you afraid of me afraid of his own hand

126
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,580
But why mostly he's afraid of money matters

127
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,180
Incredible

128
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,340
Afraid of me because of money matters

129
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
He must be utterly mad

130
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,420
What a family

131
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,420
I don't understand

132
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,220
It seems that only Smith knows anything about money

133
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,740
I know where Moomin Papa is right now

134
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,540
So you want some of my gold who do you young lady?

135
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,820
I couldn't care less about your silly gold

136
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,980
My silly gold indeed

137
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,420
With silly gold, I assure you you can do just anything you want

138
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,460
Seems to me your silly gold doesn't even help you to find Moomin Papa

139
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,580
Hmm? I think you should forget about your money

140
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,740
Young lady, money isn't something you can just forget about

141
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,740
It needs constant looking after

142
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,460
That's why I must talk to Moomin Papa at once

143
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,860
Now take me to that rascal nephew of mine

144
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,020
If you really know where he is, do you hear me?

145
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,780
Do you hear me?

146
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,820
Oh yes, I do

147
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
Do you hear me?

148
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
Of course

149
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
Oh wow frivolous

150
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,620
Not really, if I could find a small enough boyfriend

151
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,020
I'd be frivolous just like them too

152
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,820
Oh well, Frederick and I were frivolous once

153
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,820
Really? If you say so

154
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,820
I suppose I have to believe you

155
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,420
Fuck

156
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,820
What? Little May and Anne Jane walking together

157
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
What are they doing?

158
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
Little May is plotting something

159
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,820
Really?

160
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,820
Moomin?

161
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
Sniff's all right really

162
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:36,820
But sometimes he just can't withstand the lure of gold

163
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
Check me

164
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
No, we can't be right

165
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
Let's go back then

166
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
Fine, just take your time

167
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
Hi guys

168
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
Little May, what's the matter?

169
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
We have a guest

170
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
A guest

171
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
Moomin Papa

172
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
What?

173
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
Moomin Papa

174
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:06,820
Oh, so this is where you've been hiding?

175
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
Oh, what else?

176
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
You just wait

177
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
Oh, you shoot

178
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,820
Oh, I have seen Moomin

179
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
Wait a minute

180
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
No, you wait first

181
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
Wait a minute

182
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
Wait please

183
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
Moomin Papa was sort of on his way back from a trip

184
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
and then stopped by to play chess with me

185
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
Yes, exactly

186
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,820
No, yes, Moomin Mama told her the truth

187
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,820
Oh, I sort of stopped by

188
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Why are you so afraid of me, young man?

189
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,820
Well, I'm not really

190
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
I mean, it's not you

191
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
It's your money, I'm afraid of it

192
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
Really scares me

193
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Scared of my money?

194
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
Well, I know

195
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
It's perfectly good money at all in gold coins

196
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,820
Listen, nephew, I'm depending on you as my only relative

197
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,820
Yes, yes, please depend

198
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,820
When I get too old to do it, you must look after my gold for me

199
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,820
I'm relying on you

200
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
No, that's not possible

201
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
I know, and Jane, we can give it all away

202
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Must be those who'd love to have it

203
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,820
Must be those who need it more than we do

204
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
Oh, and green

205
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
Oh

206
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
Ah

207
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,820
Ah

208
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
Ah

209
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
Ah

210
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Ah

211
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
She's crazy

212
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,820
Don't worry, we'll think of something

213
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Oh, you would throw my money away without a cut

214
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,820
Why didn't mean to hurt you, Jane?

215
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
I know, let's put it all in the bank

216
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,820
Money likes being in the bank

217
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:48,820
My money would hate being in a back of a terrible idea

218
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,820
Oh no, banks are so nice nowadays

219
00:18:52,820 --> 00:19:00,820
Of course, they have flowers and shiny piggy banks and pretty paintings on the wall

220
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,820
Is that really true?

221
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,820
Right, come on everybody

222
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,820
Let's hurry home and fix a welcoming party for Jane

223
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,820
Yes, any reason is good enough

224
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,820
This was Grandma's best cake recipe, welcome at Jane

225
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:34,820
Let's drink a toast to the only millionaire in our small circle

226
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:40,820
May she live a long and healthy life, cheers, cheers

227
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,820
Now, this is your welcoming party at Jane, what's the matter?

228
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,820
Never in my life of I and my money felt ourselves as welcome before

229
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,820
I'm so happy I could cry

230
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,820
And once you start crying, you just want to go on

231
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,820
Please don't be unhappy, Jane, don't cry

232
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,820
Oh, dear, mum and Papa

233
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,820
Mum and Papa

234
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,820
Yes, Jane, what is it?

235
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,820
I'll put some of my gold in a bank, but you must look after the rest when I'm too old

236
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,820
Oh, hmm

237
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,820
And why not?

238
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:28,820
All right, we'll keep it in the cellar and make a nice little niche for it with seashells and moss

239
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,820
Someone go down and look at it every week, don't you worry, Jane, your money will be in safe hands

240
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,820
Not quite, but I had in mind

241
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,820
I know

242
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,820
But I suppose it can't be helped

243
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,820
It sounds rather nice, a cozy little niche down in the cellar

244
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,820
And if you take a look every week, but oh dear, it will miss me

245
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,820
Oh, and Jane

246
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,820
Very well, I have made up my mind

247
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,820
Leaving this sickest with you now, so you and my gold can get certain used to each other

248
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,820
Do what you want with it, your friends seem to have ideas about how to spend it

249
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,820
Flying ships and botanical research sound rather splendid

250
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,820
Oh, oh, wonder

251
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,820
I'm so happy for you

252
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,820
Darn, I should have let us up better than flowers

253
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

254
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,820
So ended the visit of the dreaded Anne Jane

255
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:30,820
And I'm sure Sniff will be able to think of some other use for the gold

256
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:38,820
They love the laughter, and they love the living, the movements

257
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:46,820
We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

258
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,820
They're always happy and always at play

259
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:57,820
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements

260
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:07,820
The movements, the movements
