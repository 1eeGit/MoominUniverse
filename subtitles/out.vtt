Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They are the movements.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So what do you think?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.459
In winter deep white snow covers the whole valley, and everyone goes to sleep so that they

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:52.459
keep warm.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:02:07.000
Look, there's a woman house. There's Moomin, our hero.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Moomin Papa and Moomin Mama.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And this little bundle must be little my.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I think before our story starts, we better wake everyone up with some spring sunshine. I'm so shy. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, It's springtime!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Moving!

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Oh, little Maya, you're up! It's hard to stay asleep with you yelling!

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I can't help it if I'm happy!

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.280
So yeah, woke me.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.360
I was having a lovely dream about living in a watermelon.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.919
But it's beautiful outside.

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.719
Oh gee, isn't it?

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.120
Is it really moving?

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.439
Yes it's all fresh.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.479
The flowers are out and the sun is shining.

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.400
So, I like being asleep.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.400
But it's spring.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.120
You said you wanted me to wake you as soon as spring was here.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.120
Oh boy, did I?

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.879
Yes you did little mime.

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.319
You said you wanted to be a welcome as soon as spring was here.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.280
Really?

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.560
Yes you did.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.759
Hmm.

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:17.759
Did I say something like that?

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.680
You can go back to bed if you want to.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.759
Nobody's making you get up little mime.

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.959
No.

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:24.480
There's really no point movement.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.000
I'm not sleepy anymore.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Well, there you are then.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Mama!

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Good spring, movement.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Movement, mama.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I'm starving. Have you got any water, Mellon?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
No, but there's lots of other things.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000
We'll all have a nice big breakfast.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I can hear a snuff gun. Wouldn't it be quicker to use the stairs?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
More fun this way.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Are you going home now?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Yes. Thanks very much for letting me spend the winter here.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Don't think your sister will be back yet though.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:29.199
I'll go anyway.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.800
Snuffkin!

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:33.600
Oh, hello, Moomin.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.000
It's really good to see you, Snuffkin.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.199
And you too?

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.800
You're back, Arlie. Aren't you having a good time?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.399
Yes, I was.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.600
But I didn't want to miss springtime in Moomin Valley.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.040
What did you do?

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.160
I'll tell you later.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.319
Let's go wake up, Sniff, and think of something exciting to do.

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.759
I don't think I'll like it.

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:07.000
He's still snoring, Moomin. I'll do it again.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Well, that's done it.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Come on, Sniff, it's spring. Snuckins here.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Please go away, you two.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
We're going to do something really exciting.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.519
Like what, moment? I can think of more

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:32.879
exciting things to do than this. Well let's imagine that we're the first ever to climb this mountain.

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:38.240
It's such a clear day. We'll be able to see all the movement valley when we get to the top and the sea.

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:48.000
Good morning Mr. Emulets. Morning, moment. Are your father and mother up?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Yes. Mama was when I came out.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Good. I'll never understand how you can sleep for months on end.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
We like it.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Oh, yeah.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Oh.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Why do they always have to do something exciting? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Uh-huh.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Uh-huh.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Why can't I always have to do something exciting?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
What a gorgeous view!

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
It really is.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Hey, look, they're smoke coming from Moment House.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
We should have stayed at home.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
My bet Mom and Mama's cooking something good.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Look.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
What is it?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
We're not the first here after all.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Look over there.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
A top hat.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Hmm.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
A rather large one.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I wonder who's had it is.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.839
I don't know, but I wonder who's how it is.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.680
I don't know, but I know Poppa would like it.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.740
Hmm, it's much too big.

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:03.079
Look. Oh dear, what's it?

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:07.000
Oh, I can really get inside of it.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
You see, I cover for my old one.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Oh, I can't moment it.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Stop, moment.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
No, that's enough nonsense.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I think I'll take it off now.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Oh, damn.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
What's the matter?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I can't move it. It's stuck, movement.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I'll give you a hand.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Paul, it's harder.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Oh, my God.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.960
Oh, that's better. Thank you.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.559
What's all this noise?

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:53.039
Papa's head got stuck in the hat, Mama.

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:55.039
Oh, yes, and where did that come from?

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:59.840
Oh, a moment, Mama. The children found it when they were out and brought it back for me.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.840
It's very smart.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.039
What shall we do with it, Papa?

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:07.399
There is something strange about it.

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:09.000
Shall I throw it away then?

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:12.279
Oh no, it's too good for that.

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:14.480
Do we know anyone with a very big hand?

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.159
No, moving, Papa.

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:19.480
I know what we can do with it.

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:20.720
Ah!

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.159
It's a...

00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:25.399
A waste paper basket, Moommo-mo-mo-mo.

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:27.840
That's right, Will, done, Snuffkin.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.600
That was easy.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.080
Come on, Snuffkin.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:47.000
Come and have some breakfast with us. Beautiful.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Beautiful. Yes. Sorry to disturb you, but I'm going to see Momen.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Uh-huh.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Do you want to come with me, Snork?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Uh-huh.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Or would you rather stay here?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Uh-huh.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Well, are you coming or not?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Uh-huh.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Not coming, man?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Uh-huh.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Snork?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Well, you know my flying ship is almost finished.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.600
It'll be a little bit more than a year. Well, are you coming or not? Uh-huh. Not coming, man? Uh-huh. Snork!

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.600
Well, you know my flying ship is almost finished.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.000
It'll be ready this year.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
You'll see.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
This is in his starlet moment.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.600
Whoa!

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:41.200
Oh, dear.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:47.120
Perhaps it needs a little more work.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.159
I wonder if you really can make a flying ship. Don't be silly, of course you can't.

00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:55.440
A little my snorke's always dreamed about doing it.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.960
Dreams are alright.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.799
Yes, as long as they're not impossible.

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:02.399
I suppose so.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Mmmmm. I suppose so. Hmm. Sniff, you're not still feeding your face, are you? Do you ever dream, Sniff?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Only nightmares about having no food at all, little my.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Hmm, I wonder who dropped this.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Now where can I put who dropped this.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Now where can I put it?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Oh, there you are.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Just the thing. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Oh!

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Oh!

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Oh!

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Oh!

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Oh!

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Oh!

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Oh!

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Oh!

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Oh!

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Oh!

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Oh!

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Oh!

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Oh!

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Oh!

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Oh!

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Oh!

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Oh!

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Oh!

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Wow! Golly, what are they?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
They're clouds.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Be careful! Don't touch it! It might be poisonous!

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
It feels like cotton.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Well, Eee!

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
This is great! I'm floating!

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Wonderful!

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Oh!

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Can I try?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.440
Are you ready, Snork Maiden? Wonderful!

00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:28.559
Can I try? Are you ready, Snork Maiden?

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:29.559
Yeah.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.519
Here we go.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.919
What have you got to hide?

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:45.000
My power!

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Wait for me!

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Hey, wait for me!

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Whoa!

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Whoa!

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Hey, wait for me!

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Let me get on!

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Ow!

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Ow!

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:09.000
I'm falling!

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Mumen Papa is in his study trying to write his memoirs.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
A lot has happened to him over the years, an awful lot.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.440
And he's trying to remember it. Mm-hmm.

00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:29.799
What was that?

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.519
Moment.

00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:34.360
Hi, Papa.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.360
What are you doing out there?

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.600
We're flying.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.519
The clouds just came out of the house.

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:43.320
Now try and get nearest so I can reach you.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.320
Oh, in.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.000
No, I'm reach you. Oh!

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
No, I'm alright.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Why don't you come for a ride?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Stop! Wait a minute!

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
It's great! You feel like a bird!

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Moment!

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Oh!

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Come on, Papa! Jump or you'll fall!

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
I hate you!

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
It's alright!

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Oh!

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
What?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Moment! Mama, quickly!

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
What's the matter?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Have you seen what the children are doing?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Yes.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Look at them, they're flying about on clouds, it can't be safe.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Don't worry, Papa, it's all right.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I told them to be careful.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Mom, snap.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Dad! Come on, Snapping. Do you want to go out? I want to. I want to.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Whoa, hey, wait a little cloud.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Wait for me, I'm gonna take you with me.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Hey, come on, you just keep coming back here.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.600
And I'm gonna take, yeah, I got you now.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.639
You are gonna get away from me.

00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:55.519
Here I go, come on, all of that ledge, come on.

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:57.360
Stop, I want you all up, Brad.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.200
Oh!

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.019
Oh!

00:14:59.019 --> 00:14:59.860
Oh!

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.700
Oh!

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.539
Oh!

00:15:01.539 --> 00:15:02.539
Oh!

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Oh boy, what's happening? My cloud's starting to go. Oh, wow, that was fun.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Yeah, it was, but I wasn't ready to stop.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Look, there's movement in Snork Maiden.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Hey, Hildo!

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Why have they still got cloud snuffed in?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.799
There's a starting to go as well. I think they'd better get off.

00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:26.639
Hey!

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:40.399
Right, I'll start counting.

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:44.399
One, two, three.

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:45.000
Mm-hmm. Do you want something little mine? One, two, three.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Mm-hmm.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Do you want something little mine?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Yes, a place to hide.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Five, six, seven.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Boy, I don't think there's any place to hide in here, is there?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Nah!

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Oh, it's too dirty in there.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I'm gonna have... I know. I'll hide in the head!

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Move!

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
One, two, one, two, one.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Shee-hata!

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Yeah.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Huh?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Hmm. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I'm sorry.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
I'm sorry.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I'm sorry.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:20.000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Snork made.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Boo!

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Moomin must be around here somewhere. Well, last time I saw him, he was hiding in the fireplace.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Have you found him yet?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
No.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Have you looked in the cellar?

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Yes, I have.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Wait a minute.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Did you hear someone laughing?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Where'd it come from?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
G.I. better go home.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.039
Oh, is there anything wrong?

00:17:46.039 --> 00:17:48.900
Yes, I can't find moment anywhere.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.339
Well, he's too fat to be most places.

00:17:51.339 --> 00:17:52.339
Ha-ha-ha.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.480
He's coming from under the hat.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.980
Ha-ha-ha.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.480
Ha-ha-ha.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.279
Ha-ha-ha.

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:01.279
Oh.

00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:05.000
Well, here I am, Sniff. Oh, on earth are you.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
I won, Landida.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
You looked everywhere in the house, and you couldn't find me.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
So I won.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Who would want to find you anyway?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Well, you were trying hard enough, weren't you?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
What is this, a new game?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
My name's Snorkmaden.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
What's yours?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
I'm the king of Moonman Valley. My pretty little friend. Hard enough, weren't you? What is this, a new game? My name's Snork Maiden. What's yours?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I'm the King of Moomin Valley. My pretty one.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
You're too ugly to be the King of anything.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Well, now, that's not a very nice thing to say to your friend. Is it Papa?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Now you'd better tell me what you have done with Moomin.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
But I'm here.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.539
Where? Right here. Where?

00:18:45.539 --> 00:18:46.599
Right here.

00:18:46.599 --> 00:18:47.799
Who are you?

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:49.640
And where is Mumin?

00:18:54.039 --> 00:18:55.079
Papa.

00:18:55.079 --> 00:18:57.119
I'm certainly not your papa.

00:18:57.119 --> 00:18:58.039
Yes, you are.

00:18:58.039 --> 00:18:58.759
Come on.

00:18:58.759 --> 00:18:59.720
I'm Mumin.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.680
I don't know who you are.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.079
But you're not Mumin.

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:05.940
He's nice, and handsome handsome and nothing like you.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.259
Have you looked at yourself in a mirror?

00:19:09.259 --> 00:19:10.259
Ah!

00:19:10.259 --> 00:19:12.059
But where's my nose gone?

00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:14.140
I'll go something there anymore.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:14.980
Ah!

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:15.819
Ah!

00:19:15.819 --> 00:19:16.660
Oh no!

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.140
My tail's all pushing!

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:18.980
Ah!

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:19.819
Oh!

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.000
Ah! Ah! This is terrible! Oh! Oh!

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Who are you?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
What have you done with me?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
It must be a nightmare!

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
I want to come back!

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Go away, you're horrible!

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Dear me, what's all this noise?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
What's the noise?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Dear me, what's the noise?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Dear me, what's the noise? Dear me, what's the noise? Dear me, what's the noise? My bear! I want to go back! Go away your horrible bear!

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Dear me, what's all this noise?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
What's happened?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Mama! Mama! Mama!

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
What earth is this?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
He says he's moment, but just look at him.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
You don't look like high-moment.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
I am, I am. Please believe me, Mama. I am moving.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Well, I don't know. I'm sure.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Something's happened to me. Why do I look so different?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Now then calm down. This won't help at all.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:27.000
We don't need all this noise. If you really are moving, then everything will be alright. Just give me a minute or two and I'll know.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Mama, call me a moment, please.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I don't know what's happened, but I am me.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Honestly, I am.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Mama, please believe me.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
I am a moment.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Let me see.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Oh, Mama, you do know it's me.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
You must.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
You can forget your little moment.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.240
Please, Mama, please, Mama. Oh, please mama. Oh hush now hush now

00:20:57.599 --> 00:20:59.599
Mama

00:21:03.119 --> 00:21:07.000
Yes, you're my little woman, alright.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Oh, Mama!

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Oh!

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
A moment!

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Papa!

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
A moment, my boy!

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Where were you hiding?

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
In there!

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
In the hat?

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Let's hope it's the last we'll see of it. Mumenpappa decided that although it was a fine hat,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
it was too dangerous to keep.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
So Mumen threw it in the river and it floated away.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
He wasn't too sure about it though,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:25.000
because it was a rather special act. They're always happy and always at play.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
The movements.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
The movements.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
They love the laughter and they love the living.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:51.000
The movements, believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.500
They're always happy and go as it played.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:11.000
The movements, the moment, the moment.
