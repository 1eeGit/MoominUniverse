1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're here for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm going to say that I'm not going to say it. I'm going to say it. Here with me, here for you on your TV, they are the movements.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They are the movements.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So come with me, give me your hand.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll take you up to a moment land.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There were the movements.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:01:41,959
There were the movements. There was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la The seeds that movement and his friends had found in a box that had been cast up on the

15
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:46,000
beach had grown into a tropical forest.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It was beautiful, but also dangerous,

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
with man-eating plants kept a bay by snuffkin playing as harmonica.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But for how long?

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh dear. Oh!

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Snuffkin, don't stop playing your harmonica whatever you do, or they'll only get angry and attack us all over again.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If I don't stop soon, I might never want to play again.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, perhaps the music has made them more friendly.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Be careful, Mr. Hemmullen. Oh, don't worry.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Mr. Hemmullen and look out! What? Oh, oh, oh, oh!

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I want him.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't think the quickly stuck in play again! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:27,199
Ah! Papa, we must make sure the trap door won't open again. Ah, yes. What's this about a trap door?

29
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,199
In the kitchen. They almost got him before in the tag mama. We reached her just in time.

30
00:03:39,199 --> 00:04:06,000
Ah, there they are. I feel sorry for them. It can be helped, Snuffkin. If we let them out, we'll be...

31
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's no life.

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It makes me feel very uncomfortable...

33
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
having man-eating plants under the floor.

34
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, I see.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I feel sorry for them.

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It can be helped, Snuffkin.

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If we let them out, we'll be...

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
eating a life.

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,100
It makes me feel very uncomfortable... having man-eating plants under the floor. Now, we'll be... it in a life!

40
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,000
It makes me feel very uncomfortable having man-eating plants under the floor.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Always keep a kettle of boiling water

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and in case they break through.

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,500
The children are playing Tarzan.

44
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,500
They might as well, seeing as they've got a jungle to play in.

45
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,199
Still, planting those seeds might have been a terrible mistake.

46
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,399
Well, mama, I'm very glad that you did.

47
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,500
Just think what I would have missed.

48
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,839
And, moment, valley suddenly being full of tropical plants

49
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,920
is wonderful.

50
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,279
I'm not fond of traveling, as you know.

51
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,519
And you've brought the plants to me.

52
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,319
Well, the trees make it much cooler.

53
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,079
But those man eaters.

54
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,000
I could do without them.

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh!

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're just like Tarzan.

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Tarzan loves Jane.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, what bliss!

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I knew it!

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Stinky's over there.

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Stinky.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Tarzan, teach old Betty lesson.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yaaah!

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Ah!

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Ah!

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Ah!

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Ah!

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ah!

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Pretty stupid moment playing Tarzan without wild animals. Animals don't come from seeds. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Maybe it's chimpanzee. I know exactly what you need.

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Cheese.

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Bread.

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ah.

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What are you doing, Mama? Well, I don't like the thought of all those man-eaters still in the cellar.

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,199
So your father and I are going to sleep in the bathhouse.

76
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,399
We'll sleep outdoors too. We've just built ourselves a hut.

77
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,199
Snork maiden and little Mai too.

78
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,800
Yes, there's plenty of room.

79
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,800
All right, so that only leaves Mr. Himmelon sleeping in the house.

80
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,800
And he still busy checking all the different plans.

81
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,000
Mama, is everything ready?

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, yes, dear.

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh, aren't we ready?

84
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes, we are, Mr. Himmungen.

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
See you later.

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Stinky said he could get some wild animals, Papa.

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We're ever fro.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't know.

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I wouldn't trust him. He'll probably put a hedgehog in your sleeping bag.

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There it is. The hunt.

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:25,519
Oh, oh, that very well built. I'm not sure if I can get a chance to see the other other

92
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,519
other

93
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,519
other

94
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,519
other

95
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,519
other

96
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,519
other

97
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,519
other

98
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,519
other

99
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,519
other

100
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,519
other

101
00:07:43,519 --> 00:08:05,439
other other other I tell you, it's a wonderful place. You'll love it. A real tropical jungle. Are you sure it's quite nice here?

102
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,160
Well, of course, there you are.

103
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh. Oh, lovely it is to run free. Darling, let's be the first to get to Moomin Valley. Eh. Eh. Eh. Soon I'll have the largest collection in the botanic world,

104
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,200
and I will be famous, and people will come from all over.

105
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Now what have we here?

106
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,700
Go away, I'm not a zoologist.

107
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:17,299
Look, Moon. Those must be the monkey stinky promise to us.

108
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:21,500
Well, that's a surprise. Not like him at all. I just don't trust him.

109
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,440
What sweet things!

110
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Just like in Tarzan.

111
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,679
Huh?

112
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,200
What was that?

113
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
I don't know.

114
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Huh?

115
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,559
That sounds like some really wild animal, a lion or a tiger.

116
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,120
I'm frightened, movement.

117
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,220
Huh?

118
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,039
Very odd, just like home, isn't it?

119
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,120
Even if it isn't very big.

120
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,840
Perhaps we could live here.

121
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,799
Let's go hunting first, ice mill, humans.

122
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,200
Or be careful, darling. You're very out of practice.

123
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,000
I must warn them.

124
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
See anything?

125
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,000
No other thing. It must have been imagination.

126
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Run man!

127
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Keep quiet!

128
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Little Maw!

129
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I've just seen some tigers.

130
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
They're coming to get you!

131
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Tigers!

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Let's get back to the house quick!

133
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There's no time!

134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
They're nearly here!

135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We'll go to the bathhouse!

136
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Shall we eat him up? You know that Hamilins upset your tummy, dear, Est?

137
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I wonder where the movements are.

138
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Huh?

139
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Ah, just more animals that's all.

140
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Papa! Papa, help!

141
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What's the matter, Mumin?

142
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Little Maya's seen two tigers and they're looking for us.

143
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Tigers after us.

144
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,500
That rotten stinky probably told them we're good to eat or something.

145
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,919
Maybe we are.

146
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,879
They'll be here in a minute.

147
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:50,679
Right, moment.

148
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:53,000
You go and find the biggest stone you can

149
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,759
and bring it back with you.

150
00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:20,000
OK. This way.

151
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Papa will this one do? Yes, that's perfect. Right, get into the bathhouse and it's wiggly now. Here they come.

152
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Are you really going to eat them, Dearest?

153
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,299
Of course, my love. You see, I think they're hiding in that little house up there.

154
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:10,299
They've been very quiet if they are.

155
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,100
Huh, they're just too scared to move.

156
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,200
That's all.

157
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Why's that stone there?

158
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Whoa!

159
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
Whoa!

160
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Whoa!

161
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
My darling! Hey, it worked Papa! Well of course, Mumann.

162
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
My husband is drowning.

163
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, I'm so sorry Papa we must help.

164
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
He was just about to try and eat us Mama.

165
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,200
I'm sure he won't do it again.

166
00:13:49,440 --> 00:14:07,000
I suppose so, Mummyn. Hmm. I never thought I'd see the day. Moments rescuing a tiger.

167
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Here you are, dear.

168
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Tithe is tightly around him and we'll lift him out.

169
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:44,320
Thank you, mother. Oh, darling.

170
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Why, you are right, my love.? What happened did we eat them?

171
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
No you were drowning and they rescued you!

172
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh?

173
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Now embarrassing!

174
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Well they're in that cabin behind you if you still feel hungry but it was rather good of them to save you.

175
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No my appetite's completely gone.

176
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
We'll come back here then and we'll go.

177
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,299
I'll just jump over.

178
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,500
What?

179
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
What?

180
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,299
Oh.

181
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:15,100
What's the matter?

182
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,600
I can't remember how to jump.

183
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,299
We've been stuck in that zoo for too long.

184
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:23,799
Well, try and swim across, dear, East.

185
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,000
OK. the class dearest. Okay. Hmm?

186
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We copped everyone.

187
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The tigers are leaving.

188
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm glad he didn't grow.

189
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
I knew they wouldn't be mean enough to eat us after saving him. Let's throw.

190
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I knew they wouldn't be mean enough to eat us after saving him. Shall we jump in and swim back as well? It's not far.

191
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes. I'll go first.

192
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I want to go first.

193
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Don't, little mind. Be careful, movement. Look over there.

194
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Crocodiles!

195
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,500
Oh hurry up, moments!

196
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,000
Swim around the back and come up the ladder!

197
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
How can there be crocodiles in the sea? I thought they only lived in fresh water.

198
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
How are we going to get back to the shore now?

199
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We'll have to wait for a boat to come past.

200
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No, I'm afraid we'll have to think of something else, Mama.

201
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
We could be waiting for a wink or something for that to happen.

202
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
A whole week!

203
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But we'll starve, all they'll find is our bones bleached, waiting the sun.

204
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Don't worry, little my. Papa will think of something you'll see. I'll be back! I'll be back! I'll be back! I'll be back! I'll be back!

205
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'll be back!

206
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'll be back!

207
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'll be back!

208
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll be back!

209
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll be back!

210
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll be back!

211
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'll be back!

212
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll be back!

213
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll be back!

214
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'll be back!

215
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'll be back!

216
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll be back!

217
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'll be back!

218
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll be back!

219
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll be back!

220
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll be back!

221
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll be back!

222
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll be back!

223
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'll be back!

224
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,799
I'll be back! I'll be back! I'll be back! I'll be back! I'll be back! I didn't fancy landing a sea monster.

225
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,599
Help! Someone help! Help anybody!

226
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's Mr. Hemmulin. Oh, the Tigers must be after him quickly! I never made you so cross. I just told you not to eat my plants. Let me in! Oh!

227
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That fella's always been clumsy. We can't really help him.

228
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
No.

229
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh.

230
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh.

231
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh.

232
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh.

233
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Are you all right, Himmulan?

234
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh, dear, I think so. What about you? Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh, you're right, Himmungen. Oh, dear, I think so.

235
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,319
What about him?

236
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,319
Oh, dear.

237
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,579
What are you doing, Irino?

238
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:11,039
Get stuck in your brando.

239
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,680
Oh, this is anew, and on me.

240
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,440
So I'm loose.

241
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,880
I can't think of any other way.

242
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,680
You have to be very careful, though.

243
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:26,000
I think you're tasting? Yeah, I think you're tasting. Yeah, I mean, you think you're tasting.

244
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Ah, look where you're going.

245
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It was you who brought all the animals in, wasn't it?

246
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yes, you're right.

247
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's what you wanted.

248
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's a jungle now.

249
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I did a good job.

250
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh, really?

251
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Well, they're not wild animals at all.

252
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
They're quite friendly.

253
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Friendly?

254
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Ugh. They're quite friendly. Friendly! Uh... See what I mean? They make very good pets. Cute, aren't they? Ugh. Snake!

255
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll stick where are you!

256
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Why do you want?

257
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The rhino and the tigers have become pets of the movement family.

258
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You're not going to let that happen to you.

259
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Well, are you?

260
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm not.

261
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Snake!

262
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Snake, where are you?

263
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Why do you want?

264
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The rhino and the tigers have become pets of the movement family.

265
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You're not going to let that happen to you.

266
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Well, are you?

267
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Snake!

268
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Snake! Snake! Snake, where are you? Why do you want? The rhino and the tigers have become pets of the movement family.

269
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You're not gonna let that happen to you.

270
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, are you?

271
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's not.

272
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'll bring snorked maiden and movement here tonight.

273
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
There's no need to eat all of them just bite off their tails, alright?

274
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Okay.

275
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You'll be really amazed like I was.

276
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's big enough for both of you to sit on.

277
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
How lovely, a giant water lily.

278
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I wonder if the seeds came from that box you all found.

279
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh, I can't wait to see it.

280
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Looking at the size of the jungle, there must have been an awful lot of seeds in that box.

281
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I suppose the wind could have blown them anywhere.

282
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Where's the giant water, Lily? Let's see now.

283
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Uh, over there.

284
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh!

285
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
How wonderful!

286
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You see, I wish you'd learn to trust me.

287
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm a very honest guy.

288
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,920
It's so soft and pink and beautiful.

289
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,619
How romantic to be on a boat made from a flower.

290
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:43,279
This is unbelievable. Our old box seems to have grown into a tropical swamp.

291
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,779
It's a lot nicer. Hey, stinky.

292
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,079
Stinky?

293
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,180
Oh.

294
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,680
I can't see him anywhere.

295
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:57,019
I wonder how far we'll float.

296
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:59,019
It's getting dark, moman.

297
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:01,019
Whoa!

298
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,019
Whoa!

299
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:05,519
Whoa! Whoa!

300
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Gotcha!

301
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,559
We must get away!

302
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,759
We're!

303
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,839
I don't know!

304
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,599
Yet?

305
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,119
Locke, there's the sea!

306
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,640
Put the crooked aisles!

307
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,680
Over there, Stark made them!

308
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,640
A boat!

309
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Well, it's the only way we'll get away from this monster!

310
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
AHHHH!

311
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
UGH!

312
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
AHHHH!

313
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
UGH!

314
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Keep going, Snork Maid. We're almost there.

315
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Wait!

316
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Mumin and Snorkmaid kept swimming as fast as they could.

317
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
They had a head start on the snake, but now he was catching up.

318
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,839
Even though movements are very good swimmers, unfortunately for them, so are snakes.

319
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,640
They love the laughter,

320
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,440
and they love the living, the movements.

321
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,720
Believe it is sharing and caring,

322
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,720
and giving the movements.

323
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,000
They're always happy, and always at play.

324
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

325
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The movements, the movements, they love the laughter

326
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
and they love the living, the movements

327
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

328
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
They're always happy and goes at play

329
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:13,519
The Moons are having fun day after day, the Moves, the Moves
