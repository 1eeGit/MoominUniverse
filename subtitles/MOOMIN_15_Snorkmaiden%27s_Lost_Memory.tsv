0	21000	Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come. Come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here for you are your TV. They are the movements. They are the movements.
29000	35000	So come with me. Give me your hand. I'll take you up to a movement land.
35000	43000	You can fly just like a bird. Sing that song ever. There were the movements.
43000	58000	There were the movements. There were the movements. There were the movements.
73000	93000	There were the movements. There were the movements.
93000	108000	For a whole week, snorkemaiden had been curled up on the sofa, reading fairy tales.
108000	119000	It's a lovely day and at last, movement is persuaded to come out for a walk in the lonely mountains.
119000	130000	Oh, it's beautiful up here. Aren't you glad you came now? This is much better than fairy tales, isn't it snorkemaiden?
130000	141000	Oh, look, movement. It's Adelvice. No, it isn't. That doesn't grow here at all.
141000	147000	I'm sure it is. I know what it looks like. I'm sorry, but it's not.
147000	155000	Oh, it's just like in Heidi. No, it's not. It's just a daisy. Oh, come on. I want to pick it.
155000	162000	Oh, no, it's too dangerous. I know then. You can do it. You're my boyfriend, aren't you, movement?
163000	171000	Well, I suppose we could climb down there, but I promise you it's not Adelvice. That only grows in the Alps and there are hundreds of miles away.
171000	189000	I know it's Adelvice. Be careful. They don't care about danger in fairy tales. That's why they call them fairy tales, silly.
189000	193000	Fairy Princess, please accept this, my humble offering.
193000	199000	Thank you, Brave Knight. You are right, movement. This isn't Adelvice. See, I told you...
199000	205000	It's gonna be hard to get down from here, you know? Can't we go back the way we came?
205000	213000	Well, I think it'll be easier to try to get to that path. If you say so...
214000	222000	It's nearer anyway, and better than going up. I'm surprised you're such a good climber.
222000	225000	Oh, Royalty is good at practically everything.
225000	240000	It's not made of. It's not made of.
240000	249000	It's not made of.
249000	264000	Let me see six petals. What was that, a giant snowball? It can't be, it isn't winter.
264000	270000	Well, nothing of interest to me. Now, where was I?
270000	274000	We start hemulating. Has Snorkmaiden just gone past you?
274000	278000	Snorkmaiden, no, I've seen going past. It's a very large snowball.
278000	280000	That was Snorkmaiden.
280000	284000	But she's not made of snow?
284000	288000	Stop! Snorkmaiden, stop!
295000	305000	Snorkmaiden, snorkmaiden!
305000	312000	Oh, I'll praise the boobah. She's still breathing. She's just knocked herself out.
318000	320000	Oh, Mum and what's happened to her?
320000	322000	She's unconscious.
322000	324000	What are you trying to do?
324000	327000	I want to get her home to Mama.
327000	330000	Oh, difficult. She should lose a bit of weight.
330000	335000	Perhaps she'd come around if we splashed cold water on her face.
335000	338000	Oh, there's nothing to fetch it in.
338000	344000	Ah, if you cut some bark off a tree trunk, you could make a small container.
344000	348000	What a good idea. If you stay here, I'll go and do that.
351000	353000	Wake up, Snorkmaiden.
366000	368000	Oh, that's cold.
374000	376000	Has she come around yet, Mr. Hemulet?
376000	377000	No.
378000	379000	Okay.
383000	385000	Oh, good. It's working.
385000	387000	How are you feeling, Snorkmaiden?
387000	389000	Are you all right, Snorkmaiden?
389000	392000	Oh, where am I?
392000	395000	We're still up in Lonely Mountains.
395000	397000	Who am I?
397000	402000	Why Royal Highness the Princess of Lonely Mountains?
402000	404000	What? A Princess?
405000	407000	Oh, yes, of course.
409000	410000	And who are you?
410000	413000	I am the Prince of Lonely Mountains.
413000	414000	Oh, yeah.
414000	415000	Oh, yeah.
415000	417000	With that ridiculous shape?
417000	419000	No, a gesture, perhaps.
419000	421000	You want?
422000	425000	You there. Do not laugh.
434000	437000	I think the poor girl must have lost her memory.
437000	440000	Of course not. She's just pretending.
441000	445000	When does not whisper with royalty present, do you hear?
445000	447000	So sorry, Royal Highness.
450000	453000	A poor crafters cabin.
453000	455000	This is your castle, ma'am.
455000	457000	Royalty doesn't live in shacks.
457000	461000	Snorkmaiden, stop calling us that.
461000	463000	It's very rude.
463000	465000	Oh, forgive me.
465000	467000	A royal castle is elsewhere.
467000	468000	Is it not?
468000	469000	What?
469000	471000	That must be hunting lodge.
471000	474000	No, of course, that's what it is.
474000	476000	Good, we accept that.
484000	488000	Are you two going to tell me what you're so busy looking at?
494000	497000	Send a maid to my room, my good man.
498000	500000	A maid?
502000	504000	My good man.
509000	512000	Papa, have you seen Snorkmaiden?
512000	514000	Yes, up there.
518000	522000	Mama, please would you go on have a word with Snorkmaiden?
522000	524000	Have you been quarreling?
524000	525000	Oh, no.
525000	527000	It's just that she fell and banged her head.
527000	529000	And now she thinks she's a royal princess.
529000	530000	What?
538000	541000	Ah, Nanette, come here, please.
541000	542000	Nanette?
542000	544000	I'm Boomin, Mama.
544000	548000	Oh, we're too weary for your foolish jokes, girl.
548000	551000	Oh, we are very tired indeed, Nanette.
551000	555000	Please bring our silk nighty with the hand embroidered swans and clowns.
555000	557000	Then you may go.
562000	563000	I wish you, Mama.
563000	565000	All right, I'm sure.
565000	567000	But she seems convinced she's a princess.
567000	569000	Sounds as if it's dangerous, doesn't it, Mama?
569000	571000	Oh, I don't think so.
571000	574000	I was only joking when I called her a princess.
574000	576000	I'm very glad you didn't call her an opera singer.
576000	578000	Is Snorkmaiden asleep now?
579000	583000	Oh, yes, in a night gown with crowns and swans embroidered on it.
583000	586000	And another thing, Boomin, she wants a canopy put up immediately.
586000	587000	What's that?
587000	593000	Oh, a fancy cover over the bed that's draped in silks, envelopes, and tassels.
593000	597000	Oh, she was very upset because there wasn't one there already.
597000	599000	It might be necessary.
599000	601000	Her memory could have come back by the time she wakes up.
601000	603000	Why don't we wait and see?
603000	605000	She might be fine after a rest.
605000	607000	I sure hope so.
607000	610000	But what do we do if it hasn't come back?
610000	612000	Let's think about that if it happens.
612000	614000	We might not have to build that canopy.
614000	616000	Let me try it.
616000	617000	Try what?
617000	619000	To get Snorkmaiden's memory back, what else?
619000	620000	Oh, how?
620000	623000	Well, I think that if she sees me, she'll remember me
623000	625000	and then she'll remember everything else too.
625000	627000	Don't be silly little Mai.
627000	630000	If she doesn't remember me, why should you remember you, eh?
630000	633000	Simple, because I'm unforgettable.
633000	635000	There is that, I suppose.
637000	642000	She's still fast asleep.
642000	645000	Well, I'm glad we made the canopy anyway.
645000	648000	It looks really great, doesn't it?
648000	650000	Oh, oh, look.
650000	654000	She's opening her eyes.
654000	656000	Are you awake?
656000	657000	Get up, Snorkmaiden.
657000	658000	Come on.
658000	660000	Let's go down to the beach.
660000	662000	And who is that person?
662000	663000	Come on.
663000	664000	You remember me.
664000	666000	I warn you if you know you'll be sorry.
667000	669000	Oh, quite amusing.
669000	671000	Ah, so you remember me now.
671000	672000	Of course we do.
672000	674000	There you are, I told you.
674000	675000	Who am I then?
675000	678000	Well, you're another court jester.
678000	679000	Of course.
679000	684000	Ah, don't be little Mai.
684000	687000	A court jester.
687000	689000	Oh, very funny.
689000	691000	She's a better clown than the other one.
692000	694000	You can perform it our wedding.
694000	697000	You are a wedding.
701000	703000	I'm stinky.
703000	705000	What are you doing here?
705000	708500	I'm stinky.
708500	712000	What are you doing here?
712000	725000	Moment asked me to come over to Moment House and propose to some princess.
725000	727000	Moments lost his marbles as well then.
727000	729000	I think he wanted stinky as a contrast.
729000	730000	You what?
730000	734000	You mean to tell me you're both my rivals for the hands of the royal princess?
735000	737000	Well, it's not very original.
737000	742000	But in order to win the princess and have her kingdom stinky, you'll need to saw three riddles.
742000	746000	Hey, that's great! What's this kingdom like?
746000	750000	All right, sooner number one, you may now enter.
750000	752000	Oh, that's me.
753000	759000	Oh, hi, princess. How are you doing?
759000	762000	Jester, is this man a suitor?
762000	763000	He is.
763000	766000	I fear he does not treat us with respect.
766000	768000	Forgive him, your highness.
768000	773000	He is from a foreign land and does not know the ways of your kingdom.
773000	776000	Well, all right, very well.
776000	779000	Here is the first riddle. Are you ready?
779000	780000	Fire away!
780000	784000	Now then, listen, what is it that is yellow, has four legs and sings?
784000	787000	Oh, dear. And unusual, canary?
787000	789000	With four legs, you nincomboop.
789000	792000	I don't know any birds with four legs, but I do.
792000	793000	I don't know.
793000	794000	I don't know.
794000	795000	I don't know.
795000	796000	I don't know.
796000	797000	I don't know.
797000	798000	I don't know.
798000	799000	I don't know.
799000	801000	With four legs, you nincomboop.
801000	803000	I don't know any birds with four legs.
803000	806000	Who said it was a bird?
806000	809000	All right, then, what's the answer, snark baby?
809000	811000	He shows no respect.
811000	813000	Throw him into a dungeon and give him no food.
813000	817000	Your highness, he is temporarily out of his mind after the long journey here.
817000	820000	Hang on, I'm not out of my mind.
820000	821000	How do I pee?
821000	824000	How for what's the answer? That's what I want to know.
824000	827000	Silence, it does not concern you.
827000	829000	We believe you to be of lowly birth.
835000	837000	Sorry about this, napkin.
837000	838000	Don't worry.
841000	844000	Hmm, no, sir Gellad, but not bad.
844000	847000	I am honored to be here, your royal highness.
847000	848000	He'll do.
848000	850000	An easy riddle to start.
850000	851000	Here it is.
851000	855000	First, what is the number of which we think?
855000	856000	Take your time.
856000	857000	Two.
857000	860000	For a faux-gallant night, that is correct.
860000	863000	Now listen, what is the word upon our mind?
863000	864000	Love.
864000	865000	That's amazing.
865000	868000	Truly, the suitor has brains as well as looks.
868000	869000	Question three.
869000	871000	There are two numbers on our mind.
871000	872000	What do they add up to?
872000	873000	Answer carefully for it.
873000	876000	Could unlock your princess's heart.
876000	877000	21.
877000	881000	Oh, was that right, too?
881000	883000	Oh no, it was 22.
887000	890000	My heart is heavy.
890000	893000	For chance we should have said it was correct.
893000	895000	He was rather cute.
895000	897000	Was he not just her?
897000	899000	It's your turn now, stinky.
899000	904000	Well, I suppose that even half of Snortiles would be something.
904000	907000	Think she'll ever get her memory back?
907000	909000	Of course she will.
909000	911000	This is not our idea of a suitor.
911000	914000	His heart is aching for you, your royal highness.
915000	917000	Ah, let it ache.
917000	918000	Oh, all right.
918000	919000	I'll give him a chance.
919000	921000	Here is a question number one.
921000	923000	What is the number we are thinking of?
923000	926000	Well of all our stupid questions.
926000	928000	We haven't all day.
928000	931000	Oh, well of...
931000	932000	Four.
932000	933000	Indeed not.
933000	937000	It is 3,598,765.
937000	939000	Begone out.
939000	942000	Hey, Snortiles, that's up there.
943000	945000	It's not fair right there, ma'am.
945000	947000	Go home.
947000	949000	Give me another one I want after.
949000	951000	Oh, what a rude suitor.
951000	954000	We are no longer in the mood for royal marriage, Jester.
954000	956000	At least not today.
956000	958000	A wise decision.
958000	960000	A princess of the lonely mountains.
960000	962000	They will be prostrate with grief,
962000	964000	but bid the other suitors to go home.
964000	966000	Do not let them beg.
966000	967000	We would not like that.
967000	969000	Very well, your royal highness.
969000	970000	Do it kindly.
970000	971000	We wish them no pain at all.
971000	974000	From this day on, we shall devote ourselves to good works
974000	976000	and to the well-being of our people.
976000	978000	Oh.
978000	981000	You, I didn't want to marry you anyway.
981000	983000	Wonder what Snort maintenance up to now?
983000	985000	Upstairs thinking.
985000	988000	She says she'll devote her life to good works.
988000	990000	Works, what works?
990000	993000	I don't know, but she probably wants to be remembered
993000	994000	in the history books.
994000	998000	The princess who was adored by her subjects.
999000	1002000	Oh, she's coming down.
1005000	1008000	Your royal highness, may I assist you?
1008000	1010000	Send the net to us.
1010000	1012000	She is on an errand, your highness.
1012000	1014000	Then have someone else make soup,
1014000	1016000	nourishing but not too rich.
1016000	1018000	Soup, highness?
1018000	1019000	Yes indeed.
1019000	1023000	And then we shall take it to our poor subjects ourselves.
1023000	1024000	What kind of soup?
1024000	1026000	We don't know.
1026000	1027000	We eat. We don't cook.
1027000	1029000	The poor will be happy with anything
1029000	1031000	brought by the princess herself.
1031000	1034000	Now hurry man, be quick about it.
1037000	1039000	Now she wants some soup.
1044000	1045000	This will be ample.
1045000	1046000	The poor do not eat much.
1046000	1048000	It would only make the meal.
1048000	1051000	I don't know anyone poor around here, your majesty.
1051000	1053000	Nonsense.
1057000	1059000	Do what, do what.
1068000	1070000	Greetings jester.
1070000	1071000	What now?
1071000	1073000	We're taking soup to the poor.
1073000	1075000	Made with our own regal fingers.
1075000	1077000	Do you know where they are jester?
1077000	1078000	Your fingers?
1078000	1079000	Oh, I know.
1079000	1080000	Good, wonderful.
1080000	1082000	Take us to them now.
1082000	1084000	They will be so grateful.
1084000	1086000	You back princess.

1310000	1314000	And so Snork maiden's brief spell as a royal princess came to an end.
1314000	1317000	Except that she was the only one who didn't remember it.
