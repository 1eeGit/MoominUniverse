654040,656040,"Oh, thank you, Papa.",649200,654400,"SPEAKER_02"
656040,658040,"Mama, thank you, Mama.",654700,654700,"SPEAKER_06"
656040,658040,"Mama, thank you, Mama.",654700,658800,"SPEAKER_05"
659040,662040,"That's great, but what will Snuffkin say?",654700,654700,"SPEAKER_06"
659040,662040,"That's great, but what will Snuffkin say?",654700,658800,"SPEAKER_05"

682040,684040,"Don't be disappointed, Moomin.",679500,681400,"SPEAKER_08"
684040,686040,"I told you I travel alone.",682700,696400,"SPEAKER_08"
686040,687040,"I need to.",682700,696400,"SPEAKER_08"
687040,690040,"After spending the rest of the year here, just as I need to be here,",682700,696400,"SPEAKER_08"
690040,692040,"after spending the winter alone.",682700,696400,"SPEAKER_08"
692040,695040,"And the joy of returning to Moomin Valley is something I wouldn't miss.",682700,696400,"SPEAKER_08"
695040,697040,"Which Snuffkin, I thought.",682700,696400,"SPEAKER_08"

852040,854040,"Has he really finished it then?",848000,853900,"SPEAKER_06"
855040,856040,"No, not yet.",854700,866000,"SPEAKER_06"
856040,858040,"There's still a lot of work to do on him.",854700,866000,"SPEAKER_06"
858040,860040,"Then I wonder why he's letting us see it.",854700,866000,"SPEAKER_06"
860040,862040,"He's always refused before.",854700,866000,"SPEAKER_06"
862040,864040,"What's made him change his mind?",854700,866000,"SPEAKER_06"
864040,866040,"But I asked him this time.",854700,866000,"SPEAKER_06"
866040,868040,"I said I wanted to show it to you.",866000,870500,"SPEAKER_04"
868040,869040,"It just needed a woman's touch.",866000,870500,"SPEAKER_04"
869040,871040,"What did you say to him?",866000,870500,"SPEAKER_04"
871040,873040,"First, he said absolutely not.",866000,870500,"SPEAKER_04"
873040,875040,"But when I told him how ill you were in that,",871100,885000,"SPEAKER_04"
875040,877040,"you probably wouldn't be with us much longer.",871100,885000,"SPEAKER_04"
877040,879040,"He gave in and said we could see it.",871100,885000,"SPEAKER_04"
879040,882040,"Just you and me have claimed not that it'll snorke maiden.",871100,885000,"SPEAKER_04"
882040,883040,"Oh, good.",871100,885000,"SPEAKER_04"
883040,885040,"Because sometimes some people are very depressed",871100,885000,"SPEAKER_04"
885040,886040,"and just lying bad.",885000,891000,"SPEAKER_06"
886040,888040,"They've done something bad.",885000,891000,"SPEAKER_06"

937040,938040,"Quick, Moomin.",936600,940700,"SPEAKER_06"
938040,940040,"You just agree with everything I say snorke maiden.",936600,940700,"SPEAKER_06"
940040,941040,"Oh.",936600,940700,"SPEAKER_06"
942040,944040,"I thought you were in bad Moomin.",940700,941000,"SPEAKER_05"
944040,946040,"No, we're going to see snorke.",942700,944400,"SPEAKER_05"

947040,948040,"Really?",946400,947400,"SPEAKER_05"
948040,949040,"Yes, he needs to clear a runway",947700,952800,"SPEAKER_06"
949040,951040,"for when the flying ship is finished.",947700,952800,"SPEAKER_06"
951040,952040,"We're going to help him do it.",947700,952800,"SPEAKER_06"

953040,954040,"Yes.",952800,966300,"SPEAKER_05"
954040,955040,"Are you really, Moomin?",952800,966300,"SPEAKER_05"
955040,956040,"You got out of bad to do that.",952800,966300,"SPEAKER_05"
956040,960040,"I'm afraid I find it very strange that snorke is asked to go along",952800,966300,"SPEAKER_05"
960040,963040,"and help him cut down bushes and dig up roots and things.",952800,966300,"SPEAKER_05"
963040,966040,"You might have noticed I'm not a complete fool.",952800,966300,"SPEAKER_05"
966040,967040,"But it's true, little Mai.",965800,967100,"SPEAKER_06"
967040,968040,"Oh, yes.",965800,967100,"SPEAKER_06"
968040,970040,"Well, at least you could have invented a better lie.",967200,967200,"SPEAKER_05"
968040,970040,"Well, at least you could have invented a better lie.",967200,974800,"SPEAKER_05"
970040,974040,"You must think I'm pretty stupid to believe a pathetic story like that.",967200,967200,"SPEAKER_05"
970040,974040,"You must think I'm pretty stupid to believe a pathetic story like that.",967200,974800,"SPEAKER_05"
974040,976040,"But it's the truth.",967200,967200,"SPEAKER_05"
974040,976040,"But it's the truth.",967200,974800,"SPEAKER_05"
976040,978040,"And we need your help.",975000,976200,"SPEAKER_06"

980040,981040,"I don't want to hear anymore.",978000,995600,"SPEAKER_05"
981040,983040,"I think it's very sad that you have to pretend.",978000,995600,"SPEAKER_05"
983040,985040,"You're trying to hide something from me",978000,995600,"SPEAKER_05"
985040,988040,"and I'm not interested in what sort of sneaky underhanded thing it is.",978000,995600,"SPEAKER_05"
988040,989040,"But little Mai.",978000,995600,"SPEAKER_05"
989040,992040,"No, but, and anyway, I'm a little too busy at the moment",978000,995600,"SPEAKER_05"
992040,994040,"to take any notice of what's going on.",978000,995600,"SPEAKER_05"

1036040,1038040,"Wow.",1027900,1028800,"SPEAKER_07"
1045040,1047040,"It's nearly ready, isn't it?",1036600,1037300,"SPEAKER_06"
1047040,1049040,"Oh, no, there's a lot more to do.",1047000,1056000,"SPEAKER_07"
1049040,1051040,"The machine isn't half finished yet.",1047000,1056000,"SPEAKER_07"
1051040,1054040,"And as you can see, there's a lot to do on the ship itself",1047000,1056000,"SPEAKER_07"
1054040,1057040,"but I'm getting there slowly.",1047000,1056000,"SPEAKER_07"
1057040,1061040,"I never thought it would be so fantastic, smork.",1047000,1056000,"SPEAKER_07"
1061040,1066040,"Well, I suppose you could say the design wasn't a complete failure.",1058100,1060500,"SPEAKER_06"
1066040,1069040,"I'm quite sure it'll fly beautifully.",1061900,1065400,"SPEAKER_07"
1069040,1071040,"Oh, thank you.",1067100,1069300,"SPEAKER_06"
1071040,1073040,"Do you really think it will, woman?",1069800,1073100,"SPEAKER_07"
1073040,1075040,"I can see it now.",1069800,1073100,"SPEAKER_07"
1075040,1078040,"High up in the air, dodging in and out of the clouds,",1073800,1079100,"SPEAKER_06"
1078040,1080040,"way up above the world.",1073800,1079100,"SPEAKER_06"

1085040,1087040,"Shouldn't you sit down and rest?",1080700,1091200,"SPEAKER_07"
1087040,1089040,"Do you know your illness?",1080700,1091200,"SPEAKER_07"
1089040,1091040,"It doesn't help to get too excited.",1080700,1091200,"SPEAKER_07"
1091040,1093040,"Ha, I shouldn't worry, smork.",1080700,1091200,"SPEAKER_07"

1099040,1101040,"Throw that door.",1096800,1099200,"SPEAKER_07"
1101040,1102040,"But I always keep it.",1099800,1100900,"SPEAKER_05"
1102040,1105040,"Oh, oh, oh, no.",1101200,1105000,"SPEAKER_07"
1105040,1108040,"I must have forgotten to lock it.",1101200,1105000,"SPEAKER_07"
1108040,1111040,"And it's a bit late to do it now, isn't it?",1105700,1108200,"SPEAKER_07"
1111040,1112040,"But don't worry.",1108700,1121500,"SPEAKER_05"
1112040,1115040,"If I wanted to get in, I'd get in locks or no locks.",1108700,1121500,"SPEAKER_05"
1115040,1117040,"Oh, you lied to us, little my.",1108700,1121500,"SPEAKER_05"
1117040,1118040,"Of course, but so did you.",1108700,1121500,"SPEAKER_05"
1118040,1120040,"Telling me that stupid story.",1108700,1121500,"SPEAKER_05"
1120040,1122040,"Now we're even, right?",1108700,1121500,"SPEAKER_05"
1122040,1124040,"Now, listen, little my.",1108700,1121500,"SPEAKER_05"
1124040,1126040,"Don't ever tell anybody what you see over here.",1124000,1126500,"SPEAKER_07"
1126040,1128040,"All right.",1124000,1126500,"SPEAKER_07"
1128040,1133040,"This invention contains so many outstanding new features",1126700,1127500,"SPEAKER_05"

1137040,1140040,"But let me start with the most exciting part",1130900,1135900,"SPEAKER_07"
1140040,1143040,"of the whole construction.",1137900,1142000,"SPEAKER_07"
1147040,1152040,"It could go as a dream or rather the concept of a dream",1137900,1142000,"SPEAKER_07"
1152040,1157040,"thrilling, beautiful, impossible, dangerous.",1149800,1152500,"SPEAKER_07"

1173040,1175040,"Oh, why do you want to get off?",1156300,1157300,"SPEAKER_07"
1175040,1178040,"Aren't you having fun flying about up here?",1156300,1157300,"SPEAKER_07"
1178040,1180040,"I want to be on my own.",1156300,1157300,"SPEAKER_07"
