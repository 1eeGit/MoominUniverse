1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing the best song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:02,000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The snow was getting thicker on the ground and it was high time for the movements to start hibernating.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What are you doing now man, Alicia? What are you doing with these pine needles? That's what we always eat before we hibernate nobody knows why.

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So you're going to start hibernating? Yes tonight. Oh that's soon? Yes.

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm so glad I've come to see you today instead of leaving until tomorrow then.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I must say you came on just the right day, Alicia. We usually have a small party the night we start hibernating and you've arrived just in time.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh you mean I can stay for that woman, Mama?

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And by the way Alicia is a matter of interest, is the witch, sorry your grandmother I mean, know that you're here?

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No I'm afraid I didn't tell her, better for grownups not to know too much.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh do you say you're right?

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm afraid she's not very happy for me to come here to move in valley.

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Why ever not my dear?

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I guess she's afraid that if I start coming here to play I shall lose interest in studying hard at my witchcraft.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh but you've got a very long time to go before you're a witch?

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It takes anything between five to seven years nowadays.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Are you really sure that's what you want to be Alicia?

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Study something out. But I want to be a witch.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Perhaps you don't know but witches aren't terribly popular.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes I do but I won't be like that, I'll be popular.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hey, stop here.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're off to the moments?

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I thought you'd gone south already, last winter you'd gone before the snow started.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Not this year I promised Moomin.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Promise?

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I promised not to leave Moomin Valley until he went into hibernation.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Everybody seems to be here and somebody knew.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Who's that?

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Have a guess.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Very well then, it's Alicia that's my guess.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
How did you know?

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What? I'm right?

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes you are but I think you peaked and saw her earlier on.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I did it. I just named somebody I thought couldn't be here.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Clever huh?

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well she just happened to stop by. She's with Papa who's showing her around the house.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Is the witch here too?

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No she didn't tell the witch she was coming here.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just as well thank goodness.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Ah it's you snuffkin. I finally came over. I told you I would.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hi.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Remember our friend here? He's called Sniff.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hi, how do you do Sniff?

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Well you aren't going to use your magic to cast any spells and stuff are you?

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Actually they didn't eat just pine needles for dinner that evening.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They had lots of other nice things too. All cooked by Moomin Mama.

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Snuffkin I'd like to say how story I am.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why?

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I persuaded you to stay on here instead of going south as you'd planned.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm leaving tomorrow.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But the snow is quite deep.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't worry I'm used to deep snow.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm just worried Alicia will find it hard to get home in this.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Well she could spell the night here but of course tomorrow will be asleep for the winter so...

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Huh?

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hmm? Someones is a door.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll see who it is.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh hello. How are you?

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hello indeed my young man. My granddaughter is here isn't she?

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Who is it then Moomin?

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh my dear.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You must be Moomin Papa.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Now you listen to me Moomin Papa.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't want my granddaughter playing with your children under any circumstances.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Do I make myself quite clear?

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But Alicia likes playing with us.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Grandma!

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We're leaving. Can't I stand a little longer?

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hello you're most welcome to stay and have dinner with us.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't you know I'm a witch? I can't eat that sort of baby food.

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Alicia quite likes the food.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The pine needles look okay. The rest is yucky. Come Alicia.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Please let me stay grandma.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Not young lady. I've told you before which is never mixed with people like this.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And that goes for novice which is as well.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Never.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
With their knives they're really all grandma.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And I told you that's the trouble.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They are disgustingly sicknessly good.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You will hear a lot more about this when we get home.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Come on now.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's really cold out here and there's a lot more snow on the way.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
All right I'm coming grandma.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Coming.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh thank you.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Mum and Papa.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah?

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We understand each other now don't we?

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm sure you understand me.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Never mind about that.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You and your whole family are never to speak to my granddaughter again.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Is that understood?

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But grandma.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Mind what I say over a vengeance of touch will come upon you.

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Or even the revenge of a serious.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If you think cheap threats like that impress Mum and Papa.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You're making a grave mistake.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And Papa is a highly educated gentleman.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But I am a witch with three diplomas.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Maybe so.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But tell me how can three diplomas help you to get home with all this snow.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Ha! Child's play to an accredited witch.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Come, Alicia.

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've ever seen one of these before, a little pep square.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Is that really a witch's broom?

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, never.

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Let's go and see.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm ready.

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hold on, Ditalisia.

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay.

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Can you both ride on that broom?

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It looks pretty scrappy to me.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Could fall to pieces any minute.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Do drive slowly in this weather.

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, please don't fall off, Alicia.

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But terrible chatterboxes you all are.

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Please keep quiet out of you.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Are you ready, girl?

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah?

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Bet they'll never be able to take off.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Huh?

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Huh?

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh...

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What is it, Grandma?

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Nothing.

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh!

133
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh!

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh!

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh!

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Just what I thought, they're too heavy.

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Listen, I could take Alicia's place, I'm not too heavy.

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't worry, I'm happy to walk home, Grandma.

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't be so ridiculous, child.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You can't walk home in all this snow.

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You'll never make it.

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Only I had some skis.

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Come on, climb aboard.

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll try another spell.

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Grandma, are you worried because all those people are watching you?

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Shut up!

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I help you say the magic spell.

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh!

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh!

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh!

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh!

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh!

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh!

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh!

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Oh!

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh!

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh!

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh!

160
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh!

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh!

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
They're doing it!

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
They're doing it!

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh!

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh!

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh!

167
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What?

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh!

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh!

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh!

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh!

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Oh!

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Oh!

174
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh!

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh!

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Oh!

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh!

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Where'd we go?

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh!

180
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh!

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh!

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh!

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh!

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh!

185
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh!

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh!

187
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh!

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Oh!

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Oh!

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Oh!

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh!

192
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh!

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Oh!

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh!

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh!

196
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh!

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh!

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh!

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
She may have three diplomas, but I don't think she's very good, Mom.

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I wish they'd sing to the ground so I could fly that broom.

201
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Guess they're all right now, Mum and Papa.

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let's go back to our dinner.

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh!

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I forgot to thank them for asking me to stand at dinner!

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Thank them indeed!

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't think you're cut out to be a witch!

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, but Grandma, I don't want to be one!

208
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Well, I'm quite happy to help, but the path will certainly be a difficult one.

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh!

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh!

211
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh!

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Oh!

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh!

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:43,000
With Alessia and the witch gone home to the Valley of the Witches, Snuffkin departed for his trip south, and the Moomins went into hibernation.

215
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They certainly would have slept till the beginning of the spring as usual, but this year.

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Quite unexpectedly, something happened.

217
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh!

218
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh!

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Spring here already?

220
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There's someone at the window!

221
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh!

222
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's frozen shut!

223
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Hey!

224
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Why did you wake me up?

225
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Well, you shouldn't be asleep!

226
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Didn't you know Christmas is coming?

227
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's tomorrow, so there's not a minute to be lost!

228
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Christmas is coming tomorrow?

229
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But who on earth is that?

230
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Why?

231
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Who is Christmas?

232
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This isn't a joke moment!

233
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm not in the least ready!

234
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I've lost my mittens and Christmas is coming and I haven't got a fertry yet!

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
A fertry, I really must get a fertry!

236
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
How very odd!

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Why a fertry?

238
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hey!

239
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Why?

240
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, what's that, Moomins?

241
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Well, Christmas is almost coming and we don't have a fertry yet!

242
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Christmas?

243
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Hmm.

244
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Did you say Christmas is coming?

245
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes, and before that, one must have a fertry!

246
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What's this about a fertry?

247
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, you need one to protect ourselves against this Christmas person, Moomins Mama.

248
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I am not really quite clear on that point.

249
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But there's something awful that has to be kept away, right?

250
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I better go get a fertry!

251
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Ha!

252
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
About time you Moomins got up?

253
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
How are you going to see?

254
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Pretty good fertry, Dad!

255
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Well, thank you, Gavsie, but could you tell me something?

256
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What is one supposed to do with it?

257
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

258
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, really, Moomins Papa!

259
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The way you can joke with such a straight face!

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Joke?

261
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Eh?

262
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Love to stay, but I haven't even finished cooking yet!

263
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I wasn't joking.

264
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
No one believed me either!

265
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Would you like a little more, young man?

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
No, thank you very much. I'm really nice and warm again now.

267
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I saw Moomins Papa and Moomins bring up a big tree!

268
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But what is one supposed to do with it?

269
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Don't you know?

270
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No!

271
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why are you decorated as beautifully as you can?

272
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Really?

273
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Christmas is coming, so I better be off!

274
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Everyone's talking of Christmas!

275
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
By now, I've got a long way to go!

276
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Take care, dear!

277
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Hello!

278
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Hello!

279
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Bye-bye!

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Bye-bye!

281
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Good-bye!

282
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Who was that?

283
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't know!

284
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
He was in a hurry to get somewhere before Christmas!

285
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So I gave him some tea!

286
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That was nice!

287
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And he told us what to do with the fir tree!

288
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What did he say?

289
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
To decorate it beautifully!

290
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Decorate it, but why should we do that, Mama?

291
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I guess we must decorate the tree to make sure we keep Christmas happy!

292
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes, you're right!

293
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We'd better start doing it right away!

294
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes, I'm sure there's another moment to lose!

295
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
No!

296
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Mama!

297
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes, dear!

298
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
They also say we have to cook lots of food for Christmas!

299
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Goodness!

300
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Well, at least he won't be eating us then!

301
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Here!

302
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Thank you, Snorkmaid!

303
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh!

304
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The ship means rather a lot to me!

305
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It will look fantastic on the tree, Papa!

306
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes, dear, I suppose you're right!

307
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Oh!

308
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Why don't we put this at the top?

309
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This is Mama's!

310
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't worry!

311
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Mmm, that looks beautiful!

312
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Listen, everybody!

313
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas, too!

314
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Really, Mama?

315
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes, I do!

316
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas, too!

317
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Really, Mama?

318
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't wonder what this Christmas will be like!

319
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What if it's an awful greedy, beastly monster like the grove?

320
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Don't worry, Snorkmaid!

321
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We'll give him lots of presents and stuff him full of food!

322
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Have you thought of any presents for Christmas yet?

323
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't know what to give him!

324
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Look, a seashell!

325
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh, that's a beauty!

326
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, look, Mama, what I got for Christmas!

327
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm going to give him a pretty lure for fishing!

328
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm giving him this book!

329
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Great presents!

330
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm sure he'll be very happy with the moment family and not Thomas at all!

331
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I think Christmas will come any moment now!

332
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So do I!

333
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, dear!

334
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I do hope he likes my pumpkin pie!

335
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
He will!

336
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Imagine everyone in Moomin Valley being frightened!

337
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Mmm!

338
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Mmm!

339
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Are you sleepy?

340
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes, I am!

341
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I can't stay this scared for much longer!

342
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Better come before all the food freezes!

343
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh!

344
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
He's coming!

345
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I never thought Christmas could be that small!

346
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Merry Christmas!

347
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Merry Christmas! Is that what he is?

348
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Well, it's just what you say!

349
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
All of my life I have dreamed of seeing all this up close, honestly!

350
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I never really thought a Christmas tree could be this beautiful!

351
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Brought my friends, too!

352
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You're all very welcome!

353
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, thank you!

354
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Hear that, everybody?

355
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We're all very welcome!

356
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Woo!

357
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Man, let's get him!

358
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There's some wonderful things here!

359
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah!

360
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh, what a lot of food you've made!

361
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes, all the food there is for Christmas!

362
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And are those real presents?

363
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yeah!

364
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
All of my life, I've sort of wondered about those things called presents!

365
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Papa, I don't think these creatures are Christmas!

366
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Neither do I!

367
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You look sleepy!

368
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I am!

369
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Must be well past midnight!

370
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What is Christmas doing, Mama?

371
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Aren't you sleepy, too, little ones?

372
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Sleepy with a wonderful Christmas tree like this to look at!

373
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Hey, Papa!

374
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What is it?

375
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

376
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Hmm, maybe.

377
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Nobody can get really angry this late at night, surely!

378
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We'll close the doors and perhaps we'll be safe inside!

379
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm sure you're right!

380
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Listen, my friends, we'd like to give you the tree and the food and the presents!

381
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What?

382
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
All of this?

383
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
For us?

384
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes, we want to sleep!

385
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We're far more sleepy than scared!

386
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Snort, Ma'am?

387
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh, I see here yet!

388
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
No, but we decided to go back to hibernating!

389
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Bye-bye!

390
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I thought Christmas tree should have a star on top!

391
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I don't think it makes any difference, you know?

392
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
A nice rose is just as good as a star!

393
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Look at that!

394
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And apparently it didn't make any difference at all!

395
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Because the moon and family slept as peacefully as ever!

396
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
All through the night, without Christmas!

397
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Coming!

398
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Anywhere!

399
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Hi!

400
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And apparently it didn't make any difference at all!

401
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Because the moon and family slept as peacefully as ever!

402
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
All through the night, without Christmas!

403
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Coming anywhere near them!

404
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So probably, he went someplace else!

405
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements!

406
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements!

407
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
They're always happy and always at play!

408
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The movements are having fun day after day!

409
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The movements!

410
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The movements!

411
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The movements!
