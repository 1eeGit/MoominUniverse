1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:06,000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What?

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What?

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:20,900
Big explosions could be heard in Moomin Valley almost every night, and Moomin couldn't sleep

9
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,900
awake.

10
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:29,680
Usually there was just one, but sometimes even two.

11
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
You heard it too, Moomin, pop up.

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,480
Yes, those loud bangs are kicking me awake.

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,760
I wonder if there'll be another one.

14
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,960
They seem to be coming from the north.

15
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,680
Hmm, he's sti-thought.

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,800
Or they could be coming from lonely mountains.

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,360
If you ask me, I believe they're the work of the witch.

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
The witch?

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,560
But witches don't make a lot of noise.

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
Never know.

21
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,200
They're sneaky characters.

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,960
Tomorrow I'll have a few words with the inspector, except to him to put a stop to it.

23
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,800
Papa, why would the witch want to make explosions?

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Why not?

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,320
The first bang wakes me up, and then I lie awake waiting for the second one, which might

26
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,920
not come at all.

27
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,760
The bags might not come from Moomin Valley at all, and they might be just an echo off

28
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
the mountains.

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Do you think so?

30
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
Yes, I do.

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,520
Well, at least that's what Snuffkin thinks.

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,800
And the explosions might come from the sea.

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,280
That's what Snuffkin figured.

34
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,360
He thought it might be pirates or something making the noises.

35
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,040
He's already had pirates, and they went a long time ago.

36
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,520
I'm plumping for the witch.

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
There's no doubt in my mind.

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,080
What are you doing out here?

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,920
We're waiting for another explosion, Mama.

40
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,480
You're waiting, Vane, dear.

41
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
No, no, no, no, that Moomin, Mama.

42
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,720
Well, we had two explosions last night, and we've never had double explosions for two

43
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,720
nights in a row.

44
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,560
Until now, that is.

45
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
You heard that.

46
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,960
It clearly came from over there.

47
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Over there?

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Oh, no.

49
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,320
It certainly came from over there.

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,760
You couldn't mistake it.

51
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
I'm sure of it.

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:12,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

53
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,840
Good morning, Moomin, lovely day.

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,280
Good morning, Snuffkin.

55
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,760
You look very sleepy.

56
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,960
So would you be opposed to explosions that kept you awake for most of the night?

57
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,280
Those explosions are really very hard, aren't they?

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,760
They certainly are.

59
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,760
Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,040
Moomin, Papa's convinced that she's the one who's making the bangs.

61
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,540
I think he's wrong there.

62
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,040
That's what I thought, but there's nothing I could say to convince him.

63
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,040
So now I'm going to find out for myself.

64
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,040
You can certainly ask her, but do you really trust a witch to tell you the truth?

65
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
Do you, a woman?

66
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,040
But witches don't have to lie, Shirley.

67
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Is that you, Little My?

68
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
And where are you two going?

69
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Little My.

70
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,040
Are you tailing me full time or what?

71
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Yes, whenever you're sneaking off somewhere, I'm not sneaking, I'm just walking.

72
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Well, I've never seen anyone walking in such a sneaky way.

73
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,040
Last time the witch tried to keep you from waking up, didn't she?

74
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
So?

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,040
So you think now she's trying to keep you from sleeping?

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Well, if she makes the explosions, it's always possible that someone else is the target.

77
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,040
We know very little about witches, and those bangs are probably nothing to do with the movements.

78
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,040
I think you guessed right, but try telling that to the movements.

79
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
We don't think it's like that at all.

80
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,040
Wonder if she's at home.

81
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,040
If she isn't, we can visit Alicia instead.

82
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Better ask Alicia than the witch.

83
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Anyway, she's more likely to tell us the truth.

84
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Yes, you're right.

85
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,040
Look, you don't seem to realize this is a witch's house.

86
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,040
What do you mean by that?

87
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,040
I'll tell you what I mean.

88
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,040
What I mean is, I don't want to be seen talking with goody-goodies like the moments.

89
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,040
You think they'll ruin your reputation, is that why you're so worried?

90
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
Hmm.

91
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Uh, there's just something very important we wanted to ask you.

92
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,040
And then we'll leave straight away.

93
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,040
That room upstairs, is that Alicia's?

94
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
It is.

95
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Is Alicia there now?

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
No, she isn't.

97
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Where did she go?

98
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
She went to get some wolf's vein.

99
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
When will she be coming back?

100
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,040
You're not going to stop her studying.

101
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,040
No, we wanted to ask her something about that loud noise we hear every night.

102
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Ah, that one.

103
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Hey, are you the one making the bangs?

104
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,040
I don't make explosions.

105
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Who is it then?

106
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
I really don't know.

107
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,040
But why did you say that one then?

108
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Because the explosions bother me, too.

109
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,040
You think they're coming from near here?

110
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,040
I think they're coming from far away from the sea, maybe.

111
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
That's what snuffkin' things, too.

112
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Any sound from the sea echoes off Lonely Mountain,

113
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,040
so you think that's where it comes from?

114
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Why is young man, a few days ago,

115
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,040
I went all the way over to the beach to see what was happening.

116
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,040
After a whole day's witching and casting magic spells,

117
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,040
one needs one sleep, you know.

118
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
So, what did you find them?

119
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,040
Nothing at all.

120
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
There was only one explosion that night,

121
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,040
so when I got there on my brun, there was nothing more to see.

122
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Then we still have no idea who makes the bangs.

123
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,040
No, and I'm really upset you thought it was me.

124
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
When a witch creates an explosion,

125
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,040
it doesn't sound anything like a camel cough.

126
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
I can tell you.

127
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Camel cough, I like that.

128
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Thank you very much, Snork Maiden.

129
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,040
This year I want to grow some black tulips.

130
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Is there really such a thing as a black tulip?

131
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
There's such a dark red, they look black.

132
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Oh, I see.

133
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Although it wouldn't really surprise me, Snork Maiden,

134
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
if there really were black ones somewhere.

135
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
We must ask the hamulineal now.

136
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Oh, yes.

137
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,040
I know it's embarrassing, but I'm so excited.

138
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,040
I can't go to sleep at night.

139
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Oh, I have no problem going to sleep at night,

140
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
but that noise wakes me up, Pamuline.

141
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
What noise is that?

142
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,040
I told you that noise.

143
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Oh, I see.

144
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
You're talking about the explosion.

145
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,040
You know anything about it, Mr. Hemuline.

146
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,040
No, nothing at all.

147
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
No, those bangs are not what keeps me awake,

148
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
moment papa.

149
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,040
No, I'm waiting for a pie from the botanist federation.

150
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
Reply.

151
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Yes, don't you remember a few months ago?

152
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Housecrange, I thought I told you about it.

153
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Well, I certainly told everyone else I know.

154
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,040
I sent them a brand new species.

155
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
New species.

156
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,040
I've never seen anything like it in my whole life.

157
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
A new wild orchid.

158
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,040
I'm so excited I can hardly speak.

159
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Really?

160
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
A new wild orchid.

161
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,040
How very interesting.

162
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Yes, isn't it?

163
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,040
Oh, it would be such a great honor for me

164
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,040
and for everyone else that they call it orchidokahemulinesis

165
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
or hemiliformis.

166
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,040
No, I'm sure they will.

167
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,040
So now you understand why I've had so many sleepless nights.

168
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Yes, indeed.

169
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Trouble is they should have answered by now.

170
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,040
Maybe they're still trying to decide what to call it.

171
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,040
Maybe they can't decide between orchidokahemulinesis

172
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,040
and orchidokahemuliformis.

173
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
Mmm.

174
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Oh.

175
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
What is it?

176
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Now I see at last I understand.

177
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,040
I am getting no reply from the botanist federation

178
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,040
because it is not a new species.

179
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Oh, of course somebody's already found it.

180
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
Oh.

181
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
It is still too funny.

182
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
No, no.

183
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Stupid I am.

184
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,040
This is the end of me as a scientist of course.

185
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
Calm down.

186
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Don't upset yourself, Mr. Himulun.

187
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,040
Everybody will laugh at me and call me Mr. Himulinesis.

188
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
Now listen, Mr. Himulun.

189
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
The reply is a long time coming

190
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,040
because they must examine your plant most carefully

191
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
before making a decision.

192
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,040
They must read all the books first to be sure.

193
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,040
You really think so, Mum and Batman?

194
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Could it really take so long, do you think?

195
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Of course, these things take time.

196
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
When did you send it off?

197
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
A month ago.

198
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
There you are, that's no time at all.

199
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
You have to learn to be patient, Emulun.

200
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
You think so?

201
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Oh, I feel better already.

202
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
Oh, I'm so glad you feel happier, Mr. Himulun.

203
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Don't you worry, my friend.

204
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Mama, great news dear.

205
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,040
Mr. Himulun has discovered a completely new plant

206
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
and is going to be called Himulinesis.

207
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Oh, that's wonderful.

208
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Congratulations, Mr. Himulun.

209
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
Oh, well, it isn't official yet.

210
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,040
No, they're just thinking about the name still.

211
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Give them time.

212
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
We should have a party for Mr. Himulun.

213
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
Shouldn't we, Papa?

214
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
What?

215
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Oh, yes, indeed.

216
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
When, Papa, tonight?

217
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
Hmm, let me think.

218
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,040
We should wait just a little bit longer perhaps.

219
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,040
Oh, why do you say that?

220
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Mr. Himulun, you know that rare plant you found?

221
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Does it have any flowers?

222
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
But, of course.

223
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Are they pretty?

224
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Very pretty.

225
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Yes, just like you, Snorke Maiden.

226
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Oh, Mr. Himulun.

227
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

228
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Hey, look, Snorke Maiden.

229
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Why don't we go and find out about those explosions tonight, huh?

230
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
All right.

231
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
You'll need me to find the way.

232
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
You want to come along?

233
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
You bet.

234
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
They come late at night.

235
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,040
I won't go to sleep, bad.

236
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,040
What do you think, Snorke Maiden?

237
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
I'm not sure.

238
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
Isn't there anything you can do to change your mind, movement?

239
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
I don't know.

240
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Listen, little Maiden.

241
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
You have to be careful.

242
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
This could be dangerous.

243
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
Obviously, or I would.

244
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
Come, would I, spoil my sleep?

245
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Well, stick close to us, then.

246
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Yes, do that.

247
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,040
I also went down to the beach late last night

248
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,040
to try and find out what was happening.

249
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
And while I was there, I saw the witch flying around

250
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
on her broomstick.

251
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
Oh, really?

252
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Why didn't you tell me so I could have come along?

253
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
I could hide better than you.

254
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,040
You're so white.

255
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
See, movement?

256
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,040
I'm not big in way like you.

257
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Oh, there's someone coming.

258
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Who?

259
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Oh, there's someone coming.

260
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Who?

261
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,040
It's Alicia.

262
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,040
Hey, Alicia.

263
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,040
Hi, Alicia.

264
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,040
Oh, my man.

265
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Hey, Alicia.

266
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
How are you?

267
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Have you three come here to play with me?

268
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,040
No, I'm afraid we have, but it's good to see you.

269
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
Yes, Alicia.

270
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
Yes?

271
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Has your grandmother been kind to you since your last visit to us?

272
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
Very kind.

273
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,040
She's been treating me very well.

274
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Ever since I stopped coming to see you.

275
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,040
Oh, good, but we do miss you, Alicia.

276
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Oh, I miss you, too.

277
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,040
But I must keep my promise to her.

278
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
She'd be upset if I broke it.

279
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
What are these wings?

280
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
They're herbs.

281
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
Herbs are very important for a witch.

282
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
And frogs, bellies, and lizard stales.

283
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,040
They're important, too, of course.

284
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
I think that's licorice.

285
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
That's right.

286
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Very clever, Snuffkin.

287
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,040
We use that for heartburn and coughs.

288
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,040
They smell quite nice.

289
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,040
And it also stops cows from giving their milk.

290
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
I see.

291
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
That's interesting.

292
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
Oh, it's a ride.

293
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Hi!

294
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Hello, Mr. Hillman.

295
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Splendid days, eh?

296
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,040
Hello, Mr. Hamilton.

297
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Don't you work so hard?

298
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,040
Yeah, I guess I do with that.

299
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Wait, stop.

300
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,040
What is it, Mr. Hamilton?

301
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,040
My letter. I just want my letter.

302
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
There isn't one.

303
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
But why not?

304
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,040
You didn't have any yesterday or the day before.

305
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
Yeah, I know that. Nobody's written to you.

306
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
That's why.

307
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Well, somebody should have written.

308
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Are you quite, quite sure that you've gone through your bag properly?

309
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Don't you know I'm expecting an important letter from an important scientist?

310
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
It must be in your bag.

311
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
Ah, all right, then. Go ahead.

312
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
What?

313
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Well, you don't seem to trust me to do my job properly, Mr. Hamilton.

314
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,040
Go ahead. Have a look for yourself, then.

315
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,040
Oh, but of course I trust you.

316
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Sorry.

317
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
No, no. You better have a look.

318
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
What do you think I do?

319
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
Steam them open and read them at night?

320
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
No.

321
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Oh, you seem to have a lot of letters today.

322
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Oh, I really think I should ask for a higher salary.

323
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
I deserve it.

324
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,040
I'm just starving.

325
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,040
I might have to go over and visit the moments in a minute.

326
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Oh.

327
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,040
I'm sleepy, too. I could go on sleeping.

328
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Oh!

329
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
What do you think you're doing?

330
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

331
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,040
There's nothing else out here and you didn't see me?

332
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
I'm sorry.

333
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Oh, dear. What does this matter with you?

334
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Is this place called Moomin Valley?

335
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Yes. That's right.

336
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,040
At last I found it. I never thought I'd really make it.

337
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Excuse me. Are you all right?

338
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Doctor me, miss.

339
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Oh, tell me what's bothering you.

340
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Oh, she's ill. She's got a fever.

341
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
Please leave me alone.

342
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,040
But you can lie here. You should be in bad young lady.

343
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Do you know a man called Hamilton?

344
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Yes. Have you walked all the way to Moomin Valley to visit him?

345
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,040
So I have come to the right place. He does live here.

346
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Oh, yes. He lives very close to here.

347
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,040
I'm so glad I must see him immediately here.

348
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,040
Oh, what shall I do? I must do something.

349
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Come here, someone. Someone help me.

350
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,040
Oh, my goodness.

351
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Help! Anyone help! Help me somebody!

352
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:03,040
Papa! Papa!

353
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,040
He's up in the guest room if you want him. Mama's there as well.

354
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,040
What for?

355
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,040
I just rescued a girl, you know.

356
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
A girl? Did you sniff?

357
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,040
That's right. Very pretty too. She's ill and I put her to bed myself.

358
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,040
I'm going to see her. Me too.

359
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,040
I want another look as well.

360
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,040
First, we must bring her fever down.

361
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,040
I think you're right.

362
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,040
Yes?

363
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,040
Sniff just told us about her.

364
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Oh dear, she unconscious.

365
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,040
Yes. Where'd she come from?

366
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,040
We don't know a little, Maya, but Sniff said she'd come here to visit the hemeland.

367
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,040
That's right. Snort Maiden's gone to get him.

368
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
She's pretty, isn't she?

369
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
You're right. Very.

370
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,040
By the way, Moomin, what did the witch say?

371
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Oh dear, must I really run like this?

372
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Where is she visiting her young girl?

373
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Well, if she's sick, why don't you give her some medicine?

374
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
I don't know any young girl's apart from her.

375
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Don't. Just keep running.

376
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,040
I told you. I do not know this person. Maybe she's changed.

377
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,040
I've already told you. I have never known any young girls.

378
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Then why do you think she'd want to come to visit you, hemeland?

379
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
She's a botanist.

380
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,040
And obviously she's heard of me and wants to come and see the famous hemeland for herself.

381
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Oh dear, she can tell us when she wakes up.

382
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,040
We must leave her now so that grandma's medicine can work.

383
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
I think I'll be getting home.

384
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,040
Oh, we couldn't let you go just like that. Please stay and have some tea with us.

385
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Thank you, but no, I have some plans to press.

386
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,040
And you're sure you're quite sure you don't know this girl?

387
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Absolutely certain.

388
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,040
I really must go.

389
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
I'd forgotten all about the bangs.

390
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,040
Well, we haven't snuffed Ken and I. I'm going to look for them tonight.

391
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,040
I'd like to come too, but I can't.

392
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,040
I'm going with them. Are you snort maiden?

393
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,040
You'll be hiding on the beach in the middle of the night?

394
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Yes, and then we'll rush off to where the bangs are coming from as soon as we hear them.

395
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
That's the plan.

396
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
Oh, I'd really love to come.

397
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,040
I'd rather go to bed. I'd be a bit scared of the beach in the middle of the night.

398
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,040
After all, it's my duty to stay here with Mum and Mama.

399
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,040
Are you coming, Sniff?

400
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Certainly not. Not me.

401
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,040
This just occurred to me. That's why she's here.

402
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Ah.

403
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Here, you better take this moment. You might get very hungry.

404
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Oh, thank you, Mama.

405
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,040
A midnight snack. I really envy you.

406
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Well, Grandpa, why don't you come with us?

407
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Oh, there's nothing I'd love more.

408
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,040
But I'd better not tonight. Right, Mama?

409
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Oh, definitely not.

410
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,040
What would I do if something happened to the girl while you were away?

411
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
Exactly.

412
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,040
All right, Papa. We'll find out about the bangs for you.

413
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Thank you, Momenta.

414
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Good.

415
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,040
I think we should save this food for a while. We might have to wait a long time for the explosions.

416
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Then they might not come tonight.

417
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Stop stuffing yourself, Mum, and the rest is for a snuffkin and me.

418
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,040
But you can't eat anymore? Yes, I can.

419
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,040
We must share it in equal parts, otherwise it's not fair.

420
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,040
I think it should be shared in proportion to how big one is.

421
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Hmm.

422
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Hmm?

423
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,040
Oh, where did that come from? From the sea.

424
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,040
Keep a sharp lookout. Look over there.

425
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
What is it?

426
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Uh-oh! Wow!

427
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Oh!

428
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
That's what I call fireworks.

429
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Come on!

430
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Somebody must be out there in a boat!

431
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
There's a boat!

432
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,040
The fireworks must have come from there!

433
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Hey! Come ashore!

434
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Is that the henman you like?

435
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,040
No, I don't think so. It looks like him, but he was much younger.

436
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:20,040
And so as a result of their excursion to the beach, they finally learned that the big bangs that had been waking everyone up were fireworks.

437
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:25,040
They also learned that the fireworks were coming from a boat far out to sea.

438
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:30,040
But the man who had sent them up disappeared into the night.

439
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:39,040
They loved the laughter and they loved the living the movements.

440
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:46,040
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

441
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,040
They're always happy and goes at play.

442
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:57,040
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

443
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,040
The movements.

444
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:07,040
The movements.
