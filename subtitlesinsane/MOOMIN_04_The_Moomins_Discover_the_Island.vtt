    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're here for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
They are the movements. You can fly just like a bird, sing the best song ever.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There were the moments, there were the moments, there were the moments.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
There were the moments, there were the moments.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:01:49.799

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.560
boat they'd found washed up on the beach.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.400
They didn't know where they were going, and thought it would be much more fun that way.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.040
Mama, we're not going away forever, you know.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.040
I hope not.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.599
I don't think we'll need all these pots and pans.

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.659
It's best to be prepared at sea.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.259
What do you mean?

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.060
Well, you're only complaining if you don't get a hot meal.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.219
I never complain.

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.340
And you know how hungry the sea air made you all last time we went out on a boat.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.340
You'd have been glad of food then.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.139
Hmm, you got to rough it a bit if you want an adventure.

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.819
Yes, but it will be more fun with coffee and pancakes.

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, pancakes. Aren't you too ready yet?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Hello, Mummian! Hi, Snorkvagan!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Whoa!

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Oh!

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Oh!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Oh!

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Oh!

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Oh! Whoa!

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Ugh! Ugh!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Ugh!

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Must you use that ladder?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm all right!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Mom, and you're gonna hurt yourself one of these days!

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
It's good practice!

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Is Snork coming with us?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.199
He says he hasn't got time for sailing boats at the moment.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:12.919
I'd much rather a real sailing boat than a paper flying ship any day.

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:17.759
Are mom aren't Papa ready yet?

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.240
They're packing a path the kitchen.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.360
Oh, it's too full.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.000
Have we got to take all that with us?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Mama thinks it's better to be safe than sorry, and she's usually right.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Tell me, Moomin, where exactly are we going?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We haven't decided yet.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:47.000
That's right. Wait and see. Oh, Mr. Hamillin! Oh! Have you found a rare plan for your collection yet?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Unfortunately not.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
There are lots of things to do.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I'm not sure if I can find it.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I'm sure I can find it.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I'm sure I can find it.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Mr. Hamillin!

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Oh! Have you found a rare plan for your collection yet?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Unfortunately not.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
There are lots of these in Mumen Valley already.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Goodness, where are you taking all that?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
We're going sailing.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
How exciting, charting new seas and exploring desert islands.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I have an owl.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:39.000
If I help you load up the boat can I please come with you?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Captain the bridge! Man the yard arm!

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Hankers away! Sailors beware! Spice the manbrace! All hands on deck! Full speed ahead!

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Hey Sniff, any son of the mule? Not yet. It's a great day to go sailing. I wonder where we're going.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I don't have any idea. I don't actually like sailing much.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Do you get sick?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Well, not really sick. It's just that I can't swim.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And if it's rough, it frightens me and I panic a bit.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
It looks like it's going to stay calm.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So don't worry.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Right, that's the lot.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Now, all aboard.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Mama, little Mai,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Stafkin,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Mumin,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Snork Maiden,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and Mr. Hambylin' of course.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Isn't he a bit old for adventures?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Not at all.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
No, Mumin Papa has promised to find a deserted island

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:47.000
where I shall search for rare plants. Oh, there's no room. Don't be silly, sniff, of course there is.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000
It looks very full, almost thinking.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
There's no way this boat could sink.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Now come on, get in.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Oh. It looks very full, almost thinking. There's no way this boat could sink.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Now come on, get him.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Oh.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Really?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I promise it'll be all right.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Won't it, Papa?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Well, if it stays like this, it will, moment.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I'll come next time.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Let's go, moment, Papa. He's just a scary cat.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.240
Hmm. We'll go without woman, Papa. He's just a scary cat.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.240
Mm.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.279
We'll go without you then, Sniff.

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:31.160
I think that will be best.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.639
Anyway, someone did better stay and look after Mom and House,

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:36.199
and it might just as well be me.

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.040
That's very thoughtful of you.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.600
There's a pancake on the kitchen table

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.560
that you can have for lunch.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.160
Thank you, Mom and Mama.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:49.000
Have a nice trip.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I wish Nuford come. He's a big softy.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Well, he's not very good at swimming,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:36.079
and he doesn't eat rather a lot. This is the life, isn't it, Mama? It certainly is, dear.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.079
Oh, look, not a breath of wind. Shall I start rowing, Papa?

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:45.519
Yes, you'd better get snuffkin' to help you.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.800
Aye-aye, Captain.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.319
Tardly moving! You'll have to do better than that.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.720
We're doing our best.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.319
You two would be useless as galley slaves. It's good that we're not then, isn't it?

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.480
So then, what's your excuse?

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.000
It's not easy rowing against the tide. You try it.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
No, dear, at this rate, I should be lucky to find one rare plant.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Well, Mr. Hamlin, you could always try collecting some seaweed instead. There's plenty of that.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I have heard tales that if you whistle, those who perished at sea will send you a wind.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.360
Land! A Hoi! Look, Moomin, Papa!

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:31.360
That's too small to be any good.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:52.000
You're right. Hey, look, Papa! We're moving again!

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
The tides turned and the winds up.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.799
What a beautiful island!

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:03.000
And a perfect place to land, too.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Oh, I bet this place has got some rare plants.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Be careful when you explore. There could be wild animals there.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Now if someone will go and collect some wood, I'll get a fire started.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I've had none of you will say no to coffee and pancakes.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Watch me, you land lovers. I'll go and pull the boat ashore.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Hmm, I suppose you will ride. This will come in handy. As I said, Papa, it's always better to ruff it with a little bit of luxury.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I wonder if we're the first to set foot on the island.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Thank you, children.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Is there anything else you want us to do?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
No, I don't think so.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Is it okay if I go explore the island?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Of course, off you go.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Coming, Snort made up.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I'll stay and help Mum and Mama with the cooking.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.559
Mama, you said we needed firewood, is this enough?

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:07.559
My goodness for a lot.

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:15.039
You know, I don't think anyone lives on this island.

00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:19.039
I haven't seen anyone unless they're hiding in the bushes.

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:20.840
I've seen someone.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.240
Oh yeah? Who?

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.840
Well, they weren't very big.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.500
What do you mean? This big? Well, they weren't very big. What do you mean?

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.500
This big?

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.500
Well, same as me.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.500
What did they look like?

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.500
Sort of white and ghostly and not very friendly looking either, Moomin.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.000
Well, you probably just thought you saw something a little mic.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.500
I did see them. I did too!

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.500
Keep your hair on.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.000
I'm not saying you didn't see anything.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Goodness, this is magnificent. Oh, what a find!

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And what's this? Yes. Oh, well, well, well, well.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.840
I've never seen such rare and beautiful plants.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.600
Huh?

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.600
Whoa.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.600
Whoa.

00:11:33.799 --> 00:11:34.799
Whoa.

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:35.799
Whoa.

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:36.799
Whoa.

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:37.799
Whoa.

00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:38.799
Whoa.

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:39.799
Whoa.

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:40.799
Whoa.

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:41.799
Whoa.

00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:42.799
Whoa.

00:11:42.799 --> 00:11:43.799
Whoa.

00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:44.799
Whoa.

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:46.919
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Well, what's this? Goodness, it's a barometer. Now let's see.

00:11:46.919 --> 00:11:49.919
Rain and storm. Probably broken.

00:11:57.919 --> 00:12:00.559
Oh, hello. Who are you?

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:04.559
Oh, I see. This is your barometer, isn't it? Now watch it.

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:07.000
Mind you don't travel on those flowers, will you?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Oh, no, no, no, no. They're coming to get me. Don't go away. Don't go away.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I think what little my saw was a haddy fatner.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
They're not ghosts. Are they? Snuff can?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
No, they look kind of like it, but they're really harmless enough movement.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Oh, leave me alone!

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Oh, dear, what on earth was that?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:13:05.000
It sounded like Mr. Hamulin! Don't get away, oh, oh, oh, baby, please. That's it! That's what I saw! It's Mr. Hamulin.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Help! Get me down!

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Why are they after you, Mr. Hamulin?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
What'd you do to them?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I don't know! I just tapped on this post and asked them to be careful with the flowers.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
They seem a bit angry to me.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Well, then I tapped the marombin in the tent.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.799
I'm going to get you a little bit more. I don't know. I just tapped on this post and asked them to be careful with the flowers.

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:28.200
They seem a bit angry to me.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.600
Well, then I tapped the marrometer to check the weather and they came at me.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.899
Well, I don't think it's a flower's a mad about.

00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:36.500
Maybe they thought you were trying to steal the marrometer.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.600
I don't want it to keep it.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.399
My goodness, I'm collecting flowers, not marrometers.

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:43.399
Well, hang on.

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:47.000
I can't hang on much longer, hurry, please.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
They don't look so easily frightened.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
No, now let me think.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Hurry, I'm slipping.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
I've got it, Mr. Hemmulin.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
The hadifattoners can't see or hear very well,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
but they are very sensitive.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
We'll have to try and frighten them.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.519
I suggest you shake the post as hard as you can

00:14:08.759 --> 00:14:11.000
Harder harder mr.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.539
Look they can feel the ground moving keep going mr. Hemmielin

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Are you sure this will work Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm getting really tired. Her big sausage, if I can't. They're not going, self-kin.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Are you sure this will work?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Yeah.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Oh!

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
You can stop now, Mr. Hemmilen.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Mr. Hemmilen!

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Oh, dear!

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Hey, are you all right, Mr. Hemmilen?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
What disgusting creatures!

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I have a good mind to take their precious barometer.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
I don't think that's such a good idea.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
It's no good anyway. It's not working.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
How do you know that, Mr. Hemmulin?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Look, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
But according to this barometer, it should be pouring down with rain.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
This is the way to explore real home cooking.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
It just takes a little thought.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And woman papa is always prepared, aren't you dear?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Double zero. It can't get any lower than that.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
What does that mean?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
If it was working, it would mean we'd be in for a terrible storm.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.299
Hmm. I think the reading might be right after all, Mr. Hemmulun.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.799
See the way the sky is darkening.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.500
Look at those storm clouds. We better go before it's too late.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:01.000
But there won't be time to get home. We'll be shipwreck moving, Papa.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Surely there's still time.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
We don't want to go back to Moomin Valley yet. We've only explored half the island.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Besides, you never know what we might find, Snort Maiden.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
I wanted to get my hands on those haddy fat nurse!

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
That's the last thing I wanted to do little mind, the very last!

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
I think we ought to leave now.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
What do you think, Mama?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Well, you're the captain, dear. It's up to you. So I am. Now, let you think mama well you're the captain dear it's up to you so I am now let me think Oh, can we? Yes, but we must put the tent up before it starts raining. What tent?

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Always be prepared.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
That's my motto.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
You're very clever to think of everything.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
First, we must lower the sails and pull them up.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Oh, can we?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Yes, but we must put the tent up before it starts raining.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
What tent?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Always be prepared.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
That's my motto.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
You're very clever to think of everything.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:28.000
First, we must lower the sails and pull the boat up so that she's out of harm's way. Oh!

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
That should do it! Oh!

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Well done, everybody.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
It should be safe here.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Now hurry with the tent, the storm's nearly here.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Are you all right, Mr. Hemmulan?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
You stay here and rest, eh?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
We'll manage without you.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
I am a bit tired.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
You get your breath back first, but don't forget to tie the boat to that tree before you come up.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
It looks bad. A real humdinger.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
You can trust me.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Right, let's get that tent up.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Oh, dear, what a day! Oh dear, what a day! Oh dear, what a day! Oh dear, what a day!

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Oh dear, what a day!

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Oh dear, what a day!

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Oh dear, what a day!

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Oh dear, what a day!

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Oh dear, what a day!

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Oh dear, what a day! Oh dear, what's this here?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Oh, yes! Well, fans, see that I've never seen one of these before.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Snuffkin?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
What's happening? It's coming good. What's happening?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
It's coming really fast.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Look at the rain over the sea.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
We're gonna get soaked if we stay here.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Just a minute.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
But we'll get wet.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
I know, but it's so exciting.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Things which you have no control over.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
You can see this great big storm coming towards you,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
and you can't do anything about it.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
No.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
You have to time it just right.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
When to make a run for shelter, you mean?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
I knew you'd understand.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.480
I wonder what the haddy Fatterners are doing.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.880
Waiting for the thunderstorm.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.880
Why?

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.119
Because they get energy from the electricity and the lightning.

00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:34.119
Really?

00:19:34.119 --> 00:19:36.119
That's it!

00:19:36.119 --> 00:19:46.000
Come on! I've never seen rain like this. It'll be over soon enough, Momen. You're dressed, Mom.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
I know.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
It's all right.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
I'll look after you.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
I know.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
I know.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
I know.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
I know.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
I know.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I know.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
I know. I know. Oh!

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
It's all right.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:46.000
I'll look after you. The That was a close one. Too close. I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
That was a close one. Too close. I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
What a find I made today!

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:40.000
What a find I made today! If, like the movements and their friends, you're stranded on the desert island in a huge storm.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.720
All you can do is wait until it's blown itself out.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:49.000
But what if the waves are so high that your boat has caught up and washed out to sea?

00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:15.000
That is a different story altogether. They love the laughter and they love the living the moments

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the moments The movements. They're always happy and always at play.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
The movements.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
The movements.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
They love the laughter and they love the living.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
The movements. They love the living, the movements

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000
We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
They're always happy and goes at play

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:07.000
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements The Move is...

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000
The Move is...
