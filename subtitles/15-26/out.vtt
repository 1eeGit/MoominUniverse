00:00.000 --> 00:02.500
Oh, what exactly is it you're observing?

00:02.500 --> 00:05.500
I'm sure I saw a beautiful crayfish in there.

00:05.500 --> 00:09.500
Crayfish? Excuse me, young man, but that is zoology.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.500
Quite the most uninteresting field.

00:12.500 --> 00:14.500
There it is.

00:42.500 --> 00:49.500
Oh! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:13.500 --> 01:19.500
I got him! I got him!

01:19.500 --> 01:24.500
I got him!

01:36.500 --> 01:38.500
A dragon?

01:42.500 --> 01:49.500
Papa!

01:49.500 --> 01:53.500
Oh, what have you got there?

01:53.500 --> 01:55.500
Oh, oh, nothing, Papa.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.500
Everything's so fresh after the rain.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.500
Oh, woman.

01:59.500 --> 02:03.500
Yes, it is.

02:03.500 --> 02:07.000
I've got to show this to Snuffkin before anybody else sees it.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.500
Boom, moment!

02:28.500 --> 02:30.500
What have you got there, Moomin?

02:30.500 --> 02:33.000
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all, little lie.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
Oh, yes, you have, I saw it. Don't lie to me.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
It's just one of Mom's old jars.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Liar, liar, I know there's something.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I don't think there's nothing.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Then why are you hiding it?

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Oh, right, little mice. See me, it's not fair.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Dragon.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Ah, yeah, I was right.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
They must be a baby dragon.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Probably the very last one on Earth and washed up by the rain.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
A dragon of my own.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Well, that's wonderful.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Oh, I hope I didn't frighten you.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
I know what I'll do.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I know what I'll do.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
I know what I'll do.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I know what I'll do.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I know what I'll do.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I know what I'll do.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
I'll take the lid off the jar so you can get some fresh air, little dragon.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
See? That better, isn't it?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Come on, little fella.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
We'll give you a car to make you feel better.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Ow!

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Oh, that burnt me!

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
What a fierce little dragon you are.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Don't worry.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
I'll look after you.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I'll take good care of you.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
And when you're bigger and start to like me, I'll take you swimming in the sea.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
You must be starving.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
I'll get you something from my nighttime emergency food box.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I've got lots of things in there.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
It's bound to be something you like.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
The one.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Take anything you want.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Oh.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
Gosh, that's really clever, little dragon.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Move it. Lunch is ready.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Gummy!

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Now you stay here.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Don't worry. I'll be back in no time at all.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Remember, you're my own little dragon.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Where's sniff?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I thought he was here as well.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
He's collecting worms for fishing.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
He'll be here soon.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
We'll start without him then.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
You know, Mama, certain people keep secrets in glass jars.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Secrets?

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Oh, yes, a little secret that hisses.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
Moment, Mama, I found this near the big puddle.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Thank you, sniff.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Moment, I told you I wanted it back.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
It's my very best one.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Sorry, Mama.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I was so excited.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I must have left it when I found...

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I mean, when I was...

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
And I'm sure you know who I mean by certain people.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Did you catch anything with the sieve, Moment?

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
Yes, he did. Something that's now hidden in his room.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Big mouth.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
If it's a secret, little my.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Perhaps he doesn't want to tell anyone.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah, probably because his new pet bites.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Well, it hasn't bitten you yet, hasn't it?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
If it did, I'd bite it back.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Is it true? Does your secret really bite people?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Well, it couldn't bite very hard.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
If it was small enough to go in a jar, could it, Papa?

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
I suppose certain people might keep other small things in jars,

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
beetles and spiders, mosquitoes, scorpions, or poisonous centipedes,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
horrible things that multiply and multiply every week

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
and grow and grow until the jars are too small.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
See? Like that.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
And there'll be so many of them, thousands and thousands

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
and they'll take over moving valley and eat us all.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Oh, well, I haven't got a centipede.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Hmm, I wonder if centipedes come from outer space.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
But this is the earth deer.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
The rain could have brought them down from space, Mama, couldn't it?

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Well, you could be right. It was raining very hard yesterday.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
And it wasn't like ordinary rain.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
I saw a puddle as big as a lake.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
What's the matter, movement?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
It isn't a centipede.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Ha, we're on the right track, though.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Well, I'm glad it's not a poisonous centipede.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I shouldn't have liked that.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Oh, you're asleep.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Moomin's little dragon.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Is it okay if I go see snuffkin, Mama?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Have you finished already?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yes, I have.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Tell them they mustn't go into my room.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Or they'll have to take the consequence, sis.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
All right, Moomin, I'll make sure no one goes in there.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I promise.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Oh, but he's gonna tell snuffkin' this secret.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I should think he is.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
Best friends always come first, little my.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Hey, snuffkin.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Hi.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Fishing again?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Yep.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
The cards told me that if I caught five menos, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
South?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
You're joking.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Not at all. I believe in the cards.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
But snuffkin, winter's not here yet.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
I know that, but the cards tell you things for a reason, Moomin.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Oh, do they really?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
But it would be awfully few when you waste snuffkin.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Just awful.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I mean, I'd be very lonely.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Well, anyway, who would I talk to or tell my secrets to?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Oh, snuffkin, quickly.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You must come back to Moomin house.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Now?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Well, I suppose I could fish later.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
No, no. There's no point.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
But I have to catch five menos.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Oh.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
The fish won't bite after all is rain.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
You'd catch nothing.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
It'll be better to wait until it stops flowing so fast.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Well, perhaps you're right.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
So what's this big secret all about?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Hey, Moomin.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
Have you ever seen a dragon snuffkin?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
No, of course not.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
They all disappeared off the face of the earth many hundreds of years ago.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
But perhaps they didn't all disappear.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
What if there was one alive somewhere?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
That's impossible.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
It could be so small that it would go in a glass jar snuffkin.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Are you sure you're not daydreaming, Moomin?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
But still, anything is possible, I suppose.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
But you know me.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
I have to see it right in front of me before I believe it.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Oh, where is it?

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Mama promised me that she wouldn't let anyone in.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I'd not hear either.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Well, you were right, Moomin.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
What?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Ah, there he is.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I think you've found a real dragon.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
How do you get up there?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
He mustn't fall.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
He might lose his tail.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Don't move, little dragon.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And snuffkin, keep quiet.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
You might get frightened and do something silly.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Don't worry, I'll soon have you down.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
This will do. I'll lay it on the floor here.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Jump, little dragon.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Don't be afraid.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Come on, hold onto this and we'll bring you down slowly.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Don't panic.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I don't think it's a very good idea, Moomin.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
You'll only scare him away.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Why don't you just leave him alone?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
He'll come down when he's ready.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Dragons aren't helpless, you know, even little baby ones.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
But he's so small.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Come to Moomin.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Come on, don't you understand?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Hold onto that and I'll listen to you.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Ah!

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Ah!

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Ah!

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Ah!

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Ah!

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Look at him!

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
My dragon, come fly!

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
He's flying!

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
He's flying!

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Come down, little dragon.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
You might question or something.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Come down!

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Oh!

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Be careful, snuffkin.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
He might bite!

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
I don't think so.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
He's a very unusual pet.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
I think he likes you more than me.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Ah!

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
What a charming little creature, Moomin.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
He's lovely.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
What's his name?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
He's called Little Dragon.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Ha!

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
I don't think he's lovely at all.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Small but savage, if you ask my opinion.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
That sounds just like you, little mind.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
You think so?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Ow!

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah!

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
No, oh, oh, oh.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Oh!

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Now look here.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Ah!

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
He seems to have a thing about ears, doesn't he?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Step snuffkins, why doesn't he bite him?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Go on, dragon.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Go on, baby!

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
He's really tasty!

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Go on!

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Good news, I think he's trying to heat up snuffkins coffee.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
He must really like him.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Cleve a little thing.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Well, I hope he's careful with that hot breath.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
We don't want to start a fire.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
All right, that's enough.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
He might be useful.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
When he's bigger, we can put him in the cellar

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
and he'll be able to keep the whole house just like a furnace.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
No, we will not.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Go away!

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
You passed!

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Ow!

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
And you!

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
He only thought you were trying to get his fly.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
I'll get him if he bites me again.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Just you watch me do it.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Come on, little dragon.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
I'm sure that'll keep him quiet.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
I'd better go.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Thanks for the coffee, Mumma.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Oh no, it'll suffocate him.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
He only seems to like snuffkin.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Well, we all like snuffkin.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Stupid old dragon.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
No, he isn't.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Mum and dear, why don't you take him to your room?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
He'll be happier there.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
This will be best for him.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Oh, I wonder if he'll come back to visit us.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Why did you do that?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
He was cute and we could have always worn earmuffs.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
You can visit him in snuffkin's tent.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
I expect little dragons already sitting on his shoulder.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
It doesn't matter anyway.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Snuffkin's going south soup.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
They'll be able to go together.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Oh, my dear, Mumma.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Never mind.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Well, you're a bit of a problem.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I don't want you here, little dragon.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Come on, go away.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Go to Mumma.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Don't do that.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Oh, come on, please go to Mumma.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Look, you're very nice and it'll be fun to have you along.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
But there's Mumma.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
And he'd know you were here and you'd be upset.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Oh, there's another one.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
That's the fifth.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Oh, dear.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Hmm?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Any luck?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Not bad.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Are you going far?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Oh, I'm fair away.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Would you like some fresh fish?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I'm sure you'll get hungry.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah, what do you want in return?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
A small favor.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Take this as far as you can, open the lid and just leave it.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
What? Just leave it?

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
Yes, in a nice quiet place, with lots and lots of flies.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Flies? What's in there?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
A dragon.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
A dragon? Does it bite?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Well, it might.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
This is a big favor.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I don't even like minnows.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Oh, they're not too bad.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
If you roast them, keep the lid on.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
But make sure you open it up later so it can catch the flies.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
All right, as long as it doesn't try to bite me.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Don't worry, it won't.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Hello.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Hi.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Oh, oh, oh.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Where is he?

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Who is that?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
My dragon.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
He must have come here, snuffkin.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Oh, really?

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
I thought he was home with you, sleeping in your room.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
No, I let him out.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Ah, well, dragons are very fickle.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
All they really care about is big fat flies.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
It's best to forget about a movement.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Did you catch your five minnows?

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
No, you were right. The water is too fast.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Oh, really?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
So I won't go south until winter comes.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
You'll stay here then?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Well, I'm sure it wouldn't do to go against the cards.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Now what a movement, my friend.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Oh, that's great. You're staying snuffkin.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Fantastic. That's really, really good.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Ah, perhaps I shouldn't have painted the float bright red.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
It might have scared those little minnows right away.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Okay, let's go.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Yeah.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
That dragon was sort of stupid.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Baby dragons are.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
They make the world's worst pets.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
They never want to settle in one place.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Yeah, you're right.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
It was very funny, though, when it bit little mice here.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
I think it gave her a taste of her own medicine.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
The movement was very happy that snuffkin was staying in movement valley

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
and not going south until winter.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
And as for the dragon, well, who wants to be loved by a silly old dragon?

18:21.000 --> 18:28.000
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

18:28.000 --> 18:35.000
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
They're always happy and always at play.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
The movements.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
The movements.

18:50.000 --> 18:57.000
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

18:57.000 --> 19:04.000
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
They're always happy and always at play.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
The movements.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
The movements.

19:20.000 --> 19:26.000
The movements.

19:26.000 --> 19:48.000
Here they are for one and all.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
The movements are about to come.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
Here for you on your TV, they are the movements.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
They are the movements.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
So come with me, give me your hand.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
I'll take you up to a moment land.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
You can fly just like a bird.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Sing that song ever.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
There were the movements.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
There were the movements.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
There were the movements.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
There were the movements.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
There was the movements.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
There were the movements.

20:49.000 --> 21:19.000
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

21:19.000 --> 21:49.000
The weather was far too beautiful for Moomin Papa to concentrate on writing his memoirs, so he went for a walk instead. Good morning, Mr. Hamilton. Ah, Moomin Papa. Have you found a new plan or something? I'm afraid not, and I think I must have examined every single plan in Moomin Valley. I know what you mean. There isn't a single person living here that I don't know. Ah, yes, yes, quite. Look, why don't you come over and have a conversation?

21:49.000 --> 22:18.000
The top of tea, Mr. Hamilton. Hmm? Isn't that Moomin and Little My? Yes, I think it is. Really, Moomin Papa, peeping into people's homes. Oh, it's an empty house, Mr. Hamilton.

22:18.000 --> 22:48.000
Moomin, what are you looking at? Oh, hello, Papa. Nobody's lived in there for years. Somebody's just moved in. Oh, really? Let me have a look. Oh, goodness. How tidy they are. Perhaps the children will play with us. Oh, they might, but they seem a bit too well behaved for that. I must have a closer look at them. Me too, Moomin Papa, but the trouble is they never come outside the fence. Well, in that case, we'll have to go in.

22:48.000 --> 23:18.000
How do we do that, Papa? We can't just walk in there. See, you want to borrow some sugar? That should do it. Oh, Mr. Hamilton, where's your imagination? Will you please lend me your magnifying glass? But surely. Here it is. Oh, that should do it. What are you going to do, Papa? Now then, you all stay out here. My plan will only work.

23:18.000 --> 23:40.000
Look, if it looks as though I'm on my own. Oh, but what is your plan, Papa? I hope Papa knows what he's doing. They don't look that friendly to me. Me neither.

23:48.000 --> 24:04.000
Mama, there's someone coming. Oh, what do you want, my good man? Come on, tell me quickly. Do you hear me? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't think anyone lived here.

24:04.000 --> 24:14.000
Well, we do know you know we just moved in. Really? Oh, do forgive me, Madam. I certainly didn't mean to trespass. Ah, so what are you doing here in the garden, man?

24:14.000 --> 24:30.000
I'm researching the travel system of ants. I didn't know they had one. Oh, yeah, yeah, it's fascinating. How they find their way and build their roads, and they're not here now, of course. But this is their main road. It's very quiet at the moment, but at busy times, it's packed.

24:30.000 --> 24:42.000
I'm afraid I can't see any main road. Oh, you would if you were an expert. Anyway, I'll point it out to you next time they're on the move if I'm in the vicinity, of course. But it's worth looking out for.

24:42.000 --> 24:50.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley. I'm your next door neighbor, although we live quite a long way away. I'm Moomin. Ah, so you must be Moomin Papa, aren't you?

24:50.000 --> 24:59.000
Ah, yes, that's me. How did you know? Did someone mention my name to you?

24:59.000 --> 25:10.000
We were told the movements were a bit unusual. Very nice, they said, though. How very flattering. Thank you. And you're Mrs.

25:10.000 --> 25:24.000
Philly Junk, mother and housewife. Well, it's an honor to meet you. Mrs. Philly Junk. Well done, Papa. It looks like you found us some new friends to play with. Oh, welcome party.

25:24.000 --> 25:32.000
Don't you think it's a good idea? We haven't had a party for ages, Mama. But you hardly know them, and I've never even met them.

25:32.000 --> 25:38.000
But Mama, how can we show them that they're really welcome and they could meet everyone at a party, couldn't they?

25:38.000 --> 25:49.000
And I could take care of all the children. I know just what to do. Splendid, Moomin. Ah, Mr. Heaven, I know Moomin Papa. You'd like me to do the fireworks.

25:49.000 --> 26:01.000
It looks like we're throwing a party. We'll have lots of pretty flowers. Just tell me what you want, Mama, and we'll do it.

26:01.000 --> 26:21.000
It's great. Those kids will just love it. If they survive, Moomin.

26:21.000 --> 26:41.000
Now then, children, the Moomin's are all a little bit odd, so behead properly. Yes, mother, we will. They'll be here soon. Take this in, Moomin.

26:41.000 --> 26:53.000
Okay. The shoot works really well. Oh, good. I must try it. These look nice. Oh, stiff. Leave them alone, will you?

26:53.000 --> 27:04.000
Oh, all right. Just this one. They're here. Come on, everybody. They'll soon be at the door.

27:04.000 --> 27:23.000
Right. Come on, children. Help me with the flowers. Oh, dear. Fireworks now are later on. Oh, later on. I think you'll very hold finally.

27:23.000 --> 27:39.000
Welcome to Moomin House, Mrs. Fitzgerald. It was very kind of you to invite us, Moomin, Mama. Come in, please, and make yourselves at home. Oh, thank you all very much indeed.

27:39.000 --> 27:50.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley. All in my hair. It looks very untidy. Doesn't it, mother?

27:50.000 --> 28:02.000
It's a surprise. They should have been rose buds, but we couldn't find any at all. Oh, yes. Dear, what a mess. Mrs. Philly chunk, let me introduce the children.

28:02.000 --> 28:18.000
They all look different. Well, yes. Only Moomin is really ours. The others are sort of, I'm sure they'll all get on. Oh, I'm afraid my children do not play. They would much rather read or study.

28:18.000 --> 28:39.000
Oh, are you sure they've got to have some time for play? I'm sure. Well, come into the dining room anyway. You can watch the others play. Make sure the chairs are clean. Yes, mother, we will.

28:39.000 --> 28:53.000
Won't you let them play at all? No, I will not. Come on, everybody. Wouldn't you like to have a go on our slide? No.

28:53.000 --> 29:03.000
Hmm. You'd really enjoy it once you got going. I know you would. No, thank you. No, no, not at all. No, definitely not.

29:03.000 --> 29:15.000
And you're really quite sure, are you? Yes. I thought so. Then we've got it all to ourselves.

29:15.000 --> 29:27.000
Moomin sounds like he's having fun.

29:27.000 --> 29:47.000
Oh, and that's little May and sniff. Your children seem very quiet, Mrs. Billy Junk. Good children are seen and not heard right here.

29:47.000 --> 29:59.000
That was one of mine. And that was another. Well, it sounds like they're having fun for once.

29:59.000 --> 30:05.000
To have a biscuit, Mrs. Billy Junk. They have an unusual taste. I'd run out of flowers, so I used them.

30:05.000 --> 30:17.000
Oh, don't worry, move them and look after them. Go on, it's your turn now.

30:17.000 --> 30:35.000
My children. Stop it, it's too dangerous. You might hurt yourself.

30:35.000 --> 30:47.000
Oh, come on, stop it at once. Now, don't you worry, Mrs. Billy Junk. I've got ointment in my bag if they hurt themselves.

30:47.000 --> 30:55.000
But you'll hear mother.

30:55.000 --> 31:01.000
Stop children, you hear me. We're going home now. Stop it.

31:01.000 --> 31:13.000
I think it's time for the glorious finale, Papa.

31:13.000 --> 31:27.000
I can't say I wasn't warned. Exposing them to this, Moomin Valley is no place for proper children. No place at all. Oh, dear, what's this?

31:27.000 --> 31:37.000
There are fireworks in your honor. Fireworks. I made them especially to welcome you.

31:47.000 --> 31:53.000
Goodbye, come back soon. Maybe tomorrow. No, you will not.

31:53.000 --> 32:01.000
I don't think Mrs. Billy Junk enjoyed her party. She's very lucky that I didn't bite her.

32:01.000 --> 32:07.000
She should have had a go on the slide. I'm sure she would have loved it, and then she wouldn't have shouted at her children.

32:07.000 --> 32:13.000
Don't, don't slide down, shoot, sniff. They're too afraid of looking silly.

32:13.000 --> 32:22.000
Oh, oh, Papa. Oh, I'm very sorry, Moomin, but don't worry, I'll fix it. It is nothing much broken.

32:22.000 --> 32:30.000
What happened, my dear? Well, I thought it had been such a long time since I'd been on the slide that I'd have a go.

32:30.000 --> 32:40.000
I didn't think I'd be too heavy for it. I know. When we mend it, why don't we make it strong enough for me and Mama to play on as well? I think she'd like that.

32:40.000 --> 32:45.000
That's a good idea, Papa, but we want to use it too.

32:45.000 --> 32:50.000
And that's a cool idea. I just try it out, now and again.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
I want you to stay here while I'm out. What if somebody asks us to play?

33:02.000 --> 33:09.000
What do you mean? Play. I hope you're not thinking of the Moomins, are you?

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
I don't want you mixing with those noisy children ever again. Do you hear me?

33:14.000 --> 33:21.000
Where are you going, mother? To look for another house. It was a terrible mistake coming to Moomin Valley.

33:31.000 --> 33:37.000
Look, there's Mrs. Philly drunk. Good afternoon. Please stay away from my children.

33:37.000 --> 33:43.000
Oh, but why? We thought they might like to come and have an adventure with us.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
Oh, never mind. Let's go.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
Hey, hang on a minute.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
Oh, you're Tarsam.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
I can't see. It's too late for you now, snap.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
Oh, no, not the hungry crocodile at the bottom of the courtyard.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
We should have brought the Philly Junks with us. But Moomin missed his Philly Junks.

34:36.000 --> 34:42.000
We need looked older. Have you been killed and eaten yet, Sniff?

34:42.000 --> 34:48.000
No, I fell on top of the crocodile and knocked him out and then swam.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
Sniff, but I thought you couldn't swim.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
On your own business.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
Hey, that looks like the Philly Junks.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Why don't they come over here?

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
I bet their mother told them not to talk to us. See if I care you.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
Hey, what are you doing? Why aren't you playing with Moomin and the others?

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
I don't think they want to play with us.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
They didn't call for us when they went past.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
Stinky's arrived and wonder what he's doing here.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
I bet you it's no fun stuck in that garden.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
No, we'd rather be out here playing.

35:38.000 --> 35:43.000
Well, I know somewhere much better than Moomin's. It's a great place to play.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Do you?

35:44.000 --> 35:50.000
Yes, would I lie to you? It's a bit of a way off, but it'll be really exciting and lots of fun so do you want to come or not.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Well, it is a bit boring here.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Yes, very.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
Oh, do you really think they don't want to play with us? Doesn't it look like it?

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
Your brother's absolutely right, so come on if you're coming because I can't wait.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
What stinky up to? I don't trust him.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
Okay, now this is the place I told you about. Good, isn't it?

36:26.000 --> 36:31.000
Now, if you hang on to that rope, you can swing over to the other side and back again.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
Don't worry, it's quite safe.

36:34.000 --> 36:39.000
That's great. I've never been anywhere like this.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
A bit frightening.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
Without the thrill, where's the fun?

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
You need a bit of danger to spice it up.

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
Gee, Willikers, it looks like the other side is higher than this side.

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
Yes, I bet. It's all right. You just have to put your legs up, that's all.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Who wants to go first?

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
I've got it. Why don't you all go together?

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
What? The three of us?

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
See, this way you won't feel so scared, will you?

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
No, not together.

37:08.000 --> 37:15.000
Well, why don't you go one at a time then? That way it's always more fun.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Can you do it, Stinky?

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
Don't be silly. Of course I can. I do it all at a time. One of the things I'm best at.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Even if I do say so myself.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
So, why don't you show us, Stinky?

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Move him!

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
I didn't know you were such a rope, Stinky. I'm sure he didn't either.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
So, this is your usual place, isn't it?

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Well, sort of.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
You know something. If you hadn't said that you'd done this lots of times,

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
I wouldn't have believed that I could have done it myself.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
Come on, Stinky. Show us how you do it.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
If you go first, I'll be second.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
No, it's all right. You can go first, Mom.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
But I want to see how it's done. Then throw me the rope and I'll follow.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
Now, tell the truth. You've never done it. Have you, Stinky?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Of course I've done it, stupid.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
Now, come on. Come on. Don't be such a spoiled sport.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
We're all here waiting to cheer you on.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
All right, everybody. I give you the brave, involved Tarzan, Stinky.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Are you watching?

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Are you ready, Stinky?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
A big cheer, everyone.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Ready?

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
Oh, Stinky, my big brave here. Oh, jump!

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
Well, go on. We're all waiting for you, Stinky.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
Come on, Stinky. Show us how it's done.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Come on, Stinky.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
Yeah!

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
Oh, so this is how you've done it lots of times before, is it?

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
Yes, the rope must have shrunk.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
He was trying to fool you. It was a dangerous game.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
And he knew very well it couldn't be done.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
I didn't.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
Now, why don't you come with us and play properly?

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
You're gonna be Tarzan as long as you like.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
And when you get tired, just let go of the rope. All right, Stinky?

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Come on, Stinky.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
You can't just leave me.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
You're a fox.

39:25.000 --> 39:32.000
And isn't fair, please help. Don't leave me here.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
Yeah!

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
But Stinky was left on his own to decide whether to climb up the rope or drop into the river.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
And the filajong children had more fun than they'd ever had before.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
But they didn't get home until very late in the evening.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Bye, we'll see you tomorrow.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Okay, mommy.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Bye, Momen.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Bye-bye.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
Oh, my dear children, I told you to stay at home.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
What earth have you been? Where have you been?

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
With movement of the others.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
They kidnapped you, did they?

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
No, we've been playing with them.

40:16.000 --> 40:21.000
Well, you can just forget about the movements we're moving out as soon as we possibly can.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Moving, mother?

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Yes, right away from this valley.

40:25.000 --> 40:29.000
This is no place for a spotless and well-ordered home.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
What's the matter?

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
No, we don't want to move.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
We want to stay, mother.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Movement house is nice and dusty.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
We want to stay in the movement valley forever.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Oh, please, mother, we love it here.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
Oh, after all I've done for you children.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
And my experience children usually get what they want.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
It was for me.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
I was for me.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
I'm for you, I'm for you.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
My dear ones.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
I'm for you.

41:25.000 --> 41:30.000
And that was how Phila Junk and her three children got married.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
And that was how Phila Junk and her three children got married.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
John and her three children became permanent residents of

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
Mumen Valley.

41:40.000 --> 41:47.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

41:47.000 --> 41:54.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
They're always happy and always at play.

41:58.000 --> 42:05.000
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
The movements.

42:09.000 --> 42:16.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

42:16.000 --> 42:23.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
They're always happy and always at play.

42:27.000 --> 42:34.000
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
The movements.

42:38.000 --> 42:44.000
The movements.

42:53.000 --> 43:06.000
Here they are for one and all.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
The movements are about to come.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
They're here for you on your TV.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
They are the movements.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
They are the movements.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
So come with me, give me your hand.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
I'll take you up to Mumenland.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
You can fly just like a bird.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Sing that song ever.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
There were the movements.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
There were the movements.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
There were the movements.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
There were the movements.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
There were the movements.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
There were the movements.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
There were the movements.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
There were the movements.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
There were the movements.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
There were the movements.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
There were the movements.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
There were the movements.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
There were the movements.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
There were the movements.

44:15.000 --> 44:21.000
There were the movements.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
There were the movements.

44:25.000 --> 44:33.000
There were the movements.

44:33.000 --> 44:39.000
For a whole week, snorkew maiden had been curled up on the sofa, reading fairy tales.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
It's a lovely day.

44:41.000 --> 44:50.000
Last Mumen has persuaded her to come out for a walk in the lonely mountains.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Oh, it's beautiful up here.

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
Aren't you glad you came now?

44:56.000 --> 45:01.000
This is much better than fairy tales, isn't it snorkew maiden?

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Oh, look, Mumen.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
It's Adelweis.

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
Adelweis?

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
No, it isn't.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
That doesn't grow here at all.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
I'm sure it is.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
I know what it looks like.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
I'm sorry, but it's not.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
Oh, it's just like in Heidi.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
No, it's not.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
It's just a Daisy.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Oh, come on.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
I want to pick it.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Oh, no, it's too dangerous.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
I know then.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
You can do it.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
You're my boyfriend, aren't you, Mumen?

45:33.000 --> 45:37.000
Well, I suppose we could climb down there, but I promise you it's not Adelweis.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
That only grows in the Alps and there are hundreds of miles away.

45:41.000 --> 45:48.000
I know it's Adelweis.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Be careful.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
They don't care about danger in fairy tales.

45:52.000 --> 46:00.000
That's why they call them fairy tales, silly.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
Fair Princess, please accept this, my humble offering.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
Thank you, Brave Knight.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
You were right, Mumen.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
This isn't Adelweis.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
See, I told you.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
It's going to be hard to get down from here, you know?

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Can't we go back the way we came?

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
Well, I think it'll be easier to try to get to that path.

46:19.000 --> 46:24.000
If you say so.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
It's nearer anyway.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
And better than going up.

46:28.000 --> 46:33.000
I'm surprised you're such a good climber.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
Oh, Royalty is good at practically everything.

46:37.000 --> 46:43.000
It's not made of.

46:43.000 --> 46:50.000
It's not made of.

46:50.000 --> 46:57.000
It's not made of.

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
It's not made of.

47:02.000 --> 47:09.000
Let me see six pebbles.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
What was that?

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
A giant snowball?

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
It can't be.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
It isn't winter.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Oh, well, nothing of interest to me.

47:16.000 --> 47:21.000
Now, where was I?

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
We start handling.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Has snort maiden just gone past you?

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
Snort maiden.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
No, all I've seen going past is a very large snowball.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
That was snort maiden.

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
But she's not made of snow.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
Stop!

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Snort maiden!

47:37.000 --> 47:44.000
Stop!

47:44.000 --> 47:54.000
Snort maiden.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Snort maiden.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Snort maiden.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Oh, praise the booble.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
She's still breathing.

47:59.000 --> 48:09.000
She's just knocked her so out.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Oh, Mum and what's happened to her?

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
She's unconscious.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
Oh, what are you trying to do?

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
I want to get her home to Mama.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
Oh, difficult.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
She should lose a bit of weight.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
Perhaps she'd come around if we splashed cold water in her face.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
Oh, there's nothing to fetch it in.

48:29.000 --> 48:35.000
Ah, if you cut some bark off a tree trunk, you could make a small container.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
What a good idea.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
If you stay here, I'll go and do that.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
Wake up, snort maiden.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Oh, that's cold.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Has she come around yet, Mr. Himulet?

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
No.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Okay.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
Oh, good.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
It's working.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
How are you feeling, snort maiden?

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
Are you alright, snort maiden?

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Where am I?

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
We're still up in Lonely Mountains.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
Who am I?

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
Why Royal Highness the Princess of Lonely Mountains?

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
What?

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
A Princess?

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
Oh, yes.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Of course.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
And who are you?

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I am the Prince of Lonely Mountains.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Oh, yeah.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
Oh, yeah.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
With that ridiculous shape?

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
Ha.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
No.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
A gesture, perhaps.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
You want?

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
You there.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Do not laugh.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
I think the poor girl must have lost her memory.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
Of course not.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
She's just pretending.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
When does not whisper with royalty present.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Do you hear?

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
So sorry, Royal Highness.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
A poor crafters cabin.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
This is your castle, ma'am.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Royalty doesn't live in shacks.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Snort maiden.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Stop calling us that.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
It's very rude.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Oh, forgive me.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Our royal castle is elsewhere.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
Is it not?

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
What?

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
That must be hunting lodge.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
No, of course.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
That's what it is.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
Good.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
We accept that.

50:51.000 --> 50:58.000
Are you two going to tell me what you're so busy looking at?

50:58.000 --> 51:07.000
Send a maid to my room, my good man.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
A maid.

51:10.000 --> 51:17.000
My good man.

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
Papa, have you seen Snort maiden?

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Yes, up there.

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
Mama, please would you go on have a word with Snort maiden?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Have you been quarreling?

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Oh, no.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
It's just that she fell and banged her head,

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
and now she thinks she's a royal princess.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
What?

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
Ah, Nanette, come here, please.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
Nanette, I'm Boomin, Mama.

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
Oh, we're too wary for your foolish jokes, girl.

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
Oh, we are very tired indeed, Nanette.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Please bring our silk nightie

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
with the hand embroidered swans and clowns.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Then you may go.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
I wish you, Mama.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
All right, I'm sure.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
But she seems convinced she's a princess.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Sounds as if it's dangerous, doesn't it, Mama?

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Oh, I don't think so.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
I was only joking when I called her a princess.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
I'm very glad you didn't call her an opera singer.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
It's Snort maiden asleep now?

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Oh, yes.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
In a night gown with crowns and swans embroidered on it.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
And another thing, Boomin, she wants a canopy put up immediately.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
What's that?

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
Oh, a fancy cover over the bed that's draped in silks,

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
silvers and tassels.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
Oh.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
She was very upset because there wasn't one there already.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
It might be necessary.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
Her memory could have come back by the time she wakes up.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
Why don't we wait and see?

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
She might be fine after a rest.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I sure hope so.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
But what do we do if it hasn't come back?

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Let's think about that if it happens.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
We might not have to build that canopy.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Let me try it.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
John, what?

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
To get Snort maiden's memory back, what else?

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
Oh, how?

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
Well, I think that if she sees me, she'll remember me

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
and then she'll remember everything else, too.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Don't be silly little mind.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
If she doesn't remember me, why should you remember you, eh?

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
Simple, because I'm unforgettable.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
There is that, I suppose.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
She's still fast asleep.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Well, I'm glad we made the canopy anyway.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
It looks really great, doesn't it?

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
Oh, look, she's opening her eyes.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Are you awake?

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Get up, Snort maiden.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
Come on.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
Let's go down to the beach.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
And who is that person?

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Come on, you remember me.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
I warn you with you, though you'll be sorry.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Oh, quite amusing.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Ah, so you remember me now?

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
Of course we do.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
There you are, I told you.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Who am I then?

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Well, you're another court jester.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Of course.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Don't be little lie.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Court jester.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Oh, very funny.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
She's a better clown than the other one.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
You can perform at our wedding.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
You're a wedding.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Hmm.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, why?

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
Hi, stinky.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
What are you doing here?

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Moments asked me to come over to Moments House

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
and propose to some princess.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
Moments lost his marbles as well then.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
I think he wanted Stinky as a contrast.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
You what?

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
You mean to tell me you're both my rivals for the hands of the royal princess?

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
Well, it's not very original, but in order to win the princess,

55:09.000 --> 55:13.000
and have her kingdom, Stinky, you'll need to solve three riddles.

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
Hey, that's great! What's this kingdom like?

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
All right, sooner number one, you may now enter.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Oh, that's me.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Oh!

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
Oh, hi, princess! How are you doing?

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
Jester, is this man a suitor?

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
He is.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
I fear he does not treat us with respect.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Forgive him, your highness.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
He is from a foreign land.

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
And does not know the ways of your kingdom.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Hmm.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Well, all right, very well.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Here is the first riddle. Are you ready?

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Are you awake?

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Now then, listen, what is it that is yellow?

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Has four legs and sings?

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Oh, dear. And unusual, canary?

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
With four legs, you nincomboop.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
I don't know any birds with four legs.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Who said it was a bird?

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Oh, I don't know.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
I don't know.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
I don't know.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
I don't know.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
I don't know.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
I don't know.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
I don't know.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Who said it was a bird?

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
All right, then. What's the answer, snark baby?

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
He shows no respect.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
Throw him into a dungeon and give him no food.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
You're highness.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
He is temporarily out of his mind after the long journey here.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Hang on. I'm not out of my mind.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
God, up she is.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
How so what's the answer? That's what I want to know.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
Silence. It does not concern you.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
We believe you to be of lowly birth.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Sorry about this, napkin.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
Don't worry.

56:51.000 --> 56:54.000
Hmm, no, sir Gellad, but not bad.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
I am honored to be here, your royal highness.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
He'll do.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
An easy riddle to start.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
Here it is.

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
First, what is the number of which we think?

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
Take your time.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
Two?

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
For a faux-galat night, that is correct.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
Now listen, what is the word upon our mind?

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
Love.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
That's amazing.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
Truly, the suitor has brains as well as looks.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
Question three.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
There are two numbers on our mind.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
What do they add up to?

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Answer carefully for it.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Could unlock your princess's heart.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Twenty-one.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
Oh, was that right, too?

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
Oh no, it was twenty-two.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
My heart is heavy.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
For chance we should have said it was correct.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
He was rather cute.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Was he not just her?

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
It's your turn now, stinky.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
Well, I suppose that even half of Snort Toss would be something.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Think she'll ever get her memory back?

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Of course she will.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
This is not our idea of a suitor.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
His heart is aching for you, your royal highness.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Ah, let it ache.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
Oh, alright.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
I'll give him a chance.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Here is a question number one.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
What is the number we are thinking of?

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
Well, of all our stupid questions.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
We haven't all day.

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
Oh, well, four.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Indeed not.

58:24.000 --> 58:28.000
It is three million five hundred ninety-eight thousand seven hundred and sixty-five.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Be gone out.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Hey, Snort Toss, that's not fair.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
What fruit is up with his hands?

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
It's not fair, right?

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
It's not fair, right?

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
Go home.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Give me another one I want after.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Oh, what a rude suitor.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
We are no longer in the mood for royal marriage, Jester.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
At least not today.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
A wise decision.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
A princess of the lonely mountains.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
They will be prostrated with grief,

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
but bid the other suitors to go home.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Do not let them beg.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
We would not like that.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Very well, your royal highness.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
Do it kindly.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
We wish them no pain at all.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
From this day on, we shall devote ourselves to good works

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
and to the well-being of our people.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Oh.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
You know, I didn't want to marry you anyway.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Wonder what Snort Maiden's up to now?

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Upstairs thinking.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
She says she'll devote her life to good works.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Work? What works?

59:21.000 --> 59:25.000
I don't know, but she probably wants to be remembered in the history books.

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
The princess who was adored by her subjects.

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
Oh, she's coming down.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Your royal highness.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
May I assist you?

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Send the net to us.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
She is on an errand, your highness.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
Then have someone else make soup, nourishing but not too rich.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Soup, highness?

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
Yes indeed.

59:49.000 --> 59:53.000
And then we shall take it to our poor subjects ourselves.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
What kind of soup?

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
We don't know.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
We eat.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
We don't cook.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
The poor will be happy with anything brought by the princess herself.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Now hurry, ma'am.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Be quick about it.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
No, she wants some soup.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
This will be ample.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
The poor do not eat much.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
It would only make the meal.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I don't know anyone poor around here, your majesty.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Nonsense.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000
One, two, one, two, one.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Greetings, jester.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
What now?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
We're taking soup to the poor.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Made with our own regal fingers.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Do you know where they are, jester?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Your fingers?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Oh, I know.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Good, wonderful.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Take us to them now.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
They will be so grateful.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
You back princess.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
That house there.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Oh yes.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
It's nice to know that the poor and my kingdom are so well off.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Oh you, please come over here.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Hmm?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Will you?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I'm the princess of Lonely Mountain.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Princess?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Oh!

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
What moment you're all highness?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Do not keep us waiting.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
We have a lot to do.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I'm coming.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I'm coming.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Forgive me you're all highness.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I had no idea you were.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
My, my, smart maiden.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
That common name again.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
We are princess.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Little sticks.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
You're not right in the head.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Coming here bothering your elders and betters like this.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
My betters?

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Oh!

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Are you the queen then?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Hmm?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I am Mrs. Philly Johnk.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Now what do you want?

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
You're just fulfilling our royal duty, bringing soup to the poor.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Giving cheer to those less fortunate that ourselves.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Here my good woman.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Now if you just pour.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Oh there you call me, poor.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
You who doesn't have a stitch of clothing to your name.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Oh!

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
The rich aroma of the soup must have overcome you Mrs. Philly Johnk.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Ah!

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Eat it yourself your majesty.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Ah!

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
This is how I treason.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Send for the guard.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Take her to the tower.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Oh!

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Oh!

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
We cannot see.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I'm afraid that serves you right, snork maiden.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Snork maiden!

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Don't use that common name.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Help us.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
We cannot see.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Please stand still.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Your royal highness.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Oh hold a moment.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Oh!

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Oh!

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Oh!

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I think it's stuck moment.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Use the handle.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Ah!

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Stop!

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
You're hurting me.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Right, I'll get it on.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Out of the way.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Ah!

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Wait a minute.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
You can't break that soup, Turin.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
It's a family heirloom.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
And you mustn't hit snork maiden on the head.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
You might hurt her.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Stop falling around and get this thing off will you?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
All right.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Oh!

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Of course, smart maiden.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
You didn't have to hit her that hard.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Difficult to judge it with a broom.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I've never hit anyone wearing a soup, Turin, before.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
You will write your royal highness.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Oh, forgive us, your royal highness.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Sprinkle some cold water over her face.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
No, she'd hate that, mama.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Snork maiden.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Ah, it's no good, woman.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
I don't think she'll wake up to anything but your royal highness.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Your highness.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Your highness!

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Your highness!

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Your highness!

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Snork maiden.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Oh, I'm so glad your royal highness is with us again.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I hope your royal highness is not badly hurt.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Oh...

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Where am I?

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
In moment, Valley, of course, stupid.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Where do you think?

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
That's weird.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I thought, moment, and I had gone for a walk in the lonely mountains.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Didn't we, moment?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Huh?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Do you remember who I am, Snork maiden?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Moment.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
What are you talking about, of course I do.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
And you don't think you're a princess anymore?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Princess?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Have you gone crazy or something?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
What princess?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
What do you mean, moment?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Hooray!

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
She's back to normal.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Snork maiden's back to normal.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Yes, it's nice to have you back again.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Yes, it's wonderful.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Welcome home.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
What is?

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
What's wonderful?

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Have you all gone loopy or something?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Never mind, Snork maiden.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Ha ha, you bumped your head, that's all.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
And so Snork maiden's brief spell as a royal princess came to an end.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Except that she was the only one who didn't remember it.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
But everyone else in moment Valley breathed a sigh of relief.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.000
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the romance.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
They're always happy and always at play.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
The movements.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
The movements.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:32.000
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000
They're always happy and always at play.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
The movements.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
The movements.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:01.000
The movements.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Here they are for one and all.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
The movements are about to come.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
They're for you on your TV.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
They are the movements.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
They are the movements.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
So come with me, give me your hand.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I'll take you up to a moment land.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
You can fly just like a bird.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Sing that song ever.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
There were the movements.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
There were the movements.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
There were the movements.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
There was the movements.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
There was the movements.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
There was the movements.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

01:07:37.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da dat da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:13.000
However, we do know that they don't look like this because this is Sniff, one of Moonman's friends.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:09:01.000
So it looks as though the rumor was right.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Oh, what rumor was that?

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
That we were about to be invaded by aliens from outer space.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Oh, dear, do you mean that thing that was chasing me might have been one of them?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Well, yes.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I thought they were just after me.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:24.000
I wouldn't have thought you'd have been that important to them Sniff, but I suppose you never know, do you?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:32.000
It says here in this book that aliens from outer space are very civilized and peace-loving and would never want to invade us.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
It seemed as though they're quite happy where they are.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I do, it's not a very scientific book.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Well, it was definitely attacking me, Mom and Papa, I know it was.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Well, it might have been a civilization from another planet, Sniff.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
They were just hungry.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Well, the inspector told me that he thought we were being invaded by aliens, and he shouldn't know.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I'm sure he's exaggerating.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I wonder what they look like.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Why don't you come and help me in the garden?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
You never know, we might see one.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Mama, wait for me!

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Mama, what's that?

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Well, I would say it's not a vegetable, that's for sure.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
It looks like a flying saucer.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I wonder if there are any aliens in it.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
They might be heard, Mama.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Let's have a look.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I think there's something there.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
This looks odd.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I wonder what it is.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
It's a bit like a radio, isn't it?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Oh yeah, an alien radio.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Do you think there's anyone in there moving?

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Anybody there?

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
It seems to have been deserted.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
There's a funny noise coming from it.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Well, it doesn't look to me like it could fly again.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
It could be repaired.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
You'd need to know about flying saucers.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Papa could do it?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I don't think flying saucers should make that sort of noise.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Do you, woman?

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I don't think so, but I don't know very much about them.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
It does seem a bit odd as if they've said it to be blown up

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
so that no one would be able to steal it

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
because they want to keep the design a secret.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Do you think it will?

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Oh!

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
I'm not sure, Mama, but let's get away in case it does explode.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
That's why it's empty, but I wish it hadn't landed in the Asparagus patch.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I'll take the radio with me.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
It won't be too long now, Mama.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
No, it won't.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
It won't be long, then.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
It's vanished.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Bless my soul.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Papa's book said they could be a very advanced life form.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000
There's nothing to show it was ever here,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
except the hole in the ground, and this radio thing.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Hmm.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Is it a radio, Papa?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I don't know. It looks a bit like one.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Let's try pressing one of these buttons.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
The red one first, I think.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Oh!

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Papa, where have you gone?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Well, I'm right here, Boomin.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I wonder what happens if I press this one.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't see you either, dear.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
What?

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Oh, I see.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
So if you press the red button, you'll become invisible.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
What a fascinating machine.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Papa, I think I'd rather see you, dear.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Well, of course you would.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Well, then let's try the yellow one.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I think. Can you see me now?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
No, Papa.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Oh, that's odd.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Do you want me to try, Papa?

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Please, Mama.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
There, that's it.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Oh, Papa.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Oh, that's a very dangerous machine.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I don't want to disappear ever again.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
It's not a nice experience.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
No, dear. I didn't like you vanishing like that.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
We must put it somewhere safe, Mama, where the children can't find it.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Yes, dear.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
What?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Moment!

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Snork maiden, what an earth's the matter.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
We found a strange creature.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Strange creature?

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I think it's an alien.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Does it look like a jellyfish?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
No, not at all.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Little mice keeping an eye on it. Come on!

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Where are you going, Moment, Papa?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.800
Going me, I don't know, Especial.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.240
Moving mama, hang on.

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.680
I've got a few questions for you.

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:43.920
Really, Inspector?

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:48.840
I was told that a flying saucer

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:52.520
had landed in your garden, but all I can see is a big hole.

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:53.520
Where is it?

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.280
What have you done with the saucer?

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.400
Nothing.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.560
Well, where is it?

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.440
It's not there now.

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.360
It was there, but then it just vanished.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.600
Vanished?

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.560
Yes, that's right.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:08.920
When you say vanish, do you mean it flew away again?

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:11.800
No, it just went, woof, gone.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.800
Moments are it, too.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:14.840
That's very odd.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.200
Yes, it was.

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.520
Did you see any aliens on board by any chance?

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.760
No.

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.640
Are you telling me the truth?

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.680
Of course.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.440
Why should I lie to you?

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.040
Well, I can't.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.240
Think of any reason.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.720
I'm sorry, but it's upsetting aliens

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.520
invading Moment Valley.

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:33.600
Yes, it is.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:34.880
Can we go now?

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.400
Certainly.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.920
Where are you all going, by the way?

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.880
Oh, only to the beach to collect shells.

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.480
See you, Inspector.

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:49.240
Collecting shells, indeed, while I'm hunting for aliens.

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:53.640
Ah, over here!

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.840
Ah, ah!

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.080
Ah, ah!

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.280
Ah, ah!

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.320
Do you know what I'm doing?

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.760
Ah, ah, ah!

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.240
Is that an alien?

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.000
It certainly is, but not like it says in the book.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.440
Have you tried talking to it?

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:13.280
Yes, but it wouldn't answer.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.800
Well, let me try.

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.920
Are you from outer space?

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:18.720
Go show what, Lee.

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.760
What, Lee, do I see Duckidackadale in Dublin?

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.080
Yes, Lee, do I see Duckidackadale?

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.920
I've never been.

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.720
It looks like an alien child to me.

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.000
More like a lamp.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:29.880
Poor thing.

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:31.240
He must be hungry.

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.840
Let's take him home.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:36.080
Yeah, well, we don't want the inspector to see him.

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.520
That is nothing.

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:51.840
It's not under a bottle of love.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:17:01.640
I'm sorry we can't understand you, but I'm sure you'll like milk, even if you don't

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:02.640
speak English.

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:03.840
Just try it and see.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.680
I think he's missing his home.

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.200
Wherever in the universe that might be.

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.120
I wonder where his parents are.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.560
He can't have come on his own.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.240
He seems far too little for that.

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:19.280
Well, I don't know.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:23.080
But he's obviously missing him, and he seems very unhappy.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.520
Do you think the inspector would really arrest him, Owen Papa?

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.520
Possibly.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.720
He would think it is duty.

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.200
Well, that would be horrible of him.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.200
I know.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.600
Don't touch me.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:37.720
Don't touch me.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.840
Oh, it's inspector.

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:40.440
Oh, dear.

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:44.320
He mustn't find him here.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.000
And he's got stinky with him.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
No, stinky.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.320
Well, that means trouble.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.320
Quick.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.320
He can hide in the kitchen.

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.320
We got to do something.

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.320
And quickly.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.320
I know what to do.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.320
What, Mama?

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.320
We'll use the machine.

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.320
Oh, yeah.

01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:18.720
We'll just keep him out of sight.

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:24.960
Now, then, this one, right?

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:29.960
Oh, dear.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.960
I think they're here.

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:33.480
Oh, moving Papa.

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:39.280
I heard there was an alien here with what?

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:45.280
What's happening?

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.280
What's happened to me?

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.280
Goodness, inspector.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:48.280
You're very shiny.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.280
Oh, dear.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.280
Yes.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:51.280
How very, very strange.

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:54.520
You look like a great big glow worm.

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:58.480
An inspector in shining armor, you mean, little my?

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.720
That's just what I thought.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:03.560
You will never need a lamp to be seen, inspector.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:04.560
I like it.

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.320
Criminals will be afraid of me.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:10.760
I can't wait to get back to the station and show the constables.

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.360
Handy for reading in bed, too.

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.360
Well, duty calls.

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.360
Bye.

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.520
What are you doing?

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.720
I didn't know that the machine was still working.

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.720
Oh, you can speak English.

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:31.720
Of course I can.

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:34.320
It's just that I need my language converted to help me to translate.

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.600
And if you hadn't taken it from my ship and hidden it,

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:38.760
I would have been able to talk sooner.

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.440
That's a good way to learn, isn't it?

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.440
Where are you going?

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.520
To see that nice shiny man.

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.400
But he'll arrest you.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.400
He came here looking for you, but he forgot about it

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:53.840
when the machine started him glowing.

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.000
No, don't go there.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.200
Hey, wait.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.960
I love that lint of shimmer.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:04.000
It's just like, oh, it makes me feel really safe.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.840
Hello, hello, inspector.

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.400
Yes, what is it?

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:08.840
Take me with you.

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:10.440
What?

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:13.840
Oh, you're so bright and beautiful inspector.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.600
Oh, you think so?

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.600
Hello, everyone, shimmers like that.

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:18.280
Everyone.

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:20.760
Well, that must be very nice for them.

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.760
I want to pose you, please.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:26.800
I'm sorry, I'm too busy, but it was nice talking to you.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.600
You see, the aliens have invaded Movement Valley,

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:32.200
and I must find them.

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:35.200
Oh, I just remembered.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:39.200
I was tipped off that there was one of them in Moomin House.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.200
Oh.

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:47.960
The inspector's coming back.

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.120
What about the alien?

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.680
He's running after him.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.640
Has he been handcuffed, Moomin?

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.720
I don't think so.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:03.680
Open up in the name of the law, Moomin Papa.

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:05.560
Certainly for you, inspector.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.400
Come on in.

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.840
You're very welcome.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:12.040
Moomin Papa, I have information from a reliable source

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:15.720
while sort of reliable that you have been harping

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:16.800
a fugitive.

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.640
I'm sorry.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.600
In other words, I believe you have been hiding an alien here.

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.840
Oh, inspector, I don't think hiding is the right word.

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:27.360
That suggests we are trying to keep something from you.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.760
Well, Moomin?

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.480
Would we do that, inspector?

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:37.920
That stinky is tricked me again.

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:39.800
Isn't it lucky he didn't find you?

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.040
I want a nice inspector.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.120
Look, how many times must I tell you?

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:46.040
He'll lock you up in an nasty cell.

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:46.880
I like him.

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.520
I want to see him.

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:49.520
No, don't.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:56.600
Perhaps if we press the yellow button, he'll stop shining.

01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:57.600
Good idea, Papa.

01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.600
Be quick, Mama.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:01.600
The yellow button.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.600
Here goes.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.600
You don't want him now that he stopped shining.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.600
Do you, little fella?

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.600
Let's go home, man.

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.600
Moomin, Mama, come and look.

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.600
We've saved the alien.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:33.600
Moomin, Mama, the inspector's not glowing anymore.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.600
Isn't that something?

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:36.600
Mama.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:42.600
Mama.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.600
Where are you, man?

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:45.600
I'm here.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.600
Hey, what?

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.600
Where are you, Mama?

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.600
Well, Mama.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.600
Right here.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.600
Mama.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.600
Oh, no.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:02.600
What's happened to you?

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.600
I don't know.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.600
Probably that machine again.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:08.600
Oh, so it shrinks you as well as making you invisible, does it?

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:09.600
Well, well.

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.600
Oh, dear.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.600
I need an apron.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:15.600
Papa, can you get a handkerchief from my handbag?

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:20.600
You really are quite small.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.600
That you look very cute, of course, Mama.

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.600
Would you like to stay like that for a while?

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.600
No, but I would not.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:29.600
Push another button quickly before anyone sees me.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:30.600
Go on now.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:31.600
Hurry up, Papa.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.600
Yeah.

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:34.600
Oh, dear.

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.600
What's up?

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.600
The machine's gone.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.600
Hey, you!

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.600
Taking it back!

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.600
Papa.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:48.600
Don't worry, Mama.

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.600
I'll get it back.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.600
Look, not that way.

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:02.600
Stop him, Moments.

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:03.600
Stop him.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.600
He stole the machine.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.600
We'll get him, Papa.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:10.600
Hey, Sniff.

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:11.600
Sniff.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.600
Don't let Steve keep getting away.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.600
Right.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.600
Inventory!

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.600
Please let me pass, Sniff.

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:25.600
I'll give you a gold stopper.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.600
A gold stopper?

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:27.600
I mean, free.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:28.600
No, no, five.

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:29.600
Five?

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:30.600
No.

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:32.600
Give me the machine, Stinky.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.600
Where is it, Moments?

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.600
What's happened to the machine?

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:48.600
It's at the bottom of the river, Papa.

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.600
Oh, poor Mama. Poor Mama.

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.600
What's wrong with her?

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:55.600
Well, she needs the machine to get back to normal.

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.600
Normal?

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:07.600
Well, at least this is a chance to do some really fine embroidery.

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.600
Don't worry, Mama.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.600
I promise we'll look after you.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:14.600
It's all right, Moomin.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:15.600
I'll manage.

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.600
I'll have to get some smaller pots and pans, though,

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:20.600
and we'll have to have smaller helpings.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.600
But that might be a bad idea.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:29.600
Oh.

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:43.600
Here.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:44.600
Here.

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:48.600
Mama, Papa.

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.600
It's like the one we saw in the garden.

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.600
Mama, Papa.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.600
Oh, my God.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.600
This is a very bad idea.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.600
Hey, I'm sorry, Mama.

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:42.600
I'm sorry, Mama.

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:43.600
I'm sorry, Mama.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:44.600
Mama, Papa.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.600
I'm sorry, Mama.

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.600
I'm sorry, Mama.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.600
We'll go grow up like broccoli grew.

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.600
My parents, we still thank you for looking after me.

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.600
But, I faced with a very very...

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.600
They're telling you all, aren't they?

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.600
Yes, because I took a flying saucer.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:11.600
Look, would you ask your parents to make mama a normal size again?

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:12.600
Yes, of course.

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.600
Fiddler grassly grassly girl.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.600
Don't bring him.

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.600
Oh, that's more like it.

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.320
Oh, oh, oh, dear, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no, stop, it's too much!

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry, but could you try again please?

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:42.360
I know, the more a mama there is, the better what you're getting very large, very large indeed.

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:46.360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:06.240
So movement valley hadn't really been invaded at all and the movements and the

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:11.000
friends that found out were aliens really looked like

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:35.800
happy and always at play the movements are having fun day after day the

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:46.880
movements the movements they love the laughter and they love the living the

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:57.240
movements believing and sharing and caring and giving the movements

01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:05.160
they're always happy and goes at play the movements are having fun day after day the

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:17.160
movements the movements the movements

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:45.640
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with me

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:56.960
therefore you want your TV they are the movements they are the movements so come with me give me your

01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:06.240
hand I'll take you up to a movement land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:18.880
with the movements there were the movements there were the movements there were the movements

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:58.880
there were the movements there were the movements there were the movements there were the movements

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:36.400
movement valley is enjoying another still peaceful summer's day however this lazy lifestyle no

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:47.440
matter how pleasant it might be does not suit everyone oh yes would you like a cup of coffee

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:57.840
dear yes I think I need one mama oh dear is it your memoirs I'm stuck ah can I help how can I

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:05.600
create in this in what in this sleepy atmosphere I've also come to a boring part when was that the time

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:17.200
I wrote poems were they any good no well miss that bit out then I can't I must put it down for

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:24.640
posterity it is my duty but how can I get inspiration here in this place when nothing ever happens

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:32.800
nothing ever happens at all oh I think this means another adventure yes mama that I need it to be

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:42.640
big exciting and frightening mama what's the matter are you all right your father says that

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:48.320
because nothing ever happens here he can't write so I'm looking for an adventure for him can you

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:54.240
think of anything he wants it to be big exciting and frightening does he want something really exciting

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:59.680
yes dear I'm afraid so I think I could manage that

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:12.080
that looks like the footprint of a huge monster

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:25.280
oh it's a good feeling giving others a bit of excitement

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:42.880
hey hey hey hey hey hey just a couple more yeah hey I'm praise the booboo I don't have to

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:47.360
the modest work very often yeah that was harder than I thought

01:33:50.160 --> 01:34:01.840
oh sleepy hands wake up everybody moment papa quickly get up moment mama a monster you've been

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:11.920
visited by a monster wake up before you eat in a line come on hurry hurry my what huge tracks

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.760
that's to keep them guessing for a while

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:22.240
hmm it could be a monster from the depths of the ocean

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:27.360
something's not right here don't you think it's a bit odd that it came directly to move

01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:30.720
well look at the footsteps they go in a straight line

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.720
someone must have told it to go to a moment house

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:42.560
and they're only going one way look there are tiny footsteps going back to the sea

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:48.000
oh now that the monster must still be here then oh well not necessarily

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:54.000
retracing one's own footsteps is the sign of an advanced intelligence stepping back exactly

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.160
the way you came the tough question is why would the monster do that one is led to believe that

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:06.320
it wants us to think it's still here when in fact it has gone back to wherever it came from

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:13.280
fiddle battle is my dear mother would say but why would it want us to think that papa it's a spy

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:19.360
oh it's a spy something it shouldn't it is hardly be a good spy if we knew they have to sneak in

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:29.440
and out I think it's still here I can feel it you know what I mean perhaps tonight tonight what

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:34.560
about tonight that's when they'll attack it's gone back to give its report how do you know that

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:42.800
papa well obviously that's why it still wants us to believe it's here yes what is it moving

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:48.560
something terrible is going to happen a monster is going to attack us tonight and papa's excited

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:58.160
about it oh good that's nice for him hurry everyone I expect the monster will be here soon

01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:11.440
now hold it still this is going to be a good barricade don't you think

01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:18.800
we'd better make sure it's big enough it's hardly any fun the tall playing tricks on them they're so

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:28.880
gullible if we catch the monster we can sell it to a zoo I'll handle the sale of course I'd rather

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:34.080
tame it and keep it as a pet well you could ride on it to go pigni-king

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:55.520
right now for the moat here we go hope the wells got enough water in it

01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:29.560
What was that?

01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:40.560
Mum and Papa, wake up!

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.560
Mum and Papa?

01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:59.560
Oh!

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.560
It tastes brackish!

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:13.560
We must be quite near the sea.

01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:30.560
That's a big one.

01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:45.560
Gotcha!

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:51.560
Momen, momen, where are you so far from home?

01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.560
Mum, at last!

01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.560
Look, I've got a big fish!

01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:58.560
Come and help me quickly!

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:00.560
Don't let it get away!

01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:12.560
I've never seen such a big fish movement!

01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:14.560
Just wait till Papa sees it!

01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:15.560
Oh, yes.

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:18.560
Mumen, Papa, this looks familiar.

01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:20.560
It's Mumen Valley, isn't it?

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:22.560
Of course it is, just outside the cave!

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:23.560
Oh dear.

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:26.560
I'm afraid that your father will be a bit disappointed.

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:28.560
Where is he then?

01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:30.560
Well...

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.560
He's gone, looking for adventure.

01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:35.560
Adventure? Where?

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:37.560
I don't really know.

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:38.560
Somewhere.

01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:40.560
I could have gone with him.

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:42.560
When's he coming home?

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:45.560
I'm afraid I don't know that either.

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:48.560
You know Papa, tonight, tomorrow night.

01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:50.560
Next Christmas?

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.560
Your guess is as good as mine, Mumen.

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:56.560
Wow! I bet he's having a great adventure right now!

01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:58.560
Hey, Mumma?

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:12.560
Mumma?

01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:16.560
Hello, where are you?

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:20.560
Oh, the cave dwellers must have her.

01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:22.560
Oh, Mumma.

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:32.560
Mumma!

01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:34.560
Mumma!

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:36.560
Can you hear me?

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.560
Oh!

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:48.560
Goodness, the sea.

01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:56.560
Oh, this looks like...

01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:00.560
Oh, it gets... oh, dear.

01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:06.560
Terry, me, I don't...

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:10.560
Oh, well...

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:12.560
Oh, my!

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:14.560
Oh, you see?

01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:16.560
It might be the...

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.560
Yes, it is.

01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:20.560
Oh, yeah, of course.

01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:22.560
Hellio, me.

01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:32.560
Oh, look! Look, it's Papa!

01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:34.560
Papa's back, everyone!

01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:36.560
Uh-huh.

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:38.560
Hey, Papa!

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:42.560
Ah, well...

01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:44.560
I'm back.

01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:46.560
I'm so pleased to see you again.

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:48.560
Thank you, Mumma.

01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.560
Papa, how was your adventure?

01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:52.560
Uh, unexpected.

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.560
Yes, that's what I'd say.

01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:56.560
Unexpected. Any food.

01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:58.560
Oh, yes. You can try mine first, Mumen, Papa.

01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:00.560
Oh, mine's the best. Try mine, Papa.

01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:02.560
Oh, that's good. I'm starving.

01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:04.560
Tell us about your adventure.

01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:06.560
I love you.

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:08.560
I love you.

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:10.560
Were you an immortal danger? Did you eat any rats?

01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:12.560
Yeah, I am.

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.560
Suppose there's adventure.

01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:16.560
I don't think Papa wants to talk about his adventure yet.

01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:18.560
Maybe later.

01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:22.560
And that was the end of Mumma and Papa's adventure.

01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:26.560
They didn't get far, but then you don't have to sometimes for things to happen.

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:30.560
Or at least for you to think they're happening.

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:38.560
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:46.560
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:50.560
They're always happy and always at play.

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:54.560
The movements are having fun day after day.

01:51:54.560 --> 01:52:02.560
The movements.

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:08.560
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:16.560
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:20.560
They're always happy and always at play.

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:24.560
The movements are having fun day after day.

01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:26.560
The movements.

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:30.560
The movements.

01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:36.560
The movements.

01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:56.560
The movements.

01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:00.560
Here they are for one and all.

01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:04.560
The movements are about to come.

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:08.560
Come on and sit down here with me.

01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:10.560
Therefore you want your TV.

01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:14.560
They are the movements.

01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:16.560
So come with me.

01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:18.560
Give me your hand.

01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:22.560
You can fly just like a bird.

01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:24.560
Sing the best song ever.

01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:28.560
There were the movements.

01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:32.560
There were the movements.

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:36.560
There were the movements.

01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:42.560
There were the movements.

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:52.560
There were the movements.

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:56.560
There were the movements.

01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:00.560
There were the movements.

01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:06.560
There were the movements.

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:16.560
There were the movements.

01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:32.560
It was the end of summer, but still every day seemed harder than the last.

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:38.560
The movement valley had no rain for weeks, and finally the river had dried up.

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:42.560
Papa says this weather is a catastrophe snuffing.

01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.560
But it is.

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:50.560
He says the movement valley will turn into a desert if it carries on.

01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:54.560
Papa can't ever remember it so hot, even the river has dried up.

01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:56.560
No, that does worry me.

01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:58.560
I can't fish anymore.

01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:04.560
The travels I found that droughts like this are always followed by a real heavy downpour.

01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:10.560
Well, it's too hot for me anyway.

01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:24.560
Oh, it's so hot I can't think.

01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:32.560
I can, I can always think of something.

01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:40.560
Well, well, even the weeds are wilting.

01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:52.560
The sea never dries up, does it?

01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:56.560
Of course not stupid wherever the fish go.

01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:00.560
I'm going swimming.

01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:30.560
Here you are.

01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:34.560
Watch this.

01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:44.560
Look at that.

01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:14.560
Ah!

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:24.560
Ah!

01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:36.560
Ah!

01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:38.560
Ouch, that hurt.

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:40.560
What's this stupid box doing here?

01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:42.560
I think it's floated from foreign lands.

01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:44.560
What's it got in it?

01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:46.560
Perhaps it's full of priceless jewels.

01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:50.560
No, it wouldn't float so high in the water if it was.

01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:52.560
A tiara packed in wood shavings.

01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:56.560
I could use a new comb too.

01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:58.560
What have you found you too?

01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:00.560
It's a treasure.

01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:02.560
No, we don't think so.

01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:04.560
It's not heavy enough.

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:06.560
But you never know, Snork Maiden.

01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:08.560
Let's open it and see.

01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:12.560
Come on, Slays, push me a shore.

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:14.560
Perhaps it's gold nuggets in here.

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:18.560
Our diamonds are something to eat.

01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:28.560
Ah!

01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:30.560
What is this?

01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:32.560
Seeds maybe.

01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:36.560
What sort of seeds?

01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.560
Hmm.

01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:42.560
Well, at first glance I'd say they might be tropical plants.

01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:44.560
Oh, really?

01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:46.560
What plants are tropical?

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:48.560
It's like banana or mango.

01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:50.560
Banana and mango.

01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:54.560
Well, I haven't done a lot of research on tropical plants so I can't be sure,

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:56.560
but they do look like it.

01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:58.560
I know, Mama. Why don't we plant them?

01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:00.560
Good idea, woman.

01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:04.560
The thing is, we don't have a tropical climate.

01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:06.560
I'm afraid they wouldn't grow here at all.

01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:08.560
Let's plant them, shall we?

01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:10.560
They won't bear any fruit, so don't get too excited.

01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:14.560
Oh, well, it seems tropical enough to me, Mr. Hanuman.

01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:16.560
At least we can try, can't we?

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:19.560
I want to see what papaya looks like and ugly fruit.

01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:22.560
I want mangoes growing all around my bedroom window.

01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:26.560
Let's plant them, shall we?

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:32.560
I tell you they're strictly tropical. They won't take root at all.

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:48.560
It certainly seems that Mama is enjoying herself, Mr. Hanuman.

01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:50.560
I don't think it'll be much use.

01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:54.560
Well, perhaps not, but it's still worth the farm in trying.

01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:58.560
Imagine, woman valley, a tropical jungle.

01:59:58.560 --> 02:00:04.560
Oh, Mr. Hanuman, do you think these seeds will grow into real fruit trees?

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:06.560
Hmm.

02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:13.560
Oh, Mr. Hanuman, do you think these seeds will grow into real fruit trees?

02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:15.560
Hmm, let me see.

02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:17.560
What have you got here, little my?

02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:23.560
I could very well be mistaken, but I think this one is a mango seed.

02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:25.560
Hmm, thanks.

02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:28.560
And why do you want to know, little my?

02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:30.560
Because I'm only growing fruit.

02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:35.560
I want to be sure I'm not planting stupid orchids or passion flowers or something.

02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:38.560
Ha, ha, ha.

02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:43.560
Mr. Hemuman, can you tell me which one of these is banana?

02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:46.560
Yeah, I'm not really too sure, but I think it's this one.

02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:49.560
Do you want to grow an orchid too, snorkemaiden?

02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:52.560
No, I just want to plant a banana tree in a really special place.

02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:56.560
It's Mouin's favorite fruit.

02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:03.560
I think she'll be disappointed bananas won't grow here.

02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:06.560
Hmm, this weather doesn't belong here either.

02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:08.560
If it gets any harder, I'll melt.

02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:10.560
I can't wait for dusk, so it'll cool down a bit.

02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:12.560
Hmm.

02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:25.560
Isn't it wonderful to go to sleep looking at the stars?

02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:27.560
And it's not so hot anymore.

02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:30.560
I'll sleep like a log tonight.

02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:33.560
Oh, you always do, don't you, little my?

02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:36.560
Well, I'll sleep like an extra heavy log, then.

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:46.560
Snorkemaiden, why don't you sleep under that tree with Mouin and little my?

02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:51.560
Oh, because I can't see the stars from there, and it makes me feel romantic looking at them.

02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:55.560
But you're going to get very wet if it starts raining in the night.

02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:57.560
You're joking, surely, Mama.

02:01:57.560 --> 02:01:59.560
Not at all.

02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:03.560
But it hasn't rained for ages, and there aren't any clouds or anything.

02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:05.560
Just stars.

02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:08.560
All the toothpicks fell on the floor, and that's a sure sign of rain.

02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:11.560
Snorkemaiden won't mind if she gets all wet, Lumen Mama.

02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:14.560
That should be happy.

02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.560
Who? Why is that?

02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:22.560
Because then she'll know that the special tree will start growing, and that's very important to her.

02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:24.560
That's true.

02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:28.560
Good night, everyone. I hope you sleep well.

02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:32.560
Good night, everybody.

02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:48.560
Good night, Lumen.

02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:50.560
Good night. Don't snore.

02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:53.560
Good night.

02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:09.560
It's too hot to sleep.

02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:12.560
Why don't you sleep outside like the children?

02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:14.560
I think I will.

02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:25.560
A thunderstorm.

02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:29.560
I told you the toothpicks are never wrong.

02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:41.560
Oh! Hey, it's raining, Lumen!

02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:44.560
Wake up, Lumen!

02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:46.560
Oh, is it morning?

02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:48.560
The sun's really bright.

02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:50.560
No, it's raining.

02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:52.560
Rainy?

02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:54.560
Look at that.

02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:57.560
You look, I'm getting wet. I'm going inside.

02:03:57.560 --> 02:03:59.560
So Mama was right about the rain.

02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:02.560
Hey, Snorkemaiden!

02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:04.560
Doesn't she look sweet?

02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:06.560
Snorkemaiden!

02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:08.560
Is it raining? That's very clever.

02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:11.560
Your mother knows everything doesn't she?

02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:12.560
She does.

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:13.560
Now let's get into the house.

02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:16.560
Not yet. I want to feel the rain on my face.

02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:19.560
It's been so long.

02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:25.560
Ha! Do you want to feel it much longer?

02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:21.560
Oh, it's stopped raining.

02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:32.560
Mangoes! That's impossible!

02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:34.560
Gosh!

02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:41.560
By my tail, a jungle! That's a tropical jungle!

02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:51.560
Wake up! Wake up, you two!

02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:55.560
There's a jungle outside. We've planted a jungle!

02:05:57.560 --> 02:06:00.560
A jungle?

02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:07.560
You're right, Moments. Those seeds have not only sprouted.

02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:09.560
I know. They're big trees.

02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:11.560
I've never known trees to grow like that.

02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:13.560
That's... that's...

02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:16.560
I think I'll go and play Tarzan.

02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:20.560
I wish my lettuce seeds would do that and move in, Papa.

02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:24.560
There's magic here somewhere, Mama. Let's go and explore.

02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:30.560
That's rain drumming on the campus.

02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:38.560
It must be...

02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:41.560
Snorkemaiden!

02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:45.560
What a nurse all this!

02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:49.560
Well, we found a crate of tropical seeds and planted them last night.

02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:52.560
And this morning, while you can see it's like magic.

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:54.560
It's fantastic.

02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:57.560
I know. We can go on a safari.

02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:04.560
I've seen nothing like it.

02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:08.560
What kind of flower is this?

02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:10.560
It looks like an orchid to me.

02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:13.560
This is a real tropical jungle, isn't it, Snorkemaiden?

02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:14.560
Not quite.

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:15.560
What do you mean?

02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:19.560
Well, Moomin, a real jungle would have wild animals in it, wouldn't it?

02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:21.560
Oh, yeah. Like tigers and snakes.

02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:25.560
This is more of a tropical botanical garden, I suppose.

02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:36.560
That's Moomin's little mind.

02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:38.560
He can have the peel.

02:07:41.560 --> 02:07:43.560
This is a life!

02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:48.560
Stop, Moomin!

02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:50.560
Well, well.

02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:55.560
What are you looking for, dear?

02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:56.560
My solar toady.

02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:57.560
You what?

02:07:57.560 --> 02:08:00.560
My sun helmet. I can't go into the jungle without it.

02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:02.560
I didn't know you had one.

02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:04.560
I used it for a fancy dress party once.

02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:06.560
Oh, I put it in a box.

02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:07.560
Oh, yeah.

02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:09.560
Oh, here it is.

02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:11.560
Very dashing, dear.

02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:12.560
I thought so, too.

02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:14.560
Oh, I know.

02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:33.560
Splendid protection is had.

02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:41.560
Papa?

02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:43.560
What in earth are you doing?

02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:45.560
I want to get into the cello.

02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:47.560
What for?

02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:49.560
To get my gun.

02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:50.560
Your gun?

02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:53.560
Only fools venture into the jungle without a proper gun.

02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:56.560
I don't think you need a gun, Papa.

02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:57.560
And why not?

02:08:57.560 --> 02:08:59.560
Because there aren't any wild animals.

02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:03.560
Well, one of the seas might have been an egg or something.

02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:07.560
Look at these, for instance, they look very animal.

02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:11.560
Very odd animals.

02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:13.560
More of an odd plant, I think.

02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:14.560
I'd stay away from them.

02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:16.560
They could be very dangerous.

02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:18.560
Look, they've got eyes.

02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:19.560
Careful.

02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:21.560
I think they're man-eating plants.

02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:23.560
Man-eating.

02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:26.560
Stop that.

02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:28.560
Help!

02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:29.560
Help!

02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:31.560
Oh, they're trying to eat me.

02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:33.560
But they want to feed me to their young.

02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:35.560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, help me!

02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:37.560
Oh, help!

02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:39.560
They're tearing my tail up!

02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:43.560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:45.560
Oh, no, oh, dear.

02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:49.560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.

02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:51.560
Help!

02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:57.560
Oh, oh, oh, no, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:09:57.560 --> 02:09:59.560
Well, done my little Maya.

02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:01.560
Just saved my life.

02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:03.560
Well, I saved your tail, anyway.

02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:05.560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:08.900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:10:08.900 --> 02:10:11.480
Get something to jam this door shut.

02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:14.040
Come on, hurry!

02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:20.620
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, we can't hold on much longer.

02:10:20.620 --> 02:10:22.620
Huh?

02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:38.620
That should keep them in now, shouldn't it?

02:10:38.620 --> 02:10:41.620
Well, I don't think they could push their way through that lot.

02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:43.620
They had a very strong grip on my tail.

02:10:43.620 --> 02:10:45.620
He mustn't underestimate them.

02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:46.620
Anything wrong?

02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:51.620
You bet! The seller's full of man-eating plants trying to gobble up moment papa!

02:10:51.620 --> 02:10:54.620
Oh! Oh my goodness!

02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:55.620
What's the matter?

02:10:55.620 --> 02:10:58.620
You can get straight from the seller into the kitchen!

02:10:58.620 --> 02:11:01.620
What? Oh no, mama!

02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:04.620
Oh my gosh!

02:11:14.620 --> 02:11:16.620
Oh, hello!

02:11:16.620 --> 02:11:18.620
Cue, we got here just in time!

02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:21.620
Whatever's the matter with you, are you all playing Tarzan?

02:11:21.620 --> 02:11:23.620
Oh no, mama!

02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:26.620
I'm making grandmas if you ever get a tropical fruit recipe.

02:11:26.620 --> 02:11:29.620
And perhaps now it's rained I can wash this dirty floor.

02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:39.620
Oh, by the great bumble, I don't believe this a tropical rainforest.

02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:44.620
Oh, a transcendentia megaloids.

02:11:44.620 --> 02:11:47.620
And yes, a dyspepsia floremon.

02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:52.620
Goodness me, I can collect a whole tropical hermoreum right here in moment valley.

02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:56.620
I try, well, that's what I need. I'll get one from the Mormons.

02:12:02.620 --> 02:12:05.620
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:10.620
Must say they're not the tiniest family, I'll have to move this.

02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:14.620
Oh, this old furniture.

02:12:25.620 --> 02:12:27.620
Do I look that funny?

02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:29.620
No, you look great!

02:12:29.620 --> 02:12:32.620
Maybe you and Tarzan have different muscles.

02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:34.620
Me, Tarzan!

02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:35.620
You, Jay!

02:12:35.620 --> 02:12:36.620
Oh, oh!

02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:38.620
Oh, here we go.

02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:41.620
Me, get out, or me, sick!

02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:44.620
Help!

02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:47.620
I've got man-eating plants after this!

02:12:47.620 --> 02:12:50.620
What? They must have come out!

02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:04.620
They were in the cellar.

02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:07.620
Did you open the door, Mr. Hamilon?

02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:10.620
Well, yes, I wanted to borrow a trowel.

02:13:10.620 --> 02:13:13.620
Mr. Hamilon, you know all about plants.

02:13:13.620 --> 02:13:15.620
Do you have any idea how we can get rid of them?

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:17.620
They're man-eaters, you know?

02:13:17.620 --> 02:13:19.620
Can't rid of them.

02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:22.620
Well, let's see. We are in a bit of a fix.

02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:25.620
I have heard that they react to music.

02:13:25.620 --> 02:13:27.620
Music.

02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:30.620
Snuffkin, you could play your harmonica.

02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:49.620
Look, they've started dancing.

02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:51.620
Keep it up, Snuffkin!

02:13:57.620 --> 02:14:00.620
Music.

02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:11.620
What will they do if he stops playing?

02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:13.620
I really don't know.

02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:21.620
Oh, what's this?

02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:33.620
They're rather sweet and they don't try to eat you.

02:14:33.620 --> 02:14:38.620
And that was how a tropical jungle grew and surrounded

02:14:38.620 --> 02:14:40.620
movement house in one night.

02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:43.620
Is it going to stay and for how long?

02:14:43.620 --> 02:14:48.620
And what will the man-eating plants do if Snuffkin stops playing?

02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:55.620
They love the laughter and they love the living.

02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:58.620
The movements.

02:14:58.620 --> 02:15:06.620
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:15:06.620 --> 02:15:10.620
They're always happy and always at play.

02:15:10.620 --> 02:15:14.620
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:15:14.620 --> 02:15:17.620
The movements.

02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:21.620
The movements.

02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:24.620
They love the laughter and they love the living.

02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:28.620
The movements.

02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:36.620
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:15:36.620 --> 02:15:40.620
They're always happy and always at play.

02:15:40.620 --> 02:15:43.620
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:47.620
The movements.

02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:50.620
The movements.

02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:53.620
The movements.

02:15:53.620 --> 02:15:56.620
The movements.

02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:19.620
Here they are for one and all.

02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:22.620
The movements are about to come.

02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:25.620
They want to sit down here with me.

02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:28.620
They're here for you on your TV.

02:16:28.620 --> 02:16:31.620
They are the movements.

02:16:31.620 --> 02:16:34.620
They are the movements.

02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:37.620
So come with me, give me your hand.

02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:40.620
I'll take you up to a moment land.

02:16:40.620 --> 02:16:43.620
You can fly just like a bird.

02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:46.620
Sing the best song ever.

02:16:46.620 --> 02:16:49.620
There were the movements.

02:16:49.620 --> 02:16:52.620
There were the movements.

02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:55.620
There were the movements.

02:16:55.620 --> 02:16:58.620
There were the movements.

02:16:58.620 --> 02:17:01.620
There were the movements.

02:17:19.620 --> 02:17:45.820
The seeds that movement and his friends had found in a box that had been cast up on the

02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:53.820
beach had grown into a tropical forest. It was beautiful but also dangerous with man-eating plants

02:17:53.820 --> 02:18:01.820
kept at bay by snuffkin playing his harmonica, but for how long?

02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:23.820
snuffkin don't stop playing your harmonica whatever you do or they'll only get angry and attack us all over again.

02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:27.820
If I don't stop soon I might never want to play again.

02:18:29.820 --> 02:18:33.820
Well perhaps the music has made them more friendly.

02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:38.820
Be careful Mr. Himmelon. Oh don't worry.

02:18:46.820 --> 02:18:48.820
Mr. Himmelon look out.

02:18:52.820 --> 02:18:54.820
I want him.

02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:57.820
I don't think the quickly snuffkin play again.

02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:27.820
Papa we must make sure the trap door won't open again.

02:19:27.820 --> 02:19:30.820
Oh yes. What's this about a trap door?

02:19:30.820 --> 02:19:35.820
In the kitchen they almost got him before in the tag mama. We reached her just in time.

02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:38.820
Oh there they are.

02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:08.820
I feel sorry for them.

02:20:19.820 --> 02:20:26.820
It can't be helped snuffkin. If we let them out we'll be eaten alive.

02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:33.820
It makes me feel very uncomfortable having man-eating plants under the floor.

02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:38.820
Always keep a kettle of boiling water handy in case they break through.

02:20:38.820 --> 02:20:41.820
The children are playing Tarzan.

02:20:41.820 --> 02:20:45.820
They might as well seeing as they've got a jungle to play in.

02:20:45.820 --> 02:20:48.820
Still planting those seeds might have been a terrible mistake.

02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:57.820
Well mama I'm very glad that you did. Just think what I would have missed and movement values suddenly being full of tropical plants is wonderful.

02:20:57.820 --> 02:21:01.820
I'm not fond of traveling as you know and you've brought the plants to me.

02:21:02.820 --> 02:21:08.820
Well the trees make it much cooler but those man-eaters who I could do without them.

02:21:16.820 --> 02:21:18.820
You're just like Tarzan.

02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:20.820
Tarzan loves Jane.

02:21:20.820 --> 02:21:22.820
Oh what bliss.

02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:27.820
Stinky's over there.

02:21:27.820 --> 02:21:30.820
Tarzan teach old Betty's lesson.

02:21:45.820 --> 02:21:50.820
Pretty stupid moment playing Tarzan without wild animals.

02:21:50.820 --> 02:21:52.820
Animals don't come from seeds.

02:21:52.820 --> 02:21:56.820
No but you need them to have a real jungle. I can get you some if you want.

02:21:56.820 --> 02:21:57.820
Really?

02:21:57.820 --> 02:21:59.820
How do anything for my friends?

02:21:59.820 --> 02:22:04.820
That's very kind of you. Not too wild though. No lions or tigers or anything.

02:22:04.820 --> 02:22:07.820
Maybe it maybe chimpanzee.

02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:10.820
I know exactly what you need.

02:22:13.820 --> 02:22:15.820
Cheese.

02:22:15.820 --> 02:22:17.820
Bread.

02:22:21.820 --> 02:22:23.820
What are you doing mama?

02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:27.820
Well I don't like the thought of all those man-eaters still in the cellar.

02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:30.820
So your father and I are going to sleep in the bathhouse.

02:22:30.820 --> 02:22:34.820
We'll sleep outdoors too. We've just built ourselves a hut.

02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:36.820
Snorke maiden and little Mai too.

02:22:36.820 --> 02:22:38.820
Oh yes there's plenty of room.

02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:42.820
Oh right so that only leaves Mr. Himmel and sleeping in the house.

02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:45.820
And he still busy checking all the different plants.

02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:49.820
Mama is everything ready?

02:22:49.820 --> 02:22:51.820
Oh yes dear.

02:22:54.820 --> 02:22:56.820
Oh I'm already.

02:22:56.820 --> 02:22:58.820
Yes we are Mr. Himmel and.

02:22:58.820 --> 02:23:00.820
See you later.

02:23:06.820 --> 02:23:10.820
Stinky said he could get some wild animals papa.

02:23:10.820 --> 02:23:12.820
We'll have a frog.

02:23:12.820 --> 02:23:13.820
I don't know.

02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:16.820
I wouldn't trust him. He'll probably put a head jog in your sleeping bag.

02:23:16.820 --> 02:23:19.820
There it is. The hut.

02:23:19.820 --> 02:23:22.820
Oh very well built.

02:23:49.820 --> 02:23:57.820
I tell you it's a wonderful place you love it. A real tropical jungle.

02:23:57.820 --> 02:23:59.820
Are you sure it's quite nice here?

02:23:59.820 --> 02:24:03.820
Of course I am. There you are.

02:24:03.820 --> 02:24:05.820
Oh.

02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:26.820
Oh lovely it is to run free.

02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:33.820
Darling let's be the first to get to Moomin Valley.

02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:40.820
Soon I'll have the largest collection in the botanic world.

02:24:40.820 --> 02:24:45.820
And I will be famous and people will come from all over.

02:24:45.820 --> 02:24:50.820
Now what have we here?

02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:53.820
I don't know.

02:24:53.820 --> 02:25:00.820
Go away I'm not a zoologist.

02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:05.820
Look Moomin those must be the monkey stinky promise.

02:25:05.820 --> 02:25:10.820
Well that's a surprise not like him at all.

02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:14.820
I don't know.

02:25:15.820 --> 02:25:20.820
Look Moomin those must be the monkey stinky promise.

02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:23.820
Well that's a surprise not like him at all.

02:25:23.820 --> 02:25:27.820
I just don't trust him.

02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:28.820
What sweet things.

02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:32.820
Just like in Tarzan.

02:25:32.820 --> 02:25:35.820
What was that?

02:25:35.820 --> 02:25:37.820
I don't know.

02:25:37.820 --> 02:25:46.820
That sounds like some really wild animal.

02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:48.820
A lion or a tiger.

02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:55.820
I'm frightened Moomin.

02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:06.820
Very odd just like home isn't it even if it isn't very big?

02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:08.820
Perhaps we could live here.

02:26:08.820 --> 02:26:12.820
Let's go hunting first I smell Moomin's.

02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:20.820
Oh be careful darling you're very out of practice.

02:26:20.820 --> 02:26:26.820
I must warn them.

02:26:26.820 --> 02:26:28.820
See anything?

02:26:28.820 --> 02:26:29.820
No other thing.

02:26:29.820 --> 02:26:33.820
It must have been imagination.

02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:35.820
Moomin.

02:26:35.820 --> 02:26:37.820
Keep quiet.

02:26:37.820 --> 02:26:40.820
I've just seen some tigers they're coming to get you.

02:26:40.820 --> 02:26:41.820
Tigers.

02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:43.820
Let's get back to the house quick.

02:26:43.820 --> 02:26:46.820
There's no time they're nearly here.

02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:50.820
We'll go to the bathhouse.

02:27:04.820 --> 02:27:06.820
Shall we eat him up?

02:27:06.820 --> 02:27:10.820
You know that Hamilins upset your tummy dearest.

02:27:10.820 --> 02:27:14.820
I wonder where the Moomin's are.

02:27:14.820 --> 02:27:17.820
Huh?

02:27:20.820 --> 02:27:24.820
Just more animals that's all.

02:27:25.820 --> 02:27:31.820
Papa!

02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:34.820
Papa help!

02:27:39.820 --> 02:27:41.820
What's the matter Moomin?

02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:44.820
Little Maya's seen two tigers and they're looking for us.

02:27:44.820 --> 02:27:45.820
Tigers after us.

02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:49.820
That rotten sticky probably told them we're good to eat or something.

02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:51.820
Maybe we are.

02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:53.820
They'll be here in a minute.

02:27:53.820 --> 02:27:56.820
Right Moomin, you go and find the biggest stone you can

02:27:56.820 --> 02:27:58.820
and bring it back with you.

02:27:58.820 --> 02:28:00.820
Okay.

02:28:09.820 --> 02:28:12.820
This way.

02:28:23.820 --> 02:28:25.820
Papa will this one do?

02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:26.820
Yes, that's perfect.

02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:29.820
Right, get into the bathhouse and it's quickly now.

02:28:54.820 --> 02:28:56.820
Here they come.

02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:04.820
Are you really going to eat them, dearest?

02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:05.820
Of course, my love.

02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:09.820
You see, I think they're hiding in that little house up there.

02:29:09.820 --> 02:29:13.820
They're being very quiet if they are.

02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:18.820
Huh, they're just too scared to move. That's all.

02:29:18.820 --> 02:29:21.820
Why's that stone there?

02:29:24.820 --> 02:29:26.820
Whoa!

02:29:29.820 --> 02:29:31.820
My darling!

02:29:31.820 --> 02:29:32.820
It worked, Papa!

02:29:32.820 --> 02:29:34.820
Well, of course, Moomin.

02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:38.820
My husband is drowning.

02:29:38.820 --> 02:29:42.820
Oh, I'm so sorry. Papa, we must help.

02:29:42.820 --> 02:29:45.820
He was just about to try and eat us, Mama.

02:29:45.820 --> 02:29:48.820
I'm sure he won't do it again.

02:29:49.820 --> 02:29:53.820
I suppose so, Moomin.

02:30:12.820 --> 02:30:14.820
Oh, my love!

02:30:14.820 --> 02:30:16.820
I never thought I'd see the day.

02:30:16.820 --> 02:30:19.820
Moomin's rescuing a tiger.

02:30:20.820 --> 02:30:21.820
Here you are, dear.

02:30:21.820 --> 02:30:24.820
Tie this tightly around him and we'll lift him out.

02:30:24.820 --> 02:30:26.820
Thank you, Mama.

02:30:44.820 --> 02:30:46.820
Oh, darling.

02:30:47.820 --> 02:30:49.820
Oh, you are right, my love.

02:30:49.820 --> 02:30:51.820
What happened? Did we eat them?

02:30:51.820 --> 02:30:53.820
No, you were drowning and they rescued you.

02:30:53.820 --> 02:30:56.820
Oh, now embarrassing.

02:30:56.820 --> 02:30:59.820
Well, they're in that cabin behind you if you still feel hungry,

02:30:59.820 --> 02:31:02.820
but it was rather good of them to save you.

02:31:02.820 --> 02:31:05.820
No, my appetite's completely gone.

02:31:05.820 --> 02:31:07.820
We'll come back here then and we'll go.

02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:09.820
I'll just jump over.

02:31:14.820 --> 02:31:16.820
Oh.

02:31:16.820 --> 02:31:18.820
What's the matter?

02:31:18.820 --> 02:31:20.820
I can't remember how to jump.

02:31:20.820 --> 02:31:22.820
We've been stuck in that zoo for too long.

02:31:22.820 --> 02:31:24.820
Well, try and swim across, dear.

02:31:26.820 --> 02:31:28.820
Okay.

02:31:30.820 --> 02:31:32.820
Hmm?

02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:42.820
Wake up, everyone. The tiger's all leaving.

02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:44.820
I'm glad he didn't grow.

02:31:48.820 --> 02:31:52.820
I knew they wouldn't be mean enough to eat us after saving him.

02:31:52.820 --> 02:31:55.820
Shall we jump in and swim back as well? It's not far.

02:31:55.820 --> 02:31:58.820
Oh, yes. I'll go first.

02:31:58.820 --> 02:32:00.820
I want to go first.

02:32:00.820 --> 02:32:03.820
Darling, are you all right? Be careful, Moomin.

02:32:03.820 --> 02:32:05.820
Look over there.

02:32:10.820 --> 02:32:11.820
Crocodiles.

02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:15.820
Oh, hurry up, Moomin. Swim around the back and come up the ladder.

02:32:26.820 --> 02:32:29.820
How can there be crocodiles in the sea?

02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:31.820
I thought they only lived in fresh water.

02:32:31.820 --> 02:32:33.820
How are we going to get back to the shore now?

02:32:33.820 --> 02:32:36.820
We'll have to wait for a boat to come past.

02:32:36.820 --> 02:32:39.820
No, I'm afraid we'll have to think of something else, Mama.

02:32:39.820 --> 02:32:43.820
We could have been waiting for a wink or so for that to happen.

02:32:43.820 --> 02:32:45.820
A whole week!

02:32:45.820 --> 02:32:49.820
But we'll starve. All they'll find is our bones bleached, waiting to sun.

02:32:49.820 --> 02:32:53.820
Don't worry, little mind. Papa will think of something you'll see.

02:32:53.820 --> 02:32:55.820
Good morning.

02:32:56.820 --> 02:32:59.820
Snuffkin, what are you leaving?

02:32:59.820 --> 02:33:03.820
I was going to go sea fishing, but I changed my mind.

02:33:03.820 --> 02:33:06.820
I didn't fancy landing a sea monster.

02:33:10.820 --> 02:33:16.820
Help! Someone help! Help anybody!

02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:18.820
That's Mr. Hemmulin.

02:33:18.820 --> 02:33:21.820
Oh, the tigers must be after him quickly.

02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:33.820
Who had ever made you so cross?

02:33:33.820 --> 02:33:36.820
I just told you not to eat my plants.

02:33:37.820 --> 02:33:40.820
Please, someone help!

02:33:44.820 --> 02:33:46.820
Let me in!

02:33:54.820 --> 02:33:56.820
That fella's always been clumsy.

02:33:56.820 --> 02:33:58.820
We can't really help him.

02:33:58.820 --> 02:34:00.820
No.

02:34:01.820 --> 02:34:02.820
Oh!

02:34:05.820 --> 02:34:07.820
Are you alright, Hemmulin?

02:34:07.820 --> 02:34:09.820
Oh, dear, I think so.

02:34:09.820 --> 02:34:11.820
What about you?

02:34:11.820 --> 02:34:14.820
What do you do when a rhino gets stuck in your brando?

02:34:14.820 --> 02:34:16.820
This is a new one on me.

02:34:16.820 --> 02:34:18.820
So I'm loose. I can't think of any other way.

02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:20.820
You have to be very careful, though.

02:34:20.820 --> 02:34:22.820
I think you're right.

02:34:22.820 --> 02:34:24.820
Yes, thank you.

02:34:31.820 --> 02:34:33.820
Ah, look where you're going.

02:34:33.820 --> 02:34:36.820
It was you who brought all the animals in, wasn't it?

02:34:36.820 --> 02:34:38.820
Yes, you're right. That's what you wanted.

02:34:38.820 --> 02:34:40.820
It's a jungle now. I did a good job.

02:34:40.820 --> 02:34:43.820
Oh, really? Well, they're not wild animals at all.

02:34:43.820 --> 02:34:45.820
They're quite friendly.

02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:47.820
Friendly?

02:35:01.820 --> 02:35:03.820
Hmm.

02:35:08.820 --> 02:35:09.820
See what I mean?

02:35:09.820 --> 02:35:10.820
They make very good pets.

02:35:10.820 --> 02:35:12.820
Cute, aren't they?

02:35:20.820 --> 02:35:23.820
Snake! Go stick where are you?

02:35:25.820 --> 02:35:26.820
Why do you want?

02:35:26.820 --> 02:35:29.820
The rhino and the tigers have become pets of the movement family.

02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:32.820
You're not going to let that happen to you.

02:35:32.820 --> 02:35:33.820
Well, are you?

02:35:33.820 --> 02:35:34.820
It's not.

02:35:34.820 --> 02:35:36.820
I'll bring snorked maiden and movement here tonight.

02:35:36.820 --> 02:35:38.820
There's no need to eat all of them.

02:35:38.820 --> 02:35:41.820
Just bite off their tails, all right?

02:35:41.820 --> 02:35:43.820
Okay.

02:35:45.820 --> 02:35:47.820
You'll be really amazed like I was.

02:35:47.820 --> 02:35:50.820
It's big enough for both of you to sit on.

02:35:50.820 --> 02:35:52.820
How lovely. A giant water lily.

02:35:52.820 --> 02:35:56.820
I wonder if the seeds came from that box you all found.

02:35:56.820 --> 02:35:58.820
Oh, I can't wait to see it.

02:35:59.820 --> 02:36:01.820
Looking at the size of the jungle,

02:36:01.820 --> 02:36:04.820
there must have been an awful lot of seeds in that box.

02:36:04.820 --> 02:36:07.820
I suppose the wind could have blown them anywhere.

02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:11.820
Where's the giant water lily?

02:36:11.820 --> 02:36:13.820
Let's see now.

02:36:13.820 --> 02:36:15.820
Over there.

02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:23.820
How wonderful.

02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:26.820
You see, I wish you'd learn to trust me.

02:36:26.820 --> 02:36:29.820
It's a very honest guy.

02:36:29.820 --> 02:36:32.820
It's so soft and pink and beautiful.

02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:41.820
How romantic to be on a boat made from a flower.

02:36:41.820 --> 02:36:43.820
This is unbelievable.

02:36:43.820 --> 02:36:46.820
Our old box seems to have grown into a tropical swamp.

02:36:46.820 --> 02:36:48.820
It's a lot nicer.

02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:50.820
Hey, stinky.

02:36:50.820 --> 02:36:52.820
Stinky?

02:36:52.820 --> 02:36:55.820
Oh, I can't see him anywhere.

02:36:57.820 --> 02:37:00.820
I wonder how far we'll float.

02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:02.820
It's getting dark, moment.

02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:15.820
Gotcha.

02:37:15.820 --> 02:37:17.820
We must get away.

02:37:17.820 --> 02:37:19.820
I don't know yet.

02:37:19.820 --> 02:37:21.820
Look, there's the seed.

02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:23.820
Put the crooked aisles.

02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:25.820
Over there, snorkemaid.

02:37:25.820 --> 02:37:26.820
I suppose.

02:37:26.820 --> 02:37:30.820
Well, it's the only way we'll get away from this monster.

02:37:48.820 --> 02:37:50.820
Keep going, snorkmaid.

02:37:50.820 --> 02:37:52.820
We're almost there.

02:37:53.820 --> 02:37:55.820
Wait.

02:37:55.820 --> 02:37:59.820
Moomin and snorkmaid kept swimming as fast as they could.

02:37:59.820 --> 02:38:01.820
They had a head start on the snake,

02:38:01.820 --> 02:38:03.820
but now he was catching up.

02:38:03.820 --> 02:38:06.820
Even though movements are very good swimmers,

02:38:06.820 --> 02:38:09.820
unfortunately for them, so are snakes.

02:38:12.820 --> 02:38:14.820
They love the laughter,

02:38:14.820 --> 02:38:18.820
and they love the living the movements.

02:38:19.820 --> 02:38:26.820
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:30.820
They're always happy and always at play.

02:38:30.820 --> 02:38:34.820
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:38:34.820 --> 02:38:37.820
The movements.

02:38:37.820 --> 02:38:41.820
The movements.

02:38:41.820 --> 02:38:43.820
They love the laughter,

02:38:43.820 --> 02:38:47.820
and they love the living the movements.

02:38:48.820 --> 02:38:55.820
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:38:55.820 --> 02:38:59.820
They're always happy and always at play.

02:38:59.820 --> 02:39:03.820
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:39:03.820 --> 02:39:06.820
The movements.

02:39:06.820 --> 02:39:10.820
The movements.

02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:16.820
The movements.

02:39:18.820 --> 02:39:23.820
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:39:49.820 --> 02:39:53.820
They are the movements.

02:39:53.820 --> 02:39:56.820
So come with me, give me your hand.

02:39:56.820 --> 02:39:59.820
I'll take you up to a moment land.

02:39:59.820 --> 02:40:02.820
You can fly just like a bird.

02:40:02.820 --> 02:40:04.820
Sing that song ever.

02:40:04.820 --> 02:40:07.820
There were the movements.

02:40:07.820 --> 02:40:10.820
There were the movements.

02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:13.820
There were the movements.

02:40:13.820 --> 02:40:16.820
There were the movements.

02:40:16.820 --> 02:40:21.820
There were the movements.

02:40:46.820 --> 02:40:51.820
There were the movements.

02:40:51.820 --> 02:40:56.820
There were the movements.

02:40:56.820 --> 02:41:04.820
There were the movements.

02:41:04.820 --> 02:41:07.820
Move in.

02:41:07.820 --> 02:41:09.820
Where are you moving?

02:41:09.820 --> 02:41:12.820
It's not made in.

02:41:12.820 --> 02:41:15.820
The rhino and the tigers that stinky set free from the zoo

02:41:15.820 --> 02:41:18.820
are now living in the jungle that has grown up around movement house

02:41:18.820 --> 02:41:24.820
and have settled into the restful life of movement valley.

02:41:24.820 --> 02:41:26.820
Hey, have you seen movement?

02:41:26.820 --> 02:41:29.820
No, you haven't seen him all evening.

02:41:29.820 --> 02:41:33.820
I wonder where they got to.

02:41:33.820 --> 02:41:36.820
Meanwhile, movement and snort made and chased by the snake

02:41:36.820 --> 02:41:41.820
are swimming as fast as they can out to sea.

02:41:41.820 --> 02:41:43.820
I can't swim another.

02:41:43.820 --> 02:41:47.820
Snort must snort made and you must.

02:41:47.820 --> 02:41:54.820
Hey, hey you there.

02:41:54.820 --> 02:41:57.820
Come on, snort made and nearly there.

02:41:57.820 --> 02:41:59.820
Look, there's a couple of hippos.

02:41:59.820 --> 02:42:00.820
They're coming towards us.

02:42:00.820 --> 02:42:01.820
We better get them on board.

02:42:01.820 --> 02:42:02.820
That's funny.

02:42:02.820 --> 02:42:06.820
I haven't heard about any hippos reported missing from the zoo lately.

02:42:06.820 --> 02:42:16.820
Just a bit further snort made it.

02:42:16.820 --> 02:42:18.820
We made it.

02:42:18.820 --> 02:42:22.820
I didn't know hippos could climb so well.

02:42:22.820 --> 02:42:24.820
Oh, thank you so much.

02:42:24.820 --> 02:42:26.820
There was a huge snake chasing us.

02:42:26.820 --> 02:42:29.820
Yes, we saw you were lucky we came along when we did.

02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:30.820
Thank you for your help.

02:42:30.820 --> 02:42:32.820
Whose ship is this?

02:42:32.820 --> 02:42:33.820
ours.

02:42:33.820 --> 02:42:34.820
We're from the zoo.

02:42:34.820 --> 02:42:37.820
Oh, you've got one of the crocodiles.

02:42:37.820 --> 02:42:40.820
Yes, and a lot of trouble he gave us as well.

02:42:40.820 --> 02:42:42.820
There's another one around here somewhere.

02:42:42.820 --> 02:42:43.820
We saw them.

02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:46.820
Yes, we know there is, but we haven't been able to find him yet.

02:42:46.820 --> 02:42:50.820
Oh boy, I wish they'd come as quietly as you hippos did.

02:42:50.820 --> 02:42:51.820
Hippos.

02:42:51.820 --> 02:42:52.820
Hippos.

02:42:52.820 --> 02:42:53.820
Hippos.

02:42:53.820 --> 02:42:54.820
Which zoo are you from?

02:42:54.820 --> 02:42:56.820
I bet they'd pay well to get you back.

02:42:56.820 --> 02:42:57.820
Now, look here.

02:42:57.820 --> 02:42:59.820
I'm a woman, not a hippo.

02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:01.820
Are you saying that I look like a hippo?

02:43:01.820 --> 02:43:04.820
Well, perhaps they don't look exactly like a hippo.

02:43:04.820 --> 02:43:07.820
No, but they're close enough, Captain.

02:43:07.820 --> 02:43:10.820
I'm sure they've escaped from the zoo somewhere, though.

02:43:10.820 --> 02:43:11.820
Yes, sir.

02:43:11.820 --> 02:43:13.820
We haven't escaped from anywhere.

02:43:13.820 --> 02:43:14.820
Certainly not a zoo.

02:43:14.820 --> 02:43:15.820
We live in Moomin Valley.

02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:16.820
We're Moomin's.

02:43:16.820 --> 02:43:17.820
It's all right, Snork Maiden.

02:43:17.820 --> 02:43:19.820
I'll not be taken for a hippo.

02:43:19.820 --> 02:43:21.820
Come on, let's run for it.

02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:22.820
Hey, wait.

02:43:22.820 --> 02:43:24.820
There's a nice cozy cage already for you.

02:43:24.820 --> 02:43:26.820
Hurry, Snork Maiden.

02:43:26.820 --> 02:43:27.820
Ask to them.

02:43:27.820 --> 02:43:28.820
Stop them now.

02:43:28.820 --> 02:43:30.820
Don't let them get away.

02:43:31.820 --> 02:43:33.820
Where are we going, Moomin?

02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:34.820
Now, let's see.

02:43:37.820 --> 02:43:39.820
Quickly, man, lower the live boat.

02:43:39.820 --> 02:43:42.820
If they're not going to put us in any zoo.

02:43:46.820 --> 02:43:48.820
Why did you come back?

02:43:48.820 --> 02:43:50.820
I thought you were on the boat.

02:43:50.820 --> 02:43:51.820
Oh, no.

02:43:51.820 --> 02:43:52.820
Don't worry.

02:43:52.820 --> 02:43:54.820
I never eat anything when I'm not swimming.

02:43:54.820 --> 02:43:55.820
Are you sure?

02:43:55.820 --> 02:43:56.820
I'm sure.

02:43:56.820 --> 02:43:58.820
Now where's this ship?

02:43:59.820 --> 02:44:01.820
Oh, they're catching up with us.

02:44:01.820 --> 02:44:03.820
They want to put us in a cage and take us to the zoo.

02:44:03.820 --> 02:44:05.820
Me too, I expect.

02:44:05.820 --> 02:44:07.820
They're always trying to get me.

02:44:07.820 --> 02:44:08.820
They've got one of the crocodiles.

02:44:08.820 --> 02:44:09.820
Oh, did they?

02:44:09.820 --> 02:44:10.820
They were my friends.

02:44:10.820 --> 02:44:11.820
Right.

02:44:11.820 --> 02:44:12.820
Hang on to me, you two.

02:44:12.820 --> 02:44:15.820
I'm certainly not going back to any zoo.

02:44:15.820 --> 02:44:16.820
Never, let's go.

02:44:18.820 --> 02:44:19.820
Oh, no.

02:44:19.820 --> 02:44:20.820
Now hold on tight.

02:44:22.820 --> 02:44:23.820
Come back.

02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:24.820
You horrible ripper.

02:44:24.820 --> 02:44:25.820
Come back.

02:44:29.820 --> 02:44:31.820
The moment's been caught by a big snake.

02:44:31.820 --> 02:44:34.820
Yes, mama snorked maiden as well.

02:44:34.820 --> 02:44:36.820
Dear stinky, that's not true, is it?

02:44:36.820 --> 02:44:39.820
I wish people wouldn't realize that I almost never lie.

02:44:39.820 --> 02:44:42.820
I'm sorry about them, but I thought I'd better tell you.

02:44:42.820 --> 02:44:45.820
Oh, there aren't any snakes that big in movement valley.

02:44:45.820 --> 02:44:47.820
There are tigers here, aren't there?

02:44:47.820 --> 02:44:49.820
Well, there's big snakes too.

02:44:49.820 --> 02:44:51.820
You brought the snake here, didn't you?

02:44:51.820 --> 02:44:54.820
Papa, I'm not saying that I believe him.

02:44:54.820 --> 02:44:57.820
But I think we'd better look for them just to be on the safe side, don't you?

02:44:58.820 --> 02:44:59.820
Okay, don't believe me.

02:44:59.820 --> 02:45:01.820
I've told you so my conscience is clear.

02:45:01.820 --> 02:45:04.820
Where exactly did the snake attack them, stinky?

02:45:04.820 --> 02:45:06.820
Down in the swamp by the sea.

02:45:06.820 --> 02:45:07.820
Let's go, mama.

02:45:08.820 --> 02:45:09.820
I'll come with you.

02:45:09.820 --> 02:45:13.820
No, you'd better stay little my until movement where we've gone if he comes back.

02:45:13.820 --> 02:45:16.820
He'll only worry if there's no one here.

02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:18.820
And stinky, you'll show us where to go.

02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:19.820
Okay.

02:45:20.820 --> 02:45:22.820
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:45:22.820 --> 02:45:24.820
Oh, I'll move.

02:45:24.820 --> 02:45:25.820
Hey, you!

02:45:25.820 --> 02:45:27.820
Have you eaten, movement, and snork made it?

02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:29.820
It's all right, mama. We're here.

02:45:29.820 --> 02:45:31.820
Oh, praise the boobie-goobie-goobie-goobie-goobie-goobie-goobie.

02:45:31.820 --> 02:45:33.820
Me time, you friend.

02:45:33.820 --> 02:45:35.820
You're a very big friend.

02:45:35.820 --> 02:45:38.820
Please come in as much of you as you like.

02:45:38.820 --> 02:45:40.820
Stinky just told us that you and Snork's are here.

02:45:40.820 --> 02:45:42.820
Hey, you, I'm here.

02:45:42.820 --> 02:45:43.820
Hey, you, I'm here.

02:45:43.820 --> 02:45:44.820
Hey, you, I'm here.

02:45:44.820 --> 02:45:45.820
Hey, you, I'm here.

02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:46.820
Hey, you, I'm here.

02:45:46.820 --> 02:45:47.820
Hey, you, I'm here.

02:45:47.820 --> 02:45:49.820
Stinky just told us that you and Snork made it

02:45:49.820 --> 02:45:51.820
been caught by a big snake, so we...

02:45:51.820 --> 02:45:53.820
Where are you going, Stinky?

02:45:53.820 --> 02:45:56.820
She did chase us at first.

02:45:56.820 --> 02:45:58.820
Then we managed to get on a boat, but they wanted

02:45:58.820 --> 02:45:59.820
to put us in a cage.

02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:01.820
So we jumped back in the sea, met the snake again.

02:46:01.820 --> 02:46:03.820
Then they tried to catch her too.

02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:05.820
So she helped us to get away, and now she's our friend.

02:46:05.820 --> 02:46:07.820
Who are they?

02:46:07.820 --> 02:46:08.820
Men from the zoo.

02:46:08.820 --> 02:46:11.820
They've come to recapture all the animals and take them away

02:46:11.820 --> 02:46:14.820
from the jungle and put them in cages again.

02:46:14.820 --> 02:46:15.820
Nice.

02:46:15.820 --> 02:46:17.820
Secondly, don't want to go back to the zoo.

02:46:17.820 --> 02:46:20.820
Papa, we've got to protect our friends.

02:46:20.820 --> 02:46:21.820
Yes, we have.

02:46:21.820 --> 02:46:24.820
I'm sure that the tigers and that nice rhino don't want to

02:46:24.820 --> 02:46:25.820
go back even.

02:46:25.820 --> 02:46:27.820
Oh, of course they don't.

02:46:27.820 --> 02:46:29.820
They want to be free and live in our jungle.

02:46:29.820 --> 02:46:31.820
Why don't you go and explore it?

02:46:31.820 --> 02:46:33.820
I'm sure it'll be just like home.

02:46:33.820 --> 02:46:35.820
And if you see the zoo people, you can come back here,

02:46:35.820 --> 02:46:37.820
can't you?

02:46:37.820 --> 02:46:39.820
I'm sure you'll like it here, Mrs. Snake.

02:46:39.820 --> 02:46:41.820
Yes, I'm sure I will.

02:46:41.820 --> 02:46:43.820
Come on, I'll show you the jungle.

02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:50.820
I'm so relieved that you're both all right at home.

02:46:50.820 --> 02:46:54.820
So are we, Mama, but there's something we haven't told you.

02:46:54.820 --> 02:46:57.820
Yes, they thought we were hippopotamuses.

02:46:57.820 --> 02:46:58.820
What?

02:46:58.820 --> 02:46:59.820
Who did?

02:46:59.820 --> 02:47:01.820
They need their eyes, Destiny.

02:47:01.820 --> 02:47:03.820
The men from the zoo.

02:47:03.820 --> 02:47:05.820
They thought we had escaped from another zoo,

02:47:05.820 --> 02:47:08.820
and we're trying to catch us, and they nearly succeeded.

02:47:08.820 --> 02:47:09.820
How rude.

02:47:09.820 --> 02:47:12.820
We're not at all like hippos, the cheek of it.

02:47:12.820 --> 02:47:15.820
So these men were only trying to capture our new friends,

02:47:15.820 --> 02:47:17.820
but you and Snork Maiden as well.

02:47:17.820 --> 02:47:19.820
And me and Papa if they'd known about us.

02:47:19.820 --> 02:47:20.820
That's right, Mama.

02:47:20.820 --> 02:47:21.820
They're idiots.

02:47:21.820 --> 02:47:24.820
Hippopotamuses don't wear aprons or right memoirs.

02:47:24.820 --> 02:47:26.820
That's really made me angry.

02:47:26.820 --> 02:47:30.820
I bet they never faced the wrath of a movement Papa before.

02:47:30.820 --> 02:47:35.820
I want to see you wrap yourself round and choke somebody.

02:47:35.820 --> 02:47:37.820
I know. How about the tiger?

02:47:37.820 --> 02:47:38.820
He do.

02:47:38.820 --> 02:47:39.820
I'd rather not.

02:47:39.820 --> 02:47:41.820
We became friends in the zoo.

02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:44.820
Oh, I know.

02:47:44.820 --> 02:47:46.820
Choke stinky. That'll be much better.

02:47:46.820 --> 02:47:49.820
Yes, my dewey did let us out of the zoo.

02:47:52.820 --> 02:47:54.820
Well, you're a great disappointment to me.

02:47:54.820 --> 02:47:56.820
I let you out because I thought you'd attack the movements,

02:47:56.820 --> 02:47:58.820
but you have tea with them instead.

02:47:58.820 --> 02:48:00.820
You're pathetic, you know that?

02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:02.820
I'm sorry, but we were brought up in captivity,

02:48:02.820 --> 02:48:04.820
and we never had to hunt for our food.

02:48:04.820 --> 02:48:07.820
All our meals are brought to us, you see.

02:48:07.820 --> 02:48:10.820
But your tigers, what do you eat them?

02:48:10.820 --> 02:48:13.820
Well, we love cat food.

02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:14.820
Cat food.

02:48:14.820 --> 02:48:17.820
Oh, I don't believe it.

02:48:17.820 --> 02:48:21.820
Yes, it's easy to chew and it leaves our fur all sleep and shiny.

02:48:21.820 --> 02:48:24.820
We like the yellow tins with the black cat, don't we, honey?

02:48:24.820 --> 02:48:25.820
Yes, it's our favorite.

02:48:25.820 --> 02:48:28.820
You wouldn't happen to have any on you, would you?

02:48:38.820 --> 02:48:39.820
Mama!

02:48:39.820 --> 02:48:41.820
Papa, quickly!

02:48:42.820 --> 02:48:43.820
They're here.

02:48:43.820 --> 02:48:44.820
The zoo men are here.

02:48:44.820 --> 02:48:48.820
Oh, get all the animals into the house first, you.

02:48:48.820 --> 02:48:50.820
Hurry, moment.

02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:51.820
Okay, Papa.

02:48:54.820 --> 02:48:57.820
The zoo men have come to get you.

02:48:57.820 --> 02:48:58.820
Oh, I know.

02:48:58.820 --> 02:48:59.820
I know.

02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:00.820
I know.

02:49:00.820 --> 02:49:01.820
I know.

02:49:01.820 --> 02:49:02.820
I know.

02:49:02.820 --> 02:49:03.820
I know.

02:49:03.820 --> 02:49:04.820
I know.

02:49:05.820 --> 02:49:07.820
The zoo men have come to get you.

02:49:07.820 --> 02:49:10.820
Hurry, you'll be safe in the moment house.

02:49:10.820 --> 02:49:12.820
Quick as you can, Rhino.

02:49:12.820 --> 02:49:13.820
Into the house.

02:49:13.820 --> 02:49:14.820
Go on.

02:49:19.820 --> 02:49:21.820
Now, Rhino, push him.

02:49:21.820 --> 02:49:22.820
I'm sorry.

02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:40.820
Um, I don't think that's a good place to hide, Mrs. Snake.

02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:46.820
I'm afraid that doesn't look quite right, Tiger.

02:49:46.820 --> 02:49:49.820
I thought I might just look like a thick rug.

02:49:49.820 --> 02:49:52.820
I'll just lie here like a beautiful porcelain ornament.

02:49:52.820 --> 02:49:55.820
They'll never know we're here, darling.

02:49:55.820 --> 02:49:59.820
Well, they'd never expect to find a Rhino under there.

02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:00.820
That's what I thought.

02:50:00.820 --> 02:50:01.820
Where are they?

02:50:02.820 --> 02:50:03.820
Well, where are they?

02:50:03.820 --> 02:50:06.820
They can't just have vanished into thin air.

02:50:08.820 --> 02:50:09.820
Hmm.

02:50:09.820 --> 02:50:10.820
Look, up there.

02:50:12.820 --> 02:50:13.820
In the chimney.

02:50:18.820 --> 02:50:20.820
So they're in there, are they?

02:50:32.820 --> 02:50:33.820
Papa!

02:50:35.820 --> 02:50:36.820
They've seen the snake.

02:50:36.820 --> 02:50:37.820
They're nearly here.

02:50:40.820 --> 02:50:43.820
Now, I want you to calm down and be quiet, everyone.

02:50:43.820 --> 02:50:45.820
We won't let them take you away.

02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:48.820
I promise you they'll have a fight on the ends if they try.

02:50:48.820 --> 02:50:50.820
Teeth, please, my father.

02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:51.820
Of course, dear.

02:51:02.820 --> 02:51:03.820
Hello.

02:51:05.820 --> 02:51:06.820
Hello.

02:51:08.820 --> 02:51:09.820
Hello.

02:51:09.820 --> 02:51:10.820
Hello.

02:51:17.820 --> 02:51:19.820
Hello, having a picnic, are you?

02:51:19.820 --> 02:51:20.820
It's lovely day for you.

02:51:20.820 --> 02:51:21.820
Not at all.

02:51:21.820 --> 02:51:23.820
We're all here from the zoo, sir.

02:51:23.820 --> 02:51:25.820
Oh, are you on some sort of expedition?

02:51:25.820 --> 02:51:28.820
Excuse me, but are you the owner of this house?

02:51:28.820 --> 02:51:29.820
Yes, indeed.

02:51:29.820 --> 02:51:30.820
I am.

02:51:30.820 --> 02:51:31.820
I'm moving, Papa.

02:51:31.820 --> 02:51:32.820
Well, what can I do for you?

02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:35.820
Well, you could send out the animals hiding in your house.

02:51:35.820 --> 02:51:37.820
That'll do for a start.

02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:38.820
Animals?

02:51:38.820 --> 02:51:39.820
Oh, no.

02:51:39.820 --> 02:51:42.820
We have firm believers that they belong outside.

02:51:42.820 --> 02:51:46.820
Sir, you can't see from where you are, but I can assure you that there is a python

02:51:46.820 --> 02:51:48.820
sticking its head out of your chimney.

02:51:48.820 --> 02:51:49.820
A python?

02:51:49.820 --> 02:51:51.820
Yes, that's right.

02:51:51.820 --> 02:51:53.820
No, it isn't.

02:51:53.820 --> 02:51:54.820
It isn't.

02:51:54.820 --> 02:51:56.820
No, it's my daughter.

02:51:56.820 --> 02:51:58.820
She happens to look like a python.

02:51:58.820 --> 02:52:00.820
Not all the time you understand.

02:52:00.820 --> 02:52:01.820
Right.

02:52:01.820 --> 02:52:02.820
Come on, man.

02:52:02.820 --> 02:52:04.820
We'll go and get the zoo's property.

02:52:04.820 --> 02:52:07.820
No, you will not enter my house.

02:52:07.820 --> 02:52:08.820
All right.

02:52:08.820 --> 02:52:09.820
Well, you let the animals out.

02:52:09.820 --> 02:52:10.820
We won't have to.

02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:11.820
It's up to you, sir.

02:52:11.820 --> 02:52:14.820
There are no animals, and you won't enter my house.

02:52:14.820 --> 02:52:15.820
Now, wait a minute.

02:52:15.820 --> 02:52:16.820
I do believe, yes.

02:52:16.820 --> 02:52:19.820
You're one of those hippos, aren't you?

02:52:19.820 --> 02:52:20.820
I am not.

02:52:20.820 --> 02:52:21.820
I'm moving, Papa.

02:52:21.820 --> 02:52:23.820
And I am the owner of this house.

02:52:23.820 --> 02:52:24.820
No, you're not.

02:52:24.820 --> 02:52:25.820
You're a hippopotamus.

02:52:25.820 --> 02:52:26.820
Yeah.

02:52:26.820 --> 02:52:28.820
A hippo who owns a house.

02:52:28.820 --> 02:52:30.820
And it's also running in an illegal zoo.

02:52:30.820 --> 02:52:31.820
Break down the doors.

02:52:31.820 --> 02:52:32.820
Huh.

02:52:32.820 --> 02:52:34.820
That is against the law.

02:52:34.820 --> 02:52:35.820
Oh, it is, isn't it?

02:52:35.820 --> 02:52:37.820
Well, there's a nice cage winning for you as well.

02:52:37.820 --> 02:52:39.820
A woman, Papa, hippo.

02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:41.820
I warn you, if you touch that door,

02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:42.820
you'll regret it.

02:52:42.820 --> 02:52:43.820
Go, yeah?

02:52:45.820 --> 02:52:46.820
Great boys.

02:52:46.820 --> 02:52:47.820
Let's go in.

02:52:47.820 --> 02:52:48.820
Charge.

02:52:48.820 --> 02:52:49.820
Charge.

02:52:49.820 --> 02:52:50.820
Charge!

02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:12.820
hall.

02:53:12.820 --> 02:53:14.820
Now, then, what's going on?

02:53:14.820 --> 02:53:17.820
Little mice brought the inspector.

02:53:17.820 --> 02:53:19.820
What do you mean that you're doing?

02:53:19.820 --> 02:53:22.700
Ah, they're hiding animals from the zoo in this house.

02:53:22.700 --> 02:53:23.700
We want them back.

02:53:23.700 --> 02:53:26.460
I tried to reason with the hippo, but it was no good.

02:53:26.460 --> 02:53:30.460
Oh, have you know that's willful destruction of property, my good man?

02:53:30.460 --> 02:53:32.460
It's not willful, we're from the zoo.

02:53:32.460 --> 02:53:33.860
We gotta get in somehow.

02:53:33.860 --> 02:53:37.860
Oh, have you, and can you be sure that there are zoo animals in there?

02:53:38.860 --> 02:53:40.860
You just take a look up there at the chimney.

02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:42.180
That's all I'm sure.

02:53:42.180 --> 02:53:43.180
Go on.

02:53:45.060 --> 02:53:47.060
See that python's head sticking out?

02:53:48.340 --> 02:53:49.260
That's on.

02:53:49.260 --> 02:53:51.260
I can't see a python's head.

02:53:51.260 --> 02:53:53.780
But there was a python's head up there, I saw it.

02:53:55.580 --> 02:53:56.580
I can't breathe.

02:53:58.580 --> 02:54:00.580
Now you listen to me, zoo man.

02:54:01.580 --> 02:54:04.620
Either you stop bothering my friends or I'll arrest you.

02:54:04.620 --> 02:54:05.460
Is that clear?

02:54:05.460 --> 02:54:06.740
Well, is it?

02:54:06.740 --> 02:54:07.740
Yes, sir, it is.

02:54:07.740 --> 02:54:09.980
But what about the zoo animals?

02:54:09.980 --> 02:54:12.460
You heard the inspector now go away.

02:54:12.460 --> 02:54:13.300
Do you see that?

02:54:13.300 --> 02:54:14.100
See what?

02:54:14.100 --> 02:54:14.980
The hippopotamus.

02:54:14.980 --> 02:54:15.740
What?

02:54:15.740 --> 02:54:16.740
The hippopotamus.

02:54:16.740 --> 02:54:19.100
He's a fellow's been hiding all our zoo animals.

02:54:19.100 --> 02:54:21.540
We got a nice cage lined up for him as well, inspector.

02:54:21.540 --> 02:54:23.500
Oh, so that's your plan, isn't it?

02:54:23.500 --> 02:54:25.220
Ha, they want to take them all.

02:54:25.220 --> 02:54:28.140
Moomin, snork, me, mama, and papa.

02:54:28.140 --> 02:54:30.060
Hmm, the criminal conspiracy.

02:54:30.060 --> 02:54:31.140
Conspiracy?

02:54:31.140 --> 02:54:33.620
It would probably be called kidnapping.

02:54:33.620 --> 02:54:35.660
Once you can't kidnap a hippo.

02:54:35.660 --> 02:54:37.660
That's a movement.

02:54:37.660 --> 02:54:39.580
It could be white slavery, though.

02:54:39.580 --> 02:54:43.220
I'm sure I could add incitement to riot to the list.

02:54:43.220 --> 02:54:45.380
Now I hate paperwork, so I'll tell you one.

02:54:45.420 --> 02:54:47.900
If you're gone within 10 minutes, I won't arrest you.

02:54:47.900 --> 02:54:50.460
Why don't you put them in the deepest dungeon, inspector?

02:54:50.460 --> 02:54:52.820
The one with all the rats and spiders and scorpions

02:54:52.820 --> 02:54:55.100
that'll teach them to put Moomin's encages.

02:54:55.100 --> 02:54:56.820
That's a good idea, little mind.

02:54:56.820 --> 02:54:59.260
They like animals.

02:54:59.260 --> 02:55:01.780
I'll start counting now.

02:55:01.780 --> 02:55:05.020
One, two, three.

02:55:05.020 --> 02:55:08.460
Get around men quickly.

02:55:08.460 --> 02:55:10.140
We'll have to think quickly on this one, men.

02:55:10.140 --> 02:55:12.780
Come on, now, does anybody have any smart ideas?

02:55:12.780 --> 02:55:14.460
Come on, we're running out of time.

02:55:16.380 --> 02:55:17.660
One minute.

02:55:17.660 --> 02:55:19.980
Look, guys, we're going to figure something out right now.

02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:20.820
Ready and look.

02:55:20.820 --> 02:55:24.060
One minute, 30 seconds.

02:55:24.060 --> 02:55:25.060
Two minutes.

02:55:25.060 --> 02:55:26.900
Three minutes, 30 seconds.

02:55:26.900 --> 02:55:28.100
Look, leave us alone.

02:55:28.100 --> 02:55:29.420
Way of work and faring.

02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:32.220
All right, six minutes and 50 seconds.

02:55:32.220 --> 02:55:33.260
Time's up.

02:55:33.260 --> 02:55:34.300
You're cheating.

02:55:34.300 --> 02:55:38.180
The police don't cheat, and now you've got nine minutes

02:55:38.180 --> 02:55:39.700
and 30 seconds.

02:55:39.700 --> 02:55:40.740
How about that?

02:55:40.740 --> 02:55:42.100
Nine minutes, 50 bucks?

02:55:42.100 --> 02:55:43.060
I give up.

02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:44.500
Everybody beat it.

02:55:44.500 --> 02:55:46.100
But we're still discussing it.

02:55:46.100 --> 02:55:46.700
No, we're not.

02:55:46.700 --> 02:55:48.100
We're getting out.

02:55:48.100 --> 02:55:48.940
Look, everyone.

02:55:48.940 --> 02:55:52.220
The zoom in, and we're running off.

02:55:52.220 --> 02:55:53.340
Great.

02:55:53.340 --> 02:55:55.460
You've got to come and see this, Mama.

02:55:55.460 --> 02:55:58.060
Nine minutes and 50 and a half seconds.

02:55:58.060 --> 02:55:59.140
And don't come back.

02:55:59.140 --> 02:56:00.860
We'll be the dungeon for you.

02:56:00.860 --> 02:56:03.460
And I make that 10 minutes up to you.

02:56:03.460 --> 02:56:05.060
You saved this little mind.

02:56:05.060 --> 02:56:07.540
It was really clever of you to fetch the inspector.

02:56:07.540 --> 02:56:10.340
Well, there were too many of them for me to fight.

02:56:10.340 --> 02:56:11.020
OK?

02:56:11.020 --> 02:56:12.940
Everyone, come on now.

02:56:15.460 --> 02:56:19.220
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

02:56:19.220 --> 02:56:21.180
And so everyone was saved.

02:56:21.180 --> 02:56:23.180
And eventually, they all came out of the house

02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:25.620
to go and have fun in the jungle again.

02:56:25.620 --> 02:56:27.220
As long as the warm weather lasted,

02:56:27.220 --> 02:56:28.660
there were plenty of things to do.

02:56:28.660 --> 02:56:31.460
But one day, the weather changed.

02:56:31.460 --> 02:56:33.620
And cold winds blew down Mumen Valley.

02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:39.300
It feels like autumn has arrived.

02:56:39.300 --> 02:56:41.500
The jungle won't like the cold weather.

02:56:41.500 --> 02:56:44.140
Do you think it will die, Mama?

02:56:44.140 --> 02:56:45.940
I'm afraid it will, little mind.

02:56:45.940 --> 02:56:47.380
It grew very quickly.

02:56:47.380 --> 02:56:51.420
So perhaps it will go the same way.

02:56:51.420 --> 02:56:52.660
And it did.

02:56:52.660 --> 02:56:56.060
The whole jungle with it and died in just one night.

02:57:02.300 --> 02:57:04.340
I think I've done a cold coming, Mama.

02:57:04.340 --> 02:57:05.180
I'm sorry.

02:57:05.180 --> 02:57:06.820
I can't get the house any hotter.

02:57:06.820 --> 02:57:07.820
I missed the zoo.

02:57:07.820 --> 02:57:09.340
At least it was warm now.

02:57:09.340 --> 02:57:11.740
Yes, this cold is awful.

02:57:11.740 --> 02:57:14.180
It would warm them up if we weren't the dead jungle.

02:57:31.260 --> 02:57:32.460
Now they're happy again.

02:57:32.460 --> 02:57:33.460
But for how long?

02:57:41.740 --> 02:57:48.740
Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys.

02:57:48.740 --> 02:57:49.740
It's cold again.

02:57:49.740 --> 02:57:51.740
It was warm in our cages.

02:57:51.740 --> 02:57:53.740
What are you afraid here?

02:57:53.740 --> 02:57:55.740
Yes, free to have pneumonia.

02:57:55.740 --> 02:58:00.740
I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spending the winter here.

02:58:00.740 --> 02:58:02.740
And so all the animals,

02:58:02.740 --> 02:58:04.740
decided to return to the zoo.

02:58:04.740 --> 02:58:08.740
Perhaps we'll let you come back next summer, Mrs. Snake?

02:58:08.740 --> 02:58:09.740
I like that.

02:58:09.740 --> 02:58:10.740
When it's warmer.

02:58:14.740 --> 02:58:17.740
Hey, look, the animals are on their way back.

02:58:17.740 --> 02:58:19.740
Oh, Ray!

02:58:19.740 --> 02:58:20.740
That wonderful.

02:58:20.740 --> 02:58:22.740
Oh, it's good to see you.

02:58:22.740 --> 02:58:23.740
You're welcome.

02:58:23.740 --> 02:58:24.740
I'm so excited.

02:58:24.740 --> 02:58:25.740
I'm so excited.

02:58:25.740 --> 02:58:26.740
I'm so excited.

02:58:26.740 --> 02:58:27.740
I'm so excited.

02:58:27.740 --> 02:58:28.740
I'm so excited.

02:58:28.740 --> 02:58:29.740
I'm so excited.

02:58:29.740 --> 02:58:30.740
I'm so excited.

02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:32.740
Oh, it's good to see you.

02:58:32.740 --> 02:58:34.740
You don't know how much we missed you.

02:58:34.740 --> 02:58:35.740
Oh, good.

02:58:35.740 --> 02:58:36.740
Gosh.

02:58:36.740 --> 02:58:38.740
We'll come back right now, old fella.

02:58:38.740 --> 02:58:39.740
It's good to see you.

02:58:39.740 --> 02:58:40.740
Come on now.

02:58:40.740 --> 02:58:41.740
Get back to your cages quickly.

02:58:41.740 --> 02:58:43.740
We've been keeping them nice and warm for you.

02:58:43.740 --> 02:58:45.740
Go on, off you go now.

02:58:45.740 --> 02:58:48.740
You look all right, but I'm sure you must all be starving.

02:58:48.740 --> 02:58:51.740
We'll do you a special meal tonight, all right?

02:58:51.740 --> 02:58:53.740
Ah, the hippos, too.

02:58:53.740 --> 02:58:55.740
For the last time, we're moments.

02:58:55.740 --> 02:58:56.740
Not hippos.

02:58:56.740 --> 02:58:57.740
You must be cold as well.

02:58:57.740 --> 02:58:59.740
We'll warm up a cage for you.

02:58:59.740 --> 02:59:00.740
It'll be nice and cozy, there.

02:59:00.740 --> 02:59:01.740
No.

02:59:01.740 --> 02:59:02.740
No.

02:59:02.740 --> 02:59:04.740
It just came to send the animals off.

02:59:04.740 --> 02:59:06.740
Hey, get a cage ready for the hippos.

02:59:06.740 --> 02:59:07.740
Will you?

02:59:07.740 --> 02:59:08.740
Nice and warm.

02:59:08.740 --> 02:59:11.740
At the risk of sounding repetitive, we are moments.

02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:12.740
Don't be ridiculous.

02:59:12.740 --> 02:59:14.740
You're mullet here.

02:59:14.740 --> 02:59:16.740
But we're nothing like hippos.

02:59:16.740 --> 02:59:18.740
We know you're not purebred, but the public

02:59:18.740 --> 02:59:20.740
will never be able to tell.

02:59:20.740 --> 02:59:27.740
Do we have to stay here forever, Papa?

02:59:27.740 --> 02:59:29.740
Of course not, Momen.

02:59:29.740 --> 02:59:31.740
Don't worry. I'll think of something.

02:59:31.740 --> 02:59:32.740
You will, won't you?

02:59:32.740 --> 02:59:34.740
Have you got any ideas?

02:59:34.740 --> 02:59:38.740
Well, not yet, but I am a writer, you know.

02:59:42.740 --> 02:59:44.740
Don't cry, Snorth Maiden.

02:59:44.740 --> 02:59:46.740
I'm sure there won't be only hay to eat.

02:59:46.740 --> 02:59:49.740
I don't mind as long as we're together.

02:59:49.740 --> 02:59:52.740
But what if they put us in separate cages?

02:59:52.740 --> 02:59:53.740
No.

02:59:53.740 --> 02:59:56.740
Well, that would be awful if they wouldn't do that.

02:59:56.740 --> 03:00:00.740
Well, perhaps the inspector will come looking for us.

03:00:00.740 --> 03:00:03.740
When he realizes that we've gone as well as the animals,

03:00:03.740 --> 03:00:06.740
he'll bring the full power of the Lord to bear on them.

03:00:06.740 --> 03:00:08.740
Oh, look, there's someone coming.

03:00:08.740 --> 03:00:09.740
It's Snorth Maiden.

03:00:09.740 --> 03:00:10.740
And Hamilton.

03:00:10.740 --> 03:00:11.740
And a little Mai.

03:00:11.740 --> 03:00:13.740
Snorth Maiden.

03:00:15.740 --> 03:00:16.740
Hi, Moomin.

03:00:17.740 --> 03:00:20.740
Don't worry. We'll have you guys out in just a minute.

03:00:23.740 --> 03:00:24.740
Please come out.

03:00:27.740 --> 03:00:30.740
Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to let you out.

03:00:30.740 --> 03:00:32.740
I'm in charge of this zoo.

03:00:32.740 --> 03:00:34.740
I'm afraid it was quite an understandable mistake.

03:00:34.740 --> 03:00:38.740
But please accept this token of apology from the Board of Trustees.

03:00:38.740 --> 03:00:40.740
Here you are, madam.

03:00:40.740 --> 03:00:43.740
Mr. Hemelon and I went to the Royal Academy of Science

03:00:43.740 --> 03:00:45.740
just to sort all this out.

03:00:45.740 --> 03:00:47.740
We've been given a letter from the President

03:00:47.740 --> 03:00:49.740
stating that you are not hippos.

03:00:49.740 --> 03:00:52.740
Mr. Hemelon's scientific background helped persuade him.

03:00:52.740 --> 03:00:54.740
So you can all come home now.

03:00:55.740 --> 03:00:59.740
Well, it just goes to show you must never judge by appearances alone.

03:01:02.740 --> 03:01:03.740
Mama.

03:01:03.740 --> 03:01:04.740
Yes, Papa.

03:01:04.740 --> 03:01:06.740
Do you think I should grow a beard?

03:01:06.740 --> 03:01:08.740
No, Papa.

03:01:15.740 --> 03:01:18.740
And so autumn came to Moomin Valley.

03:01:18.740 --> 03:01:22.740
A new season with different weather and different pleasures.

03:01:29.740 --> 03:01:36.740
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

03:01:36.740 --> 03:01:43.740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

03:01:43.740 --> 03:01:47.740
They're always happy and always at play.

03:01:47.740 --> 03:01:50.740
The movements are having fun day after day.

03:01:50.740 --> 03:01:54.740
The movements.

03:01:54.740 --> 03:01:58.740
The movements.

03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:05.740
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

03:02:05.740 --> 03:02:12.740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

03:02:12.740 --> 03:02:16.740
They're always happy and always at play.

03:02:16.740 --> 03:02:20.740
The movements are having fun day after day.

03:02:20.740 --> 03:02:24.740
The movements.

03:02:24.740 --> 03:02:27.740
The movements.

03:02:27.740 --> 03:02:34.740
The movements.

03:02:42.740 --> 03:02:53.740
The movements.

03:02:53.740 --> 03:02:56.740
Here they are for one and all.

03:02:56.740 --> 03:02:59.740
The movements are about to come.

03:02:59.740 --> 03:03:02.740
Come on and sit down here with me.

03:03:02.740 --> 03:03:07.740
There for you on your TV they are the movements.

03:03:07.740 --> 03:03:10.740
They are the movements.

03:03:10.740 --> 03:03:13.740
If so come with me give me your hand.

03:03:13.740 --> 03:03:16.740
I'll take you up to Moomin Land.

03:03:16.740 --> 03:03:19.740
You can fly just like a bird.

03:03:19.740 --> 03:03:21.740
Sing that song ever.

03:03:21.740 --> 03:03:24.740
There were the movements.

03:03:24.740 --> 03:03:27.740
There were the movements.

03:03:27.740 --> 03:03:30.740
There were the movements.

03:03:30.740 --> 03:03:33.740
There were the movements.

03:03:33.740 --> 03:03:36.740
There were the movements.

03:03:36.740 --> 03:03:39.740
There were the movements.

03:03:39.740 --> 03:03:42.740
There were the movements.

03:03:42.740 --> 03:03:45.740
There were the movements.

03:03:45.740 --> 03:03:48.740
There were the movements.

03:03:48.740 --> 03:03:51.740
There were the movements.

03:03:51.740 --> 03:03:54.740
There were the movements.

03:03:54.740 --> 03:03:57.740
There were the movements.

03:03:57.740 --> 03:04:01.740
There were the movements.

03:04:01.740 --> 03:04:05.740
There were the movements.

03:04:05.740 --> 03:04:14.740
There were the movements.

03:04:14.740 --> 03:04:22.740
Fall has come to Moomin Valley and the memory of sunshine filled hours fades as the days become shorter and the nights longer.

03:04:22.740 --> 03:04:28.740
The wind blows away the falling leaves and the blue skies of summer are now gray and cloudy.

03:04:28.740 --> 03:04:32.740
Winter is just around the corner.

03:04:32.740 --> 03:04:38.740
Snork made it.

03:04:38.740 --> 03:04:40.740
Where are you going?

03:04:40.740 --> 03:04:43.740
Oh I'm just taking my brother his lunch little my.

03:04:43.740 --> 03:04:46.740
He must have nearly finished the flying ship by now.

03:04:46.740 --> 03:04:47.740
Oh no.

03:04:47.740 --> 03:04:50.740
Not even snork works that quickly.

03:04:50.740 --> 03:04:52.740
Well have you seen it?

03:04:52.740 --> 03:04:53.740
No I haven't.

03:04:53.740 --> 03:04:55.740
He won't even let me come into his workshop.

03:04:55.740 --> 03:04:58.740
Is he afraid it'll disappear if someone sees it?

03:04:58.740 --> 03:05:02.740
He hasn't said why but I suppose all great inventors have to be very careful.

03:05:02.740 --> 03:05:05.740
Someone might want to steal their ideas.

03:05:05.740 --> 03:05:08.740
Moomin told me he's dying to have a look at it.

03:05:18.740 --> 03:05:20.740
Hey Moomin open the door.

03:05:20.740 --> 03:05:22.740
I've got my hands full.

03:05:22.740 --> 03:05:24.740
Come on quickly.

03:05:24.740 --> 03:05:26.740
Look what I've got.

03:05:26.740 --> 03:05:29.740
It's a 100 player.

03:05:38.740 --> 03:05:40.740
Do you think you can get it working dear?

03:05:40.740 --> 03:05:42.740
Oh yes of course mom.

03:05:42.740 --> 03:05:45.740
Why do people always give me things that are broken.

03:05:45.740 --> 03:05:50.740
It'd be nice to have something that worked for a change.

03:05:50.740 --> 03:05:53.740
Moomin Papa will get it working for you.

03:05:53.740 --> 03:05:56.740
My auntie said that the record was alright though.

03:05:56.740 --> 03:05:57.740
It's dance music.

03:05:57.740 --> 03:05:59.740
She's had it for ages but I've never heard it.

03:05:59.740 --> 03:06:00.740
Oh that's nice.

03:06:00.740 --> 03:06:04.740
It's years since I danced but it seems like only yesterday.

03:06:04.740 --> 03:06:06.740
Do you remember what funny was Papa?

03:06:06.740 --> 03:06:08.740
Dancing.

03:06:08.740 --> 03:06:09.740
Oh yeah.

03:06:09.740 --> 03:06:11.740
I see.

03:06:11.740 --> 03:06:13.740
Have you fixed it Papa?

03:06:14.740 --> 03:06:15.740
Huh?

03:06:15.740 --> 03:06:17.740
I can hear music.

03:06:17.740 --> 03:06:19.740
Doesn't sound like snuffkin.

03:06:44.740 --> 03:06:47.740
Right have you got the idea now?

03:06:47.740 --> 03:06:49.740
Yes I think so.

03:06:49.740 --> 03:06:51.740
Me too.

03:06:51.740 --> 03:06:52.740
Come on.

03:06:52.740 --> 03:06:55.740
Oh let's see you then.

03:06:55.740 --> 03:06:57.740
May I?

03:06:57.740 --> 03:07:01.740
Did I do it?

03:07:01.740 --> 03:07:03.740
Oh wow.

03:07:04.740 --> 03:07:06.740
Look at Papa Moomin.

03:07:06.740 --> 03:07:09.740
He's a great dancer.

03:07:33.740 --> 03:07:35.740
Well then can you dance snuff?

03:07:35.740 --> 03:07:36.740
I've never tried.

03:07:36.740 --> 03:07:39.740
Right well try now.

03:08:04.740 --> 03:08:12.740
Oh that was fun.

03:08:12.740 --> 03:08:15.740
Oh dancing never you still wear me out like this.

03:08:15.740 --> 03:08:18.740
You've got no sense of rhythm at all Sniff.

03:08:18.740 --> 03:08:21.740
I can still dance though can I?

03:08:21.740 --> 03:08:23.740
Oh are you ready Papa?

03:08:23.740 --> 03:08:26.740
I think I'll have to sit this one out Mama.

03:08:26.740 --> 03:08:28.740
Alright.

03:08:29.740 --> 03:08:31.740
Little one.

03:08:31.740 --> 03:08:32.740
No thank you.

03:08:32.740 --> 03:08:33.740
I'll dance on my own.

03:08:33.740 --> 03:08:34.740
Well then.

03:08:34.740 --> 03:08:36.740
Why don't you dance with me and Sniff?

03:08:36.740 --> 03:08:38.740
Ah.

03:08:52.740 --> 03:08:55.740
Oh it looks like it's here for the day.

03:08:59.740 --> 03:09:04.740
Oh what horrible weather Snuffkin.

03:09:04.740 --> 03:09:05.740
Yes.

03:09:05.740 --> 03:09:07.740
They're having fun.

03:09:07.740 --> 03:09:11.740
Well Sniff brought this old record player over and we've been dancing.

03:09:11.740 --> 03:09:13.740
I haven't done it for years and years.

03:09:13.740 --> 03:09:15.740
Well aren't you coming in?

03:09:15.740 --> 03:09:19.740
I can smell winter in the air Moomin Papa.

03:09:19.740 --> 03:09:24.740
Oh yes you're right.

03:09:29.740 --> 03:09:33.740
Sniffkin why?

03:09:38.740 --> 03:09:40.740
Sniffkin come and dance with me.

03:09:40.740 --> 03:09:42.740
No thanks of mine.

03:09:47.740 --> 03:09:49.740
Sorry.

03:09:49.740 --> 03:09:51.740
I'm sorry.

03:09:51.740 --> 03:09:53.740
Oh you.

03:09:59.740 --> 03:10:03.740
Hmm what's the matter with this?

03:10:06.740 --> 03:10:08.740
I'm afraid it's broken.

03:10:08.740 --> 03:10:10.740
Just when we were having so much fun.

03:10:10.740 --> 03:10:12.740
Will you be able to fix it again dear?

03:10:12.740 --> 03:10:14.740
No even I can't mend it now.

03:10:14.740 --> 03:10:17.740
Oh please try Papa will you?

03:10:17.740 --> 03:10:21.740
Snuffkin do you know anything about record players?

03:10:21.740 --> 03:10:23.740
No I'm afraid not.

03:10:23.740 --> 03:10:24.740
Oh dear.

03:10:24.740 --> 03:10:25.740
But what?

03:10:25.740 --> 03:10:29.740
I'll play my harmonic if you want to continue to dance and then you can fiddle around with the machine.

03:10:29.740 --> 03:10:31.740
How would that be?

03:10:31.740 --> 03:10:34.740
Oh yes please that would be great Snuffkin thanks.

03:10:34.740 --> 03:10:37.740
Now then what would be a good tune to dance to?

03:10:37.740 --> 03:10:39.740
Let's see.

03:10:56.740 --> 03:10:59.740
Oh no.

03:11:10.740 --> 03:11:12.740
Now what's this?

03:11:12.740 --> 03:11:16.740
Oh no I give up.

03:11:18.740 --> 03:11:21.740
May I?

03:11:25.740 --> 03:11:28.740
You're thinking about going away again aren't you Snuffkin?

03:11:28.740 --> 03:11:30.740
Hmm.

03:11:30.740 --> 03:11:36.740
I know that you go south every year when winter comes but I'll still miss you though and I wish you could stay here in Moomin Valley.

03:11:36.740 --> 03:11:39.740
I know Moomin.

03:11:40.740 --> 03:11:42.740
Who are they?

03:11:42.740 --> 03:11:45.740
How do you know I expect to be?

03:11:45.740 --> 03:11:46.740
I don't know.

03:11:46.740 --> 03:11:49.740
I'm just a little bit nervous.

03:11:49.740 --> 03:11:52.740
I'm just a little nervous.

03:11:52.740 --> 03:11:57.740
You're thinking about going away again aren't you Snuffkin?

03:11:57.740 --> 03:11:59.740
Hmm.

03:11:59.740 --> 03:12:05.740
I know that you go south every year when winter comes, but I'll still miss you though and I wish you could stay here in Moomin Valley.

03:12:05.740 --> 03:12:08.740
I know Moomin.

03:12:08.740 --> 03:12:10.740
But I don't know I expect.

03:12:10.740 --> 03:12:14.740
Probably the best place for them.

03:12:14.740 --> 03:12:16.740
When are you leaving Snuffkin?

03:12:16.740 --> 03:12:18.740
Oh I haven't decided yet.

03:12:18.740 --> 03:12:22.740
So you'll be here for a bit longer then.

03:12:22.740 --> 03:12:24.740
Do you know where you going?

03:12:24.740 --> 03:12:25.740
No.

03:12:25.740 --> 03:12:27.740
It must be fun traveling.

03:12:27.740 --> 03:12:30.740
Yes most of the time.

03:12:30.740 --> 03:12:33.740
It's the best way of meeting new people and still being on your own.

03:12:33.740 --> 03:12:39.740
I wish we could do that, but even when we hibernate and go to sleep, we're never really alone.

03:12:39.740 --> 03:12:42.740
I guess I'd hibernate too if I had to stay up here in Moomin.

03:12:42.740 --> 03:12:45.740
During all the freezing winter snows.

03:12:50.740 --> 03:12:54.740
Do you think I could go south with Snuffkin, Papa?

03:12:57.740 --> 03:13:01.740
Not really, it's the moment way to hibernate.

03:13:01.740 --> 03:13:06.740
It's a family custom passed down through the years by our ancestors.

03:13:06.740 --> 03:13:09.740
But Papa, I don't want to go to sleep for months on end.

03:13:09.740 --> 03:13:11.740
I want to travel south with Snuffkin.

03:13:11.740 --> 03:13:13.740
Oh Moomin.

03:13:13.740 --> 03:13:16.740
You promise you'll be back on the first day of spring.

03:13:16.740 --> 03:13:17.740
Oh Mama.

03:13:17.740 --> 03:13:20.740
Does that mean I can really go?

03:13:20.740 --> 03:13:22.740
I can't wait to tell Snuffkin.

03:13:22.740 --> 03:13:24.740
I can, can't I?

03:13:24.740 --> 03:13:27.740
Well if you really want to, I don't suppose we'll stop you.

03:13:27.740 --> 03:13:29.740
Will we Papa?

03:13:29.740 --> 03:13:35.740
Now my parents didn't mind when I traveled around in my youth, so yes or right Moomin.

03:13:35.740 --> 03:13:39.740
Oh thank you Mama, thank you Mama.

03:13:39.740 --> 03:13:43.740
That's great, but what will Snuffkin say?

03:13:49.740 --> 03:13:54.740
Well, it's a good idea, and I gotta say it'd be fun to have you a long Moomin.

03:13:54.740 --> 03:13:57.740
So I can come with you Snuffkin?

03:13:58.740 --> 03:13:59.740
No.

03:13:59.740 --> 03:14:00.740
What?

03:14:00.740 --> 03:14:03.740
I'm sorry, but I've got to go on my own.

03:14:03.740 --> 03:14:06.740
Don't be disappointed Moomin, I told you I travel alone.

03:14:06.740 --> 03:14:07.740
I need to.

03:14:07.740 --> 03:14:12.740
After spending the rest of the year here, just as I need to be here, after spending the winter alone.

03:14:12.740 --> 03:14:15.740
And the joy of returning to Moomin Valley is something I wouldn't miss.

03:14:15.740 --> 03:14:17.740
Which Snuffkin, I thought.

03:14:17.740 --> 03:14:21.740
The time will soon pass, and you'll be asleep through most of it.

03:14:21.740 --> 03:14:23.740
You won't notice I'm not here.

03:14:23.740 --> 03:14:26.740
I'll see you next spring, Moomin.

03:14:26.740 --> 03:14:31.740
I'll be back on the first day as usual, I promise, as soon as the weather warns.

03:14:31.740 --> 03:14:35.740
And when the flowers start to grow, nothing will keep me from Moomin Valley.

03:14:36.740 --> 03:14:40.740
I'll be back on the first day.

03:14:40.740 --> 03:14:44.740
I'm sorry, I didn't work out for you, Moomin.

03:14:44.740 --> 03:14:47.740
Oh, it's all right.

03:14:47.740 --> 03:14:52.740
Oh, come on Moomin, you'll have to tie them a bit tighter than that.

03:14:52.740 --> 03:14:56.740
I'm sorry I didn't work out for you, Moomin.

03:14:56.740 --> 03:14:58.740
Oh, it's all right.

03:14:58.740 --> 03:15:04.740
Oh, come on, Mum, and you'll have to tie them a bit tighter than that.

03:15:07.740 --> 03:15:12.740
It'll be a cold winter, so we'll need lots of wood to keep us going till spring comes.

03:15:12.740 --> 03:15:13.740
I know.

03:15:13.740 --> 03:15:16.740
Now you want to stay warm, don't you?

03:15:16.740 --> 03:15:19.740
When I grow up, I'll go south for my own, too.

03:15:19.740 --> 03:15:22.740
Yes, of course you will.

03:15:28.740 --> 03:15:32.740
It's Mum and home.

03:15:32.740 --> 03:15:34.740
Yes.

03:15:34.740 --> 03:15:37.740
How is he? Is he still down in the dumps?

03:15:37.740 --> 03:15:41.740
I'm afraid so, grandma's cheer you up recipe didn't work.

03:15:41.740 --> 03:15:45.740
I think he's being silly just because Snuffkin's going away.

03:15:45.740 --> 03:15:47.740
I suppose he is.

03:15:47.740 --> 03:15:49.740
But don't worry, Mama.

03:15:49.740 --> 03:15:54.740
He won't be miserable much longer because I got a surprise for him.

03:16:20.740 --> 03:16:22.740
Are you there, Mum?

03:16:22.740 --> 03:16:24.740
Oh, Mum, and don't cry.

03:16:24.740 --> 03:16:26.740
Boys don't cry, I suppose.

03:16:26.740 --> 03:16:27.740
Of course they do.

03:16:27.740 --> 03:16:29.740
Well, I'm not crying, so they're...

03:16:29.740 --> 03:16:32.740
All right, but I do think you should get up now.

03:16:32.740 --> 03:16:34.740
Oh, and why should I?

03:16:34.740 --> 03:16:36.740
I have a surprise for you.

03:16:36.740 --> 03:16:37.740
I don't want any surprises.

03:16:37.740 --> 03:16:40.740
Come on, I'm going to go and see Snuffkin his workshop.

03:16:40.740 --> 03:16:44.740
But you know he won't let us in. I've tried before.

03:16:44.740 --> 03:16:46.740
Oh, yes. He will today.

03:16:46.740 --> 03:16:48.740
I promise.

03:16:48.740 --> 03:16:51.740
What? You mean Snorkel shows his flying ship at last?

03:16:51.740 --> 03:16:53.740
Yes, he said.

03:16:53.740 --> 03:16:55.740
Has he really finished it then?

03:16:55.740 --> 03:16:58.740
No, not yet. There's still a lot of work to do on it.

03:16:58.740 --> 03:17:00.740
Then I wonder why he's letting us see it.

03:17:00.740 --> 03:17:02.740
He's always refused before.

03:17:02.740 --> 03:17:04.740
What's made him change his mind?

03:17:04.740 --> 03:17:06.740
But I asked him this time.

03:17:06.740 --> 03:17:09.740
I said I wanted to show it to you. It just needed a woman's touch.

03:17:09.740 --> 03:17:11.740
What did you say to him?

03:17:11.740 --> 03:17:13.740
First, he said absolutely not.

03:17:13.740 --> 03:17:17.740
But when I told him how ill you were and that you probably wouldn't be with us much longer,

03:17:17.740 --> 03:17:19.740
he gave in and said we could see it.

03:17:19.740 --> 03:17:20.740
Just you and me of course.

03:17:20.740 --> 03:17:22.740
I'm not that ill Snorkel maiden.

03:17:22.740 --> 03:17:23.740
Oh good.

03:17:23.740 --> 03:17:26.740
Because sometimes when people are very depressed and just lying bad,

03:17:26.740 --> 03:17:28.740
they've done something bad.

03:17:28.740 --> 03:17:31.740
Oh stop it Snorkel maiden. Don't say things like that.

03:17:34.740 --> 03:17:36.740
I'm only trying to cheer you up.

03:17:36.740 --> 03:17:38.740
So remember, don't tell us all.

03:17:38.740 --> 03:17:41.740
No one else must know anything about it.

03:17:41.740 --> 03:17:42.740
Okay.

03:17:48.740 --> 03:17:50.740
Let's go.

03:18:03.740 --> 03:18:04.740
No.

03:18:07.740 --> 03:18:08.740
A little my.

03:18:08.740 --> 03:18:09.740
Little my.

03:18:09.740 --> 03:18:10.740
Trouble.

03:18:10.740 --> 03:18:11.740
Big Trouble.

03:18:11.740 --> 03:18:12.740
We must fool her.

03:18:12.740 --> 03:18:13.740
Yes, but how?

03:18:13.740 --> 03:18:14.740
What can we do?

03:18:15.740 --> 03:18:16.740
I know what we'll do.

03:18:17.740 --> 03:18:18.740
What?

03:18:18.740 --> 03:18:19.740
Quick, Moonman.

03:18:19.740 --> 03:18:21.740
You just agree with everything I say Snorkel maiden.

03:18:21.740 --> 03:18:22.740
Oh.

03:18:23.740 --> 03:18:25.740
I thought you were in bad Moonman.

03:18:25.740 --> 03:18:27.740
No, we're going to see Snorkel.

03:18:27.740 --> 03:18:28.740
Yes.

03:18:28.740 --> 03:18:29.740
Really?

03:18:29.740 --> 03:18:31.740
Yes, he needs to clear a runway for when the flying ship is finished.

03:18:31.740 --> 03:18:33.740
We're going to help him do it, that's all.

03:18:33.740 --> 03:18:34.740
Yes.

03:18:34.740 --> 03:18:35.740
Are you really, Moonman?

03:18:35.740 --> 03:18:37.740
You got out of bad to do that.

03:18:37.740 --> 03:18:44.740
I'm afraid I find it very strange that Snorkel's asked to go along and help him cut down bushes and dig up roots and things.

03:18:44.740 --> 03:18:46.740
You might have noticed I'm not a complete fool.

03:18:46.740 --> 03:18:47.740
But it's true, little my.

03:18:47.740 --> 03:18:48.740
Oh, yes.

03:18:48.740 --> 03:18:50.740
Well, at least you could have invented a better lie.

03:18:50.740 --> 03:18:55.740
You must think I'm pretty stupid to believe a pathetic story like that.

03:18:55.740 --> 03:18:56.740
But it's the truth.

03:18:56.740 --> 03:18:58.740
And we need your help.

03:18:58.740 --> 03:18:59.740
Yeah.

03:18:59.740 --> 03:19:00.740
Don't bother, don't bother.

03:19:00.740 --> 03:19:01.740
I don't want to hear anymore.

03:19:01.740 --> 03:19:04.740
I think it's very sad that you have to pretend.

03:19:04.740 --> 03:19:09.740
You're trying to hide something from me and I'm not interested in what sort of sneaky underhanded thing it is.

03:19:09.740 --> 03:19:10.740
But little my.

03:19:10.740 --> 03:19:11.740
No buts.

03:19:11.740 --> 03:19:15.740
And anyway, I'm a little too busy at the moment to take any notice of what's going on.

03:19:15.740 --> 03:19:16.740
Goodbye.

03:19:19.740 --> 03:19:20.740
Come on.

03:19:21.740 --> 03:19:22.740
Phew, that was close.

03:19:22.740 --> 03:19:23.740
Yeah.

03:19:30.740 --> 03:19:31.740
Ha!

03:19:31.740 --> 03:19:32.740
Think, thank you.

03:19:32.740 --> 03:19:33.740
Keep a secret from me, do they?

03:19:42.740 --> 03:19:44.740
Are you alone?

03:19:44.740 --> 03:19:45.740
Of course we are.

03:19:45.740 --> 03:19:47.740
I promised, didn't I?

03:19:48.740 --> 03:19:49.740
Come in then.

03:19:57.740 --> 03:19:58.740
Wow.

03:20:05.740 --> 03:20:07.740
It's nearly ready, isn't it?

03:20:07.740 --> 03:20:09.740
Oh no, there's a lot more to do.

03:20:09.740 --> 03:20:11.740
The machine isn't half finished yet.

03:20:11.740 --> 03:20:16.740
And as you can see, there's a lot to do on the ship itself, but I'm getting there slowly.

03:20:18.740 --> 03:20:21.740
I never thought it would be so fantastic, smork.

03:20:22.740 --> 03:20:26.740
Well, I suppose you could say the design wasn't a complete failure.

03:20:27.740 --> 03:20:30.740
I'm quite sure it'll fly beautifully.

03:20:30.740 --> 03:20:31.740
Oh, thank you.

03:20:31.740 --> 03:20:33.740
Do you really think it will, woman?

03:20:34.740 --> 03:20:35.740
I can see it now.

03:20:35.740 --> 03:20:39.740
High up in the air, dodging in and out of the clouds, way up above the world.

03:20:41.740 --> 03:20:44.740
Well, I'm glad to see that you're so perceptive and quite right.

03:20:44.740 --> 03:20:46.740
Oh, how very thoughtful of me.

03:20:46.740 --> 03:20:48.740
Shouldn't you sit down and rest.

03:20:48.740 --> 03:20:49.740
You know, you're illness.

03:20:49.740 --> 03:20:51.740
It doesn't help to get too excited.

03:20:52.740 --> 03:20:53.740
Ha, I shouldn't worry, smork.

03:20:53.740 --> 03:20:55.740
There's nothing wrong with him.

03:20:57.740 --> 03:20:59.740
Oh, little my, how did you get in here?

03:21:00.740 --> 03:21:01.740
Throw that door.

03:21:01.740 --> 03:21:03.740
But I always keep it.

03:21:03.740 --> 03:21:05.740
Oh, oh, oh, no.

03:21:06.740 --> 03:21:08.740
I must have forgotten to lock it.

03:21:09.740 --> 03:21:11.740
And it's a bit late to do it now, isn't it?

03:21:11.740 --> 03:21:15.740
But don't worry, if I wanted to get in, I'd get in locks or no locks.

03:21:15.740 --> 03:21:17.740
Oh, you lied to us, little my.

03:21:17.740 --> 03:21:20.740
Of course, but so did you, telling me that stupid story.

03:21:20.740 --> 03:21:22.740
Now we're even, right?

03:21:22.740 --> 03:21:24.740
Now, listen, little my.

03:21:24.740 --> 03:21:27.740
Don't ever tell anybody what you see over here.

03:21:27.740 --> 03:21:28.740
All right.

03:21:31.740 --> 03:21:34.740
This invention contains so many outstanding new features

03:21:34.740 --> 03:21:36.740
it is difficult to know where to begin.

03:21:38.740 --> 03:21:42.740
But let me start with the most exciting part of the whole construction.

03:21:47.740 --> 03:21:52.740
It began as a dream or rather the concept of a dream

03:21:52.740 --> 03:21:57.740
thrilling, beautiful, impossible, dangerous.

03:22:09.740 --> 03:22:10.740
Oh.

03:22:23.740 --> 03:22:25.740
Can you take the ship down, movement?

03:22:25.740 --> 03:22:27.740
I'd like you to land at that side of the lake.

03:22:27.740 --> 03:22:29.740
Oh, why do you want to get off?

03:22:29.740 --> 03:22:32.740
Aren't you having fun flying about up here?

03:22:33.740 --> 03:22:35.740
I want to be on my own.

03:22:35.740 --> 03:22:37.740
Oh, please stay here.

03:22:37.740 --> 03:22:38.740
If you want.

03:22:38.740 --> 03:22:40.740
No, really, movement, please.

03:22:40.740 --> 03:22:42.740
Bye now.

03:22:42.740 --> 03:22:43.740
No!

03:22:47.740 --> 03:22:49.740
Snuff me!

03:22:53.740 --> 03:22:54.740
Ugh.

03:22:54.740 --> 03:22:57.740
Oh, oh.

03:23:08.740 --> 03:23:10.740
So long then, movement, my friend.

03:23:10.740 --> 03:23:12.740
I'll see you again next year.

03:23:12.740 --> 03:23:14.740
The first day of spring.

03:23:38.740 --> 03:23:40.740
Goodbye, then, Snuffkin.

03:24:01.740 --> 03:24:03.740
Off for the winter, eh, Snuffkin?

03:24:03.740 --> 03:24:04.740
Yes.

03:24:04.740 --> 03:24:06.740
Goodbye, Mr. Hemilan.

03:24:06.740 --> 03:24:08.740
We'll be seeing you in the spring.

03:24:08.740 --> 03:24:11.740
Yes, when the snows are gone.

03:24:17.740 --> 03:24:21.740
Oh, to be young and follow the sun wherever it goes.

03:24:21.740 --> 03:24:22.740
Oh.

03:24:34.740 --> 03:24:38.740
And so the snow fell and winter came to movement valley.

03:24:38.740 --> 03:24:43.740
And in movement's hearts, Snuffkin and the spring seemed a long, long way away.

03:24:44.740 --> 03:24:53.740
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

03:24:53.740 --> 03:25:00.740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

03:25:00.740 --> 03:25:04.740
They're always happy and always at play.

03:25:04.740 --> 03:25:11.740
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

03:25:11.740 --> 03:25:18.740
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

03:25:18.740 --> 03:25:26.740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

03:25:26.740 --> 03:25:31.740
They're always happy and always at play.

03:25:31.740 --> 03:25:37.740
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

03:25:37.740 --> 03:25:44.740
The movements, the movements.

03:25:44.740 --> 03:25:51.740
The movements.

03:26:08.740 --> 03:26:12.740
Here they are for one and all.

03:26:12.740 --> 03:26:15.740
The movements are about to come.

03:26:15.740 --> 03:26:18.740
Come on and sit down here with me.

03:26:18.740 --> 03:26:20.740
They're here for you on your TV.

03:26:20.740 --> 03:26:23.740
They are the movements.

03:26:23.740 --> 03:26:26.740
They are the movements.

03:26:26.740 --> 03:26:29.740
So come with me, give me your hand.

03:26:29.740 --> 03:26:32.740
I'll take you up to a movement land.

03:26:32.740 --> 03:26:35.740
You can fly just like a bird.

03:26:36.740 --> 03:26:38.740
Sing that song ever.

03:26:38.740 --> 03:26:41.740
There were the movements.

03:26:41.740 --> 03:26:44.740
There were the movements.

03:26:44.740 --> 03:26:47.740
There were the movements.

03:26:47.740 --> 03:26:50.740
There were the movements.

03:26:50.740 --> 03:26:53.740
There were the movements.

03:26:53.740 --> 03:26:56.740
There were the movements.

03:27:05.740 --> 03:27:08.740
There were the movements.

03:27:08.740 --> 03:27:11.740
There were the movements.

03:27:11.740 --> 03:27:14.740
There were the movements.

03:27:14.740 --> 03:27:17.740
There were the movements.

03:27:17.740 --> 03:27:19.740
There were the movements.

03:27:19.740 --> 03:27:22.740
There were the movements.

03:27:22.740 --> 03:27:25.740
There were the movements.

03:27:25.740 --> 03:27:29.740
There were the movements.

03:27:36.740 --> 03:27:41.740
It's the middle of winter in Moomin Valley.

03:27:41.740 --> 03:27:44.740
And all is quiet and peaceful in Moomin House.

03:27:44.740 --> 03:27:47.740
Is everybody enjoys their winter slumber.

03:27:47.740 --> 03:27:50.740
The house is full of dust covers.

03:27:50.740 --> 03:27:53.740
On the chandelier, on the furniture, on everything.

03:27:53.740 --> 03:27:57.740
Waiting until they all wake up again on the first day of spring.

03:27:57.740 --> 03:28:02.740
And start to get everything in Moomin House clean and ready for the coming summer.

03:28:02.740 --> 03:28:05.740
But what's this?

03:28:05.740 --> 03:28:09.740
It looks like Moomin is restless as if something has disturbed him.

03:28:09.740 --> 03:28:12.740
I wonder what he was dreaming about.

03:28:15.740 --> 03:28:18.740
I wonder what he was dreaming about.

03:28:18.740 --> 03:28:21.740
I wonder what he was dreaming about.

03:28:25.740 --> 03:28:29.740
I wonder what he was dreaming about.

03:28:29.740 --> 03:28:36.740
I wonder what time it is.

03:28:36.740 --> 03:28:40.740
Oh, it's nearly 20 after two.

03:28:40.740 --> 03:28:43.740
Wonder whether it's morning or afternoon.

03:28:43.740 --> 03:28:46.740
It doesn't really matter, I suppose.

03:28:46.740 --> 03:28:52.740
Oh, it's stopped.

03:28:52.740 --> 03:28:55.740
Oh, it's frozen.

03:28:55.740 --> 03:29:02.740
It looks really dark out there.

03:29:12.740 --> 03:29:19.740
Mama, Mama, please wake up.

03:29:20.740 --> 03:29:22.740
Papa, Papa.

03:29:22.740 --> 03:29:24.740
Mama, Mama.

03:29:24.740 --> 03:29:26.740
Mama, what's wrong with me?

03:29:26.740 --> 03:29:29.740
I feel way too weak.

03:29:29.740 --> 03:29:36.740
Oh.

03:29:46.740 --> 03:29:47.740
It's very odd.

03:29:47.740 --> 03:29:52.740
I don't usually wake up when I'm hibernating.

03:29:53.740 --> 03:29:59.740
Oh, dear.

03:29:59.740 --> 03:30:06.740
The whole house is buried in snow.

03:30:06.740 --> 03:30:13.740
Oh.

03:30:13.740 --> 03:30:20.740
Oh.

03:30:21.740 --> 03:30:27.740
Oh.

03:30:27.740 --> 03:30:34.740
Oh.

03:30:34.740 --> 03:30:39.740
Oh.

03:30:39.740 --> 03:30:46.740
Oh.

03:30:46.740 --> 03:30:53.740
Oh.

03:30:53.740 --> 03:31:00.740
Oh.

03:31:00.740 --> 03:31:05.740
This doesn't look like Moomin Valley.

03:31:05.740 --> 03:31:14.740
And it's so quiet.

03:31:14.740 --> 03:31:16.740
What was that?

03:31:16.740 --> 03:31:19.740
Perhaps I better go home.

03:31:19.740 --> 03:31:20.740
No.

03:31:20.740 --> 03:31:21.740
What's the matter with me?

03:31:21.740 --> 03:31:24.740
Everyone's asleep and the furniture's all covered up.

03:31:24.740 --> 03:31:31.740
And Moomin's don't give up.

03:31:39.740 --> 03:31:41.740
I wish enough can we're here.

03:31:42.740 --> 03:31:48.740
He's probably in the far south where it's warm and sunny.

03:31:48.740 --> 03:31:55.740
I wonder what that is.

03:32:19.740 --> 03:32:25.740
Oh.

03:32:25.740 --> 03:32:28.740
Oh.

03:32:28.740 --> 03:32:30.740
Oh.

03:32:30.740 --> 03:32:35.740
That sounds like...

03:32:35.740 --> 03:32:40.740
Oh, he has his little mind.

03:32:40.740 --> 03:32:43.740
By the bobo, what are you doing here, Moomin?

03:32:43.740 --> 03:32:45.740
What am I doing here?

03:32:45.740 --> 03:32:48.740
I heard strange noises and came to see what it was.

03:32:48.740 --> 03:32:50.740
Then you crashed into me like an avalanche.

03:32:50.740 --> 03:32:52.740
And I've just lifted the box off you.

03:32:52.740 --> 03:32:54.740
Oh, don't be stupid, Moomin.

03:32:54.740 --> 03:32:57.740
I mean, why are you out in the snow and not hibernating like the others?

03:32:57.740 --> 03:32:59.740
Spring's not for ages.

03:32:59.740 --> 03:33:00.740
Oh, I don't know.

03:33:00.740 --> 03:33:03.740
I just woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.

03:33:03.740 --> 03:33:05.740
But what about you sliding about like that?

03:33:05.740 --> 03:33:07.740
You should be asleep too.

03:33:07.740 --> 03:33:09.740
Yes, I should, but I just woke up as well.

03:33:09.740 --> 03:33:10.740
Probably to look after you.

03:33:10.740 --> 03:33:14.740
I tried to wake my stupid sister, but she kept on snoring.

03:33:14.740 --> 03:33:16.740
I think this snow is really great.

03:33:16.740 --> 03:33:17.740
Well, I don't.

03:33:17.740 --> 03:33:22.740
It's cold, it's slippy, much too bright, and it's everywhere and far too quiet.

03:33:22.740 --> 03:33:24.740
I saw the grog.

03:33:24.740 --> 03:33:25.740
Wow.

03:33:25.740 --> 03:33:28.740
That horrible freezing monster.

03:33:28.740 --> 03:33:32.740
She should feel at home in this, and there's no point in her trying to freeze anything.

03:33:32.740 --> 03:33:34.740
I saw her on the hill.

03:33:34.740 --> 03:33:36.740
Then it was her voice, I heard.

03:33:36.740 --> 03:33:41.740
Yes, and the trouble with the horrid thing is that she's so cold I wouldn't even want to touch her, Moomin.

03:33:41.740 --> 03:33:42.740
Huh?

03:33:42.740 --> 03:33:43.740
It's her!

03:33:43.740 --> 03:33:44.740
Oh.

03:33:44.740 --> 03:33:54.740
I'm getting cold shivers all over.

03:33:54.740 --> 03:33:56.740
Well, why don't you expect in the snow?

03:33:56.740 --> 03:33:58.740
No, it's the grog's fault.

03:33:58.740 --> 03:33:59.740
She's done it.

03:33:59.740 --> 03:34:01.740
Look at my skin, it's all goose bumpy.

03:34:01.740 --> 03:34:05.740
It's not like that in the summer, it's smooth, not lumpy.

03:34:05.740 --> 03:34:09.740
It's not the snow that makes me feel so cold, it's her staring at me.

03:34:09.740 --> 03:34:18.740
I'm scared.

03:34:18.740 --> 03:34:19.740
That was great.

03:34:19.740 --> 03:34:20.740
Good, isn't it?

03:34:20.740 --> 03:34:22.740
You can have as much as you like.

03:34:22.740 --> 03:34:24.740
We picked more raspberries than ever this year.

03:34:24.740 --> 03:34:26.740
The Mama made lots of juice.

03:34:26.740 --> 03:34:27.740
Thanks.

03:34:27.740 --> 03:34:29.740
Oh.

03:34:29.740 --> 03:34:30.740
Huh.

03:34:30.740 --> 03:34:33.740
I want that.

03:34:33.740 --> 03:34:35.740
Mama's silver tray?

03:34:35.740 --> 03:34:36.740
Yeah.

03:34:36.740 --> 03:34:37.740
What do you want it for?

03:34:37.740 --> 03:34:40.740
To slide on the snow with a coarse stupid?

03:34:40.740 --> 03:34:42.740
But it's a sort of family treasure in heirloom.

03:34:42.740 --> 03:34:45.740
Well, you never use it and it's so shiny.

03:34:45.740 --> 03:34:55.740
It'll make a great sled and go really fast.

03:34:55.740 --> 03:34:57.740
Doesn't look like they'll wake up till spring.

03:34:57.740 --> 03:34:59.740
They're lucky, they're still sleeping.

03:34:59.740 --> 03:35:05.740
I think it's very unfair that I woke up like this.

03:35:05.740 --> 03:35:07.740
So, what should we do now?

03:35:07.740 --> 03:35:09.740
I want to go look at the sea.

03:35:09.740 --> 03:35:10.740
Good idea.

03:35:10.740 --> 03:35:13.740
At least that won't be covered in snow.

03:35:25.740 --> 03:35:29.740
I bet the great cold was just like this.

03:35:32.740 --> 03:35:33.740
Oh no!

03:35:33.740 --> 03:35:34.740
What's the matter?

03:35:34.740 --> 03:35:35.740
I forgot the tray.

03:35:35.740 --> 03:35:36.740
Never mind.

03:35:36.740 --> 03:35:38.740
You can use it as a boat anyway.

03:35:38.740 --> 03:35:39.740
It would sink.

03:35:39.740 --> 03:35:40.740
Yes, you could.

03:35:40.740 --> 03:35:41.740
What?

03:35:41.740 --> 03:35:42.740
How?

03:35:42.740 --> 03:35:43.740
Oh look!

03:35:43.740 --> 03:35:44.740
There's the sink!

03:35:50.740 --> 03:35:52.740
But it's all frozen.

03:35:52.740 --> 03:35:54.740
So we'll be able to slide on it.

03:35:55.740 --> 03:35:57.740
What's that over there?

03:36:05.740 --> 03:36:06.740
Huh?

03:36:25.740 --> 03:36:26.740
Huh?

03:36:26.740 --> 03:36:28.740
Tootiki!

03:36:28.740 --> 03:36:30.740
Hello, you too.

03:36:31.740 --> 03:36:33.740
You're not hibernating either?

03:36:33.740 --> 03:36:35.740
Oh no.

03:36:35.740 --> 03:36:37.740
I haven't got time to spend four months sleeping.

03:36:37.740 --> 03:36:38.740
Why not?

03:36:38.740 --> 03:36:41.740
Little Mayan, I just woke up and now we don't know what to do.

03:36:41.740 --> 03:36:43.740
I'm sure you can think of something.

03:36:43.740 --> 03:36:44.740
Who's supposed to?

03:36:44.740 --> 03:36:47.740
I've never seen the sea frozen before.

03:36:47.740 --> 03:36:49.740
Did you make that horse tootiki?

03:36:49.740 --> 03:36:50.740
Yes, I did.

03:36:50.740 --> 03:36:51.740
Can I sit on it?

03:36:51.740 --> 03:36:52.740
No, you can't.

03:36:52.740 --> 03:36:54.740
I need it for the lady of the cold.

03:36:54.740 --> 03:36:56.740
Oh, I see.

03:36:56.740 --> 03:36:58.740
I suppose you've heard of her.

03:36:58.740 --> 03:37:00.740
Yes, she's very beautiful,

03:37:00.740 --> 03:37:01.740
but if she looks into your eyes,

03:37:01.740 --> 03:37:02.740
you're turned into a block of ice.

03:37:02.740 --> 03:37:04.740
She's not a very nice lady.

03:37:04.740 --> 03:37:05.740
That's right, Little Mayan.

03:37:05.740 --> 03:37:07.740
Spring can never come while she's here.

03:37:07.740 --> 03:37:09.740
It waits for her to go.

03:37:09.740 --> 03:37:10.740
Oh, I see.

03:37:10.740 --> 03:37:13.740
And are you hoping she'll ride away on this horse then?

03:37:14.740 --> 03:37:16.740
Yes, and it will take her back to the north,

03:37:16.740 --> 03:37:19.740
where she stays until she comes here again next winter

03:37:19.740 --> 03:37:21.740
and drives the sun away.

03:37:21.740 --> 03:37:24.740
The horse doesn't look very solid to me, Tootiki.

03:37:24.740 --> 03:37:26.740
Well, that's why I'm going to pour water over it

03:37:26.740 --> 03:37:29.740
when it gets really cold, and then it'll be solid.

03:37:30.740 --> 03:37:32.740
When is the lady of the cold coming?

03:37:32.740 --> 03:37:35.740
You can never tell, but soon, tonight, perhaps,

03:37:35.740 --> 03:37:38.740
it feels much colder already.

03:37:39.740 --> 03:37:40.740
My.

03:37:55.740 --> 03:37:57.740
What's happened to the sun, Tootiki?

03:37:57.740 --> 03:37:59.740
Do you know when the sun will come back again?

03:38:00.740 --> 03:38:01.740
Uh-huh.

03:38:01.740 --> 03:38:03.740
It's in the south shining on Snuffkin,

03:38:03.740 --> 03:38:04.740
but it'll be back soon,

03:38:04.740 --> 03:38:07.740
and then it will stay a bit longer each day.

03:38:07.740 --> 03:38:13.240
Good I can't wait, now there'll be a full moon tonight, and we'll be able to see everything.

03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:16.740
Great, I can get my tray out! I can't wait to try it on the sea!

03:38:16.740 --> 03:38:18.740
What do you mean, your tray?

03:38:18.740 --> 03:38:23.740
Well, let's move in, Mama's tray, but I'm using it. I'm going to put a sail on it and slide across the ice.

03:38:23.740 --> 03:38:25.740
Why not wait till tomorrow?

03:38:25.740 --> 03:38:29.740
Wait until tomorrow? No, when I want to do something, I do it now!

03:38:29.740 --> 03:38:32.740
What if the ice suddenly melts or something?

03:38:33.740 --> 03:38:34.740
Eh!

03:38:35.740 --> 03:38:36.740
Yeah!

03:38:37.740 --> 03:38:42.740
I like it here, it's warm and cozy. I hope Moomin Papa doesn't mind me using it.

03:38:42.740 --> 03:38:48.740
This is Papa's bathhouse. He build it himself, and he'd be very glad to know you're using it.

03:38:48.740 --> 03:38:51.740
It's great, the window paints are different colors.

03:38:51.740 --> 03:38:56.740
If you look out through one, the world is red, and through another one, the world is green.

03:39:02.740 --> 03:39:10.740
Oh, you don't hibernate either, do you?

03:39:10.740 --> 03:39:15.740
Now scram, the horrible lady of the cold is coming and if she looks you in the eye, you'll turn to ice!

03:39:15.740 --> 03:39:17.740
Go on, go away!

03:39:33.740 --> 03:39:35.740
Moomin!

03:39:35.740 --> 03:39:37.740
Tu-tiki!

03:39:37.740 --> 03:39:39.740
Moomin!

03:39:40.740 --> 03:39:41.740
Moomin!

03:39:41.740 --> 03:39:43.740
Tu-tiki, why are you?

03:39:43.740 --> 03:39:45.740
Little Mike, we're over here.

03:39:45.740 --> 03:39:46.740
Huh?

03:39:47.740 --> 03:39:49.740
Why are you doing down there?

03:39:49.740 --> 03:39:52.740
Tu-tiki's trying to catch some fish.

03:39:52.740 --> 03:39:55.740
If she does, she's going to cook us some dinner.

03:39:55.740 --> 03:39:58.740
Right, I've got to get sailing, man.

03:39:58.740 --> 03:40:01.740
I'd better go see what she's doing to Mama Silver tray.

03:40:01.740 --> 03:40:03.740
Okay.

03:40:06.740 --> 03:40:08.740
Ah, got one.

03:40:13.740 --> 03:40:15.740
Oh dear, me.

03:40:18.740 --> 03:40:21.740
She's cold and wet under that ice.

03:40:21.740 --> 03:40:22.740
How are you doing, little Mike?

03:40:22.740 --> 03:40:24.740
Very well, thank you.

03:40:26.740 --> 03:40:28.740
How can you get under the ice anyway?

03:40:28.740 --> 03:40:31.740
I guess the water must be low and there's a gap left there.

03:40:31.740 --> 03:40:32.740
Oh, how?

03:40:32.740 --> 03:40:37.740
I don't know, but perhaps the tide was in when the sea froze and some of it got stuck to the shore.

03:40:37.740 --> 03:40:40.740
Oh, I suppose it's possible.

03:40:40.740 --> 03:40:45.740
Tu-tiki told me that she has fish soup every day in the wintertime.

03:40:48.740 --> 03:40:51.740
I know, I'll go see if the horse is frozen yet.

03:40:51.740 --> 03:40:54.740
Make sure you shut the door behind you.

03:40:54.740 --> 03:40:56.740
Oh, my thumb!

03:40:59.740 --> 03:41:01.740
Hmm, I don't think it's hard enough yet.

03:41:01.740 --> 03:41:04.740
It'll collapse if the lady if the coke gets on it now.

03:41:07.740 --> 03:41:10.740
Oh, it's getting colder and colder.

03:41:11.740 --> 03:41:13.740
Oh, it's getting colder and colder.

03:41:14.740 --> 03:41:16.740
Oh, it's getting colder and colder.

03:41:38.740 --> 03:41:39.740
The grog.

03:41:44.740 --> 03:41:46.740
Don't tell me you want to ride the horse.

03:41:49.740 --> 03:41:51.740
I don't think you'd better.

03:41:52.740 --> 03:41:54.740
This is for the lady of the cold, you know.

03:41:57.740 --> 03:41:59.740
There's no telling what she'd do to you.

03:41:59.740 --> 03:42:01.740
Look you in the eye, probably.

03:42:14.740 --> 03:42:16.740
Even the grog is frightened of the lady of the cold.

03:42:19.740 --> 03:42:21.740
Ah, now it looks frozen.

03:42:25.740 --> 03:42:26.740
Wee!

03:42:28.740 --> 03:42:29.740
Wee!

03:42:37.740 --> 03:42:39.740
Great, isn't it, movement?

03:42:39.740 --> 03:42:41.740
Yeah, that old tree really moves.

03:42:41.740 --> 03:42:42.740
Wanna go?

03:42:42.740 --> 03:42:43.740
No thanks, I'm too big.

03:42:43.740 --> 03:42:44.740
Come on, now.

03:42:44.740 --> 03:42:47.740
The fish soup is ready and it's time you were inside, little my.

03:42:47.740 --> 03:42:49.740
Keep it warm for me, I'm having another go.

03:42:49.740 --> 03:42:51.740
No, little my.

03:42:51.740 --> 03:42:52.740
Why not?

03:42:52.740 --> 03:42:56.740
Have you forgotten what I told you the lady of the cold may be coming?

03:42:56.740 --> 03:42:57.740
Oh.

03:42:57.740 --> 03:42:59.740
Well, I want to see her.

03:42:59.740 --> 03:43:00.740
I'm not scared of her.

03:43:00.740 --> 03:43:02.740
I'll be moving so fast she won't get a chance.

03:43:02.740 --> 03:43:05.740
No, now listen to me, little my.

03:43:05.740 --> 03:43:08.740
All you have to do is not let her look you in the eye.

03:43:08.740 --> 03:43:11.740
But what happens if you're not quick enough and she catches you before you turn away?

03:43:12.740 --> 03:43:16.740
I know, if we watch her from the bathhouse, she won't see us.

03:43:20.740 --> 03:43:21.740
Please, little my.

03:43:21.740 --> 03:43:23.740
Come in, she's almost here.

03:43:23.740 --> 03:43:25.740
We can watch it from inside.

03:43:29.740 --> 03:43:30.740
That's no good.

03:43:30.740 --> 03:43:31.740
I want to see her properly.

03:43:31.740 --> 03:43:32.740
No, little my.

03:43:32.740 --> 03:43:33.740
No, little my.

03:43:33.740 --> 03:43:34.740
Don't go.

03:43:36.740 --> 03:43:37.740
No!

03:43:39.740 --> 03:43:40.740
Come back.

03:43:40.740 --> 03:43:41.740
Little my.

03:43:44.740 --> 03:43:45.740
Oh dear.

03:43:45.740 --> 03:43:48.740
Come on, let's get back in the cabin before it's too late.

03:43:48.740 --> 03:43:49.740
Wee!

03:44:03.740 --> 03:44:05.740
Oh, the lady of the cold.

03:44:06.740 --> 03:44:08.740
Come on.

03:44:32.740 --> 03:44:33.740
I saw her face.

03:44:34.740 --> 03:44:35.740
I saw her face.

03:44:35.740 --> 03:44:37.740
I saw her and she didn't turn away to eye.

03:44:40.740 --> 03:44:42.740
Press little my to get away with it.

03:44:42.740 --> 03:44:44.740
I don't know how she does it.

03:44:45.740 --> 03:44:47.740
I think her nerves are made of steel.

03:44:47.740 --> 03:44:49.740
I hope she's alright.

03:44:49.740 --> 03:44:52.740
She should try not to make so much noise out there.

03:45:04.740 --> 03:45:05.740
Oh dear.

03:45:10.740 --> 03:45:13.740
Oh dear.

03:45:25.740 --> 03:45:28.740
Oh dear.

03:45:34.740 --> 03:45:36.740
Oh dear.

03:45:40.740 --> 03:45:41.740
Yay!

03:45:41.740 --> 03:45:42.740
I saw her face.

03:45:42.740 --> 03:45:44.740
I saw her face.

03:45:52.740 --> 03:45:54.740
Come on.

03:46:00.740 --> 03:46:02.740
Come on, my friend.

03:46:02.740 --> 03:46:04.740
Oh no, don't stop now.

03:46:04.740 --> 03:46:05.740
No, my friend.

03:46:05.740 --> 03:46:06.740
Oh, this is it.

03:46:09.740 --> 03:46:10.740
Little my.

03:46:20.740 --> 03:46:26.740
Oh dear.

03:46:32.740 --> 03:46:34.740
Oh dear.

03:46:58.740 --> 03:47:00.740
Little my.

03:47:03.740 --> 03:47:05.740
Come on, please.

03:47:08.740 --> 03:47:10.740
Wake up, please.

03:47:14.740 --> 03:47:17.740
Oh please, don't stay frozen, little my.

03:47:17.740 --> 03:47:18.740
Don't worry, little my.

03:47:18.740 --> 03:47:19.740
We'll thought you out.

03:47:19.740 --> 03:47:20.740
Don't worry.

03:47:20.740 --> 03:47:22.740
It's nice and warm here.

03:47:33.740 --> 03:47:35.740
Oh, that's hot, moment.

03:47:35.740 --> 03:47:37.740
Praise the ball, Bob.

03:47:37.740 --> 03:47:39.740
You come back.

03:47:41.740 --> 03:47:45.740
So little my came back from the cold, little the worst for wear.

03:47:45.740 --> 03:47:47.740
Moment need not have worried.

03:47:47.740 --> 03:47:51.740
For the little mysars world are practically indestructible.

03:48:03.740 --> 03:48:10.740
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

03:48:10.740 --> 03:48:17.740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

03:48:17.740 --> 03:48:21.740
They're always happy and always at play.

03:48:21.740 --> 03:48:25.740
The movements are having fun day after day.

03:48:25.740 --> 03:48:28.740
The movements.

03:48:29.740 --> 03:48:32.740
The movements.

03:48:32.740 --> 03:48:39.740
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

03:48:39.740 --> 03:48:47.740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

03:48:47.740 --> 03:48:51.740
They're always happy and always at play.

03:48:51.740 --> 03:48:54.740
The movements are having fun day after day.

03:48:54.740 --> 03:48:58.740
The movements.

03:48:58.740 --> 03:49:01.740
The movements.

03:49:01.740 --> 03:49:08.740
The movements.

03:49:25.740 --> 03:49:30.740
Here they are for one and all.

03:49:30.740 --> 03:49:33.740
The movements are about to come.

03:49:33.740 --> 03:49:36.740
Come on and sit down here with me.

03:49:36.740 --> 03:49:38.740
They're here for you on your TV.

03:49:38.740 --> 03:49:41.740
They are the movements.

03:49:41.740 --> 03:49:44.740
They are the movements.

03:49:44.740 --> 03:49:47.740
So come with me, give me your hand.

03:49:47.740 --> 03:49:50.740
I'll take you up to a movement land.

03:49:50.740 --> 03:49:53.740
You can fly just like a bird.

03:49:53.740 --> 03:49:56.740
You sing the path song ever.

03:49:56.740 --> 03:49:58.740
There were the movements.

03:49:58.740 --> 03:50:01.740
There were the movements.

03:50:01.740 --> 03:50:04.740
They were the movements.

03:50:04.740 --> 03:50:07.740
There were the movements.

03:50:07.740 --> 03:50:10.740
There were the movements.

03:50:10.740 --> 03:50:13.740
They were the movements.

03:50:23.740 --> 03:50:53.740
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

03:50:53.740 --> 03:51:23.740
During the long winter in Moomin Valley, almost everybody living their hibernates until the sunshine comes again in the spring. But for some reason, Moomin and Little Mai woke up in the middle of it and couldn't get back to sleep.

03:51:23.740 --> 03:51:53.740
But for some reason, Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin and Moomin

03:51:53.740 --> 03:52:09.540
That was fun! Why don't you have a go Moomin? I'm probably a bit heavy for it. So get something else, dummy! I might later... Anyway, I thought we were gonna see Tuttaki. Come on, I'll pull you. Okay!

03:52:14.220 --> 03:52:20.800
I know why you don't wanna go Moomin. You're scared of sliding down from the top, aren't you? No, of course I'm not!

03:52:23.740 --> 03:52:32.740
Don't you think he's not here? I wonder where she's gone to.

03:52:32.740 --> 03:52:35.740
That's her over there, isn't it?

03:52:35.740 --> 03:52:37.740
Oh, yeah, I think it is.

03:52:37.740 --> 03:52:41.740
Jane, move in. She looks like she's sliding.

03:52:41.740 --> 03:52:42.740
Sliding?

03:52:42.740 --> 03:52:45.740
Yes, it's obvious. She's sliding, of course.

03:52:45.740 --> 03:52:49.740
She's coming over.

03:52:49.740 --> 03:52:52.740
What were you doing out there, too, Tiki?

03:52:52.740 --> 03:52:58.740
Stung go down. It's the only place you can see it from. I just caught it for it disappeared over the horizon.

03:52:58.740 --> 03:52:59.740
Where did it go to?

03:52:59.740 --> 03:53:03.740
It comes up again in the south and will probably shine on snuffkin.

03:53:03.740 --> 03:53:06.740
Hey, Tiki, what are those things you got on your feet?

03:53:06.740 --> 03:53:11.740
They're called skates and they're the best thing possible for moving across the ice quickly.

03:53:11.740 --> 03:53:14.740
Just what I need. Come on. Show me how to do it.

03:53:14.740 --> 03:53:18.740
Yes, okay?

03:53:18.740 --> 03:53:22.740
That's great. I'm going to make myself some skates, too.

03:53:22.740 --> 03:53:25.740
It's not as easy as you'd think, little lie.

03:53:25.740 --> 03:53:31.740
Pathetic. All you need is a sword and knife on your shoes and that sounds easy enough to me.

03:53:34.740 --> 03:53:41.740
You know, it's strange, but I've got a funny kind of feeling that there's someone else apart from us in the bathhouse.

03:53:41.740 --> 03:53:42.740
Hmm, well, there it is.

03:53:42.740 --> 03:53:45.740
Who is it? Where are they?

03:53:46.740 --> 03:53:48.740
Little lie, you can't see them.

03:53:48.740 --> 03:53:52.740
Huh, what do you mean I can't see them? Where are they hiding in the cupboard?

03:53:52.740 --> 03:53:56.740
No, they're invisible. Look, I'll show you.

03:54:02.740 --> 03:54:04.740
Oh, oh, there's something on my head.

03:54:04.740 --> 03:54:08.740
See, that's two of the shoe mice. They're eight of them all together.

03:54:08.740 --> 03:54:11.740
Now, don't walk a little lie.

03:54:12.740 --> 03:54:16.740
I didn't see any shoe mice here in the summer.

03:54:16.740 --> 03:54:19.740
Although, if they're invisible, I wouldn't have done.

03:54:19.740 --> 03:54:21.740
No, probably not.

03:54:21.740 --> 03:54:25.740
As in the summer when we come across new little animals that we've never seen before.

03:54:25.740 --> 03:54:29.740
And who likes snuffkin, go away when the wind and snow comes.

03:54:29.740 --> 03:54:34.740
Then when the days are shorter and everyone else is hibernating, they come out.

03:54:34.740 --> 03:54:37.740
And summer's so shy, they're invisible, dear.

03:54:37.740 --> 03:54:40.740
I'm afraid I don't understand winter at all.

03:54:40.740 --> 03:54:45.740
Well, of course you don't. You moments have always slept through and don't know very much about it.

03:54:45.740 --> 03:54:50.740
Oh, I can't wait to tell Mum or Papa about all this. They'll be really amazed.

03:54:56.740 --> 03:54:57.740
Moomin!

03:54:57.740 --> 03:54:58.740
What is it?

03:54:58.740 --> 03:55:01.740
We will wake up tomorrow, won't we, Moomin?

03:55:01.740 --> 03:55:03.740
I'm sure we will. Why?

03:55:03.740 --> 03:55:06.740
I just don't want to go on sleeping and sleeping until spring.

03:55:06.740 --> 03:55:08.740
Well, we woke up today, so...

03:55:08.740 --> 03:55:10.740
But we don't know about tomorrow.

03:55:10.740 --> 03:55:13.740
No, of course not. We'll have to wait and see.

03:55:13.740 --> 03:55:17.740
If we're awake, we'll know. And if we're asleep, then it doesn't matter.

03:55:17.740 --> 03:55:18.740
Hmm.

03:55:18.740 --> 03:55:22.740
Well, if I'm not awake and you are, wake me up, okay, Moomin?

03:55:22.740 --> 03:55:24.740
Yes, all right. Go to sleep now.

03:55:24.740 --> 03:55:26.740
What if it's the other way around, Moomin?

03:55:26.740 --> 03:55:30.740
Well, what if I wake up and you're still fast asleep?

03:55:30.740 --> 03:55:34.740
I don't mind sleeping all winter. Now, stop talking to me, my.

03:55:35.740 --> 03:55:37.740
You'd better wake me up or else.

03:56:01.740 --> 03:56:03.740
Hey, little mine.

03:56:03.740 --> 03:56:05.740
Where have you gone to?

03:56:16.740 --> 03:56:17.740
Hello.

03:56:17.740 --> 03:56:20.740
Well, well. Wonderful place for skiing, you've got here.

03:56:20.740 --> 03:56:23.740
What are those funny things on your feet?

03:56:24.740 --> 03:56:26.740
Hey, what? You're joking.

03:56:26.740 --> 03:56:27.740
Huh?

03:56:27.740 --> 03:56:29.740
You mean you really don't know what these are?

03:56:29.740 --> 03:56:31.740
That's why I'm asking you.

03:56:31.740 --> 03:56:34.740
Well, they're skis, didn't you see me come down?

03:56:34.740 --> 03:56:38.740
Yes, I did. Can you slide on the ice with these and go just as fast?

03:56:38.740 --> 03:56:41.740
Oh no, on ice, you have to use skates.

03:56:41.740 --> 03:56:43.740
What is that, young lady?

03:56:43.740 --> 03:56:47.740
Oh, it's a snowboard. You slide on the snow with it.

03:56:57.740 --> 03:57:00.740
That's not bad, but it's only your silver tray, isn't it?

03:57:00.740 --> 03:57:01.740
That's right, mister.

03:57:01.740 --> 03:57:02.740
I'll teach you to ski.

03:57:02.740 --> 03:57:04.740
No, thank you. I'll learn by watching you.

03:57:04.740 --> 03:57:06.740
Won't take me long at all.

03:57:06.740 --> 03:57:08.740
I'm afraid skiing is not that easy, young lady.

03:57:08.740 --> 03:57:10.740
Don't worry, it won't be for me.

03:57:10.740 --> 03:57:13.740
Everything is once I decide to do it.

03:57:20.740 --> 03:57:23.740
Oh, so you spend all year going where the snow is?

03:57:23.740 --> 03:57:25.740
That must be tiring.

03:57:25.740 --> 03:57:27.740
Not at all. Life should be a struggle.

03:57:28.740 --> 03:57:30.740
This jam is really good.

03:57:30.740 --> 03:57:34.740
Does it always have to be winter, catch a struggle in spring and summer instead?

03:57:34.740 --> 03:57:36.740
Well, no, that would be too easy.

03:57:36.740 --> 03:57:38.740
You could just sit back and relax.

03:57:38.740 --> 03:57:42.740
No, you've got to face up to the cold and exercise to keep warm.

03:57:42.740 --> 03:57:45.740
That sounds very interesting, Mr. Brisk.

03:57:45.740 --> 03:57:51.740
One clear cold bath a day keeps all those unnecessary thoughts away.

03:57:51.740 --> 03:57:53.740
My own little poem.

03:57:53.740 --> 03:57:56.740
What? You don't mean you swim in this weather, do you?

03:57:56.740 --> 03:57:58.740
The water must be very close to freezing.

03:57:58.740 --> 03:58:02.740
Well, the sea is a lot colder than that. It is frozen.

03:58:02.740 --> 03:58:03.740
Is there a river?

03:58:03.740 --> 03:58:07.740
Yes, there is, but the water looks very, very cold.

03:58:07.740 --> 03:58:09.740
Sounds just right.

03:58:09.740 --> 03:58:14.740
Have you got any more of this wonderful jam? It's delicious.

03:58:14.740 --> 03:58:18.740
There's some more in the cellar, but we've got cranberry up here if you'd like that.

03:58:18.740 --> 03:58:21.740
No, thanks. This will do for now.

03:58:21.740 --> 03:58:24.740
I'd appreciate some after my daily swim.

03:58:24.740 --> 03:58:26.740
It'll work up an appetite.

03:58:32.740 --> 03:58:34.740
This is great.

03:58:36.740 --> 03:58:39.740
I can hardly watch. It makes me shiver all over.

03:58:39.740 --> 03:58:41.740
Is everybody like you where you come from?

03:58:41.740 --> 03:58:44.740
Unfortunately not. Why did you join me?

03:58:44.740 --> 03:58:46.740
No, thank you.

03:58:47.740 --> 03:58:51.740
Hello, what are you two looking at?

03:58:51.740 --> 03:58:52.740
Huh?

03:58:53.740 --> 03:58:58.740
Oh, hello there, little dog. We're watching that madman down there.

03:59:03.740 --> 03:59:05.740
He looks like he's swimming.

03:59:05.740 --> 03:59:07.740
Moving valley is full of very odd people.

03:59:07.740 --> 03:59:10.740
He's not from moving valley as a matter of fact.

03:59:10.740 --> 03:59:12.740
Who are you?

03:59:12.740 --> 03:59:15.740
I'm sorry, and I'm looking for my brothers.

03:59:15.740 --> 03:59:18.740
I don't suppose you've seen them, have you?

03:59:18.740 --> 03:59:20.740
Your brothers, have you lost them?

03:59:20.740 --> 03:59:23.740
Are they hibernating somewhere, do you think?

03:59:23.740 --> 03:59:26.740
Oh, no, not them. They never do that.

03:59:26.740 --> 03:59:31.740
Well, everyone else in moving valley is hibernating, except little Mai here.

03:59:31.740 --> 03:59:36.740
Now, too ticky, and the invisible mice, me, oh, and that crazy person down in the middle.

03:59:37.740 --> 03:59:39.740
Oh, yeah!

03:59:43.740 --> 03:59:47.740
My brothers are up in the lonely mountains. Is that far from here?

03:59:47.740 --> 03:59:49.740
No, not far.

03:59:49.740 --> 03:59:54.740
Lonely mountains. I know there are wolves up there, but I never heard of any dogs.

03:59:54.740 --> 03:59:58.740
Well wolves and dogs are brothers, didn't you know?

03:59:58.740 --> 04:00:06.740
Oh, you know, this tastes even better after an invigorating swim.

04:00:06.740 --> 04:00:09.740
That's my favorite jam, much nicer than cranberry.

04:00:09.740 --> 04:00:12.740
Oh, I agree.

04:00:12.740 --> 04:00:16.740
Ah, doggie, now don't you want your jam?

04:00:16.740 --> 04:00:18.740
What? No, you have it.

04:00:18.740 --> 04:00:20.740
Oh, thank you.

04:00:20.740 --> 04:00:23.740
Oh, you look as though you're a bit worried about something.

04:00:23.740 --> 04:00:25.740
Yes, I suppose I am.

04:00:26.740 --> 04:00:29.740
Put it out of your mind.

04:00:29.740 --> 04:00:34.740
Why do you think your brothers are wolves? Did someone tell you they were?

04:00:34.740 --> 04:00:37.740
Of course they are. Everyone knows that.

04:00:37.740 --> 04:00:39.740
And besides, I can feel the wolf in me.

04:00:39.740 --> 04:00:43.740
Well, you might feel it, but nobody can see it for a star. Wolves are much bigger than you.

04:00:43.740 --> 04:00:48.740
I want to go and find them, and then we can all hell at the moon. I've been practicing.

04:00:48.740 --> 04:00:51.740
I can see why he wants to be a wolf, but we'd better keep him here.

04:00:51.740 --> 04:00:54.740
He could get hurt if he goes up there on his own.

04:00:54.740 --> 04:00:57.740
You don't really want to live with wolves, do you?

04:00:57.740 --> 04:00:59.740
Oh, I do very much.

04:00:59.740 --> 04:01:01.740
Why don't you travel around with me, sorry, you?

04:01:01.740 --> 04:01:04.740
I've got little dogs. They could be your brothers and sisters if you want.

04:01:04.740 --> 04:01:06.740
Well, I don't know.

04:01:06.740 --> 04:01:10.740
Look, I'm going to stay here in Moomin Valley for a while, and we can become great friends.

04:01:10.740 --> 04:01:12.740
You're going to stay here?

04:01:12.740 --> 04:01:18.740
Oh, yes. Marvelous slopes find swimming the most wonderful jam, and I'll build myself an igloo.

04:01:18.740 --> 04:01:20.740
An igloo? You mean a house made of snow?

04:01:20.740 --> 04:01:27.740
Yes, that's it, exactly. If it's all right with you, Moomin, I'll take this jam with me, just to keep me going.

04:01:45.740 --> 04:01:48.740
Hello there. Can I borrow your spade for a minute, Mr. Brisk?

04:01:48.740 --> 04:01:50.740
Of course. What for, my friend?

04:01:50.740 --> 04:01:52.740
I want to break up this barrel.

04:01:52.740 --> 04:01:55.740
Oh, that's easy. Allow me, little mind.

04:01:55.740 --> 04:01:58.740
Here, here, here.

04:01:58.740 --> 04:02:00.740
How's that, young lady?

04:02:05.740 --> 04:02:09.740
Mr. Brisk really loves this jam. He can't stop eating it.

04:02:09.740 --> 04:02:13.740
Well, it's very nice, Moomin. I can't imagine anyone not liking it.

04:02:13.740 --> 04:02:15.740
Do you know how to ski to a tiki?

04:02:15.740 --> 04:02:19.740
Well, of course I do. I just haven't done it yet.

04:02:19.740 --> 04:02:22.740
Mr. Brisk says that he's going to teach me.

04:02:22.740 --> 04:02:23.740
Oh.

04:02:25.740 --> 04:02:28.740
I can't move my legs tied up like this.

04:02:28.740 --> 04:02:32.740
That's the whole point. You don't have to. You just move your skis. Easy as winking.

04:02:38.740 --> 04:02:41.740
First of all, you have to learn how to fall properly.

04:02:41.740 --> 04:02:44.740
Well, then if I learn to ski first, then I won't fall.

04:02:50.740 --> 04:02:52.740
Little mind has skis, too.

04:02:52.740 --> 04:02:54.740
Oh, they're just made from an old barrel.

04:02:54.740 --> 04:02:56.740
Yours are much more sophisticated.

04:02:56.740 --> 04:03:00.740
Now then, Benjamin, ease and lean forward. Are you ready?

04:03:00.740 --> 04:03:03.740
I don't think I like this. It's too steep.

04:03:03.740 --> 04:03:05.740
Can I practice on something a bit flatter?

04:03:05.740 --> 04:03:09.740
Well, maybe next time. Now then, I'll have few rolls.

04:03:09.740 --> 04:03:11.740
Whoa!

04:03:13.740 --> 04:03:14.740
Whoa!

04:03:22.740 --> 04:03:25.740
Trying to start an avalanche movement?

04:03:25.740 --> 04:03:28.740
You know, I think this hill is even steeper than the last one.

04:03:28.740 --> 04:03:31.740
There's nothing to worry about. You've already mastered falling down.

04:03:31.740 --> 04:03:32.740
How if you go again?

04:03:32.740 --> 04:03:34.740
Whoa!

04:03:34.740 --> 04:03:36.740
Whoa!

04:03:36.740 --> 04:03:38.740
Whoa!

04:03:38.740 --> 04:03:40.740
Whoa!

04:03:40.740 --> 04:03:42.740
Whoa!

04:03:42.740 --> 04:03:44.740
Oh, stop it, please!

04:03:44.740 --> 04:03:47.740
You can do it yourself. Just calm down.

04:03:47.740 --> 04:03:49.740
Whoa!

04:03:49.740 --> 04:03:51.740
Whoa!

04:03:51.740 --> 04:03:53.740
Whoa!

04:03:53.740 --> 04:03:56.740
Oh, look at that marvelous you need!

04:03:56.740 --> 04:04:00.740
Please, someone, stop it, please!

04:04:00.740 --> 04:04:02.740
Whoa!

04:04:03.740 --> 04:04:06.740
That was terrific moment. Let's do it again!

04:04:06.740 --> 04:04:08.740
Whoa!

04:04:16.740 --> 04:04:18.740
What are you looking at, sorry you?

04:04:18.740 --> 04:04:20.740
I can hear all my brothers howling out there.

04:04:20.740 --> 04:04:22.740
They're probably hungry and looking for food.

04:04:22.740 --> 04:04:25.740
No, I know they're calling me.

04:04:25.740 --> 04:04:29.740
I'm going to see them. I've really got to a moment.

04:04:32.740 --> 04:04:34.740
Whoa!

04:04:40.740 --> 04:04:42.740
Oh.

04:04:43.740 --> 04:04:45.740
Got anything?

04:04:45.740 --> 04:04:47.740
No, not yet.

04:04:47.740 --> 04:04:50.740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble. We're running out of jam.

04:04:50.740 --> 04:04:52.740
Mr. Bresch, I suppose.

04:04:52.740 --> 04:04:54.740
You can't stop eating it.

04:04:54.740 --> 04:04:56.740
Well, you have to ask him to leave.

04:04:56.740 --> 04:04:58.740
I can't do that.

04:04:58.740 --> 04:05:02.740
Of course you can. It's your home and you can choose who you have.

04:05:12.740 --> 04:05:15.740
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

04:05:15.740 --> 04:05:18.740
Usually a sign that spring is not far away.

04:05:29.740 --> 04:05:32.740
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

04:05:32.740 --> 04:05:34.740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

04:05:34.740 --> 04:05:36.740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

04:05:36.740 --> 04:05:38.740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

04:05:38.740 --> 04:05:40.740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

04:05:40.740 --> 04:05:42.740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

04:05:42.740 --> 04:05:44.740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

04:05:44.740 --> 04:05:46.740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

04:05:46.740 --> 04:05:48.740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

04:05:48.740 --> 04:05:50.740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

04:05:50.740 --> 04:05:52.740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

04:05:52.740 --> 04:05:54.740
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble.

04:05:55.740 --> 04:05:57.740
I'm afraid.

04:06:10.740 --> 04:06:12.740
Hello, woman!

04:06:12.740 --> 04:06:14.740
Oh, hello, Mr. Bresch!

04:06:14.740 --> 04:06:16.740
I'm sorry, but all the jams gone.

04:06:16.740 --> 04:06:18.740
It's just an empty jar.

04:06:18.740 --> 04:06:20.740
Oh, well, never mind.

04:06:20.740 --> 04:06:22.740
It was a great jam.

04:06:22.740 --> 04:06:27.140
things on my mind. You see, now that spring is here, I have to leave, Moomin Valley.

04:06:29.220 --> 04:06:30.500
Oh, do you?

04:06:32.660 --> 04:06:36.980
It's sad, but there you are. I have to go. Goodbye, Moomin.

04:06:36.980 --> 04:06:38.420
Goodbye, then, Mr. Bursk.

04:06:39.140 --> 04:06:49.620
Keep some jam for me.

04:06:52.740 --> 04:07:20.740
Hello, I'm sorry. I'm your brother. I've wanted to be with you for a long, long time. I'm afraid I'm not very brave or strong, but if you'd let me stay with you...

04:07:22.740 --> 04:07:24.420
Oh, don't you know me?

04:07:26.420 --> 04:07:31.620
Looks like I was wrong. Oh, well, go on. Eat me if you want to.

04:07:39.460 --> 04:07:45.300
It's a pity I didn't sleep at night instead of learning to how Moomin was right. I shouldn't have come.

04:07:52.740 --> 04:08:22.740
I'm sorry, Moomin, I'm sorry, I didn't sleep at night, I'm sorry, I didn't sleep at night, I'm sorry, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I

04:08:22.740 --> 04:08:52.740
didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night

04:08:52.740 --> 04:09:22.740
I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep

04:09:22.740 --> 04:09:52.740
I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night, I didn't sleep at night

04:09:52.740 --> 04:10:04.340
but it's always time to rest, it's always time to rest, and it's always time to rest, and it's always time to rest, and it's always time to rest, me

04:10:05.080 --> 04:10:07.280
Look, a little boy, Hang on to me

04:10:08.240 --> 04:10:11.500
Thank you, Moonman! Let's go!

04:10:20.920 --> 04:10:22.360
It's alright Moonman, don't panic. I'm with you. You're okay!

04:10:22.740 --> 04:10:24.740
Oh, oh!

04:10:25.740 --> 04:10:27.740
Over there, moving! Quick, do!

04:10:29.740 --> 04:10:31.740
See, if you knew what I'd tell you,

04:10:31.740 --> 04:10:33.740
there's nothing to be afraid of.

04:10:33.740 --> 04:10:35.740
Just trust me, moving. I'm always right, aren't I?

04:10:35.740 --> 04:10:37.740
Yes, I know you are, little my,

04:10:37.740 --> 04:10:39.740
but we'd still better hurry.

04:10:42.740 --> 04:10:45.740
Come on, you two, just a bit further!

04:10:45.740 --> 04:10:46.740
Come on!

04:10:51.740 --> 04:10:53.740
No!

04:10:53.740 --> 04:10:54.740
Wow!

04:10:55.740 --> 04:10:57.740
Oh, it's cold in here.

04:10:57.740 --> 04:11:01.740
Quickly, let's get inside and light a fire, you'll soon warm up!

04:11:05.740 --> 04:11:06.740
Phew!

04:11:06.740 --> 04:11:16.740
And so Mr. Brisk and the ice both left human valley,

04:11:16.740 --> 04:11:21.740
and spring returned once more after a long and eventful winter.

04:11:23.740 --> 04:11:29.740
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements,

04:11:29.740 --> 04:11:36.740
believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:11:36.740 --> 04:11:40.740
They're always happy and always at play,

04:11:40.740 --> 04:11:51.740
the movements are having fun day after day, the movements, the movements,

04:11:51.740 --> 04:11:58.740
they loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements,

04:11:58.740 --> 04:12:05.740
believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:12:05.740 --> 04:12:10.740
They're always happy and always at play,

04:12:10.740 --> 04:12:17.740
the movements are having fun day after day, the movements,

04:12:17.740 --> 04:12:27.740
the movements, the movements.

04:12:27.740 --> 04:12:52.740
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come,

04:12:52.740 --> 04:12:55.740
come on and sit down here with me,

04:12:55.740 --> 04:13:00.740
therefore you aren't your TV, they are the movements,

04:13:00.740 --> 04:13:03.740
they are the movements,

04:13:03.740 --> 04:13:06.740
so come with me, give me your hand,

04:13:06.740 --> 04:13:09.740
I'll take you up to a moment land,

04:13:09.740 --> 04:13:12.740
you can fly just like a bird,

04:13:12.740 --> 04:13:17.740
sing that song ever, there were the movements,

04:13:18.740 --> 04:13:29.740
there were the movements, there were the movements,

04:13:29.740 --> 04:13:33.740
there were the movements.

04:13:47.740 --> 04:14:17.740
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

04:14:17.740 --> 04:14:47.740
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba It's spring again in Moomin Valley, And after their long winter hybrination, everyone is awake and enjoying the sunshine and the flowers. Everyone that is accept for Moomin was in bed with a terrible cold.

04:14:47.740 --> 04:14:59.420
Oh dear, moment, that's a nasty cough.

04:14:59.420 --> 04:15:02.180
My throat is very sore.

04:15:02.180 --> 04:15:03.260
This will help soothe it.

04:15:03.260 --> 04:15:06.700
It's one of grandma's best potions.

04:15:06.700 --> 04:15:10.500
It's hard.

04:15:10.500 --> 04:15:11.500
Never mind.

04:15:11.500 --> 04:15:14.500
Nice tasting medicines don't always work as well.

04:15:15.500 --> 04:15:19.340
I wanted to go out, it's spring.

04:15:19.340 --> 04:15:23.500
I know dear, but you'd catch pneumonia or something.

04:15:23.500 --> 04:15:29.500
Mama, does anyone know why snuffkin hasn't come back yet?

04:15:29.500 --> 04:15:37.500
No, perhaps spring came earlier this year and he wasn't ready.

04:15:37.500 --> 04:15:43.140
Snuffkin had always come back to Moonman Valley on the very first day of spring.

04:15:43.140 --> 04:15:49.140
But not this year.

04:15:49.140 --> 04:15:57.140
Snuffkin.

04:15:57.140 --> 04:15:58.140
Hi, moment, Papa.

04:15:58.140 --> 04:15:59.140
Is moment any better?

04:15:59.140 --> 04:16:01.140
No, I'm afraid not.

04:16:01.140 --> 04:16:02.140
He's still got a nasty cough.

04:16:02.140 --> 04:16:04.140
Can I go up and see him?

04:16:04.140 --> 04:16:05.140
No, you'd better not.

04:16:05.140 --> 04:16:11.140
You might catch it.

04:16:12.140 --> 04:16:14.140
You know how poorly you get when you're ill.

04:16:14.140 --> 04:16:15.140
It's best not to take the risk.

04:16:15.140 --> 04:16:18.140
I should think he'll be up and about before very long.

04:16:18.140 --> 04:16:21.140
Yes, it's better to be safe than sorry.

04:16:21.140 --> 04:16:25.140
Moment shouldn't have gone out in the winter, should he, Mama?

04:16:25.140 --> 04:16:27.140
No, but he couldn't go back to sleep.

04:16:27.140 --> 04:16:30.140
Snow would have that effect on anyone.

04:16:30.140 --> 04:16:34.140
I knew little Mai was out in the cold with him and look at her.

04:16:34.140 --> 04:16:38.140
She seems healthy enough.

04:16:38.140 --> 04:16:40.140
I'll take these flowers to Moonman later.

04:16:40.140 --> 04:16:50.140
Little Mai's too small to catch a cold.

04:16:50.140 --> 04:16:52.140
This is boring.

04:16:52.140 --> 04:16:55.140
I can't believe that Moonman's sick.

04:16:55.140 --> 04:16:58.140
And Snuffkin's not back either.

04:16:58.140 --> 04:17:00.140
I sure wonder what's happened to him.

04:17:00.140 --> 04:17:04.140
I bet you moment gets better as soon as Snuffkin arrives in Moonman Valley.

04:17:04.140 --> 04:17:08.140
He's never been this late coming back before.

04:17:08.140 --> 04:17:11.140
Perhaps he's got fed up with you guys.

04:17:11.140 --> 04:17:13.140
Impossible. He's very fond of me.

04:17:13.140 --> 04:17:15.140
He's told me so lots of times.

04:17:15.140 --> 04:17:18.140
He likes Moonman too, of course.

04:17:18.140 --> 04:17:21.140
He might have been captured by a highwayman.

04:17:21.140 --> 04:17:23.140
Let's go and look for him.

04:17:23.140 --> 04:17:25.140
A highwayman?

04:17:25.140 --> 04:17:26.140
First Snuffkin, silly.

04:17:26.140 --> 04:17:28.140
He's got to come back so Moonman will get better.

04:17:28.140 --> 04:17:30.140
We must find him.

04:17:30.140 --> 04:17:32.140
But where do we look, Snork Maiden?

04:17:32.140 --> 04:17:33.140
In the south.

04:17:33.140 --> 04:17:35.140
It's a big place. He could be anywhere.

04:17:35.140 --> 04:17:38.140
Well, I don't care how big it is I'm going anyway.

04:17:38.140 --> 04:17:39.140
You're being silly.

04:17:39.140 --> 04:17:40.140
No, I'm not.

04:17:40.140 --> 04:17:42.140
I don't think your brother will like it.

04:17:42.140 --> 04:17:44.140
In fact, I know he won't.

04:17:44.140 --> 04:17:46.140
Have you gone completely bananas?

04:17:46.140 --> 04:17:48.140
No, I haven't.

04:17:48.140 --> 04:17:50.140
And you'll just have to make your own muffins.

04:17:50.140 --> 04:17:52.140
There's more to food than muffins.

04:17:52.140 --> 04:17:54.140
I was speaking figuratively.

04:17:54.140 --> 04:17:56.140
Anyway, I'm going, dear brother.

04:17:56.140 --> 04:17:59.140
And nothing you can do or say will stop me.

04:17:59.140 --> 04:18:00.140
It's for Moonman.

04:18:00.140 --> 04:18:02.140
That's a sort of hair brain scheme

04:18:02.140 --> 04:18:04.140
that could only have been dreamed up by you.

04:18:04.140 --> 04:18:05.140
What good will it do?

04:18:05.140 --> 04:18:07.140
You don't even know where he is.

04:18:07.140 --> 04:18:10.140
It is not. Moonman is pining for Snuffkin.

04:18:10.140 --> 04:18:11.140
Rubbish.

04:18:11.140 --> 04:18:13.140
Men don't pine for their friends.

04:18:13.140 --> 04:18:15.140
If he isn't back yet, then he isn't coming.

04:18:15.140 --> 04:18:18.140
And if he isn't going to come, what's the point of looking for him?

04:18:18.140 --> 04:18:20.140
You won't find him anyway.

04:18:22.140 --> 04:18:25.140
He will come when he knows that Moonman is sick.

04:18:25.140 --> 04:18:27.140
Black mails just like a sister.

04:18:27.140 --> 04:18:30.140
Something done for love could never be blackmail.

04:18:30.140 --> 04:18:32.140
Oh no, you're not going and that's fine.

04:18:32.140 --> 04:18:35.140
Look, why don't you and Little My go by yourselves?

04:18:35.140 --> 04:18:38.140
Oh, well, I didn't really make a definite decision.

04:18:38.140 --> 04:18:40.140
I just sort of said that I might come along.

04:18:40.140 --> 04:18:43.140
But if Snort Maiden isn't going, then there doesn't seem any point.

04:18:43.140 --> 04:18:44.140
Does there?

04:18:44.140 --> 04:18:47.140
And I'm not going because I think it's stupid and hair brain too.

04:18:47.140 --> 04:18:49.140
Snuffkin will come back soon.

04:18:49.140 --> 04:18:50.140
Not Snort Maiden.

04:18:50.140 --> 04:18:51.140
What do you say to that?

04:18:59.140 --> 04:19:01.140
How is Moonman feeling any better?

04:19:01.140 --> 04:19:04.140
He's asleep now, but the cough doesn't seem so bad.

04:19:04.140 --> 04:19:05.140
And his temperature?

04:19:05.140 --> 04:19:06.140
Still quite high.

04:19:32.140 --> 04:19:33.140
Snuffkin!

04:19:52.140 --> 04:19:54.140
Am I pleased to see you, Moonman?

04:19:54.140 --> 04:19:56.140
You look like you needed a lift.

04:19:56.140 --> 04:20:00.140
This magic cloud must be one of those we got from the Hobgoblin's top hat.

04:20:01.140 --> 04:20:03.140
That's right. I had one of them away.

04:20:03.140 --> 04:20:06.140
What a good idea, Moonman. You are clever.

04:20:06.140 --> 04:20:09.140
Well, it was so much fun the last time, wasn't it?

04:20:09.140 --> 04:20:10.140
Hi, Moonman!

04:20:10.140 --> 04:20:11.140
Hi!

04:20:11.140 --> 04:20:13.140
Oh, look, Snuffkin.

04:20:13.140 --> 04:20:15.140
I didn't know they were here, too.

04:20:20.140 --> 04:20:21.140
Snuffkin!

04:20:25.140 --> 04:20:27.140
Moments!

04:20:27.140 --> 04:20:28.140
Snuffkin!

04:20:31.140 --> 04:20:32.140
Oh!

04:20:38.140 --> 04:20:40.140
Not just a dream.

04:20:40.140 --> 04:20:41.140
Snuffkin!

04:20:48.140 --> 04:20:50.140
You look blousy, Moonman.

04:20:50.140 --> 04:20:53.140
Oh, thanks, stinky. You'd better keep away.

04:20:53.140 --> 04:20:55.140
There's no need bugs and things like that.

04:20:55.140 --> 04:20:56.140
Stay away from me.

04:20:56.140 --> 04:20:58.140
They're probably frightened of someone so healthy.

04:20:58.140 --> 04:21:01.140
Mom, I wasn't letting anyone in here. It's very dull.

04:21:01.140 --> 04:21:03.140
You followed a bed or something?

04:21:03.140 --> 04:21:04.140
Yes, I did.

04:21:04.140 --> 04:21:06.140
I know. You were dreaming, weren't you?

04:21:06.140 --> 04:21:08.140
Unfortunately, yes.

04:21:08.140 --> 04:21:10.140
I know how you feel.

04:21:10.140 --> 04:21:12.140
I have that dream a lot.

04:21:12.140 --> 04:21:17.140
Oh, you stand on a windowsill getting ready to break the glass

04:21:17.140 --> 04:21:19.140
and inside there's diamonds.

04:21:19.140 --> 04:21:21.140
And then, Moonman, you fall.

04:21:21.140 --> 04:21:23.140
It's not the same dream at all, stinky.

04:21:23.140 --> 04:21:25.140
Snuffkin hasn't come back yet.

04:21:25.140 --> 04:21:27.140
Have you heard anything from him?

04:21:27.140 --> 04:21:28.140
He's very late.

04:21:28.140 --> 04:21:30.140
Oh, Snuffkin.

04:21:30.140 --> 04:21:32.140
Huh. You know something, don't you?

04:21:32.140 --> 04:21:35.140
All I know is that he went away as usual last autumn

04:21:35.140 --> 04:21:36.140
and hasn't come back yet.

04:21:36.140 --> 04:21:37.140
And then...

04:21:37.140 --> 04:21:38.140
Yes, what?

04:21:38.140 --> 04:21:41.140
Snork Maiden wanted to go looking for him because she thinks

04:21:41.140 --> 04:21:44.140
that if Snuffkin comes back, you won't be sick anymore.

04:21:44.140 --> 04:21:46.140
But Snork wouldn't let her.

04:21:46.140 --> 04:21:48.140
Snork Maiden?

04:21:50.140 --> 04:21:52.140
Hey, Snork Maiden!

04:21:52.140 --> 04:21:54.140
Snork Maiden!

04:21:58.140 --> 04:22:00.140
You're not serious, are you?

04:22:00.140 --> 04:22:02.140
I feel perfectly alright.

04:22:02.140 --> 04:22:05.140
You look like that's warmed up if you ask me.

04:22:05.140 --> 04:22:06.140
Thanks a lot.

04:22:06.140 --> 04:22:11.140
Now, stinky, tell me which way does Snuffkin normally travel south?

04:22:11.140 --> 04:22:13.140
Hey, are you going looking for him?

04:22:13.140 --> 04:22:17.140
Yes, it's not really spring in Moonman Valley if he's not around.

04:22:17.140 --> 04:22:19.140
It's just not right somehow.

04:22:19.140 --> 04:22:22.140
Okay, you're all as mad as each other.

04:22:22.140 --> 04:22:24.140
But you'll help me?

04:22:24.140 --> 04:22:27.140
I've got to try and find him, stinky.

04:22:27.140 --> 04:22:30.140
Yes, alright, but don't tell your parents I helped you.

04:22:30.140 --> 04:22:32.140
Don't worry, I won't say a thing.

04:22:48.140 --> 04:22:51.140
Sorry, stinky, are you okay?

04:22:51.140 --> 04:22:53.140
No, I'm fine.

04:22:55.140 --> 04:22:58.140
Here's your lunch, Moonman. How are you feeling?

04:22:58.140 --> 04:23:00.140
Moonman?

04:23:00.140 --> 04:23:03.140
Papa, come here quickly.

04:23:06.140 --> 04:23:09.140
Oh, Papa, Moonman's gone. He's not in his bed.

04:23:09.140 --> 04:23:12.140
Not in his bed? Are you sure, Mama?

04:23:12.140 --> 04:23:17.140
Of course I am. His room is empty and there's no sign of him.

04:23:18.140 --> 04:23:20.140
Perhaps he's in one of the other rooms.

04:23:20.140 --> 04:23:22.140
Don't worry, Mama, I'll find him.

04:23:25.140 --> 04:23:28.140
Yo, Moonman.

04:23:29.140 --> 04:23:31.140
Moonman.

04:23:32.140 --> 04:23:34.140
Hi, Moonman, Papa.

04:23:34.140 --> 04:23:35.140
Oh, little Mai.

04:23:35.140 --> 04:23:37.140
What's wrong? You look worried.

04:23:37.140 --> 04:23:39.140
Moonman's gone off somewhere.

04:23:39.140 --> 04:23:42.140
I expect he must have gone to look for Snuffkin.

04:23:42.140 --> 04:23:44.140
Snuffkin?

04:23:44.140 --> 04:23:47.140
Well, you know how crazy Moonman is about him.

04:23:47.140 --> 04:23:49.140
It's stupid if you ask me.

04:23:49.140 --> 04:23:52.140
But he's not well, he's got a fever.

04:24:15.140 --> 04:24:19.140
Are you sure this is the right way?

04:24:19.140 --> 04:24:22.140
Of course I'm sure. I live in this forest, don't I?

04:24:22.140 --> 04:24:24.140
Why don't we miss each other somewhere?

04:24:24.140 --> 04:24:27.140
Well, if you think he might, don't go there and it's up to you.

04:24:27.140 --> 04:24:29.140
But I've got to...

04:24:32.140 --> 04:24:33.140
Moonman!

04:24:33.140 --> 04:24:35.140
Oh, Snuffkin!

04:24:35.140 --> 04:24:37.140
Huh?

04:24:37.140 --> 04:24:40.140
Where are you taking him, Stinky? You can see he's not well.

04:24:40.140 --> 04:24:44.140
I'm not taking him. He insisted on going. I came to look after him.

04:24:44.140 --> 04:24:46.140
Is that really right, Moonman?

04:24:46.140 --> 04:24:50.140
Yes, I wanted to find Snuffkin, so he'd come back.

04:24:50.140 --> 04:24:52.140
Well, I was going to find him for you.

04:24:52.140 --> 04:24:55.140
Little Mai and Sniff were coming too, but they chickened out so I came on my own.

04:24:55.140 --> 04:24:58.140
What did Snork say about that? I bet he wasn't happy.

04:24:58.140 --> 04:25:00.140
Oh, he made a big fuss and I just let him.

04:25:00.140 --> 04:25:02.140
So you just walked out and came on your own?

04:25:02.140 --> 04:25:04.140
Brothers, always think they can tell you what to do.

04:25:04.140 --> 04:25:07.140
I just ignored him. Did you tell your parents where you were?

04:25:07.140 --> 04:25:09.140
Ah, no.

04:25:09.140 --> 04:25:12.140
Did you put him up to this, Stinky? It's just the sort of thing you do.

04:25:12.140 --> 04:25:13.140
No, I did not.

04:25:13.140 --> 04:25:15.140
That's true, Snork Maiden.

04:25:17.140 --> 04:25:21.140
Well, I don't know how you did it, Stinky, but I know you and I know you're to blame and I don't think I won't find out.

04:25:21.140 --> 04:25:24.140
That's not fair, Snork Maiden. It was nothing to do with me at all.

04:25:24.140 --> 04:25:26.140
Oh, he's right, Snork Maiden.

04:25:26.140 --> 04:25:29.140
He didn't want to show me the way, but I made him.

04:25:31.140 --> 04:25:33.140
I'm taking you home.

04:25:33.140 --> 04:25:34.140
Oh, but Snork Maiden.

04:25:34.140 --> 04:25:39.140
Look, no buttons. You're sick and you should be in bed and your parents must be very worried.

04:25:39.140 --> 04:25:41.140
Look!

04:25:41.140 --> 04:25:42.140
Moomin!

04:25:42.140 --> 04:25:45.140
Oh, it's Papa. It isn't Snork behind him.

04:25:45.140 --> 04:25:47.140
Oh, yes, it is.

04:25:47.140 --> 04:25:49.140
Uh-oh, it's time I wasn't here.

04:25:49.140 --> 04:25:53.140
I'm glad you hadn't gone too far, Moomin. I might never have found you.

04:25:53.140 --> 04:25:55.140
I'm very sorry, Papa.

04:25:57.140 --> 04:26:01.140
I have a feeling you're behind this, Stinky. Come on quickly, I'll with it.

04:26:01.140 --> 04:26:05.140
Why doesn't anyone believe me? It was Moomin's idea. I swear it was.

04:26:05.140 --> 04:26:08.140
It was, Papa. I wanted to find Snorkkin.

04:26:08.140 --> 04:26:11.140
Are you all right, Moomin?

04:26:11.140 --> 04:26:13.140
Snork Maiden!

04:26:14.140 --> 04:26:17.140
Uh, here we go again.

04:26:17.140 --> 04:26:21.140
Snork Maiden, what are you doing here? I thought I told you not to go on this silly jump.

04:26:21.140 --> 04:26:24.140
Well, I didn't say I wouldn't. Did I?

04:26:24.140 --> 04:26:26.140
Listen to me, Snork.

04:26:26.140 --> 04:26:30.140
You're looking guilty, Stinky. How did you persuade her to disobey me?

04:26:30.140 --> 04:26:32.140
See, I told you.

04:26:38.140 --> 04:26:42.140
You stay nice and warm in bed and I'll mix some of grandma's potion with honey for you.

04:26:42.140 --> 04:26:47.140
You'll have to be better soon because I have a feeling Snuffkin's on his way.

04:26:53.140 --> 04:26:57.140
My wish Snuffkin would hurry up, then we could all get back to normal at last.

04:26:57.140 --> 04:27:00.140
First, my sentiment's exactly.

04:27:00.140 --> 04:27:05.140
So where is Snuffkin? Well, he's on his way back to Moomin Valley.

04:27:05.140 --> 04:27:10.140
But he's had a very long walk and is getting very tired now.

04:27:10.140 --> 04:27:25.140
Poor Snuffkin. He's had a terrible cold as well. This feeling rather weak.

04:27:41.140 --> 04:27:52.140
Hello, I know you don't I?

04:27:52.140 --> 04:27:56.140
Oh? Yes, you're Snuffkin.

04:28:10.140 --> 04:28:13.140
Isn't that water still a little cold for that?

04:28:21.140 --> 04:28:25.140
You'd better come by the fire and keep warm or you'll catch cold.

04:28:30.140 --> 04:28:33.140
This is nice.

04:28:33.140 --> 04:28:44.140
I'll be the one that's that by Snuffkin's fire. And he told me to keep warm and not catch cold.

04:28:44.140 --> 04:28:48.140
That's no big thing, little fella. It's a pretty chilly night out here.

04:28:48.140 --> 04:28:52.140
Oh, it is. I've heard so many stories about you from everybody.

04:28:52.140 --> 04:28:57.140
And each year I try to watch you go past, but I've never been brave enough to talk to you before.

04:28:57.140 --> 04:29:02.140
Stories from everybody. I don't know if I like that. In fact, I'm sure I don't.

04:29:02.140 --> 04:29:05.140
What's your name, little fella?

04:29:05.140 --> 04:29:12.140
Oh, well, I haven't got one. I'm so small that nobody's ever asked me before. I've always wanted to have a name, you know.

04:29:12.140 --> 04:29:19.140
And it was you who asked me. And I've actually met you and sat next to you at your campfire. Oh, it's so wonderful.

04:29:19.140 --> 04:29:22.140
You don't know how happy it makes me meeting you like this.

04:29:22.140 --> 04:29:25.140
Oh, come on. You do go on a bit, old fella. You just get warm now.

04:29:25.140 --> 04:29:33.140
Do you think Snuffkin? Oh, I don't know whether I should ask you. I don't want to offend you. Oh, well, why not? Yes, I will.

04:29:33.140 --> 04:29:40.140
Perhaps you'd be kind enough to. I mean, would it be too much trouble for you to think of a name for me?

04:29:40.140 --> 04:29:44.140
There. I've said it now.

04:29:44.140 --> 04:29:49.140
Well, choosing a name is important. I'd have to think carefully about that.

04:29:49.140 --> 04:29:52.140
But it will be easy for you. You know everything.

04:29:52.140 --> 04:29:57.140
Now listen to me. You can't look up to people too much if you want to be yourself. It's not right.

04:29:57.140 --> 04:30:02.140
But Snuffkin, you're so clever. You can do anything, anything at all. I know you can.

04:30:02.140 --> 04:30:07.140
I've always wanted to be free like you to do whatever I feel.

04:30:07.140 --> 04:30:13.140
Oh, I'm sorry I'm talking too much. I want to listen to you too. All about your travels for a start.

04:30:13.140 --> 04:30:16.140
I know you're on your way to the Moon Valley to see all your friends.

04:30:16.140 --> 04:30:21.140
The Hedgehog told me the Moon stayed up for most of the winter. Just waiting for you to come back.

04:30:21.140 --> 04:30:23.140
Now isn't that wonderful? What?

04:30:23.140 --> 04:30:27.140
I'd love to have someone that missed me so much they were miserable until I came back.

04:30:27.140 --> 04:30:30.140
You don't know how lucky you are that you're so special.

04:30:30.140 --> 04:30:35.140
Well, perhaps I'm not going there. I might have somewhere else to visit instead.

04:30:38.140 --> 04:30:42.140
Oh, Moon will be very sad if you don't go back.

04:30:42.140 --> 04:30:45.140
Yes, but you've got to have time to be on your own as well.

04:30:45.140 --> 04:30:49.140
Of course you have, and I've taken up too much of yours now.

04:30:49.140 --> 04:30:52.140
Wait, I think I'll be off. Okay, thanks.

04:30:57.140 --> 04:30:59.140
Goodbye Snuffkin.

04:30:59.140 --> 04:31:01.140
Good night, little fella.

04:31:01.140 --> 04:31:08.140
Hey, wait a minute. What about your name?

04:31:08.140 --> 04:31:10.140
You remembered!

04:31:10.140 --> 04:31:14.140
Well, what do you think of TD Wu, my friend?

04:31:14.140 --> 04:31:20.140
Yes, TD Wu. It's nice and happy to start with, and then a little sadness.

04:31:20.140 --> 04:31:22.140
TD Wu.

04:31:23.140 --> 04:31:26.140
That's right, TD Wu.

04:31:26.140 --> 04:31:29.140
TD Wu.

04:31:29.140 --> 04:31:32.140
TD Wu.

04:31:32.140 --> 04:31:34.140
TD Wu.

04:31:34.140 --> 04:31:36.140
TD Wu.

04:31:36.140 --> 04:31:38.140
TD Wu.

04:31:38.140 --> 04:31:40.140
TD Wu.

04:31:40.140 --> 04:31:42.140
TD Wu.

04:31:42.140 --> 04:31:44.140
TD Wu.

04:31:44.140 --> 04:31:46.140
TD Wu.

04:31:46.140 --> 04:31:50.140
Yeah, that's great. It's a wonderful name.

04:31:51.140 --> 04:31:56.140
TD Wu. I'm glad you like it. It's the first time I've ever given anyone a name.

04:31:59.140 --> 04:32:04.140
I think I'll be able to house, and then I can put up a real name plate that says TD Wu.

04:32:04.140 --> 04:32:07.140
Ah, good idea, TD Wu. About what I said before.

04:32:07.140 --> 04:32:08.140
Huh?

04:32:08.140 --> 04:32:14.140
You know, not going back to Moonman Valley? Well, I am. I've missed Moonman and all my friends.

04:32:14.140 --> 04:32:19.140
Oh, I didn't take that seriously. You just got upset at something, I said.

04:32:19.140 --> 04:32:22.140
I'm afraid that happens a lot, I guess I talk too much.

04:32:22.140 --> 04:32:24.140
Maybe you do.

04:32:24.140 --> 04:32:29.140
I'll be going back to Moonman Valley a bit behind schedule, and this year Spring came along early too.

04:32:29.140 --> 04:32:33.140
But I suppose it's better late than never, as they say.

04:32:33.140 --> 04:32:37.140
Moonman will be happy. Say hello to everyone from TD Wu.

04:32:37.140 --> 04:32:41.140
I will, and I'll tell them how it came about.

04:32:41.140 --> 04:32:46.140
That's where you keep your harmonica, isn't it, Snuffkin? It's really famous, you know?

04:32:46.140 --> 04:32:48.140
I didn't realize that.

04:32:48.140 --> 04:32:52.140
Do you know? I've never ever heard any music.

04:32:55.140 --> 04:32:57.140
Really? What would you like me to play?

04:32:57.140 --> 04:33:02.140
Anything. Oh, I know. What about Moonman's favorite?

04:33:18.140 --> 04:33:23.140
Oh, that's Snuffkin!

04:33:38.140 --> 04:33:41.140
Oh, that's Snuffkin!

04:33:48.140 --> 04:33:53.140
Don't move!

04:34:08.140 --> 04:34:12.140
Snuffkin!

04:34:18.140 --> 04:34:23.140
Snuffkin!

04:34:33.140 --> 04:34:39.140
Now at last, Spring really has come to Moonman Valley.

04:34:39.140 --> 04:34:46.140
They love the laughter, and they love the living, the movements.

04:34:46.140 --> 04:34:53.140
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:34:53.140 --> 04:34:57.140
They're always happy and always at play.

04:34:57.140 --> 04:35:04.140
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

04:35:04.140 --> 04:35:08.140
The movements.

04:35:08.140 --> 04:35:15.140
They love the laughter, and they love the living, the movements.

04:35:15.140 --> 04:35:22.140
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:35:22.140 --> 04:35:26.140
They're always happy and always at play.

04:35:26.140 --> 04:35:33.140
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

04:35:33.140 --> 04:35:38.140
The movements.

04:35:38.140 --> 04:35:43.140
The movements.

04:36:03.140 --> 04:36:06.140
Here they are for one and all.

04:36:06.140 --> 04:36:09.140
The movements are about to come.

04:36:09.140 --> 04:36:12.140
Come on and sit down here with me.

04:36:12.140 --> 04:36:17.140
They're here for you on your TV. They are the movements.

04:36:17.140 --> 04:36:20.140
They are the movements.

04:36:20.140 --> 04:36:23.140
So come with me, give me your hand.

04:36:23.140 --> 04:36:26.140
I'll take you up to Moonman Land.

04:36:26.140 --> 04:36:29.140
You can fly just like a bird.

04:36:29.140 --> 04:36:32.140
Sing that song ever.

04:36:32.140 --> 04:36:34.140
There were the movements.

04:36:34.140 --> 04:36:37.140
There were the movements.

04:36:37.140 --> 04:36:40.140
There were the movements.

04:36:40.140 --> 04:36:43.140
There were the movements.

04:36:43.140 --> 04:36:46.140
There were the movements.

04:36:46.140 --> 04:36:49.140
There were the movements.

04:36:59.140 --> 04:37:27.140
All is peaceful in Moonman Valley.

04:37:27.140 --> 04:37:30.140
Mama waters the flowers.

04:37:30.140 --> 04:37:34.140
While Papa relaxes in the shade on the porch.

04:37:34.140 --> 04:37:39.140
Look, Mama, Moonman Papa is sleeping again.

04:37:39.140 --> 04:37:41.140
He had a long nap yesterday.

04:37:41.140 --> 04:37:43.140
I think it must be the weather.

04:37:43.140 --> 04:37:45.140
Too hot and sunny for me.

04:37:45.140 --> 04:37:48.140
I wonder if he's worried about anything.

04:37:48.140 --> 04:37:53.140
You don't sleep if you're worried you do something about it.

04:37:53.140 --> 04:37:56.140
But Moonman Papa does have something on his mind.

04:37:56.140 --> 04:37:59.140
Although it doesn't keep him awake.

04:38:03.140 --> 04:38:07.140
He's having a nice dream as well.

04:38:08.140 --> 04:38:17.140
Mama waters the flowers.

04:38:17.140 --> 04:38:23.140
Mama waters the flowers.

04:38:23.140 --> 04:38:26.140
Oh, a lighthouse.

04:38:26.140 --> 04:38:27.140
That's it.

04:38:27.140 --> 04:38:29.140
Oh, oh, oh.

04:38:29.140 --> 04:38:32.140
That's it, a lighthouse.

04:38:32.140 --> 04:38:34.140
What about a lighthouse, Papa?

04:38:34.140 --> 04:38:36.140
We're going to visit one.

04:38:36.140 --> 04:38:37.140
Right now.

04:38:37.140 --> 04:38:40.140
Well, as soon as I find one, anyway.

04:38:40.140 --> 04:38:43.140
That should stop you being bored, Mama.

04:38:43.140 --> 04:38:45.140
Oh, I'm not really dear, but it would be nice.

04:38:45.140 --> 04:38:46.140
Yeah.

04:38:46.140 --> 04:38:48.140
Oh, I'm really excited.

04:38:48.140 --> 04:38:50.140
Just because it doesn't let me.

04:38:50.140 --> 04:38:52.140
Lovely water.

04:38:52.140 --> 04:38:56.140
Yeah, I'll write an exciting, epic novel of the sea.

04:38:56.140 --> 04:38:58.140
I'm sure it will be a great success.

04:38:58.140 --> 04:39:02.140
If he puts some action in it and misses out the romantic stuff.

04:39:07.140 --> 04:39:09.140
Stop it!

04:39:12.140 --> 04:39:14.140
Stop it!

04:39:14.140 --> 04:39:16.140
Stop it!

04:39:20.140 --> 04:39:21.140
Tell me.

04:39:21.140 --> 04:39:24.140
Does Moonman Papa want all of you to go away to this lighthouse?

04:39:24.140 --> 04:39:25.140
Oh, yes.

04:39:25.140 --> 04:39:26.140
It'll be great fun.

04:39:26.140 --> 04:39:28.140
Just think of all the ships we'll be able to see.

04:39:28.140 --> 04:39:30.140
Yes, that will be good.

04:39:30.140 --> 04:39:33.140
Papa says he wants to write an exciting story about the sea.

04:39:33.140 --> 04:39:37.140
With ships and storms and stuff, probably pirates too.

04:39:37.140 --> 04:39:40.140
Oh, he's stuck writing his memoirs again, is he?

04:39:40.140 --> 04:39:43.140
Well, I guess that might have something to do with it.

04:39:43.140 --> 04:39:45.140
But I think he just wants another adventure.

04:39:45.140 --> 04:39:46.140
He's bored.

04:39:46.140 --> 04:39:48.140
Well, it sounds a bit odd to me, Moonman.

04:39:48.140 --> 04:39:49.140
No, it's not.

04:39:49.140 --> 04:39:53.140
We're going to live in a real lighthouse and save ships from the rocks

04:39:53.140 --> 04:39:55.140
and being wrecked terrible storms.

04:39:55.140 --> 04:39:56.140
Oh, I see.

04:39:56.140 --> 04:39:59.140
What do you think the lighthouse keeper might say about you moving in?

04:39:59.140 --> 04:40:01.140
Oh, he won't mind at all.

04:40:01.140 --> 04:40:04.140
It'll be company for him, and I'm sure he'd like someone to talk to.

04:40:04.140 --> 04:40:07.140
Looking after a lighthouse is a very lonely job.

04:40:07.140 --> 04:40:12.140
Ah, but if you thought Moonman, that might be exactly why he chooses to do it.

04:40:12.140 --> 04:40:16.140
You mean that he might want to be on his own all the time?

04:40:16.140 --> 04:40:19.140
Well, some people like it like that.

04:40:19.140 --> 04:40:22.140
Sometimes I like being on my own.

04:40:22.140 --> 04:40:24.140
Not for long, though.

04:40:24.140 --> 04:40:26.140
It'll be a lot of fun.

04:40:26.140 --> 04:40:28.140
Snuffkin, why don't you come with us?

04:40:29.140 --> 04:40:31.140
What, to a lonely lighthouse?

04:40:31.140 --> 04:40:34.140
Yes.

04:40:34.140 --> 04:40:38.140
Ah, no, which one is it?

04:40:38.140 --> 04:40:40.140
There, that's the one.

04:40:40.140 --> 04:40:41.140
Where?

04:40:41.140 --> 04:40:44.140
So small, you can hardly see it.

04:40:44.140 --> 04:40:47.140
How long would it take us to get there, Moonman, Papa?

04:40:47.140 --> 04:40:49.140
A day or two, I should say.

04:40:49.140 --> 04:40:50.140
Depending on the window.

04:40:50.140 --> 04:40:51.140
But it looks so tiny.

04:40:51.140 --> 04:40:52.140
Oh, I don't know.

04:40:52.140 --> 04:40:54.140
Well, I think so.

04:40:54.140 --> 04:40:56.140
How do we know which one is which?

04:40:56.140 --> 04:40:59.140
Oh, don't you worry about that.

04:40:59.140 --> 04:41:02.140
I've got an old compass somewhere, and we've got the map.

04:41:02.140 --> 04:41:05.140
Then at night we'll be able to see the light itself.

04:41:05.140 --> 04:41:07.140
Anyway, an old sailor.

04:41:07.140 --> 04:41:08.140
An old sailor?

04:41:08.140 --> 04:41:10.140
Well, I'm not really that young.

04:41:10.140 --> 04:41:11.140
And an old sailor.

04:41:11.140 --> 04:41:12.140
Is this mutiny?

04:41:12.140 --> 04:41:15.140
Don't be stupid.

04:41:15.140 --> 04:41:17.140
How long do you think you'll want to stay, Papa?

04:41:17.140 --> 04:41:18.140
About a month.

04:41:18.140 --> 04:41:22.140
Oh, we'll need to take lots and lots of food, then.

04:41:22.140 --> 04:41:24.140
Well, bless me.

04:41:24.140 --> 04:41:25.140
I think that'll be enough, Mama.

04:41:25.140 --> 04:41:27.140
Surely there'll be somebody living there already.

04:41:27.140 --> 04:41:29.140
Don't be stupid, of course there is.

04:41:29.140 --> 04:41:31.140
A lighthouse must have a keeper.

04:41:31.140 --> 04:41:34.140
Yes, a man dedicated to the sea.

04:41:34.140 --> 04:41:36.140
Suffering loneliness and hardship.

04:41:36.140 --> 04:41:39.140
Saving countless lives with no regard for his own.

04:41:45.140 --> 04:41:47.140
Is that you, Sniff?

04:41:47.140 --> 04:41:49.140
Yes, hi, Mr. Hamilton.

04:41:49.140 --> 04:41:52.140
I thought you'd be busy packing for the trip to the lighthouse.

04:41:53.140 --> 04:41:55.140
No, well, I'm not going with them this time.

04:41:55.140 --> 04:41:57.140
I've decided to stay here.

04:41:57.140 --> 04:41:59.140
Oh, dear me, really?

04:41:59.140 --> 04:42:01.140
Sniff can said he was going.

04:42:01.140 --> 04:42:03.140
Well, I have something very important to do.

04:42:03.140 --> 04:42:04.140
Important?

04:42:04.140 --> 04:42:06.140
Sniff is just a big whip, that's all.

04:42:06.140 --> 04:42:08.140
Oh, shut up, little mind.

04:42:08.140 --> 04:42:09.140
Don't tell me to shut up.

04:42:09.140 --> 04:42:11.140
I don't listen to whims.

04:42:11.140 --> 04:42:14.140
Now, now children, no squabbling.

04:42:14.140 --> 04:42:16.140
It wouldn't be fair to the others.

04:42:16.140 --> 04:42:18.140
I'm not a very good swimmer.

04:42:18.140 --> 04:42:20.140
You mean if you fell and then we're drowning,

04:42:20.140 --> 04:42:22.140
and save you, don't fall in then.

04:42:22.140 --> 04:42:24.140
Anyway, you could hang on to an or something.

04:42:24.140 --> 04:42:26.140
What if it got swept away?

04:42:26.140 --> 04:42:29.140
We'll put a life jacket on you stupid, don't worry.

04:42:29.140 --> 04:42:30.140
What about the sharks?

04:42:30.140 --> 04:42:32.140
They might take a fancy to me.

04:42:32.140 --> 04:42:34.140
Wait a minute, I know I'm not as�ologist,

04:42:34.140 --> 04:42:36.140
but I don't think there are any sharks around here.

04:42:36.140 --> 04:42:38.140
I'm sure I would have heard if there were.

04:42:44.140 --> 04:42:47.140
Well, it's a real fine day for sailing.

04:42:47.140 --> 04:42:50.140
Where are mama and the others?

04:42:50.140 --> 04:42:53.140
Don't worry, movement, there's no hurry.

04:42:53.140 --> 04:42:55.140
Are you sure that isn't too heavy for you, Sniff?

04:42:55.140 --> 04:42:57.140
No, not at all, mama.

04:42:57.140 --> 04:42:59.140
It's a shame that you're not coming with us,

04:42:59.140 --> 04:43:01.140
but if you've got something important to do, you must do it.

04:43:01.140 --> 04:43:03.140
It won't be the same without you, though.

04:43:03.140 --> 04:43:05.140
We'll miss you, Sniff.

04:43:05.140 --> 04:43:06.140
Thank you.

04:43:06.140 --> 04:43:08.140
Oh, dear, I left a jar of strawberry jam

04:43:08.140 --> 04:43:11.140
and a whole batch of pancakes on the kitchen table.

04:43:11.140 --> 04:43:13.140
Do you think you could manage to eat them?

04:43:13.140 --> 04:43:14.140
Leave it to me.

04:43:15.140 --> 04:43:18.140
Hi, y'all be lucky if there's any food left in the lard or mama.

04:43:18.140 --> 04:43:19.140
He's a my.
