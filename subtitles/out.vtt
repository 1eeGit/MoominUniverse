00:00.000 --> 00:21.000

00:37.680 --> 00:45.040
like a bird sing that song ever there were the moments there were the

00:45.040 --> 00:58.880
moments there were the moments there was the moments

00:58.880 --> 01:28.880

01:58.880 --> 02:00.880
Mama! Mama!

02:00.880 --> 02:02.880
Are they ready?

02:02.880 --> 02:03.880
Are what ready?

02:03.880 --> 02:04.880
The pancakes!

02:04.880 --> 02:05.880
Not yet.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.880
This hobgoblin wood doesn't seem to burn very well.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.880
Aren't they cooking?

02:09.880 --> 02:10.880
They won't be long.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.880
Have some lemonade while you're waiting.

02:11.880 --> 02:12.880
Mama!

02:12.880 --> 02:14.880
Are the pancakes ready yet?

02:14.880 --> 02:15.880
Oh well.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.880
Everything seems normal in the movement house.

02:17.880 --> 02:18.880
Oh!

02:20.880 --> 02:21.880
I'm a dumbo.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.880
I'm a no-good, mean, good-boot, Ninny.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.880
No, you're not, Snork.

02:25.880 --> 02:26.880
You're very clever.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.880
I'm a failure of flop of frightful fraud and a misfit.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.880
But your landship was a success?

02:32.880 --> 02:34.880
Wasn't it?

02:34.880 --> 02:35.880
Kid stuff!

02:35.880 --> 02:38.880
Look, if you can make a ship that runs on land,

02:38.880 --> 02:40.880
then I'm sure you can make one that flies.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.880
I believe in you.

02:42.880 --> 02:46.880
Fatal out of good, that does me snort and maiden.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.880
You know, last night, I thought,

02:49.880 --> 02:53.880
I've done it, a flagship, then I looked at it again.

02:54.880 --> 02:55.880
No good, no good.

02:55.880 --> 02:56.880
It was all wrong.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.880
Wouldn't, couldn't fly at all.

02:58.880 --> 03:02.880
Oh, how can someone so intelligent be such an idiot?

03:02.880 --> 03:04.880
Oh dear, oh dear.

03:07.880 --> 03:08.880
Well, they're ready.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.880
Go and tell the others, little Mai.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.880
All right, move in, Mama.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.880
Where's Moomin and Snork Maiden?

03:14.880 --> 03:16.880
Snork Maiden's fallen again.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.880
Come on, Snork Maiden, cheer up.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.880
I'm sure Snork will get over it.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.880
Inventors always feel down in the dumps when something doesn't work.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.880
Does Moomin, Papa, do you think?

03:27.880 --> 03:30.880
He invents stories, doesn't he, Moomin?

03:30.880 --> 03:32.880
Well, where Moomin was, really?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.880
Snork Maiden, do you want some pancakes?

03:35.880 --> 03:37.880
Oh, yes, please, Moomin, Mama.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.880
Moomin, go and get Papa.

03:39.880 --> 03:42.880
I have a feeling he's writing his gut stuck again.

03:42.880 --> 03:43.880
Okay, Mama.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.880
Now, what's the matter, Snork Maiden?

03:48.880 --> 03:49.880
Hmm.

03:51.880 --> 03:54.880
Well, the sun returned to the eastern sky when morning came

03:54.880 --> 03:56.880
and everything started to get lighter and louder.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.880
Oh dear, everybody knows that.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.880
Even the stupidest retard of Rayleigh.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.880
I have absolutely no literary talent.

04:05.880 --> 04:09.880
I'm an ignoramus son, a literate dilatant, nor an illiterate idiot.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.880
It's high time I gave up writing, though.

04:13.880 --> 04:14.880
Yes?

04:15.880 --> 04:16.880
Papa?

04:16.880 --> 04:18.880
Yeah, what is it, Moomin?

04:19.880 --> 04:22.880
Uh, Mama said to tell you the pancakes are ready.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.880
Well, I can't stop now, I'm being creative.

04:25.880 --> 04:26.880
I'll eat later.

04:26.880 --> 04:27.880
Oh, really?

04:28.880 --> 04:29.880
Yes, anything else?

04:30.880 --> 04:33.880
Yeah, no, I thought you said something.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.880
Moomin, wait, I'm coming.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.880
That was really good, Moomin, Mama.

04:50.880 --> 04:51.880
I'm going out.

04:51.880 --> 04:52.880
I'm coming!

04:53.880 --> 04:54.880
No, you can't.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.880
Snuffkin and I are going on an adventure and it could be dangerous.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.880
Hi, Snuffkin!

05:05.880 --> 05:06.880
Hello, Moomin.

05:06.880 --> 05:07.880
Didn't think you were coming.

05:07.880 --> 05:08.880
Sorry, I'm late.

05:08.880 --> 05:09.880
What's that?

05:09.880 --> 05:10.880
A leaf boat.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.880
Look, it sails on the river just like a real one.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.880
I bet it goes all the way down to the sea.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.880
And maybe even to some foreign lands.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.880
Gosh, Snuffkin, I'd like to do that one day.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.880
Let's go then, shall we?

05:23.880 --> 05:27.880
Little Mai wanted to come, but I told her it was too dangerous.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.880
Hmm, perhaps that wasn't the best thing to say.

05:30.880 --> 05:31.880
Look!

05:31.880 --> 05:32.880
Where are you?

05:32.880 --> 05:33.880
Where are you?

05:33.880 --> 05:35.880
I brought these to you, Moomin.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.880
I thought they could use a bit of fun.

05:37.880 --> 05:38.880
I'm going out.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.880
Wait, where are you?

05:39.880 --> 05:41.880
I brought these to you, Moomin.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.880
I thought they could use a bit of fun.

05:43.880 --> 05:44.880
Wait, Moomin!

05:50.880 --> 05:53.880
Are we really going to climb up there?

05:53.880 --> 05:55.880
Look, I don't think we can all go.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.880
It'll just be Moomin and me.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.880
I'm not climbing up there.

05:59.880 --> 06:00.880
Well, I am.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.880
Wouldn't you like to keep me company instead?

06:03.880 --> 06:06.880
Look, there's a cave just a little bit further along this path.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.880
Why don't you two girls wait for us there?

06:08.880 --> 06:09.880
We won't be long.

06:09.880 --> 06:13.880
But if you can walk to it, why on earth climb to it?

06:13.880 --> 06:15.880
Ah, difficult for a girl to understand.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.880
Well, I think boys are difficult to understand.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.880
We're not sure we can reach it from above.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.880
Well, we'll soon find out.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.880
Are you coming with us, Snuff?

06:24.880 --> 06:26.880
Oh, I think I'll guard the rear.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.880
Protect the cave from below.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.880
Oh, yeah.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.880
Well, someone has to look after the girls.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.880
Someone responsible.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.880
Oh, my goodness, it's dark in there.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.880
Let's go in, then.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.880
I don't like the look of it.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.880
We'd better stay out here.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.880
I never know who might live in there.

07:05.880 --> 07:06.880
Don't be silly.

07:06.880 --> 07:07.880
No one lives in there.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.880
That's what I don't like.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.880
Yes, exactly a place with no one living in it is really scary.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.880
I think we must be right above the cave here.

07:19.880 --> 07:20.880
Maybe.

07:20.880 --> 07:22.880
I can't find the hole, though.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.880
Let's look a bit more over that way, moving.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.880
Wow, I've never seen a shell like this before.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.880
Oh, look at that one.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.880
They must be worth a fortune.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.880
Come over here and look, little mind.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.880
Where's little mind, Snork Maiden?

07:41.880 --> 07:43.880
She went into the cave, Snuff.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.880
Oh, no, she can't do that.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.880
It might be dangerous.

07:49.880 --> 07:53.880
Little mind, little mind, come out.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.880
No, you come in, scaredy cat.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.880
You can't just go in like that.

07:57.880 --> 07:58.880
You can't.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.880
So tell me, how would you go in there and Mr. Knove at all?

08:01.880 --> 08:03.880
Stay where you are.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.880
We'll rescue you.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.880
You're coming, too, aren't you, Snork Maiden?

08:08.880 --> 08:10.880
You can't stay here alone.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.880
I suppose so.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.880
Right then, let's go.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.880
Shall I hold your hand in case you get frightened?

08:18.880 --> 08:22.880
Little mind, where are you?

08:25.880 --> 08:26.880
Stop it, please.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.880
You're frightening Snork Maiden.

08:28.880 --> 08:29.880
Oh, really?

08:29.880 --> 08:31.880
I thought I was frightening you.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.880
Your voice is so shaky.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.880
This isn't the way I sound normally.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.880
Hey, be quiet.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.880
No.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.880
I can hear something.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.880
Me, too.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.880
Perhaps it's the wind.

08:46.880 --> 08:47.880
No, Snork Maiden.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.880
It sounds like someone moaning.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.880
You can't scare me like that.

08:51.880 --> 08:52.880
No one lives here.

08:52.880 --> 08:53.880
Who want to live here anyway?

08:53.880 --> 08:55.880
It's dark and cold.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.880
It's moment and snuffkin.

08:57.880 --> 09:00.880
They've climbed out and we can hear their voices in the distance.

09:00.880 --> 09:01.880
So we needn't worry.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.880
Why would they be moaning?

09:03.880 --> 09:05.880
No, it's not them.

09:05.880 --> 09:09.880
I'm gonna go and investigate.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.880
Don't, little mind.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.880
Please, please stop it.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.880
Pull hard, Moomin.

09:27.880 --> 09:29.880
Will this do?

09:29.880 --> 09:31.880
Right, who's going first?

09:31.880 --> 09:32.880
Me.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.880
Okay, but please be careful.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.880
I will.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.880
Take it easy, Moomin.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.880
There's no hurry.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.880
Hey, are you alright, Moomin?

10:01.880 --> 10:03.880
Yes, of course.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.880
Moomin.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.880
Help me!

10:25.880 --> 10:27.880
Moomin, what's happened?

10:27.880 --> 10:29.880
Talk to me.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.880
Moomin, are you alright?

10:31.880 --> 10:32.880
Oh, I don't know.

10:32.880 --> 10:33.880
I think so.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.880
My bottom's a little bit sore, though.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.880
I'm sure I heard somebody scream just now.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.880
Well, the Himmelin was down here, having a nap.

10:41.880 --> 10:42.880
The Himmelin?

10:42.880 --> 10:45.880
If this is another of your games, Moomin, I don't like it.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.880
Mr. Himmelin, we were climbing down from the top.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.880
We didn't know you were asleep.

10:49.880 --> 10:50.880
That's not quite right.

10:50.880 --> 10:51.880
I wasn't asleep.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.880
I wasn't at all comfortable, you know.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.880
Well, what were you doing here, then?

10:55.880 --> 11:00.880
Well, to tell you the truth, I really haven't been quite myself lately.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.880
You haven't lost any more rare stamps, have you, Mr. Himmelin?

11:04.880 --> 11:06.880
I'm a contrary, Moomin.

11:06.880 --> 11:07.880
I have them all.

11:07.880 --> 11:11.880
Even the rarest, every single one.

11:11.880 --> 11:12.880
Then, what's wrong?

11:12.880 --> 11:14.880
That's good, isn't it?

11:14.880 --> 11:17.880
I mean, my collection is complete.

11:17.880 --> 11:22.880
I know one in the world has a better stamp collection than you have, Mr. Himmelin.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.880
No, of course not mine is perfect.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.880
There isn't a stamp I haven't got.

11:26.880 --> 11:30.880
Rare ones, old ones, misprinted ones, I have them all.

11:30.880 --> 11:31.880
I still don't understand.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.880
There's no challenge, nothing to search for.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.880
You're too young and you don't collect stamps.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.880
Oh dear, me, dear me.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.880
I'm beginning to understand.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.880
He's not a collector anymore.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.880
He's got all the stamps he could ever want.

11:46.880 --> 11:47.880
That's the trouble.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.880
It's not half as much fun.

11:50.880 --> 11:54.880
That's why you're sad, isn't it, Mr. Himmelin?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.880
Yes, it is. No fun.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.880
No fun at all.

11:58.880 --> 11:59.880
No, I understand.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.880
I can see why you're upset.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.880
And me falling on top of you like that didn't really help, did it?

12:04.880 --> 12:08.880
Not exactly, Moomin.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.880
Look who was taking a nap in the cave.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.880
Oh, it's you, Mr. Himmelin.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.880
So it must have been his snoring that we heard.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.880
What a noise he was making.

12:19.880 --> 12:22.880
I'd never ever snore.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.880
You certainly do.

12:28.880 --> 12:32.880
Robbys, look, if you promise not to tell anyone

12:32.880 --> 12:35.880
I'll take you to see something very special.

12:35.880 --> 12:36.880
What is it?

12:39.880 --> 12:41.880
Oh, it's him!

12:41.880 --> 12:43.880
He's in a home!

12:43.880 --> 12:45.880
He's in a home!

12:45.880 --> 12:46.880
He's in a home!

12:46.880 --> 12:48.880
He's in a home!

12:48.880 --> 12:49.880
He's in a home!

12:49.880 --> 12:50.880
He's in a home!

12:50.880 --> 12:52.880
He's in a home!

12:52.880 --> 12:53.880
He's in a home!

12:53.880 --> 12:55.880
He's in a home!

12:55.880 --> 12:57.880
I think he could be repaired.

12:57.880 --> 12:58.880
Of course it could.

12:58.880 --> 12:59.880
Easy!

12:59.880 --> 13:01.880
But you know you can't always tell.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.880
The keel doesn't look too good.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.880
Yes, we could take it out to see a no-time.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.880
The sails got holes in it.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.880
Hey, I can't find any owners.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.880
You can paddle all-steer.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.880
Look out, friends! It's going over!

13:22.880 --> 13:24.880
Hey!

13:24.880 --> 13:26.880
Hang on, everybody.

13:31.880 --> 13:35.880
I've lost my confidence and it makes me feel very unhappy.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.880
Well, it can happen to anyone, you know.

13:38.880 --> 13:39.880
Even to you?

13:39.880 --> 13:41.880
Well, not much, of course.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.880
Lucky you. I just don't know what to do.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.880
How can I get it back? There must be a way.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.880
It's hard to say.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.880
Everybody's different, but with me, it just happens.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.880
I don't think I'll ever invent anything again.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.880
Perhaps I'll have a break from my memoirs, too.

14:04.880 --> 14:05.880
Tea time?

14:05.880 --> 14:07.880
Oh, dear. What's the matter with you, too?

14:07.880 --> 14:09.880
You look a bit down in the dumps.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.880
You know I might have been a bit overconfident.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.880
Me, too, I think.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.880
Oh, hi there!

14:20.880 --> 14:21.880
Mum and Mama!

14:21.880 --> 14:22.880
Mum and Papa!

14:22.880 --> 14:24.880
There's no need to yell.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.880
We can hear you. Watch the matter, Sniff.

14:27.880 --> 14:31.880
We found a boat on the beach. Come and have a look.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.880
A shipwreck washed up on the shore.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.880
It's not a wreck, and it's got a white sail.

14:36.880 --> 14:37.880
Oh.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.880
We're going to repair it, and then it'll be ours.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.880
All right, I'm coming.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.880
Come on, Snort. Let's take a look at this boat.

14:45.880 --> 14:47.880
It could be just the thing to cheer us both up.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.880
So, it's got a sail. A white sail, you say.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.880
That could be extremely interesting.

14:56.880 --> 14:59.880
It's a sturdy little craft. It's nicely built.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.880
Well designed.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.880
She's abandoned. So does that mean we can keep her?

15:10.880 --> 15:14.880
It seems to be in pretty good condition except for the hole in the bottom.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.880
You know, maybe that's why she was abandoned here.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.880
You could be right, Sniffkin.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.880
Finders keepers, you guys. Of course it makes it our boat.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.880
You'd have to wait to see if anyone claims it first, little mind.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.880
What shall we do then, Papa?

15:28.880 --> 15:31.880
Well, first things first, we must repair the hole,

15:31.880 --> 15:35.880
and then tire up securely in case there's a storm.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.880
Absolutely.

15:37.880 --> 15:41.880
Then if the owner comes, we ought to give her back to him.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.880
Mind you, she might know she's here.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.880
So, what are we going to do when we've repaired her?

15:49.880 --> 15:54.880
It's bad for boats not to be yours, but we could sail the seven seas.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.880
Yay!

15:58.880 --> 16:01.880
I'd be happy just to explore around here.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.880
Don't worry, Snort Maiden.

16:03.880 --> 16:07.880
If we get big waves, we can sail between them, isn't that right, Mum and Papa?

16:07.880 --> 16:12.880
Well, in a way. Come on, let's get to work.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.880
How about you, Snort? Will you help us?

16:15.880 --> 16:17.880
Yes, of course.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.880
Can I do anything for you, Mum and Papa?

16:20.880 --> 16:22.880
Yes, if you'd like to, Mr. Himmelon.

16:22.880 --> 16:26.880
Well, I'm afraid I'm not much of a builder, but if there is something I could do.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.880
Well, let's get her out of the water first, shall we?

16:29.880 --> 16:31.880
Yes, Mum!

16:31.880 --> 16:35.880
And we'll need some big logs to go under her.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.880
I think ten should be enough.

16:37.880 --> 16:40.880
I'll be ten some. Let's go, prom!

16:40.880 --> 16:46.880
Yes, you'll need to be safe to work on, so we'll want something strong to keep her upright as well.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.880
And lots of tools.

16:49.880 --> 16:53.880
I'll go home and get some, and I think we'll need a bucket and a shovel.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.880
I'll come with you and help you choose.

16:56.880 --> 17:01.880
Yes, you go. I'll stay and keep guard in case the owner comes back.

17:19.880 --> 17:26.880
Sleep well.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.880
Man, the top sales.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.880
What?

17:45.880 --> 17:47.880
Are they all in bed, my dear?

17:47.880 --> 17:49.880
Yes, dear. Sleeping like logs.

17:49.880 --> 17:53.880
I'm not surprised. They all work very, very hard today.

17:53.880 --> 17:57.880
I can't wait until the boat's ready, and we can sail off somewhere.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.880
My dear, we'll go anywhere in the world you like.

18:00.880 --> 18:04.880
Anywhere at all you've only got to say and off will Jolly will go.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.880
It doesn't have to be far, dear.

18:06.880 --> 18:10.880
Let's get to bed, too. We've got an early start of the morning.

18:10.880 --> 18:15.880
Oh! Intellectuals like me aren't used to this artwork.

18:16.880 --> 18:19.880
Oh, I'm tired out, and I can hardly move.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.880
Mama, I'd better put these tired legs to bed.

18:21.880 --> 18:25.880
Good night, dear moment, Papa. This will be good for him, I think.

18:25.880 --> 18:31.880
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

18:31.880 --> 18:34.880
A perfect fit, if I may say so.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.880
Yeah, well, now for the rest of her.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.880
Right.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.880
Look at me, Moomin. I'm doing the Tari.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.880
I know, little Mai. I'm only doing where you can't reach.

18:53.880 --> 18:57.880
Oh, all right, then. Sniff you lazy land lover. Bring me some more Tari.

18:57.880 --> 19:02.880
No, I won't. Get it yourself, you lazy thing. You wanted to do it.

19:02.880 --> 19:06.880
I didn't want to carry Tari, though. And anyway, I'm the painter.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.880
Come on, hurry up.

19:10.880 --> 19:15.880
Moomin, Mama, should I cut it all out?

19:15.880 --> 19:18.880
Yes, please, not me.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.880
Hey, feeling all right, Mr. Hemmielin?

19:33.880 --> 19:36.880
Yes, thank you. You're fixing the boat very quickly.

19:36.880 --> 19:39.880
Yeah, we sure are, should be finished very soon.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.880
Yes, I'm sure it will.

19:42.880 --> 19:46.880
That's what I was afraid of. What shall I do then, Sniffkin?

19:46.880 --> 19:49.880
Well, maybe you could start collecting something else. What do you think?

19:49.880 --> 19:51.880
Something else, like what?

19:51.880 --> 19:54.880
Well, I don't know. Anything, really?

19:54.880 --> 19:55.880
How about butterflies?

19:55.880 --> 19:59.880
No, my second cousin does that, and he's a complete idiot.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.880
It has to be something interesting. Ornumans?

20:02.880 --> 20:03.880
Ornumans?

20:03.880 --> 20:06.880
Yeah, you could collect those forever. Not scientific.

20:06.880 --> 20:11.880
Well, it's up to you, but I think you really ought to collect something, Mr. Hemmielin.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.880
Mama! Mama!

20:22.880 --> 20:25.880
Mama, quick, hurry up. We're going to launch the new boat.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.880
All right, wait for me. I'm coming.

20:28.880 --> 20:32.880
The sail you men had is perfect, Mama. Come on.

20:33.880 --> 20:37.880
Are you ready, everybody? I'll count to three and then push as hard as you can.

20:37.880 --> 20:40.880
One, two, three!

20:56.880 --> 21:00.880
And so, with their new boat finally repaired and uncleaned,

21:00.880 --> 21:05.880
Moomin and the others began to get very excited about their trip from the world.

21:05.880 --> 21:09.880
Even Snork and Mr. Hemmielin were in unusually high spirits.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.880
All aboard for a trial run.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.880
I've decided what I'm going to collect.

21:18.880 --> 21:24.880
Flowers, look, here's my first sample. It's a sweet fryer, Rosa Rubiconosa.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.880
That's great. Good for you.

21:27.880 --> 21:32.880
Snork, maiden. I've just had a new idea for my flying ship.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.880
I'm certain it'll work this time.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.880
Of course it will, Snork. Good luck.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.880
I'd better get on. All right, start paddling, everyone.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.880
We'll be back soon, my dear, Moomin Mama.

21:45.880 --> 21:50.880
Take as long as you like, Papa. I'll prepare something cold for when you get back.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.880
One, two, one, two.

21:53.880 --> 21:58.880
The way, the way, the deep blue yonder.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.880
One, two, one, two.

22:07.880 --> 22:14.880
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:14.880 --> 22:21.880
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:21.880 --> 22:25.880
They're always happy and always at play.

22:25.880 --> 22:32.880
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

22:32.880 --> 22:36.880
The movements.

22:36.880 --> 22:43.880
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:43.880 --> 22:50.880
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:50.880 --> 22:55.880
They're always happy and always at play.

22:55.880 --> 23:02.880
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.880
The movements.

23:06.880 --> 23:12.880
The movements.
