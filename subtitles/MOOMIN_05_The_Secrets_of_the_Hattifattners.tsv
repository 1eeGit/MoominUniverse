118920	123840	papa, I think that rope is getting loose. Okay momen, you'd better have a look before this wind has the whole tent down.
123840	127560	me yes captain
127560	130560	The sudden storm has hit the hafifat in his island.
136560	140560	Moomin Papa has decided that it would be far safer to stay the night on the island,
140560	143560	so they put up the tent and moored the boat.
154560	156560	This will show us what the weather's up to.
156560	158560	That's as long as it's still working.
158560	161560	I'm sure it's going to die down really soon.
161560	163560	Oh, wake up, Mr. Hemelon.
163560	168560	When the storm clears, we must give this barometer straight back to the hafifatness.
168560	173560	Oh, I quite fancy keeping it myself to remind me of the island.
173560	175560	You know, it seems to work after all.
175560	180560	But Mr. Hemelon, that'll only remind you of the horrible hafifatness.
180560	182560	What about all the tons of plants you've found?
182560	185560	That surely is going to be enough?
185560	190560	Yes, I know, but there was only really one special flower amongst all those plants,
190560	192560	and I nearly missed that one.
192560	194560	Look, isn't it a beauty?
194560	197560	I discovered it as I was about to tie up the boat.
197560	199560	Oh, Moomin Papa.
199560	201560	Yes, Mr. Hemelon.
201560	208560	You know when you all went to put up the tent, you told me to tie up the boat so she was safe.
208560	210560	Yes, of course.
210560	212560	Well, I'm not sure if I did.
212560	215560	Not sure at all.
215560	218560	Please try to remember Mr. Hemelon.
218560	222560	I can't, it's all very unclear in my mind.
222560	226560	If the boat's not here, we'll be stuck on the island forever and ever.
226560	232560	Well, we pulled it well ashore so it should be okay, but we'd better check on it as soon as we can.
232560	234560	I'll go have a look.
234560	237560	Quickly, Moomin, be careful.
238560	242560	I remember I was just going to do it when I spotted this flower.
242560	245560	Just by a rocket was whole dear.
247560	249560	Moomin.
262560	264560	Boy, that was close.
265560	268560	Tie it to the tree and make sure it's tight.
269560	271560	Oh, that should do it.
271560	273560	Just in time.
273560	276560	You know the waves must have been huge to reach this far.
276560	278560	Well, we saved the boat.
278560	280560	Yes.
281560	284560	Well, this storm will be over soon.
290560	292560	Is everything okay?
292560	294560	Yep, everything's fine.
294560	298560	Oh, thank goodness, so we're not stranded after all.
298560	300560	Huh? No.
300560	302560	We needn't have worried.
302560	306560	I'm very sorry, really I am.
306560	309560	Are you alright, Snort Maiden?
309560	311560	Now I am.
322560	331560	According to this, the storm is blowing over now and it should stop raining soon.
331560	333560	Well, the wind seems to have dropped.
333560	337560	Oh, good. All that thunder and lightning is so noisy.
337560	343560	Ah, right. I think I'll just go for a bit of a walk before I settle down for the night.
343560	346560	But it's much too dark to see anything.
346560	349560	The fresh air will do me good.
350560	354560	Oh, that's a good idea.
354560	357560	I could do with some fresh air myself.
357560	359560	Wait for me. I'll come too.
359560	361560	Let me increase the water.
361560	365560	There's still there hundreds of them all glowing.
365560	367560	The Hattie Fat News.
367560	369560	They're waiting for us.
370560	380560	The lightning must have recharged them.
380560	386560	Look at them all. I wonder what they want, Snort Maiden.
386560	390560	Such a heavy storm would have given them lots and lots of energy.
390560	392560	Gosh, they're ready for anything.
392560	395560	They're not coming any closer.
395560	398560	They seem fairly friendly. Maybe they just want to see what we look like.
398560	400560	No, I know what they're here for.
400560	402560	Oh, what's that, Snuffkin?
402560	404560	It's their barometer, Moomin Papa.
404560	409560	They know we've got it and they've come to get it back from us.
409560	412560	Yes, I think you're right, Snuffkin.
412560	414560	Mr. Hamilton?
414560	417560	I do think you'd better give it back to them.
417560	419560	Do I have to?
419560	426560	Yes, of course. After all it is there isn't there are a lot of them.
426560	431560	Look, why don't you take it out to them now?
434560	438560	You know the barometer does belong to the Mr. Hamilton.
438560	440560	Oh, dear, dear.
440560	443560	Give it to me.
443560	445560	Let me do it, Papa.
445560	449560	Well done, my boy.
449560	451560	You must be careful, my dear.
451560	453560	Don't worry, Mama.
453560	456560	Boy, isn't he brave?
479560	482560	I think this is what you've come for.
483560	486560	Here you are. You can have it back now.
497560	499560	Moomin!
500560	504560	Moomin! Are you all right, Moomin?
504560	506560	I'll tell you something.
506560	509560	I'm real glad there's no electricity where we live.
509560	513560	Oh, they didn't hurt you, did they?
513560	515560	Ah! Go away!
515560	517560	They were alone.
519560	521560	Are you all right, Moomin?
521560	523560	I'll tell you something.
523560	526560	I'm real glad there's no electricity where we live.
526560	528560	Oh, they didn't hurt you, did they?
528560	530400	Are you all right, Snorgmaiden?
530400	531760	What did he do to you?
531760	534200	Just a bit of shock, that's all.
535200	536880	What's that funny smell?
536880	537880	Huh.
539520	541080	Oh my god, it's your hair.
541080	542080	What?
543000	545240	What do you mean?
545960	547760	What's happened to it?
547760	548720	Oh no, my hair.
548720	550520	Mama, mama!
550520	551760	Where's your mirror?
551760	552640	Oh, mama.
552640	556360	Oh, look at what those wicked, hatty fat nurse have done.
558560	561080	It's here in my handbag somewhere.
561080	562280	Hurry, mama!
562280	564560	I must see what's happened to my hair.
564560	565800	Here you are, dear.
567240	568440	Look at me!
568440	569840	Look at me!
569840	571040	It's awful!
572840	573840	It's horrible!
573840	574600	It's horrible!
574600	576840	Don't worry, we'll put some magic ointment on
576840	579000	and it'll come back all lovely and curly.
579000	581520	I don't want nasty curly hair.
581520	585280	I want my long, beautiful hair like it was before.
585440	589760	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
589760	593280	Do you know it really doesn't matter to me, Snort Major?
593280	598640	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
598640	599520	Gun.
599520	600360	Oh, good.
600360	603680	I hope that's the last we see of them.
603680	606440	Oh dear, what's happened to Snort Major?
606440	626440	My hair, my hair, where's my hair?
626440	631440	My hair, my hair, where's my hair?
656440	666440	My hair, my hair.
686440	701440	Wake up, woman. We got hurry.
717440	721440	My wonder where they're going.
721440	724440	Perhaps they're sailing away to a secret island.
724440	732440	Somewhere very far away from here where they can live happily on their own together.
732440	735440	Gosh, napkin, they're really weird.
735440	738440	Well, it depends on how you look at a woman.
738440	745440	They probably think we're a bit strange, too.
752440	756440	Snuffkin, you're really horrible. You knew I wanted to see them.
756440	759440	Come on, you were fast asleep snoring your head off.
759440	763440	That wasn't me snoring. That was Mr. Himulin.
763440	766440	All right. If you say so.
766440	769440	Well, I hope that's the last I'll see of them.
769440	773440	Me, too. That's a very pretty scarf snort made of.
773440	775440	Yes, it is, isn't it?
775440	777440	Can we go exploring, Mama?
777440	779440	I don't see why not.
779440	782440	It looks as though it'll be a nice day,
782440	786440	and there'll be lots of exciting things washed up by the storm.
786440	790440	Oh, that'll be fun. Let's look for the other side of the island.
790440	794440	What a good idea. I might discover some more plants.
796440	803440	Mr. Himulin, hurry up, sir, or it will be dark before we get there.
803440	808440	Ah, you go on, Momen. I just want to have a better look at these flowers.
808440	811440	Yes, all right.
811440	816440	Very interesting.
816440	820440	Just think.
821440	825440	Very interesting.
825440	830440	Just think. We could find all sorts of things lying on the sand.
830440	832440	I hope in secret, sunken treasure.
832440	835440	Well, let's hope it's not sunken anymore.
835440	839440	I expect there'll be lots and lots of treasures from shipwrecks and things like that.
839440	842440	But I find it before you.
842440	845440	Oh, no, you won't.
850440	853440	Look at all this. It's all mine.
853440	857440	I'm going to dive in.
857440	860440	What's that over there?
860440	863440	It's quite shallow right here.
863440	866440	Well, there must be something admit it.
866440	868440	Oh, dear, it's empty.
868440	872440	I think I found something here.
875440	877440	Little lie, little lie.
877440	879440	What's a matter?
880440	883440	Come and see these beautiful shells I have.
883440	887440	I'm too busy hunting for treasure to bother with shells.
895440	898440	Hey, what's this?
904440	906440	Oh, look at this one.
906440	908440	I've got a real collection here.
908440	911440	Lovely and mama's garden.
916440	919440	Wow, watch that.
919440	921440	What?
921440	924440	I can't find any as nice as yours.
924440	927440	Don't be in such an awful hurry, little lie.
927440	929440	Snark maiden!
929440	932440	Snark maiden! Look! Look what I found.
932440	934440	A proper treasure.
934440	937440	Look!
938440	942440	Oh, there's snow inside of it.
942440	945440	I found it in a cave.
945440	948440	What is it?
948440	950440	What's this?
950440	952440	It's a ship telescope.
952440	954440	You can see for miles with it.
954440	956440	I'll give it to Papa.
956440	960440	It's better than anything I got.
960440	964440	Hey, everybody, I found something.
964440	966440	Come on up and have a look.
966440	969440	I wish I could find something interesting.
973440	976440	Have you found some buried treasure?
981440	984440	What a big lady. Is she dead?
984440	986440	It's made of wood, Snark maiden.
986440	989440	It's a figurehead from a ship.
997440	1002440	She's like a queen.
1002440	1006440	Ha, she hasn't got any legs, though.
1006440	1010440	Why don't we put her on the front of our boat?
1010440	1012440	Nah, it's much too heavy.
1012440	1015440	It must have come from a ship that was wrecked.
1015440	1018440	And sank and sea?
1018440	1021440	Perhaps it did.
1021440	1023440	And all hands were lost.
1023440	1026440	I want to take it home.
1026440	1028440	What would you do with it?
1028440	1033440	Use it to frighten people away.
1033440	1037440	Help! Somebody help me, please!
1037440	1039440	That's old, Mr. Hamilton.
1039440	1042440	Gosh, I hope it's not more haddy fattiners.
1042440	1044440	Someone help, please!
1044440	1047440	We're coming!
1054440	1058440	Woman, why do you like this old figurehead so much?
1058440	1060440	You're staring at her.
1060440	1062440	She's not all that special, you know?
1062440	1064440	Yes, I know.
1064440	1068440	She's not even real. Only made of wood.
1068440	1069440	Ah.
1069440	1072440	Do you like her eyes?
1072440	1074440	Or is it her hair?
1074440	1077440	Just because I haven't got any?
1077440	1079440	Nearly there, just a bit further.
1079440	1081440	Come on, snuff it for me.
1082440	1084440	For her, if you want.
1086440	1089440	You're very heavy, Mr. Hamilton.
1091440	1094440	Thank you, snuff kid. You saved my life.
1096440	1099440	Boy, how'd you end up there, Mr. Hamilton?
1099440	1103440	One minute, I was looking for plants the next I'd fall and right into that hole.
1103440	1107440	I think you'd be safe for collecting stamps, Mr. Hamilton.
1107440	1110440	Oh no, it's not here. Where is it?
1111440	1113440	What is it now?
1113440	1116440	Tell me.
1116440	1118440	Make a move and preserve me.
1118440	1122440	Calm down, Mr. Hamilton. Tell me what's the matter?
1122440	1126440	My sample box, my sample box. Oh my goodness.
1126440	1128440	You didn't leave it in the hole, did you?
1128440	1132440	Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you. Oh dear.
1132440	1137440	All my precious samples, I'm so silly. Oh, snuff kid.
1137440	1141440	Oh, snuff kid, would you mind?
1141440	1144440	Okay, anything for some peace.
1144440	1146440	Oh dear boy, you are wonderful.
1146440	1149440	You shall have one of my rarest plants as a reward.
1149440	1153440	And indeed you shall, I shall choose a magnificent one for you.
1153440	1155440	Thank you very much, Mr. Hamilton.
1155440	1157440	Gosh, your one-room movement is.
1160440	1163440	Oh, there you are. What have you been up to?
1163440	1166440	He can't take his eyes off that silly wooden lady.
1166440	1168440	He just stares at her.
1168440	1169440	Really?
1169440	1173440	I do not. I just think she has a very beautiful face.
1173440	1178440	Well, woman, now that you're here, I could really do with your help.
1178440	1180440	What do you want, snuff kid?
1180440	1184440	Mr. Hamilton dropped his box of samples down this hole and I'm going to try and get it.
1184440	1189440	I didn't drop it. I fell in the hole and just forgot it when Stuffkin pulled me out.
1189440	1191440	You're a bit absent-minded, Mr. Hamilton.
1191440	1196440	No, I'm not. I can remember every Latin name of every single plant, you know.
1196440	1200440	Okay, I'll go down, woman, but you'll have to help me get back up.
1200440	1201440	Okay.
1201440	1206440	I'll help you too. Now be careful. Can you see it yet, Snuffkin?
1206440	1208440	I'm not down at the bottom yet.
1208440	1210440	Oh, forgive me. I'm sorry.
1210440	1212440	I found it.
1212440	1216440	Wonderful. Tell me, are the plants all right?
1216440	1219440	You can check them yourself in a minute.
1222440	1225440	Oh.
1225440	1227440	Are you all right, Snuffkin?
1227440	1232440	Wait a minute. I found something else.
1232440	1238440	Oh, look. There's the boat. It's moment, moment, moment, Papa.
1238440	1241440	Hello.
1245440	1246440	It's gold.
1246440	1249440	Hello. We've been hunting treasure.
1252440	1255440	Go and get movement, Papa. I found gold.
1255440	1258440	Boy, oh, boy, I wonder how much there is.
1258440	1260440	Moomin, Papa, we'll know.
1269440	1273440	Well, Moomin, Papa, what should we do with all this beautiful gold?
1273440	1276440	It would look lovely in the garden, don't you think?
1276440	1281440	With all the shells that the snorkemaiden found, they'll look over it in amongst the roses.
1281440	1283440	What do you think, Mama?
1283440	1285440	I'm sure they will, Papa.
1285440	1287440	I'm sure they will.
1291440	1294440	Moomin, she's only a stupid, legless doll.
1294440	1297440	You can have my bowl full of snorkemaiden.
1297440	1299440	No, thanks.
1299440	1303440	Well, I'll look after it for you. I can pretend it's my treasure.
1303440	1305440	Oh.
1307440	1313440	And that was the end of their first adventure in the new boat.
1313440	1319440	Moomin, Papa, decided that it was much more fun to set off without maps and sea charts.
1319440	1322440	You never know where you might end up.
1327440	1334440	They love the laughter and they love the living, the moments.
1334440	1341440	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1341440	1345440	They're always happy and always at play.
1345440	1349440	The movements are having fun day after day.
1349440	1352440	The movements.
1352440	1356440	The movements.
1356440	1363440	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1364440	1371440	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1371440	1375440	They're always happy and always at play.
1375440	1379440	The movements are having fun day after day.
1379440	1382440	The movements.
1382440	1386440	The movements.
1386440	1392440	The movements.
1394440	1399440	The movements.
