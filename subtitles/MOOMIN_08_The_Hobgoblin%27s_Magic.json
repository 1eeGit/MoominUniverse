{"text": " here they are for one and all the moments are about to come on and sit down here with me here for you on your TV they are the moments they are the moments so come with me give me your hand I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments there you are oops we weren't looking where we were going that's all right thank you think of me are you going out yes for a walk we'll have fun it seems that thingamy and bob are well and truly part of movement house now luckily they don't eat a lot and are small enough to find the pencils that fall between the floorboards in the porch hey this looks like a great hiding place nobody would ever find it here come on bob let's go get the suitcase man are you sure it's not safe for an arm what would you say someone went in when we went there you wouldn't like it would you I think the movements are much too nice to do anything like that it's not them it's the guess I'm thinking about you know the movements let anybody stay snorke maiden you lied to me little my homie moment still has the shell that I gave him but you said that he didn't impossible movement mama gave it to the grove I was there when she did it look I saw it he showed it to me are you really sure was it the same one of course it was I'm not stupid you know that's very odd I saw her do it with my own eyes well I'll go and ask moving right now little my it's a bit awkward but if I'm going to be honest snorke maiden what well I've decided that from now on I'm only going to tell the truth oh yes and I found something you might be interested in what is it mumble and I were down on the beach yesterday and you remember all those things we found washed up by the storm do you mean on the hatty fatter's island that we sailed to yes and do you remember the figurehead that movement like best of all you know the lady made of wood and painted she was really lovely wasn't she yes I remember movement wanted to keep it so what about it well it's here on the beach it was still the same as beautiful as ever we said the same one yes I remember her pretty face don't legs though she's just a silly wooden doll oh I know that but she's got those gorgeous eyes and lovely long hair little my why all this fuss about this silly figurehead trust him only someone as stupid as movement could fall in love with a figurehead it's probably still dreaming about her every night do you think it's still there Jars snorke maiden if no one else has found her already do you think the ocean might come and wash her away again why all these silly questions snorke maiden woman would go and rescue her if he knew so that would be terrible I couldn't bear it at all I really couldn't how pathetic he'll probably take her home and keep her in his room forever my expect she's too big to go through the door he'll just sit and stare at her with that lovesick look on his face I know he will oh where are you going now I thought you were going to move in house I was but there's something more important I have to do okay it's clear hey you two you're not leaving are you no we're just uh we're going why have you got the suitcase them look woman would you help us with something of course thank you very much woman oh that's okay it's a bit too big for you to carry we can take it from here it's all right it's not very heavy oh silly me it wouldn't be a very secret place if I'd seen it would it I'll see you later don't be too long now of course I won't hey what are you doing up there little my I'm coming down what does it look like you're much too small to do that the rungs are too far apart for you to reach just you watch me movement I have a problem do you mind if I ask you something go ahead did movement mama give snorke means heart shape shell to the grove yes she did so you and the grove can't both have it can you that's just where you're wrong but that's simply impossible you can't have the grove simply got another one that's not true all right but it would only upset snorke made an if she knew so I'm not going to tell her you rotten thing why don't you just tell me the truth because it's a secret but I want to know movement look movement now why don't you tell me your secret and then I'll tell you mine what is it really very top secret go on then tell me tell me yours first no you tell me first I know let's say them together all right ready one two three after we go and I went to the beach yesterday I'm out there we'll make you like it what did you say the figure head by the K wait a minute you didn't finish telling me your secret I'll tell you later that's not there you've got to tell me now what do you think moments to let I don't know maybe he's looking for shells again I don't think so he looks a bit worried to me maybe he's lost something important how much further do we have to go as far as you can road where a long way out already I know I want to make sure that the lady will never turn up again we must go further out we must be far enough by now I'm tired no the currents could still drag her in from here keep going he looks very unhappy we've got to cheer him up but how is only one way Bob yet you're right thing to me hello look so sad moment that we thought we try make you happy again you don't mind do you know but you don't have to I'm all right really how about this then moment we're going to show you what's in our suitcase would you like that moment it's very interesting oh my gosh will you do you need some help in

beautiful ruby how it changed color from soft red to sapphire blue and then to pink one minute it was like a flame leaping out of the center then suddenly it was like a blood tulip it was perhaps that's the king's ruby it was just beautiful that's the one the hob goblin the searching for oh no however far away is he'll come back on his black panther looking for it and he's sure to find it because he'll know that thing of me and Bob have it first the groke and allow the hob goblin what are we going to do no more than a week later and like a bolt from the blue a real catastrophe hit
