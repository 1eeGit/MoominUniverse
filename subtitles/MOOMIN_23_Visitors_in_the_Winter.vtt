WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.560
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with

00:20.560 --> 00:32.720
me here for you on your TV they are the movements they are the movements so come with me give me your hand

00:32.720 --> 00:41.280
I'll take you up to a movement land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there

00:41.280 --> 00:56.720
with the movements there was the movements there was the movements

01:11.280 --> 01:30.000
I'll take you up to a movement land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there

01:30.000 --> 01:45.280
during the long winter in movement valley almost everybody living there hibernates until the sunshine

01:45.280 --> 01:53.680
comes again in the spring but for some reason movement and little my woke up in the middle of it

01:53.680 --> 02:01.360
we couldn't get back to sleep ah this is great I'm really starving I hope there's lots

02:01.360 --> 02:06.640
oh there's plenty left no one thought she'd made too much this year but it's lucky for us she did

02:06.640 --> 02:08.560
I don't know what we'd have to eat otherwise

02:08.560 --> 02:21.360
shh they're still sleeping well at least you got me to play with movement

02:21.360 --> 02:46.320
and that was fun what are you ever going to move in I'm probably a bit heavy for it so get

02:46.320 --> 02:53.360
something else dummy I might later anyway I thought we were going to see tuteki come on I'll pull you okay

02:58.720 --> 03:03.600
I know why you don't want to go move in you're scared of sliding down from the top aren't you

03:03.680 --> 03:06.800
no of course I'm not

03:13.760 --> 03:21.200
tuteki's not here I wonder where she's gone to that's her over there isn't it oh yeah I think it is

03:22.640 --> 03:28.960
jay movement she looks like she's sliding sliding yes it's obvious she's sliding of course

03:29.760 --> 03:38.000
she's coming over what were you going out there tuteki watching the sun go down

03:38.720 --> 03:43.280
it's the only place you can see it from I just caught it for it disappeared over the horizon

03:43.280 --> 03:48.480
where did it go to it comes up again in the south and we'll probably shine on snuff can

03:48.480 --> 03:53.120
hey tuteki what are those things you got on your feet they're called skates and they're the

03:53.120 --> 03:58.880
best thing possible for moving across the ice quickly just what I need come on show me how to do

03:58.880 --> 04:09.200
it yes okay that's great I'm going to make myself some skates too it's not as easy as you think

04:09.200 --> 04:14.800
little lie pathetic I need a sort of knife on your shoes and that sounds easy enough to me

04:14.880 --> 04:24.720
you know it's strange but I've got a funny kind of feeling that there's someone else apart

04:24.720 --> 04:32.640
from us in the bathhouse well there is who is it where are they little my you can't see them

04:33.280 --> 04:39.440
huh what do you mean I can't see them where are they hiding in the cupboard no they're invisible look

04:39.440 --> 04:53.920
I'll show you see that's two of the shoe mice there are eight of them all together now don't

04:53.920 --> 05:03.280
walk on the line I didn't see any shoe mice here in the summer although if they're invisible I

05:03.280 --> 05:09.040
wouldn't have done no probably not as in the summer when we come across new little animals that

05:09.040 --> 05:15.520
we've never seen before and who likes snuffkin go away when the wind and snow comes then when the

05:15.520 --> 05:22.080
days are shorter and everyone else is hibernating they come out and some are so shy they're invisible

05:22.080 --> 05:27.680
and there I'm afraid I don't understand winter at all well of course you don't you moments have

05:27.680 --> 05:32.800
always slept through and don't know very much about it oh I can't wait to tell mummer and

05:32.800 --> 05:35.360

05:41.280 --> 05:49.360

05:49.360 --> 05:55.840
go on sleeping and sleeping until spring well we woke up today so but we don't know about tomorrow

05:55.840 --> 06:01.120
no of course not we'll have to wait and see if we're awake we'll know and if we're asleep then

06:01.120 --> 06:09.280
it doesn't matter hmm well if I'm not awake and you are wake me up okay mummin is all right go to

08:02.000 --> 08:11.840

be a struggle this jam is really good does it always have to be winter catch a struggle in spring

08:17.920 --> 08:23.440
and summer instead well no that would be too easy you could just sit back and relax no you've

08:23.440 --> 08:29.600
got a face up to the cold and exercise to keep warm oh that sounds very interesting mr brisk

08:30.400 --> 08:37.840
one clear cold bath a day keeps all those unnecessary thoughts away my own little poem

08:38.480 --> 08:44.000

11:32.880 --> 11:37.360

13:04.000 --> 13:13.040
mr brisk says that he's gonna teach me oh i can't move my legs tied up like this

13:13.040 --> 13:16.880
that's the whole point you don't have to you just move your skis easy is winking

13:22.640 --> 13:25.120
first of all you have to learn how to fall properly

13:25.600 --> 13:28.960
but if i learn to ski first then i won't move

13:36.000 --> 13:42.320
little my husky too well they're just made from an old barrel yours are much more sophisticated

13:42.320 --> 13:49.120
now then vangernie's and lean forward are you ready i don't think i like this it's too steep can i

13:49.120 --> 13:53.760
practice on something a bit flatter well maybe next time now then off you roll

14:07.120 --> 14:13.280
trying to start navel and movement you know i think this hill is even steeper than the last one

14:13.280 --> 14:16.640
nothing to worry about you've already mastered falling down off you go

14:19.120 --> 14:21.120
oh

14:27.920 --> 14:31.200
oh stop me please you can do it yourself just calm down

14:43.440 --> 14:45.440

14:48.240 --> 14:50.640
that was terrific moment let's do it again

15:01.120 --> 15:05.120
what are you looking at sorry you i can hear all my brothers howling out there

15:05.120 --> 15:09.280
they're probably hungry and looking for food no i know they're calling me

15:09.760 --> 15:16.560
i'm going to see them i've really got to a moment

15:28.720 --> 15:34.160
got anything no night yet i'm afraid there's going to be trouble we're running out of jam

15:35.120 --> 15:42.000
mr. brisk i suppose you can't stop eating it when you have to ask him to leave i can't do that

15:42.560 --> 15:45.760
well of course you can it's your home and you can choose who you have

15:57.200 --> 16:02.560
a snowstorm is sweeping through the valley usually a sign that spring is not far away

16:04.160 --> 16:06.160
oh

16:34.160 --> 17:01.880
Oh, hello, Mr. Brisk, look, I'm sorry, but all the jams gone.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.480
And just an empty jar.

17:03.480 --> 17:08.480
Oh well, never mind, it was a great jam, but I have more important things on my mind.

17:08.480 --> 17:13.480
You see, now that spring is here, I have to leave, Moomin Valley.

17:13.480 --> 17:16.480
Oh, do you?

17:16.480 --> 17:20.480
Hmm, it's sad, but there you are, I have to go.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.480
Goodbye, Moomin.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.480
Goodbye, Mr. Brisk.

17:23.480 --> 17:26.480
Keep some jam for me.

17:33.840 --> 17:40.280
Uh.

17:57.880 --> 18:02.080
Hello, I'm sorry, I'm your brother, I've wanted to be with you for a long, long time.

18:02.080 --> 18:05.280
I'm afraid I'm not very braver strong, but if you'd let me stay with you.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.080
Oh, don't you know me?

18:10.880 --> 18:12.880
Looks like I was wrong.

18:13.080 --> 18:16.480
Oh, well, go on. Eat me if you want to.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.480
It's a pity I didn't sleep at night instead of learning to howl.

18:27.480 --> 18:30.080
Mum and I was right, I shouldn't have come.

18:32.080 --> 18:35.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

18:39.080 --> 18:42.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

18:56.080 --> 18:59.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

19:05.080 --> 19:09.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to sleep at night.

19:13.080 --> 19:16.080
Hello little doggy, what are you doing here?

19:16.080 --> 19:20.080
Have you been waiting for me?

19:20.080 --> 19:24.080
We'll have a great time traveling around the world together.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.080
Ah!

19:26.080 --> 19:28.080
Ha!

19:28.080 --> 19:30.080

19:40.080 --> 19:45.080
Ding! Ding, ding, ding! Ding! Ding, ding!

19:57.080 --> 20:00.080
BAM!

20:06.080 --> 20:08.080
That was spring breaking through the ice.

20:08.080 --> 20:10.080
Look at the theme moment, it's free again.

20:10.080 --> 20:12.080
Well, little my, get back.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.080
Oh.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.080
Oh my goodness.

20:36.080 --> 20:46.080
Little boy, hang on to me.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.080
Thank you, woman.

20:48.080 --> 20:52.080
Let's go.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.080
It's all right, women.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.080
Don't panic, I'm with you.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.080
You're okay.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.080
Whoa.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.080
It's all right, women.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.080
Don't panic, I'm with you.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.080
You're okay.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.080
Whoa.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.080
Oh.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.080
Over there, women.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.080
Quick, do.

21:14.080 --> 21:18.080
See, if you do what I tell you, there's nothing to be afraid of.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.080
Just trust me, women.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.080
I'm always right, aren't I?

21:22.080 --> 21:26.080
Yes, I know you are, little my, but we'd still better hurry.

21:27.080 --> 21:30.080
Come on, you two, just a bit further.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.080
Whoa.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.080
Whoa.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.080
It's cold in here.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.080
Quickly, let's get inside and light a fire.

21:44.080 --> 21:46.080
You'll soon warm up.

21:50.080 --> 21:52.080
Phew.

21:56.080 --> 22:00.080
And so Mr. Brisk and the ice both left woman valley

22:00.080 --> 22:06.080
and spring returned once more after a long and eventful winter.

22:08.080 --> 22:14.080
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:14.080 --> 22:22.080
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:22.080 --> 22:26.080
They're always happy and always at play.

22:26.080 --> 22:30.080
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:30.080 --> 22:34.080
The movements.

22:34.080 --> 22:38.080
The movements.

22:38.080 --> 22:44.080
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:44.080 --> 22:50.080
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:50.080 --> 22:54.080
They're always happy and always at play.

22:54.080 --> 22:58.080
The movements are having fun day after day.
