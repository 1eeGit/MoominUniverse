1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,500
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:30,340
me here for you on your TV they are the moments they are the moments so come

3
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:37,180
with me give me your hand I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just

4
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:44,540
like a bird sing that song ever there were the moments there were the

5
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:57,660
moments there were the moments there was the moments

6
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:31,340
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba,

7
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
All is peaceful in moving valley.

8
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,080
Mama waters the flowers

9
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,540
while Papa relaxes in the shade on the porch.

10
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,540
Look, Mama, Moomin Papa is sleeping again.

11
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,540
Hmm.

12
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,540
You had a long nap yesterday.

13
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,540
I think it must be the weather.

14
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,540
It's too hot and sunny for me.

15
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,540
I wonder if he's worried about anything.

16
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,540
Hmm.

17
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,540
You don't sleep if you're worried you do something about it.

18
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,540
But Moomin Papa does have something on his mind,

19
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,540
although it doesn't keep him awake.

20
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:15,540
He's having a nice dream as well.

21
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,540
Oh, a lighthouse.

22
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,540
Oh, that's it.

23
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,540
Oh, that's it, a lighthouse.

24
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,540
What about a lighthouse, Papa?

25
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,540
We're going to visit one.

26
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,540
When?

27
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,540
Right now.

28
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,540
Well, as soon as I find one anyway.

29
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,540
That should stop you being bored, Mama.

30
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,540
Oh, I'm not really dear, but it would be nice.

31
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,540
Yeah.

32
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,540
Oh, I'm really excited.

33
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,540
Just think I'm letting lovely water.

34
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,540
Yeah, I'll write an exciting, epic novel of the sea.

35
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,540
I'm sure it will be a great success.

36
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,540
If he puts some action in it, misses out the romantic stuff.

37
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,540
Stop it!

38
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,540
Stop it!

39
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,540
Tell me.

40
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,540
Does Moomin Papa want all of you to go away to this lighthouse?

41
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,540
Oh, yes.

42
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,540
It'll be great fun.

43
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,540
Just think of all the ships we'll be able to see.

44
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,540
Yes, that will be good.

45
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,540
Papa says he wants to write an exciting story about the sea,

46
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,540
with ships and storms and stuff.

47
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,540
Probably pirates too.

48
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,540
Oh, he's stuck writing his memoirs again, is he?

49
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,540
Well, I guess that might have something to do with it,

50
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,540
but I think he just wants another adventure.

51
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,540
Well, it sounds a bit odd to me, Moomin.

52
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,540
No, it's not.

53
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,540
We're going to live in a real lighthouse and save ships

54
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,540
from the rocks and being wrecked in terrible storms.

55
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,540
Oh, I see.

56
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,540
What do you think the lighthouse keeper might say about you moving in?

57
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,540
Oh, he won't mind at all.

58
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,540
It'll be company for it, and I'm sure he'd like someone to talk to,

59
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,540
looking after lighthouses a very lonely job.

60
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,540
Ah, but if you thought Moomin, that might be exactly why he chooses to do it.

61
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,540
You mean that he might want to be on his own all the time?

62
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,540
Well, some people like it like that.

63
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,540
Sometimes I like being on my own.

64
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,540
Not for long, though.

65
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,540
It'll be a lot of fun.

66
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,540
Snuffkin, why don't you come with us?

67
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,540
What to a lonely lighthouse?

68
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,540
Yes.

69
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,540
Oh, no, which one is it?

70
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,540
There, that's the one.

71
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,540
Where?

72
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,540
So small, you can hardly see it.

73
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,540
How long would it take us to get their Moomin, Papa?

74
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,540
A day or two, I should say.

75
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,540
It depending on the window.

76
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,540
But it looks so tiny.

77
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,540
Oh, I don't know.

78
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,540
Well, I think so.

79
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,540
How we know which one is which.

80
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,540
Oh, don't you worry about that.

81
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,540
I've got an old compass somewhere, and we've got the map,

82
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,540
then at night we'll be able to see the light itself.

83
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,540
Anyway, an old sailor.

84
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,540
An old sailor?

85
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,540
Well, I'm not really that young.

86
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,540
And you're no sailor.

87
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
Is this mutiny?

88
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,540
Don't be stupid.

89
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,540
How long do you think you'll want to stay, Papa?

90
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,540
About a month.

91
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,540
Oh, we all need to take lots and lots of food, then.

92
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,540
Well, bless me.

93
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,540
I think that'll be enough, Mama.

94
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,540
Surely there'll be somebody living there already.

95
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,540
Don't be stupid.

96
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,540
Of course there is.

97
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,540
A lighthouse must have a keeper.

98
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,540
Yes, a man dedicated to the sea,

99
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,540
suffering loneliness and hardship,

100
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,540
countless lives with no regard for his own.

101
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,540
Huh?

102
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,540
Is that you, Sniff?

103
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,540
Yes, hi, Mr. Hamilton.

104
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,540
I thought you'd be busy packing for the trip to the lighthouse.

105
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,540
No, well, I'm not going with them this time.

106
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,540
I've decided to stay here.

107
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,540
Oh, dear me, really?

108
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,540
Sniffkin said he was going.

109
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,540
Well, I have something very important to do.

110
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,540
Important?

111
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,540
Sniff is just a big whip, that's all.

112
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
Oh, shut up, little mind.

113
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,540
Ah, don't tell me to shut up.

114
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,540
I don't listen to whims.

115
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,540
Hmm, now, now children, no squabbling.

116
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,540
It wouldn't be fair to the others.

117
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,540
I'm not a very good swimmer.

118
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,540
You mean if you fell and then we're drowning,

119
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,540
we'd have to jump in and save you.

120
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,540
Don't fall in, then.

121
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,540
Anyway, you can hang on to an or something.

122
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,540
What if it got swept away?

123
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,540
We'll put a life jacket on you stupid.

124
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,540
Don't worry.

125
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,540
What about the sharks?

126
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,540
They might take a fancy to me.

127
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,540
Wait a minute.

128
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,540
I've not as aologist, but I don't think there are any sharks around here.

129
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,540
I'm sure I would have heard if there were.

130
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,540
Well, it's a real fine day for sailing.

131
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,540
We're a mama and the others.

132
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,540
Don't worry, Mum. There's no hurry.

133
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,540
Are you sure that isn't too heavy for you, Sniff?

134
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,540
No, not at all, mama.

135
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,540
It's a shame that you're not coming with us,

136
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,540
but if you've got something important to do, you must do it.

137
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,540
It won't be the same without you, though.

138
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,540
We'll miss you, Sniff.

139
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,540
Thank you.

140
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,540
Oh, dear, I left a jar of strawberry jam

141
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,540
and a whole batch of pancakes on the kitchen table.

142
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,540
Do you think you could manage to eat them?

143
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,540
Leave it to me.

144
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,540
Hi, y'all be lucky if there's any food left in the lard or mama.

145
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,540
He's a my.

146
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,540
Off we go, then.

147
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,540
Ike is away.

148
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,540
You won't have to road too hard.

149
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,540
The wind will pick us up soon.

150
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,540
Goodbye, I have a good time, everyone.

151
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,540
Goodbye, Sniff.

152
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,540
Now, don't forget to shut all the windows if it rains.

153
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,540
Will you?

154
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,540
No.

155
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,540
I'm on it.

156
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,540
Hey! Wait for me.

157
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,540
I want to have a good time too.

158
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,540
It's my way.

159
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,540
Huh?

160
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,540
Look, Sniff is still waving.

161
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,540
He's a sweet boy.

162
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,540
Let's keep waving, Moon.

163
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,540
Tell her we're out of sight.

164
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,540
Bye, Sniff.

165
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,540
Bye, bye.

166
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,540
Bye.

167
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,540
Bye.

168
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,540
No, I'm not waving good bye.

169
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,540
I want to go too.

170
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,540
Don't eat on the road, Mary Tabo.

171
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,540
We're gone.

172
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,540
It's no good shouting, little my.

173
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,540
He can't hear you.

174
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,540
He's giving us a great send-off, though.

175
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,540
For Sniff, he should have come with us.

176
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,540
Nancy, I'm going off and leaving me here on my own.

177
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,540
Sniff.

178
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,540
Sniff can, if you wouldn't mind,

179
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,540
I think we need some music to send us on our way.

180
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,540
What do you say?

181
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
Sniff.

182
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,540
Are you sure we're on the right course with the island, Papa?

183
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,540
Yes, the winds with us and the sails are fine.

184
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,540
I bet if we keep this speed up, we'll be there by tomorrow.

185
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,540
Well, if the wind stays like this, you could be right.

186
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,540
The wind's not dying down at all.

187
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,540
I'm surprised. I never thought we'd keep up this speed.

188
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,540
Now, make sure you're allergic to them.

189
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,540
Of course we will be, Papa.

190
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,540
If we carry on like this, perhaps we'll see the light from the lighthouse

191
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,540
while it's still dark.

192
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,540
Well, we don't want to hit anything at this speed.

193
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,540
Don't worry. We're watching.

194
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,540
We're watching.

195
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,540
We're watching.

196
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,540
We're watching.

197
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,540
We're watching.

198
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,540
We're watching.

199
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,540
We're watching.

200
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,540
We're watching.

201
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,540
We're watching.

202
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,540
We're watching.

203
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,540
We're watching.

204
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,540
Don't worry. We're watching.

205
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,540
Ah, this is the life.

206
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,540
Papa, the wind's dropped.

207
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,540
Well, that's strange.

208
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,540
It shouldn't happen that quickly.

209
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,540
Do you want us to start rowing, Moomin, Papa?

210
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,540
No, Snuffkin. I think we'd all better get some sleep.

211
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,540
Stupid wind. I really wanted to see the lighthouse at night.

212
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,540
It's getting foggy too.

213
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,540
I can't even see the stars anymore.

214
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,540
Right, Snuffkin. Wake me in two hours, and I'll take over.

215
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,540
Okay, Moomin, Papa.

216
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,540
What's the matter, Little My?

217
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,540
I thought I heard something.

218
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,540
Oh.

219
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,540
It's coming from over there somewhere.

220
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,540
Can you see anything?

221
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,540
No, but I can hear it.

222
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,540
It's so good I, and it's getting closer.

223
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,540
Little.

224
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,540
Moomin, Papa. Get up, Moomin.

225
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,540
Stop it, Little My. What's the matter with you?

226
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,540
You too, Moomin, quickly, before it's too late.

227
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,540
What's the matter, Little My?

228
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,540
I can hear her ship. I can't see it, but it's very close, and getting closer.

229
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,540
A ship? Where?

230
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,540
Over there, and she's bearing down on us.

231
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,540
Quickly, we don't have much time.

232
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,540
Yes, by the boobalier right.

233
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,540
We must let them know we're here, a signal.

234
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,540
Right? All hands on deck.

235
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,540
Maybe if we all shout as loud as we can.

236
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,540
Look.

237
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,540
Too late for shouting.

238
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,540
It's huge.

239
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,540
Look out, it's gonna hit us.

240
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,540
I think Moomin's right. What can we do?

241
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,540
It's too late for anything. Just brace ourselves and be ready to swim for it.

242
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,540
Huh?

243
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,540
Quick, get down, Little My.

244
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,540
I don't believe it.

245
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,540
Little My.

246
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,540
Huh?

247
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,540
That's hard. The ship didn't hit us.

248
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,540
Oh, yes, he did.

249
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,540
What?

250
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,540
It went straight into our rudder when nothing happened.

251
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,540
It went right through us.

252
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,540
Right through us. That's impossible she couldn't have.

253
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,540
I wonder if there was anyone on board that ship.

254
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
I can't see any lights.

255
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,540
I know, Snuffkin. I think it's a ghost ship.

256
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,540
A ghost ship?

257
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,540
Well, there's no wash and no damage to us.

258
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,540
It's the only explanation. I think she's right.

259
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,540
A ghost ship. We've actually seen one.

260
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,540
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I need to sit down. All this excitement's too much.

261
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,540
Papa, don't they say that if you see a ghost ship, something terrible is gonna happen to you?

262
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,540
What happened in the first place to make it become a ghost ship? That's what I wanna know.

263
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:57,540
Well, that's just some old sailor's tail, Moomin. If it had been a real ship, we'd probably be sinking now.

264
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,540
Don't you think so, Snuffkin?

265
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,540
Yeah, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.

266
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,540
Come on, cheer up you guys. At least it was fun.

267
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,540
What's the matter? Has something happened? What are you laughing at?

268
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,540
It's so funny. Are you going to tell us?

269
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,540
Why didn't you wake me up, Moomin?

270
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,540
Well, I think it would be very rude.

271
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,540
Oh, what a beautiful sky. Just look at it.

272
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,540
Oh, the fog is lifting.

273
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,540
Oh, I said, don't stop.

274
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,540
Another beautiful day, not a ghost ship in sight.

275
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,540
The lighthouse.

276
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,540
Hey, wake up everybody. The lighthouse. I can see the lighthouse. We're there.

277
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,540
Oh, the sun shining. We must have slept for hours.

278
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,540
Oh, there it is.

279
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,540
This is ridiculous. We've been next to it all night. We could have gone and slept there.

280
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,540
I can't wait to go ashore.

281
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,540
All right, everyone. Jump to it. Manly old.

282
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,540
There's something strange going on here.

283
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,540
What is it, Snuffkin?

284
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,540
I'm not sure. Moomin Papa. Our boat didn't move at all last night. Did it?

285
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,540
No, it doesn't seem to have moved at all.

286
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,540
So why couldn't we see the light from the lighthouse, even when the fog cleared?

287
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,540
I can't work it out.

288
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,540
Yes, you're right, Snuffkin. It seems very odd. We should have seen it.

289
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,540
Well, perhaps the lighthouse keeper forgot to put it on, Moomin Papa.

290
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,540
I don't think so, little Mai. You can't forget a thing like that.

291
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,540
I suppose it could be broken.

292
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:18,540
There could be lots of reasons for it. Why don't we hurry up and get ashore, and then we can ask the keeper.

293
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,540
Look, there's someone in a boat.

294
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,540
Hmm.

295
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,540
It looks like he's fishing.

296
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,540
He knows about the lighthouse. He probably lives on the island.

297
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,540
Let's get closer. Easy now.

298
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,540
Hi there, good morning.

299
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,540
Any luck?

300
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,540
Not yet, but it's still early.

301
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,540
Hmm, yes, quite. I'll ask him straight out.

302
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,540
Do you know if the lighthouse was working last night?

303
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,540
I don't know. Sorry, I didn't catch that.

304
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,540
He said, no, it wasn't.

305
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,540
What did I tell you? He forgot to light it.

306
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:20,540
Oh, it wasn't only last night. You'll never see a light in that lighthouse, not even on stormy nights.

307
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,540
Never. So what does the keeper do then?

308
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,540
Nothing. There isn't a lighthouse keeper.

309
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,540
Why?

310
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,540
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't know. All I can say is I haven't seen one.

311
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,540
Do you live on the island?

312
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:42,540
Hey, mister. You're asking too many questions. Who are you?

313
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,540
I'm Moment Papa from Moment Valley, and this is my family.

314
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,540
We've come a long way in order to do some important work here.

315
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,540
No work on this island. No, you better go back home.

316
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,540
You see, I've come here to research an epic novel about the sea.

317
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,540
Just turn around and go back. You're too far from home.

318
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,540
Oh, please, wait!

319
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,540
Shh, dear. Don't shout. We mustn't scare the fish away.

320
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,540
Let's go ashore and have some breakfast. I expect we're all hungry.

321
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,540
Bonnie, pair. The old ones lost his marbles.

322
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,540
Look, Moment Papa. There's a path there leading to the lighthouse.

323
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,540
We'll leave this stuff here and we'll go and explore it first.

324
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,540
Right. To the lighthouse, everyone. Up.

325
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,540
Oh!

326
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,540
Come on!

327
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,540
What's wrong? Why do you always get so upset when somebody mentions the lighthouse?

328
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,540
It's not your call, sir. Business boy doesn't concern you at all.

329
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,540
You were like that when I asked you about it before. Maybe if you were to tell me,

330
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,540
I might be able to understand. I could try anyway.

331
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,540
Either talk about something else or keep quiet. Do you understand that?

332
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,540
It's so very rocky. I don't think it would work. What?

333
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,540
A garden.

334
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:52,540
Hello there. Is there anybody at home?

335
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,540
There's nobody here. That boy was right. It's been empty for ages, I think.

336
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,540
Oh, the door was left unlocked. I know we do it, but most people don't.

337
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:10,540
Something terrible's happened. Something terrible. Please, little my. You know I hate things like that.

338
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,540
Don't worry, snorke may done. Little my is just trying to scare you.

339
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,540
I don't like hearing about anything horrible.

340
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:23,540
Flag your ears and snorke made, because I haven't finished yet, and the next bit's really horrible.

341
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,540
Oh, well, where have you been finished there?

342
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:32,540
Well, the lighthouse keeper is still up there. He got scurvy and had to be able to move for months.

343
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,540
And nobody's heard his cries for help, and with no food, he's almost a skeleton.

344
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,540
If he isn't dead already, he'll be at the top of the stairs, crawling towards his fingers,

345
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,540
lading and ripped up ribbons and flowers, mouth, garbage, that was tearless mouth.

346
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,540
Shut up, little my.

347
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,540
Reminds right, that's enough.

348
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,540
It's a good imagination, though.

349
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,540
I'll let you use it in your book, if you like.

350
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,540
Oh, come on. Tell me what did she say, Moonman?

351
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,540
Oh, nothing, really. Nothing at all.

352
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,540
Tell me, Moonman, but leave out the bits I wouldn't like.

353
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,540
Where are you going, Papa?

354
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,540
Well, listen, everyone.

355
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,540
First, I'm going to get the lamp working.

356
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,540
Then we'll give the place a good clean, and then we'll move in.

357
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,540
We'll be the new lighthouse keepers, and once again, the seas around this island

358
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,540
will be safe for ships to navigate in troubled water.

359
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,540
Good old Papa!

360
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,540
Great!

361
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
Careful, everyone.

362
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,540
Take anything, that's dangerous.

363
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,540
Oh!

364
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,540
Oh!

365
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,540
Will Moonman Papa be able to get the light working again?

366
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,540
Where is the lighthouse keeper?

367
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,540
And what could have made him go without locking the door,

368
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,540
leaving the ships in peril and the seas with no one to guide them away from the rocks?

369
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,540
And who is the mysterious fisherman?

370
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:10,540
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moonman's

371
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:18,540
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moonman's

372
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,540
They're always happy and always at play

373
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:29,540
The Moonman's are having fun day after day, the Moonman's

374
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:39,540
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moonman's

375
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:47,540
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moonman's

376
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,540
They're always happy and always at play

377
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:58,540
The Moonman's are having fun day after day, the Moonman's

378
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:08,540
The Moonman's
