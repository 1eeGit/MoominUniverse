148120	153880	not possible I won't let you out of this jail until you write out it's forbidden to burn
153880	160600	signs five thousand times each that's the punishment for vandals well in that case you won't be

205560	210120	moment mama you're right to worry for the curtain will rise tomorrow no matter what
212520	217720	women papa will remember to give Emma lots and lots of lines she's really looking forward to
217720	225000	her first performance all right now leave me I must be left alone to concentrate the writer needs
225000	230840	peace and quiet there are some things I don't like about this script I'll discuss it with you
230840	236680	after the performance sniff after if it's a story about lost children why do you have to have a
236680	243560	stupid lion I'm too good an actor to be cast as a lion keep them out of my hair when indeed he's
243560	249640	giving me a headache you come with me sniff we'll practice our parts this could be a wonderful
249640	256040	play if you'd only skip the lions behind I've heard enough about this behind remember we have
256040	262040	a lion's head too dying to show his acting skills on the stage this is my play and I refuse
262040	272120	to write out the lion's part I refuse here's the key I want you to keep a keen eye on them until
272120	278760	I come back do you understand me cousin are they very dangerous yes they certainly are they bite
278760	284600	if you let them out okay we certainly wouldn't bite anyone obviously I've had enough of your
284600	290440	lies don't listen to my dear cousin they do well then now I'm up to the theater to see the play
291320	299320	take good care of them while I'm gone
299880	315160	excuse me you seem to be a very good knitter oh thank you nobody ever said that to me before I enjoy it
315160	321800	what are you making I'm not sure I don't really know nothing in particular it's just that
321800	328680	knitting is so reassuring somehow nothing bad can happen while you knit can it trouble is I
328680	336200	always seem to forget to decide what to make before I start but it feels nice and warm and I
336200	344280	love the color couldn't you make socks it's a very nice sock color socks yes it's very very
344280	353960	cold in here oh yes that's a very good idea listen if I knitted each one of you a pair of warm
354040	361480	socks would you really put them on of course that will be nice I'm almost freezing to death in here
361480	368920	it's so very very cold is it really that cold yes my teeth are chattering so I could hardly talk
368920	377960	honestly oh dear oh dear what should I do maybe some steaming hot black currant juice would help
377960	383400	to warm us up a little possibly although it might already be too late
400680	406120	my cousin would be very angry with me if he knew but I think but you think why I think I'll
406120	417960	let you out so that we can all be nice and warm indoors really don't cry now baby there's a good
417960	433000	boy don't cry honey that's enough baby oh woman mama you need to show much more immersion it's
433000	439320	right to be more motherly and more loving listen dear this is a very happy baby how am I doing
439320	444280	woman papa you're just perfect for the part sniffing your performance was excellent
446520	458280	maybe I should add a part with some lines in it
463320	469160	look at these I think they might be ready by now I hope they're tasty they don't always come out
469160	476440	very well you're so kind we've had so much already but they smell really delicious they sure do
476440	482440	thank you so much now I feel warm again how about some more black currant juice or maybe one of these
482440	487720	freshly baked cookies it's very kind of you but no thank you I couldn't eat another thing I'm so
487720	498440	full up me too oh dear the party is over then I'm afraid so it's really sad but I have to
498440	503480	lock you up again but at least I know you're warm in there we're really sorry too but you don't
503480	509880	need to worry because actually we're not going back to jail oh aren't you we've got other plans
509880	516120	we're going to the theater to see my parents play and I suppose I should say hello to my Aunt Emma
516120	523800	who works there oh what shall I do my cousin will be very cross with me but you see we're innocent
523800	531400	we didn't do anything wrong you didn't I swear it do I look like someone who pulls up signs in a
531400	536680	park we just burned some flats and left by the flood but your cousin wouldn't believe it he
536680	543560	jumped to conclusions wrongful arrest that's all it was oh dear why didn't you tell me that it
543560	550120	once oh people shouldn't go to jail when they haven't done anything wrong so we can go to the
550120	555560	theaters that okay of course better leave right away my cousin will be very disappointed but I
555560	562120	guess I can't be helped wait for me I think I'd better come along and explain to that cousin of
562120	568360	mind that his three prisoners are innocent of the charge against them
569160	577080	all right all right bring it in that's right momma stop there okay sniff moment mama what have
577080	583080	you got there a baby's crib I want to use this in the play if that's all right with you
583080	589720	moment papa moment papa I just read your script and I think you have a big problem who is going
589720	595080	to pay the parts of moment and snorkemaiden in this play of yours I don't know yet we don't have
595080	601000	any more children and sniff can't take the part are you utterly mad we only have a few hours
601000	605880	before the curtain goes up and you don't even have actors for all the part what kind of director is
605880	610840	that maybe one of us could stand behind something and sort of read their line we did kill us
610920	620440	idea let's hope the credits are brown hold on tight all of you
625640	629160	listen kids you can be as noisy as you like out here but once we're at the
629160	638280	end or you have to be quiet you want to stand
