00:42.620 --> 00:57.620
there were the movements there were the movements there were the movements

01:12.620 --> 01:41.620
the seeds that movement and his friends had found in a box that had been cast up on the beach

01:41.620 --> 02:03.620
had grown into a tropical forest it was beautiful but also dangerous with man-eating plants kept a bay by snuffkin playing as harmonica but for how long

02:04.620 --> 02:19.620
oh dear snuffkin don't stop playing your harmonica whatever you do they'll only get angry and attack us all over again

02:19.620 --> 02:25.620
if I don't stop soon I might never want to play again

02:25.620 --> 02:35.620
well perhaps the music has made them more friendly be careful mr. himmelon oh don't worry

02:35.620 --> 02:45.620
mr. himmelon look out

02:45.620 --> 02:55.620
I don't think the quickly snuffkin play again

02:55.620 --> 02:57.620
oh

02:57.620 --> 02:59.620
oh

02:59.620 --> 03:01.620
oh

03:19.620 --> 03:23.620
papa we must make sure the trap door won't open again

03:23.620 --> 03:33.620
oh yes what's this about a trap door in the kitchen they almost got him before in the tag mama we reached her just in time

03:53.620 --> 03:55.620
oh

04:15.620 --> 04:21.620
I feel sorry for them it can't be helped snuffkin if we let them out will be eaten alive

04:23.620 --> 04:29.620
it makes me feel very uncomfortable having man-eating plants under the floor

04:29.620 --> 04:33.620
always keep a kettle of boiling water handy in case they break through

04:33.620 --> 04:41.620
the children are playing Tarzan they might as well seeing as they've got a jungle to play in

04:41.620 --> 04:44.620
still planting those seeds might have been a terrible mistake

04:44.620 --> 04:52.620
well mama I'm very glad that you did just think what I would have missed and movement valley suddenly being full of tropical plants

04:52.620 --> 04:58.620
is wonderful I'm not fond of traveling as you know and you've brought the plants to me

04:58.620 --> 05:06.620
the trees make it much cooler but those man-eaters who I could do without them

05:06.620 --> 05:16.620
you're just like Tarzan Tarzan loves James

05:16.620 --> 05:20.620
oh what bliss

05:20.620 --> 05:28.620
stinky's over there stinky Tarzan teach old baddie lesson

05:28.620 --> 05:30.620
oh

05:42.620 --> 05:46.620
pretty stupid moment playing Tarzan without wild animals

05:46.620 --> 05:52.620
animals don't come from seeds no but you need them to have a real jungle I can get you some if you want

05:52.620 --> 06:00.620
really I'll do anything for my friends that's very kind of you not too wild though no lions or tigers or anything

06:00.620 --> 06:08.620
maybe it maybe chimpanzee I know exactly what you need

06:08.620 --> 06:12.620
cheese bread

06:18.620 --> 06:22.620
what are you doing mama well I don't like the thought of all those man-eaters still in the

06:22.620 --> 06:26.620
cellar so your father and I are going to sleep in the bathhouse

06:26.620 --> 06:30.620
