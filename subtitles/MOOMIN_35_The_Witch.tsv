284240	289600	seen so far your grandma must be crazy or something making you wait in a place like this no our
289600	295040	house is in the forest and she's coming to show me the way in the forest you mean the forest of
295040	302240	witches yes I suppose so it's not very far from here that's it definitely how long have you been
302240	308400	waiting here oh about an hour one hour she's not very punctual perhaps I was early
309040	318640	yes she was an hour early oh it's grandma welcome Alicia
323280	328080	where do you find all these children my dear I was waiting here all alone and then they came

335280	345680	let's go come along excuse me excuse me ma'am but don't you live in the forest
347360	354800	and did I do in what part of it let me see it must be about right in the middle interesting the
354800	360160	only place I know of is an old house where they say witches used to live you don't say I'm
360160	364400	mad well what do you know what will he think I'm next
364400	366400	oh
377600	385840	her grandmother is a witch I think but surely they don't exist of course not like dragons don't exist
387360	393760	well she doesn't seem like a nasty one how can you tell moment I don't think that nice girl would
393760	402560	have a bad one for grandma perhaps not so tell me what makes you think she's a witch yeah who else
402560	408000	could live in that forest papa I can't think of anyone right now but some people would like it
408000	413600	yes I suppose you're right I hope you are well I've lived in movement valley for a long time
413600	417280	and I'm never once seen a witch so they don't exist
421520	425840	yeah oh stop working now snork dinner's ready I'm coming
431040	437200	no wonder it's so light look the moon is up snork maiden I think it would be very wise for you
437200	442880	to stay with the movements from tonight on why on earth do you think that snork I've decided not
442880	449040	to hibernate this winter why ever not I want to complete the blueprint for my new flying ship
449040	456880	by next spring for a real inventor sleep is an unnecessary luxury science my dear snork maiden
456880	463280	will not wait while inventors take a nap but you know dear snork how dependent you are in your sleep
463280	468080	I'll stay with very well then this winter I will hibernate with the movements
468400	472080	excellent shall we have dinner I'm ready now
482560	487360	most certainly snork snork maiden will be just fine here with us thank you
488560	493360	this is nice for movement too now you'll have snork maiden to keep him company yes
494160	498160	but who needs company when they're hibernating after all moment will be faster sleep
498720	504000	never the less sleeping is much nicer when someone else sleeps in the same room when do we start
504000	510240	hibernating do you think with weather like this in another few days again so early we'll have
510240	515120	snow before the week is out well good luck with your new blueprint snork I look forward to seeing
515120	520880	your flying ship in the spring hmm come this time next year I'll definitely be flying about
524080	532000	thanks again for taking snork maiden it's not trouble at all good night then good night snork see you
532000	546320	snork maiden good luck this winter snork thank goodness at last I can really concentrate on my work
553840	557120	I don't believe this
561760	571760	am I hallucinating
584320	589920	oh a witch I'm sure it was I'm positive I'm a broomstick
591200	596240	when the snork gets an idea in his head it's not much room for anyone or anything else is there
596640	602000	I hope you'll succeed this time at least in my dream that rounding really flew well
602000	608400	I often dream that I fly but I wouldn't dream of trying it out snork must have had some sort of a new idea
608560	611360	oh it's snork
616720	620720	what's the matter
627440	629120	oh that's my piece of cake
629280	636000	you look like you've seen a ghost not a ghost she left at me
636480	642640	murdered she was flying on a broom no engine at all are you talking about the witch what's the
642640	649920	use there's no point if you can do it so easily holding itself together you really swore yes
649920	663200	but what right near I can't see any witch up there snork just the moon up in the sky
673520	678560	and she was really flying in the sky is that what snork said well he should know about
678640	685040	things that fly hmm but I just can't believe it until I've seen it myself if she really is a witch
685040	690720	then what about the girl I mean no one could be happy living with a witch I really don't know I
690720	696640	thought witches had to be old maybe it's not her real grandmother she could be adopted well
696640	700560	woman we must get to the bottom of this yes enough can we must
709440	715360	huh cop you at it again you and your secret plan where are you going today you can't come with
715360	720720	us little fly and why not because we're going on a dangerous mission we're going to the forest of
720720	726320	witches well if you're in any danger then I must certainly come along to look after you moon and
726320	734880	come on besides nothing's exciting to happen to me since I went up with a kite this is so exciting
736480	741440	sleeping only through a set of four that I must cram in one adventure first this is what we'll do
741440	745520	I grab the witch and while she's helpless you two grab the girl and whisk her away to safety
745520	750640	that sounds great but we don't know if she is a witch little my if we grab her and she isn't a
750720	755760	witch it would be embarrassing and we could all be in trouble maybe the witch needed an innocent
755760	762400	maiden to try out some potions to experiment on her maybe let's find out how do we find out by
762400	767440	snooping around I suppose I hope you'll think of something a bit better than that before we get
767440	772640	there let's hide as close to the houses we can and then ask the girl as soon as she comes out
773360	780560	and what if she doesn't come out snuffkin then we'll improvise little my so this is the famous plan
780560	786160	by the great snuffkin look if she doesn't come out of the house we'll just go up a knock on the door
788800	794400	once we're inside I'm sure we'll be able to tell what's really what I don't think it's a very
794400	799920	good idea what if she catches a spell on us little my will wait outside and if we don't come out she
799920	805200	can run back to moonman valley for help that's fine but moonman can wait outside and I'll search the
805200	811040	house oh no little my you can wait outside and I will search the house let's do it this way you stay
811040	817280	outside and if we get caught try to free us and run for help as quickly as you can only if you can't
817280	823280	is that okay that means if you're in trouble your lives will be in my hands that's right little
823280	828640	my I don't like this out of this I'm not sure I want little my to be my last home while I
828640	832800	wouldn't help anyone who doesn't trust me that's for sure you're that see what I mean
834160	837200	be quiet there's a house
843600	850160	look at this it's very quiet do you think there's anybody home I don't know let's wait a while and see
851280	857440	do we have to stay absolutely still but of course we do we'll feel extremely silly if the house is
857440	863840	empty they've disappeared they could have told us where they were going I'm sure I don't care
863840	870400	little my went to I think she's betrayed us that's just like her don't worry I've got a pretty good
870400	876400	idea where they were heading for you know where they've gone why didn't you tell me where are they
876400	882000	they've gone to the forest of witches what they've gone to see whether the woman we met yesterday's
882000	889280	a real witch a real one why don't we go there too I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find my way sniff
891120	902160	what is it no it's my stomach I better lie down oh it's very painful oh how much longer we
902160	907760	can have to stay here like this this adventure isn't the least bit exciting well let's wait a
907760	912640	little bit longer be quiet at least we know the girl is definitely in there no we don't she
912640	916880	might be out she could be anywhere I know that's possible but I don't think so
922880	929600	she's getting some water as I thought that way she's working her to the bone hey little boy
929600	934160	she's following that girl you go with her movement and find out as much as you possibly can about
934160	943280	what's going on I'll watch the house right hey wait for me
964160	969280	oh
994160	1019160	If you're looking for Alicia, she's up.
1020160	1024160	Stop! Listen, wait and see.
1024160	1027160	I wasn't doing anything wrong.
1027160	1034160	Why did you try to run away then?
1034160	1036160	Oh, I'll help you with that.
1036160	1037160	So will I.
1037160	1041160	How kind of you. It is a bit heavy to carry, you know.
1041160	1044160	I think I remember your name. Is it Alicia?
1044160	1046160	Yes, it is. I'm so glad you remembered it.
1046160	1048160	My name is Lohman.
1048160	1049160	And I'm Lohman.
1049160	1051160	What are you doing here in the forest of witches?
1051160	1055160	Well, to be perfectly honest, we came because we were rather worried about you.
1055160	1057160	What about me? Why is that?
1057160	1060160	Is that a woman really your grandmother?
1060160	1061160	Of course.
1061160	1062160	You're quite sure?
1062160	1066160	Yes, of course. She's my mother's mother. Why do you ask?
1066160	1068160	Well, don't you know?
1068160	1070160	He's trying to ask.
1070160	1071160	That's cool.
1071160	1073160	Or maybe your grandmother is a witch.
1073160	1074160	Yes, she is.
1074160	1076160	Of course.
1076160	1079160	Oh, I'm sorry. I was a bit taken aback.
1079160	1082160	You don't mind about your grandmother being a real witch?
1082160	1083160	Oh, no.
1083160	1086160	That's what she is. I was husband.
1086160	1088160	I'm going to be one, too, when I'm grown up.
1088160	1090160	Oh, no. You couldn't.
1090160	1092160	Well, you don't look anything like one.
1092160	1094160	Well, that's because I'm not one yet.
1094160	1097160	When you're born into a witch family, that's what you become.
1097160	1099160	But it's not that easy, you know.
1099160	1101160	Oh, this is too much.
1102160	1105160	Now, tell me, what are you doing here in the forest of witches?
1105160	1107160	You don't sound like a witch.
1107160	1110160	Oh, really? What do witches sound like?
1110160	1113160	Well, to be honest, you're the first one I've ever met in my whole life.
1113160	1116160	I'm sure that's just what you think, young man.
1116160	1119160	Is it true that the nice girl is really your granddaughter?
1119160	1122160	Certainly. A very promising young girl.
1122160	1126160	Honest and hardworking, and with a lot of training, she will make an excellent witch someday.
1126160	1129160	But how can you possibly turn such a sweet girl into a witch?
1130160	1132160	The sweetest girls make the best witches.
1132160	1134160	Hello, didn't know you were back, Grandma.
1134160	1137160	Thank you for getting the water, Alicia.
1137160	1139160	Oh, who's that?
1139160	1143160	I don't know. Some naive young man ought to rescue a damsel in distress now.
1143160	1146160	I remember you, your snuffkin.
1146160	1147160	Yes.
1150160	1153160	Your friend snuffkins in here, why don't you come in, too?
1153160	1154160	In the house?
1154160	1155160	Really?
1155160	1157160	He's brought friends with him, has he?
1157160	1160160	Suffkin, whatever they're done to you.
1160160	1162160	I'll take care of that.
1162160	1164160	Wait a second, I'll do it for you.
1164160	1166160	I'll fix it.
1171160	1173160	Wait, I'm gonna need you again.
1173160	1175160	Where are you going?
1175160	1178160	I don't think that snake ever got bitten before.
1178160	1179160	I'll get another.
1179160	1182160	I'm very curious, why are you three here, huh?
1182160	1186160	They came all the way from Moomin Valley because they were really worried about me, Grandma.
1187160	1188160	What about you?
1188160	1194160	Yes, they thought you might be nasty to me, so they came all this way to see if I needed help.
1194160	1196160	This always happens.
1196160	1201160	People treat witches as if they weren't ordinary, respectable, responsible citizens.
1201160	1203160	No, no, we're very sorry.
1203160	1210160	We realize she's quite okay and she's most welcome to visit us in Moomin Valley at any time, isn't she snuffkin?
1210160	1212160	Yes, certainly.
1212160	1215160	What? You said you'd visit these people?
1215160	1220160	Yes, I thought I'd go over there sometimes after I finished with my homework, of course.
1220160	1222160	I would never leave my studies half done.
1222160	1228160	Sorry, Alicia, but if you ever want to become a good witch, you mustn't see any ordinary mortals.
1228160	1233160	Oh, why not? I've only just become friends with them, Grandma, please.
1233160	1238160	I know. Why don't I wait a year and study to be a witch next year?
1238160	1240160	Alicia.
1241160	1247160	This is family business, so if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you were to leave.
1247160	1251160	And I'd like you to go immediately if you'd please.
1261160	1264160	It's snowing.
1264160	1271160	While she certainly won't be able to visit us at Moomin Valley is buried in snow, so we might never see her again.
1271160	1276160	No, that's right, and you'll be leaving soon, won't you snuffkin?
1276160	1281160	Winter had come once again to Moomin Valley.
1281160	1284160	It's snowing.
1311160	1318160	The Moons are having fun day after day, the Moons.
1318160	1321160	The Moons.
1321160	1328160	The Moons.
