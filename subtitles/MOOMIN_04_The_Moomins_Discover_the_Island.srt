1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,800
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:33,040
me here for you on your TV they are the movements they are the movements so come with me give me your hand

3
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there with the

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:56,640
movements there was the movements there was the movements there was the

La la la la la una la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

7
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And you know how hungry the sea air made you all last time we went out on a boat.

8
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You'd have been glad of food then.

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You got to rough it a bit if you want an adventure.

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes, but it will be more fun with coffee and pancakes.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Aren't you two ready yet?

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hello, Mummin!

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hi, Snorgvagan!

14
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Must you use that ladder?

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm all right.

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Mummin, you're going to hurt yourself one of these days.

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's good practice. It's Snorg coming with us.

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He says he hasn't got time for sailing boats at the moment.

19
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'd much rather a real sailing boat than a paper flying ship any day.

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Are Mumma and Papa ready yet?

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They're packing up half the kitchen.

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, it's too full.

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Have we got to take all that with us?

24
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Mumma thinks it's better to be safe than sorry and she's usually right.

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Tell me, Mummin, where exactly are we going?

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We haven't decided yet.

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's right. Wait and see.

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's see.

29
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Mr. Hamulin?

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Have you found a rare plan for your collection yet?

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Unfortunately not. There are lots of these in Mummin Valley already.

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Goodness, where are you taking all that?

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We're going sailing.

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Have exciting, charting new seas and exploring desert islands.

35
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Never know.

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If I help you load up the boat, can I please come with you?

37
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Captain the bridge!

38
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Man the yard arm!

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hankers away!

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Sailors beware!

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Spikes the manbrace!

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
All hands on deck!

43
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Full speed ahead!

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hey, Sniff. Any sun in the movements?

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Not yet.

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's a great day to go sailing.

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I wonder where we're going.

48
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't have any idea.

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Hmm, I don't actually like sailing much.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Do you get sick?

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, not really sick.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's just that I can't swim.

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And if it's rough, it frightens me and I panic a bit.

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It looks like it's going to stay calm.

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So don't worry.

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Right, that's the lot.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Now all aboard.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Mama, little Mai, Sniffkin, Mummin, Snork Maiden,

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and Mr. Hamulin, of course.

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Isn't he a bit old for adventures?

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Not at all. No, Mummin Papa has promised to find a deserted island

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
where I shall search for rare plants.

63
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Come on, Sniff, hurry up!

64
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
There's no rum.

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Don't be silly, Sniff. Of course there is.

66
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It looks very full, almost thinking.

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
There's no way this boat could sink.

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Now come on, get him.

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Really?

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I promise it'll be all right.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Won't it, Papa?

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, if it stays like this, it will, Mummin.

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll come next time.

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's go, Mummin Papa.

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He's just a scaredy cat.

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We'll go without you then, Sniff.

77
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I think that will be best.

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Anyway, someone had better stay and look after Mummin House,

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and it might just as well be me.

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's very thoughtful of you.

81
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
There's a pancake on the kitchen table that you can have for lunch.

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Thank you, Mummin, Mama. Have a nice trip.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I wish Sniff had come.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He's a big softy.

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Well, he's not very good at swimming,

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and he doesn't eat rather a lot.

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What?

88
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is the life, isn't it, Mama?

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It certainly is, dear.

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Oh, look, not a breath of wind.

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Shall I start rowing, Papa?

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yes, you'd better get Sniffkin to help you.

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Aye-aye, Captain.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's hardly moving.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You'll have to do better than that.

96
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We're doing our best.

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You two would be useless as Gally's slaves,

98
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and you'd have to do your best to help them.

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We're doing our best.

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You two would be useless as Gally's slaves,

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and you'd have to do your best to help them.

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You two would be useless as Gally's slaves.

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's good that we're not then, isn't it?

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So then, what's your excuse?

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's not easy rowing against the tide.

106
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You try it.

107
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
No, dear, at this rate, I should be lucky to find one rare plant.

108
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, Mr. Hamlin, you could always try collecting some seaweed instead.

109
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There's plenty of that.

110
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I have heard tales that if you whistle,

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
those who perished at sea will send you a wind.

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Land! Hoi! Look, Moomin, Papa!

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's too small to be any good.

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You're right.

115
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Hey, look, Papa. We're moving again.

116
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The tide's turned and the winds up.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What a beautiful island!

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And a perfect place to land, too.

119
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh, I bet this place has got some rare plants.

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Be careful when you explore. There could be wild animals there.

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Now, if someone will go and collect some wood, I'll get a fire started.

122
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I've had none of you will say no to coffee and pancakes.

123
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Watch me, you land lovers. I'll go and pull the boat ashore.

124
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hmm, I suppose you're right. This will come in handy.

125
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
As I said, Papa, it's always better to rough it with a little bit of luxury.

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I wonder if we're the first to set foot on the island.

127
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Thank you, children.

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Is there anything else you want us to do?

129
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No, I don't think so.

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Is it okay if I go explore the island?

131
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Of course, off you go.

132
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Coming, snort, Maiden.

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll stay and help Moomin Mama with the cooking.

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Mama, you said we needed firewood. Is this enough?

135
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
My goodness for a lot.

136
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You know, I don't think anyone lives on this island.

137
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I haven't seen anyone unless they're hiding in the bushes.

138
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I've seen someone.

139
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh, yeah? Who?

140
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Well, they weren't very big.

141
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What do you mean, this big?

142
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Well, same as me.

143
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What did they look like?

144
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Sort of white and ghostly and not very friendly looking either, Moomin.

145
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, you probably just thought you saw something a little, Maiden.

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I did see them. I did too.

147
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Keep your hair on. I'm not saying you didn't see anything.

148
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Goodness, this is magnificent.

149
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh, what a find.

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And what's this?

151
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, well.

152
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Well, well, well.

153
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I've never seen such rare and beautiful plants.

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh.

155
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Well, what's this? Goodness, it's a perimeter.

156
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Now, let's see. Rain and storm. Probably broken.

157
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, hello. Who are you?

158
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh, I see. This is your perimeter, isn't it? Now, watch it.

159
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Mind you don't travel on those flowers, will you?

160
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh, no, no, no. They're coming to get me.

161
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Don't go away. Don't go away.

162
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I think what little my saw was a hatty fattener.

163
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
They're not ghosts. Are they snuffkin?

164
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
No, they look kind of like it, but they're really harmless enough.

165
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, leave me alone.

166
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Oh, dear. What on earth was that?

167
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It sounded like Mr. Himulet.

168
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Don't get away. Oh, help me, please.

169
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's it. That's what I saw.

170
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's Mr. Himulet.

171
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Help! Get me down.

172
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Why are they after you, Mr. Himulet? What'd you do to them?

173
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't know. I just tapped on this post and asked them to be careful.

174
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Is that what I saw? It's Mr. Himulet.

175
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Help! Get me down.

176
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Why are they after you, Mr. Himulet? What'd you do to them?

177
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I just tapped on this post and asked them to be careful.

178
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Is that ours? They seem a bit angry to me.

179
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Well, then I tapped the marrometer to check the weather and they came at me.

180
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, I don't think it's a flower's a mad about.

181
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Maybe they thought you were trying to steal the marrometer.

182
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't want it to keep it. My goodness, I'm collecting flowers, not marrometers.

183
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Well, hang on.

184
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't hang on much longer. Hurry, please.

185
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
They don't look so easily frightened.

186
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No, now let me think.

187
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Hurry, I'm slipping.

188
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I've got it, Mr. Himulet.

189
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The haddifatators can't see or hear very well, but they are very sensitive.

190
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We'll have to try and frighten them.

191
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I suggest you shake the post as hard as you can.

192
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Like this.

193
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Harder. Harder, Mr. Himulet.

194
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Look, they can feel the ground moving.

195
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Keep going, Mr. Himulet.

196
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm getting really tired.

197
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm exhausted, I can't.

198
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They're not going.

199
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Are you sure this will work?

200
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You can stop now, Mr. Himulet.

201
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Mr. Himulet.

202
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Hey, are you all right, Mr. Himulet?

203
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What disgusting creatures.

204
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I have a good mind to take their precious barometer.

205
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't think that's such a good idea.

206
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's no good anyway, it's not working.

207
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
How do you know that, Mr. Himulet?

208
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Look, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?

209
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But according to this barometer, it should be pouring down with rain.

210
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This is the way to explore real home cooking.

211
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It just takes a little thought.

212
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And woman papa is always prepared, aren't you dear?

213
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Double zero, it can't get any lower than that.

214
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What does that mean?

215
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
If it was working, it would mean we'd be in for a terrible storm.

216
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I think the reading might be right after all, Mr. Himulet.

217
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
See the way the sky is darkening.

218
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Look at those storm clouds.

219
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We better go before it's too late.

220
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But there won't be time to get home.

221
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
We'll be shipwreck, woman papa.

222
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Surely there's still time.

223
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We don't want to go back to moving valley yet.

224
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We've only explored half the island.

225
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Besides, you never know what we might find, Snort Maiden.

226
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I wanted to get my hands on those happy fat nurse.

227
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's the last thing I wanted to do, little mind, the very last.

228
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I think we ought to leave now.

229
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What do you think, mama?

230
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Well, you're the captain, dear. It's up to you.

231
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So I am. Now, let me think.

232
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh.

233
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Right, we'll stay.

234
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, can we?

235
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yes, but we must put the tent up before it starts raining.

236
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What tent?

237
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Always be prepared.

238
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's my motto.

239
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You're very clever to think of everything.

240
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
First, we must lower the sails and pull the boat up so that she's out of harm's way.

241
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That should do it.

242
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Well done, everybody.

243
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It should be safe here.

244
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Now hurry with the tent, the storm's nearly here.

245
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Are you all right, Mr. Himulan?

246
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You stay here and rest, eh?

247
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
We'll manage without you.

248
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I am a bit tired.

249
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You get your breath back first, but don't forget to tie the boat to that tree before you come up.

250
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It looks bad. A real humdinger.

251
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You can touch me.

252
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Right, let's get that tent up.

253
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh, dear, what a day.

254
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh, what's this here?

255
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh, yes.

256
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Well, fancy that I've never seen one of these before.

257
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Snuffkin?

258
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What's happening?

259
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's coming really fast.

260
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Look at the rain over the sea.

261
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We're going to get soaked if we stay here.

262
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Just a minute.

263
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But we'll get wet.

264
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I know, but it's so exciting.

265
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Huh?

266
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Things which you have no control over.

267
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You can see this great big storm coming towards you,

268
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and you can't do anything about it.

269
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
No.

270
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You have to time it just right.

271
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
When to make a run for shelter, you mean?

272
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I knew you'd understand.

273
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I wonder what the Hattie Fatterners are doing.

274
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Waiting for the thunderstorm.

275
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Why?

276
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Because they get energy from the electricity and the lightning.

277
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Really?

278
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's it!

279
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Come on!

280
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I've never seen rain like this.

281
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It'll be over soon enough, Momen.

282
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You're dressed, Mom.

283
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I know.

284
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's all right.

285
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I know.

286
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I know.

287
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I know.

288
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I know.

289
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I know.

290
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I know.

291
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I know.

292
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I know.

293
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I know.

294
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I know.

295
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I know.

296
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I know.

297
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I know.

298
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I know.

299
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's all right.

300
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'll look after you.

301
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's all right.

302
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's all right.

303
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I know.

304
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's all right.

305
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's all right.

306
00:20:45,000 --> 00:21:11,960
that was a close one too close I think it's over snort maiden what a

307
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:33,360
find I made today

308
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,280
if like the movements and their friends you're stranded on the desert island in a

309
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:44,120
huge storm all you can do is wait until it's blown itself out but what if the

310
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,720
waves are so high that your boat has caught up and washed out to sea that is a

311
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,160
different story altogether
