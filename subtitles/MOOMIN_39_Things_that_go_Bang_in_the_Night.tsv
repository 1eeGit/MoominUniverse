0	21000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.
29000	35000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.
35000	46000	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,
47000	66000	there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.
66000	67000	What?
67000	68000	What?
68000	80900	Big explosions could be heard in Moomin Valley almost every night, and Moomin couldn't sleep
80900	81900	awake.
81900	89680	Usually there was just one, but sometimes even two.
89680	91680	You heard it too, Moomin, pop up.
91680	94480	Yes, those loud bangs are kicking me awake.
94480	99760	I wonder if there'll be another one.
99760	101960	They seem to be coming from the north.
101960	103680	Hmm, he's sti-thought.
103680	105800	Or they could be coming from lonely mountains.
105800	109360	If you ask me, I believe they're the work of the witch.
109360	110360	The witch?
110360	112560	But witches don't make a lot of noise.
112560	113560	Never know.
113560	116200	They're sneaky characters.
116200	120960	Tomorrow I'll have a few words with the inspector, except to him to put a stop to it.
120960	123800	Papa, why would the witch want to make explosions?
123800	124800	Why not?
124800	129320	The first bang wakes me up, and then I lie awake waiting for the second one, which might
129320	130920	not come at all.
130920	134760	The bags might not come from Moomin Valley at all, and they might be just an echo off
134760	135760	the mountains.
135760	136760	Do you think so?
136760	137760	Yes, I do.
137760	139520	Well, at least that's what Snuffkin thinks.
139520	141800	And the explosions might come from the sea.
141800	143280	That's what Snuffkin figured.
143280	146360	He thought it might be pirates or something making the noises.
146360	150040	He's already had pirates, and they went a long time ago.
150040	151520	I'm plumping for the witch.
151520	152520	There's no doubt in my mind.
152560	154080	What are you doing out here?
154080	156920	We're waiting for another explosion, Mama.
156920	158480	You're waiting, Vane, dear.
158480	160480	No, no, no, no, that Moomin, Mama.
160480	164720	Well, we had two explosions last night, and we've never had double explosions for two
164720	167720	nights in a row.
167720	169560	Until now, that is.
169560	170560	You heard that.
170560	171960	It clearly came from over there.
171960	172960	Over there?
172960	173960	Oh, no.
173960	176320	It certainly came from over there.
176320	177760	You couldn't mistake it.
177760	178760	I'm sure of it.
182520	192320	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
192320	193840	Good morning, Moomin, lovely day.
193840	195280	Good morning, Snuffkin.
195280	196760	You look very sleepy.
196760	200960	So would you be opposed to explosions that kept you awake for most of the night?
200960	203280	Those explosions are really very hard, aren't they?
203280	204760	They certainly are.
204760	207760	Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?
207760	211040	Moomin, Papa's convinced that she's the one who's making the bangs.
211040	212540	I think he's wrong there.
212540	216040	That's what I thought, but there's nothing I could say to convince him.
216040	219040	So now I'm going to find out for myself.
219040	223040	You can certainly ask her, but do you really trust a witch to tell you the truth?
225040	226040	Do you, a woman?
226040	229040	But witches don't have to lie, Shirley.
237040	239040	Is that you, Little My?
241040	243040	And where are you two going?
243040	244040	Little My.
244040	247040	Are you tailing me full time or what?
247040	252040	Yes, whenever you're sneaking off somewhere, I'm not sneaking, I'm just walking.
252040	255040	Well, I've never seen anyone walking in such a sneaky way.
260040	264040	Last time the witch tried to keep you from waking up, didn't she?
264040	265040	So?
265040	268040	So you think now she's trying to keep you from sleeping?
268040	272040	Well, if she makes the explosions, it's always possible that someone else is the target.
272040	277040	We know very little about witches, and those bangs are probably nothing to do with the movements.
278040	282040	I think you guessed right, but try telling that to the movements.
282040	284040	We don't think it's like that at all.
290040	292040	Wonder if she's at home.
292040	294040	If she isn't, we can visit Alicia instead.
294040	296040	Better ask Alicia than the witch.
296040	298040	Anyway, she's more likely to tell us the truth.
298040	300040	Yes, you're right.
308040	311040	Look, you don't seem to realize this is a witch's house.
311040	313040	What do you mean by that?
313040	315040	I'll tell you what I mean.
315040	319040	What I mean is, I don't want to be seen talking with goody-goodies like the moments.
319040	323040	You think they'll ruin your reputation, is that why you're so worried?
323040	324040	Hmm.
326040	330040	Uh, there's just something very important we wanted to ask you.
330040	332040	And then we'll leave straight away.
338040	341040	That room upstairs, is that Alicia's?
341040	342040	It is.
342040	344040	Is Alicia there now?
344040	345040	No, she isn't.
345040	346040	Where did she go?
346040	348040	She went to get some wolf's vein.
348040	349040	When will she be coming back?
349040	351040	You're not going to stop her studying.
352040	357040	No, we wanted to ask her something about that loud noise we hear every night.
357040	359040	Ah, that one.
359040	361040	Hey, are you the one making the bangs?
361040	364040	I don't make explosions.
364040	365040	Who is it then?
365040	366040	I really don't know.
366040	368040	But why did you say that one then?
368040	370040	Because the explosions bother me, too.
372040	374040	You think they're coming from near here?
374040	377040	I think they're coming from far away from the sea, maybe.
377040	379040	That's what snuffkin' things, too.
379040	382040	Any sound from the sea echoes off Lonely Mountain,
382040	384040	so you think that's where it comes from?
384040	386040	Why is young man, a few days ago,
386040	389040	I went all the way over to the beach to see what was happening.
389040	392040	After a whole day's witching and casting magic spells,
392040	394040	one needs one sleep, you know.
394040	396040	So, what did you find them?
396040	397040	Nothing at all.
397040	399040	There was only one explosion that night,
399040	402040	so when I got there on my brun, there was nothing more to see.
402040	405040	Then we still have no idea who makes the bangs.
405040	408040	No, and I'm really upset you thought it was me.
408040	410040	When a witch creates an explosion,
410040	413040	it doesn't sound anything like a camel cough.
413040	415040	I can tell you.
415040	418040	Camel cough, I like that.
432040	435040	Thank you very much, Snork Maiden.
436040	439040	This year I want to grow some black tulips.
439040	442040	Is there really such a thing as a black tulip?
442040	444040	There's such a dark red, they look black.
444040	446040	Oh, I see.
446040	448040	Although it wouldn't really surprise me, Snork Maiden,
448040	450040	if there really were black ones somewhere.
450040	452040	We must ask the hamulineal now.
452040	454040	Oh, yes.
454040	457040	I know it's embarrassing, but I'm so excited.
457040	459040	I can't go to sleep at night.
459040	461040	Oh, I have no problem going to sleep at night,
461040	463040	but that noise wakes me up, Pamuline.
463040	464040	What noise is that?
464040	467040	I told you that noise.
467040	468040	Oh, I see.
468040	470040	You're talking about the explosion.
470040	473040	You know anything about it, Mr. Hemuline.
473040	475040	No, nothing at all.
475040	477040	No, those bangs are not what keeps me awake,
477040	479040	moment papa.
479040	482040	No, I'm waiting for a pie from the botanist federation.
482040	483040	Reply.
483040	486040	Yes, don't you remember a few months ago?
486040	489040	Housecrange, I thought I told you about it.
489040	492040	Well, I certainly told everyone else I know.
492040	495040	I sent them a brand new species.
495040	496040	New species.
496040	499040	I've never seen anything like it in my whole life.
499040	500040	A new wild orchid.
500040	503040	I'm so excited I can hardly speak.
503040	504040	Really?
504040	505040	A new wild orchid.
505040	507040	How very interesting.
507040	508040	Yes, isn't it?
508040	510040	Oh, it would be such a great honor for me
510040	513040	and for everyone else that they call it orchidokahemulinesis
513040	514040	or hemiliformis.
514040	516040	No, I'm sure they will.
516040	520040	So now you understand why I've had so many sleepless nights.
520040	522040	Yes, indeed.
522040	524040	Trouble is they should have answered by now.
524040	527040	Maybe they're still trying to decide what to call it.
527040	530040	Maybe they can't decide between orchidokahemulinesis
530040	533040	and orchidokahemuliformis.
533040	534040	Mmm.
534040	535040	Oh.
535040	537040	What is it?
537040	540040	Now I see at last I understand.
540040	543040	I am getting no reply from the botanist federation
543040	546040	because it is not a new species.
546040	550040	Oh, of course somebody's already found it.
550040	551040	Oh.
551040	553040	It is still too funny.
553040	555040	No, no.
555040	557040	Stupid I am.
557040	561040	This is the end of me as a scientist of course.
561040	562040	Calm down.
562040	564040	Don't upset yourself, Mr. Himulun.
564040	568040	Everybody will laugh at me and call me Mr. Himulinesis.
568040	570040	Now listen, Mr. Himulun.
570040	572040	The reply is a long time coming
572040	575040	because they must examine your plant most carefully
575040	577040	before making a decision.
577040	581040	They must read all the books first to be sure.
581040	585040	You really think so, Mum and Batman?
585040	587040	Could it really take so long, do you think?
587040	589040	Of course, these things take time.
589040	591040	When did you send it off?
591040	593040	A month ago.
593040	595040	There you are, that's no time at all.
595040	597040	You have to learn to be patient, Emulun.
597040	598040	You think so?
598040	600040	Oh, I feel better already.
600040	602040	Oh, I'm so glad you feel happier, Mr. Himulun.
602040	604040	Don't you worry, my friend.
604040	606040	Mama, great news dear.
606040	609040	Mr. Himulun has discovered a completely new plant
609040	611040	and is going to be called Himulinesis.
611040	614040	Oh, that's wonderful.
614040	616040	Congratulations, Mr. Himulun.
616040	618040	Oh, well, it isn't official yet.
618040	621040	No, they're just thinking about the name still.
621040	622040	Give them time.
622040	624040	We should have a party for Mr. Himulun.
624040	625040	Shouldn't we, Papa?
625040	626040	What?
626040	628040	Oh, yes, indeed.
628040	631040	When, Papa, tonight?
631040	633040	Hmm, let me think.
633040	636040	We should wait just a little bit longer perhaps.
636040	638040	Oh, why do you say that?
638040	641040	Mr. Himulun, you know that rare plant you found?
641040	643040	Does it have any flowers?
643040	644040	But, of course.
644040	645040	Are they pretty?
645040	647040	Very pretty.
647040	650040	Yes, just like you, Snorke Maiden.
650040	652040	Oh, Mr. Himulun.
652040	654040	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
655040	657040	Hey, look, Snorke Maiden.
657040	661040	Why don't we go and find out about those explosions tonight, huh?
661040	662040	All right.
662040	664040	You'll need me to find the way.
664040	665040	You want to come along?
665040	666040	You bet.
666040	668040	They come late at night.
668040	670040	I won't go to sleep, bad.
670040	672040	What do you think, Snorke Maiden?
672040	673040	I'm not sure.
673040	675040	Isn't there anything you can do to change your mind, movement?
675040	676040	I don't know.
676040	677040	Listen, little Maiden.
677040	678040	You have to be careful.
678040	679040	This could be dangerous.
679040	681040	Obviously, or I would.
681040	683040	Come, would I, spoil my sleep?
683040	685040	Well, stick close to us, then.
685040	686040	Yes, do that.
686040	688040	I also went down to the beach late last night
688040	690040	to try and find out what was happening.
690040	692040	And while I was there, I saw the witch flying around
692040	693040	on her broomstick.
693040	694040	Oh, really?
694040	697040	Why didn't you tell me so I could have come along?
697040	698040	I could hide better than you.
698040	699040	You're so white.
699040	700040	See, movement?
700040	703040	I'm not big in way like you.
703040	705040	Oh, there's someone coming.
705040	706040	Who?
707040	709040	Oh, there's someone coming.
709040	710040	Who?
713040	714040	It's Alicia.
714040	716040	Hey, Alicia.
716040	718040	Hi, Alicia.
718040	720040	Oh, my man.
720040	721040	Hey, Alicia.
721040	722040	How are you?
722040	724040	Have you three come here to play with me?
724040	727040	No, I'm afraid we have, but it's good to see you.
727040	729040	Yes, Alicia.
729040	730040	Yes?
730040	733040	Has your grandmother been kind to you since your last visit to us?
733040	734040	Very kind.
734040	736040	She's been treating me very well.
736040	738040	Ever since I stopped coming to see you.
738040	740040	Oh, good, but we do miss you, Alicia.
740040	742040	Oh, I miss you, too.
742040	744040	But I must keep my promise to her.
744040	746040	She'd be upset if I broke it.
746040	747040	What are these wings?
747040	748040	They're herbs.
748040	750040	Herbs are very important for a witch.
750040	752040	And frogs, bellies, and lizard stales.
752040	754040	They're important, too, of course.
754040	756040	I think that's licorice.
756040	757040	That's right.
757040	758040	Very clever, Snuffkin.
758040	760040	We use that for heartburn and coughs.
760040	762040	They smell quite nice.
762040	765040	And it also stops cows from giving their milk.
765040	766040	I see.
766040	768040	That's interesting.
780040	782040	Oh, it's a ride.
782040	784040	Hi!
790040	792040	Hello, Mr. Hillman.
792040	794040	Splendid days, eh?
794040	796040	Hello, Mr. Hamilton.
796040	798040	Don't you work so hard?
798040	800040	Yeah, I guess I do with that.
802040	804040	Wait, stop.
804040	806040	What is it, Mr. Hamilton?
806040	809040	My letter. I just want my letter.
809040	811040	There isn't one.
811040	812040	But why not?
812040	815040	You didn't have any yesterday or the day before.
815040	817040	Yeah, I know that. Nobody's written to you.
817040	818040	That's why.
818040	820040	Well, somebody should have written.
820040	823040	Are you quite, quite sure that you've gone through your bag properly?
823040	827040	Don't you know I'm expecting an important letter from an important scientist?
827040	829040	It must be in your bag.
829040	831040	Ah, all right, then. Go ahead.
831040	832040	What?
832040	835040	Well, you don't seem to trust me to do my job properly, Mr. Hamilton.
835040	838040	Go ahead. Have a look for yourself, then.
838040	840040	Oh, but of course I trust you.
840040	841040	Sorry.
841040	843040	No, no. You better have a look.
843040	844040	What do you think I do?
844040	846040	Steam them open and read them at night?
846040	847040	No.
847040	851040	Oh, you seem to have a lot of letters today.
851040	856040	Oh, I really think I should ask for a higher salary.
856040	858040	I deserve it.
858040	862040	I'm just starving.
862040	866040	I might have to go over and visit the moments in a minute.
871040	873040	Oh.
873040	877040	I'm sleepy, too. I could go on sleeping.
877040	879040	Oh!
879040	881040	What do you think you're doing?
881040	885040	Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
885040	888040	There's nothing else out here and you didn't see me?
888040	890040	I'm sorry.
890040	892040	Oh, dear. What does this matter with you?
892040	895040	Is this place called Moomin Valley?
895040	897040	Yes. That's right.
897040	901040	At last I found it. I never thought I'd really make it.
901040	904040	Excuse me. Are you all right?
904040	906040	Doctor me, miss.
906040	909040	Oh, tell me what's bothering you.
909040	912040	Oh, she's ill. She's got a fever.
912040	914040	Please leave me alone.
914040	918040	But you can lie here. You should be in bad young lady.
918040	920040	Do you know a man called Hamilton?
920040	924040	Yes. Have you walked all the way to Moomin Valley to visit him?
924040	928040	So I have come to the right place. He does live here.
928040	930040	Oh, yes. He lives very close to here.
930040	934040	I'm so glad I must see him immediately here.
934040	937040	Oh, what shall I do? I must do something.
937040	941040	Come here, someone. Someone help me.
941040	944040	Oh, my goodness.
944040	950040	Help! Anyone help! Help me somebody!
954040	963040	Papa! Papa!
963040	967040	He's up in the guest room if you want him. Mama's there as well.
967040	968040	What for?
968040	971040	I just rescued a girl, you know.
971040	973040	A girl? Did you sniff?
973040	977040	That's right. Very pretty too. She's ill and I put her to bed myself.
977040	981040	I'm going to see her. Me too.
981040	985040	I want another look as well.
985040	988040	First, we must bring her fever down.
988040	990040	I think you're right.
990040	993040	Yes?
994040	996040	Sniff just told us about her.
996040	998040	Oh dear, she unconscious.
998040	1000040	Yes. Where'd she come from?
1000040	1004040	We don't know a little, Maya, but Sniff said she'd come here to visit the hemeland.
1004040	1007040	That's right. Snort Maiden's gone to get him.
1007040	1009040	She's pretty, isn't she?
1009040	1011040	You're right. Very.
1011040	1014040	By the way, Moomin, what did the witch say?
1014040	1018040	Oh dear, must I really run like this?
1018040	1020040	Where is she visiting her young girl?
1020040	1023040	Well, if she's sick, why don't you give her some medicine?
1023040	1025040	I don't know any young girl's apart from her.
1025040	1028040	Don't. Just keep running.
1034040	1038040	I told you. I do not know this person. Maybe she's changed.
1038040	1042040	I've already told you. I have never known any young girls.
1042040	1045040	Then why do you think she'd want to come to visit you, hemeland?
1045040	1047040	She's a botanist.
1047040	1052040	And obviously she's heard of me and wants to come and see the famous hemeland for herself.
1052040	1055040	Oh dear, she can tell us when she wakes up.
1055040	1059040	We must leave her now so that grandma's medicine can work.
1065040	1066040	I think I'll be getting home.
1066040	1070040	Oh, we couldn't let you go just like that. Please stay and have some tea with us.
1070040	1073040	Thank you, but no, I have some plans to press.
1073040	1076040	And you're sure you're quite sure you don't know this girl?
1076040	1078040	Absolutely certain.
1078040	1081040	I really must go.
1084040	1086040	I'd forgotten all about the bangs.
1086040	1089040	Well, we haven't snuffed Ken and I. I'm going to look for them tonight.
1089040	1092040	I'd like to come too, but I can't.
1092040	1095040	I'm going with them. Are you snort maiden?
1095040	1098040	You'll be hiding on the beach in the middle of the night?
1098040	1102040	Yes, and then we'll rush off to where the bangs are coming from as soon as we hear them.
1102040	1103040	That's the plan.
1103040	1105040	Oh, I'd really love to come.
1105040	1109040	I'd rather go to bed. I'd be a bit scared of the beach in the middle of the night.
1109040	1112040	After all, it's my duty to stay here with Mum and Mama.
1112040	1114040	Are you coming, Sniff?
1114040	1117040	Certainly not. Not me.
1120040	1123040	This just occurred to me. That's why she's here.
1123040	1125040	Ah.
1135040	1139040	Here, you better take this moment. You might get very hungry.
1139040	1141040	Oh, thank you, Mama.
1141040	1144040	A midnight snack. I really envy you.
1144040	1146040	Well, Grandpa, why don't you come with us?
1146040	1148040	Oh, there's nothing I'd love more.
1148040	1151040	But I'd better not tonight. Right, Mama?
1151040	1153040	Oh, definitely not.
1153040	1157040	What would I do if something happened to the girl while you were away?
1157040	1158040	Exactly.
1158040	1161040	All right, Papa. We'll find out about the bangs for you.
1161040	1163040	Thank you, Momenta.
1171040	1173040	Good.
1173040	1178040	I think we should save this food for a while. We might have to wait a long time for the explosions.
1178040	1180040	Then they might not come tonight.
1180040	1184040	Stop stuffing yourself, Mum, and the rest is for a snuffkin and me.
1184040	1187040	But you can't eat anymore? Yes, I can.
1187040	1190040	We must share it in equal parts, otherwise it's not fair.
1190040	1193040	I think it should be shared in proportion to how big one is.
1208040	1210040	Hmm.
1220040	1222040	Hmm?
1222040	1224040	Oh, where did that come from? From the sea.
1224040	1226040	Keep a sharp lookout. Look over there.
1229040	1231040	What is it?
1231040	1234040	Uh-oh! Wow!
1234040	1236040	Oh!
1239040	1241040	That's what I call fireworks.
1244040	1245040	Come on!
1245040	1247040	Somebody must be out there in a boat!
1257040	1259040	There's a boat!
1259040	1262040	The fireworks must have come from there!
1262040	1264040	Hey! Come ashore!
1265040	1267040	Is that the henman you like?
1267040	1270040	No, I don't think so. It looks like him, but he was much younger.
1271040	1280040	And so as a result of their excursion to the beach, they finally learned that the big bangs that had been waking everyone up were fireworks.
1280040	1285040	They also learned that the fireworks were coming from a boat far out to sea.
1285040	1290040	But the man who had sent them up disappeared into the night.
1291040	1299040	They loved the laughter and they loved the living the movements.
1299040	1306040	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1306040	1310040	They're always happy and goes at play.
1310040	1317040	The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.
1317040	1321040	The movements.
1321040	1327040	The movements.
