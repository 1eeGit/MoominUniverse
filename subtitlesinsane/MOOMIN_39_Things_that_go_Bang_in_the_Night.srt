1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're here for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I think it's a good idea.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:38,640
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird,

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:01:06,000
sing that song ever, there were the movements, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement What? What? What?

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What?

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What?

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What?

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What?

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Big explosions could be heard in Moomin Valley almost every night and

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Moomin couldn't sleep a wink. Usually there was just one, but sometimes even two.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You heard it too, Mom and Papa.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes, those loud bangs are kicking me awake.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I wonder if there will be another one.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
They seem to be coming from the north.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hmm, he's sti-thought.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Or they could be coming from lonely mountains. If you ask me, I believe there is a work from the north. Hmm, he's stifled. Or they could be coming from lonely mountains.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,340
If you ask me, I believe they're the work of the witch.

26
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,180
The witch?

27
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,680
But witches don't make a lot of noise.

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Never know.

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,140
They're sneaky characters.

30
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,200
Tomorrow I'll have a few words with the inspector.

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,000
Except to him to put a stop to it.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,879
Papa, why would the witch want to make explosions?

33
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,159
Why not?

34
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,539
The first bang wakes me up and then I lie awake waiting for the second one which might not

35
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,919
come at all.

36
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,780
The bags might not come from movement value at all and they might be just an echo off

37
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,780
the mountains.

38
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,780
You think so?

39
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,780
Yes I do.

40
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,280
Well at least that's what Snuffkin thinks.

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,800
I mean the explosions might come from the sea.

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,280
That's what Snuffkin figured.

43
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,500
He thought it might be pirates or something

44
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,500
making the noises.

45
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,000
He's already had pirates and they went a long time ago.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,500
I'm plumping for the witch.

47
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,500
There's no doubt in my mother.

48
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Goodness, what are you doing out here?

49
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
We're waiting for another explosion, mama.

50
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
You're waiting vain, dear.

51
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
No, no, no, no, that moment, mama.

52
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Well, we had two explosions last night

53
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
and we've never had double explosions

54
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,000
for two nights in a row.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Until now, that is.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You heard that. It clearly came from over there.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Over there?

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, no. It certainly came from over there.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You couldn't mistake it. I'm sure of it. Good morning, Moon. Lovely day.

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Good morning, Snuffkin.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You look very sleepy.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So would you be opposed explosions that kept you awake for most of the night?

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Those explosions are really very hard, aren't they?

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They certainly are. Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Moment, Papa's convinced that she's the one who's going to be the best. Those explosions are really very odd, aren't they? They certainly are. Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Mum and Papa's convinced that she's the one who's making the bangs.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I think he's wrong there.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's what I thought, but there's nothing I could say to convince him.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So now I'm going to find out for myself.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You can certainly ask her, but do you really trust a witch to tell you the truth?

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Shhh. Do you the truth?

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Do you, a woman? But witches don't have to lie, Shirley.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Is that you, little my?

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And where are you two going?

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Little my!

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Are you trailing me full time or what?

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes, whenever you're sneaking off somewhere,

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm not sneaking, I'm just walking.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Well, I've never seen anyone walking in such a sneaky way.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Last time the witch tried to keep you from waging up, didn't she?

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So, so you think now she's trying to keep you from sleeping, eh?

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,399
Well, if she makes the explosions, it's always possible that someone else is the target.

83
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,600
We know very little about witches, and those bangs are probably nothing to do with the movements.

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,800
I think you guessed right, but try telling that to the movements.

85
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:50,500
We don't think it's like that at all.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,500
Wonder if she's at home. If she is, then we can visit Alicia instead.

87
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,300
Better ask Alicia than the witch.

88
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,600
Anyway, she's more likely to tell us the truth.

89
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Yes, you're right.

90
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,000
Uh-oh. Oh, oh, oh. Look, you don't seem to realize this is a witch's house.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What do you mean by that?

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll tell you what I mean.

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What I mean is, I don't want to be seen talking

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
with goodie-goodies like the moments.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You think they'll ruin your reputation

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
is that why you're so worried?

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hmm.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There's just something very important we wanted to ask you.

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm not sure if you're so worried? Hmm.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Uh, there's just something very important we wanted to ask you. And then we'll leave straight away.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That room upstairs, is that Alicia's?

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It is. Is Alicia there now?

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,680
No, she isn't.

104
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,639
Where did she go?

105
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,279
She went to get some wolf's pain.

106
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,800
When will she be coming back?

107
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,800
You're not going to stop her studying.

108
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,600
No.

109
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,199
We wanted to ask her something about that loud noise

110
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,560
we hear every night.

111
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,079
Ah, that one.

112
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,639
Hey, are you the one making the bangs?

113
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,240
I don't make explosions.

114
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,540
Who is it then?

115
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,939
I really don't know.

116
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,899
But why did you say that one then?

117
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:12,639
Because the explosions bother me too.

118
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,180
You think they're coming from near here?

119
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,220
I think they're coming from far away from the sea, maybe.

120
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,279
That's what's not can things do.

121
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,560
Any sound from the sea echoes off Lonely Mountain,

122
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,459
so you think that's where it comes from?

123
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:29,920
Why is young man? A few days ago I went all the way over to the beach to see what was happening.

124
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,959
After a whole day's witching and casting magic spells, one needs one sleep, you know.

125
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,000
So what did you find them? Nothing at all. There was only one explosion that night, so when I got

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
there on my brun, there was nothing more to see. Then we still have no idea who makes the bind.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No, and I really upset you thought it was me.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
When a witch creates an explosion,

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
it doesn't sound anything like a camel cough.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can tell you.

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Camel cough, I like that.

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:17,139
Ha ha ha ha ha! Thank you very much, Snork Maiden.

133
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:19,779
This year I want to grow some black tulips.

134
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,740
Is there really such a thing as a black tulip?

135
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,379
There's such a dark red, they look black.

136
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh, I see.

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Although it wouldn't really surprise me Snort Maiden if they're really

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
were black when somewhere.

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We must ask the hamuline you'll know.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh yes.

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I know it's embarrassing but I'm so excited I can't go to sleep at night.

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh I have no problem going to sleep at night but that noise wakes me up

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
hamuline.

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,959
What noise is that? I told you that noise.

145
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,240
Oh, I see. You're talking about the explosion.

146
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,959
You know anything about it, Mr. Himmela.

147
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,600
No, nothing at all.

148
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,720
No, those bangs are not what keeps me awake,

149
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
moment, Papa.

150
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,560
No, I'm waiting for a pie from the buttonest federation.

151
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,920
Reply.

152
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes, don't you remember a few months ago?

153
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:14,319
Housecrange I thought I told you about it. Well, I certainly told everyone else I know. I sent them a brand new species.

154
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:22,319
New species. I've never seen anything like it in my whole life. A new wild orchid. I'm so excited I can hardly speak.

155
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,800
Really? A new wild orchid, how very interesting.

156
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes, isn't it?

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, it would be such a great honor for me and for everyone else

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,399
if they called it Orchidaka emulences or emula formus.

159
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,000
No, I'm sure they will.

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So now you understand why I've had so many sleepless nights.

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,600
Yes indeed.

162
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,000
Trouble is they should have answered by now.

163
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,039
Maybe they're still trying to decide what to call it.

164
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,440
Maybe they can't decide between Orkidaka Hemulences

165
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,679
and Orkidaka Hemila Formis.

166
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,879
Mmm.

167
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,519
Oh.

168
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,039
Motorzard.

169
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,159
Now I see, at last I understand.

170
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,840
I am getting no reply from the botanist federation

171
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,000
because it is not a new species.

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, of course, somebody's already found it.

173
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh, it's just real funny.

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No, no, no, no, stupid I am.

175
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This is the end of me as a scientist of course.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Calm down, don't upset yourself, Mr. Himmiel.

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Everybody will laugh at me and call me Mr. Hemmuellences!

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Now listen, Mr. Hemmuellen, the reply is a long time coming because they must examine your plant most carefully before making a decision.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
They must read all the books first to be sure.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You really think so, Mum and Patna?

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Could it really take so long, do you think?

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Of course, these things take time.

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
When did you send it all?

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
A month ago.

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, there you are. That's no time at all.

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You have to learn to be patient, Emile.

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You think so?

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, I feel better already.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh, I'm so glad you feel happier, Mr. Emile.

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And don't you worry, my friend.

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,879
Mama, great news, dear.

192
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,159
Mr. Hemmulan's discovered a completely new plant

193
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:11,759
and is going to be called Hemmulansees.

194
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,320
Oh, that's wonderful.

195
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,519
Congratulations, Mr. Hemmulan.

196
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,759
Oh, well, it isn't official yet, you know.

197
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,399
Oh, they're just thinking about the name still.

198
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,559
Give them time.

199
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,639
We should have a party for Mr. Hemmulan.

200
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,840
Shouldn't we, Papa?

201
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,919
What?

202
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,840
Oh, yes indeed.

203
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
When Papa tonight?

204
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,120
Hmm, let me think.

205
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,200
We should wait just a little bit longer perhaps.

206
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,960
Oh, why do you say that?

207
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,440
Mr. Himmielin, you know that rare plant you found?

208
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,080
Does it have any flowers?

209
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,399
But of course.

210
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,000
Are they pretty?

211
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Very pretty.

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes, just like you, Snork Maiden.

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh, Mr. Amulin.

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh!

215
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Hey, look, Snorkkin, why don't we go and find out about those explosions tonight, huh?

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
All right.

217
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,039
You'll need me to find the way.

218
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,399
You want to come along?

219
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,360
You bet.

220
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:10,960
They come later tonight.

221
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:12,840
I won't go to sleep, Ben.

222
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:14,759
What do you think, Snuffkin?

223
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,960
I'm not sure. Isn't there anything you can do to change your mind, movement?

224
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,919
I don't know.

225
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,279
Listen, little Monk, you have to be careful.

226
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,679
This could be dangerous.

227
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:26,240
Obviously, or I wouldn't come, would I? It's well, my sleep. Well, stick close to us then. This could be janglerous. Obviously, or I wouldn't come. Would I, as well, my sleep?

228
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,840
Well, stick close to us then.

229
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,720
Yes, do that.

230
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,960
I also went down to the beach late last night

231
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
to try and find out what was happening.

232
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,360
And while I was there, I saw the witch flying around

233
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,679
on her broomstick.

234
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,559
Oh, really?

235
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,759
Why didn't you tell me so I could have come along?

236
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,559
I could hide better than you. You're so white.

237
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,600
See, movement? I'm not big in way like you.

238
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:48,799
Oh, there's someone coming.

239
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,799
Who?

240
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,799
It's Alicia.

241
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,399
Hi, Alicia!

242
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,799
Hi, Alicia!

243
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,399
Oh, my man!

244
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Hello, Alicia.

245
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,000
How are you?

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Have you three come here to play with me? No, I'm afraid we have it, but it's good to see you.

247
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yes, Alicia.

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yes?

249
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Has your grandmother been kind to you since your last visit to us?

250
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Very kind.

251
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
She's been treating me very well.

252
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Ever since I stopped coming to see you.

253
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, good, but we do miss you, Alicia.

254
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, I miss you too, but I must keep my promise to her.

255
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
She'd be upset if I broke it.

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What are these weeds?

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
They're herbs.

258
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Herbs are very important for a witch.

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And frogs, bellies, and lizard stales, they're important too, of course.

260
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I think that's licorice.

261
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's right. Very clever, Snuffkin.

262
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
We use that for heartburn and coughs.

263
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The taste smells quite nice.

264
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And it also stops cows from giving their milk.

265
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I see. That's interesting.

266
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Hey! Oh, it's a ride!

267
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Hello, Mr. Hillman splendid days. Hello, Mr. Hemmielin.

268
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Thought you worked so hard.

269
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah, I guess I do with that.

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Wait, stop.

271
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What is it, Mr. Hemmullen?

272
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
My letter. I just want my letter.

273
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There isn't one.

274
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But why not? You didn't have any yesterday or the day before.

275
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, I know that. Nobody's written to you. That's why.

276
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Well, somebody should have written. Are you quite, quite sure that you've gone through your bag properly?

277
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,600
Don't you know I'm expecting an important letter from an important scientist?

278
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
It must be in your bag.

279
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,600
Ah, alright then, go ahead.

280
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,840
Well, he don't seem to trust me to do my job properly, Mr. Hemuellen.

281
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,399
Go ahead, have a look for yourself then.

282
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,200
Oh, but of course I trust you. Sorry.

283
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
No, no, you better have a look.

284
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,960
What do you think I do? Steam them open and read them at night?

285
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,200
No.

286
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,600
Oh, you seem to have a lot of letters today.

287
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,559
Oh, I really think I should ask for a higher salary.

288
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,840
I deserve it.

289
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,440
Ah!

290
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,679
I'm just starving.

291
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,480
I might have to go over and visit the moments in a minute.

292
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,519
I'm sleepy too. I could go on sleeping.

293
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,519
What do you think you're doing? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

294
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,000
Hmm? There's nothing else out sorry. I didn't see you there.

295
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Hmm? There's nothing else out here and you didn't see me?

296
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh dear. What has this matter with you?

298
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Is this place called Moomin Valley?

299
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes. That's right.

300
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
At last I found it. I never thought I'd really make it.

301
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Excuse me? Are you all right?

302
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Doctor me, miss?

303
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh, tell me what's bothering you.

304
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Huh?

305
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, she's ill.

306
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
She's got a fever.

307
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Please leave me alone.

308
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But you can lie here.

309
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You should be in bed, young lady.

310
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Do you know a man called Hamilton?

311
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes.

312
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Have you walked all the way to Moment Valley to visit him?

313
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So I have come to the right place. It does live here.

314
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh yes, he lives very close to here.

315
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm so glad I must see him immediately here.

316
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh, what shall I do? I must do something. Come here, someone! Someone help me!

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh my goodness.

318
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Help!

319
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Anyone help!

320
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Help me somebody!

321
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Papa!

322
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He's up in the guest room if you want him. Mama's there as well.

323
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What for?

324
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I just rescued a girl, you know.

325
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
A girl?

326
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Did you sniff?

327
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That's right. Very pretty too. She's ill and I put her to bed myself.

328
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm going to see her. Me too.

329
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I want another look as well.

330
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
First, we must bring her fever down.

331
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I think you're right.

332
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes?

333
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Sniff just told us about her.

334
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh dear, she unconscious.

335
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes. Where'd she come from?

336
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
We don't know a little, Maya, but Sniff said she'd come here to visit the hemeland.

337
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,240
That's right, and Snort Maiden's gone to get him.

338
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,000
She's pretty, isn't she?

339
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,639
You're right, very.

340
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,919
By the way, Moomin, what do you think?

341
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,639
Oh dear, must I really run like this?

342
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,320
Oh, what a sophisticated young girl!

343
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,440
Well, if she's sick, why don't you give her some medicine?

344
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't know any young girl's apart from her.

345
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Don't tell them. Just keep running.

346
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I told you I do not know this person. Maybe she's changed.

347
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I've already told you. I have never known any young girls.

348
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,599
Then why do you think she'd want to come to visit you, Hamulin?

349
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,500
She's a botanist.

350
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,940
And obviously she's heard of me and wants to come

351
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,400
and see the famous Hamulin for herself.

352
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,079
Oh dear, she can tell us when she wakes up.

353
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:38,039
We must leave her now so that grandma's medicine can work.

354
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,000
I think I'll be getting home. Oh, we couldn't let you go just like that. Please stay and have some tea with us.

355
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Thank you, but no, I have some plans to press.

356
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And you're sure you're quite sure you don't know this girl?

357
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Absolutely certain.

358
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I really must go.

359
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'd forgotten all about the bangs.

360
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Well, we haven't snuffed Ken and I.

361
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,339
You're gonna look for them tonight. I'd forgotten all about the bangs.

362
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:08,099
Well, we haven't snuffed Ken and I.

363
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:09,579
I'm gonna look for them tonight.

364
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:12,220
Well, I'd like to come too, but I can't.

365
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,920
I'm going with them.

366
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,259
Are you snorkemaiden?

367
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:17,859
You'll be hiding on the beach in the middle of the night?

368
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:18,700
Yes.

369
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,700
And then we'll rush off to where the bangs are coming from

370
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,140
as soon as we hear them.

371
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,299
That's the plan.

372
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh, I'd really love to come.

373
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'd rather go to bed.

374
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'd be a bit scared of the beach in the middle of the night.

375
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
After all, it's my duty to stay here with Mum and Mama.

376
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Are you coming, Sniff?

377
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Certainly not. Not me.

378
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It just occurred to me that's why she's here.

379
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh. It's just a curtain to me, that's why she's here. Ah.

380
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Here, you better take this moment, you might get very hungry. Oh, thank you, Mama.

381
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
A midnight snack, I really envy you.

382
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,720
Well, Grandpa, why don't you come with us?

383
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,559
Oh, there's nothing I'd love more,

384
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,319
but I'd better not tonight, right, Mama?

385
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:13,440
Oh, definitely not.

386
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,799
What would I do if something happened to the girl

387
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:16,720
while you were away?

388
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,839
Exactly.

389
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,839
All right, Papa.

390
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:21,359
We'll find out about the bangs for you.

391
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:29,000
Thank you, Momenta.

392
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Ah. Ah.

393
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,400
Good.

394
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
I think we should save this food for a while.

395
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,200
We might have to wait a long time for the explosions.

396
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,599
And they might not come tonight.

397
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,400
Stop stuffing yourself, Momenta.

398
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,900
The rest is for snuffkin and me.

399
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,500
But you can't eat anymore?

400
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,700
Yes, I can.

401
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,700
We must share it in equal parts, otherwise it's not fair.

402
00:19:49,700 --> 00:20:22,700
I think it should be shared in proportion to how big one is. Oh

403
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
From the sea keep a sharp lookout! Look over there!

404
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What is it?

405
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Uh-oh!

406
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Wow!

407
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That's what I call fireworks!

408
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,039
Come on! Somebody must be out there in a boat

409
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:06,000
There's a boat the fireworks must have come from there. Hey, come ashore!

410
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Is that the hemuline you think?

411
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
No, I don't think so.

412
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It looks like him, but he was much younger.

413
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And so as a result of their excursion to the beach,

414
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
they finally learned that the big bangs that had been

415
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
waking everyone up were fireworks.

416
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
They also learned that the fireworks were coming from a

417
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
boat far out to sea,

418
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:46,000
but the man who had sent them up disappeared into the night. Leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

419
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
They're always happy and goes at play

420
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The movements are having fun day after day

421
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The movements, the movements, the movements The Moons
