    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Therefore you are your TV.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They are the movements.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So what do you think?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:38.640
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:56.000
sing that song ever, there were a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:10.000
there was a movement. All over the moon down, bits of paper were fluttering down.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Oh, we're so excited!

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm so excited!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's go slow!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
They were even falling over the lake.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What's this?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Oh, litter. There's some writing on that piece of paper.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I think it's a message.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Hmm, hmm.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Let's see.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Moment, theater presents, written by Moment Papa.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Moment, Papa.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The last children of Moment Valley.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Sarring Moment Papa, Moment Mama, and SNF

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and introducing Emma.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Emma?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I'm sure that's my ad.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.640
She works in a theater.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.920
Hmm. Admission fee? Anything edible.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.760
Yeah.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.159
They're putting on a play. So they can't be lost.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.040
Hmm. I haven't seen a play since I was a kid.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.159
It was wonderful. The best play ever.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.199
All about a princess.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.639
She fell asleep in a rose bush.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.039
She was so lovely.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:14.080
I've got to see that one again.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.800
But who will guard my prisoners, I wonder?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.919
I'm a good idea, officer.

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.439
You could take the three of us with you to the theater to see the play.

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.439
Good idea.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.599
We love the theater, so we won't try to run away

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.199
off as the red promise.

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:29.840
Hmm, not possible.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.599
I won't let you out of this jail until you write out

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.439
it's forbidden to burn signs 5,000 times each.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.199
That's the punishment for vandals.

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.240
Well, in that case, you won't be able to see the play.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.759
Ah, who cares?

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:45.000
Oh, well.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Yes, I must see it, I must go.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So you'll take us with you?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
No, you stay right here.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Well, then you can't go either, officer.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Quiet, you're upsetting me.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
No, no, this isn't good enough.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It's not true drama.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Ah, please, Moomin, Papa.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.599
I don't want to be just a lion's ugly behind. But, Sniff, I did give you another part.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.599
I don't want to be a baby either.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.000
And she said you wanted parts without lines.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Could you do the dusting a bit later, Emma, please?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
He's scripture be ready now.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
We have to start practicing for the opening night tomorrow morning.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Don't worry, Emma. It's coming along.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I'm only half done.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.599
I shall never get ready in time, woman mama.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.500
You're right to worry for the curtain will rise tomorrow, no matter what!

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.400
Huh! Huh! Huh!

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.099
I'm really not going to remember to give Emma lots and lots of lines.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.099
She's really looking forward to her first performance.

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.900
All right. Now leave me. I must be left alone to concentrate.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.960
The writer needs peace and quiet.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.159
There are some things I don't like about this script.

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.360
Well, I'll discuss it with you after the performance, Sniff.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.360
After.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.639
If it's a story about lost children, why do you have to have a stupid lion?

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.039
I'm too good an actor to be cast as a lion.

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.639
I'll keep them out of my hair when indeed he's giving me a headache.

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:05.280
You come with me, Sniff. I'll keep them out of my hair when indeed he's giving me a headache.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.599
You come with me, sniff.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.000
We'll practice our parts.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
This could be a wonderful play if you'd only skip the lions behind.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.319
I've heard enough about this behind.

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.639
Remember we have a lion's head too, dying to show his acting skills on the stage.

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.480
This is my play and I refuse to write out the lion's part.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.199
I refuse to write out the lion's bot. I refuse.

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:30.199
Here is the key.

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.959
I want you to keep a keen eye on them until I come back.

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:34.959
Do you understand me, cousin?

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:36.800
Are they very dangerous?

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.279
Yes, they certainly are.

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:39.839
They bite if you let them out.

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.319
Okay?

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.480
We certainly wouldn't bite anyone, officer.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.000
I've had enough of your lies.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Don't listen to my dear cousin, they do.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Well then, now I'm up to the theater to see the play.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Take good care of them while I'm gone.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.199
Excuse me. You seem to be a very good knitter. Oh, thank you.

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.120
Nobody ever said that to me before.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.439
I enjoy it.

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.160
What are you making?

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160
I'm not sure.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.680
I don't really know.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.160
Nothing in particular.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.959
It's just that knitting is so reassuring somehow.

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:27.759
Nothing bad can happen while you knit, can it?

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.560
The trouble is I always seem to forget to decide what to make before I start.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.600
But it feels nice and warm and I love the color.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.839
Couldn't you make socks? It's a very nice sock color.

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.199
Socks?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.000
Yes, it's very, very cold in here.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Oh, yes!

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
That's a very good idea.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Listen, if I needed each one of you a pair of warm socks, would you really put them on?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Of course!

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
That would be nice.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I'm almost freezing to death in here.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It's so very, very cold.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.319
Is it really that cold?

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:08.959
Yes, like tea's a chattery, so I could hardly talk.

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:10.120
Honestly.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.000
Oh, dear, oh dear.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.120
What should I do?

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.680
Maybe some steaming hot black currant juice

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.839
would help to warm us up a little.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:40.000
Possibly, although it might already be too late.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
My cousin would be very angry with me if he knew, but I think... What you think? What?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I think I'll let you out so that we can all be nice and warm indoors.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Really? Really?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Wait! Wait!

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Don't cry now, baby.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
There's a good boy. Don't cry, honey.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
That's enough, baby.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Whoa!

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Oh, moment mama, you need to show much more emotion.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Try to be more motherly and more loving.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Listen dear, this is a very heavy baby.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
How am I doing, moment papa?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:43.199
You're just perfect for the part sniffing your performance was excellent

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Look at these I think they might be ready by now. I hope they're tasty. They don't always come out very well.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
You're so kind! We've had so much already!

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
But they smell really delicious.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
They sure do!

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Thank you so much. Now I feel warm again.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
How about some more black currant juice?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Or maybe one of these freshly baked cookies?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It's very kind of you, but no thank you.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.439
I couldn't eat another thing.

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:08.920
I'm so full up.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.759
Me too.

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:13.639
Oh dear, the party is over then.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.920
I'm afraid so.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.639
It's really sad, but I have to lock you up again.

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:21.720
But at least I know your warm in there.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.279
We're real sorry too, but you don't need to worry

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:27.000
because actually we're not going back to jail.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.600
Oh aren't you?

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.000
We've got other plans. We're going to the theater to see my parents play.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.200
And I suppose I should say hello to my Aunt Emma who works there.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.200
Oh what shall I do? My cousin will be very cross with me.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.279
But you see we're innocent. We didn't do anything wrong. You didn't?

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:53.279
I swear it. Do I look like someone who pulls up signs in a park? We just burned some

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:57.960
flotsum left by the flood, but your cousin wouldn't believe it. He jumped to conclusions,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:06.799
wrongful arrest. That's all it was. Oh dear, why didn't you tell me that it was. Oh dear why didn't you tell me that it once? Oh people shouldn't go to jail

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:12.159
when they haven't done anything wrong. So we can go to the theaters that okay? Of course

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:16.559
better leave right away my cousin will be very disappointed but I guess I can't be helped.

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:25.600
Wait for me. I think I'd better come along and explain to that cousin of mine that his three prisoners are innocent of the charge against them.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
All right, all right, bring it in.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.399
That's right, Mumm, Bupa, stop there.

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:36.000
Okay, sniff.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.399
Mumm and Mama, what have you got there?

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.600
A baby's crib.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.600
I want to use this in the play.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.200
If that's all right with you.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.840
Mumm and Papa,, woman, Papa.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.279
I've just read your script, and I think you have a big problem.

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:52.039
Who is going to pay the parts of a woman and snort maiden

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:53.519
in this play of yours?

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:54.720
I don't know yet.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.399
We don't have any more children, and Sniff can't take the part.

00:09:58.399 --> 00:09:59.799
Are you utterly mad?

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.919
We only have a few hours before the curtain

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:04.879
goes up, and you don't even have ashes for all the parts.

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:05.000
What kind of director is that? Maybe one of us could stand behind something and sort of read their line. We only have a few hours before the curtain goes up, and you don't even have ashes for all the pot.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.500
What kind of director is that?

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.500
Maybe one of us could stand behind something

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.000
and sort of read their line.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
We did kill us!

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I did it!

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Let's hope the credits are proud.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Hold on tight, all of you.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Now!

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.919
Listen, kids. You can be as noisy as you like out here, but once we're at the dinner, you

00:10:29.919 --> 00:10:30.919
have to be quiet.

00:10:30.919 --> 00:10:31.919
You understand?

00:10:31.919 --> 00:11:15.000
You're right. The audience is waiting for us. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for giving up your valuable time in order to come to our show tonight.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
The world premiere of the Lost Children. This is a brand new company and the players never been performed before.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.740
Ladies and gentlemen, sit back and enjoy the superb acting.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.740
What's that?

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:27.740
A baby's cradle.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.740
It's for you, Sniff.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.000
For me?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.440
We sincerely hope you'll be thrilled by the originality of the plot.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.240
And so now dear friends, let's get started.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.240
Let's get started.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:42.980
Come on.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.980
Come on.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.000
Come on, come on! Come on!

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Oh, thank you, Sydney. There's a good boy. Don't cry, honey. Please don't cry.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:05.799
Hmm. A woman snorkemaid in my darling children. You've been lost for a whole month and we haven't heard a word from either of you.

00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:07.600
Oh, he's forgotten all about me!

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.600
Shh!

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.200
I'd give the whole world to be rid of this most terrible,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.799
agonizing despair.

00:12:14.799 --> 00:12:15.799
Ah, ah!

00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:16.799
Ah, ah!

00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:17.799
Ah, ah!

00:12:17.799 --> 00:12:20.000
Oh, I'll make your husband try not to fret,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.799
so I'm sure he'll be back before very long.

00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:26.200
Little children, come and free me from this plight.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.080
Your mother worries all day through the babies awake all night.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.799
Come home, come home, my children too.

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:35.080
With all our hearts we're missing you.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.679
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

00:12:38.679 --> 00:12:39.480
Mm-hmm.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.840
Loud or sniff?

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.919
Eh, eh, eh, oh, well, mama.

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:46.000
But what's wrong with you, Sniff?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
This rocket's making me sick.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Oh, dear, and right in the middle of movement, pop is play.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Oh, oh, oh.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Mama, let us set forth and find our loved ones.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
We cannot leave our baby here.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Oh, anyone would love to have him sweet little thing.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.360
For how long, pray, do you think we would be gone?

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.600
For as long as it takes, I can no longer stand

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.120
being this frightfully upset about my children.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.360
Oh, baby!

00:13:15.919 --> 00:13:16.440
Yeah.

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:24.120
Hurry up, sniff!

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
I'm trying! Hurry!

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Seen two is about to start!

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Help me somebody!

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I can't get out of here!

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
When do they put the princess on?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
We still have very far to go.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I'm afraid so hurry, Mumin!

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I am hurrying!

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
It's 4 p.m.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.600
It's 4 p.m. What are you writing on that that? My cousin won't give up, I'm sure.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:54.639
So I better ride this 5,000 times. It's for bitten. It's for bitten. It's for bitten.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.600
A full two weeks has passed. Oh, what shall we do?

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.000
Our dear children have disappeared from the face of the Earth.

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:10.000
Oh, what's happened, dear Apple, of my heart?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.519
I think I sprayed my hands really badly.

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:14.200
Oh, it hurts.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.080
If you were in trouble, apart from the wolves, we're all alone.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.279
I'll pull you out.

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:21.799
Oh, stop it, stop!

00:14:21.799 --> 00:14:23.919
Why must this happen in my theater?

00:14:23.919 --> 00:14:26.159
I've been squeezed in here to make me look smaller!

00:14:26.159 --> 00:14:26.759
Help!

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:27.679
I'm trying to!

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:30.320
We can't have the land on stage without his behind!

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.639
Wow!

00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:32.919
I'm so nervous!

00:14:32.919 --> 00:14:33.679
Come on!

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:34.960
Whoa!

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.960
We have to face the worst and spend the night right here in the wilderness.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.600
Dear husband, will it be all right?

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.000
Fairly in these unhulled woods, I feel quite queasy.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Sweet wife, I too can smell those frightful beasts,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
howling for a blood.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
May not just smell them, dear.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Anything that I can hear them now.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I can hear the howling of those hungry beasts.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.200
Painting is the roar, but I can make it out a lion!

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.799
Ow!

00:15:10.799 --> 00:15:12.799
Oh!

00:15:12.799 --> 00:15:13.799
Oh!

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:18.039
Oh, sniff, what's up?

00:15:18.039 --> 00:15:20.440
Where are you going, dear?

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:28.000
Oh, listen, I have to go and stop that stupid lion who's roaming around the countryside watching our every move.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Hey, don't worry, I'll be right back, my dear.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Was he supposed to say that?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Hey, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be on stage.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
It's not my father stuck in his crib.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Moment, mama, stuck on stage. Roll lion! I feel sick! Ah! What are you doing, moment papa?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
You can do it with a cradle on, sniff.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
No, I can't stop it! Please don't do it, moment papa!

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
They'll laugh at me out there!

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Don't worry! Nobody knows it's you hiding in there.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Come on now, hurry!

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Ah! A lion! A lion! Is this to be my most untimely end?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Don't you dare let me do it!

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Whoa! That lion can eat! Move it, Mama!

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Oh, no! what might you do? What should I do, Lauren Papa?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
I'm scared. Can't be quite to clear.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Let's run off across a stage here.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
We were supposed to run off together.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
The situation has changed.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I'll have to come to your rescue some other time here.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Oh, help me out!

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Oh, please don't work, please! Please, oh, now, ever again, I'm gonna be sick!

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Help me, please! Someone come quickly before I get killed!

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Oh!

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Coming, moving, mama!

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Come here, we got you!

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Oh, it's only snap!

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Little Maya, I'm so glad you're all right.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Shirley, weren't worried about me, Momma.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Well, just a little maybe, but you're such a lucky girl.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
I knew you'd manage.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Momma!

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
I don't believe it.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Momma, it's me, Momma!

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
And it's me, Snork Maiden!

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Momma! Momma!

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Momma!

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.839
Moment Snork Maiden, is it really you?

00:18:07.839 --> 00:18:09.720
Come here and let me see you!

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.559
We've come back, Mama!

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:16.599
I was dying to see you!

00:18:16.599 --> 00:18:19.200
Oh, it's wonderful to have you back.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.160
You're not my niece?

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.400
And Emma!

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.799
Oh!

00:18:23.799 --> 00:18:26.799
You look so grown up!

00:18:26.799 --> 00:18:29.299
And Emma, so sorry to have missed your show,

00:18:29.299 --> 00:18:30.599
but I have so much to tell you.

00:18:33.599 --> 00:18:34.599
Hi, everybody.

00:18:34.599 --> 00:18:36.400
That was a great performance.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.799
Snuff pin, I'm so glad to see you.

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:40.000
Glad you saved a movement.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Yay!

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Yay!

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.400
Those are my prisoners.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:19:06.000
They've escaped from jail. Catch them. B.A.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E.R.E. Very well! You are both under arrest! No! No! No! No!

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
We were these pretzel children.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Dear dear cousin.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Eh?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Eh.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
It's forbidden. It's forbidden.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Five thousand times. That's what you wanted.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
And are you sure there are five thousand?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Oh yes. Quite sure. I've counted them.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.680
Huh. One, two, three, four.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.680
Now that we are all together again,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.240
I would really like to go back to Moomin Valley.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.599
What shall we do with all these little pests, Nuffkin?

00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:34.640
Well, little Mai.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.319
Someone might like to foster them.

00:19:37.319 --> 00:19:39.519
You can leave them in my car, sir.

00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:41.240
You always am odd.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.039
Yes.

00:19:42.039 --> 00:19:43.960
Now I have some acting experience.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.000
I think I would like to start an acting school, exactly what this theater needs.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
What a good idea.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Do you think I would be too old to attend?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Perhaps character parts.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Like in my play.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
All is arranged for the best, so now we can go home.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
It is, Mom and Papa, I think it's high time.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Quiet, please, I've lost my cup.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Now I'll have to start again right from the beginning.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Mom and Papa, do you think we should thank the audience for their patience? Quiet, please! I've lost my cup! Now I'll have to start again right from the beginning.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Moomin Papa, do you think we should thank the audience for their patience?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Because they're still watching us, you know?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
No, you're right.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Ladies and gentlemen, that's all for tonight.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
I hope you have enjoyed the performance.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
I think it was very kind of you to stay to the very end.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
APPLAUSE

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Sometimes I could almost believe the truth is strange

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
and the fiction of it.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Where it is, isn't it, William Parker?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
No, not really. We writers are no better.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
I'll write more play.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Oh, what a very good idea, Moomin, Papa.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
I think you're as good with plays as you are with memoirs.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
What are you two?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Right, I'll start on the sequel as soon as we're all back home.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
There it is, I lovely home.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
At least I got a proper wash.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
I've never seen it so clean.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
What about in shine?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Oh, redecorated, probably.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Yeah. Let's go.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
The moving family spent the whole of the following week

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
making their house cozy and comfortable.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.059
And soon each carpet, each cup and saucer

00:21:26.059 --> 00:21:27.500
and every piece of furniture

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:47.000
was back in its proper place once again. We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
They're always happy and goes at play

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
The Moons are having fun day after day

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
The Moons

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
The Moons

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
The Moons The Moon, the Moon.
