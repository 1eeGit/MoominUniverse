515540,518540,"He's giving us a great send-off, though.",512700,515400,"SPEAKER_05"
518540,520540,"For Sniff, he should have come with us.",516300,520300,"SPEAKER_05"
525540,528540,"Nancy, I'm going off and leaving me here on my own.",525500,528700,"SPEAKER_06"
529540,530540,"Sniff.",529300,529500,"SPEAKER_06"
539540,541540,"Sniff can, if you wouldn't mind,",539300,545000,"SPEAKER_03"
541540,544540,"I think we need some music to send us on our way.",539300,545000,"SPEAKER_03"
544540,545540,"What do you say?",539300,545000,"SPEAKER_03"
559540,560540,"Sniff.",553500,558500,"SPEAKER_10"
568540,572540,"Are you sure we're on the right course with the island, Papa?",567900,567900,"SPEAKER_10"
572540,576540,"Yes, the winds with us and the sails are fine.",569100,572100,"SPEAKER_05"
576540,580540,"I bet if we keep this speed up, we'll be there by tomorrow.",573000,576400,"SPEAKER_03"
581540,585540,"Well, if the wind stays like this, you could be right.",576900,580000,"SPEAKER_05"
588540,591540,"The wind's not dying down at all.",581700,585900,"SPEAKER_03"
591540,594540,"I'm surprised. I never thought we'd keep up this speed.",581700,585900,"SPEAKER_03"
594540,596540,"Now, make sure you're allergic to them.",581700,585900,"SPEAKER_03"
596540,598540,"Of course we will be, Papa.",581700,585900,"SPEAKER_03"
598540,601540,"If we carry on like this, perhaps we'll see the light from the lighthouse",581700,585900,"SPEAKER_03"
601540,602540,"while it's still dark.",600700,602300,"SPEAKER_05"
602540,604540,"Well, we don't want to hit anything at this speed.",600700,602300,"SPEAKER_05"
604540,606540,"Don't worry. We're watching.",602800,608000,"SPEAKER_03"
606540,607540,"We're watching.",602800,608000,"SPEAKER_03"
607540,608540,"We're watching.",602800,608000,"SPEAKER_03"
608540,609540,"We're watching.",608000,614000,"SPEAKER_05"
609540,610540,"We're watching.",608000,614000,"SPEAKER_05"
610540,611540,"We're watching.",608000,614000,"SPEAKER_05"
611540,612540,"We're watching.",608000,614000,"SPEAKER_05"

614540,615540,"We're watching.",614300,616800,"SPEAKER_03"
615540,616540,"We're watching.",614300,616800,"SPEAKER_03"
616540,618540,"Don't worry. We're watching.",614300,616800,"SPEAKER_03"
618540,620540,"Ah, this is the life.",616800,618400,"SPEAKER_05"
626540,628540,"Papa, the wind's dropped.",618800,620300,"SPEAKER_03"
628540,630540,"Well, that's strange.",626800,628200,"SPEAKER_05"
630540,632540,"It shouldn't happen that quickly.",629300,632400,"SPEAKER_03"
633540,635540,"Do you want us to start rowing, Moomin, Papa?",629300,632400,"SPEAKER_03"
635540,639540,"No, Snuffkin. I think we'd all better get some sleep.",633800,639800,"SPEAKER_03"
642540,645540,"Stupid wind. I really wanted to see the lighthouse at night.",633800,639800,"SPEAKER_03"
646540,648540,"It's getting foggy too.",642700,646000,"SPEAKER_05"
648540,650540,"I can't even see the stars anymore.",648300,650200,"SPEAKER_05"
650540,653540,"Right, Snuffkin. Wake me in two hours, and I'll take over.",648300,650200,"SPEAKER_05"
653540,655540,"Okay, Moomin, Papa.",650600,653800,"SPEAKER_03"
670540,672540,"What's the matter, Little My?",665500,665800,"SPEAKER_00"
673540,675540,"I thought I heard something.",670700,672000,"SPEAKER_11"
675540,676540,"Oh.",675200,676400,"SPEAKER_07"
676540,679540,"It's coming from over there somewhere.",675200,676400,"SPEAKER_07"
679540,681540,"Can you see anything?",678000,679900,"SPEAKER_07"
682540,685540,"No, but I can hear it.",681300,682200,"SPEAKER_11"
687540,690540,"It's so good I, and it's getting closer.",685300,686200,"SPEAKER_07"
697540,698540,"Little.",688800,691700,"SPEAKER_11"
698540,700540,"Moomin, Papa. Get up, Moomin.",688800,691700,"SPEAKER_11"
700540,703540,"Stop it, Little My. What's the matter with you?",699300,699300,"SPEAKER_05"
700540,703540,"Stop it, Little My. What's the matter with you?",699300,701700,"SPEAKER_07"
703540,706540,"You too, Moomin, quickly, before it's too late.",701700,704000,"SPEAKER_05"
706540,708540,"What's the matter, Little My?",704600,707400,"SPEAKER_07"
708540,712540,"I can hear her ship. I can't see it, but it's very close, and getting closer.",707400,708700,"SPEAKER_03"
712540,714540,"A ship? Where?",708700,713400,"SPEAKER_07"
714540,716540,"Over there, and she's bearing down on us.",713400,714800,"SPEAKER_03"
716540,718540,"Quickly, we don't have much time.",715400,718900,"SPEAKER_11"
721540,723540,"Yes, by the boobalier right.",715400,718900,"SPEAKER_11"
723540,725540,"We must let them know we're here, a signal.",722100,729000,"SPEAKER_03"
725540,727540,"Right? All hands on deck.",722100,729000,"SPEAKER_03"
727540,730540,"Maybe if we all shout as loud as we can.",722100,729000,"SPEAKER_03"
731540,732540,"Look.",729000,730100,"SPEAKER_11"
740540,741540,"Too late for shouting.",735700,736300,"SPEAKER_11"
741540,743540,"It's huge.",740800,741900,"SPEAKER_07"
744540,747540,"Look out, it's gonna hit us.",741900,743100,"SPEAKER_05"
748540,750540,"I think Moomin's right. What can we do?",745200,747100,"SPEAKER_05"
750540,754540,"It's too late for anything. Just brace ourselves and be ready to swim for it.",749000,754600,"SPEAKER_03"
758540,759540,"Huh?",749000,754600,"SPEAKER_03"
759540,761540,"Quick, get down, Little My.",759100,761300,"SPEAKER_05"
772540,774540,"I don't believe it.",770300,770300,"SPEAKER_10"
774540,775540,"Little My.",773000,775300,"SPEAKER_04"
779540,780540,"Huh?",773000,775300,"SPEAKER_04"
781540,783540,"That's hard. The ship didn't hit us.",781400,783700,"SPEAKER_03"
783540,784540,"Oh, yes, he did.",781400,783700,"SPEAKER_03"
784540,785540,"What?",784000,785100,"SPEAKER_07"
785540,788540,"It went straight into our rudder when nothing happened.",785200,785600,"SPEAKER_03"
788540,790540,"It went right through us.",786100,790200,"SPEAKER_07"
790540,794540,"Right through us. That's impossible she couldn't have.",786100,790200,"SPEAKER_07"
794540,797540,"I wonder if there was anyone on board that ship.",794100,794200,"SPEAKER_03"
797540,799540,"I can't see any lights.",794700,796800,"SPEAKER_11"
799540,802540,"I know, Snuffkin. I think it's a ghost ship.",797800,799100,"SPEAKER_11"
802540,803540,"A ghost ship?",800200,802200,"SPEAKER_07"
803540,806540,"Well, there's no wash and no damage to us.",802800,803600,"SPEAKER_03"
806540,808540,"It's the only explanation. I think she's right.",804000,809200,"SPEAKER_03"
808540,811540,"A ghost ship. We've actually seen one.",804000,809200,"SPEAKER_03"
816540,821540,"Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I need to sit down. All this excitement's too much.",808900,811500,"SPEAKER_07"
821540,826540,"Papa, don't they say that if you see a ghost ship, something terrible is gonna happen to you?",819000,822900,"SPEAKER_03"
826540,830540,"What happened in the first place to make it become a ghost ship? That's what I wanna know.",823200,827900,"SPEAKER_05"
830540,837540,"Well, that's just some old sailor's tail, Moomin. If it had been a real ship, we'd probably be sinking now.",828300,832400,"SPEAKER_07"
837540,839540,"Don't you think so, Snuffkin?",832800,838400,"SPEAKER_03"
839540,842540,"Yeah, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.",839200,840800,"SPEAKER_03"
843540,846540,"Come on, cheer up you guys. At least it was fun.",841200,843500,"SPEAKER_11"
853540,856540,"What's the matter? Has something happened? What are you laughing at?",851200,852200,"SPEAKER_10"
856540,860540,"It's so funny. Are you going to tell us?",853700,858800,"SPEAKER_08"
856540,860540,"It's so funny. Are you going to tell us?",853700,854200,"SPEAKER_10"
860540,863540,"Why didn't you wake me up, Moomin?",859100,863100,"SPEAKER_08"
865540,868540,"Well, I think it would be very rude.",864200,864700,"SPEAKER_10"
869540,873540,"Oh, what a beautiful sky. Just look at it.",866000,867900,"SPEAKER_08"
873540,876540,"Oh, the fog is lifting.",869700,873600,"SPEAKER_08"
877540,879540,"Oh, I said, don't stop.",876400,877600,"SPEAKER_03"
900540,903540,"Another beautiful day, not a ghost ship in sight.",900100,903000,"SPEAKER_03"
907540,909540,"The lighthouse.",907500,909500,"SPEAKER_03"
911540,916540,"Hey, wake up everybody. The lighthouse. I can see the lighthouse. We're there.",911500,917200,"SPEAKER_03"
918540,921540,"Oh, the sun shining. We must have slept for hours.",918300,923200,"SPEAKER_08"
921540,923540,"Oh, there it is.",918300,923200,"SPEAKER_08"
924540,929540,"This is ridiculous. We've been next to it all night. We could have gone and slept there.",918300,923200,"SPEAKER_08"
929540,931540,"I can't wait to go ashore.",926100,929400,"SPEAKER_07"
931540,935540,"All right, everyone. Jump to it. Manly old.",929600,929600,"SPEAKER_07"
931540,935540,"All right, everyone. Jump to it. Manly old.",929600,931500,"SPEAKER_03"
940540,942540,"There's something strange going on here.",940500,942200,"SPEAKER_11"
942540,943540,"What is it, Snuffkin?",942000,943500,"SPEAKER_05"
943540,947540,"I'm not sure. Moomin Papa. Our boat didn't move at all last night. Did it?",942000,943500,"SPEAKER_05"
947540,950540,"No, it doesn't seem to have moved at all.",944000,950900,"SPEAKER_11"
950540,954540,"So why couldn't we see the light from the lighthouse, even when the fog cleared?",944000,950900,"SPEAKER_11"
954540,956540,"I can't work it out.",951100,955200,"SPEAKER_11"
956540,960540,"Yes, you're right, Snuffkin. It seems very odd. We should have seen it.",955200,956600,"SPEAKER_11"
961540,965540,"Well, perhaps the lighthouse keeper forgot to put it on, Moomin Papa.",958000,961300,"SPEAKER_03"
965540,969540,"I don't think so, little Mai. You can't forget a thing like that.",962000,965600,"SPEAKER_07"
969540,971540,"I suppose it could be broken.",965800,969200,"SPEAKER_03"
971540,978540,"There could be lots of reasons for it. Why don't we hurry up and get ashore, and then we can ask the keeper.",969900,971700,"SPEAKER_03"
982540,984540,"Look, there's someone in a boat.",972300,978000,"SPEAKER_08"
984540,986540,"Hmm.",983500,984600,"SPEAKER_07"
986540,988540,"It looks like he's fishing.",985200,985600,"SPEAKER_05"
989540,993540,"He knows about the lighthouse. He probably lives on the island.",986600,988000,"SPEAKER_05"
993540,996540,"Let's get closer. Easy now.",989700,993300,"SPEAKER_03"
1004540,1006540,"Hi there, good morning.",994200,996600,"SPEAKER_03"
1009540,1010540,"Any luck?",1004800,1006900,"SPEAKER_03"
1012540,1014540,"Not yet, but it's still early.",1012500,1014500,"SPEAKER_02"
1015540,1019540,"Hmm, yes, quite. I'll ask him straight out.",1012500,1014500,"SPEAKER_02"
1019540,1023540,"Do you know if the lighthouse was working last night?",1017000,1017000,"SPEAKER_02"
1019540,1023540,"Do you know if the lighthouse was working last night?",1017000,1023800,"SPEAKER_03"
1023540,1027540,"I don't know. Sorry, I didn't catch that.",1017000,1017000,"SPEAKER_02"
1023540,1027540,"I don't know. Sorry, I didn't catch that.",1017000,1023800,"SPEAKER_03"
1029540,1032540,"He said, no, it wasn't.",1028100,1028100,"SPEAKER_01"
1032540,1034540,"What did I tell you? He forgot to light it.",1030600,1030600,"SPEAKER_03"
1032540,1034540,"What did I tell you? He forgot to light it.",1030600,1032700,"SPEAKER_01"
1034540,1040540,"Oh, it wasn't only last night. You'll never see a light in that lighthouse, not even on stormy nights.",1032800,1035000,"SPEAKER_07"
1041540,1044540,"Never. So what does the keeper do then?",1041100,1044400,"SPEAKER_03"
1044540,1047540,"Nothing. There isn't a lighthouse keeper.",1041100,1044400,"SPEAKER_03"
1047540,1049540,"Why?",1047500,1048900,"SPEAKER_03"
1049540,1054540,"I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't know. All I can say is I haven't seen one.",1049300,1053600,"SPEAKER_01"
1054540,1056540,"Do you live on the island?",1049300,1053600,"SPEAKER_01"
1056540,1062540,"Hey, mister. You're asking too many questions. Who are you?",1054600,1056100,"SPEAKER_02"
1062540,1066540,"I'm Moment Papa from Moment Valley, and this is my family.",1062200,1062700,"SPEAKER_03"
1066540,1069540,"We've come a long way in order to do some important work here.",1063000,1068200,"SPEAKER_03"
1069540,1073540,"No work on this island. No, you better go back home.",1068200,1073000,"SPEAKER_02"
1073540,1078540,"You see, I've come here to research an epic novel about the sea.",1073500,1081400,"SPEAKER_02"
1078540,1082540,"Just turn around and go back. You're too far from home.",1073500,1081400,"SPEAKER_02"
1082540,1084540,"Oh, please, wait!",1073500,1081400,"SPEAKER_02"
1084540,1088540,"Shh, dear. Don't shout. We mustn't scare the fish away.",1083000,1085400,"SPEAKER_02"
1088540,1092540,"Let's go ashore and have some breakfast. I expect we're all hungry.",1085400,1088600,"SPEAKER_08"
1100540,1104540,"Bonnie, pair. The old ones lost his marbles.",1089300,1092500,"SPEAKER_08"
1123540,1127540,"Look, Moment Papa. There's a path there leading to the lighthouse.",1101200,1104200,"SPEAKER_07"
1128540,1131540,"We'll leave this stuff here and we'll go and explore it first.",1124100,1126900,"SPEAKER_11"
1131540,1134540,"Right. To the lighthouse, everyone. Up.",1128700,1134600,"SPEAKER_03"
1134540,1135540,"Oh!",1128700,1134600,"SPEAKER_03"
1135540,1137540,"Come on!",1128700,1134600,"SPEAKER_03"
1139540,1143540,"What's wrong? Why do you always get so upset when somebody mentions the lighthouse?",1128700,1134600,"SPEAKER_03"
1143540,1147540,"It's not your call, sir. Business boy doesn't concern you at all.",1139700,1144000,"SPEAKER_01"
1147540,1151540,"You were like that when I asked you about it before. Maybe if you were to tell me,",1144600,1147800,"SPEAKER_02"
1151540,1154540,"I might be able to understand. I could try anyway.",1147800,1154900,"SPEAKER_01"
1155540,1159540,"Either talk about something else or keep quiet. Do you understand that?",1155400,1158400,"SPEAKER_02"
1174540,1177540,"It's so very rocky. I don't think it would work. What?",1155400,1158400,"SPEAKER_02"
