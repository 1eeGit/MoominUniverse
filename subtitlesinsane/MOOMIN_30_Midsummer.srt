1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Therefore you are your TV.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So what do you think?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I think it's a good idea.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I think it's a good idea.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I think it's a good idea.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I think it's a good idea.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I think it's a good idea.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I think it's a good idea.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

15
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:38,640
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird,

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:56,000
sing that song ever, there were a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:10,000
there was a movement. All over the moon down, bits of paper were fluttering down.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, we're so excited!

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm so excited!

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's go slow!

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
They were even falling over the lake.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What's this?

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, litter. There's some writing on that piece of paper.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I think it's a message.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hmm, hmm.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's see.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Moment, theater presents, written by Moment Papa.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Moment, Papa.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The last children of Moment Valley.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Sarring Moment Papa, Moment Mama, and SNF

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and introducing Emma.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Emma?

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sure that's my ad.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,640
She works in a theater.

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,920
Hmm. Admission fee? Anything edible.

36
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,760
Yeah.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,159
They're putting on a play. So they can't be lost.

38
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,040
Hmm. I haven't seen a play since I was a kid.

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,159
It was wonderful. The best play ever.

40
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,199
All about a princess.

41
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,639
She fell asleep in a rose bush.

42
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,039
She was so lovely.

43
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,080
I've got to see that one again.

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,800
But who will guard my prisoners, I wonder?

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,919
I'm a good idea, officer.

46
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,439
You could take the three of us with you to the theater to see the play.

47
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,439
Good idea.

48
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,599
We love the theater, so we won't try to run away

49
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,199
off as the red promise.

50
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,840
Hmm, not possible.

51
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,599
I won't let you out of this jail until you write out

52
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,439
it's forbidden to burn signs 5,000 times each.

53
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:39,199
That's the punishment for vandals.

54
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,240
Well, in that case, you won't be able to see the play.

55
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,759
Ah, who cares?

56
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, well.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes, I must see it, I must go.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So you'll take us with you?

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No, you stay right here.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, then you can't go either, officer.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Quiet, you're upsetting me.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No, no, this isn't good enough.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's not true drama.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Ah, please, Moomin, Papa.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,599
I don't want to be just a lion's ugly behind. But, Sniff, I did give you another part.

66
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,599
I don't want to be a baby either.

67
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:11,000
And she said you wanted parts without lines.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Could you do the dusting a bit later, Emma, please?

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He's scripture be ready now.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We have to start practicing for the opening night tomorrow morning.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't worry, Emma. It's coming along.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm only half done.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,599
I shall never get ready in time, woman mama.

74
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,500
You're right to worry for the curtain will rise tomorrow, no matter what!

75
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,400
Huh! Huh! Huh!

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,099
I'm really not going to remember to give Emma lots and lots of lines.

77
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,099
She's really looking forward to her first performance.

78
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:43,900
All right. Now leave me. I must be left alone to concentrate.

79
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,960
The writer needs peace and quiet.

80
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,159
There are some things I don't like about this script.

81
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,360
Well, I'll discuss it with you after the performance, Sniff.

82
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
After.

83
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,639
If it's a story about lost children, why do you have to have a stupid lion?

84
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:01,039
I'm too good an actor to be cast as a lion.

85
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,639
I'll keep them out of my hair when indeed he's giving me a headache.

86
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,280
You come with me, Sniff. I'll keep them out of my hair when indeed he's giving me a headache.

87
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,599
You come with me, sniff.

88
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,000
We'll practice our parts.

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This could be a wonderful play if you'd only skip the lions behind.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,319
I've heard enough about this behind.

91
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:20,639
Remember we have a lion's head too, dying to show his acting skills on the stage.

92
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,480
This is my play and I refuse to write out the lion's part.

93
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,199
I refuse to write out the lion's bot. I refuse.

94
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,199
Here is the key.

95
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,959
I want you to keep a keen eye on them until I come back.

96
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,959
Do you understand me, cousin?

97
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,800
Are they very dangerous?

98
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,279
Yes, they certainly are.

99
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,839
They bite if you let them out.

100
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,319
Okay?

101
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,480
We certainly wouldn't bite anyone, officer.

102
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,000
I've had enough of your lies.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't listen to my dear cousin, they do.

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well then, now I'm up to the theater to see the play.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Take good care of them while I'm gone.

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,199
Excuse me. You seem to be a very good knitter. Oh, thank you.

107
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,120
Nobody ever said that to me before.

108
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,439
I enjoy it.

109
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,160
What are you making?

110
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
I'm not sure.

111
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,680
I don't really know.

112
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,160
Nothing in particular.

113
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,959
It's just that knitting is so reassuring somehow.

114
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,759
Nothing bad can happen while you knit, can it?

115
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,560
The trouble is I always seem to forget to decide what to make before I start.

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,600
But it feels nice and warm and I love the color.

117
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,839
Couldn't you make socks? It's a very nice sock color.

118
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,199
Socks?

119
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes, it's very, very cold in here.

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, yes!

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's a very good idea.

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Listen, if I needed each one of you a pair of warm socks, would you really put them on?

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Of course!

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That would be nice.

125
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm almost freezing to death in here.

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's so very, very cold.

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,319
Is it really that cold?

128
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,959
Yes, like tea's a chattery, so I could hardly talk.

129
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,120
Honestly.

130
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, dear, oh dear.

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,120
What should I do?

132
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,680
Maybe some steaming hot black currant juice

133
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,839
would help to warm us up a little.

134
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:40,000
Possibly, although it might already be too late.

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
My cousin would be very angry with me if he knew, but I think... What you think? What?

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think I'll let you out so that we can all be nice and warm indoors.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Really? Really?

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wait! Wait!

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't cry now, baby.

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
There's a good boy. Don't cry, honey.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's enough, baby.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Whoa!

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, moment mama, you need to show much more emotion.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Try to be more motherly and more loving.

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Listen dear, this is a very heavy baby.

146
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
How am I doing, moment papa?

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:43,199
You're just perfect for the part sniffing your performance was excellent

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Look at these I think they might be ready by now. I hope they're tasty. They don't always come out very well.

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You're so kind! We've had so much already!

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But they smell really delicious.

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They sure do!

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Thank you so much. Now I feel warm again.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
How about some more black currant juice?

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Or maybe one of these freshly baked cookies?

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's very kind of you, but no thank you.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,439
I couldn't eat another thing.

157
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,920
I'm so full up.

158
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,759
Me too.

159
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,639
Oh dear, the party is over then.

160
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm afraid so.

161
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,639
It's really sad, but I have to lock you up again.

162
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,720
But at least I know your warm in there.

163
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,279
We're real sorry too, but you don't need to worry

164
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,000
because actually we're not going back to jail.

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,600
Oh aren't you?

166
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,000
We've got other plans. We're going to the theater to see my parents play.

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,200
And I suppose I should say hello to my Aunt Emma who works there.

168
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Oh what shall I do? My cousin will be very cross with me.

169
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,279
But you see we're innocent. We didn't do anything wrong. You didn't?

170
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,279
I swear it. Do I look like someone who pulls up signs in a park? We just burned some

171
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,960
flotsum left by the flood, but your cousin wouldn't believe it. He jumped to conclusions,

172
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:06,799
wrongful arrest. That's all it was. Oh dear, why didn't you tell me that it was. Oh dear why didn't you tell me that it once? Oh people shouldn't go to jail

173
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:12,159
when they haven't done anything wrong. So we can go to the theaters that okay? Of course

174
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,559
better leave right away my cousin will be very disappointed but I guess I can't be helped.

175
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:25,600
Wait for me. I think I'd better come along and explain to that cousin of mine that his three prisoners are innocent of the charge against them.

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
All right, all right, bring it in.

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,399
That's right, Mumm, Bupa, stop there.

178
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay, sniff.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,399
Mumm and Mama, what have you got there?

180
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,600
A baby's crib.

181
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
I want to use this in the play.

182
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
If that's all right with you.

183
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,840
Mumm and Papa,, woman, Papa.

184
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,279
I've just read your script, and I think you have a big problem.

185
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,039
Who is going to pay the parts of a woman and snort maiden

186
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,519
in this play of yours?

187
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,720
I don't know yet.

188
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,399
We don't have any more children, and Sniff can't take the part.

189
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,799
Are you utterly mad?

190
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,919
We only have a few hours before the curtain

191
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,879
goes up, and you don't even have ashes for all the parts.

192
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,000
What kind of director is that? Maybe one of us could stand behind something and sort of read their line. We only have a few hours before the curtain goes up, and you don't even have ashes for all the pot.

193
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,500
What kind of director is that?

194
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Maybe one of us could stand behind something

195
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,000
and sort of read their line.

196
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We did kill us!

197
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I did it!

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let's hope the credits are proud.

199
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hold on tight, all of you.

200
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Now!

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,919
Listen, kids. You can be as noisy as you like out here, but once we're at the dinner, you

202
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,919
have to be quiet.

203
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,919
You understand?

204
00:10:31,919 --> 00:11:15,000
You're right. The audience is waiting for us. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for giving up your valuable time in order to come to our show tonight.

205
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The world premiere of the Lost Children. This is a brand new company and the players never been performed before.

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,740
Ladies and gentlemen, sit back and enjoy the superb acting.

207
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
What's that?

208
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
A baby's cradle.

209
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,740
It's for you, Sniff.

210
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,000
For me?

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,440
We sincerely hope you'll be thrilled by the originality of the plot.

212
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,240
And so now dear friends, let's get started.

213
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
Let's get started.

214
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,980
Come on.

215
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,980
Come on.

216
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,000
Come on, come on! Come on!

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh, thank you, Sydney. There's a good boy. Don't cry, honey. Please don't cry.

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,799
Hmm. A woman snorkemaid in my darling children. You've been lost for a whole month and we haven't heard a word from either of you.

219
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,600
Oh, he's forgotten all about me!

220
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Shh!

221
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,200
I'd give the whole world to be rid of this most terrible,

222
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,799
agonizing despair.

223
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,799
Ah, ah!

224
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,799
Ah, ah!

225
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,799
Ah, ah!

226
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, I'll make your husband try not to fret,

227
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,799
so I'm sure he'll be back before very long.

228
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,200
Little children, come and free me from this plight.

229
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,080
Your mother worries all day through the babies awake all night.

230
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,799
Come home, come home, my children too.

231
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,080
With all our hearts we're missing you.

232
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,679
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

233
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,480
Mm-hmm.

234
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,840
Loud or sniff?

235
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,919
Eh, eh, eh, oh, well, mama.

236
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,000
But what's wrong with you, Sniff?

237
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
This rocket's making me sick.

238
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh, dear, and right in the middle of movement, pop is play.

239
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Oh, oh, oh.

240
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Mama, let us set forth and find our loved ones.

241
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We cannot leave our baby here.

242
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Oh, anyone would love to have him sweet little thing.

243
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,360
For how long, pray, do you think we would be gone?

244
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,600
For as long as it takes, I can no longer stand

245
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,120
being this frightfully upset about my children.

246
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,360
Oh, baby!

247
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:16,440
Yeah.

248
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,120
Hurry up, sniff!

249
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm trying! Hurry!

250
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Seen two is about to start!

251
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Help me somebody!

252
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I can't get out of here!

253
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
When do they put the princess on?

254
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We still have very far to go.

255
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm afraid so hurry, Mumin!

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I am hurrying!

257
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's 4 p.m.

258
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,600
It's 4 p.m. What are you writing on that that? My cousin won't give up, I'm sure.

259
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,639
So I better ride this 5,000 times. It's for bitten. It's for bitten. It's for bitten.

260
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,600
A full two weeks has passed. Oh, what shall we do?

261
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,000
Our dear children have disappeared from the face of the Earth.

262
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, what's happened, dear Apple, of my heart?

263
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,519
I think I sprayed my hands really badly.

264
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,200
Oh, it hurts.

265
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,080
If you were in trouble, apart from the wolves, we're all alone.

266
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,279
I'll pull you out.

267
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,799
Oh, stop it, stop!

268
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,919
Why must this happen in my theater?

269
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:26,159
I've been squeezed in here to make me look smaller!

270
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:26,759
Help!

271
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,679
I'm trying to!

272
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,320
We can't have the land on stage without his behind!

273
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,639
Wow!

274
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,919
I'm so nervous!

275
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,679
Come on!

276
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,960
Whoa!

277
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,960
We have to face the worst and spend the night right here in the wilderness.

278
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,600
Dear husband, will it be all right?

279
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,000
Fairly in these unhulled woods, I feel quite queasy.

280
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Sweet wife, I too can smell those frightful beasts,

281
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
howling for a blood.

282
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
May not just smell them, dear.

283
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Anything that I can hear them now.

284
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I can hear the howling of those hungry beasts.

285
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,200
Painting is the roar, but I can make it out a lion!

286
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,799
Ow!

287
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,799
Oh!

288
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,799
Oh!

289
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,039
Oh, sniff, what's up?

290
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,440
Where are you going, dear?

291
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, listen, I have to go and stop that stupid lion who's roaming around the countryside watching our every move.

292
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Hey, don't worry, I'll be right back, my dear.

293
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Was he supposed to say that?

294
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Hey, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be on stage.

295
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's not my father stuck in his crib.

296
00:15:40,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Moment, mama, stuck on stage. Roll lion! I feel sick! Ah! What are you doing, moment papa?

297
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You can do it with a cradle on, sniff.

298
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
No, I can't stop it! Please don't do it, moment papa!

299
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
They'll laugh at me out there!

300
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Don't worry! Nobody knows it's you hiding in there.

301
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Come on now, hurry!

302
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Ah! A lion! A lion! Is this to be my most untimely end?

303
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't you dare let me do it!

304
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Whoa! That lion can eat! Move it, Mama!

305
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh, no! what might you do? What should I do, Lauren Papa?

306
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm scared. Can't be quite to clear.

307
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Let's run off across a stage here.

308
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
We were supposed to run off together.

309
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The situation has changed.

310
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll have to come to your rescue some other time here.

311
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh, help me out!

312
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh, please don't work, please! Please, oh, now, ever again, I'm gonna be sick!

313
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Help me, please! Someone come quickly before I get killed!

314
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Oh!

315
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Coming, moving, mama!

316
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Come here, we got you!

317
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, it's only snap!

318
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Little Maya, I'm so glad you're all right.

319
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Shirley, weren't worried about me, Momma.

320
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Well, just a little maybe, but you're such a lucky girl.

321
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I knew you'd manage.

322
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Momma!

323
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't believe it.

324
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Momma, it's me, Momma!

325
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And it's me, Snork Maiden!

326
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Momma! Momma!

327
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Momma!

328
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,839
Moment Snork Maiden, is it really you?

329
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,720
Come here and let me see you!

330
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,559
We've come back, Mama!

331
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,599
I was dying to see you!

332
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:19,200
Oh, it's wonderful to have you back.

333
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,160
You're not my niece?

334
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,400
And Emma!

335
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,799
Oh!

336
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,799
You look so grown up!

337
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,299
And Emma, so sorry to have missed your show,

338
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:30,599
but I have so much to tell you.

339
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,599
Hi, everybody.

340
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,400
That was a great performance.

341
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,799
Snuff pin, I'm so glad to see you.

342
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,000
Glad you saved a movement.

343
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yay!

344
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yay!

345
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,400
Those are my prisoners.

346
00:18:44,400 --> 00:19:06,000
They've escaped from jail. Catch them.

Very well! You are both under arrest! No! No! No! No!

347
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We were these pretzel children.

348
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Dear dear cousin.

349
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Eh?

350
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Eh.

351
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's forbidden. It's forbidden.

352
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Five thousand times. That's what you wanted.

353
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And are you sure there are five thousand?

354
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh yes. Quite sure. I've counted them.

355
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,680
Huh. One, two, three, four.

356
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
Now that we are all together again,

357
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,240
I would really like to go back to Moomin Valley.

358
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,599
What shall we do with all these little pests, Nuffkin?

359
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,640
Well, little Mai.

360
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,319
Someone might like to foster them.

361
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:39,519
You can leave them in my car, sir.

362
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,240
You always am odd.

363
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,039
Yes.

364
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,960
Now I have some acting experience.

365
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,000
I think I would like to start an acting school, exactly what this theater needs.

366
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What a good idea.

367
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Do you think I would be too old to attend?

368
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Perhaps character parts.

369
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Like in my play.

370
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
All is arranged for the best, so now we can go home.

371
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It is, Mom and Papa, I think it's high time.

372
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Quiet, please, I've lost my cup.

373
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Now I'll have to start again right from the beginning.

374
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Mom and Papa, do you think we should thank the audience for their patience? Quiet, please! I've lost my cup! Now I'll have to start again right from the beginning.

375
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Moomin Papa, do you think we should thank the audience for their patience?

376
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Because they're still watching us, you know?

377
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
No, you're right.

378
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Ladies and gentlemen, that's all for tonight.

379
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I hope you have enjoyed the performance.

380
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I think it was very kind of you to stay to the very end.

381
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
APPLAUSE

382
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Sometimes I could almost believe the truth is strange

383
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
and the fiction of it.

384
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Where it is, isn't it, William Parker?

385
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
No, not really. We writers are no better.

386
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'll write more play.

387
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Oh, what a very good idea, Moomin, Papa.

388
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I think you're as good with plays as you are with memoirs.

389
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What are you two?

390
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Right, I'll start on the sequel as soon as we're all back home.

391
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
There it is, I lovely home.

392
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
At least I got a proper wash.

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I've never seen it so clean.

394
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What about in shine?

395
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh, redecorated, probably.

396
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah. Let's go.

397
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The moving family spent the whole of the following week

398
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
making their house cozy and comfortable.

399
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,059
And soon each carpet, each cup and saucer

400
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:27,500
and every piece of furniture

401
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:47,000
was back in its proper place once again. We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

402
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
They're always happy and goes at play

403
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The Moons are having fun day after day

404
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The Moons

405
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The Moons

406
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The Moons The Moon, the Moon.
