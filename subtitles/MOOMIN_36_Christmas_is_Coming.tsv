0	21000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.
29000	35000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.
35000	46000	You can fly just like a bird, sing the best song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,
46000	62000	there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.
62000	70000	The snow was getting thicker on the ground and it was high time for the movements to start hibernating.
76000	98000	What are you doing now man, Alicia? What are you doing with these pine needles? That's what we always eat before we hibernate nobody knows why.
98000	104000	So you're going to start hibernating? Yes tonight. Oh that's soon? Yes.
104000	110000	I'm so glad I've come to see you today instead of leaving until tomorrow then.
110000	118000	I must say you came on just the right day, Alicia. We usually have a small party the night we start hibernating and you've arrived just in time.
118000	121000	Oh you mean I can stay for that woman, Mama?
121000	127000	And by the way Alicia is a matter of interest, is the witch, sorry your grandmother I mean, know that you're here?
127000	131000	No I'm afraid I didn't tell her, better for grownups not to know too much.
131000	133000	Oh do you say you're right?
133000	137000	I'm afraid she's not very happy for me to come here to move in valley.
137000	139000	Why ever not my dear?
139000	144000	I guess she's afraid that if I start coming here to play I shall lose interest in studying hard at my witchcraft.
144000	148000	Oh but you've got a very long time to go before you're a witch?
148000	152000	It takes anything between five to seven years nowadays.
152000	155000	Are you really sure that's what you want to be Alicia?
155000	158000	Study something out. But I want to be a witch.
158000	161000	Perhaps you don't know but witches aren't terribly popular.
161000	166000	Yes I do but I won't be like that, I'll be popular.
166000	172000	Hey, stop here.
172000	174000	You're off to the moments?
174000	176000	Yes.
176000	181000	I thought you'd gone south already, last winter you'd gone before the snow started.
181000	183000	Not this year I promised Moomin.
183000	184000	Promise?
184000	188000	I promised not to leave Moomin Valley until he went into hibernation.
192000	195000	Everybody seems to be here and somebody knew.
195000	196000	Who's that?
196000	198000	Have a guess.
198000	201000	Very well then, it's Alicia that's my guess.
201000	203000	How did you know?
203000	205000	What? I'm right?
205000	208000	Yes you are but I think you peaked and saw her earlier on.
208000	212000	I did it. I just named somebody I thought couldn't be here.
212000	213000	Clever huh?
213000	217000	Well she just happened to stop by. She's with Papa who's showing her around the house.
217000	219000	Is the witch here too?
219000	222000	No she didn't tell the witch she was coming here.
222000	225000	Just as well thank goodness.
227000	232000	Ah it's you snuffkin. I finally came over. I told you I would.
232000	233000	Hi.
233000	236000	Remember our friend here? He's called Sniff.
236000	238000	Hi, how do you do Sniff?
238000	243000	Well you aren't going to use your magic to cast any spells and stuff are you?
243000	245000	No.
250000	254000	Actually they didn't eat just pine needles for dinner that evening.
254000	258000	They had lots of other nice things too. All cooked by Moomin Mama.
258000	261000	Snuffkin I'd like to say how story I am.
261000	262000	Why?
262000	266000	I persuaded you to stay on here instead of going south as you'd planned.
266000	268000	I'm leaving tomorrow.
268000	270000	But the snow is quite deep.
270000	272000	Don't worry I'm used to deep snow.
272000	276000	I'm just worried Alicia will find it hard to get home in this.
276000	281000	Well she could spell the night here but of course tomorrow will be asleep for the winter so...
284000	286000	Huh?
286000	288000	Hmm? Someones is a door.
288000	290000	I'll see who it is.
291000	298000	Oh hello. How are you?
298000	304000	Hello indeed my young man. My granddaughter is here isn't she?
304000	307000	Who is it then Moomin?
307000	309000	Oh my dear.
309000	312000	You must be Moomin Papa.
315000	317000	Now you listen to me Moomin Papa.
317000	321000	I don't want my granddaughter playing with your children under any circumstances.
321000	323000	Do I make myself quite clear?
323000	325000	But Alicia likes playing with us.
325000	326000	Grandma!
326000	329000	We're leaving. Can't I stand a little longer?
329000	332000	Hello you're most welcome to stay and have dinner with us.
332000	336000	Don't you know I'm a witch? I can't eat that sort of baby food.
336000	338000	Alicia quite likes the food.
338000	342000	The pine needles look okay. The rest is yucky. Come Alicia.
342000	344000	Please let me stay grandma.
344000	348000	Not young lady. I've told you before which is never mixed with people like this.
348000	350000	And that goes for novice which is as well.
350000	351000	Never.
351000	353000	With their knives they're really all grandma.
353000	355000	And I told you that's the trouble.
355000	359000	They are disgustingly sicknessly good.
359000	362000	You will hear a lot more about this when we get home.
362000	364000	Come on now.
364000	369000	It's really cold out here and there's a lot more snow on the way.
369000	371000	All right I'm coming grandma.
371000	372000	Coming.
372000	374000	Oh thank you.
374000	375000	Mum and Papa.
375000	376000	Yeah?
376000	378000	We understand each other now don't we?
378000	380000	I'm sure you understand me.
380000	382000	Never mind about that.
382000	385000	You and your whole family are never to speak to my granddaughter again.
385000	387000	Is that understood?
387000	389000	But grandma.
389000	392000	Mind what I say over a vengeance of touch will come upon you.
392000	394000	Or even the revenge of a serious.
394000	397000	If you think cheap threats like that impress Mum and Papa.
397000	399000	You're making a grave mistake.
399000	402000	And Papa is a highly educated gentleman.
402000	404000	But I am a witch with three diplomas.
404000	405000	Maybe so.
405000	410000	But tell me how can three diplomas help you to get home with all this snow.
410000	413000	Ha! Child's play to an accredited witch.
413000	416000	Come, Alicia.
416000	420000	I've ever seen one of these before, a little pep square.
420000	423000	Is that really a witch's broom?
423000	424000	Well, never.
424000	426000	Let's go and see.
426000	430000	Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
430000	431000	I'm ready.
431000	432000	Hold on, Ditalisia.
432000	433000	Okay.
433000	435000	Can you both ride on that broom?
435000	437000	It looks pretty scrappy to me.
437000	439000	Could fall to pieces any minute.
439000	442000	Do drive slowly in this weather.
442000	444000	Oh, please don't fall off, Alicia.
444000	447000	But terrible chatterboxes you all are.
447000	450000	Please keep quiet out of you.
450000	451000	Are you ready, girl?
451000	452000	Yeah?
452000	454000	Bet they'll never be able to take off.
454000	455000	Huh?
455000	456000	Huh?
456000	457000	Oh...
478000	480000	What is it, Grandma?
480000	481000	Nothing.
481000	482000	Oh!
482000	483000	Oh!
483000	484000	Oh!
484000	485000	Oh!
485000	487000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
487000	489000	Just what I thought, they're too heavy.
489000	493000	Listen, I could take Alicia's place, I'm not too heavy.
493000	496000	Don't worry, I'm happy to walk home, Grandma.
496000	498000	Don't be so ridiculous, child.
498000	500000	You can't walk home in all this snow.
500000	501000	You'll never make it.
501000	502000	Only I had some skis.
502000	504000	Come on, climb aboard.
504000	506000	I'll try another spell.
506000	509000	Grandma, are you worried because all those people are watching you?
509000	510000	Shut up!
510000	512000	I help you say the magic spell.
512000	513000	Oh!
513000	514000	Oh!
514000	515000	Oh!
515000	516000	Oh!
516000	517000	Oh!
517000	518000	Oh!
518000	519000	Oh!
519000	520000	Oh!
520000	521000	Oh!
521000	522000	Oh!
522000	523000	Oh!
523000	524000	Oh!
524000	525000	Oh!
525000	526000	They're doing it!
526000	527000	They're doing it!
527000	528000	Oh!
528000	529000	Oh!
529000	530000	Oh!
530000	531000	What?
531000	532000	Oh!
532000	533000	Oh!
533000	534000	Oh!
534000	535000	Oh!
535000	536000	Oh!
536000	537000	Oh!
538000	539000	Oh!
539000	540000	Oh!
540000	541000	Oh!
541000	542000	Oh!
542000	544000	Where'd we go?
544000	545000	Oh!
545000	546000	Oh!
546000	547000	Oh!
547000	548000	Oh!
548000	549000	Oh!
549000	550000	Oh!
550000	551000	Oh!
551000	552000	Oh!
552000	553000	Oh!
553000	554000	Oh!
554000	555000	Oh!
555000	556000	Oh!
556000	557000	Oh!
557000	558000	Oh!
558000	559000	Oh!
559000	560000	Oh!
560000	561000	Oh!
561000	562000	Oh!
562000	563000	Oh!
563000	564000	Oh!
564000	566000	She may have three diplomas, but I don't think she's very good, Mom.
567000	570000	I wish they'd sing to the ground so I could fly that broom.
570000	573000	Guess they're all right now, Mum and Papa.
573000	574000	Let's go back to our dinner.
583000	584000	Oh!
584000	587000	I forgot to thank them for asking me to stand at dinner!
587000	588000	Thank them indeed!
588000	591000	I don't think you're cut out to be a witch!
591000	593000	Oh, but Grandma, I don't want to be one!
593000	597000	Well, I'm quite happy to help, but the path will certainly be a difficult one.
597000	598000	Oh!
598000	599000	Oh!
599000	600000	Oh!
600000	601000	Oh!
601000	602000	Oh!
623000	643000	With Alessia and the witch gone home to the Valley of the Witches, Snuffkin departed for his trip south, and the Moomins went into hibernation.
654000	663000	They certainly would have slept till the beginning of the spring as usual, but this year.
671000	674000	Quite unexpectedly, something happened.
683000	685000	Oh!
714000	715000	Oh!
723000	725000	Spring here already?
730000	732000	There's someone at the window!
733000	734000	Oh!
741000	743000	It's frozen shut!
752000	753000	Hey!
753000	755000	Why did you wake me up?
755000	757000	Well, you shouldn't be asleep!
757000	759000	Didn't you know Christmas is coming?
759000	762000	It's tomorrow, so there's not a minute to be lost!
762000	764000	Christmas is coming tomorrow?
764000	766000	But who on earth is that?
766000	767000	Why?
767000	768000	Who is Christmas?
768000	770000	This isn't a joke moment!
770000	772000	I'm not in the least ready!
772000	776000	I've lost my mittens and Christmas is coming and I haven't got a fertry yet!
776000	779000	A fertry, I really must get a fertry!
782000	784000	How very odd!
784000	786000	Why a fertry?
786000	787000	Hey!
788000	789000	Why?
789000	791000	Oh, what's that, Moomins?
794000	798000	Well, Christmas is almost coming and we don't have a fertry yet!
798000	799000	Christmas?
799000	800000	Hmm.
800000	802000	Did you say Christmas is coming?
802000	805000	Yes, and before that, one must have a fertry!
805000	807000	What's this about a fertry?
807000	811000	Well, you need one to protect ourselves against this Christmas person, Moomins Mama.
811000	813000	I am not really quite clear on that point.
813000	818000	But there's something awful that has to be kept away, right?
818000	821000	I better go get a fertry!
835000	836000	Ha!
836000	838000	About time you Moomins got up?
838000	840000	How are you going to see?
840000	842000	Pretty good fertry, Dad!
844000	847000	Well, thank you, Gavsie, but could you tell me something?
847000	849000	What is one supposed to do with it?
849000	852000	Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
852000	854000	Oh, really, Moomins Papa!
854000	857000	The way you can joke with such a straight face!
857000	858000	Joke?
858000	859000	Eh?
859000	862000	Love to stay, but I haven't even finished cooking yet!
865000	867000	I wasn't joking.
867000	869000	No one believed me either!
874000	876000	Would you like a little more, young man?
876000	880000	No, thank you very much. I'm really nice and warm again now.
880000	883000	I saw Moomins Papa and Moomins bring up a big tree!
883000	885000	But what is one supposed to do with it?
885000	887000	Don't you know?
887000	888000	No!
888000	891000	Why are you decorated as beautifully as you can?
891000	892000	Really?
897000	899000	Christmas is coming, so I better be off!
899000	901000	Everyone's talking of Christmas!
901000	903000	By now, I've got a long way to go!
906000	908000	Take care, dear!
914000	915000	Hello!
915000	916000	Hello!
919000	921000	Bye-bye!
921000	922000	Bye-bye!
922000	924000	Good-bye!
925000	927000	Who was that?
927000	928000	I don't know!
928000	930000	He was in a hurry to get somewhere before Christmas!
930000	932000	So I gave him some tea!
932000	933000	That was nice!
933000	936000	And he told us what to do with the fir tree!
936000	937000	What did he say?
937000	939000	To decorate it beautifully!
939000	942000	Decorate it, but why should we do that, Mama?
942000	946000	I guess we must decorate the tree to make sure we keep Christmas happy!
946000	947000	Yes, you're right!
947000	949000	We'd better start doing it right away!
949000	952000	Yes, I'm sure there's another moment to lose!
952000	953000	No!
953000	954000	Mama!
954000	955000	Yes, dear!
955000	958000	They also say we have to cook lots of food for Christmas!
958000	959000	Goodness!
959000	962000	Well, at least he won't be eating us then!
971000	972000	Here!
972000	974000	Thank you, Snorkmaid!
974000	975000	Oh!
975000	977000	The ship means rather a lot to me!
977000	980000	It will look fantastic on the tree, Papa!
980000	982000	Yes, dear, I suppose you're right!
983000	984000	Oh!
984000	987000	Why don't we put this at the top?
987000	989000	This is Mama's!
989000	991000	Don't worry!
991000	994000	Mmm, that looks beautiful!
994000	997000	Listen, everybody!
997000	1002000	I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas, too!
1002000	1004000	Really, Mama?
1004000	1006000	Yes, I do!
1007000	1011000	I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas, too!
1011000	1013000	Really, Mama?
1013000	1016000	I don't wonder what this Christmas will be like!
1016000	1019000	What if it's an awful greedy, beastly monster like the grove?
1019000	1021000	Don't worry, Snorkmaid!
1021000	1024000	We'll give him lots of presents and stuff him full of food!
1028000	1031000	Have you thought of any presents for Christmas yet?
1031000	1033000	I don't know what to give him!
1033000	1035000	Look, a seashell!
1036000	1038000	Oh, that's a beauty!
1041000	1044000	Oh, look, Mama, what I got for Christmas!
1044000	1047000	I'm going to give him a pretty lure for fishing!
1047000	1049000	I'm giving him this book!
1049000	1050000	Great presents!
1050000	1055000	I'm sure he'll be very happy with the moment family and not Thomas at all!
1056000	1058000	I think Christmas will come any moment now!
1058000	1060000	So do I!
1060000	1061000	Oh, dear!
1061000	1064000	I do hope he likes my pumpkin pie!
1064000	1065000	He will!
1065000	1068000	Imagine everyone in Moomin Valley being frightened!
1068000	1069000	Mmm!
1086000	1087000	Mmm!
1087000	1089000	Are you sleepy?
1089000	1090000	Yes, I am!
1090000	1093000	I can't stay this scared for much longer!
1093000	1096000	Better come before all the food freezes!
1097000	1098000	Oh!
1100000	1102000	He's coming!
1105000	1108000	I never thought Christmas could be that small!
1109000	1111000	Merry Christmas!
1111000	1113000	Merry Christmas! Is that what he is?
1113000	1115000	Well, it's just what you say!
1115000	1119000	All of my life I have dreamed of seeing all this up close, honestly!
1120000	1123000	I never really thought a Christmas tree could be this beautiful!
1123000	1125000	Brought my friends, too!
1125000	1127000	You're all very welcome!
1127000	1129000	Oh, thank you!
1129000	1130000	Hear that, everybody?
1130000	1132000	We're all very welcome!
1132000	1133000	Woo!
1133000	1134000	Man, let's get him!
1134000	1136000	There's some wonderful things here!
1136000	1137000	Yeah!
1139000	1141000	Oh, what a lot of food you've made!
1141000	1144000	Yes, all the food there is for Christmas!
1144000	1146000	And are those real presents?
1147000	1148000	Yeah!
1148000	1152000	All of my life, I've sort of wondered about those things called presents!
1152000	1155000	Papa, I don't think these creatures are Christmas!
1155000	1157000	Neither do I!
1165000	1167000	You look sleepy!
1167000	1169000	I am!
1169000	1171000	Must be well past midnight!
1172000	1174000	What is Christmas doing, Mama?
1174000	1177000	Aren't you sleepy, too, little ones?
1177000	1180000	Sleepy with a wonderful Christmas tree like this to look at!
1183000	1185000	Hey, Papa!
1185000	1186000	What is it?
1186000	1188000	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
1188000	1190000	Hmm, maybe.
1192000	1195000	Nobody can get really angry this late at night, surely!
1195000	1198000	We'll close the doors and perhaps we'll be safe inside!
1198000	1200000	I'm sure you're right!
1200000	1205000	Listen, my friends, we'd like to give you the tree and the food and the presents!
1205000	1206000	What?
1206000	1207000	All of this?
1207000	1208000	For us?
1209000	1210000	Yes, we want to sleep!
1210000	1212000	We're far more sleepy than scared!
1216000	1217000	Snort, Ma'am?
1217000	1219000	Oh, I see here yet!
1219000	1222000	No, but we decided to go back to hibernating!
1226000	1228000	Bye-bye!
1241000	1244000	I thought Christmas tree should have a star on top!
1244000	1247000	I don't think it makes any difference, you know?
1247000	1250000	A nice rose is just as good as a star!
1250000	1252000	Look at that!
1256000	1260000	And apparently it didn't make any difference at all!
1260000	1264000	Because the moon and family slept as peacefully as ever!
1264000	1267000	All through the night, without Christmas!
1267000	1268000	Coming!
1268000	1269000	Anywhere!
1272000	1273000	Hi!
1274000	1277000	And apparently it didn't make any difference at all!
1277000	1280000	Because the moon and family slept as peacefully as ever!
1280000	1283000	All through the night, without Christmas!
1283000	1286000	Coming anywhere near them!
1286000	1289000	So probably, he went someplace else!
1292000	1298000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements!
1298000	1306000	You're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements!
1306000	1310000	They're always happy and always at play!
1310000	1314000	The movements are having fun day after day!
1314000	1317000	The movements!
1317000	1321000	The movements!
1321000	1327000	The movements!
