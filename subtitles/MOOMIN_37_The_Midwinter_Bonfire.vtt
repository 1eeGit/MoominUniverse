04:33.040 --> 04:40.880
airy light yes spring hasn't arrived yet has it not yet everybody else is still asleep then yes

04:40.880 --> 04:46.640
most of them anyway wonder if my brother's still up well he did say before we started

04:46.640 --> 04:52.080
hibernating he wanted to finish his blueprints before spring if he could I hope you'll succeed

04:52.080 --> 05:00.400
this time when you go out outside just to see what the snow looks like oh no I don't really feel

05:00.400 --> 05:07.600
like it it's nice and warm here why don't we sleep does spring like the others spring is still a

05:07.840 --> 05:14.400
long way off guess you're right it is nice and warm in here

05:14.400 --> 05:20.400
oh

05:29.200 --> 05:38.000
damn it's delicious chocolate cakes my favorite yes I did you say something snorkemen

05:38.160 --> 05:50.800
I'm so very hungry movement your mother's raspberry juice is really the best it is isn't it

05:50.800 --> 05:57.040
everybody said that last winter too he moment yeah I have a funny feeling someone is watching us

05:57.040 --> 06:02.960
and I don't like it one little bit moment poppacate explain it I'm sure of course someone's watching

06:03.040 --> 06:08.640
what but who and how do you know to take you told me all about it last winter snort maiden she

06:08.640 --> 06:14.000
doesn't hibernate you know she lives in our bathhouse and watches over us in the winter she said

06:14.000 --> 06:20.880
that many things are too shy to show themselves oh have you seen them yourself short of except they

06:20.880 --> 06:29.040
were invisible of course like under the sink or in the clock maybe in the empty fireplace and other

06:29.120 --> 06:35.760
dark corners of the room I can feel it did you actually look anywhere for them oh no they'd be

06:35.760 --> 06:40.960
very upset it's better not to let them know we know where they are I wonder what these things look

06:40.960 --> 06:46.160
like some of them look very much like us two tiki said old ancestors of ours from way back she

06:46.160 --> 06:52.160
thinks some of them look like as she said well I've never seen them for myself I wonder if there is

06:52.160 --> 07:03.600
good looking as we are wouldn't it be a good idea to stay up and wait for the sunrise a great idea

07:09.600 --> 07:15.280
now don't say anything to scare them but this is one of the movement's ancestors from way back

07:15.920 --> 07:24.880
is it morning already are you sure I think so there are no clouds so why can't we see the sun I guess

07:24.880 --> 07:30.640
maybe the sun doesn't come up at all this time of the year mom and I don't like this I don't like

07:30.640 --> 07:38.240

you wanted to ride on the brum didn't you first so look like well

08:51.920 --> 08:53.920
oh

08:53.920 --> 08:55.920
oh

08:55.920 --> 08:57.920
oh

08:57.920 --> 08:59.920
oh

09:01.920 --> 09:06.960
if you want to learn to fly on this bram Alicia then forget all about those

09:06.960 --> 09:11.600
dreaded movements and really start studying it's hard work you know young woman you

09:11.600 --> 09:13.600
let's learn concentrate

09:13.600 --> 09:21.600
hey you up there are you making fun of me too

09:21.600 --> 09:35.600
oh I can't climb down there of course you can even if you fall you can't hurt yourself on this soft snow

09:35.600 --> 09:41.520
don't shake the ladder Moomin this is scary slowly does it take it easy as

09:41.520 --> 09:45.520
you can don't look down maybe going out wasn't such a good idea after all

09:45.520 --> 09:49.520
we can always change our mind to go back to sleep you know

09:49.520 --> 09:53.520
see you've made it it's very cold out here Moomin but I'd rather like it

09:57.520 --> 10:03.520
this is the roof over the front door isn't it yes and everything will be snowed up now to spring oh no

10:03.520 --> 10:05.520
what's happened to our firewood

10:05.920 --> 10:15.840
what's the matter there's not much wood left in here someone else must be burning it

10:15.840 --> 10:23.760
yes but who and for what I wonder I can feel it we're not alone in this forest I'm sure

10:23.760 --> 10:28.720
someone's watching us all those winter creatures no I don't think it's them

10:28.720 --> 10:33.840
the grog

10:38.320 --> 10:41.680
goodness me look how big she gets in the winter time

10:41.680 --> 10:46.480
Moomin I'm scared it'll be all right

10:47.360 --> 10:49.600
grog stop right there

10:52.240 --> 10:56.720
don't come any closer if you please you're much much too cold for us you see

10:57.120 --> 11:04.800
you could freeze a stiff you know oh is it possible that you get lonely all by yourself

11:07.040 --> 11:11.920
I don't think there's anything we can do to help you know not without fur coats and earmuffs and

11:11.920 --> 11:14.480
more gloves anyway we must go

11:31.440 --> 11:35.600
someone's been stealing our firewood I wonder what they're doing with it

11:35.600 --> 11:43.280
something bad there's no doubt about that must have been several people did this

11:58.160 --> 12:03.520
we had a lot of fun here in the summer remember well the she is still here

12:03.520 --> 12:13.520
round of the ice I hope too ticky too ticky there's no one here are you sure look for yourself

12:16.800 --> 12:22.640
I know they're invisible but I'm a shrewmice in here hard to tell with things you can't see

12:23.760 --> 12:30.880
oh what is it it felt like something scampering on my back that's all right it must be one of the shrewmice

12:33.920 --> 12:49.440
oh my god my goodness I've never seen anything quite like this before hi it's good to see you

12:50.160 --> 12:56.880
you're right she's fishing hi to ticky hello to ticky so this winter's not meant to walk up to huh

12:57.520 --> 13:03.600
uh uh I walk her up by mistake you know that spring is still a long way off don't you I thought it

13:03.600 --> 13:09.520
might be seeing there's no sun at all but the sun is going to come back tomorrow woman tomorrow

13:10.160 --> 13:15.680
snorkemaiden was so worried about the sun not showing the sun will rise tomorrow woman but it'll

13:15.680 --> 13:22.720
go down very soon to ticky you know I think there must be records in moving valley records in winter

13:22.720 --> 13:29.440
there's an enormous pile of firewood up on the hillside I know it took a long time to collect that

13:29.440 --> 13:36.080
wood but some of it belongs to us that doesn't really surprise me though woman I'm afraid the

13:36.080 --> 13:41.920
winner creatures unfair careful about ownership they need a lot so if they see it they take it it's

13:41.920 --> 13:49.280
for their big winner bonfire a bonfire yes and now your firewood can take part in the big celebration

13:49.360 --> 13:55.440
they light it every winter to make sure the sun comes back you know oh you mean otherwise the sun

13:55.440 --> 14:02.160
wouldn't come back to ticky well since they always light it on this day you don't really know do you

14:02.160 --> 14:08.000
tonight you might see the winner creatures okay we come along as well to ticky yes you can if you

14:08.000 --> 14:12.960
sit quietly and don't scare them in any way wonderful you're coming along too aren't you

14:12.960 --> 14:19.520
it of course stop happy someone shouting for help who could it be

14:20.160 --> 14:26.960
go away get away from me I didn't do it on purpose I didn't mean any harm if you don't leave

14:26.960 --> 14:32.720
me alone grandma will turn you into a towed oh it's so cold go away please

14:32.720 --> 14:34.720
oh

14:40.640 --> 14:44.240
grow leave her alone what are you doing Grog

14:47.360 --> 14:54.400
movement Alicia now listen Grog why can't you be nice to her Alicia's one of my friends she was

14:54.400 --> 14:59.440
just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis I nearly bumped into her but

14:59.440 --> 15:04.960
I didn't touch her that's all right Alicia tell me Grog what's gotten into you why you so nasty

15:04.960 --> 15:11.040
to such a sweet little girl it isn't like you at all I must have startled her I guess and I did

15:11.040 --> 15:17.040
apologize and all but it made no difference this is really very odd then I asked if she had seen

15:17.040 --> 15:23.280
you and that's when she started to get mad at me but she doesn't even know me it's a mystery

15:23.360 --> 15:25.280
whatever's the matter with you Grog

15:39.920 --> 15:46.880
oh it was so scared I'm so glad you've come to see us so am I moment somehow I felt certain you

15:46.880 --> 15:52.560
hadn't gone into hibernation yet but what did your grandmother say nothing because I

15:52.560 --> 15:58.000
didn't tell her I was coming thank you for chasing off that terrible monster the Grog hasn't

15:58.000 --> 16:04.640
actually ever attacked anyone well maybe she doesn't like the look of Alicia snork maiden oh it's

16:04.640 --> 16:10.960
really a mystery to me why the Grog was here at all she was here looking for a moment no doubt was

16:10.960 --> 16:16.560
she he suddenly become very popular you don't mean

16:31.520 --> 16:38.000
what's the matter with you I think the Grog may have fallen in love with you movement what oh you

16:38.000 --> 16:44.400
can't mean that please tell me you're not serious it's out of the question it's a ridiculous idea don't

16:44.400 --> 16:46.400
be so silly

16:47.360 --> 16:53.360
oh

17:04.080 --> 17:10.480
where's all that drumming noise coming from from the invisible shroom ice how long before everybody

17:11.440 --> 17:16.960
oh they're here already movement all around us they are where I can't see them

17:17.760 --> 17:24.240
are they really invisible I can't see them either but I can feel their presence all around me

17:24.800 --> 17:30.320
but she's been studying witchcraft hasn't she I'm sure you and movement will be able to feel

17:30.320 --> 17:32.320
their presence quite soon

18:00.320 --> 18:10.320
oh

18:17.120 --> 18:23.120
I can see some of them look they're over there

18:30.320 --> 18:32.320
I see them too you guys

18:38.320 --> 18:43.360
do you think you tell me why can't we see all of them well we can never see them all

18:43.360 --> 18:48.000
I don't understand how did you know earlier on the shroom ice were playing the drums

18:48.000 --> 18:51.360
I just know because they sometimes play them in the batch house as well

18:51.360 --> 18:56.560
what a wonderful celebration isn't it lucky I came over here if I had not

18:56.560 --> 18:58.560
had missed a most memorable evening

19:13.520 --> 19:17.520
what's going on here the grog what

19:17.520 --> 19:28.960
what's she doing she must be looking for movement again I guess no I think she just wants to warm

19:28.960 --> 19:31.920
this up by the fire

19:45.920 --> 19:49.920
what's she doing

19:49.920 --> 20:02.880
oh that's the end of the midwinter bonfire pull grog she freezes everything she touches

20:02.880 --> 20:07.760
whatever she sits on even the hottest bonfire turns freezing cold in a matter of seconds

20:09.280 --> 20:12.000
well at least she's managed to save some of our wood

20:20.880 --> 20:27.120
oh hold on tight now snorke made in and be careful I can't wait to get into bed

20:27.920 --> 20:33.520
I wanted to stay up until the sun came up again but I don't know if I could keep awake till then

20:34.400 --> 20:44.560
so long till spring man room man goodbye and take care Alicia I will move in the moon will light my way back

20:49.920 --> 21:08.800
this time the movements of God too far something must be done I'll teach them a lesson they'll never forget

21:11.280 --> 21:19.120
they won't get the better at me now what does the witch mean by teach them a lesson

21:19.120 --> 21:25.120
that sounds very ominous let's hope at least that she lets them sleep till next spring

21:32.880 --> 21:39.040
they love the laughter and they love the living the movements

21:39.840 --> 21:46.240
we're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

21:47.520 --> 21:54.880
they're always happy and goes at play the moments are having fun day after day the

21:55.040 --> 22:01.360
moments the moments, the moments

22:01.360 --> 22:08.360
The Moons
