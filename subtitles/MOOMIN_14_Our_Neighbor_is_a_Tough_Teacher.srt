00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,720
here they are for one and all the moments are about to come on and sit down here with

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:32,960
me here for you on your TV they are the moments they are the moments so come with me give me your hand

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:41,840
I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there with the

4
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:57,020
moment there was the moments there was the moments there was the moments

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:41,840

15
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Ah, Mr. Hebblin, I know, woman, papa, you'd like me to do the fireworks. It looks like we're throwing a party. We'll have lots of pretty flowers. Just tell me what you want, mama, and we'll do it.

16
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,840
It's great, those kids will just love it. If they survive, women.

17
00:06:48,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Now then, children, the women are all a little bit odd, so behave properly. Yes, mother, we will. They'll be here soon. Take this in, woman. Okay.

18
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:21,840
The joke works really well. Oh, good. I must try it. Mmm, these look nice. Oh, stiff. Leave them alone, will you? Oh, all right. Just this one.

19
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,840
Huh? They're here. Come on, everybody. They'll soon be at the door. Right. Come on, children. Help me with the flowers.

20
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:42,840
Oh, dear. Fireworks now are later on. Oh, later on, I think. You're very old, finally.

21
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:59,840
Welcome to Moomin House, Mrs. Philly John. It was very kind of you to invite us, Moomin, mama. Come in, please, and make yourselves at home. Oh, thank you all very much indeed.

22
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:16,840
Welcome to Moomin Valley. Oh, all in my hair. It looks very untidy, doesn't it, mother?

23
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:30,840
It's a surprise. They should have been rose buds, but we couldn't find any at all. Oh, yes. Dear, what a mess. Mrs. Philly John, let me introduce the children. They all look different.

24
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Well, yes. Only Moomin is really ours. The others are sort of... I'm sure they'll all get on. Oh, I'm afraid my children do not play. They would much rather read or study.

25
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Oh, are you sure they've got to have some time for play? I'm sure. Well, come into the dining room anyway. You can watch the others playing.

26
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Make sure the chairs are clean. Yes, mother, we will.

27
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Won't you let them play at all? No, I will not.

28
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Come on, everybody. Wouldn't you like to have a go on our slide? No.

29
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:29,840
Hmm. You'd really enjoy it once you got going. I know you would. No, thank you. No, no, not at all. No, definitely not.

30
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:39,840
And you're really quite sure, are you? Yes. I thought so. Then we've got it all to ourselves.

31
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
Yahoo!

32
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Moomin sounds like he's having fun.

33
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Oh, and that's a little Mayan sniff. Your children seem very quiet, Mrs. Philly John.

34
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Good children are seen and not heard, my dear.

35
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,840
That was one of mine. Yippee!

36
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
And that was another.

37
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Well, it sounds like they're having fun for once. I have a biscuit, Mrs. Philly John. They have an unusual taste.

38
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,840
I'd run out of flowers, so I used them.

39
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Don't worry. Moomin will look after them.

40
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Go on, it's your turn now.

41
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Oh, my children.

42
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Stop it. It's too dangerous. You might hurt yourself.

43
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
No!

44
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,840
Oh, come on. Stop it at once.

45
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Now, don't you worry, Mrs. Philly John. I've got ointment in my bag if I hurt themselves.

46
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Thank you, dear mother.

47
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Stop children. You hear me. We're going home now. Stop it.

48
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Oh, this is great.

49
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,840
I think it's time for the glorious finale, Papa.

50
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840
I can't say I wasn't warned.

51
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Exposing them to this, Moomin Valley is no place for proper children. No place at all.

52
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840
Oh, dear, what's this?

53
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,840
Their fireworks in your honor.

54
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Fireworks.

55
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,840
I made them especially to welcome you.

56
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Goodbye. Come back soon.

57
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Yeah, welcome to power.

58
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
No, you will not.

59
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
I don't think Mrs. Philly John can join her party.

60
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,840
She's very lucky that I didn't bite her.

61
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,840
She should have had a go on the slide. I'm sure she would have loved it.

62
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840
And then she wouldn't have shouted at her children.

63
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,840
Donuts don't slide down, shoot sniff. They're too afraid of looking silly.

64
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,840
Whoa!

65
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Oh, oh.

66
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
Papa.

67
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Oh, I'm very sorry, Moomin, but don't worry, I'll fix it. It is nothing much broken.

68
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
What happened, my dear?

69
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,840
No, I thought it had been such a long time since I'd been on the slide that I'd have a go.

70
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,840
I didn't think I'd be too heavy for it. I know.

71
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,840
When we mend it, why don't we make it strong enough for me and Mama to play on as well?

72
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,840
I think she'd like that.

73
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,840
That's a good idea, Papa. But we want to use it too.

74
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,840
Well, that's a course. I just try it out. Now and again.

75
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,840
I want you to stay here while I'm out.

76
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
What if somebody asks us to play?

77
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
What do you mean?

78
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Play.

79
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,840
I hope you're not thinking of the Moomin's, are you?

80
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,840
I don't want you mixing with those noisy children ever again, do you hear me?

81
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,840
Where are you going, mother?

82
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,840
To look for another house. It was a terrible mistake coming to Moomin Valley.

83
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,840
Look, there's Mrs. Philly junk. Good afternoon.

84
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Please stay away from my children.

85
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Oh, but why? We thought they might like to come and have an adventure with us.

86
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Oh, never mind. Let's go.

87
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
I'm going to go.

88
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840
I'm going to go.

89
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840
I'm going to go.

90
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
I'm going to go.

91
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,840
I'm going to go.

92
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Hey, hang on a minute.

93
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Oh, you're Tarsam.

94
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Oh, no!

95
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,840
I like it.

96
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,840
It's too late for you now, Sniff.

97
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Oh, no, not the Humpty crocodile at the bottom of the Gorge.

98
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840
We should have brought the Philly junks with us.

99
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
But Moomin messes Philly junks.

100
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
We need to look tall, her.

101
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Have you been killed and eaten yet, Sniff?

102
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:14,840
No, I fell on top of the crocodile and knocked him out and then swam me shore.

103
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,840
Sniff, but I thought you couldn't swim.

104
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,840
On your own business.

105
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Hey, that looks like the Philly junks.

106
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Why don't they come over here?

107
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,840
I bet their mother told them not to talk to us.

108
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
See if I care you.

109
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Hey, what are you doing?

110
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Why aren't you playing with Moomin and the others?

111
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,840
I don't think they want to play with us.

112
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,840
They didn't call for us when they went past.

113
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,840
Stinky's arrived and wonder what he's doing here.

114
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,840
I bet you it's no fun stuck in that garden.

115
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,840
No, we'd rather be out here playing.

116
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Well, I know somewhere much better than Moomin's.

117
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,840
It's a great place to play.

118
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Do you?

119
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
Yes, would I lie to you?

120
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,840
It's a bit of a way off, but it'll be really exciting and lots of fun so do you want to come or not.

121

136
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:14,520
a bit frightening without the thrill where's the fun you need a bit of danger to spice it up

137
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,640
gee willikers it looks like the other side is higher than this side

138

159
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,640
but stinky was left on his own to decide whether to climb up the rope or drop into the river

160
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,520
and the filijong children had more fun than they'd ever had before but they didn't get home until
