1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,560
here they are for one and all the moments are about to come on and sit down here with

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:30,440

00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:44,640
like a bird sing that song ever there were the moments there were the

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:59,360
moments there were the moments there were the moments

6
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,360
snort maiden was in a very good mood because that day she was off to collect

7
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,920
shells of the seizure with me

8
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,120
hey look the sun's up and there's Gracie

9
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:40,480
oh rat what's the matter papa oh it's your moment what are you doing I heard you

10
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:49,520
talking to yourself just now oh you see this I'm writing a play writing a

11
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,280
play you remember the last children that was a very successful play just now I

12
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,280
was repeating a line hey look another beautiful day and there goes Gracie it's a

13
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:08,640
wonderful line of course don't you agree it could be improved I think about it

14
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,720
haha

15
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,520
look at this beautiful

16
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,400
you know just usual like stuff

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Oh! There's another big one! Can't you really find anything, moment?

18
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I'll look somewhere else. I still think this is the best place!

19
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Well, I'm going over there!

20
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,400
They're so beautiful!

21
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Oh!

22
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
What are you doing, moment?

23
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
No, that's no shell surely.

24
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
No. So why did you dig it out?

25
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Well, once you see it, you want to find out what it is.

26
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
A very odd thing, isn't it?

27
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Not very interesting.

28
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Oh no, I can see what it is.

29
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
I gave it a good wash.

30
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
I've seen one just like it in the fairy tales. It's an old clam.

31
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Yes, you remember the story called Aladdin? He rubbed the lamp and the genie appeared.

32
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,400
The genie might appear for us if we do what Aladdin did.

33
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Don't be silly, Snork Maiden.

34
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,400
But Snork Maiden, that was a fairy tale.

35
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Don't laugh! I just want to make absolutely sure.

36
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,400
To tell you the truth, I've already tried it. My hands turned green. That's all that happened to me.

37
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Maybe you didn't do it the right way. You can't even whip cream properly.

38
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:10,400
And I'm sure you have to say some magic words, such as apricot dapura, spirit, come forth, apricot dapura, try for all your words.

39
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,400
You've chosen the wrong words. You should say, come out, say some of your something.

40
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness! Keep going, Snork Maiden!

41
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Oh!

42
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,400
I am the spirit of the lamp. What is your command?

43
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,400
Goodness, did you come out of this lamp?

44
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
You got it.

45
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,400
So you really are the spirit of this lamp?

46
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Always have been.

47
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,400
But I have the book and you're not him.

48
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,400
I can prove it if you're quite sure you want me to.

49
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,400
By all means, it probably wasn't a good picture.

50
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,400
I'm the one and only spirit of the lamp.

51
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Oh, then you must have the power to make any wish come true, is that so?

52
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Are we certainly but not yours?

53
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
But I'm the one who'll dug you out.

54
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,400
That's not so important, kid. She's the one who summoned me forth from the lamp.

55
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
What are we going to do about this spirit?

56
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Why? Ask for something. Ask for something you've always wanted.

57
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Let's see. A pearl necklace.

58
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Sorry, may your wishes, my command.

59
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Hey, wait a minute.

60
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Oh, a pearl necklace is only one of the things I wanted I hadn't decided yet.

61
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Don't worry, Snork Maiden. I guess you can always send it back.

62
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,400
If I like the necklace, then it's your turn to rub the lamp.

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Then you can wish for whatever you've always wanted.

64
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Yes. But where exactly did you rub the lamp?

65
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Right here and very, very slowly.

66
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,400
All right, I'll say spirit come forth.

67
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,400
It sounds a little better than come out spirit.

68
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
One royal necklace, Miss.

69
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Thanks.

70
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
This is incredible.

71
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Right, I do think this is exactly what I wanted.

72
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Oh, thank you ever so much.

73
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,400
All in a day's wake. So pleased to oblige, Miss.

74
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Are you going back into the lamp?

75
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Yes, I am.

76
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,400
I'm so happy. Now it's my turn to let you out of here.

77
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,400
I'd like to have a wish granted too, please.

78
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Now, wait a minute.

79
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
If getting in and out is a bother, why don't you let me give you my wish right now?

80
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,400
You can't do it, young man. One at a time in the face to call.

81
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Just wanted to save time.

82
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Impossible, young say.

83
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
But why?

84
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Because I am only able to fulfill one wish a week.

85
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,400
I need my rest. It's hard work, you know.

86
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Oh, well, of course it's tiring.

87
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Perhaps I expected too much from you.

88
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Hold on. I wouldn't like you to think that I haven't got the power.

89
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,400
I can do many extraordinary things.

90
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
What kind of things?

91
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Not telling you.

92
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Listen, moment, we won't tell a soul about this lamp, all right?

93
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Of course not.

94
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:47,400
No, names don't really matter.

95
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Tulip Hydrangea, who cares?

96
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
No, that's not right somehow.

97
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Dranium Vox Glob.

98
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Oh, I'm so tired.

99
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Hmm.

100
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Praise the lad and I didn't tell them I can get out at night.

101
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
I'd have no peace at all.

102
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,400
My leisure time would be totally ruined by these two.

103
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Good thing also I can read their minds so I know what I'm up against.

104
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,400
They're up to something I know they are.

105
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,400
Oh, yes, dear me, dear me.

106
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,400
No wonder the young man is worried to death.

107
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,400
She wish I better rewrite this.

108
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Oh, Edgur Edgur, I do wish you was somebody else.

109
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
This will certainly have to be changed.

110
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
The whole page, really.

111
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,400
What's going on here?

112
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Who did this?

113
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Mum, not you surely.

114
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
What?

115
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
And some rascals have been rewriting my play.

116
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Who could that possibly be?

117
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Who indeed in the middle of the night while I was asleep.

118
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
It's very strange, isn't it, Papa?

119
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,400
It can't be you, Mum, can it?

120
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Of course not, Papa.

121
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
I am upset.

122
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Who can it be?

123
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Imagine going into your study while you were fast asleep.

124
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
It's very rude, isn't it?

125
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,400
I find it incredible that anyone could do such a thing.

126
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,400
And all the rewriting was done on those bits that I knew weren't perfectly polished.

127
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Listen, dear, I'm sure they were far too good for him to improve on.

128
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,400
No, no, you're wrong. That's the worst thing.

129
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,400
I must admit he did improve them.

130
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Then I think you should feel pleased, dear.

131
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
No, I'm not a bit pleased.

132
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,400
The dramatist should write his own plays.

133
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Looks great, Snork Maiden.

134
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
That is, if you like necklaces.

135
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Thank you, Little Mai. It was given to me as a present.

136
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Rather nice.

137
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Would you mind if I tried it on for a minute?

138
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Of course not. I'm sure you'll look gorgeous.

139
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,400
I suppose in time one could get to like necklaces.

140
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,400
I could ask for a similar one for you.

141
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Deepers, who's your rich friend?

142
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Yes, I searched the whole house, but I can't find it anywhere.

143
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Someone must have stolen it.

144
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Don't worry, Mrs. Philly-Johnk. I fully expect to arrest the thief any minute now.

145
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Good afternoon, Inspector.

146
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Hello, Snork Maiden.

147
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Please hurry, Inspector. The thief has almost certainly left Moomin Valley already.

148
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Nothing is safe in this valley anymore.

149
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Now calm down, Mrs. Philly-Johnk.

150
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Did you just say you've had something stolen, Mrs. Philly-Johnk?

151
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,400
My pearl necklace. Extraordinary beautiful pearls.

152
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,400
87 of them. Looks just like the one you're wearing, Little Mai.

153
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
You stole it.

154
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Did you?

155
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Oh, oh, no!

156
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
What are you doing?

157
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
What are you doing?

158
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Stop!

159
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

160
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Rest your heart.

161
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Prove the river she's a baby. She's innocent.

162
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Little via the ocean.

163
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,400
The smallest cruxer up in the most funny adventure.

164
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,400
This is Snork Maiden's necklace, you know.

165
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Oh, that's very funny.

166
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Is that the best explanation you can think of?

167
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,400
No one calls Little Mai a thief and gets away with it.

168
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Is it really true that this is your necklace, Snork Maiden?

169
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Of course, Inspector. It was a present. I swear it.

170
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Who gave it to you?

171
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
That's a secret between me and Moomin.

172
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
A secret?

173
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,400
That's a lie. They stole it, Inspector.

174
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,400
I've never known them to lie before, Mrs. Philly-Johnk.

175
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
You're back from a very bad background.

176
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
You should see their home.

177
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
So right!

178
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
No, I see it.

179
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Stop it, Little Mai!

180
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Bad background and you talk to them.

181
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
There you say that.

182
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
No, there's something I want to ask you.

183
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Little Mai, what are you doing?

184
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
No!

185
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
The boy has to be a pain, you know.

186
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
This is it.

187
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
I love to know who did this.

188
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,400
He's certainly got an act with words.

189
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Huh?

190
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Listen to this. This is a good example.

191
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Hey, look at the sky. The sun's up and there's Gracie.

192
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,400
That's not great. Sounds very ordinary.

193
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
That's what I wrote, Snorkin.

194
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Oh, I'm so sorry.

195
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,400
That's all right. Now listen to how he rewrote it.

196
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,400
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?

197
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,400
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

198
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon

199
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,400
who is already sick and pale with grief.

200
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
What a sunrise!

201
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,400
And note how clever this writer is to change her name from Gracie to Juliet.

202
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Gracie's worried because her parents don't approve of her love Edgar.

203
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
I had his names don't matter.

204
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Tulip, I'd rangers who cares.

205
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
But listen to this.

206
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
What's in a name?

207
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,400
That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

208
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
It's much more romantic.

209
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
I got it.

210
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
So Romeo would.

211
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Well, he not Romeo called.

212
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Oh, it's simply great.

213
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Except maybe I wouldn't have mentioned his smell.

214
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Don't you agree? He's an excellent playwright.

215
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Yes, I agree.

216
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
He sounds like a very promising playwright.

217
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
And then wordy perhaps, but really good.

218
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Very good indeed.

219
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
Write him a note asking him to carry on.

220
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
And there might not be necessary.

221
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,400
You know, all the changes were made in the middle of the night

222
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
while I was fast asleep.

223
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
And usually writers are in their beds,

224
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
none of their desks when they're asleep.

225
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Well, yes, that's the only time you're not at your desk, isn't it?

226
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
But there are people you know who walk about at night

227
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,400
without remembering about it the next morning.

228
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
Sleepwalkers, you mean?

229
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Now I come to think of it.

230
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,400
You were rather sleepy when you woke up this morning.

231
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,400
You're right, Mum and Mama, even sleepier than usual.

232
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Just so.

233
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
You mean you yourself got up at night

234
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,400
and then went and rewrote the play and you're asleep?

235
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Well, yes.

236
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,400
I have been worried about some minor things in my play.

237
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,400
So my subconsciousness, fairly rich and literary talent,

238
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
as we all know, comes to the rescue.

239
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
A moment, Papa.

240
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,400
And in my sleep, my imagination runs riot.

241
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,400
I have all sorts of good ideas that make me grab a pen

242
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,400
in the middle of the night and rush to my room

243
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
to let the real skill throw.

244
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
I got it!

245
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
I got it!

246
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
I got it!

247
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
With this I can have anything!

248
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
I can do anything!

249
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Stop!

250
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Stop!

251
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
When I say stop, you have to stop!

252
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
The inspector!

253
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,400
How can you put on the already?

254
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
And we've arrived when you want to get lost!

255
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Get lost yourself!

256
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
I don't have time for you!

257
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
The inspector's chasing me!

258
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
What?

259
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
You?

260
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Stop, little boy!

261
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
I'm the inspector!

262
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
You have to stop when I say so!

263
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
He's not chasing me, huh?

264
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Don't deny it!

265
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
I know why you're running!

266
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
You stole that thing, didn't you?

267
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
I know it, too!

268
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
That's gonna be your business!

269
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
It's not yours!

270
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
But it must be somebody!

271
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
So I'm making my business in it to me!

272
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Oh, is that me?

273
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Please!

274
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Stop loosening everything!

275
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Give it back to me!

276
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Hey, that looks like the lamp we found!

277
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Chase him!

278
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
It's better not be!

279
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Hello!

280
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Oh, man!

281
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
Stinky's got our magic lamp!

282
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Let after him!

283
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Yes!

284
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
We can't let him get away with it!

285
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
Or terrible!

286
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Please let it happen!

287
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Did you hear that?

288
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
That's enough here, no!

289
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
He said magic lamp or something!

290
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
After him!

291
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
The magic lamp is mine!

292
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Just leave me alone!

293
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
Where are you going, Stinky?

294
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,400
Help me get the necklace!

295
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
No, no, no, no!

296
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
This way!

297
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
He's got me!

298
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Oh!

299
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
Get him!

300
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Get him!

301
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
He's got me!

302
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Oh, man!

303
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Get him!

304
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Get him, man!

305
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Give him!

306
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Oh!

307
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Oh, my dear!

308
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
He's coming!

309
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
He's coming!

310
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Oh!

311
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
You're the spirit of the lamp, aren't you?

312
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Yes, my master.

313
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
What is your wish?

314
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
You his master?

315
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Yes, me!

316
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
I'm the master.

317
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
I let him out, so he'll do what I say.

318
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
I don't believe a word of this.

319
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Fairy tales aren't true.

320
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Maybe it isn't true, but it works.

321
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,400
I saw Snorkmaiden wishing for a pearl necklace

322
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
and her wish was granted.

323
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Uh-huh.

324
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
So you're responsible.

325
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Yeah, and I brought it right away.

326
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
God, now let me see.

327
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,400
What do I want more than anything in the world?

328
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Stinky, he can only make one wish a week come true.

329
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
You'll have to wait your turn.

330
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
No, that's very unfair.

331
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Let's get back to the necklace.

332
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Where did you steal it from, mister?

333
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
I don't steal.

334
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Well, then tell me where you found it.

335
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Around here somewhere.

336
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Mrs. Philly John's house, baby.

337
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
I don't know who lives there.

338
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Oh, then you did steal the necklace.

339
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,400
Well, that's a lot easier, you know.

340
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
How about a magic key that can open anything,

341
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
bolts and safes and stuff, huh?

342
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,400
Listen, there's something I'd like to ask you.

343
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
A sack of gold wouldn't be half as much fun

344
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
as a key that opens anything.

345
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Tell me, is it possible that you rewrote women poppers play?

346
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Yes, I did. It was really awful.

347
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Oh, come on, now I just needed some polishing.

348
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,400
And what's more, see this young man standing here?

349
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Well, he was really worried about your play, you know?

350
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
I was just trying to help.

351
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Is this true?

352
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Yeah, safer than mercury, of course.

353
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,400
But then there's professional pride to think of.

354
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
I can explain, Papa.

355
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
I saw you weren't happy about your play

356
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
and I wanted it to be a big success.

357
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Of course, I didn't want the spirit to write it himself.

358
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,400
I'm going to take the key, yeah!

359
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
I've just realized, everybody,

360
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
the spirit didn't write all that himself.

361
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
I've heard it before.

362
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
I thought it sounded familiar.

363
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
Is that so?

364
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Yes, he stole it from a play by somebody else.

365
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,400
This spirit is a cheat and a liar.

366
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Oh, dear me.

367
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Well, I can't help being so well read.

368
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Can I go back in the lamp now?

369
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
No! Wait! Don't go yet!

370
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
I want next week's list now!

371
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Sorry, Mastic Interblind.

372
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Have them put into an impossible situation.

373
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
See you next week!

374
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
But that's ridiculous!

375
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Not next week, nor next month, or even next year.

376
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Stinky, this lamp is not yours.

377
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Besides, I know exactly the sort of thing you'd ask for.

378
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
A master key or something.

379
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,400
You think you can hide that magic lamp from me, do you?

380
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Well, there's no hiding place good enough for that.

381
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Hmm.

382
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Well, then I really do think that lamp is a bit too dangerous to have a rod.

383
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Hmm. I think you're right.

384
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Snuff candy, you have any good ideas for us?

385
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Yes, for us.

386
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Hmm. The week has passed, so we can summon the spirit again.

387
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
There's the inspector!

388
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,400
You do it, Snuffkin!

389
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Call the spirit!

390
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Oh, no, not again. What do you want this time?

391
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Can you bring the hobgoblin here?

392
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,400
I suppose so. I'll be back as soon as I can.

393
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,400
But why on earth do you want the hobgoblin?

394
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,400
As far as I can see, there's only one safe place for the lamp where no one can find it.

395
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,400
And that's on another planet, and the only one who can put it there is the hobgoblin.

396
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
He's coming any minute.

397
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Geez, that guy ever hard to find.

398
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Thank you. I've done my wake for this week.

399
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,400
See you next week. Goodbye!

400
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:23,400
And some of the hobgoblin took the magic ramp away and hid it on some unknown planet.

401
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:30,400
And a good thing too, it would really be very boring if all your wishes were granted, wouldn't it?

402
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:40,400
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

403
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:47,400
We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

404
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,400
They're always happy and goes at play.

405
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:58,400
The Moons are having fun day after day. The Moons.

406
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,400
The Moons.

407
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,400
The Moons.
