519260,523260,"and we never had to hunt for our food. All our meals are brought to us, you see.",519200,519900,"SPEAKER_03"
523260,526260,"But your tigers, what do you eat them?",519200,519900,"SPEAKER_03"
526260,529260,"Well, we love cat food.",526000,526900,"SPEAKER_04"

531260,533260,"Oh, I don't believe it.",530800,531000,"SPEAKER_03"
533260,537260,"Yes, it's easy to chew and it leaves our fur all sleek and shiny.",531800,533400,"SPEAKER_04"
537260,540260,"We like the yellow tins with the black cat. Don't we, honey?",534200,534400,"SPEAKER_00"
540260,544260,"Yes, it's our favorite. You wouldn't happen to have any on you, would you?",534200,534400,"SPEAKER_00"
550260,552260,"Oh.",540700,544300,"SPEAKER_21"

608260,612260,"Um, I don't think that's a good place to hide, Mrs. Snake.",601000,601600,"SPEAKER_13"
613260,616260,"I'm afraid that doesn't look quite right, Tiger.",601000,601600,"SPEAKER_13"
616260,619260,"I thought I might just look like a thick rug.",615800,619300,"SPEAKER_10"
619260,622260,"I'll just lie here like a beautiful porcelain ornament.",615800,619300,"SPEAKER_10"
622260,625260,"They'll never know we're here, darling.",622000,623900,"SPEAKER_10"
625260,630260,"Well, they'd never expect to find a Rhino under there.",624400,626800,"SPEAKER_04"
631260,633260,"That's what I thought. Where are they?",630400,632300,"SPEAKER_04"
633260,636260,"They can't just have vanished into thin air.",630400,632300,"SPEAKER_04"

714260,717260,"Oh, are you on some sort of expedition?",714200,727000,"SPEAKER_02"
717260,720260,"Excuse me, but are you the owner of this house?",714200,727000,"SPEAKER_02"
720260,724260,"Yes, indeed I am. I'm movement papa. What can I do for you?",714200,727000,"SPEAKER_02"
724260,727260,"Why don't you consent out the animals hiding in your house?",714200,727000,"SPEAKER_02"

729260,730260,"Animals?",727000,728800,"SPEAKER_03"
730260,734260,"Oh, no. We have firm believers that they belong out there.",729700,733900,"SPEAKER_03"
734260,739260,"Sir, you can't see from where you are, but I can assure you that there is a python sticking its head out of your chimney.",734000,744600,"SPEAKER_03"

741260,743260,"Yes, that's right.",734000,744600,"SPEAKER_03"
743260,745260,"No, it isn't.",734000,744600,"SPEAKER_03"
745260,747260,"It isn't.",745200,746300,"SPEAKER_02"
747260,750260,"No, it's my daughter. She happens to look like a python.",746900,746900,"SPEAKER_03"
747260,750260,"No, it's my daughter. She happens to look like a python.",746900,747600,"SPEAKER_02"
750260,752260,"Not all the time you understand.",750100,750500,"SPEAKER_03"

762260,766260,"It's up to you, sir. There are no animals, and you won't enter my house.",761800,774900,"SPEAKER_03"
766260,771260,"Now, wait a minute. I do believe, yes. You're one of those hippos, aren't you?",761800,774900,"SPEAKER_03"
771260,775260,"I am not. I'm movement papa, and I am the owner of this house.",761800,774900,"SPEAKER_03"
775260,778260,"No, you're not. You're a hippopotamus. How dare you?",761800,774900,"SPEAKER_03"
778260,782260,"A hippo who owns a house, and it's also running an illegal zoo.",776000,790500,"SPEAKER_03"
782260,784260,"Break down the doors.",776000,790500,"SPEAKER_03"
784260,787260,"That is against the law.",776000,790500,"SPEAKER_03"
787260,792260,"Oh, it is, isn't? Well, there's a nice cage winning for you as well, movement papa, hippo.",776000,790500,"SPEAKER_03"
792260,796260,"I warn you, if you touch that door, you'll regret it.",791100,796300,"SPEAKER_03"
792260,796260,"I warn you, if you touch that door, you'll regret it.",791100,791100,"SPEAKER_13"
792260,796260,"I warn you, if you touch that door, you'll regret it.",791100,791700,"SPEAKER_02"
796260,799260,"No, yeah.",791100,796300,"SPEAKER_03"

796260,799260,"No, yeah.",791100,791700,"SPEAKER_02"
799260,802260,"Great boys, let's go in.",796300,799500,"SPEAKER_02"
802260,805260,"Charge!",800100,800500,"SPEAKER_03"
806260,808260,"Ah!",806100,806200,"SPEAKER_03"
828260,831260,"Now then, what's going on?",827200,828000,"SPEAKER_13"
831260,833260,"Little Mike brought the inspector.",831200,835400,"SPEAKER_10"
833260,836260,"Oh, right. What do you mean that you're doing?",831200,835400,"SPEAKER_10"
836260,839260,"Ah, they're hiding animals from the zoo in this house. We want them back.",831200,835400,"SPEAKER_10"
839260,842260,"I tried to reason with the hippo, but it was no good.",836400,853900,"SPEAKER_03"
842260,846260,"Oh, have you know that's willful destruction of property, my good man?",836400,853900,"SPEAKER_03"
846260,849260,"It's not willful. We're from the zoo. We got to get in somehow.",836400,853900,"SPEAKER_03"
849260,854260,"Oh, have you, and can you be sure that there are zoo animals in there?",836400,853900,"SPEAKER_03"
854260,860260,"You just take a look up there at the chimney. That's all I'm sure. Go on.",836400,853900,"SPEAKER_03"
861260,863260,"See that python's head sticking out?",861200,862900,"SPEAKER_03"
864260,865260,"That's odd.",861200,862900,"SPEAKER_03"
865260,867260,"I can't see a python's head.",864500,870000,"SPEAKER_03"
867260,870260,"But there was a python's head up there, I saw it.",864500,870000,"SPEAKER_03"
870260,873260,"Ugh, I can't breathe.",864500,870000,"SPEAKER_03"
874260,877260,"Now you listen to me, zoo man.",874200,885500,"SPEAKER_03"
877260,880260,"Either you stop bothering my friends or I'll arrest you.",874200,885500,"SPEAKER_03"
880260,882260,"Is that clear? Well, is it?",874200,885500,"SPEAKER_03"
882260,885260,"Yes, sir, it is. But what about the zoo animals?",874200,885500,"SPEAKER_03"
885260,888260,"You heard the inspector now go away.",874200,885500,"SPEAKER_03"
888260,889260,"Do you see that?",886100,899200,"SPEAKER_03"
889260,890260,"See what?",886100,899200,"SPEAKER_03"
890260,891260,"The hippopotamus.",886100,899200,"SPEAKER_03"
891260,892260,"What?",886100,899200,"SPEAKER_03"
892260,895260,"The hippopotamus. He's the fellows from hiding all our zoo animals.",886100,899200,"SPEAKER_03"
895260,897260,"We got a nice cage lined up for him as well, inspector.",886100,899200,"SPEAKER_03"
897260,899260,"Oh, so that's your plan, is it?",886100,899200,"SPEAKER_03"
899260,901260,"Ha, they want to take them all.",886100,899200,"SPEAKER_03"
901260,904260,"Moomin, snork, me, mama, and papa.",899600,903800,"SPEAKER_11"
904260,906260,"Hmm, the criminal conspiracy.",899600,903800,"SPEAKER_11"
906260,907260,"Conspiracy?",904500,909600,"SPEAKER_03"
907260,909260,"It would probably be called kidnapping.",904500,909600,"SPEAKER_03"
909260,911260,"Once you can't kidnap a hippo.",904500,909600,"SPEAKER_03"
911260,913260,"That's a movement.",909700,913200,"SPEAKER_03"
913260,915260,"It could be white slavery, though.",909700,913200,"SPEAKER_03"
915260,918260,"I'm sure I could add incitement to riot to the list.",913700,924000,"SPEAKER_03"
918260,921260,"Now, I hate paperwork, so I'll tell you one.",913700,924000,"SPEAKER_03"
921260,923260,"If you're gone within 10 minutes, I won't arrest you.",913700,924000,"SPEAKER_03"
923260,926260,"Why don't you put them in the deepest dungeon, inspector?",913700,924000,"SPEAKER_03"
926260,928260,"The one with all the rats and spiders and scorpions",924000,931200,"SPEAKER_11"
928260,930260,"that'll teach them to put Moomin's encages.",924000,931200,"SPEAKER_11"
930260,934260,"That's a good idea, little mind. They like animals.",924000,931200,"SPEAKER_11"
934260,937260,"I'll start counting now.",931200,934000,"SPEAKER_03"
937260,940260,"One, two, three.",935400,936800,"SPEAKER_03"
940260,942260,"Get around men quickly.",939000,939600,"SPEAKER_03"
942260,944260,"All right.",941100,942300,"SPEAKER_03"
944260,946260,"We'll have to think quickly on this one, man.",941100,942300,"SPEAKER_03"
946260,948260,"Come on, now. Does anybody have any smart ideas?",944500,948600,"SPEAKER_03"
948260,952260,"Come on. We're running out of time.",944500,948600,"SPEAKER_03"
952260,953260,"One minute.",948800,950500,"SPEAKER_03"
953260,955260,"Look, guys, we're going to figure something out right now.",952700,958000,"SPEAKER_03"
955260,956260,"Ready and look.",952700,958000,"SPEAKER_03"
956260,959260,"One minute, thirty seconds.",952700,958000,"SPEAKER_03"
959260,962260,"Two minutes. Three minutes, thirty seconds.",956400,956600,"SPEAKER_20"
962260,963260,"Look.",961100,962500,"SPEAKER_03"
963260,965260,"Leave us alone, way we're conferring.",963000,967900,"SPEAKER_03"
965260,968260,"All right. Six minutes and fifty seconds.",963000,967900,"SPEAKER_03"
968260,969260,"Time's up.",963000,967900,"SPEAKER_03"
969260,970260,"You're cheating.",969200,972800,"SPEAKER_03"
970260,973260,"The police don't cheat, and now you've got...",969200,972800,"SPEAKER_03"
973260,975260,"nine minutes and thirty seconds.",969200,972800,"SPEAKER_03"
975260,977260,"How about that?",973500,983500,"SPEAKER_03"
977260,979260,"Nine minutes, fifty bucks, I give up.",973500,983500,"SPEAKER_03"
979260,980260,"Everybody beat it.",973500,983500,"SPEAKER_03"
980260,982260,"But we're still discussing it.",973500,983500,"SPEAKER_03"
982260,984260,"No, we're not. We're getting out.",973500,983500,"SPEAKER_03"
984260,988260,"Look, everyone, the zoom in, they're running off.",984200,986500,"SPEAKER_02"
988260,989260,"Great.",984200,986500,"SPEAKER_02"
989260,991260,"You've got to come and see this, Mama.",988300,988900,"SPEAKER_10"
991260,994260,"Nine minutes and fifty and a half seconds.",989300,991200,"SPEAKER_10"
994260,997260,"And don't come back. We'll be the dungeon for you.",991600,999500,"SPEAKER_03"
997260,999260,"And I make that ten minutes up to you.",991600,999500,"SPEAKER_03"
999260,1001260,"You saved his little life.",991600,999500,"SPEAKER_03"
1001260,1003260,"It was really clever of you to fetch the inspector.",999500,1002000,"SPEAKER_10"
1003260,1006260,"Well, there were too many of them for me to fight.",1002000,1009000,"SPEAKER_11"
1006260,1009260,"Okay? Everyone, come on now.",1002000,1009000,"SPEAKER_11"
1015260,1017260,"And so everyone was saved.",1002000,1009000,"SPEAKER_11"
1017260,1019260,"And eventually, they all came out of the house",1015400,1021300,"SPEAKER_17"
1019260,1021260,"to go and have fun in the jungle again.",1015400,1021300,"SPEAKER_17"
1021260,1023260,"As long as the warm weather lasted,",1015400,1021300,"SPEAKER_17"
1023260,1025260,"there were plenty of things to do.",1021600,1025300,"SPEAKER_17"
1025260,1027260,"But one day, the weather changed.",1021600,1025300,"SPEAKER_17"
1027260,1030260,"And cold winds blew down Moomin Valley.",1025400,1029800,"SPEAKER_17"
1031260,1034260,"Oh, it feels like autumn has arrived.",1025400,1029800,"SPEAKER_17"
1034260,1037260,"The jungle won't like the cold weather.",1031900,1034600,"SPEAKER_19"
1037260,1039260,"Do you think it will die, Mama?",1035400,1039500,"SPEAKER_11"
1039260,1041260,"I'm afraid it will, little my.",1035400,1039500,"SPEAKER_11"
1041260,1046260,"It grew very quickly, so perhaps it will go the same way.",1040200,1045800,"SPEAKER_19"
1046260,1048260,"And it did.",1040200,1045800,"SPEAKER_19"
1048260,1052260,"The whole jungle withered and died in just one night.",1047500,1052300,"SPEAKER_17"
1058260,1060260,"I think I've done a cold coming, Mama.",1047500,1052300,"SPEAKER_17"
1060260,1063260,"I'm sorry, I can't get the house any hotter.",1058400,1060300,"SPEAKER_20"
1063260,1065260,"I missed the zoo, at least it was warm now.",1062900,1065400,"SPEAKER_20"
1065260,1067260,"Yes, this cold is awful.",1062900,1065400,"SPEAKER_20"
