77000,104000,"Captain Blood and his band of feared pirates had sailed the seas for many years,",74000,80100,"SPEAKER_00"
104000,107000,"but never could he remember a storm such as this.",99900,107400,"SPEAKER_15"
107000,113000,"He began to wonder whether his ship could withstand the battering and buffeting of the angry waves for much longer.",99900,107400,"SPEAKER_15"
113000,119000,"Alas, it is now too late to launch the lifeboat he thought, as he lashed himself to the wheel.",107700,113200,"SPEAKER_15"
119000,121000,"His voice rose against the wind.",113500,147700,"SPEAKER_15"
121000,128000,"Captain Blood can think of no better death than to journey to the bottom of the sea, losing the last battle against his old adversary.",113500,147700,"SPEAKER_15"
129000,135000,"But if only I could see the life of the young and beautiful princess who I rescued from the dupe scallion before a ciker,",113500,147700,"SPEAKER_15"
135000,143000,"I care not about the three chests of doubloons, two chests of jewels and 36 bales of the richest and most colorful silks,",113500,147700,"SPEAKER_15"

165000,167000,"It sounded like a tree breaking.",164800,165000,"SPEAKER_05"
168000,169000,"Hey, Moonman.",168000,173000,"SPEAKER_05"
169000,171000,"Mmm, why don't you read your story out loud?",168000,173000,"SPEAKER_05"
171000,172000,"Oh, okay.",168000,173000,"SPEAKER_05"

174000,180000,"As long as you tell us what's happened before, we won't know what it's about, and we might have missed something important.",173000,174400,"SPEAKER_06"
180000,182000,"Just the main points will do, Moonman.",174800,180100,"SPEAKER_06"
182000,184000,"Well, there's this brave pirate.",180200,181800,"SPEAKER_14"

188000,189000,"Captain Blood.",186600,187500,"SPEAKER_05"
189000,193000,"And he and his men have captured a rich and royal gallery.",188100,192900,"SPEAKER_05"
193000,197000,"They've taken lots of gold, silver, and jewels and things.",192900,193400,"SPEAKER_16"
197000,199000,"And oh, yes, a princess too.",194000,199100,"SPEAKER_05"
199000,201000,"It's exciting, isn't it?",194000,199100,"SPEAKER_05"
201000,202000,"Yes, it is.",199400,202300,"SPEAKER_05"
204000,209000,"The storm that rose that night was so violent that at first,",199400,202300,"SPEAKER_05"
209000,214000,"it seemed inevitable the ship found before the waves had engulfed it.",208300,209600,"SPEAKER_03"
214000,217000,"Not bad, if I say so myself.",210000,213800,"SPEAKER_03"

255000,258000,"Snork Maiden, when is your brother coming home?",252000,255100,"SPEAKER_06"
258000,260000,"Oh, he didn't say exactly.",255900,258300,"SPEAKER_03"
260000,262000,"But in a couple of days, I should think.",259000,261600,"SPEAKER_05"
262000,266000,"It was a good idea to let Snork make him stay while he was away.",259000,261600,"SPEAKER_05"
266000,268000,"Wasn't it, Papa?",262800,267400,"SPEAKER_05"
268000,273000,"Yes, it wouldn't be very nice to be all on your own at night in a storm like this.",267900,272800,"SPEAKER_03"
273000,275000,"Not at all.",267900,272800,"SPEAKER_03"
289000,291000,"She seems to be sinking.",273700,274700,"SPEAKER_05"
291000,294000,"She won't be able to hold out much longer.",290000,291400,"SPEAKER_07"
294000,296000,"We must get to the crew without delay.",291500,296100,"SPEAKER_07"

299000,3e+05,"Any survivors?",296700,3e+05,"SPEAKER_07"
3e+05,303000,"We haven't found anyone yet.",296700,3e+05,"SPEAKER_07"
303000,306000,"So what about further along the coast?",300700,302600,"SPEAKER_07"
306000,309000,"Any reports of survivors turning up?",304000,308600,"SPEAKER_07"
309000,312000,"No, I'm afraid not, Inspector. We haven't heard anything.",304000,308600,"SPEAKER_07"
312000,314000,"Well, tell me if you do.",310000,312200,"SPEAKER_09"
314000,315000,"Ah, Inspector?",312400,312400,"SPEAKER_09"
314000,315000,"Ah, Inspector?",312400,314100,"SPEAKER_07"
315000,316000,"Yes.",314100,320300,"SPEAKER_09"
316000,319000,"It seems to me it was a pirate ship that sunk.",314100,320300,"SPEAKER_09"
319000,321000,"What did you say?",314100,320300,"SPEAKER_09"
322000,326000,"Well, I'm pretty sure I saw the skull and crossbones flying from the mast.",314100,320300,"SPEAKER_09"
326000,330000,"And I think I caught sight of a cannon, but I could have been mistaken.",322500,331000,"SPEAKER_09"
330000,331000,"You must be joking.",322500,331000,"SPEAKER_09"
331000,332000,"I never joke.",331000,338000,"SPEAKER_07"
332000,334000,"I can't see anything.",331000,338000,"SPEAKER_07"
334000,338000,"It's too far away to make out any sort of skull and crossbones.",331000,338000,"SPEAKER_07"
338000,339000,"Try this.",331000,338000,"SPEAKER_07"
339000,341000,"Ah, you've got a telescope.",338800,343800,"SPEAKER_07"
341000,344000,"Now why didn't you let me have this before? It might have helped.",338800,343800,"SPEAKER_07"
352000,353000,"Oh!",350500,352100,"SPEAKER_20"
361000,363000,"Ah, that's it. She's gone.",360400,362600,"SPEAKER_07"
368000,372000,"I suppose that there aren't many pirate ships around today.",360400,362600,"SPEAKER_07"
372000,376000,"Any that are afloat must be so old that they'd probably break up easily.",368500,385700,"SPEAKER_03"
376000,381000,"That's if it was a pirate ship, but it sure looked like one right enough.",368500,385700,"SPEAKER_03"
381000,384000,"Nothing's been washed up on the shore yet.",368500,385700,"SPEAKER_03"
384000,386000,"No, not a thing.",368500,385700,"SPEAKER_03"
389000,393000,"Isn't it strange that I was reading that book about pirates yesterday?",389000,392900,"SPEAKER_05"
393000,396000,"They probably wouldn't be quite so romantic in real life.",393000,395700,"SPEAKER_08"
396000,4e+05,"Well, in the book they were really great. I wish I'd been one.",395700,399200,"SPEAKER_05"
4e+05,401000,"A pirate?",399900,399900,"SPEAKER_08"
4e+05,401000,"A pirate?",399900,400600,"SPEAKER_09"
401000,403000,"Yeah, what could be more exciting?",400500,402400,"SPEAKER_05"
403000,404000,"You can't mean that.",402800,404100,"SPEAKER_09"
404000,410000,"Oh, yes, I do. To sail across the seven seas, the holds of your ship's crowned with treasures.",402800,404100,"SPEAKER_09"
410000,414000,"But you'd have to steal the treasure from somebody first, so, Moomin.",406000,410600,"SPEAKER_05"
414000,417000,"Well, yes, all right. I suppose so.",410700,413700,"SPEAKER_09"
417000,420000,"But I wouldn't steal anything from anyone.",414600,417100,"SPEAKER_05"
420000,424000,"Then you're just a sailor. Not a pirate at all.",417500,419700,"SPEAKER_05"
429000,431000,"Moomin, Mama, do you know where Moomin is?",420800,424200,"SPEAKER_09"
432000,434000,"He's probably in Snuffkin's tent.",431900,435100,"SPEAKER_06"
434000,435000,"Oh, yes.",431900,435100,"SPEAKER_06"
435000,438000,"Nork Maiden, I have a letter for you.",431900,435100,"SPEAKER_06"
438000,441000,"Here you are. It's from the snork.",435100,437300,"SPEAKER_18"
441000,444000,"Oh, thank you. Wait a minute, little Mai.",438900,441300,"SPEAKER_18"
444000,446000,"I want to read Snork's letter.",443100,446100,"SPEAKER_06"
446000,448000,"Take your time.",443100,446100,"SPEAKER_06"
455000,458000,"Oh, what's the matter?",447900,448000,"SPEAKER_18"
458000,461000,"It's Snork. He's coming home today.",457000,457800,"SPEAKER_04"
461000,462000,"That's nice.",458500,460800,"SPEAKER_04"
462000,465000,"But Moomin, Mama, there's no food in the house at all.",461200,464900,"SPEAKER_04"
465000,468000,"Now, don't worry about that, Snork Maiden.",461200,464900,"SPEAKER_04"
468000,472000,"I'll whistle up some dinner for us, and Snork can tell us all about his trip.",466000,473900,"SPEAKER_14"
472000,474000,"Boom and Papa like that.",466000,473900,"SPEAKER_14"
474000,477000,"Oh, thank you, Mama. Snork doesn't like missing his meals.",473900,479700,"SPEAKER_06"
477000,480000,"He must have got the part sooner than he thought.",473900,479700,"SPEAKER_06"
480000,482000,"Ha! That's great news.",473900,479700,"SPEAKER_06"
482000,484000,"Then he should finish his flying ship soon, hey?",480900,485800,"SPEAKER_06"
484000,486000,"I guess so.",480900,485800,"SPEAKER_06"
487000,489000,"He should make it into a pirate flying ship.",487000,494300,"SPEAKER_06"
489000,493000,"I could be his first maid, and no one would be able to catch us.",487000,494300,"SPEAKER_06"
493000,495000,"Nobody at all!",487000,494300,"SPEAKER_06"
498000,499000,"Not here.",487000,494300,"SPEAKER_06"
499000,503000,"Oh, dear. I wonder where they've gone, little Mai.",498100,498900,"SPEAKER_06"
503000,505000,"There's nobody here.",499300,501900,"SPEAKER_06"
505000,509000,"Moomin probably wanted to go looking for an adventure.",503500,504800,"SPEAKER_06"
509000,512000,"I bet they went down to the beach to see if anything's been washed out.",505600,511900,"SPEAKER_06"
512000,515000,"At least the hangar's not been damaged.",505600,511900,"SPEAKER_06"
515000,518000,"Let's go down to the beach. We may find a treasure chest.",515000,517800,"SPEAKER_06"
520000,521000,"Huh?",515000,517800,"SPEAKER_06"
524000,525000,"What is it?",520300,520300,"SPEAKER_17"
524000,525000,"What is it?",520300,520600,"SPEAKER_06"
525000,528000,"I just thought I heard something.",524300,524900,"SPEAKER_06"
528000,530000,"Where? From in there.",527400,527500,"SPEAKER_04"
530000,532000,"Hmm, weird.",528200,529800,"SPEAKER_06"
532000,535000,"Oh, I know. The snork must have come back.",530400,531200,"SPEAKER_06"
535000,538000,"Oh, yes. Snork. Of course.",532200,534500,"SPEAKER_06"
539000,541000,"Hello, Snork.",535100,537500,"SPEAKER_04"
542000,544000,"Oh, Snork? Are you in here?",539700,540600,"SPEAKER_04"
546000,548000,"Ah!",543400,544400,"SPEAKER_04"
551000,553000,"Snork me!",550900,552200,"SPEAKER_16"
560000,562000,"Put her down.",553400,556000,"SPEAKER_16"
564000,567000,"Oh, really? It was actually a pirate ship.",560300,561200,"SPEAKER_06"
567000,571000,"It was indeed Moomin, Papa, and we caught the pirates when they swam ashore.",564100,564100,"SPEAKER_03"
567000,571000,"It was indeed Moomin, Papa, and we caught the pirates when they swam ashore.",564100,571000,"SPEAKER_07"
571000,574000,"Do you think you captured all of them, Inspector?",564100,564100,"SPEAKER_03"
571000,574000,"Do you think you captured all of them, Inspector?",564100,571000,"SPEAKER_07"
574000,578000,"Well, of course, we don't know exactly how many there were to begin with.",571600,578400,"SPEAKER_07"
578000,580000,"Hmm, right.",571600,578400,"SPEAKER_07"
580000,585000,"We better barricade ourselves in Moomin's house just to be on the safe side.",578800,584800,"SPEAKER_03"
585000,590000,"Oh, dear. And I suppose I ought to stand guard over my greenhouse as well.",584800,590100,"SPEAKER_13"
593000,596000,"Lace me, ma'am. Come here, little panic.",584800,590100,"SPEAKER_13"
596000,6e+05,"Do let Snork me go. You'll be sorry. You great big hairy folly.",595100,595400,"SPEAKER_13"
6e+05,605000,"No, not in your life, though. It's just my hostage. I need her to make good my escape, ma'am.",596200,600700,"SPEAKER_06"
605000,608000,"Then you only have yourself to blame.",600500,605800,"SPEAKER_11"
608000,610000,"Hey, what?",605800,608100,"SPEAKER_06"
610000,613000,"Blame? Stay where you are now. I will not be bitten again.",610000,610800,"SPEAKER_11"
613000,615000,"Keep away, little cat.",610900,614800,"SPEAKER_11"
615000,617000,"Well, don't hurt her then.",610900,614800,"SPEAKER_11"
617000,621000,"Hurt her, you little shark. She's a hostage and I call me one of that.",615200,616500,"SPEAKER_06"
621000,624000,"She'll be my safe passenger. These rough waters are perished.",617300,624300,"SPEAKER_11"
624000,626000,"Well, then you better take me instead.",617300,624300,"SPEAKER_11"
626000,628000,"Because I'm much easier to carry.",624500,626400,"SPEAKER_06"
628000,633000,"You, huh? Nobody would care if I fed you slowly to the shrimps.",626900,628500,"SPEAKER_06"
633000,636000,"Oh, yes, lots of people. When you overstab win, ma'am.",632100,632800,"SPEAKER_06"
636000,641000,"All right, all right. Hold your head with gloomy down. Now, what's your name, girl?",634900,640600,"SPEAKER_11"
641000,642000,"I'm Lil Mai.",641000,641900,"SPEAKER_06"
