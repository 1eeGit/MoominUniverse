0	21000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.
29000	35000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.
35000	46000	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,
46000	59000	there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.
76000	99200	Winter was just around the corner and that was the time of year for movement to get restless.
99200	120400	Because this was the time of year for Snuffkin to leave Moomin Valley on his yearly trek south.
120400	123200	Good morning, Papa. That bonfire looks inviting.
123200	130400	Now you're up already. We're buried in leaves this morning after that wind last night.
130400	135200	Yes, winders on the way. Oh, this is a lovely bonfire.
135200	137200	Yes, isn't it?
137200	142400	I guess we're hibernating again this winter. Are we moving, Papa?
142400	146800	Well, of course. We always hibernate in the winter.
146800	152400	If Snuffkin says I could go with him, couldn't I give this winter a miss and hibernate longer next year?
152800	155600	Mord. Oh, please, Moomin, Papa.
155600	158800	Snuffkin would rather go alone, I think, Moomin.
158800	162000	But I might get him to train his mind.
162000	165200	But Snuffkin's not really a person who likes to be pressed.
165200	167200	Why not?
167200	173600	Well, he's a very solitary person. His winter trip is the only time he can really be alone for a while.
173600	176400	I know, but I was just hoping.
176400	180000	Snuffkin likes you very much. I know that.
180000	184000	And I think that's why he stays in Moomin Valley for the rest of the year.
184000	189200	But at heart, he's a vagabond and he needs time away from us.
189200	192400	He's not a family man, so he's free to do as he wants.
192400	195600	And as his friend, you should try to understand.
195600	199600	I know you'd like to go with him, but I don't think it is such a good idea.
199600	202000	He'd really hate to turn you down, I know.
202000	204000	I guess.
204000	206000	But he'd have to.
206000	210000	Oh.
220000	222000	Oh.
222000	224000	Why aren't they biting?
224000	227000	I haven't had a proper catch for days.
227000	230000	Getting too cold, is that?
232000	234000	When are you leaving?
234000	236000	You're about to leave, aren't you?
236000	238000	Yes.
242000	244000	Could I ask you something?
244000	246000	What?
246000	248000	Don't go without telling me.
248000	250000	But why?
250000	254000	I'm always sad when you leave, even though I know you'll return in the spring.
254000	257000	Yeah. Me too, sort of.
257000	260000	That's why this year I'd plan to leave without saying anything.
260000	264000	But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly.
264000	266000	I'd like to wish you good luck and all that.
266000	268000	I miss you so much when you're away.
268000	270000	Please, Snuffkin.
270000	272000	Moomin, I have a better idea.
272000	274000	I won't leave until after you've started hibernating.
274000	276000	Then you won't miss me, will you?
276000	278000	You're right.
278000	280000	I'll take a great idea, Snuffkin.
280000	282000	Then we won't really part at all, won't we?
282000	284000	Nope.
284000	288000	Because I promised to be back here in Moomin Valley before you even woken up.
288000	292000	Wonderful. What a super idea.
292000	296000	Hey, Moomin!
296000	298000	Oh, Snuff.
298000	300000	Moomin, come here a minute.
300000	302000	There's something funny caught up in a tree.
302000	304000	What do you mean, funny?
304000	306000	I don't know exactly. Never saw anything like it before.
306000	310000	Snortmain a little my-founded first, but it's too high to get it down.
310000	314000	Okay, I'll come have a look.
318000	320000	Be careful.
322000	326000	Be careful. What is it, Moomin?
328000	330000	I know what it is. It's a kite.
330000	332000	Oh, what?
332000	334000	A kite is something you fly in the sky.
334000	336000	But it has no wings.
336000	340000	No, you send it up against the wind on a string.
340000	348000	That's right!
352000	354000	Oh!
360000	363000	That's right.
363000	370000	Where'd it go?
370000	373000	Oh, through it though.
373000	380000	That's all right.
380000	389000	Oh, song, this is what a kite looks like.
389000	391000	Looks broken to me.
391000	394000	I'm sure we can fix it and make it fly.
394000	395000	Let's see.
395000	396000	Oh, no.
396000	398000	The string must have broken when someone was flying it
398000	400000	and the wind blew it down into the tree.
400000	402000	Well, why don't we repair it?
402000	403000	Yes, let's.
403000	406000	Looks pretty badly broken to me.
406000	407000	Well, I don't know.
407000	411000	We'll have to see.
411000	413000	It is a kite, isn't it?
413000	415000	Can we mend it?
415000	418000	Maybe.
421000	423000	A very odd kite.
423000	425000	It must have come from far away.
425000	427000	You think it can be repaired?
427000	428000	Of course.
428000	429000	Well, come on then.
429000	431000	Snork will help you repair it.
431000	433000	I can repair it without your help.
433000	436000	As long as you can find us some really long string,
436000	439000	strong but not too thick if possible.
439000	441000	I think I have what you need.
441000	443000	Some string.
443000	444000	Good. Excellent.
444000	446000	I'll start immediately.
451000	453000	Good.
453000	455000	Good.
455000	457000	Good.
457000	459000	Good.
459000	461000	Good.
461000	463000	Good.
463000	466000	Good.
466000	469000	Good.
469000	472000	Good.
472000	475000	Good.
475000	478000	Good.
478000	480000	Good.
481000	484000	Good.
484000	487000	Good.
487000	490000	Good.
490000	492000	Good.
492000	494000	Good.
494000	498000	Good.
498000	501000	Good.
501000	505000	Good.
505000	508000	Good.
508000	512000	A really exciting project I haven't flown a kite for years.
512000	515000	I do hope that string is long enough.
515000	517000	Snowark, is this okay?
517000	519000	Fine, who's gonna fly it?
519000	521000	I'll do it.
521000	522000	Ok, Sniff.
522000	525000	Moving, hold the kite up high.
525000	526000	Like this?
526000	527000	Hmm.
527000	529000	Alright, Sniff, are you ready?
529000	533000	Yeah, I'm ready. Don't let go till I say win.
533000	535000	Hmm?
535000	539000	Win, moment!
539000	542000	Oh!
542000	547000	Uh oh, it's falling.
547000	553000	Try again, and this time start running, and when the wind catches the kite, you start paying out the light.
553000	556000	Alright, fine. Hold it up again, moment.
556000	558000	Right.
558000	559000	Ready?
559000	562000	Yeah, I'm ready. Let go of it!
562000	567000	Is it going up yet?
567000	569000	No, it isn't!
569000	573000	Stop, Sniff! You're breaking the kite!
573000	577000	I don't think this kite's any good for anybody!
577000	580000	The kite's fine. It's just that the wind is too weak.
580000	584000	Alright, we'll have to wait for it to get stronger.
584000	587000	Titty though, we certainly had a good strong wind yesterday.
587000	589000	Is it okay?
589000	592000	I think the wind is getting stronger, moment.
609000	611000	There it goes!
612000	616000	With me, hold the string, moment.
616000	619000	Boy, this wind is really strong! Can I let out the string now?
619000	623000	Do it slowly, mind. Alright!
623000	627000	Let me do it, Sniff, come on, it's my turn!
627000	631000	Let me break your kite, little boy.
631000	634000	Why not? Because you don't win, I'm told it!
634000	636000	I'm very strong!
636000	639000	Boy, it's quite right, you go up with it!
652000	654000	You're Sniff!
654000	655000	Yes, Papa?
655000	658000	It's difficult to hold it for a while.
658000	660000	Well, yes, you'd like it.
660000	663000	Hold it really tight, then.
667000	670000	Alright, I could do this long before he was born.
670000	672000	Oops!
674000	677000	What's happening?
677000	680000	Papa, why did you drop quickly?
680000	683000	Hey, I'm winding, I'm winding.
683000	684000	Faster!
684000	686000	Oh, winding faster!
686000	692000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
696000	699000	That was definitely not my fault.
699000	702000	Of course it wasn't, with such a strong wind up there,
702000	705000	I think we have to lower the center of gravity a bit.
708000	711000	The kite's alright, Papa?
711000	714000	Hmm, maybe it would take me with it.
727000	729000	That's it!
729000	733000	I suppose that's to stop it from spinning around, is it snorke?
733000	735000	Yes, that's right.
741000	743000	What is it?
745000	748000	Listen, I'm going to ride that kite.
748000	750000	What did you say?
750000	753000	I think it's going to be okay now.
753000	757000	If I hold on really tight, I think I could have a wonderful ride on that kite.
757000	760000	Yes, maybe it'd be wonderful while you're up in the sky,
760000	763000	but you've seen how fast it can come down again.
763000	766000	But the snorke just said it won't fall down again.
766000	767000	Even so!
767000	768000	I'm going to do it.
768000	772000	But no one must see me or they might try to stop me if they guess what I'm up to.
772000	774000	Oh, please don't do it.
774000	776000	What are you doing?
776000	778000	Listen carefully.
778000	780000	Yes.
780000	783000	When we fly the kite next time...
783000	784000	Huh?
784000	786000	What are you two whispering about?
786000	788000	We weren't snorked, Maiden.
788000	791000	I was just saying to Sniff that the kite wouldn't fall down again.
791000	793000	It won't! Snork is fixed it.
793000	795000	But you can't be absolutely sure.
795000	798000	And you'll be holding the kite, won't you, Sniff?
798000	799000	Me?
799000	801000	Now then, do you want to do it, woman?
801000	804000	Yes, and this time I'll let out all the line.
804000	807000	And Sniff, you could hold it up, okay?
807000	809000	Yes, that's fine.
809000	811000	I'm counting on you, Sniff.
811000	813000	And so am I, Sniff.
823000	825000	Are you sure you'll be all right?
825000	827000	Of course I will, silly.
827000	829000	Well, I'm not so sure.
829000	831000	Why don't you keep your eyes closed then?
831000	833000	Good idea.
833000	835000	Okay, Sniff.
835000	837000	Let go of it when I say ready.
837000	839000	Bye.
842000	844000	Ready!
868000	869000	Yeah!
882000	884000	That's it. That's all of the line.
884000	886000	It's very high.
886000	888000	Must be some wind up there.
888000	890000	It's flying really well, isn't it?
890000	892000	Certainly is.
893000	895000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
895000	897000	This is getting bumpy.
897000	898000	Oh!
901000	902000	What's that?
902000	905000	I'd say there's something very strange happening on that kite.
905000	907000	What is it?
907000	909000	I can't see properly from here.
909000	911000	I saw something.
911000	913000	Could it be a bird, maybe?
913000	916000	The kite is turned again, but it wasn't a bird.
916000	918000	Or a twig or something, then?
918000	919000	I can't see.
919000	922000	Do you see the back of the kite from where you are, Sniff?
922000	925000	No, Mom and Mama, because my eyes are closed.
925000	926000	Oh.
926000	928000	I think I know who it is.
928000	929000	Little Mai.
929000	930000	What?
934000	936000	No, I haven't seen that on my phone.
936000	938000	She seems to have disappeared.
938000	939000	Don't ask me anything.
939000	941000	I know nothing at all about it.
941000	943000	Sniff, what do you mean?
943000	946000	She was dead set on riding the kite.
946000	947000	I couldn't stop her.
947000	948000	What?
948000	951000	Moment, bring it down very slowly.
951000	952000	Huh?
961000	962000	Take it easy, Moment.
962000	963000	That wind is strong.
963000	965000	It could break the line.
967000	969000	But that was what a friend was best streamed.
969000	971000	It's the knot I wore in the board knot.
971000	976000	The warmth between our line and the bit that was still hanging from the kite when we found it.
977000	979000	The knot is fine.
979000	980000	If the knot is another knot.
987000	989000	It's over.
989000	990000	Oh my God.
990000	991000	It's over.
991000	993000	It's over.
993000	994000	It's over.
1004000	1005000	Hang on tight.
1006000	1007000	Little Mai.
1007000	1009000	That wind is getting stronger.
1012000	1015000	Oh, this is more scarier than I thought.
1018000	1020000	I'll just have to hang on as best as I can.
1023000	1024000	Don't move around so much.
1024000	1026000	I can't help it.
1027000	1029000	It's almost down.
1030000	1031000	What?
1036000	1037000	Oh.
1044000	1046000	It's not open.
1046000	1047000	Come on.
1047000	1048000	Jeff, get up.
1048000	1049000	All right.
1050000	1052000	Snort, play yourself together.
1052000	1053000	Yes, all right.
1056000	1058000	She's being blown away towards lonely mountain.
1058000	1059000	Snort.
1059000	1061000	Oh.
1061000	1064000	I do hope little Mai really is indestructible.
1066000	1068000	Where in the world is this kite taking me?
1071000	1073000	All lonely mountains.
1073000	1075000	I'm a long way from home.
1083000	1084000	Little Mai.
1084000	1086000	Little Mai.
1086000	1088000	Now she's going towards the forest of witches.
1088000	1091000	She'll be all right if she fell into a tree when she...
1093000	1094000	I can't see her.
1094000	1095000	There's no sign of her.
1095000	1098000	Well, I'm almost sure she was heading this way.
1101000	1102000	What is it, Sniff?
1102000	1104000	Imagine she might have fallen somewhere.
1104000	1107000	She might be lying there waiting for help.
1107000	1110000	Oh, stop imagining things, Sniff.
1110000	1111000	She's still up there.
1111000	1112000	I'm sure of it.
1115000	1116000	What is it, Papa?
1116000	1118000	I saw something up there.
1118000	1119000	Little Mai?
1119000	1121000	No, Sniff.
1121000	1125000	No, it looked more like the Hobgoblin riding his panther through the sky.
1125000	1126000	Really?
1126000	1128000	Did you see that?
1128000	1129000	Did you?
1129000	1130000	You found me, Mai.
1133000	1134000	No, the Hobgoblin.
1134000	1135000	Then it was him.
1135000	1136000	Forget the Hobgoblin.
1136000	1140000	We're looking for Little Mai and all you can think of is the Hobgoblin.
1140000	1141000	Hobgoblin.
1150000	1151000	Oh, come on.
1151000	1152000	I won't shoot you.
1170000	1172000	Stop it, you're screaming.
1172000	1174000	Let go of my hair.
1174000	1175000	Stop it.
1187000	1189000	Where could she be?
1189000	1190000	This is no good.
1190000	1193000	We'll never find her wondering about like this.
1194000	1196000	Moomin, over here.
1196000	1197000	You found her?
1201000	1203000	There she is.
1210000	1212000	Try to cheer up, Snork Maiden.
1212000	1213000	I'll try.
1213000	1215000	Don't worry, Snork Maiden.
1215000	1217000	Moomin, Papa, will find her for sure.
1221000	1224000	Mama, Snork Maiden!
1225000	1227000	I'm so glad to see you.
1227000	1230000	But I just knew you'd be all right.
1230000	1234000	Like Moomin Mama said, Little Mai really is indestructible.
1234000	1239000	But just possibly it served her right to have her hair pulled.
1239000	1241000	There's still no sign of Little Mai?
1241000	1242000	No.
1245000	1246000	Be careful, Moomin!
1247000	1249000	Lizzo!
1262000	1263000	Be careful, Moomin!
1263000	1287360	Finally, the name was rescued too, but he almost certainly had a fun worst scare than
1287360	1288320	that were all mine.
1317360	1327360	The move ends, the move ends
