    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're here for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They are the movements.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, what do you think?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. Here with me, here for you on your TV They are the movements, they are the movements

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So come with me, give me your hand

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'll take you up to a moment land

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You can fly just like a bird

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Sing that song ever, there were the movements

00:00:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
There were the movements, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la Now it's very nice to get letters, at least every now and then.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
However, in Mumen Valley, they're rarely sent or received.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And yet they do have letter boxes and even postman.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:25.479
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, All in this time. What? Come on. This way, towards me. Come on.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.000
Come on.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.800
Oh!

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.800
So, my God!

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.960
I got him!

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.280
Did you take that hole?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.800
Yeah.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.639
No, weren't, didn't it?

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:35.439
All right.

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.159
Who's responsible for this?

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.280
Are you all right?

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.840
Did you take this hole, young woman?

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.879
Of course not.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:51.460
Who was it then?

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.800
Hi, you I should have known.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.000
Come here, you just wait.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.500
Uh, hold on, Mr. Postman. Can I help my letter please?

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:20.199
Just you wait. The past is too late.

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.400
Here's a letter, Mama.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.960
Hmm.

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.400
A goodness, a letter.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I think it's from Mumble. Oh, really?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Where's little my, Mum?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Well, she's um...

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So, who's this letter from?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It's from my sister mumble, isn't it?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Oh, should I know?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
She went on holiday to get away from me.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I bet she's coming back because she's missed all the fun.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.520
She'd stay away if she had it in the sense.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.000
This is the third time I've fallen into a hole.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.360
Yes, I know.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.280
But this is only the first time I've seen you do it.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.639
What a horrible little child you are.

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.319
Artite.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.080
Whoo!

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.240
Whoo, that was close.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.159
Go on, fall off.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.000
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Go on, Fola! Whoop!

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Come here, wait till I get my hands on you!

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Mumble says that she's coming back.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
She feels that she's ready to cope with Little My again.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Oh, that's good news, Mum and Mama.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I think that we should go and give her house a good clean.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.680
Have you told Little My now Mumbles coming?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.040
She'll be able to go home.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.600
No, I expect the postman is still chasing her

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.120
around the garden.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.279
Don't tell me why I don't want to know.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.079
Mama, mama, is the letter from Mumbles?

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:42.480
What does she have to say?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.319
Is she coming home?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And a few days later, Mumbles Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, That's Mum and Valley over there. It's not full of creepy crawlies, is it?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Not as far as I know.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Is there a house over there?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Maybe they have food, let's go.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Oh, that's Mum and House.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Oh!

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Are you going to Mumomin Valley, too?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Yes, we got me red.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
That's nice, so am I.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We can go together.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Your suitcase looks very heavy.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Would you like a hand with me?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
No, no, no, no!

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Okay.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Are they nice the people that live in that house?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Yes they are.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Could we stay there?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I'm sure you can.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
My little sister is staying with them.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Follow me. I know the way. Shall we go?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
What's the matter?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Nothing. We're following you.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
All right.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Mumbo!

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Hello. How are you?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Fine, you.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.800
Jamnice, rest without me. Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:34.399
Oh, by the way, I'm at two very small strangers who said they were coming here.

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:36.399
Coming here, mumble?

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:40.199
Yes, they're both the same size as little mine.

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:44.600
Both a bit odd and they're carrying a very large suitcase.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.500
Right, I'd better make them up a small double bed then.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.500
Thanks for the tea.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.500
Now are you ready to come home with me now little my?

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.000
No, not yet.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.500
We've got to go home and tidy the house.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.000
It hasn't been aired for the whole winter.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.500
It's all right, mumble.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.000
I cleaned and swept the floors the other day and opened all the doors and windows.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Thank you very much. It must have been a relief to be asleep most of the time with Lamai's been staying with you.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
They said they haven't been bored once since we woke up, and we've had a really good time together.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Isn't that right, Mumen?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Bye now.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Well, well.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
What does well-well me, Papa?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Just that I might be able to hear myself think again now.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I know what you mean.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
You're not thingin' me. No, it's your turn to be great. What if they scream when they see us?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
But the lady told us they were friendly thingamy.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Go on, do it.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Excuse me?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
No, no, no.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Oh, no.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Oh, no.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Oh, no.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Go on, do it.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Excuse me?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
No!

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Now, what's the matter with you two?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:45.080
Don't forget your suitcase, will you? I'm so glad to see you, Mom! What are you doing there? Oh.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.480
Well, nobody said that you did.

00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:50.639
Then you haven't come to arrest us.

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:51.840
Have you?

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.360
Of course I haven't.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.360
I've come to see the movement family.

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:01.240
It is our suitcase.

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:02.919
It is.

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.639
Of course it is.

00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:07.000
Now if you come to see the movements too?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Hello?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Oh, there you are. I thought it was you.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Are you expecting these two guests, Smoomin Mama?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I think so. And they've got a suitcase, so they must be staying.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.120
That's nice. You will stay, won't you?

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.120
Is it alright with you?

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.799
Of course it is. I'm Moomin' Mama.

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:36.320
I'm Dengany, and this is my friend Bob Moomin' Mama.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.159
You're welcome. Come in and make yourselves at home.

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:43.360
I think it'll be okay, Dengany.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Careful! He must must have drive it!

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
They are a bit strange, aren't they?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Yes, definitely.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
So, what can I do for you today, Inspector?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Oh, well, I heard that mumble was back from holiday, so...

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Yes, that's right.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Oh, do you hear now?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
No inspector, I'm afraid she's gone home with little Mai.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Oh, right.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I have to keep an eye on things, you know? Very important.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Who goes away? Who comes back?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Well, I'll say goodbye then, Mum and Baba.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I do believe he's fallen for mumble.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But has she fallen for him?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I wonder.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
What if the new guests do he?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Looking scared mostly.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Who one, do one, do one. Here you are. I've emptied these drawers for you. There should be enough room. Thank you, Mormon.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Where should we put this suitcase? Let's see.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
In this drawer?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Oh, the other place to hide too.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Oh look at this.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
They made such a pretty bad boy's.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I like the movements. They didn't scream at all.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:53.000
You still gotta be careful though. We've had some very strange people staying at our house, but I think these two are really weird.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Well, they're northerners.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I guess so, with names like Thingamy and Bob.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And that suitcase.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
They look a lot like fugitives to me, Snuffkin.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And perhaps they're dangerous criminals on the run.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Do you want to see them?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Yeah, I wouldn't mind, movement. Oh.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Ah, there you are. What are they doing now?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
No idea. I couldn't hear anything, so they must be asleep.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
We think they're fugitives, Moomin Papa. They're probably on the run from the law.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Well, they are a bit funny about their suitcase.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Gold coins.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Stolen state secrets.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Arsonists. We better hide all the matches, Papa.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.159
Public enemies, numbers one and two,

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:08.840
but they don't look like it, though.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.639
How about some tea, Snuffkin, sniff?

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:12.679
Yes, please.

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:36.600
Any cakes as well? Oh

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Bename Oh no! This suitcase is gone too! What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? You wake already? What a nerfie you're doing under the bed!

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
It's the safest place!

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Something's about to happen there! I can feel her coming.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
That's what woke me up.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Don't be silly. She can't know we're here.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
She can. And I know she'll be here tonight.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Hmm. It's very windy tonight, moment.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
MMM. You windy tonight, moment.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Mmm, now chilly too, don't you think?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Mmm, oh, hello.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Did you sleep well?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Would you like some tea?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Hey, so that's them!

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Don't worry.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
These are good friends of mine.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Let me introduce you.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Sniff and snuff can.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And what's the matter?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
She's coming! Yes, she is.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Well, who is my dear?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
The girl. The girl.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Yes, she's terrible.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Who?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
You know who she is?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Yes, I've never seen her, but I've heard she's a scary monster, all right?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Scary monster?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And this Grog is after you.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Yes, she is. Now don't you worry she'll think twice before she tangles with me.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
We'll see.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
If she's a scary monster.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Monster or not. If you're a guest in Moomin House, nothing will harm you.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Right everyone. Like all the doors and you two go to your room.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Thank you, Moomin Papa.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.600
Nobody is going to get in here. I'm going to get in here. house nothing will harm you. Right everyone, lock all the doors and you two go to your room.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:54.159
Thank you, Moran Papa. Nobody is gonna get in here. Well said. To Am's family, to Am's.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:05.799
Ready for more tea, anyone? What's the matter? We're going to be attacked by a huge scary monster! Heavens!

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:08.700
You'd better get the frying pan, mama.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.200
Oh, dear.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.500
All right.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:46.000
Has everyone got a weapon, huh? I'm going to get you. Well, it's midnight. I don't believe in that stupid grog. I hope you're right.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I hope you're right.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I hope you're right.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I hope you're right.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I hope you're right.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I hope you're right.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I hope you're right.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I hope you're right.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
I hope you're right.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I hope you're right.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
I hope you're right. I hope you're right.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
She's coming. She's here.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:33.599
Yes, she's very close now.

00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:37.000
I'm going home.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.799
This is silly. We can't wait up all night. Besides, I'm getting very sleepy.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.039
It's up to you. Right. I'm going, man moment papa. Watch your back.

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:54.359
Yes, keep in the open. Huh you guys are only trying to frighten me.

00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:57.559
Well, it won't work.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.000
She's here. No, she's not. There are no such things as monsters.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Just a trap blowing a candle, though.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Hmm.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
You see? There's nobody there.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Well, in that case, there's nothing to stop you going home, Sniff.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Hmm?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Well, in that case, there's nothing to stop you going home, Sniff.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
You think I'm scared? You're making it up. Come on, admit it. There aren't any...

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Groakes!

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:56.400
Not at all. Well...

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
You see? There's no one here at all! Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Oh.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Oh.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Oh.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Oh.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Oh, be careful.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Watch what you're doing.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
It's here.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
It's here.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Where?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Hey, right outside that door.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Big and black and horrible!

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Right.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
No, don't open it!

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
You'll get in!

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Come on, everybody.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Well, there's nobody here, Sniff.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Are you sure?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I can't see anything. I must have scared that silly old Groc away, moment!

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
That will teach her to come sniffing around here, all right?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
What the fash is?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:05.720
WAAAAAAA!

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.640
Mm-hmm, Mrs. Groke, we'd like you to go home.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.140
Now you just go on.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.000
You're upsetting our guests.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
And you're freezing my roses?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Yes, you big bully.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I'm sorry, but you really must leave.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Please go before I count to ten. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine and a half. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Hey!

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Hey!

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Hey!

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Hey!

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Hey!

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Hey!

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Hey!

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Hey!

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Hey!

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Hey!

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Hey!

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Hey!

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Hey!

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Hey!

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Hey!

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Hey!

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Hey!

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Hey!

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Hey!

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Are you alright, Moomboma? Look at the ground!

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
It's all frozen! Help me, Dad!

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Help me, Dad!

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
That's a Groke's voice!

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
It's cold!

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Isn't it?

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
I don't think she'll be back tonight. It's cold, isn't it?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
I don't think she'll be back tonight.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Let's all go in and have a hot drink.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
The Groke didn't come back that night,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
but what did she want in the movement house?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
And will she return perhaps another night

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
when they're all asleep.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
They love the laughter and they love the living,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
the movements, believing in sharing and caring

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
and giving the movements.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
They're always happy and always at play.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
The movements.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
The movements.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
They love the laughter and they love the living.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:51.000
The movements, believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
They're always happy and goes and played.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:11.000
The movements are having moment, the moment.
