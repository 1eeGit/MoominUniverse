00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's a lovely day, and at last, movement is persuaded to come out for a walk in the lonely mountains.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.040
Oh, it's beautiful up here. Aren't you glad you came now? Ah...

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.439
This is much better than fairy tales, isn't it, Snork Maiden?

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:13.840
Oh, look, Moomin! It's Adelvice!

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.439
Hmm? Adelvice?

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:21.400
No, it isn't. That doesn't grow here at all.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.520
I'm sure it is. I know what it looks like.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.000
I'm sorry, but it's not. Oh, it's just like in Heidi.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
No, it's not. It's just a daisy.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Oh, come on. I want to pick it.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Oh, no, it's too dangerous.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I know then. You can do it.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You're my boyfriend, aren't you, Moomin?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Well, I suppose we could climb down there,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
but I promise you it's not Adelvice.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
That only grows in the Alps and they're hundreds of miles away. You're my boyfriend, aren't you, Moomin? Well, I suppose we could climb down there, but I promise you it's not Adelvice.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.599
That only grows in the Alps and there are hundreds of miles away.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.599
I know it's Adelvice.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.000
Be careful. They don't care about danger and fairy tales.

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:09.199
That's why they call them fairy tales, silly.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.199
Fair Princess, please accept this, my humble offering. Thank you, Brave Knight. You were right, movement. This isn't Adelvice.

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:22.000
See, I told you. It's gonna be hard to get down from here, you know.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.800
Can't we go back the way we came?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.300
Well, I think it'll be easier to try down from here, you know? Can't we go back the way we came?

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.139
Well, I think it'll be easier to try to get to that path.

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.139
If you say so.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.479
It's nearer anyway, and better than going up.

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:42.819
I'm surprised you're such a good climber.

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.599
Oh, Royalty is good at practically everything.

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:46.599
Huh?

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.120
Oh, start playing.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.960
Oh!

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.800
Oh!

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.639
Oh!

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:51.479
Oh!

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:52.479
Oh!

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:53.479
Oh!

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:54.479
Oh!

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.479
Stop playing us!

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:57.479
Oh!

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.479
Oh!

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:59.479
Stop playing us!

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:00.479
Oh!

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:01.479
Oh!

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.479
Oh!

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:04.479
Oh!

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! No!

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Stop, Peter!

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Let me see six petals. Huh.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
What was that? A giant snow ball?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
It can't be, it isn't winter.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.600
Oh well, nothing of interest to me.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.600
Now where was I?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.600
Huh?

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.199
We start handling.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.120
Has Snorkmaiden just gone past you?

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.560
Snorkmaiden, no, all I've seen going past

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.160
is a very large snowball.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.240
That was Snorkmaiden.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.000
But she's not made of snow?

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:44.959
Stop!

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:46.000
Snorkma it! Stop!

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Snork made it! Snork made it!

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Oh, I'll praise the bo'm not. I'm not.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I'm not.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I'm not.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I'm not.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I'm not.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I'm not.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I'm not.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I'm not.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I'm not.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I'm not.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I'm not. I'm not. She's unconscious. What are you trying to do? I want to get her home to Mama.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Oh, difficult. She should lose a bit of weight.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Perhaps she'd come around if we splashed cold water on her face.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
There's nothing to fetch it in.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
If you cut some bark off a tree trunk, you could make a small container.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.500
What a good idea. If you stay here, I'll go and do that.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.800
Wake up, Snorkmaiden.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Oh, that's cold. Has she come round yet, Mr. Hemuelin?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
No.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Okay.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Oh good.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.680
It's working.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.680
How are your feelings, Snark Maiden?

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.000
Are you alright, Snark Maiden?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.240
Oh, where am I?

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.800
We're still up in Lonely Mountains.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.560
Who am I?

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.199
Why Royal Highness the Princess of Lonely Mountains?

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:43.199
What?

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.199
A Princess?

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.000
Oh yes, of course. the princess of Lonely Mountains. What? A princess?

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.959
Oh yes, of course.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.399
And who are you?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.160
I am the prince of Lonely Mountains.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.000
Oh yeah?

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.399
Oh yeah? With that ridiculous shape?

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:57.040
Ha!

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.519
No, a jester perhaps.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.639
You what?

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.360
You there?

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:14.000
Do not laugh!

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:17.600
I think the poor girl must have lost her memory.

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:21.199
Of course not, she's just pretending.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
When does not whisper with royalty present, do you hear? So sorry, your royal highness.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
A poor crafters cabin.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
This is your castle, ma'am.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Royalty doesn't live in shacks.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Snork maiden.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Stop calling us that.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
It's very rude.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.220
Oh, forgive me.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:49.500
Our royal castle is elsewhere. Is it not? What?

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:04.500
That must be a hunting lodge. No, of course that's what it is. Good. We accept that.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Are you two gonna tell me what you're so busy looking at?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Send a mate to my room, my good man. A maid?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
My good man.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Papa, have you seen Snork Maiden?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Yes, up there.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Mama, please would you go on have a word with Snork Maiden?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Have you been quarreling? Oh no. It's just that she fell and banged her head,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and now she thinks she's a royal princess.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
What?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Oh, oh, oh.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Ah, Nanette! Come here, please.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Nanette? I'm Boomin Mama.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Oh, we're too weary for your foolish jokes, girl.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Oh, we are very tired indeed today.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I'm going to go to bed.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I'm going to go to bed.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.860
I'm going to Mama. Oh, we're too weary for your foolish jokes, girl.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.139
Oh, we are very tired indeed, Nanette.

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:15.620
Please bring our silk nightie with the hand embroidered swans and clowns.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.139
Then you may go.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.539
I wish you, Mama.

00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:25.000
All right, I'm sure.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
But she seems convinced she's a princess.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Sounds as if it's dangerous, doesn't it, Mama?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Oh, I don't think so.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I was only joking when I called her a princess.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I'm very glad you didn't call her an opera singer.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
It's not made in the sleep now?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Oh, yes.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
In a night gown with crowns and swans embroidered on it.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And another thing, boom, and she wants a canopy put up immediately.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
What's that?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.500
Oh, a fancy cover over the bed.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.000
It's draped in silks, and velvets, and tassels.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Oh.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.500
She was very upset because there wasn't one there already.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.000
It might be necessary.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Her memory could have come back by the time she wakes up.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.500
Why don't we wait and see?

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.500
She might be fine after a rest.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.080
I sure hope so. But what do we do if it hasn't come back? by the time she wakes up, why don't we wait and see? She might be fine after a rest.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.320
I sure hope so.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.320
But what do we do if it hasn't come back?

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.320
Let's think about that if it happens.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.919
We might not have to build that canopy.

00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:16.039
Let me try it.

00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:16.919
Try what?

00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:19.200
To get Stark Maiden's memory back, what else?

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.440
Oh, how?

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.279
Well, I think that if she sees me, she'll remember me

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:25.000
and then she'll remember everything else, too.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Don't be silly little mind.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
If she doesn't remember me, why should you remember you, eh?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Simple, because I'm unforgettable.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
There is that, I suppose.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
She's still fast asleep.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Well, I'm glad we made the canopy anyway.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
It looks really great, doesn't it?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Oh, oh, look! She's opening her eyes.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Are you awake?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Get up, Snork maiden. Come on!

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Let's go down to the beach!

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And who is that person?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.299
Come on, you remember me. I warn you of you, though you'll be sorry!

00:11:06.539 --> 00:11:08.700
Oh, quite amusing!

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.539
Ah, so you remember me now!

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.240
Of course we do!

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.840
There you are, I told you!

00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:15.299
Who am I then?

00:11:15.580 --> 00:12:05.200
Well, you're another court jester, of course! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, eeeeh, Moment asked me to come over to Moment House and propose to some princess!

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.659
Moments lost his marbles as well then! I think he wanted Stinky as a contrast.

00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:10.500
You what?

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.100
You mean to tell me you're both my rivals for the hands of the royal princess?

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.000
Well, it's not very original, but in order to win the princess.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.600
And half her kingdom, Stinky, you'll need to solve three riddles.

00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:25.960
Hey, that's great! What's this kingdom like?

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.440
All right, sooner number one, you may now enter.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:13:09.000
Oh, that, Princess! How Are you ready?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Fire away!

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Now then, listen. What is it that is yellow has four legs and sings?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Oh, dear. An unusual canary?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
With four legs, you nincomboop.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I don't know any birds with four legs.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.299
Who said it was a bird?

00:13:26.299 --> 00:13:29.279
All right then, what's the answer, snark baby?

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:31.159
He shows no respect.

00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:33.759
Throw him into a dungeon and give him no food.

00:13:33.759 --> 00:13:34.559
You're heinous.

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:37.679
He is temporarily out of his mind after the long journey here.

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:39.879
Hang on, I'm not out of my mind.

00:13:39.879 --> 00:13:41.279
God, up she is.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.480
How for what's the answer?

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.360
That's what I want to know.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.000
Silence, it does not concern you. Out of skin! How for what's the answer? That's what I want to know! Silence!

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
It does not concern you!

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
We believe you to be of lowly birth!

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Sorry about this, Nuffkin.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Don't worry.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Hmm, no, Sir Galaad, but not bad.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I am honored to be here, your Royal Highness.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
He'll do.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
An easy riddle to start.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Here it is.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
First, what is the number of which we think?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Take your time.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Two?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Bravo, Gallant Knight. That is correct.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Now listen, what is the word upon our mind?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Love.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.460
That's amazing!

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.539
Truly, the suitor has brains as well as looks!

00:14:28.539 --> 00:14:31.179
Question three, there are two numbers on our mind.

00:14:31.179 --> 00:14:32.620
What do they add up to?

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.659
Answer carefully for it.

00:14:33.659 --> 00:14:36.259
Could unlock your princess's heart.

00:14:36.259 --> 00:14:37.740
21.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.139
Oh, was that right, too?

00:14:41.139 --> 00:14:49.740
Oh no, it was 22.

00:14:51.799 --> 00:14:54.039
My heart is heavy. For chance we should have said it was correct.

00:14:54.039 --> 00:14:55.440
He was rather cute.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.720
Was he not just her?

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.799
It's your turn now, stinky.

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:03.159
Well, I suppose that even half of Snort Toss would be something.

00:15:03.159 --> 00:15:04.919
Ha, ha, ha.

00:15:04.919 --> 00:15:07.139
Think she'll ever get her memory back?

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:09.139
Of course she will.

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:11.480
This is not our idea of a suitor.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.080
His heart is aching for you, Royal Highness.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.679
Ah, let it ache.

00:15:16.679 --> 00:15:17.879
Oh, alright.

00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:19.279
I'll give him a chance.

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:21.159
Here is a question number one.

00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:23.279
What is the number we are thinking of?

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:26.000
Well of all our stupid questions!

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:46.000
We haven't all day! He's stuck in that's up there. What? What's up with his hands? It's not fair, right? The man's back at his home.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Go home.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Give me another one I want after.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.899
Oh, what a rude suitor.

00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:53.320
We are no longer in the mood for royal marriage,

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.279
Jester, at least not today.

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:57.840
A wise decision.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.360
Oh, princess of the lonely mountains?

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.240
They will be prostrate with grief,

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.360
but bid the other suitors to go home.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.000
Do not let them beg. We would not like that.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Very well, your royal highness.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Do it kindly. We wish them no pain at all.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
From this day on, we shall devote ourselves to good works and to the well-being of our people.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Oh.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
You, I didn't want to marry you anyway.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Wonder what snort maidens up to now?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Upstairs thinking. She says she'll devote her life to good works.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Works, what works?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I don't know, but she probably wants to be remembered in the history books.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
The princess who was adored by her subjects.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Oh, she's coming down.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Your royal highness, may I assist you?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Send the net to us.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
She is on an errand, your highness.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Then have someone else make soup, nourishing but not too rich.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Soup, highness?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Yes indeed, and then we shall take it to our poor subjects ourselves.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.880
What kind of soup? We don't know.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.480
We eat.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.799
We don't cook.

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:09.519
The poor will be happy with anything

00:17:09.519 --> 00:17:11.519
brought by the princess herself.

00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:12.440
Now hurry, man.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.240
Be quick about it.

00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:18.920
No, she wants some soup.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:27.000
This will be ample. The poor do not eat much. It would only make the meal.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
I don't know anyone poor around here, your majesty.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Nonsense! Greetings, Jester.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
What now?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
We're taking soup to the poor.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Made with our own wriggle fingers.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Do you know where they are, Jester?

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Your fingers?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Oh, I know.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Good!

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Wonderful!

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Take us to them now.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
They will be so grateful.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
You bet, Princess!

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
That house there!

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Oh yes! It's nice to know that the poor and my kingdom are so well off! Oh, you! Please come over here!

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Hmm? Who are you?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I'm the Princess of Lonely Mountain.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Princess?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Oh! What moment you're all highness!

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Do not keep us waiting! We have a lot to do!

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
I'm coming! I'm coming!

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Oh! I'm coming!

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
I'm coming!

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! Oh! What moment you're all highness! Do not keep us waiting! We have a lot to do!

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
I'm coming! I'm coming!

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Forgive me you're all highness! I had no idea you were...

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
My mind's smart maiden! That common name again we are princesses!

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:08.200
Handle sticks! You're not right in the head coming here bothering your elders and bettertors like this. My bettors? Oh, are you the queen then?

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.920
I am Mrs. Philly, John. Now what do you want?

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.759
You're just fulfilling our royal duty bringing soup to the poor, giving

00:19:15.759 --> 00:19:20.279
cheer to those less fortunate that ourselves? Here my good woman, now if you just

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:26.000
pour, oh there you call me poor, you who who doesn't have a stitch of clothing to your name!

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Oh, the rich aroma of the soup must have overcome you, Mrs. Philly John.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Ah!

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Eat it yourself, Your Majesty!

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Ah!

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
This is how I treason!

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Send for the guard!

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Take her to the tower!

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Oh!

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Oh!

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
We cannot see!

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
I'm afraid that serves you Oh! We cannot see!

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I'm afraid that serves you right, Snork Maiden.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Snork Maiden!

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Don't use that common name!

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Help us! We cannot see!

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Please don't steal your little highness.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Oh hold a moment!

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Oh, oh, oh!

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I think it's stuck moment.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.559
Use the handle. Oh!

00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:06.240
Stop!

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.079
You're hurting me, Bruce!

00:20:07.079 --> 00:20:07.960
I'll get it on!

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.079
Out of the way!

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.480
Ah, wait a minute.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.400
You can't break that soup, Torine.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.039
It's a family heirloom.

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:17.400
And you mustn't hit snorkemaiden on the head.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.119
You might hurt her.

00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:20.720
Stop fooling around and get this thing off, will you?

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.640
All right.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Oh, poor smart maiden. You didn't have to get up that hard.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.799
Difficult to judge it with a broom.

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:34.240
I've never hit anyone wearing a subterrain before.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.440
You will write your royal highness.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.759
Oh, forgive us, your royal highness.

00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:40.920
Sprinkle some cold water over her face.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.000
No, she'd hate that, mama.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.319
Snorkmaiden. Oh, it'd hate that, mama. Snork maiden. Oh, it's no good,

00:20:46.319 --> 00:20:50.480
woman. I don't think she'll wake up to anything but your royal highness. Your

00:20:50.480 --> 00:21:01.279
highness, your highness! Snork maiden. Oh, I'm so glad your royal highness is with us again.

00:21:01.279 --> 00:21:05.079
I hope your royal highness is not badly hurt. Oh.

00:21:05.079 --> 00:21:08.400
Where am I?

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.640
In moment, Valiya, of course, stupid.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.640
Where do you think?

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.640
That's weird.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.039
I thought movement and I had gone for a walk in the lonely mountains.

00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:18.640
Didn't we, movement?

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.640
Huh?

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.079
Do you remember who I am, Snorkmaden?

00:21:22.079 --> 00:21:23.079
Movement?

00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:24.799
What are you talking about, of course I do.

00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:26.720
And you don't think you're a princess anymore?

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.960
Princess, have you gone crazy or something?

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.160
What princess, what do you mean, Moomin?

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.039
Hooray, she's back to normal.

00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:35.240
Snorkemaiden's back to normal.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.599
Yes, it's nice to have you back again.

00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:40.000
Yes, it's wonderful. Welcome home.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.200
What is? What's wonderful?

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.000
Have you all gone loopier or something? Never mind, Snorkemaiden.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
You bumped your head, that's all.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And so Snorkemaiden's brief spell as a royal princess came to an end, except that she was the only one who didn't remember it.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:27.000
But everyone else in Woman Valley breathed a sigh of relief. release. They're always happy and always at play The movements are having fun day after day

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
The movements

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
The movements

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
They love the laughter and they love the living

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
The movements

00:22:42.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Believing and sharing and caring And giving the movements The moon is the moment.
