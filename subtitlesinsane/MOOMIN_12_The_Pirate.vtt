    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Therefore you are on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.000
They are the movements.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
They are the movements.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So come with me, give me your hand.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'll take you up to a movement land.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You can fly just like a bird.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Sing that song ever.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There were the movements.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:01:47.859
There were the movements.

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.060
He began to wonder whether his ship could withstand

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.299
the battering and buffeting of the angry waves

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.700
for much longer.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.939
Alas, it is now too late to launch the lifeboat,

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.739
he thought, as he lashed himself to the wheel.

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:02.099
His voice rose against the wind.

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:04.219
Captain Blood can think of no better death

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:05.900
than to journey to the bottom of the sea,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.500
losing the last battle against his old adversary. But if only I could see the life of the young and beautiful princess

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.500
who I rescued from the Duke Scalian before a cycle. I care not about the three chests of doubloons,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:28.039
two chests of jewels, and 36 bales of the richest and most colorful silks. But oh, must she too perish in this terrible storm?

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:29.939
Tittigood book, Mumin?

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.180
Mm, it's great.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.180
What a terrible storm, it's not easing at all.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.919
No.

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.979
I'm so glad I'm not on my own in a night like this.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.180
I feel safe in Mumin House.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.199
Oh, what was that? It sounded like a tree breaking. Hey in Mumin' House. Oh, what was that?

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.199
It sounded like a tree breaking.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Hey, Mumin'

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.500
Hmm?

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.500
Why don't you read your story out loud?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.500
Oh, okay.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500
But can I start where I got to?

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.800
As long as you tell us what's happened before,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.099
we won't know what it's about.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.099
And we might have missed something important.

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.000
Just the main points will do, Mumin'

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.800
Well, there's this bright part.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.000
Oh, it's so much fun when someone reads out loud.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Go on, woman!

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Captain Blood, and he and his men,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
have captured a rich and royal gallium.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
They've taken lots of gold, silver, and jewels and things.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And oh, yes, a princess, too.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It's exciting, isn't it?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Yes, it is.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.560
The storm that rose that night was so violent

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.280
that at first it seemed inevitable

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.199
the ship found before the waves had engulfed it.

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.680
Not bad if I say so myself.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.759
Captain Blood saw that the poor princess had indeed swooned.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.400
With only the rats for company,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.560
how frightened she must have been down in the old.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.199
The noise of the storm was deafening as the ship was thrown above under swirling sea.

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.240
The captain's brave heart went out to his young and beautiful captain.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.800
Would I have some tea, Mama?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.240
Of course, dear, would you like me to bring it up to you?

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.199
No, thanks. I've finished for the day.

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.000
That's good. Shall we all have some tea and lemonade?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Yes, please. I'm very thirsty.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
You read very well. Thank you, Moonman.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.500
Great story, isn't it?

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.000
Could I have some strawberry juice, please, Mama?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.500
Snork maiden, when is your brother coming home?

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.000
Oh, he didn't say exactly.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
But in a couple of days, I should think...

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
It was a good idea to let Snork maiden stay while he was away, wasn't it Papa?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Yes, it wouldn't be very nice to be all on your own at night in a storm like this.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Not at all. This is the... This is the... This is the... Whoa! This is the...

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
This is the...

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
This is the...

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
This is the...

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
This is the...

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
This is the...

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
She seems to be sinking.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
She won't be able to hold out much longer.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
We must get to the crew without delay.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
How could we launch a boat in this weather?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Any survivors?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
We haven't found anyone yet.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So what about further along the coast?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Any reports of survivors turning up?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
No, I'm afraid not inspector. We haven't heard anything.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Well, tell me if you do.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I'm a inspector.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Yes?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It seems to me it was a pirate ship that sunk.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
What did you say?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Well, I'm pretty sure I saw the skull and crossbones flying from the mast.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.160
And I think I caught sight of a cannon, but I could have been mistaken.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.160
You must be joking.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.480
I never joke.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.160
I can't see anything.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.959
It's too far away to make out any sort of skull and crossbones.

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:39.959
Try this.

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:41.279
Ah, you've got a telescope.

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.000
Now why didn't you let me have this before?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.120
It might have helped. Oh.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.120
Oh.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.120
Oh.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120
Oh.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.120
Oh.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.120
Oh.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.120
Oh.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.120
Oh.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.120
Oh.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120
Oh.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.120
Oh.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.120
Oh.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.120
Oh.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.120
Oh.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.120
Oh.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.879
That's it.

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:08.000
She's gone.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I suppose that there aren't many pirate ships around today. Any that are afloat must be so old that they'd probably break up easily.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
That's if it was a pirate ship, but it sure looked like one right enough.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Nothing's been washed up on the shore yet?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
No, not a thing.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Isn't it strange that I was reading that book about pirates yesterday?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
They probably wouldn't be quite so romantic in real life.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Well, in the book they were really great. I wish I'd been one.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
A pirate? Yeah, what could be more exciting?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.920
You can't mean that. Oh, yes, I do.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.839
To sail across the seven seas,

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:50.639
the holds of your ship's crown with treaders.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:52.000
But you'd have to steal the treasure

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.480
from somebody first, though, movement.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.360
Well, yes, all right, I suppose, though.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.680
But I wouldn't steal anything from anyone.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.519
Ha, then you're just a sailor.

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:08.000
Not a pirate at all.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Boomin, Mama, do you know where Moomin is? He's probably in Snuffkin's tent.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Oh, yeah?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Snork maiden.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I have a letter for you.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Here you are.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It's from the snork.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Oh, thank you.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Wait a minute, little my.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.220
I want to read Snorks letter. Take your time

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:46.000
It's snork he's coming home today, that's nice. But, Moome and Mama, there's no food in the house at all!

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.399
Now, don't worry about that, Snork Maiden.

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:52.240
I'll rustle up some dinner for us, and Snork can tell us all about his trip.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.759
Moome and Papa like that.

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:55.399
Oh, thank you, Mama.

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:57.560
Snork doesn't like missing his meals.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.000
He must have got the part sooner than he thought.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Ha!

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
That's great news!

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.759
Then he should finish his flying ship soon, hey?

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:06.000
I guess so. He should make he should finish his flying ship soon, hey? I guess so.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.500
He should make it into a pirate flying ship.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.000
I could be his first maid and no one would be able to catch us!

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.500
Nobody at all!

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.500
Ha ha ha!

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Not here.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Oh dear, I wonder where they've gone, little my.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.560
There's nobody here.

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:29.100
Moon probably wanted to go looking for an adventure.

00:08:31.899 --> 00:08:32.700
I bet they went down to the beach to see if anything's been washed out.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:35.000
At least the hangar's not been damaged.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:44.000
Let's go down to the beach. We might find a treasure chest.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:45.700
What is it?

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.000
I just thought I heard something.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.399
Where? From in there.

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:52.000
Hmm, weird.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.000
Oh, I know. The snork must have come back.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.500
Oh, yes. Snork. Of course.

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:02.200
Hello, snork.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.679
Oh, snork? Are you in here?

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.879
Mm-hmm. Ah!

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.320
Snork me!

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.519
Put her down.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.000
Oh, really? It was actually a pirate ship.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
It was indeed, Moomin Papa, and we caught the pirates when they swam ashore.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Do you think you captured all of them, Inspector?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Well, of course, we don't know exactly how many there were to begin with.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:50.120
Hmm, right. We better barricade ourselves in Moomin House just to be on the safe side. Oh dear, and I suppose I ought to stand guard over my greenhouse as well.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.440
Lace me, ma'am!

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.360
Come here, you little panicked!

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.360
Dude, let's not make it go! You'll be sore, you great big hairy folly!

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.080
No, not in your life, though, ain't just my hostage!

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.399
I needed to make good my escape, Mago.

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:07.799
Then you only have yourself to blame.

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:09.000
Hey, what?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Blame?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.799
Stay where you are now.

00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:13.200
I will not be bitten again.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.799
Keep away a little cat.

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:16.200
Well, don't hurt her then.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.399
Hurt her, you little shark.

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:20.399
She's a hostage and a cuntly one at that.

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:22.200
She'll be my safe passenger.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.200
These rough waters are perished.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.919
Well, then you better take me instead,

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:28.879
because I'm much easier to carry.

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:29.840
You, huh?

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.240
And nobody would care if I fed you slowly to the shrimps.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.480
Oh, yes, lots of people.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.120
When you overstab, win, baby.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.320
All right, all right.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.120
Hold your head, we'd blow me down.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.080
Now, what's your name, girl?

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.320
I'm Lil' Myne.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.919
Well, I'm Captain Rumpod.

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:47.000
Not going to get whatever authorities you have in this backwater.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Hurry, my patience is short!

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I'll only go if you promise that you won't hurt Snork Maiden.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Of course I will.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
If I find that you've heard her in any way at all, my revenge will be terrible.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:26.000
All right, all right, all right. Captain Rumpot, you are surrounded. Let's snork, Maiden Go. Do you hear me, Captain?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
To a gold button land lover like you never!

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
She's a good-looking wench, fair skinned and nicely rounded!

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Pirates prefer blondes.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Give me a ship and you can have her back.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
What do you say to that, my buck-hole?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
You're on your way, Captain.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
I'm going to get you a new pair of shoes.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I'm going to get you a new pair of shoes. I'm going to get you a new pair of shoes. There's Ginden nicely rounded! Pirates prefer blondes! Give me a ship and you can have her back!

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
What do you say to let my buck-hole?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
You're on your own, Captain!

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
We've got all your men! Locked up tight!

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
All me crew?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Ha, ha, ha! You're the last one!

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Now let her go immediately!

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Thank you for saving me crew! I feared they were all lost!

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Don't thank me, they're all in jail.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Ha ha, someone says that best place for a banana me.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Now let them out, I need them, and a proper ship.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Oh, with two masks and fifty cannon.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And no tricks else it'll be worse for the girl.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
This is too much.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
The school for constables didn't tell us about this.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
What shall we do, Inspector?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Police get snorkeling away from him.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
I'm afraid he'll hurt her and she'll be frightened.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
I'm trying my best, but it's very awkward all this.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I've not come across anything like it before.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.860
Oh, but it's not her fault that his ship sank Inspector?

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.000
I know, I know, oh dear, oh dear.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.659
Oh, I should have been a gardener.

00:12:51.659 --> 00:12:54.460
Hey, are you still there, you rough-earned?

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.340
Let my men go and get my ship!

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.799
Two masks and fifty cannon mines!

00:12:59.799 --> 00:13:03.440
Look, Captain Rumpod, I'm afraid that times have changed.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.399
Sailing ships don't have cannon these days.

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:07.600
Shiver me timbers!

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.200
How do you sink each other then?

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.559
I don't try to fool me.

00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:12.759
Remember, I've got the girl!

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:16.360
I think Moomin Papa has an old blender bus I'm sure you'll let you have.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.879
I don't know if it'll work though.

00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:19.120
That's all I've got.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.039
I'm one of you, Pee Brain.

00:13:21.039 --> 00:13:23.720
This is my final word, so listen well.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.840
You have two hours to get the ship ready to sail, and all my crew with her mind!

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.639
Or else I'll...

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:36.320
Now, don't worry, my pretty one. I won't harm a single hair on your head, but I must have something to threaten them with.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:45.000
Or else I'll feed her to the hungry shark! Ah! Oscar, I won't hurt you. Are you sure?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.500
Either I get my ship Oak 50 Cannon and at least two masters

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.000
she'll be food for lobsters.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
It's your choice, mehazzy!

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I should do it.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Oh!

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
He sounds as if he'll do it too.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Two hours he says the real feeder to the shark's own dear own dear.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.480
What will Snork say? Oh dear? Oh

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.200
I have a great idea sir

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.440
Why don't we climb onto the roof drill a hole and then drops up on his head? You know

00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:21.200
Constable I've always thought you were an idiot now you've proved it

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:27.799
Excuse me inspector if we set fire to the Hanna, then they'll have to come out, Mute.

00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:31.799
Shut up! Why am I surrounded by fools?

00:14:31.799 --> 00:14:33.299
This is no good.

00:14:33.299 --> 00:14:37.399
I must calm down, I must calm down.

00:14:37.399 --> 00:14:39.899
Captain Rumbot!

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:41.600
Can you hear me, Captain?

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.600
Ha-ha! You found a ship already, have you?

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.879
Well, no. There aren't any real sailing ships in Moomin Valley.

00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:50.840
The chief constable has a yacht.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.720
He doesn't usually let anyone borrow it, but I'm sure in this case he...

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.480
I want something big enough to take me to the Spanish main! I warned you!

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.120
Calm down, Captain! Calm down! Now just listen to me.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.200
You haven't done anything wrong here, no pirating or such like, so if you forget about the

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:13.960
boat, we'll let you all go, think about it, free to go anywhere you like, on foot of course.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:19.240
The fresh air, the sun on your face, no worry of shipwrecks, no storms at sea.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.399
What do you think we are?

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:24.120
Huh, we're pirates, not high-wamen!

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.519
It's not so bad being a highwayman, you know?

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:30.519
There'll be lots of rich travelers on the other side of Lonely Mountain, I'm sure,

00:15:30.519 --> 00:15:33.279
and lots of adventures with jewels and gold.

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:36.519
Daymey with flagens are rum, you chicken brain, nitwit!

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:37.720
Nitwit?

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.279
No, ninkel poop, dumb bill, uncut and runpots!

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:43.080
You're making me very angry!

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.840
If I had you on my ship, you'd dangle from the yard!

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.120
I mean, what the play?

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.720
The inspector's losing control.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.039
We had better call me down.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.919
What the clank would I?

00:15:54.919 --> 00:15:57.360
And then Mike, prison, you'd get no butter under breath

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.080
and nuggets on your biscuits!

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.080
Please calm down, Inspector.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.080
Put the bag in the fridge.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:03.879
All right.

00:16:03.879 --> 00:16:05.000
Calm down, pick it easy.dle. Let's go. Come down, Puddle. Pick the VZ.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Are you sure?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Wait, water.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I'd see through it that the bread was milled.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
That's 30 minutes gone already.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:42.000
I warned you, Goldbitten. Now there is only one hour to her painful and horrible death. Cher, up, Snark, Maiden! Try and hold on! We'll get you out!

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Water? Water?

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Huh? What did you say?

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Water, please. I'm so thirsty.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Water?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Mastik stubs too.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Hey, land lovers! Compliments to the galley! The young lady wants a drink!

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
All right, captain. I'm coming, smart maiden.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I'll take it, Inspector.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.299
It's too dangerous.

00:17:05.299 --> 00:17:07.500
You must leave it to us now, Momen.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.599
Just a minute, Inspector.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.799
I think we should let Momen go.

00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:14.099
And I've got an idea that just might work.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.099
Snuff him!

00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:17.299
It'll take an awful lot of courage,

00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:19.000
and you'll have to do it all on your own.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.400
Do you think you can do it, Momen?

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.400
Of course.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Splice me, babe, raise what's taking him so long keeping a young lady waiting.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
It's alright. I really don't mind waiting.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Tell you the truth, I could do it and drink myself.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
It's thirsty work, shun an idiot policeman.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Don't you worry, little one. They'll be here soon.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Get me a drink too, you hearin' quick about it!

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
I've brought you something to drink, Captain.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Alright, come on then. And no funny stuff.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Don't worry, I'm on my own.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Have you done a drink for me, too?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Yes, Captain.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.920
Alright, stay there and put down the train.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.599
The bigger one is for you, Captain, and the little one for Snarkmaid.

00:18:10.599 --> 00:18:12.079
Now move away.

00:18:12.079 --> 00:18:17.039
And fire it up, stay there.

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:18.039
Hmm.

00:18:18.039 --> 00:18:22.200
Why is it so red?

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.000
Well, it's strawberry juice. It's very good.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Hmm.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I'll be polite. She can drink from this one and I'll have hers.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
But Captain, there's not enough for you in the small one.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Strawberry juice isn't exactly my favorite tip of your know. No, the small one will do.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.359
Here you are young lady

00:18:47.019 --> 00:18:50.299
No, no snorkemaiden, please don't drink it

00:18:50.819 --> 00:18:54.000
Why not my young buckle. It's not poison, is it?

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:57.559
Don't be silly poison. Oh no, no

00:18:58.059 --> 00:19:00.059
Perhaps a sleeping potion

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.000
As I thought I deemed mighty strange the two cups were prepared.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
You drink it.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Oh no, no, no sir. I'm not thirsty at all.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
What's the matter, Milad?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
You said the drink wasn't poisoned, didn't you?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
So drink.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Move it!

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Ah, you're her swane, are you?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
I shall never understand women anyway.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
One of you will have to drink it and now!

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Not her, all who it all do it! Give it to me!

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
No, Mum and Don't! There's something in it! You'll be poisoned!

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
It's all right, Snorkmaten. It's nothing dangerous. Don't worry about me.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
I'll drink it!

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
That's it! Drink up again!

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.500
Down the hatch, Melad!

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.500
You're lucky and wasn't poisoned!

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.500
Yeah.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
And no sleeping potion, neither?

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:27.000
No, nothing at all. Nothing at all. And he thought he could fool me, me Captain Rumpa, but she could.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Well, I'll have the other one.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Not bad.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
No, I'm sorry, young lady. They'll have to bring you another.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Shall we order one without the draft?

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
They'll be surprised when they see me still on my pins.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.559
Why do I not sleep at all?

00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:52.559
Ha ha ha! Let's go and give my surprise, uh?

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:54.559
Oh!

00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:56.559
Oh!

00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:58.559
Oh!

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:00.559
Oh!

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:02.559
Oh!

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:04.559
Oh!

00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:05.000
Oh! Oh! Oh, wee!

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
A moment! It's all right. I'm okay, Snorkemaiden.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
There's nothing in this drink. Would you like some?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
A moment! You mean you!

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
I was pretending. So I convinced you too, huh?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
A moment!

00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:42.200
Captain Rumpot didn't wake up that day, for the next, and when he did he had a terrible headache which served him right.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.000
The inspector let all the pirates go after a week.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Well, they hadn't done any pirating in Moomin Valley,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
and wouldn't be doing any either, not without a ship.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
They love the laughter, and they love the living the movements

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000
They're always happy and always at play

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
The movements

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Believing and sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
They're always happy and goes at play

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000
The moments I've been fun day after day, the movements

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:07.000
The movements, the movements The Moons
