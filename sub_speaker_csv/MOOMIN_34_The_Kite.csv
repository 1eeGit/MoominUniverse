35000,46000,"You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,",29700,42600,"SPEAKER_10"
46000,59000,"there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.",44100,46100,"SPEAKER_10"
76000,99200,"Winter was just around the corner and that was the time of year for movement to get restless.",55600,57300,"SPEAKER_09"
99200,120400,"Because this was the time of year for Snuffkin to leave Moomin Valley on his yearly trek south.",98900,103200,"SPEAKER_00"
120400,123200,"Good morning, Papa. That bonfire looks inviting.",120200,123000,"SPEAKER_14"
123200,130400,"Now you're up already. We're buried in leaves this morning after that wind last night.",120200,123000,"SPEAKER_14"
130400,135200,"Yes, winders on the way. Oh, this is a lovely bonfire.",125500,129400,"SPEAKER_08"
135200,137200,"Yes, isn't it?",135200,136500,"SPEAKER_08"
137200,142400,"I guess we're hibernating again this winter. Are we moving, Papa?",135200,136500,"SPEAKER_08"
142400,146800,"Well, of course. We always hibernate in the winter.",138400,142000,"SPEAKER_14"
146800,152400,"If Snuffkin says I could go with him, couldn't I give this winter a miss and hibernate longer next year?",142700,146600,"SPEAKER_08"
152800,155600,"Mord. Oh, please, Moomin, Papa.",147000,152200,"SPEAKER_14"
155600,158800,"Snuffkin would rather go alone, I think, Moomin.",153700,155300,"SPEAKER_14"
158800,162000,"But I might get him to train his mind.",155800,158800,"SPEAKER_08"
162000,165200,"But Snuffkin's not really a person who likes to be pressed.",159100,161200,"SPEAKER_14"
165200,167200,"Why not?",162200,165300,"SPEAKER_08"
167200,173600,"Well, he's a very solitary person. His winter trip is the only time he can really be alone for a while.",165500,166100,"SPEAKER_14"
173600,176400,"I know, but I was just hoping.",170300,173700,"SPEAKER_08"
176400,180000,"Snuffkin likes you very much. I know that.",174000,176000,"SPEAKER_14"
180000,184000,"And I think that's why he stays in Moomin Valley for the rest of the year.",176700,179400,"SPEAKER_08"
184000,189200,"But at heart, he's a vagabond and he needs time away from us.",180100,183300,"SPEAKER_08"
189200,192400,"He's not a family man, so he's free to do as he wants.",184100,188300,"SPEAKER_08"
192400,195600,"And as his friend, you should try to understand.",192100,195000,"SPEAKER_08"
195600,199600,"I know you'd like to go with him, but I don't think it is such a good idea.",195600,198600,"SPEAKER_08"
199600,202000,"He'd really hate to turn you down, I know.",195700,196000,"SPEAKER_00"
202000,204000,"I guess.",202000,203200,"SPEAKER_14"
204000,206000,"But he'd have to.",204000,204900,"SPEAKER_08"
206000,210000,"Oh.",204000,204900,"SPEAKER_08"
220000,222000,"Oh.",209300,210500,"SPEAKER_05"
222000,224000,"Why aren't they biting?",220900,221900,"SPEAKER_06"
224000,227000,"I haven't had a proper catch for days.",222700,224100,"SPEAKER_06"
227000,230000,"Getting too cold, is that?",224600,229300,"SPEAKER_06"
232000,234000,"When are you leaving?",224600,229300,"SPEAKER_06"
234000,236000,"You're about to leave, aren't you?",233700,234100,"SPEAKER_06"
236000,238000,"Yes.",234500,236100,"SPEAKER_14"
242000,244000,"Could I ask you something?",236800,237400,"SPEAKER_06"
244000,246000,"What?",243100,244500,"SPEAKER_14"
246000,248000,"Don't go without telling me.",244900,245200,"SPEAKER_14"
248000,250000,"But why?",246300,247500,"SPEAKER_14"
250000,254000,"I'm always sad when you leave, even though I know you'll return in the spring.",248300,248900,"SPEAKER_06"
254000,257000,"Yeah. Me too, sort of.",250100,254200,"SPEAKER_14"
257000,260000,"That's why this year I'd plan to leave without saying anything.",255800,256700,"SPEAKER_06"
260000,264000,"But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly.",257500,260100,"SPEAKER_06"
264000,266000,"I'd like to wish you good luck and all that.",260500,263900,"SPEAKER_14"
266000,268000,"I miss you so much when you're away.",264300,269800,"SPEAKER_14"

270000,272000,"Moomin, I have a better idea.",264300,269800,"SPEAKER_14"
272000,274000,"I won't leave until after you've started hibernating.",271500,277700,"SPEAKER_06"
274000,276000,"Then you won't miss me, will you?",271500,277700,"SPEAKER_06"
276000,278000,"You're right.",271500,277700,"SPEAKER_06"
278000,280000,"I'll take a great idea, Snuffkin.",277700,282600,"SPEAKER_14"
280000,282000,"Then we won't really part at all, won't we?",277700,282600,"SPEAKER_14"
282000,284000,"Nope.",277700,282600,"SPEAKER_14"
284000,288000,"Because I promised to be back here in Moomin Valley before you even woken up.",283700,283800,"SPEAKER_14"
288000,292000,"Wonderful. What a super idea.",283700,283800,"SPEAKER_14"
292000,296000,"Hey, Moomin!",288100,290400,"SPEAKER_14"
296000,298000,"Oh, Snuff.",294000,295700,"SPEAKER_12"
298000,3e+05,"Moomin, come here a minute.",298000,311000,"SPEAKER_12"
3e+05,302000,"There's something funny caught up in a tree.",298000,311000,"SPEAKER_12"
302000,304000,"What do you mean, funny?",298000,311000,"SPEAKER_12"
304000,306000,"I don't know exactly. Never saw anything like it before.",298000,311000,"SPEAKER_12"
306000,310000,"Snortmain a little my-founded first, but it's too high to get it down.",298000,311000,"SPEAKER_12"
310000,314000,"Okay, I'll come have a look.",298000,311000,"SPEAKER_12"
318000,320000,"Be careful.",311000,312400,"SPEAKER_14"
322000,326000,"Be careful. What is it, Moomin?",319000,319000,"SPEAKER_05"
328000,330000,"I know what it is. It's a kite.",325300,326000,"SPEAKER_06"
330000,332000,"Oh, what?",329100,330700,"SPEAKER_06"
332000,334000,"A kite is something you fly in the sky.",331900,331900,"SPEAKER_06"
332000,334000,"A kite is something you fly in the sky.",331900,332000,"SPEAKER_05"
334000,336000,"But it has no wings.",332800,334600,"SPEAKER_06"
336000,340000,"No, you send it up against the wind on a string.",334800,336000,"SPEAKER_05"
340000,348000,"That's right!",336300,338800,"SPEAKER_06"
352000,354000,"Oh!",336300,338800,"SPEAKER_06"
360000,363000,"That's right.",336300,338800,"SPEAKER_06"
363000,370000,"Where'd it go?",336300,338800,"SPEAKER_06"
370000,373000,"Oh, through it though.",336300,338800,"SPEAKER_06"
373000,380000,"That's all right.",336300,338800,"SPEAKER_06"
380000,389000,"Oh, song, this is what a kite looks like.",374400,374500,"SPEAKER_02"
389000,391000,"Looks broken to me.",386700,389500,"SPEAKER_14"
391000,394000,"I'm sure we can fix it and make it fly.",389800,394100,"SPEAKER_14"
394000,395000,"Let's see.",389800,394100,"SPEAKER_14"
395000,396000,"Oh, no.",394700,400900,"SPEAKER_06"
396000,398000,"The string must have broken when someone was flying it",394700,400900,"SPEAKER_06"
398000,4e+05,"and the wind blew it down into the tree.",394700,400900,"SPEAKER_06"
4e+05,402000,"Well, why don't we repair it?",394700,400900,"SPEAKER_06"
402000,403000,"Yes, let's.",402000,402600,"SPEAKER_14"
403000,406000,"Looks pretty badly broken to me.",402600,402600,"SPEAKER_12"
403000,406000,"Looks pretty badly broken to me.",402600,405800,"SPEAKER_14"

406000,407000,"Well, I don't know.",402600,405800,"SPEAKER_14"
407000,411000,"We'll have to see.",406500,408500,"SPEAKER_06"
411000,413000,"It is a kite, isn't it?",406500,408500,"SPEAKER_06"
413000,415000,"Can we mend it?",412200,413300,"SPEAKER_14"
415000,418000,"Maybe.",414400,415400,"SPEAKER_14"
421000,423000,"A very odd kite.",415900,416300,"SPEAKER_06"
423000,425000,"It must have come from far away.",422700,425100,"SPEAKER_07"
425000,427000,"You think it can be repaired?",422700,425100,"SPEAKER_07"
427000,428000,"Of course.",425500,427300,"SPEAKER_14"
428000,429000,"Well, come on then.",427500,428400,"SPEAKER_07"
429000,431000,"Snork will help you repair it.",428400,431100,"SPEAKER_14"
431000,433000,"I can repair it without your help.",428400,431100,"SPEAKER_14"
433000,436000,"As long as you can find us some really long string,",431100,438800,"SPEAKER_07"
436000,439000,"strong but not too thick if possible.",431100,438800,"SPEAKER_07"
439000,441000,"I think I have what you need.",431100,438800,"SPEAKER_07"
441000,443000,"Some string.",441000,442400,"SPEAKER_07"
443000,444000,"Good. Excellent.",441000,442400,"SPEAKER_07"
444000,446000,"I'll start immediately.",443200,446400,"SPEAKER_07"

727000,729000,"That's it!",710800,713800,"SPEAKER_14"
729000,733000,"I suppose that's to stop it from spinning around, is it snorke?",728500,729300,"SPEAKER_14"

962000,963000,"That wind is strong.",961500,964900,"SPEAKER_07"
963000,965000,"It could break the line.",961500,964900,"SPEAKER_07"
967000,969000,"But that was what a friend was best streamed.",961500,964900,"SPEAKER_07"
969000,971000,"It's the knot I wore in the board knot.",967200,971600,"SPEAKER_07"
971000,976000,"The warmth between our line and the bit that was still hanging from the kite when we found it.",967200,971600,"SPEAKER_07"
977000,979000,"The knot is fine.",972100,976400,"SPEAKER_07"
