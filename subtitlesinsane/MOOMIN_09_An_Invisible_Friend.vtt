00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They are the movements.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They are the movements.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.000

This is Mum and House. It has been raining since lunchtime, and the moment and his friends spent all afternoon

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.120
in the moment house, waiting for the sun to come out.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.800
So, Tukki's arrival was very welcome.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800
Good evening, Mom.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:45.000
Tukki, come here. Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy one there. Yes, there is. You just can't see her.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Really?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Yes, I'm afraid she's very, very shy.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I'll leave the door open for you, Ninny. Come in when you're ready.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
She'll get soaked if she stays out there.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Maybe that doesn't matter very much if you're invisible.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Oh.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Too ticky. How nice. You're not that very much if you're invisible. Oh.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Too ticky. How nice.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
What is everyone looking at?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
About Nini, you know sometimes when people are very frightened, they can become invisible to the people around them.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Poor Nini, she's looked after by an aunt who doesn't like her and is really horrible to her and who only does it because she thinks it's her duty.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It wouldn't be so bad if she just got mad and yelled at her, but she's cold and sarcastic, which is much worse.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.400
She doesn't care if Minnie is unhappy,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.400
and gives her horrible jobs.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.439
What sarcastic?

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.280
Uh, let's see.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.840
Suppose you tripped and fell over.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.280
What would Mum and Mama say?

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.960
Well, she does me a fight hurt myself.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.159
Yes, well, you're lucky that Mum and Mama is so nice,

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.360
but a lot of people would be mad at you.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.500
Now, this nasty old lady would say,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.599
that may be your idea of dancing,

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.000
but try not to do it when people are eaten please.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Gosh, that's horrible.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Anyway, she just went on being more and more horrible to her,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.800
so that in the end,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.800
Nini was so upset she became invisible.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.439
On our answer, she couldn't be bothered to look after little girl she couldn't see.

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:28.759
Poor Nanny.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.399
So she asked me to do it.

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:33.959
Nanny's still outside.

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:35.399
Too nervous to come in.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.399
But what did you do to this old aunt?

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:43.319
I hope you told her she heard Nanny's feelings.

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.000
He wouldn't have done any good, not with someone like her.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So I took nanny home, and then as you're the nicest family I know,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I brought her here so you could make her visible again.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We're very flattered, of course, too, Tiki. But...

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
If anyone can do it, you and Mum and Mom again, and Mum and come play with her.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Does she talk at all to Tiki?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.079
I'm afraid not.

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:07.240
Not since she became invisible.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.399
Oh, dear.

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:10.600
I'm sure I can think of lots of games,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.279
but it'll be hard to play if I can't see her.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.800
She'll be really good at hiding seat, though.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.079
Oh, it's OK.

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:20.079
You'll know where she is because her aunt hung a little bell

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:20.839
around her neck.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.800
Oh, look, the door's opened.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.959
That'll be Nanny.

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:36.000
Come here, Nanny.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.120
It's all right.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.439
Don't be frightened.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.560
Come and meet everyone.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.199
This is your new home.

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.399
And this is Mom and Mama and Mom and Papa.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.199
They're both very nice.

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.800
Hello, I'm Mom and these are my friends.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.800
We were just having some tea. Would you like some?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.800
Oh, that is, if you can drink.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.000
Oh, perhaps I should make some lemonade.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Well, now, perhaps you'd all like to go back to the table, if you'd care to sit down and eat.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I'm sorry I don't know any more about her,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
but I'm sure that everything will be okay now she's here.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.540
I'm certain it will.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.339
We'll do our best, Tiki.

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:31.680
Here you are, Nini.

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:39.939
Well, she seems to be okay now,

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:41.959
so I better be getting along.

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:43.839
I've got a lot of things to do.

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:47.319
I'll try and come over to see how you're all going.

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:48.920
That would really be nice.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.759
Oh, it's better.

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:57.040
You have got room, haven't you?

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.279
Didn't you have someone else stand?

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:00.360
Oh, yes.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.839
The thing I mean, Bob, but it's all right.

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:06.240
They left last week. That's okay then.

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:13.279
Oh, you must have been thirsty.

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:14.720
Would you like some more?

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:27.000
Sure. Oh, are you coming up with me?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
That's nice, Nanny.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
This is your very own room.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
You'll be warm and cozy.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I'm going to get you some food.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I'm going to get you some food.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I'm going to get you some food.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I'm going to get you some food. This is your very own room.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
You'll be warm and cozy here.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I've put the lemonade on the table so you can have a drink whenever you want.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Are you sure you wouldn't like something to eat?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Ah, I see, you want to go to bed.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Well, you had a busy day, so you must be tired out.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And don't forget, if you feel frightened or lonely during the night,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
just come and wake me up and we'll have a talk.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
If you like, you can tinkle your little bell in my ear,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and that should do it, many dear.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.199
Sweet dreams. Sleep well.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.000
She asleep?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Yes.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I was wondering whether there's anything that might help her in your granny's book of household remedies.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I don't know if there's a cure for invisibility. I can't remember, but I'll have a look.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
There's a remedy for most things.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I'm a phone believer in granny's remedy.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I know you are dear. I'll go and see.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I wonder what you looked like.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.840
Hmm. Hmm. Ah, there it is.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.840
Now then, a droopy tail, evil eye, melancholy.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:35.399
Ah, this must be it. The prescription was at the end of the book and shakily written, but it looked like the

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:36.799
right one.

00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:43.399
It said, remedy for when people start getting misty and difficult to see.

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:47.000
It was very complicated. Do you think it's going to work, Mama? Granny's remedies usually do, so don't worry.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Yes, you're right.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I wonder whether we are going to get a new one.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I'm going to get a new one.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I'm going to get a new one.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I'm going to get a new one.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I'm going to get a new one.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I'm going to get a new one.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I'm going to get a new one.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I'm going to get a new one. I'm going to work, Mama? Granny's remedies usually do, so don't worry.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Yes, you're right.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I wonder whether we ought to go and wake her up.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Oh! Look, you can save many shoes.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Papa! Papa!

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Oh, good morning, little my.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Is Ninny up yet?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Yes, she's up.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I'm going to get some food.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I'm going to get some food. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop! Oh, good morning, little mind.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Is Ninny up yet?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Yeah, she is.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Where is she? She hasn't eaten yet, has she?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I don't know, and she's probably at the dining room.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Oh, no!

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Hmm? I'm too late! I'd be quiet, you two. Minnie's just finishing her breakfast.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Come on, drink it all up.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
That's good.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
It should start to work in a couple of hours.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Well done, Minnie.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Look, her shoes are floating!

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Yeah, the seal will be seeing the rest of her.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.039
Ha! I should start to work in a couple of hours. Well done, nitty. Look, her shoes are floating.

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:30.000
Yeah, the seal will be seeing the rest of her.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.799
Ha, they look silly.

00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:33.919
I think they're very nice feet.

00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:36.120
I know, Wum and Mama's remedies are good,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.320
but I can't see them working that fast.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.879
Anyway, you must look pretty bad

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:41.960
if you want to make yourself invisible.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.080
Don't let Little My Up said you, nitty.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.000
It's only the way she talks.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
She doesn't mean it.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Oh, yes I do.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I'm bored, Moomin.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Well, what shall we do then, Moomin?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I don't know.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Let's go mushroom picking.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
That's boring. I never find any.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Well, I do.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Would you like to come, nanny?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Good. And we can see who can pick the most, shall we?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
They all look the same to me, so you'll have to tell me which ones are safe to eat.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I'll tell you! Papa! Papa! Look, Papa! You can see many shoes now.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Oh, that's good. There's not many things Mama's potions won't cure.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Oh, it can't be that. She only took it a minute ago.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
It might be that it works faster if you're completely invisible.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.100
I think it's being away from that horrid ant. Yes, it might be that it works faster if you're completely invisible. I think it's being away from that horrid ant.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.799
Yes, it could be.

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:51.399
Mama, we're taking nanny mushroom picking.

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:53.899
Have a nice time.

00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:55.100
Morning!

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.100
Morning!

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:56.899
Hi!

00:12:56.899 --> 00:12:57.899
Hello.

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:12.000
Where's Nanny?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Oh!

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Huh! Wow, what a lot of mushrooms! You seem to know where to find all the best ones, Neely.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
It's not fair. I haven't gotten half as many.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
How are you doing, Momen?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Wow, that must be about four times as long as you're here. It's not fair. I haven't gotten half as many. How are you doing, Momen?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Ugh.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.480
Wow, that must be about four times as many as I've got.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.039
Uh, yeah, that's right.

00:13:54.039 --> 00:13:57.480
You've never picked that many before.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.320
You know, Momen, I think there's something fishy about this.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.000
Uh-huh. So they're not yours at all.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Well, not really, no.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Ninny's enjoyed herself.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I bet her yak-y old aunt never let her go mushroom picking.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
She was probably only allowed to carry the baskets,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the really heavy ones.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Oh, how awful for her.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.340
They're stinky.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.940
What's he up to now?

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.940
I'll take care of him.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.580
Hello, moment, long time no see.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.779
Not long enough.

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:38.580
Last time you dipped my swimming shorts in glue.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.179
You know I thought that was very funny.

00:14:41.179 --> 00:14:44.379
Hey, what's that basket floating around up there for?

00:14:44.379 --> 00:14:47.679
I don't want to be rude, but mind your own business.

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:52.360
It looks like the Hobgoblins work. Boy, just think of all the things you could do if you were invisible.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.919
Minnie, I'll carry your basket. Let's go.

00:14:55.919 --> 00:14:57.960
It stinks here.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.879
Hey, you! Isn't it me a name or just a description?

00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:05.200
What's wrong is your voice invisible, too?

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.899
Please stop it, stinky.

00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:08.899
Can't you see you're frightening her?

00:15:08.899 --> 00:15:10.700
Oh, it's a girl, is it?

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.299
Why doesn't she speak for herself?

00:15:12.299 --> 00:15:13.299
She's stupid.

00:15:13.299 --> 00:15:16.299
What a perfect name for her, Nini.

00:15:16.299 --> 00:15:18.100
Now look, stinky.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.500
Oh, yes, Moonman. Now look what?

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.299
You stop upsetting Nini or I'll get really angry.

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:27.919
Without those feet, she'd be perfect for a bank robbery.

00:15:27.919 --> 00:15:29.360
Well she's getting visible again,

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.759
so she'll be no good to you at all, Stinky.

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:35.440
You couldn't see any of her yesterday, not even the feet.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.559
Oh, oh.

00:15:36.559 --> 00:15:37.799
They're disappearing again.

00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:46.000
Oh, you have to's gone! It's all your fault, Stinky.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Yes, and like I told you before,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
she'd make a brilliant bank robber.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Don't you agree?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Perfect!

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Yeah!

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Nanny would never do such a thing as that.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And anyway, Mama's given her one of Granny's magic remedies.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:11.000
She'll soon be visible again, so they're there.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Whose basket is this? Mine in little mice.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Well, there's not many of them, but they certainly are pretty.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
There weren't many left for us to get, because Nanny has picked them all.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.919
It doesn't really matter how many you've got,

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:27.200
because you can't eat them.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.799
Let me show you.

00:16:29.799 --> 00:16:32.320
Now, this is deadly, tuffed at Toadstool.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.840
And this is Cow's Bane.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.120
You must remember what they look like.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.639
These are movements and sniff, I should think.

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:42.799
We didn't pick any poisoners ones.

00:16:42.799 --> 00:16:45.000
Not quite as many as Snork Maiden and Little My,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
but this is body flybane and insiduous pepper spunk,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and you've both got cow'sbane too, you must be more careful.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Now this is better, there's not one mushroom in here that you can't eat.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
How did Ninny manage to do this all on her own?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
What a very clever girl she is.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.880
Ninny, where are you? Come here a minute.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.000
Nini, didn't you hear? Mama wants you.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:16.799
Nini, this is a beautiful mushroom basket. We'll have a feast tonight.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.000
Her feet have come back!

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.000
Oh, I'm so glad. We, soon be able to see your face!

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
It won't take long at all, Ninny,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
and you mustn't worry about stinky one little bit.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
He's all talk!

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
If something upsets you just think of something else,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
at least that's my philosophy in life.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
If somebody upsets you,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
ignore him! That's my philosophy, Ninny!

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.059
Anyone who picks mushrooms like this deserves to be seen.

00:17:47.059 --> 00:17:49.900
You mustn't let anything frighten you when you're with us.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.200
Do you understand?

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.200
Oh!

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.200
Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.640
That's just great, nanny.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.440
Oh, that's wonderful, nanny, wonderful.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.480
I can't wait to see all of you.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.880
It won't be long now, but I don't think

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.119
Mouse Gray is quite your color, you know.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:22.000
You just sleep as long as you like, Nanny. Good night now. If you want anything, you just shout. Oh Hmm Oh, where's Mum and Mama?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Well, well, what are you doing? Do you know what time it is?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Do you like this, Moomin Papa?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Hmm.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Yes, it's very nice.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
It's good to have someone in the house to make clothes for it last.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
I hope it'll look pretty on her.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
What's this for?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Her hair. There. Good morning, Moomin, Papa. Good morning, little Mai. You're very early today.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Where's Nini?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Still in bed.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
You're a burly?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
I can't wait to see her.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Come on, man.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
I'm going to get some food.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
I'm going to get some food.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
I'm going to get some food.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
I'm going to get some food.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
I'm going to get some food.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
I'm going to get some food.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.240
I'm going to get some food. I'm't wait to see her. Come on, man.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.880
It's like waiting for Christmas, isn't it? Yeah, I like having presents every day.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.720
Isn't it, Papa?

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.960
Well, I think it's much more exciting this way.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.720
We have to wait until she's ready to come down.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.000
Did you hear that door opening? She's awake!

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:27.000
I hope she found the dress where I left it on the table. Oh, good. okay, I suppose.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Thank you all very much for everything.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Oh! Ha! So she can talk!

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
They still couldn't see Nini's face. But at least they knew that she was there,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
that she was talking to them.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
It made them all feel a lot better.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Stork made them look! They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
They're always happy and always at play.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
The movements.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
The movements.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
They love the laughter and they love the living.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:51.079
The movements. the movements We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:22:51.079 --> 00:22:54.880
They're always happy and always at play

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.480
The movements are having fun day after day

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.079
The movements

00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:12.000
The movements The moment, the moment
