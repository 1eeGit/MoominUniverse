WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.560
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with

00:20.560 --> 00:32.800
me here for you on your TV they are the movements they are the movements so come with me give me your hand

00:32.800 --> 00:41.680
I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there with the

00:41.680 --> 00:56.880
movements there was a movement there was a movement there was a movement

01:11.760 --> 01:14.240
Ba ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba threat

01:14.240 --> 01:43.680
With all the planets in outer space, there must be other forms of life different

01:43.680 --> 01:53.280
that on earth. We don't know what they look like because no one from here has ever seen them.

01:59.520 --> 02:04.480
However, we do know that they don't look like this because this is sniffed one of

02:04.480 --> 02:06.480
women's friends.

02:34.480 --> 02:53.280
So, it looks as though the rumor was right.

02:53.280 --> 02:56.480
What rumor was that?

02:56.480 --> 03:00.480
That we were about to be invaded by aliens from outer space.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.480
Oh, dear, do you mean that thing that was chasing me might have been one of them?

03:04.480 --> 03:06.480
Well, yes.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.480
I thought they were just after me.

03:08.480 --> 03:12.480
I wouldn't have thought you'd have been that important to them sniff,

03:12.480 --> 03:14.480
but I suppose you never know, knew you.

03:16.480 --> 03:24.480
It says here in this book that aliens from outer space are very civilized and peace-loving and would never want to invade us.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.480
It seemed as though they're quite happy where they are.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.480
I do, it's not a very scientific book.

03:28.480 --> 03:32.480
Well, it was definitely attacking me, Mom and Papa, I know it was.

03:32.480 --> 03:36.480
Well, it might have been a civilization from another planet sniff.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.480
They were just hungry.

03:38.480 --> 03:44.480
Huh? Well, the inspector told me that he thought we were being invaded by aliens, and he shouldn't know.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.480
I'm sure he's exaggerating.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.480
I wonder what they look like.

03:48.480 --> 03:52.480
Why don't you come and help me in the garden?

03:52.480 --> 03:54.480
You never know, we might see one.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.480
Mama, wait for me!

04:10.480 --> 04:12.480
Mama, what's that?

04:12.480 --> 04:14.480
Well, I would say it's not a vegetable, that's for sure.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.480
It looks like a flying saucer.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.480
I wonder if there are any aliens in it.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.480
They might be heard, Mama.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.480
Let's have a look.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.480
I think there's something there.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.480
This looks odd. I wonder what it is.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.480
It's a bit like a radio, isn't it?

04:46.480 --> 04:48.480
Oh yeah, an alien radio.

04:48.480 --> 04:52.480
Do you think there's anyone in there moving?

04:52.480 --> 04:56.480
Anybody there?

04:56.480 --> 04:58.480
It seems to have been deserted.

04:58.480 --> 05:02.480
There's a funny noise coming from it.

05:02.480 --> 05:06.480
Well, it doesn't look to me like it could fly again.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.480
It could be repaired.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.480
You'd need to know about flying saucers.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.480
Papa could do it?

05:12.480 --> 05:16.480
I don't think flying saucers should make that sort of noise.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.480
Do you, woman?

05:18.480 --> 05:20.480
I don't think so.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.480
But I don't know very much about them.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.480
It does seem a bit odd.

05:24.480 --> 05:28.480
As if they've said it to be blown up so that no one would be able to steal it.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.480
Because they want to keep the design a secret.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.480
Do you think it will?

05:32.480 --> 05:34.480
Oh!

05:34.480 --> 05:36.480
I'm not sure, Mama.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.480
But let's get away in case it does explode.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.480
That's why it's empty.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.480
It landed in the Asparagus patch.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.480
I'll take the radio with me.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.480
It won't be too long now, Mama.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.480
No, it won't.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.480
It won't be long.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.480
It's vanished.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.480
Less my soul.

06:04.480 --> 06:08.480
Papa's book said they could be a very advanced life form.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.480
There's nothing to show.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.480
It was ever here.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.480
Except the hole in the ground.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.480
And this radio thing.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.480
Hmm.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.480
Is it a radio, Papa?

06:26.480 --> 06:28.480
I don't know.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.480
It looks a bit like one.

06:30.480 --> 06:34.480
Let's try pressing one of these buttons.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.480
The red one first, I think.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.480
Oh!

06:52.480 --> 06:54.480
Papa, where have you gone?

06:54.480 --> 06:56.480
I'm right here.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.480
I wonder what happens if I press this one.

06:58.480 --> 07:02.480
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't see you either, dear.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.480
What?

07:06.480 --> 07:08.480
Oh, I see.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.480
So if you press the red button, you become invisible.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.480
What a fascinating machine.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.480
Papa, I think I'd rather see you, dear.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.480
Well, of course you would.

07:20.480 --> 07:24.480
Well, let's try the yellow one.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.480
Can you see me now?

07:26.480 --> 07:28.480
No, Papa.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.480
Oh, that's hard.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.480
Do you want me to try, Papa?

07:32.480 --> 07:34.480
Please, Mama.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.480
Oh, Papa.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.480
That's a very dangerous machine.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.480
I don't want to disappear ever again.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.480
It's not a nice experience.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.480
No, dear. I didn't like you vanishing like that.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.480
Well, we must put it somewhere safe, Mama,

07:46.480 --> 07:48.480
where the children can't find it.

07:48.480 --> 07:50.480
Yes, dear.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.480
Oh, Papa.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.480
That's a very dangerous machine.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.480
I don't want to disappear ever again.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.480
It's not a nice experience.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.480
No, dear. I didn't like you vanishing like that.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.480
Even forgotten.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.480
Mumon.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.480
Snortmaiden, what an earth's the matter.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.480
We found a strange creature.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.480
Strange creature.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.480
I think it's an alien.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.480
Does it look like a jellyfish?

08:14.480 --> 08:16.480
No, not at all.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.480
Little mice keeping an eye on it.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.480
C'mon!

08:20.480 --> 08:24.480
Where are you going, Mumon, Papa?

08:24.480 --> 08:26.480
Going me out.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.480
What do you mean?

08:28.480 --> 08:29.640
Moving, Mum and Papa.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.440
Going me? Oh, no, Especial.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.840
Moving, Mum, I'll hang on.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.240
I've got a few questions for you.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.640
Really, Inspector?

08:39.480 --> 08:41.400
I was told that a flying saucer

08:41.400 --> 08:42.840
had landed in your garden,

08:42.840 --> 08:45.080
but all I can see is a big hole.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.080
Where is it?

08:46.080 --> 08:47.840
What have you done with the saucer?

08:47.840 --> 08:48.920
Nothing.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.120
Well, where is it?

08:50.120 --> 08:51.960
It's not there now.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.920
It was there, but then it just vanished.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.120
Darnished?

08:56.120 --> 08:58.120
Yes, that's right.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.440
When you say vanished, you mean it flew away again?

09:01.440 --> 09:04.320
No, it just went, woof, gone.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.320
Moments are it, too.

09:06.320 --> 09:07.400
That's very odd.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.760
Yes, it was.

09:08.760 --> 09:12.040
Did you see any aliens on board by any chance?

09:12.040 --> 09:13.280
No.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.160
Are you telling me the truth?

09:15.160 --> 09:16.200
Of course.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.960
Why should I lie to you?

09:17.960 --> 09:19.560
Well, I can't.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.760
Think of any reason.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.240
I'm sorry, but it's upsetting aliens

09:23.240 --> 09:25.040
invading Moment Valley.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.120
Yes, it is.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.400
Can we go now?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.920
Certainly.

09:29.920 --> 09:32.440
Where are you all going, by the way?

09:32.440 --> 09:35.400
Oh, only to the beach to collect shells.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.000
See you, Inspector.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.640
Collecting shells, indeed, while I'm hunting for aliens.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.080
Ah, over here!

09:46.080 --> 09:48.280
Ah, Mom!

09:48.280 --> 09:49.600
Ah, Mom!

09:50.440 --> 09:51.840
Hey.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.200
Oh, Aunt Lady, where are you now?

09:54.200 --> 09:56.920
Where are you now?

09:56.920 --> 09:58.400
Where are you now?

09:58.400 --> 09:59.800
Is that an alien?

09:59.800 --> 10:02.600
It certainly is, but not like it says in the book.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.040
Have you tried talking to it?

10:04.040 --> 10:05.840
Yes, but it wouldn't answer.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.320
Let me try.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.440
Are you from outer space?

10:10.440 --> 10:11.560
G-so, what a单.

10:11.560 --> 10:12.840
Why are you acting like a dacha-dacha-dacha-dali?

10:12.840 --> 10:13.400
No-din.

10:13.400 --> 10:17.520
Yes, it's not going to happen to me a little bit.

10:17.520 --> 10:24.600
Looks like an alien child to me more like a lamp poor thing. He must be hungry. Let's take him home

10:25.000 --> 10:27.320
Yeah, well, we don't want the inspector to see him

10:48.520 --> 10:54.520
I'm sorry we can't understand you, but I'm sure you'll like me up even if you don't speak English

10:54.520 --> 10:56.520
Just try it and see

10:59.520 --> 11:01.520
I think he's missing his home

11:01.520 --> 11:07.520
Wherever in the universe that might be I wonder where his parents are he can't have come on his own

11:07.520 --> 11:09.520
He seems far too little for that

11:09.520 --> 11:11.520
Well, I don't know

11:11.520 --> 11:14.520
But he's obviously missing them and he seems very unhappy

11:14.520 --> 11:18.520
Do you think the inspector would really arrest him moving papa?

11:18.520 --> 11:21.520
Possibly, he would think it is duty

11:21.520 --> 11:24.520
Well, that would be horrible of him

11:24.520 --> 11:26.520
I know

11:29.520 --> 11:31.520
Oh, it's inspector

11:31.520 --> 11:34.520
Oh dear, he mustn't find him here

11:36.520 --> 11:38.520
And he's got stinky with him

11:38.520 --> 11:41.520
Oh, stinky? Well, that means trouble

11:41.520 --> 11:44.520
Quick, he can hide in the kitchen

11:44.520 --> 11:46.520
We gotta do something!

11:46.520 --> 11:48.520
And quickly

11:48.520 --> 11:50.520
I know what to do

11:50.520 --> 11:53.520
What mama? We'll use the machine

11:53.520 --> 11:55.520
Oh yeah

12:05.520 --> 12:10.520
We'll just keep him out of sight

12:12.520 --> 12:14.520
Now with him, this one is right

12:20.520 --> 12:22.520
Oh dear

12:22.520 --> 12:24.520
I think they're here

12:24.520 --> 12:31.520
Oh, moving papa, I heard there was an alien here with what?

12:31.520 --> 12:33.520
What's happening?

12:37.520 --> 12:39.520
What's happened to me?

12:40.520 --> 12:44.520
Oh dear, yes, how very, very strange

12:44.520 --> 12:46.520
You look like a great big goldworm

12:46.520 --> 12:50.520
An inspector in shining armor, you mean little my?

12:50.520 --> 12:52.520
That's just what I thought

12:52.520 --> 12:55.520
You'll never need a lamp to be seen, inspector

12:55.520 --> 12:58.520
I like it, criminals will be afraid of me

12:58.520 --> 13:02.520
I can't wait to get back to the station and show the constables

13:02.520 --> 13:04.520
Handy for reading in bed, too

13:04.520 --> 13:07.520
Well, duty calls, bye

13:09.520 --> 13:16.520
D-D-D-D-D- im-d-D-D-D-D-D D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D

13:17.520 --> 13:18.520
What are you doing?

13:18.520 --> 13:21.520
I didn't know that the machine was still working

13:21.520 --> 13:23.520
Or you can speak English

13:23.520 --> 13:24.520
Of course I can

13:24.520 --> 13:26.520
It's just that I need my language converted to help me translate

13:26.520 --> 13:29.520
And if you hadn't taken it from my ship and hidden it

13:29.520 --> 13:31.520
I would have been able to talk sooner

13:31.520 --> 13:33.520
That's a good way to learn, isn't it?

13:33.520 --> 13:35.520
Where are you going?

13:35.520 --> 13:37.520
To see that nice, shiny man

13:37.520 --> 13:38.520
But he'll arrest you!

13:38.520 --> 13:43.520
He came here looking for you, but he forgot about it when the machine started him glowing

13:46.120 --> 13:49.120
No, don't go there. Hey, why?

13:58.520 --> 14:00.520
What is it?

14:01.520 --> 14:02.520
What?

14:03.520 --> 14:05.520
Oh, you're so bright and beautiful, Inspector.

14:06.520 --> 14:07.520
Oh, you think so?

14:08.520 --> 14:10.520
Everyone shimmers like that, everyone.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.520
Well, that must be very nice for them.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.520
I want to pose you, please.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.520
I'm sorry, I'm too busy, but it was nice talking to you.

14:19.520 --> 14:23.520
You see, the aliens have invaded Moomin Valley and I must find them.

14:24.520 --> 14:27.520
Oh, I just remembered.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.520
I was tipped off that there was one of them in Moomin House.

14:37.520 --> 14:39.520
The inspector's coming back.

14:40.520 --> 14:41.520
What about the alien?

14:41.520 --> 14:42.520
He's running after him.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.520
Has he been handcuffed, Moomin?

14:44.520 --> 14:46.520
I don't think so.

14:52.520 --> 14:55.520
Open up in the name of the law, Moomin Papa.

14:55.520 --> 15:00.520
Well, certainly for you, Inspector. Come on in. You're very welcome.

15:01.520 --> 15:06.520
Moomin Papa, I have information from a reliable source, well, sort of reliable.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.520
That you have been harping a fugitive.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.520
I'm sorry.

15:10.520 --> 15:14.520
In other words, I believe you have been hiding an alien here.

15:14.520 --> 15:19.520
Oh, Inspector, I don't think hiding is the right word. That suggests we are trying to keep something from you.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.520
Well, Mama.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.520
Would we do that, Inspector?

15:26.520 --> 15:28.520
That stinky is tricked me again.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.520
Isn't it lucky he didn't find you?

15:32.520 --> 15:34.520
I want a nice inspector.

15:34.520 --> 15:38.520
Look, how many times must I tell you? He'll lock you up in an nasty cell.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.520
I like him. I want to see him.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.520
No, don't.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.520
Perhaps if we press the yellow button, he'll stop shining.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.520
A good idea, Papa. Be quick, Mama.

15:58.520 --> 15:59.520
The yellow button.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.520
You girls.

16:12.520 --> 16:16.520
You don't want him now that he stopped shining. Do you, little fella?

16:16.520 --> 16:17.520
No.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.520
Let's go home, then.

16:19.520 --> 16:24.520
Well, Mama, come and look. We've saved the alien.

16:24.520 --> 16:30.520
Well, Mama, the inspector's not glowing anymore. Isn't that something?

16:30.520 --> 16:32.520
Mama?

16:37.520 --> 16:39.520
Mama, where are you?

16:39.520 --> 16:41.520
I'm here.

16:41.520 --> 16:46.520
Hey, what? Where are you, Mama?

16:46.520 --> 16:48.520
Well, Mama.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.520
Right here.

16:51.520 --> 16:55.520
Mama? Oh, no. What's happened to you?

16:55.520 --> 16:58.520
I don't know. Probably that machine again.

16:58.520 --> 17:02.520
Oh, so it shrinks you as well as making you invisible, does it? Well, well.

17:02.520 --> 17:05.520
Oh, dear. I need an apron.

17:05.520 --> 17:09.520
Papa, can you get a handkerchief from my handbag?

17:09.520 --> 17:12.520
You really are quite small.

17:12.520 --> 17:15.520
That you look very cute, of course, Mama.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.520
Would you like to stay like that for a while?

17:17.520 --> 17:22.520
No, I would not. Push another button quickly before anyone sees me.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.520
Go on now. Hurry up, Papa.

17:24.520 --> 17:27.520
Yeah. Oh, dear.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.520
What's up?

17:29.520 --> 17:31.520
The machine's gone.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.520
Hey, you! Take me back!

17:37.520 --> 17:39.520
Hey!

17:39.520 --> 17:40.520
Papa!

17:40.520 --> 17:43.520
Don't worry, Mama. I'll get it back.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.520
Hey!

17:47.520 --> 17:49.520
Hey!

17:49.520 --> 17:51.520
Oh, thank you.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.520
Look at that way.

17:53.520 --> 17:57.520
Stop him, Mama. Stop him. He stole the machine.

17:57.520 --> 18:01.520
We'll get him, Papa.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.520
Hey, sniff!

18:04.520 --> 18:06.520
Don't let steam keep getting away.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.520
Right.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.520
Leave it to me.

18:15.520 --> 18:18.520
Please let me pass, sniff. I'll give you a gold stopper.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.520
A gold stopper?

18:20.520 --> 18:22.520
I mean, free. No, no. Five.

18:22.520 --> 18:26.520
No. Give me the machine, Stinky.

18:32.520 --> 18:36.520
Where is it, moment? What's happened to the machine?

18:37.520 --> 18:40.520
It's at the bottom of the river, Papa.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.520
Oh, poor Mama. Poor Mama.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.520
What's wrong with her?

18:45.520 --> 18:48.520
Well, she needs the machine to get back to normal.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.520
Normal?

18:55.520 --> 19:00.520
Well, at least this is a chance to do some really fine embroidery.

19:00.520 --> 19:04.520
Don't worry, Mama. I promise we'll look after you.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.520
It's all right, Moomin. I'll manage.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.520
I'll have to get some smaller pots and pans, though,

19:10.520 --> 19:12.520
and we'll have to have smaller helpings.

19:12.520 --> 19:15.520
But that might not be a bad idea.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.520
Oh.

19:35.520 --> 19:46.520
Here, here, my parents come for me.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.520
Mama, Papa.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.520
It's like the one we saw in the garden.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.520
Mama, Papa.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.520
Oh, my God.

20:32.520 --> 20:34.520
Oh, my God.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.520
I'm sorry.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.520
I'm sorry.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.520
I'm sorry.

20:50.520 --> 20:54.520
My parents were still thank you for looking after me.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.520
They're telling you off, aren't they?

20:57.520 --> 21:00.520
Yes, because I took a flying saucer.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.520
You ask your parents to make Mama a normal size again.

21:03.520 --> 21:06.520
Yes, of course.

21:06.520 --> 21:09.520
Fiddle grassy, grassy girl.

21:18.520 --> 21:21.520
Oh, well, that's more like it.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.520
Oh, no. Oh, dear.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.520
Oh, no. Stop. It's too much.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.520
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.520
But could you try again, please?

21:30.520 --> 21:31.520
I know.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.520
The more of Mama there is a better one.

21:33.520 --> 21:34.520
She's getting very large.

21:34.520 --> 21:35.520
Very large indeed.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.520
Oh, yeah.

21:37.520 --> 21:39.520
Oh, oh, oh.

21:54.520 --> 21:57.520
So, Mum and Valley hadn't really been invaded at all.

21:57.520 --> 22:01.520
And the movements and the friends that found out where aliens really looked like.

22:06.520 --> 22:12.520
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

22:12.520 --> 22:20.520
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:20.520 --> 22:24.520
They're always happy and always at play.

22:24.520 --> 22:27.520
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:27.520 --> 22:31.520
The movements.

22:31.520 --> 22:35.520
The movements.

22:35.520 --> 22:42.520
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

22:42.520 --> 22:50.520
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:50.520 --> 22:53.520
They're always happy and always at play.

22:53.520 --> 22:57.520
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:57.520 --> 23:00.520
The movements.

23:00.520 --> 23:04.520
The movements.

23:04.520 --> 23:10.520
The movements.
