59000,80720,"When the Hennian first told Mumen about the golden fish, Mumen thought to himself that",55700,57300,"SPEAKER_05"
80720,82720,"But it must look something like this.",75700,82700,"SPEAKER_01"
89720,93720,"My grandpa told me that his mother had actually seen it.",88400,88900,"SPEAKER_07"
93720,95720,"So you never saw it yourself, Mr. Hemion?",90100,93800,"SPEAKER_07"
95720,97720,"No, I'm a batonist.",94000,96200,"SPEAKER_10"
97720,101720,"It comes to the surface only under very special conditions.",96200,97600,"SPEAKER_07"
101720,103720,"It's very rarely seen.",98300,101400,"SPEAKER_07"
103720,104720,"Conditions?",102100,103500,"SPEAKER_07"
104720,105720,"Yes.",104000,108900,"SPEAKER_07"
105720,108720,"First of all, it must be right between summer and autumn.",104000,108900,"SPEAKER_07"

110720,111720,"Yes.",109800,114800,"SPEAKER_07"
111720,114720,"It has to be in the afternoon sunshine after heavy rain.",109800,114800,"SPEAKER_07"
114720,116720,"Yes, that does narrow it down.",114700,116700,"SPEAKER_10"
116720,118720,"And there must be no wind.",114700,116700,"SPEAKER_10"
118720,120720,"Grandpa said not even a ripple on the water.",116900,118200,"SPEAKER_07"
120720,122720,"Oh dear.",118800,121200,"SPEAKER_07"
122720,127720,"And there are some other conditions that he really didn't know about anyway to see it.",121200,122100,"SPEAKER_10"
127720,129720,"You must be extremely lucky.",122900,129100,"SPEAKER_07"
131720,132720,"Hmm.",129100,129100,"SPEAKER_00"
132720,134720,"Just getting to the lake itself isn't too easy.",131800,137000,"SPEAKER_00"

143720,146720,"Not really, because I know a shortcut movement.",140100,144200,"SPEAKER_10"
146720,148720,"I could take you there and back in one day.",144200,149100,"SPEAKER_02"

158720,159720,"Yes.",157900,159000,"SPEAKER_02"
159720,163720,"I must see that golden fish with my own eyes and maybe capture it.",159200,163500,"SPEAKER_10"
163720,165720,"It won't be easy to capture.",159200,163500,"SPEAKER_10"
165720,167720,"Why not?",164500,166000,"SPEAKER_02"
167720,170720,"From what I've heard, the golden fish is far too clever to get caught.",166600,167300,"SPEAKER_10"
170720,173720,"I know, but it would be so much fun.",168000,171300,"SPEAKER_02"
173720,174720,"You going alone?",171500,173900,"SPEAKER_10"
174720,177720,"Well, Snorkmaiden said she wanted to come along.",174100,175100,"SPEAKER_02"
177720,179720,"She gets these ideas, you know.",175100,179700,"SPEAKER_10"

180720,181720,"Uh, maybe a little my.",180700,182200,"SPEAKER_10"
181720,183720,"What about Sniff?",180700,182200,"SPEAKER_10"
183720,185720,"I think he wants to come along, too.",182200,183100,"SPEAKER_02"
185720,187720,"What about you?",183900,186100,"SPEAKER_10"
187720,190720,"In that case, we'd better go across the mountains.",186100,186800,"SPEAKER_02"
190720,192720,"Why is that? Why can't we take the shortcut?",188500,190700,"SPEAKER_02"
192720,195720,"The path is rather steep and dangerous, you know, Moomin.",191000,193200,"SPEAKER_10"
196720,198720,"Especially in the forest of witches.",193600,196100,"SPEAKER_02"

199720,200720,"Not now, maybe.",199200,201000,"SPEAKER_10"
200720,202720,"Oh, so it's safe then.",199200,201000,"SPEAKER_10"
202720,206720,"But it's a very deep forest dark and scary even in daytime.",201300,202600,"SPEAKER_10"
209720,211720,"That's okay, we'll take the shortcut.",203100,206800,"SPEAKER_02"
211720,212720,"Hmm.",209800,211600,"SPEAKER_10"
225720,227720,"Oh, dear.",212000,212300,"SPEAKER_03"
227720,229720,"Come on.",212000,212300,"SPEAKER_03"
251720,253720,"Good morning, Snuffkin.",251700,253400,"SPEAKER_09"
256720,257720,"Oh.",256300,256400,"SPEAKER_09"
266720,268720,"Sorry, Snuffkin, guess I overslept.",266500,268700,"SPEAKER_10"
268720,271720,"Snorkmaiden a little my, aren't here yet.",268700,268700,"SPEAKER_09"
271720,273720,"You're very early.",269000,271000,"SPEAKER_02"
273720,275720,"Hmm, I dreamt I caught the golden fish,",272000,272000,"SPEAKER_10"
273720,275720,"Hmm, I dreamt I caught the golden fish,",272000,277900,"SPEAKER_09"
275720,277720,"and then, of course, I couldn't go back to sleep.",272000,272000,"SPEAKER_10"
275720,277720,"and then, of course, I couldn't go back to sleep.",272000,277900,"SPEAKER_09"
277720,279720,"Well, let's go.",272000,272000,"SPEAKER_10"
277720,279720,"Well, let's go.",272000,277900,"SPEAKER_09"
279720,281720,"Shouldn't we wait for Snorkmaiden a little my?",279500,283000,"SPEAKER_09"
281720,284720,"Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?",279500,283000,"SPEAKER_09"
284720,288720,"And anyway, didn't we decide that we wouldn't wait for anybody?",283000,290400,"SPEAKER_10"
288720,290720,"So it might be better this way.",283000,290400,"SPEAKER_10"
290720,292720,"What's better this way, Moomin?",290400,291800,"SPEAKER_08"
292720,294720,"Oh, little my.",292400,293500,"SPEAKER_10"
294720,296720,"Why don't you stay here?",292400,293500,"SPEAKER_10"
296720,298720,"This will be a very tough expedition.",295700,3e+05,"SPEAKER_08"
298720,300720,"I'm tougher than you.",295700,3e+05,"SPEAKER_08"
300720,302720,"Wait for me.",300500,301900,"SPEAKER_08"
308720,310720,"Hey, walk any faster, Snuffkin.",308600,313500,"SPEAKER_08"
310720,312720,"I'm still so sleepy.",308600,313500,"SPEAKER_08"
313720,316720,"Why did we have to leave so early, Moomin?",308600,313500,"SPEAKER_08"
316720,318720,"To get there back in a day, Snorkmaiden.",314600,319500,"SPEAKER_10"
318720,320720,"But we aren't taking the shortcut, are we?",314600,319500,"SPEAKER_10"
320720,323720,"Yes, but it still might get dark before we're back.",320200,321300,"SPEAKER_10"
323720,325720,"I won't be able to walk back this fast, you know,",320200,321300,"SPEAKER_10"
325720,328720,"because my bucket will be full of water for the golden fish.",320200,321300,"SPEAKER_10"
328720,331720,"Well, don't be disappointed if you don't catch it.",320200,321300,"SPEAKER_10"
331720,333720,"But that's my whole reason for going.",329900,332200,"SPEAKER_02"
333720,336720,"But you heard what the Himmelin said, Snuff?",333000,340700,"SPEAKER_11"
336720,339720,"We'll be extremely lucky to even catch sight of the golden fish.",333000,340700,"SPEAKER_11"
339720,342720,"I heard him and now's exactly the right time.",333000,340700,"SPEAKER_11"
342720,345720,"Maybe the others made too much noise.",340900,341500,"SPEAKER_11"
345720,347720,"We'll just have to wait and see.",340900,341500,"SPEAKER_11"
347720,349720,"Don't you worry, I'll catch him all right.",346200,350100,"SPEAKER_09"
359720,362720,"Where are they going sorely in the morning?",346200,350100,"SPEAKER_09"
366720,368720,"How far is the forest of witches?",360000,362700,"SPEAKER_07"
368720,370720,"I'd say about two hours.",368000,368900,"SPEAKER_09"
370720,375720,"And can you also tell us how long from one end of the forest to the other, Snuffkin?",369500,370900,"SPEAKER_02"
375720,377720,"About the same.",371700,376200,"SPEAKER_09"
380720,382720,"Are there really such things as witches?",380500,383200,"SPEAKER_09"
382720,383720,"No.",380500,383200,"SPEAKER_09"
383720,385720,"Baby, because I'm not a bit scared of them.",383600,384000,"SPEAKER_02"
385720,386720,"Aren't you?",384100,386000,"SPEAKER_09"
386720,388720,"Not the least little bit.",386200,388700,"SPEAKER_09"
388720,389720,"There used to be some, though.",386200,388700,"SPEAKER_09"
389720,390720,"What witches?",389000,395300,"SPEAKER_02"
390720,391720,"Well, of course, sniff.",389000,395300,"SPEAKER_02"
391720,394720,"What helps do you think that they call it the forest of witches, huh?",389000,395300,"SPEAKER_02"
394720,397720,"And you're absolutely sure that there are no witches now.",389000,395300,"SPEAKER_02"
398720,400720,"I haven't heard of any coming back.",395500,398700,"SPEAKER_09"
400720,401720,"Mm-hmm.",399100,400700,"SPEAKER_02"
401720,405720,"So you're not absolutely sure that there are no witches?",401300,401900,"SPEAKER_02"
412720,415720,"Where's Moominer still in bed?",402000,402000,"SPEAKER_02"
412720,415720,"Where's Moominer still in bed?",402000,405900,"SPEAKER_09"
415720,417720,"He was off before you woke up, Papa.",415700,417900,"SPEAKER_00"
417720,418720,"Mm.",415700,417900,"SPEAKER_00"
418720,421720,"Oh, the golden fish.",418000,418900,"SPEAKER_00"
421720,423720,"Good morning, dear.",420500,421800,"SPEAKER_00"
423720,425720,"I wanted to go with him.",423500,423500,"SPEAKER_06"
423720,425720,"I wanted to go with him.",423500,423500,"SPEAKER_00"
425720,428720,"Are you writing your memoirs you're far too busy?",425700,428400,"SPEAKER_06"
428720,429720,"Mm-hmm.",428600,429100,"SPEAKER_06"
429720,432720,"That's very true with the thought of a fish that no one has seen.",429100,435100,"SPEAKER_00"
432720,435720,"That might have been a whole chapter.",429100,435100,"SPEAKER_00"
435720,437720,"Do you think they'll catch it?",429100,435100,"SPEAKER_00"
437720,440720,"No, I doubt it very much. It's highly unlikely.",437700,440600,"SPEAKER_00"
440720,442720,"In that case, you should have gone with them.",440500,442400,"SPEAKER_06"
442720,445720,"No, I do know a thing or two about fishing.",440500,442400,"SPEAKER_06"
445720,448720,"Snuffkin does, too, but he's still so young.",443000,448600,"SPEAKER_00"
448720,451720,"Oh, don't worry. I'm sure Snuffkin will manage.",448600,451400,"SPEAKER_06"
452720,455720,"Oh, this is a spooky forest.",448600,451400,"SPEAKER_06"
455720,457720,"Maybe the witch is every time.",455700,459000,"SPEAKER_08"
457720,458720,"Stop it, little lion.",455700,459000,"SPEAKER_08"
458720,461720,"Listen, everybody. Don't stray away from me.",455700,459000,"SPEAKER_08"
461720,463720,"Promise you might get lost.",459000,463500,"SPEAKER_02"

487720,489720,"Oh!",459000,463500,"SPEAKER_02"

491720,494720,"It's so dark in here.",490600,490600,"SPEAKER_09"
491720,494720,"It's so dark in here.",490600,491400,"SPEAKER_10"
494720,499720,"Sure is, and so thick the sun can't get through.",492700,497800,"SPEAKER_10"
499720,502720,"That's because of those clouds.",492700,497800,"SPEAKER_10"
505720,508720,"I can hear the wind, but we need calm.",500600,502200,"SPEAKER_02"
508720,510720,"Yes, but we also need heavy rain.",506100,506100,"SPEAKER_10"
508720,510720,"Yes, but we also need heavy rain.",506100,508500,"SPEAKER_08"
510720,513720,"You're right. That's what the Hemiellin said.",509100,510900,"SPEAKER_08"
513720,515720,"It sure looks like rain.",513700,515000,"SPEAKER_10"
515720,517720,"Not only looks like...",513700,515000,"SPEAKER_10"
519720,521720,"Oh, it's raining.",516000,517100,"SPEAKER_08"
537720,538720,"Here.",537700,539100,"SPEAKER_01"
538720,540720,"Thank you.",537700,539100,"SPEAKER_01"
543720,546720,"I gotta say, this rainstorm was very sudden.",537700,539100,"SPEAKER_01"
546720,548720,"Don't worry. It won't last that long.",543900,549300,"SPEAKER_10"
548720,549720,"How do you know that?",543900,549300,"SPEAKER_10"
549720,551720,"Vagabons do.",549700,550800,"SPEAKER_02"
551720,553720,"This rain isn't that heavy.",549700,550800,"SPEAKER_02"
553720,555720,"No, it's not bad, but we better hurryer.",551900,553500,"SPEAKER_08"
555720,559720,"We won't get to lake till noon, and that'll be too late.",553800,558400,"SPEAKER_08"
559720,562720,"I don't think we'll get very wet down here, Mum.",553800,558400,"SPEAKER_08"
562720,563720,"And so why don't we move on?",560100,563000,"SPEAKER_08"
563720,565720,"You're so excited.",563000,565300,"SPEAKER_10"
565720,567720,"What should we do with Snuffkin?",563000,565300,"SPEAKER_10"
568720,570720,"Well, we could move on, couldn't we?",568700,570300,"SPEAKER_02"
586720,590720,"We really aren't getting too wet.",577800,578900,"SPEAKER_03"
590720,592720,"We better find some shelter quickly.",588500,590700,"SPEAKER_11"
592720,594720,"But where can we shelter?",591200,593500,"SPEAKER_11"
594720,596720,"There's nothing in this wood-exec tree.",593500,596700,"SPEAKER_08"
596720,599720,"I'm gonna eat tree then, I guess.",593500,596700,"SPEAKER_08"
599720,601720,"Yeah!",597100,598600,"SPEAKER_09"
601720,603720,"What is it, Snuffkin?",601100,601600,"SPEAKER_08"
603720,605720,"There's a house over there.",602300,603600,"SPEAKER_10"
611720,613720,"It's fallen to rock and ruin.",604000,605500,"SPEAKER_03"
613720,616720,"Well, at least it'll keep the rain off.",612200,613900,"SPEAKER_10"
627720,636720,"Hello there, anyone home?",614300,616200,"SPEAKER_02"
636720,639720,"There's nobody here.",634000,636700,"SPEAKER_02"

1034720,1039720,"Maybe somebody's already caught it and you can get it in a tin.",1028700,1034900,"SPEAKER_09"
1044720,1045720,"What did you see?",1043300,1044200,"SPEAKER_07"

1060720,1064720,"Guess we better think about getting back otherwise we'll never get home before nightfall.",1051700,1051800,"SPEAKER_09"
1064720,1067720,"I don't want to get lost on a raft in the dark on this lonely lake.",1051700,1051800,"SPEAKER_09"
1067720,1070720,"Perhaps we were expecting too much.",1066400,1068700,"SPEAKER_08"
1070720,1074720,"Maybe your right's not made in, but I really thought we'd see it.",1068700,1072700,"SPEAKER_02"

1226720,1229720,"You don't really believe that is the golden fish.",1219700,1224700,"SPEAKER_09"
1232720,1234720,"It's just another stupid fish.",1230800,1230800,"SPEAKER_09"
1234720,1237720,"I can swear that it really was golden when I caught it.",1233100,1243700,"SPEAKER_09"
1237720,1240720,"It must have been the sun making it land in the water.",1233100,1243700,"SPEAKER_09"

1255720,1256720,"There he goes.",1255600,1257900,"SPEAKER_02"
1256720,1258720,"It looks so happy now.",1255600,1257900,"SPEAKER_02"
1258720,1261720,"It really was golden when I first saw it.",1258600,1261100,"SPEAKER_09"
