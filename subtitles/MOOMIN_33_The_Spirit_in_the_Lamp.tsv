120280	128640	wonderful line of course don't you agree it could be improved I think about it
131240	133720	haha
141640	145520	look at this beautiful
147320	152400	you know just usual like stuff
152400	162400	Oh! There's another big one! Can't you really find anything, moment?
162400	169400	I'll look somewhere else. I still think this is the best place!
169400	172400	Well, I'm going over there!
172400	176400	They're so beautiful!
176400	180400	Oh!
181400	183400	What are you doing, moment?
183400	185400	No, that's no shell surely.
185400	187400	No. So why did you dig it out?
187400	192400	Well, once you see it, you want to find out what it is.
192400	194400	A very odd thing, isn't it?
194400	197400	Not very interesting.
201400	203400	Oh no, I can see what it is.
203400	205400	I gave it a good wash.
205400	208400	I've seen one just like it in the fairy tales. It's an old clam.
208400	213400	Yes, you remember the story called Aladdin? He rubbed the lamp and the genie appeared.
213400	217400	The genie might appear for us if we do what Aladdin did.
217400	220400	Don't be silly, Snork Maiden.
223400	227400	But Snork Maiden, that was a fairy tale.
227400	230400	Don't laugh! I just want to make absolutely sure.
230400	236400	To tell you the truth, I've already tried it. My hands turned green. That's all that happened to me.
236400	241400	Maybe you didn't do it the right way. You can't even whip cream properly.
241400	250400	And I'm sure you have to say some magic words, such as apricot dapura, spirit, come forth, apricot dapura, try for all your words.
250400	256400	You've chosen the wrong words. You should say, come out, say some of your something.
256400	261400	Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness! Keep going, Snork Maiden!
267400	269400	Oh!
273400	277400	I am the spirit of the lamp. What is your command?
280400	283400	Goodness, did you come out of this lamp?
283400	284400	You got it.
284400	287400	So you really are the spirit of this lamp?
287400	288400	Always have been.
288400	291400	But I have the book and you're not him.
291400	295400	I can prove it if you're quite sure you want me to.
295400	298400	By all means, it probably wasn't a good picture.
298400	301400	I'm the one and only spirit of the lamp.
301400	306400	Oh, then you must have the power to make any wish come true, is that so?
306400	308400	Are we certainly but not yours?
308400	310400	But I'm the one who'll dug you out.
310400	315400	That's not so important, kid. She's the one who summoned me forth from the lamp.
315400	317400	What are we going to do about this spirit?
317400	321400	Why? Ask for something. Ask for something you've always wanted.
322400	324400	Let's see. A pearl necklace.
324400	327400	Sorry, may your wishes, my command.
328400	330400	Hey, wait a minute.
330400	335400	Oh, a pearl necklace is only one of the things I wanted I hadn't decided yet.
335400	339400	Don't worry, Snork Maiden. I guess you can always send it back.
339400	342400	If I like the necklace, then it's your turn to rub the lamp.
342400	344400	Then you can wish for whatever you've always wanted.
344400	348400	Yes. But where exactly did you rub the lamp?
348400	351400	Right here and very, very slowly.
351400	354400	All right, I'll say spirit come forth.
354400	357400	It sounds a little better than come out spirit.
372400	374400	One royal necklace, Miss.
374400	375400	Thanks.
375400	377400	This is incredible.
377400	380400	Right, I do think this is exactly what I wanted.
381400	383400	Oh, thank you ever so much.
383400	386400	All in a day's wake. So pleased to oblige, Miss.
389400	391400	Are you going back into the lamp?
391400	392400	Yes, I am.
392400	395400	I'm so happy. Now it's my turn to let you out of here.
395400	398400	I'd like to have a wish granted too, please.
398400	400400	Now, wait a minute.
400400	404400	If getting in and out is a bother, why don't you let me give you my wish right now?
405400	408400	You can't do it, young man. One at a time in the face to call.
408400	410400	Just wanted to save time.
410400	412400	Impossible, young say.
412400	413400	But why?
413400	416400	Because I am only able to fulfill one wish a week.
416400	419400	I need my rest. It's hard work, you know.
419400	422400	Oh, well, of course it's tiring.
422400	424400	Perhaps I expected too much from you.
424400	427400	Hold on. I wouldn't like you to think that I haven't got the power.
427400	430400	I can do many extraordinary things.
430400	431400	What kind of things?
431400	432400	Not telling you.
435400	442400	Listen, moment, we won't tell a soul about this lamp, all right?
442400	443400	Of course not.
443400	467400	No, names don't really matter.
467400	471400	Tulip Hydrangea, who cares?
471400	473400	No, that's not right somehow.
473400	475400	Dranium Vox Glob.
475400	477400	Oh, I'm so tired.
502400	505400	Hmm.
505400	508400	Praise the lad and I didn't tell them I can get out at night.
508400	510400	I'd have no peace at all.
510400	513400	My leisure time would be totally ruined by these two.
513400	517400	Good thing also I can read their minds so I know what I'm up against.
517400	520400	They're up to something I know they are.
531400	534400	Oh, yes, dear me, dear me.
534400	537400	No wonder the young man is worried to death.
537400	540400	She wish I better rewrite this.
540400	545400	Oh, Edgur Edgur, I do wish you was somebody else.
545400	548400	This will certainly have to be changed.
548400	550400	The whole page, really.
562400	565400	What's going on here?
565400	568400	Who did this?
568400	570400	Mum, not you surely.
570400	571400	What?
571400	574400	And some rascals have been rewriting my play.
574400	575400	Who could that possibly be?
575400	578400	Who indeed in the middle of the night while I was asleep.
578400	580400	It's very strange, isn't it, Papa?
580400	583400	It can't be you, Mum, can it?
583400	585400	Of course not, Papa.
585400	586400	I am upset.
586400	587400	Who can it be?
588400	591400	Imagine going into your study while you were fast asleep.
591400	593400	It's very rude, isn't it?
593400	596400	I find it incredible that anyone could do such a thing.
596400	601400	And all the rewriting was done on those bits that I knew weren't perfectly polished.
601400	605400	Listen, dear, I'm sure they were far too good for him to improve on.
605400	608400	No, no, you're wrong. That's the worst thing.
608400	611400	I must admit he did improve them.
611400	614400	Then I think you should feel pleased, dear.
614400	616400	No, I'm not a bit pleased.
616400	619400	The dramatist should write his own plays.
619400	621400	Looks great, Snork Maiden.
621400	623400	That is, if you like necklaces.
623400	626400	Thank you, Little Mai. It was given to me as a present.
626400	627400	Rather nice.
627400	629400	Would you mind if I tried it on for a minute?
629400	632400	Of course not. I'm sure you'll look gorgeous.
632400	636400	I suppose in time one could get to like necklaces.
636400	639400	I could ask for a similar one for you.
639400	642400	Deepers, who's your rich friend?
642400	647400	Yes, I searched the whole house, but I can't find it anywhere.
647400	649400	Someone must have stolen it.
649400	654400	Don't worry, Mrs. Philly-Johnk. I fully expect to arrest the thief any minute now.
654400	656400	Good afternoon, Inspector.
656400	657400	Hello, Snork Maiden.
657400	661400	Please hurry, Inspector. The thief has almost certainly left Moomin Valley already.
661400	665400	Oh, dear, oh, dear. Nothing is safe in this valley anymore.
665400	667400	Now calm down, Mrs. Philly-Johnk.
667400	670400	Did you just say you've had something stolen, Mrs. Philly-Johnk?
670400	674400	My pearl necklace. Extraordinary beautiful pearls.
674400	678400	87 of them. Looks just like the one you're wearing, Little Mai.
678400	680400	You stole it.
682400	683400	Did you?
683400	685400	Oh, oh, no!
685400	686400	What are you doing?
686400	687400	What are you doing?
687400	688400	Stop!
688400	689400	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
689400	690400	Rest your heart.
690400	692400	Prove the river she's a baby. She's innocent.
692400	694400	Little via the ocean.
694400	697400	The smallest cruxer up in the most funny adventure.
698400	701400	This is Snork Maiden's necklace, you know.
701400	703400	Oh, that's very funny.
703400	706400	Is that the best explanation you can think of?
706400	709400	No one calls Little Mai a thief and gets away with it.
709400	712400	Is it really true that this is your necklace, Snork Maiden?
712400	715400	Of course, Inspector. It was a present. I swear it.
715400	717400	Who gave it to you?
717400	719400	That's a secret between me and Moomin.
719400	720400	A secret?
720400	723400	That's a lie. They stole it, Inspector.
723400	726400	I've never known them to lie before, Mrs. Philly-Johnk.
726400	728400	You're back from a very bad background.
728400	729400	You should see their home.
729400	730400	So right!
730400	731400	No, I see it.
731400	733400	Stop it, Little Mai!
733400	735400	Bad background and you talk to them.
735400	736400	There you say that.
736400	738400	No, there's something I want to ask you.
738400	740400	Little Mai, what are you doing?
740400	741400	No!
741400	743400	The boy has to be a pain, you know.
751400	753400	This is it.
757400	759400	I love to know who did this.
759400	762400	He's certainly got an act with words.
763400	764400	Huh?
764400	767400	Listen to this. This is a good example.
767400	771400	Hey, look at the sky. The sun's up and there's Gracie.
771400	774400	That's not great. Sounds very ordinary.
774400	776400	That's what I wrote, Snorkin.
776400	778400	Oh, I'm so sorry.
778400	781400	That's all right. Now listen to how he rewrote it.
782400	786400	But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
786400	789400	It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
789400	792400	Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon
792400	795400	who is already sick and pale with grief.
795400	797400	What a sunrise!
797400	802400	And note how clever this writer is to change her name from Gracie to Juliet.
802400	806400	Gracie's worried because her parents don't approve of her love Edgar.
806400	808400	I had his names don't matter.
808400	810400	Tulip, I'd rangers who cares.
810400	812400	But listen to this.
812400	813400	What's in a name?
813400	817400	That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.
817400	819400	It's much more romantic.
819400	820400	I got it.
820400	821400	So Romeo would.
821400	823400	Well, he not Romeo called.
823400	824400	Oh, it's simply great.
824400	827400	Except maybe I wouldn't have mentioned his smell.
827400	831400	Don't you agree? He's an excellent playwright.
831400	832400	Yes, I agree.
832400	834400	He sounds like a very promising playwright.
834400	837400	And then wordy perhaps, but really good.
837400	839400	Very good indeed.
839400	841400	Write him a note asking him to carry on.
841400	843400	And there might not be necessary.
843400	846400	You know, all the changes were made in the middle of the night
846400	847400	while I was fast asleep.
847400	849400	And usually writers are in their beds,
849400	852400	none of their desks when they're asleep.
852400	856400	Well, yes, that's the only time you're not at your desk, isn't it?
856400	859400	But there are people you know who walk about at night
859400	862400	without remembering about it the next morning.
862400	864400	Sleepwalkers, you mean?
864400	865400	Now I come to think of it.
865400	868400	You were rather sleepy when you woke up this morning.
868400	871400	You're right, Mum and Mama, even sleepier than usual.
871400	872400	Just so.
872400	874400	You mean you yourself got up at night
874400	877400	and then went and rewrote the play and you're asleep?
877400	879400	Well, yes.
879400	883400	I have been worried about some minor things in my play.
883400	887400	So my subconsciousness, fairly rich and literary talent,
887400	889400	as we all know, comes to the rescue.
889400	890400	A moment, Papa.
890400	893400	And in my sleep, my imagination runs riot.
893400	896400	I have all sorts of good ideas that make me grab a pen
896400	899400	in the middle of the night and rush to my room
899400	901400	to let the real skill throw.
903400	904400	I got it!
904400	905400	I got it!
905400	906400	I got it!
906400	908400	With this I can have anything!
908400	910400	I can do anything!
910400	911400	Stop!
911400	912400	Stop!
912400	914400	When I say stop, you have to stop!
914400	916400	The inspector!
916400	919400	How can you put on the already?
920400	922400	And we've arrived when you want to get lost!
922400	924400	Get lost yourself!
924400	925400	I don't have time for you!
925400	927400	The inspector's chasing me!
927400	928400	What?
928400	929400	You?
929400	930400	Stop, little boy!
930400	931400	I'm the inspector!
931400	932400	You have to stop when I say so!
932400	934400	He's not chasing me, huh?
934400	935400	Don't deny it!
935400	936400	I know why you're running!
936400	937400	You stole that thing, didn't you?
937400	939400	I know it, too!
939400	941400	That's gonna be your business!
941400	942400	It's not yours!
942400	944400	But it must be somebody!
944400	946400	So I'm making my business in it to me!
947400	948400	Oh, is that me?
948400	949400	Please!
949400	950400	Stop loosening everything!
950400	952400	Give it back to me!
952400	955400	Hey, that looks like the lamp we found!
957400	958400	Chase him!
958400	959400	It's better not be!
959400	960400	Hello!
961400	962400	Oh, man!
962400	964400	Stinky's got our magic lamp!
964400	965400	Let after him!
965400	966400	Yes!
966400	967400	We can't let him get away with it!
967400	968400	Or terrible!
968400	969400	Please let it happen!
969400	970400	Did you hear that?
970400	971400	That's enough here, no!
971400	973400	He said magic lamp or something!
973400	975400	After him!
975400	977400	The magic lamp is mine!
977400	978400	Just leave me alone!
978400	980400	Where are you going, Stinky?
980400	981400	Help me get the necklace!
981400	983400	No, no, no, no!
983400	984400	This way!
984400	985400	He's got me!
985400	986400	Oh!
986400	987400	Get him!
987400	988400	Get him!
988400	989400	He's got me!
989400	990400	Oh, man!
990400	991400	Get him!
991400	992400	Get him, man!
992400	993400	Give him!
993400	994400	Oh!
994400	995400	Oh, my dear!
995400	996400	He's coming!
996400	997400	He's coming!
1003400	1004400	Oh!
1005400	1007400	You're the spirit of the lamp, aren't you?
1007400	1008400	Yes, my master.
1008400	1010400	What is your wish?
1010400	1011400	You his master?
1011400	1012400	Yes, me!
1012400	1014400	I'm the master.
1014400	1016400	I let him out, so he'll do what I say.
1016400	1018400	I don't believe a word of this.
1018400	1020400	Fairy tales aren't true.
1020400	1022400	Maybe it isn't true, but it works.
1022400	1025400	I saw Snorkmaiden wishing for a pearl necklace
1025400	1027400	and her wish was granted.
1027400	1028400	Uh-huh.
1028400	1030400	So you're responsible.
1030400	1032400	Yeah, and I brought it right away.
1033400	1035400	God, now let me see.
1035400	1038400	What do I want more than anything in the world?
1038400	1041400	Stinky, he can only make one wish a week come true.
1041400	1043400	You'll have to wait your turn.
1043400	1045400	No, that's very unfair.
1045400	1047400	Let's get back to the necklace.
1047400	1049400	Where did you steal it from, mister?
1049400	1050400	I don't steal.
1050400	1052400	Well, then tell me where you found it.
1052400	1054400	Around here somewhere.
1054400	1056400	Mrs. Philly John's house, baby.
1056400	1058400	I don't know who lives there.
1058400	1060400	Oh, then you did steal the necklace.
1060400	1063400	Well, that's a lot easier, you know.
1063400	1065400	How about a magic key that can open anything,
1065400	1067400	bolts and safes and stuff, huh?
1067400	1070400	Listen, there's something I'd like to ask you.
1070400	1072400	A sack of gold wouldn't be half as much fun
1072400	1074400	as a key that opens anything.
1074400	1078400	Tell me, is it possible that you rewrote women poppers play?
1078400	1080400	Yes, I did. It was really awful.
1080400	1083400	Oh, come on, now I just needed some polishing.
1083400	1086400	And what's more, see this young man standing here?
1086400	1089400	Well, he was really worried about your play, you know?
1089400	1091400	I was just trying to help.
1091400	1092400	Is this true?
1092400	1095400	Yeah, safer than mercury, of course.
1095400	1098400	But then there's professional pride to think of.
1098400	1100400	I can explain, Papa.
1100400	1102400	I saw you weren't happy about your play
1102400	1104400	and I wanted it to be a big success.
1104400	1107400	Of course, I didn't want the spirit to write it himself.
1107400	1110400	I'm going to take the key, yeah!
1110400	1112400	I've just realized, everybody,
1112400	1114400	the spirit didn't write all that himself.
1114400	1115400	I've heard it before.
1115400	1117400	I thought it sounded familiar.
1117400	1119400	Is that so?
1119400	1122400	Yes, he stole it from a play by somebody else.
1122400	1125400	This spirit is a cheat and a liar.
1125400	1127400	Oh, dear me.
1127400	1129400	Well, I can't help being so well read.
1129400	1131400	Can I go back in the lamp now?
1131400	1133400	No! Wait! Don't go yet!
1133400	1135400	I want next week's list now!
1135400	1137400	Sorry, Mastic Interblind.
1137400	1139400	Have them put into an impossible situation.
1139400	1141400	See you next week!
1144400	1146400	But that's ridiculous!
1146400	1149400	Not next week, nor next month, or even next year.
1149400	1151400	Stinky, this lamp is not yours.
1151400	1154400	Besides, I know exactly the sort of thing you'd ask for.
1154400	1156400	A master key or something.
1156400	1160400	You think you can hide that magic lamp from me, do you?
1160400	1163400	Well, there's no hiding place good enough for that.
1163400	1165400	Hmm.
1165400	1170400	Well, then I really do think that lamp is a bit too dangerous to have a rod.
1170400	1172400	Hmm. I think you're right.
1172400	1175400	Snuff candy, you have any good ideas for us?
1175400	1177400	Yes, for us.
1189400	1192400	Hmm. The week has passed, so we can summon the spirit again.
1201400	1203400	There's the inspector!
1206400	1209400	You do it, Snuffkin!
1209400	1211400	Call the spirit!
1219400	1222400	Oh, no, not again. What do you want this time?
1222400	1224400	Can you bring the hobgoblin here?
1224400	1228400	I suppose so. I'll be back as soon as I can.
1236400	1239400	But why on earth do you want the hobgoblin?
1239400	1244400	As far as I can see, there's only one safe place for the lamp where no one can find it.
1244400	1249400	And that's on another planet, and the only one who can put it there is the hobgoblin.
1249400	1251400	He's coming any minute.
1251400	1253400	Geez, that guy ever hard to find.
1253400	1256400	Thank you. I've done my wake for this week.
1256400	1259400	See you next week. Goodbye!
1265400	1283400	And some of the hobgoblin took the magic ramp away and hid it on some unknown planet.
1283400	1290400	And a good thing too, it would really be very boring if all your wishes were granted, wouldn't it?
1291400	1300400	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1300400	1307400	We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1307400	1311400	They're always happy and goes at play.
1311400	1318400	The Moons are having fun day after day. The Moons.
1318400	1322400	The Moons.
1322400	1329400	The Moons.
