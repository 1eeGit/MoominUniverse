    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Therefore you are on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
They are the movements. I'll take you up to a moment land. You can fly just like a bird.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Sing that song ever.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There were the moments.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
There were the moments.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
There were the moments.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There were the moments.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Wait a minute. Who's this?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Wait for me, movement!

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Mama! Mama! Are they ready?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Are what ready?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.200
The pancakes!

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.199
Not yet. This hobgoblin wood doesn't seem to burn very well.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:09.699
Aren't they cooking?

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.199
They won't be long. Have some lemonade while you're waiting.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.400
Mama! Are the pancakes ready yet?

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.000
Oh well. Everything seems normal in the movement house.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.500
Oh!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.400
I'm a dumb boy. I'm a no-good-meagaboo mini.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.000
No, you're not, Snork. You're very clever.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
No, I'm a failure of floppy frightful fraud and a misfit.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
But your land ship was a success? Wasn't it?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Kid stuff!

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Look, if you can make a ship that runs on land,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
then I'm sure you can make one that flies, I believe in you.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Fatal out of good, that does me snort and maiden.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.159
You know, last night I thought I'd done it, a flagship,

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.759
then I looked at it again.

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:56.280
No good, no good.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.439
It was all wrong.

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.719
Wouldn't, couldn't fly at all.

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.199
Or how could someone so intelligent be such an idiot?

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.039
Oh dear, oh dear.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.699
Well, they're ready.

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:11.580
Go and tell the others little Mai.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.659
All right, Moomin, Mama.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.020
Where's Moomin and Snork Maiden?

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.699
Snork Maiden's fallen again.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.819
Come on, Snork Maiden, cheer up.

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.580
I'm sure Snork will get over it.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.719
Inventors always feel down in the dumps when something doesn't work.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.719
Does Moomin Papa do you think?

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.479
He invents stories, doesn't he, Moomin?

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.199
Well, where Moomin was really?

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.840
Snork Maiden, do you want some pancakes?

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.199
Oh, yes, please, Moomin Mama.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.000
Moomin, go and get Papa.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.800
I have a feeling he's writing his gut stuck again.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.000
OK, Mama.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Now, what's the matter, Snork Maiden?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
The sun returned to the eastern sky when morning came

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and everything started to get lighter and louder.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Dear, everybody knows that, even the stupidest retard, really.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I have absolutely no literary talent. I'm an ignorant, Miss Son a literate, dilettant, nor an illiterate idiot.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It's high time I gave up writing, though.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Yes?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Papa?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
What is it, moment?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Uh, Mama said to tell you the pancakes are ready.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Well, I can't stop now.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I'm being creative.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I'll eat later.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.500
Oh, really? Yes. Anything else? Uh, Mama said to tell you the pancakes are ready. Well, I can't stop now. I'm being creative. I'll eat later.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.000
Oh, really?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Yes, anything else?

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.500
Yeah. No. I thought you said something.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.000
Mom in! Wait. I'm going out.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I'm coming!

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
No, you can't.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Snuffkin and I are going on an adventure, and it could be dangerous.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Hi, Snuffkin!

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Hello, Moome.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Hello, Moome.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Hello, Moome.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Hello, Moome.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.240
Hello, Moome. Hello, Moome. Hello, Moome. Hello, Moome. Hello, Moome. and it could be dangerous.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.199
Nice, Nuffkin!

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.000
Hello, Moomin. Didn't think you were coming. Sorry, I'm late. What's that?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.079
A leaf boat. Look, it sails on the river just like a real one.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.680
I bet it goes all the way down to the sea,

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.800
and maybe even to some foreign lands.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.519
Gosh, Nuffkin, I'd like to do that one day.

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:29.279
Let's go then, shall we?

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:33.920
Little my wanted to come, but I told her it was too dangerous.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.040
Hmm, perhaps that wasn't the best thing to say.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.040
Look!

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.040
Where are you?

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.040
Where are you?

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.040
I brought these two of them on.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.040
I thought they could use a bit of fun.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.000
Wait, woman!

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Are we really gonna climb up there?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Look, I don't think we can all go. It'll just be moving in me.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I'm not climbing up there. Well, I am.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Wouldn't you like to keep me company instead?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.100
Look, there's a cave just a little bit further along this path.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.399
Why don't you two girls wait for a sec? We won't be long.

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:13.899
But if you can walk to it, why on earth climb to it?

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:16.300
Ah, difficult for a girl to understand.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.300
Well, I think boys are difficult to understand.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.300
We're not sure we can reach it from above.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.300
Well, we'll soon find out.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.439
Are you coming with us, Sniff? Oh, I think I'll guard the rear. Protect the it from above. Well, we'll soon find out. Are you coming with us, Sniff?

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:27.639
Oh, I think I'll guard the rear.

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.720
Protect the cave from below.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.240
Oh, yeah.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.000
Well, someone has to look after the girls.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:07:01.800
Someone responsible. Oh my goodness, it's dark in there. Let's go in then. I don't like the look of it.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.519
We'd better stay out here. You never know who might live in there.

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:06.600
Don't be silly.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.319
No one lives in there.

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.600
That's what I don't like.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.920
Yes, exactly a place with no one living in it is really scary.

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:20.480
I think we must be right above the cave here.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.439
Maybe.

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:23.360
I can't find a hole, though.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.000
Let's look a bit more over that way moving

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:30.920
Wow, I never seen a shell like this before

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:37.120
Look at that one they must be worth a fortune come over here and look little mind

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:46.060
Where's little my eyes Nork made and she went into the Sniff. Oh, no, she can't do that.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.300
It might be dangerous.

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:53.699
Little my, little my, come out.

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:56.100
No, you come in, scaredy cat.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.860
You can't just go in like that.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.300
You can't.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.899
So tell me, how would you go in then, Mr. No, at all?

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.259
Stay where you are.

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:05.699
We'll rescue you.

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:09.000
Uh, you're coming too, aren't you, Snork Maiden?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
You can't stay here alone.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.800
I suppose so.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.300
Right then, let's go.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.800
Uh, shall I hold your hand in case you get frightened?

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.199
Little Mai! Where are you?

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:46.000
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Stop it, please! You're frightening Snork Maiden! Little Miiiight! Where are you? I can hear something. Me too. Perhaps it's the wind.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
No, Snork Maiden. It sounds like someone moaning.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
You get scared me like that. No one lives here.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Who want to live here anyway? It's dark and cold.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
It's moment and snuffkin.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
They've climbed out and we can hear their voices in the distance.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So we needn't worry. Why would they be moaning?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.500
No, it's not them.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.600
I'm gonna go and investigate.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.100
Don't little like, please, please stop it.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Pull hard, Moomin. Will this do?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Right, who's going first?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Me.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Okay, but please be careful.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:10:05.000
I will. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Newman? Yes, of course! Ooh!

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Ah!

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Ah!

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Ah!

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Ah!

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Ah!

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Ah!

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Ah!

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Ah!

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Ah!

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Ah!

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Ah!

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Help!

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Help me!

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Moment! What's happened? Talk to me!

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Moment! Are you alright?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Oh, I don't know. I think so. My bottom's a little bit sore though.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I'm sure I heard somebody scream just now.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Well, the Himmulin was down here having a nap.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.960
The Himmulin? If this is another of your games, woman, I don't like it.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.320
Mr. Himmulan, we were climbing down from the top.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.840
We didn't know you were asleep.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.000
That's not quite right.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.120
I wasn't asleep.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.200
I wasn't at all comfortable, you know.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.360
Well, what were you doing here then?

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.840
Well, to tell you the truth,

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.360
I really haven't been quite myself lately.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.960
You haven't lost any more rare stamps, have you, Mr. Himmulan?

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:11.000
Unaccontrary, Roman. I have them all. Even the rarest, every single one.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Then what's wrong? That's good, isn't it? I mean, my collection is complete.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And no one in the world has a better stamp collection than you have, Mr. Himulin?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
No, of course not mine is perfect.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.919
There isn't a stamp I haven't got.

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:30.799
Rare ones, old ones, misprinted ones, I have them all.

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:32.399
I still don't understand.

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:35.200
There's no challenge, nothing to search for.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.799
You're too young and you don't collect stamps.

00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:39.799
Oh dear, me, dear me.

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:42.000
I'm beginning to understand.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.600
Hmm?

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.000
He's not a collector anymore.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
He's got all the stamps he could ever want.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
That's the trouble.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
It's not half as much fun.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
That's why you're sad, isn't it, Mr. Hemmungen?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Yes, it is. No fun.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
No fun at all.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Now I understand.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I can see why you're upset.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And me falling on top of you like that didn't really help, did it?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Not exactly, Moomin.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Look who was taking a nap in the cave.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Oh, it's you, Mr. Amulin.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So it must have been his snoring that we heard.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
What a noise he was making.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
I'd never ever snore.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:46.000
You certainly do! Yeah, always! Sit it! Sit it!

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Sit it!

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Sit it!

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Sit it!

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Sit it!

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Sit it!

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Sit it!

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Sit it!

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Sit it!

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Sit it!

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.960
Sit it! Sit it! But you know you can't always tell. The keel doesn't look too good. Yes, we could take it out to see a no-time. The sales got holes in it.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.639
Hey, I can't find any owners.

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:13.399
You can paddle all-steer.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.240
Look out, friends. It's going over!

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.440
Hey!

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Hang on, everybody.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
I've lost my confidence and it makes me feel very unhappy. Well, it can happen to anyone, you know.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Even to you?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Well, not much, of course.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Lucky you. I just don't know what to do.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.539
How can I get it back? There must be a way.

00:13:47.539 --> 00:13:53.299
It's hard to say. Everybody's different, but with me it just happens.

00:13:57.539 --> 00:14:00.340
I don't think I'll ever invent anything again.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.779
Perhaps I'll have a break from my memoirs too.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Tea time? Oh dear, what's the matter with you, Choo?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
You look a bit down in the dumps.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
You know I might have been a bit overconfident.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Me too, I think.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Oh.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Oh, hey there!

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Mum and mama!

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Mum and papa!

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
There's no need to yell. We can hear you, watch the matter sniff.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
We found a boat on the beach, come and have a look!

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
A shipwreck washed up on the shore.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
It's not a wreck and it's got a white sail.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Oh-ho.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
We're gonna repair it and then it'll be ours.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
All right, I'm coming.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Come on, snork, let's take a look at this boat.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.039
It could be just the thing that cheer us both up.

00:14:48.039 --> 00:14:49.879
So it's got a sail.

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:51.679
A white sail, you say.

00:14:51.679 --> 00:14:53.320
That could be extremely interesting.

00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:59.120
It's a sturdy little craft.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.440
It's nicely built.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.200
Well designed.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.279
She's a bounding.

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:05.000
So does that mean we can keep her?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
It seems to be in pretty good condition except for the hole in the bottom.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
You know, maybe that's why she was abandoned here.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
You could be right, Southkin.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Finder's keepers, you guys. Of course it makes it our boat.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.840
It'd have to wait to see if anyone claims it first little mine. What shall we do then Papa?

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:35.000
Well first things first we must prepare the hole and then tire up securely in case there's a storm

00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:41.600
Absolutely then if the owner comes we are to give her back to him

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.200
Mind you might know she's here.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.840
So what are we gonna do when we've repaired her?

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.440
It's bad for boats not to be yours,

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.840
but we could sail the seven seas.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.039
Woo!

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:58.039
We need no power, Big Sheen.

00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:02.639
I'd be happy just to explore around here.

00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:04.039
Don't worry, Snork Maiden.

00:16:04.039 --> 00:16:07.120
If we get big waves, we can sail between them, isn't that right?

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.960
Mom and Papa!

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.639
Well, in a way.

00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:14.159
No, come on, let's get to work.

00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:16.399
How about you, Snork? Will you help us?

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:17.960
Yes, of course.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.679
Can I do anything for you, Mom and Papa?

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:23.080
Yes, if you'd like to, Mr. Hemmulon.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.000
Well, I'm afraid I'm not much of a builder, but if there is something I could do.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Well, let's get her out of the water first, shall we?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Yeah, mom!

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Let's do it!

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And we'll need some big logs to go under her.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
I think tin should be enough.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I'll be sure.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Let's go, Prime!

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Yes, you'll need to be safe to work on,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.299
so we'll want something strong to keep her upright as well.

00:16:47.299 --> 00:16:49.799
And lots of tools.

00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:51.500
I'll go home and get some,

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.000
and I think we'll need a bucket and a shovel.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I'll come with you, help you, tools.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.500
Yes, you go.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:27.000
I'll stay and keep guard in case the owner comes back. Sleep well.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Man, the top sales.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000
What?

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Are they all in bed, my dear? Yes, dear, sleeping like logs. I'm not surprised. They all work very, very hard today.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
I can't wait until the boat's ready and we can sail off somewhere.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
My dear, we'll go anywhere in the world you like.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Anywhere at all you've only got to say and off will jolly will go.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
It doesn't have to be far, dear.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.440
Let's get to bed too. We've got an early stay. the world you like. Anywhere at all you've only got to say and off will Jolly will go.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:10.240
It doesn't have to be far dear. Let's get to bed too. We've got an early start

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:15.920
at the morning. Oh, intellect was like me, aren't used to this hard work.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:21.839
Oh, I'm tired out and I can hardly move. Mama, I better put these tired legs to bed.

00:18:21.839 --> 00:18:25.960
Good night dear Moomin Papa. This will be good for him, I think.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.559
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

00:18:34.519 --> 00:18:36.480
A perfect fit if I may sit, so. Yeah, well now for the rest of her.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.480
Right.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Look at me, Mum, I'm doing the Tari. I know, little Mai. I'm only doing where you can't reach.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Oh, alright then. Sniff you lazy land lever. Bring me some more Tari.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
No, I won't. Get it yourself, you lazy thing. You wanted to do it.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.160
I didn't want to carry Tari though anyway I'm the painter come on hurry up

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Mom and mama try cat it all out. Yes, please nook me Hey, feeling all right, Mr. Hemmielin?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Yes, thank you.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
You're fixing the boat very quickly.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Yeah, we sure are.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I should be finished very soon.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Yes, I'm sure it will.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
That's what I was afraid of.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
What shall I do then, Snuffkin?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Well, maybe you can start collecting something else.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
What do you think?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I'm sure it will.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
I'm sure it will.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.500
That's what I was afraid of. What shall I do then, Snuffkin.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.000
Well, maybe you could start collecting something else. What you think?

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Something else, like what?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Well, I don't know.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Anything, really? How about butterflies?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
No, my second cousin does that, and he's a complete idiot.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
It has to be something interesting. Ornumans?

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Ornumans?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Yeah, you could collect those forever.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.099
Not scientific.

00:20:07.099 --> 00:20:11.099
Well, it's up to you, but I think you really ought to collect something, Mr. Hemmielin.

00:20:14.599 --> 00:20:16.099
Uhhh...

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.700
Mama!

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.500
Mama!

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:24.099
Mama, quick hurry up!

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:26.000
We're gonna launch the new boat!

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Alright, wait for me, I'm coming!

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
The sail you men at is perfect, Mom! Come on!

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Are you ready, everybody? I'll count to three, then push as hard as you can!

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:46.000
One, two, three! Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, my God!

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Oh, my God!

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Oh!

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Oh!

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Oh!

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Oh!

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Oh!

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And so, with their new boat, finally repaired and uncleaned,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.920
Moomin and the others began to get very excited about their trip from the world.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.319
Even Snork and Mr. Hemmulin were in unusually high spirits.

00:21:10.319 --> 00:21:12.920
All aboard for a trial run!

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.359
I've decided what I'm going to collect.

00:21:19.359 --> 00:21:22.039
Flowers, look, here's my first sample.

00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:25.000
It's a sweet fryer. Rosa Robiganosa.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
That's great. Good for you.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Snork maiden, I've just had a new idea for my flying ship. I'm certain it'll work this time.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Of course it will, Snork. Good luck.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I better get on. Right, start paddling everyone.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
We'll be back soon, my dear, moment mama.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Take as long as you like, Papa.
