351520	356400	where have you been snuffkin that's a big secret movement I won't tell anyone
356400	360080	All right, it's the magic hat. It's on a sandbank further down the river.
360080	361120	Gosh!
361120	363120	But something terrible is happening.
363120	364720	What? What is it?
369360	372560	Oh dear, perhaps we shouldn't have thrown it in the river.
373600	375840	It's too late now. Let's get there cooking.
375840	389760	There it is. It's caught on a branch in the middle.
391280	396320	Where? Oh, Smoughkin, I can see it. Look at the water. It's all red.
396800	400400	Hmm, seems to be coming from the hat. I wonder what it is, Moong.
400400	402800	I'll go and get it. Be careful.
402800	407600	Shall I come too? No, you stay there.
414560	415760	Have you got it? Uh-huh.
432800	439280	Wow! It's raspberry juice.
441440	443440	What should we do with the hat?
443440	446400	Well, I don't think it's a good idea to leave it lying around.
446400	448240	Somebody might crawl into it.
448240	452000	But if we put water in it, we can have as much raspberry juice as we can drink.
452720	457360	Well, that would be nice. But you know, Moong, it could only be river water that does that.
457360	458400	You know what I mean, Moong?
459120	461200	Well, I think it's worth experimenting.
463360	465360	What's the matter, Moong? You look very tired.
465360	468320	I woke up in the night and couldn't get back to sleep.
468320	489280	Ha! Pardon? Couldn't get back to sleep. Ha! What are you talking about?
489600	491520	I was awake last night too.
493680	496080	And I know why you're so tired.
496080	497440	You must have been dreaming.
497440	499440	Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in a hurry.
499440	500080	Thanks, Mama.
503040	505120	Where are you going, Moong? Moong!
505680	508320	Somewhere you can't come. Somewhere private.
509520	512320	So, what was that all about, huh?
512320	514640	Oh, nothing really important, Moong and Papa.
514640	518960	I think I'll go out.
528160	530400	Nobody hides anything from little, my.
537200	538080	Snuffkin!
538240	544080	Hey, I found out who's had it is.
544080	545280	Who's?
545280	546880	The Hobgoblins.
546880	548080	The Hobgoblins?
548080	552880	Yeah, I asked the Hemmielin and he told me that he saw him once long ago wearing that.
552880	555280	I heard about the wizard who flies in the sky.
555280	557280	Yeah, on the back of a black panther.
557280	561280	The Hobgoblins is hundreds of years old and cares only for rubies.
561280	564080	He rides all over the world, searching for them.
564080	566080	He's truly awesome.
568880	570880	And so, when he dropped his hat?
570880	575280	He must have been looking for some rubies right here in Moong and Valley.
575280	578080	Do you think he's got a lot of hats, Snuffkin?
578080	579280	Gee, I don't know.
579280	583280	Well, do you think perhaps he doesn't know where he dropped his hat?
583280	585280	Yeah, I suppose that's possible.
585280	590080	Snuffkin, there's something I would like to try with the hat.
590080	592080	Just don't put it on. Will you?
598080	599440	He's in there somewhere.
599440	602080	Hat lions are pretty stupid, you know.
602080	606880	Yes, Moong and Papa told me it takes him hours to dig themselves into the sand.
606880	609280	Oh, no, it doesn't. It only takes the one hour.
609280	611280	Only an hour? You're kidding.
611280	615280	Well, of course, an hour is a long time to spend digging.
615280	617280	Are you talking about me?
617280	622080	Yes, about how quickly you could dig yourself into a hole in the sand.
622080	625280	A lot quicker than you think it will take.
625280	629280	Moong in here says it takes you only one hour to dig a hole in the sand,
629280	631280	but I can't believe that.
631280	635280	Snuffkin says it takes several hours, but I think he's wrong.
635280	637280	I'll show you how long.
637280	641280	Gosh, that was rather fast.
641280	645280	Yeah, but it's obvious he's already got a ready-made hole hidden there.
645280	647280	Don't you ant lion?
647280	651280	No, I do not.
651280	655280	I can dig myself in anywhere, anywhere at all.
661280	663280	How about here?
663280	665280	Yeah, okay. Under this rock.
665280	666280	All right?
666280	668280	Anywhere. Just show me.
668280	670280	Okay, start from here.
670280	672280	Yeah, just there, if you don't mind.
672280	674280	All right, start counting.
675280	677280	Dude!
679280	682280	Wow, you only took a second and a half.
682280	684280	He's really something, isn't he?
684280	686280	He certainly is.
686280	688280	I'd better sit on it.
688280	690280	Yeah, he'll be really mad.
704280	707280	So you've caught the ant lion. I've been watching.
707280	708280	Little boy.
708280	709280	Right.
709280	712280	Did you follow us last night?
712280	713280	Yes.
713280	715280	Oh, did you tell the others?
715280	718280	Oh, don't be silly you guys. I haven't said a word yet.
718280	721280	But you will if we don't let you join in with us.
721280	723280	That's what she's doing, movement.
723280	725280	No, as if I do such a thing.
725280	728280	Of course, I'm forgetting how nice and kind you are.
730280	732280	Hey, what is that?
734280	736280	Nope, no hat anywhere.
748280	750280	There's gallons of water.
750280	753280	Gosh, there sure must be a lot of sand in there.
753280	757280	He must have changed into something else by now.
757280	758280	Probably.
758280	761280	There must have been long enough. Oh, jump off.
762280	766280	He isn't strong enough to move the rock by himself.
766280	768280	Shall we help him?
768280	769280	No, don't.
769280	771280	Come on, let's do it.
775280	777280	What's happened to him?
777280	779280	Let's turn it over.
779280	781280	Oh, no, I can't look.
791280	792280	Oh.
803280	805280	It's a hedgehog.
805280	807280	Oh, no, no, no.
807280	809280	It's a hedgehog.
809280	811280	It's a hedgehog.
816280	818280	Oh, no!
822280	824280	Oh, no!
838280	840280	Movement.
845280	846280	Oh, stop it.
846280	847280	Don't push me, Lucy.
847280	848280	Why?
848280	849280	Movement.
852280	854280	Movement.
874280	876280	Movement, I just saw the Hobgoblin.
876280	877280	What?
877280	879280	It must have been him.
879280	881280	Do you think he was looking for his hat?
881280	882280	I'm afraid so.
882280	884280	I hope you hit it well.
884280	885280	The seller.
886280	888280	Will it be safe there?
888280	892280	Well, only little my and us two know where it is.
900280	901280	Hmm.
901280	903280	The red?
904280	909280	I wonder if it's possible to change it into spaghetti.
924280	927280	Hmm, not exactly spaghetti.
928280	930280	Mama.
932280	934280	Mama.
934280	937280	There's something I think you ought to know.
937280	939280	What is it, dear?
939280	942280	There are strange things happening in the house.
942280	943280	In the house?
943280	945280	There's a tree in the seller.
945280	946280	A tree?
946280	948280	That's nice.
950280	953280	What did you say, a real tree?
953280	956280	Yes, and it seems to be growing and growing.
956280	958280	What have you done, little my?
958280	961280	Just dropped a bit of thread into the magic hat.
961280	963280	But movement threw it away.
963280	964280	Yeah, we did.
964280	967280	But we sort of found it again and put it in the seller.
967280	969280	Oh, dear.
969280	972280	We must tell movement papa before it's too late.
976280	977280	Come in.
977280	979280	It's not locked.
982280	984280	Keep going, tree.
984280	986280	You can grow as big as you like.
986280	989280	And just tell me if you're thirsty or anything.
993280	995280	And how about some fruit soon?
995280	997280	I really like pears.
1001280	1002280	Come in.
1002280	1004280	I'm very sorry to disturb you, papa.
1004280	1005280	What is it?
1005280	1008280	Well, it's not good.
1008280	1010280	What do you mean, not good?
1010280	1013280	I think you'd better come down and have a look at once.
1013280	1017280	So you can see for yourself what's happening before it's too late.
1017280	1019280	Too late?
1019280	1021280	Well, that sounds a bit ominous.
1021280	1023280	Don't worry. I'll sort it out.
1023280	1025280	Whatever the catastrophe.
1029280	1030280	Now, listen you.
1030280	1032280	You leave my husband's desk alone.
1032280	1034280	Or you'll be sorry.
1034280	1035280	All right, dear.
1035280	1037280	I'm coming.
1039280	1041280	Well, this is definitely a catastrophe.
1041280	1043280	I think you'd better get me a saw, Mama.
1043280	1045280	Oh, what's yo?
1045280	1050280	Everything's in the cellar, and it would be a bit difficult to get in there now, woman, papa.
1050280	1052280	They'll never mind. We haven't got time.
1052280	1054280	I'll break them by hand.
1072280	1074280	Gee, look at moving house.
1074280	1076280	Come on, Snork Maiden. This is fun.
1076280	1078280	But what happened, little Mai?
1078280	1080280	I've been gardening, that's all.
1080280	1082280	Aren't I clever?
1089280	1092280	Well, this catastrophe is going on too long.
1092280	1094280	I'm hungry.
1094280	1096280	Look on the bright side, papa.
1096280	1099280	It could be a long time before we run out of firewood.
1099280	1101280	There, take that.
1101280	1102280	Oh, oh.
1102280	1105280	That'll teach you to try and take over moment house.
1110280	1113280	Papa, look at all these lovely flowers.
1117280	1119280	And fruit.
1122280	1125280	Papa, papa, you must try some.
1125280	1128280	Oh, they're lovely and juicy.
1130280	1133280	Oh, no.
1133280	1136280	Little Mai must have put something into the hat.
1142280	1145280	Woman, where are you, woman?
1145280	1147280	Here I am.
1147280	1151280	Oh, woman, I was afraid that you were inside the house.
1151280	1154280	Mama, papa, little Mai.
1154280	1156280	They can't get out.
1157280	1159280	We'll need some saws and axes.
1159280	1161280	We must all be in the cellar and we can't get in this way.
1161280	1163280	We must try and find another way.
1163280	1165280	All right, I'll run and get some help.
1165280	1167280	You do not have to, little one.
1174280	1176280	Are you the hobgoblin, sir?
1176280	1177280	I am he.
1177280	1179280	I can see that you have found my hat.
1179280	1181280	Yes, sir.
1181280	1183280	It was on top of the mountain.
1183280	1185280	I think the...
1185280	1188280	That tree seems to be doing remarkably well.
1191280	1194280	However, away with thee.
1208280	1211280	Oh, my goodness, me.
1211280	1214280	Oh, my goodness.
1223280	1227280	That really is some hat you have there, Mr. Hobgoblin.
1227280	1229280	I'm sorry, I troubled you.
1229280	1233280	We're just glad you came along when you did, Mr. Hobgoblin.
1233280	1235280	You're most kind, madam.
1235280	1239280	I don't suppose you'd have any uncommonly large rubies here, would you?
1239280	1242280	You finding my hat here must be an omen.
1245280	1247280	Here you are, Mr. Hobgoblin.
1247280	1250280	My husband, Moomin, Papa gave it to me.
1252280	1258280	It is fine indeed, and you are lucky to have it, but I'm afraid it is not the King's Ruby I am looking for.
1258280	1261280	What do you mean, King's Ruby?
1261280	1264280	I have searched for it for hundreds of years, Moomin, Mama.
1264280	1268280	I'm afraid I am obsessed by it and cannot find it anywhere.
1268280	1271280	Well, if we see it, we'll light a signal fire.
1271280	1275280	You are most kind, madam, and I feel we shall meet again soon.
1286280	1289280	He's not bad for Hobgoblin.
1293280	1296280	Come on, everybody. Let's start stacking up all this wood.
1297280	1299280	Oh, King, let's do it!
1312280	1316280	And so the Hobgoblin's hat finally disappeared from Moomin Valley.
1316280	1320280	Moomin rather missed having an ever-ending supply of raspberry juice,
1320280	1324280	but his parents were more than happy that it had gone.
1327280	1334280	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomin's.
1334280	1341280	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.
1341280	1345280	They're always happy and always at play.
1345280	1352280	The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.
1353280	1357280	The Moomin's.
1357280	1364280	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomin's.
1364280	1371280	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.
1371280	1375280	They're always happy and always at play.
1375280	1382280	The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.
1382280	1386280	The Moomin's.
1386280	1392280	The Moomin's.
