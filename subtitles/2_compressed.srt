1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Oh, what exactly is it you're observing?

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,500
I'm sure I saw a beautiful crayfish in there.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,500
Crayfish? Excuse me, young man, but that is zoology.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Quite the most uninteresting field.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,500
There it is.

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:49,500
Oh! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

7
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I got him! I got him!

8
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,500
I got him!

9
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
A dragon?

10
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

11
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Papa!

12
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Oh, what have you got there?

13
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Oh, oh, nothing, Papa!

14
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Everything's so fresh after the rain, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

15
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Yes it is.

16
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
I gotta show this to Snuffkin before anybody else sees it.

17
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Mm-hmm.

18
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Oh!

19
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,500
Mm-hmm.

20
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
Boom, moment!

21
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
What have you got there, Moomin?

22
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Oh, oh, nothing! Nothing at all, little lion.

23
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Oh, yes, you have, I saw it! Don't lie to me!

24
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
It's just one of Mama's old jars.

25
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Liar, liar, I know there's something.

26
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
I don't think there's nothing.

27
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Then why are you hiding it?

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Oh, why did a little lion see me, it's not fair.

29
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Dragon?

30
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Ah, yeah, I was right.

31
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,500
It must be a baby dragon, probably the very last one on earth and washed up by the rain.

32
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
A dragon of my own.

33
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
That's wonderful.

34
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Oh, I hope I didn't frighten you.

35
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,500
I know what I'll do, I'll take the lid off the jar so you can get some fresh air, little dragon.

36
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
See, that's better, isn't it?

37
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Come on little fella, we'll give you a car to make you feel better.

38
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Oh, that burnt me!

39
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
What a piercing dragon you are!

40
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Don't worry, I'll look after you.

41
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
I'll take good care of you.

42
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,500
And when you're bigger and start to like me, I'll take you swimming in the sea.

43
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Oh, I'm sorry, you must be starving.

44
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,500
I'll get you something from my nighttime emergency food box.

45
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,500
I've got lots of things in there, bound to be something you like.

46
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,500
The one, take anything you want.

47
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Gosh, that's really clever little dragon.

48
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Moving, lunch is ready.

49
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Coming!

50
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Now you stay here.

51
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Don't worry, I'll be back in no time at all.

52
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Remember, you're my own little dragon.

53
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Oh!

54
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Where's Sniff? I thought he was here as well.

55
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
He's collecting worms for fishing.

56
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
He'll be here soon.

57
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
We'll start without him then.

58
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,500
You know, Mama, certain people keep secrets in glass jars.

59
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Secrets?

60
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Oh, yes, a little secret that hisses.

61
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Moment, Mama, I found this near the big puddle.

62
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Thank you, Sniff.

63
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Moment, I told you I wanted it back.

64
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
It's my very best one.

65
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Sorry, Mama, I was so excited I must have left it when I found...

66
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
I mean, when I was...

67
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,500
And I'm sure you know who I mean by certain people.

68
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Did you catch anything with the sieve, Moment?

69
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Yes, he did. Something that's now hidden in his room.

70
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Big mouth.

71
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
If it's a secret little my, perhaps he doesn't want to tell anyone.

72
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Yeah, probably because his new pet bites.

73
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Well, it hasn't bitten you yet, hasn't it?

74
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Huh, if it did, I'd bite it back.

75
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Is it true? Does your secret really bite people?

76
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Well, it couldn't bite very hard if it was small enough to go in a jar, could it, Papa?

77
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,500
I suppose certain people might keep other small things in jars,

78
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,500
beetles and spiders, mosquitoes, scorpions, or poisonous centipedes, horrible things.

79
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,500
That multiply and multiply every week and grow and grow until the jars are too small.

80
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
See? Like that.

81
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,500
And there'll be so many of them, thousands and thousands, and they'll take over Moon Valley and eat us all.

82
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Oh, well, I haven't got a centipede.

83
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Hmm, I wonder if centipedes come from outer space.

84
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
But this is the Earth's deer.

85
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,500
The rain could have brought them down from space, Mama, couldn't it?

86
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Well, you could be right. It was raining very hard yesterday.

87
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,500
And it wasn't like ordinary rain.

88
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
I saw a puddle as big as a lake.

89
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
What's the matter, Moon?

90
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
It isn't a centipede.

91
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Ha, we're on the right track, though.

92
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Well, I'm glad it's not a poisonous centipede. I shouldn't have liked that.

93
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Oh, you're asleep. Moonman's little dragon.

94
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Is it okay if I go see snuffkin, Mama?

95
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Have you finished already?

96
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Yes, I have. Tell them they mustn't go into my room. Or they'll have to take the consequence.

97
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,500
All right, Moonman. I'll make sure no one thinks.

98
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
I promise.

99
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Oh, but he's going to tell snuffkin this secret.

100
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
I should think he is.

101
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Best friends always come first, little my.

102
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Hey, snuffkin!

103
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Hi!

104
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Fishing again?

105
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Yep. The cards told me that if I caught five minutes, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south.

106
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
South?

107
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
You're joking!

108
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
Not at all. I believe in the cards.

109
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,500
But snuffkin, winter's not here yet.

110
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,500
I know that. But the cards tell you things for a reason, Moonman.

111
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Oh, do they really? But it would be awfully few anyway, snuffkin. Just awful.

112
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
I mean, I'd be very lonely.

113
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Well, anyway, who would I talk to or tell my secrets to?

114
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Oh, snuffkin, quickly! You always come up to Moonman House.

115
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Now?

116
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Yeah.

117
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Well, I suppose I could fish later.

118
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
No, no, there's no point.

119
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
But I have to catch five minutes.

120
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Oh!

121
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,500
The fish won't bite after all his rain. You'd catch nothing. It'll be better to wait until it stops flowing so fast.

122
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Well, perhaps you're right.

123
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,500
So what's this big secret all about?

124
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Hey, Moonman.

125
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
Have you ever seen a dragon snuffkin?

126
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,500
No, of course not. They all disappeared off the face of the earth many hundreds of years ago.

127
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,500
But perhaps they didn't all disappear. What if there was one alive somewhere?

128
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
That's impossible.

129
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
It could be so small that it would go in a glass jar, snuffkin.

130
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Are you sure you're not daydreaming, Moonman? But still, anything is possible, I suppose.

131
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,500
But you know me. I have to see it right in front of me before I believe it.

132
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Oh!

133
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Oh, where is it?

134
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Oh, where is it?

135
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Mama promised me that she wouldn't let anyone in.

136
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
It's not here either.

137
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Well, you were right, Moonman.

138
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Huh?

139
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Ah, there he is.

140
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
I think you've found a real dragon.

141
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
How do you get up there? He must have full. He might lose his tail.

142
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Oh, little dragon. And snuffkin, keep quiet.

143
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
You might get frightened and do something silly.

144
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Don't worry. I'll soon have you down.

145
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,500
This will do. I'll lay it on the floor here.

146
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Jump, little dragon. Don't be afraid.

147
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Come on. Hold on to this. It will bring you down slowly.

148
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Don't panic.

149
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
I don't think it's a very good idea, Moonman.

150
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
You'll only scare him away.

151
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Why don't you just leave him alone?

152
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,500
He'll come down when he's ready. Dragons aren't helpless, you know. Even little baby ones.

153
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,500
But he's so small. Come to Moonman.

154
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Come on. Don't you understand?

155
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Hold on to that and I'll listen to that.

156
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Look at him.

157
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,500
My dragon can fly. He's flying. He's flying.

158
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Come down, little dragon. You might question or something.

159
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Come down.

160
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Be careful snuffkin. He might bite.

161
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,500
I don't think so. He's a very unusual pet.

162
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,500
I think he likes you more than me.

163
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
What a charming little creature, Moonman.

164
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
He's lovely. What's his name?

165
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
He's called Little Dragon.

166
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Ha. I don't think he's lovely at all.

167
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Small but savage, if you ask my opinion.

168
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
That sounds just like you, little my.

169
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
You think so?

170
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Ow!

171
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Ow, ow, ow.

172
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Now look here.

173
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
He seems to have a thing about ears, doesn't he?

174
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Step snuffkins. Why doesn't he bite him?

175
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Go on, dragon. Go on, bite him. He's really tasty. Go on.

176
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Good news. I think he's trying to heat up snuffkins coffee. He must really like him.

177
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Clevver, little sea.

178
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Well, I hope he's careful with that hot breath. We don't want to start a fire.

179
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
All right, that's enough.

180
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,500
He might be useful. When he's bigger, we can put him in the cellar

181
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,500
and he'll be able to heat the whole house just like a furnace.

182
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
No, we will not.

183
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Go away! You pass!

184
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Ow!

185
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
And you!

186
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,500
He only thought you were trying to get his fly.

187
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I'll get him if he bites me again. Just you watch me do it.

188
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Come on, little dragon.

189
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Ow!

190
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,500
I'm sure that'll keep him quiet. That better go. Thanks for the coffee, Mumma.

191
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Oh no, it'll suffocate him.

192
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
He only seems to like snuffkin.

193
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Well, we all like snuffkin.

194
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Stupid old dragon.

195
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
No, he isn't.

196
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Mum and dear, why don't you take him to your room? He'll be happier there.

197
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
This will be best for him.

198
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Oh, I wonder if he'll come back to visit us.

199
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Why did you do that? He was cute and we could have always worn earmuffs.

200
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
You can visit him in snuffkin's tent.

201
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,500
I expect little dragons already sitting on his shoulder.

202
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
It doesn't matter anyway, snuffkin's going south soon.

203
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
They'll be able to go together.

204
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Oh, my dear, Mumma. Never mind.

205
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Well, you're a bit of a problem.

206
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
I don't want you here, little dragon.

207
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Go on, go away. Go to Mumma.

208
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Don't do that.

209
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Oh, come on, please go to Mumma.

210
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Look, you're very nice and it'll be fun to have you along.

211
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,500
But there's movement, and he'd know you were here and you'd be upset.

212
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Oh, there's another one.

213
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,500
That's the fifth? Oh, dear.

214
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Hmm?

215
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Any luck?

216
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Not bad. Are you going far?

217
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Oh, I'm far away.

218
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Would you like some fresh fish?

219
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
I'm sure you'll get hungry.

220
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Yeah, what do you want in return?

221
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
A small favor.

222
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Take this as far as you can, open the lid and just leave it.

223
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
What? Just leave it?

224
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Yes, in a nice quiet place, with lots and lots of flies.

225
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Flies? What's in there?

226
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
A dragon.

227
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
A dragon? Does it bite?

228
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Well, it might.

229
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,500
This is a big favor. I don't even like minnows.

230
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Oh, they're not too bad if you roast them.

231
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Keep the lid on, but make sure you open it up later so it can catch the flies.

232
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
All right, as long as it doesn't try to bite me.

233
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Don't worry, it won't.

234
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Hello.

235
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Hi.

236
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Oh, well, where is he?

237
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Who is that?

238
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,500
My dragon. He must have come here, snuffkin.

239
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Oh, really? I thought he was home with you, sleeping in your room.

240
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,500
No, I left him out.

241
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Ah, well, dragons are very fickle.

242
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
All they really care about is big fat flies.

243
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
It's best to forget about a moment.

244
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Did you catch your five minnows?

245
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,500
No, you were right. The water's too fast.

246
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Oh, really?

247
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
So I won't go south until winter comes.

248
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
You'll stay here then?

249
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Well, I'm sure it wouldn't do to go against the cards.

250
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Now what a moment, my friend.

251
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Oh, that's great. You're staying snuffkin.

252
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,500
That's fantastic. That's really, really good.

253
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Ah, perhaps I shouldn't have painted the float bright red.

254
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500
It might have scared those little minnows right away.

255
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Okay, let's go.

256
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Yeah.

257
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,500
That dragon was sort of stupid.

258
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Baby dragons are.

259
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
They make the world's worst pets.

260
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
They never want to settle in one place.

261
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Yeah, you're right.

262
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,500
It was very funny, though, when it bit little mice here.

263
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,500
I think it gave her a taste of her own medicine.

264
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,500
The movement was very happy that snuffkin was staying in movement valley

265
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,500
and not going south until winter.

266
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:21,500
And as for the dragon, well, who wants to be loved by a silly old dragon?

267
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:28,500
They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.

268
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

269
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,500
They're always happy and always at play.

270
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,500
The movements are having fun day after day.

271
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,500
The movements.

272
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,500
The movements.

273
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:57,500
They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.

274
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

275
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,500
They're always happy and always at play.

276
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,500
The movements are having fun day after day.

277
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,500
The movements.

278
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,500
The movements.

279
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:26,500
The movements.

280
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Here they are for one another.

281
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,500
The movements are about to come.

282
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Come on and sit down here with me.

283
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Therefore you want your TV.

284
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,500
They are the movements.

285
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,500
They are the movements.

286
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,500
So come with me, give me your hand.

287
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,500
I'll take you up to a movement land.

288
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,500
You can fly just like a bird.

289
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Sing that song ever.

290
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,500
There were the movements.

291
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,500
There were the movements.

292
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
There were the movements.

293
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
There were the movements.

294
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,500
There were the movements.

295
00:20:30,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

296
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:30,500
da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

297
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Have you found a new plant or something?

298
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,500
I'm afraid not, and I think I must have examined every single plant in Moomin Valley.

299
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
I know what you mean.

300
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,500
There isn't a single person living here that I don't know.

301
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Oh, yes, yes, quite.

302
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Look, why don't you come over and have a cup of tea, Mr. Evelyn?

303
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Hmm?

304
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Isn't that Moomin and little Mai?

305
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Yes, I think it is.

306
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Really, a moment, Papa, peeping into people's homes.

307
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Oh, it's an empty house, Mr. Evelyn.

308
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Oh, it's an empty house, Mr. Evelyn.

309
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Moomin, what are you looking at?

310
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Oh, what are you looking at?

311
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
I'm not looking at you.

312
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
I'm not looking at you.

313
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Moomin, what are you looking at?

314
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Oh, hello, Papa.

315
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
Nobody's lived in there for years.

316
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Somebody's just moved in.

317
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Oh, really?

318
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Let me have a look.

319
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Oh, goodness.

320
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
How tidy they are.

321
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Perhaps the children will play with us.

322
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Oh, they might, but they seem a bit too well behaved for that.

323
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
I must have a closer look at them.

324
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Me too, Moomin, Papa, but the trouble is they never come outside the fence.

325
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
Well, in that case, we'll have to go in.

326
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
How do we do that, Papa?

327
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
We can't just walk in there.

328
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
See, you want to borrow some sugar?

329
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
That should do it.

330
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Oh, Mr. Hamilton, where's your imagination?

331
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Will you please lend me your magnifying glass?

332
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
But surely.

333
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
Here it is.

334
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Oh, that should do it.

335
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,500
What are you going to do, Papa?

336
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Now then, you all stay out here.

337
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,500
My plan will only work if it looks as though I'm on my own.

338
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Oh, but what is your plan, Papa?

339
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
I hope Papa knows what he's doing.

340
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
They don't look that friendly to me.

341
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Me neither.

342
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Mama, there's someone coming.

343
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Oh, what do you want, my good man?

344
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
Come on, tell me quickly.

345
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Do you hear me?

346
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

347
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
I didn't think anyone lived here.

348
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,500
Well, we do know you know we just moved in.

349
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Really?

350
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
Oh, do forgive me, madame.

351
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500
I certainly didn't mean to trespass.

352
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Ah, so what are you doing here in the garden, man?

353
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,500
Researching the travel system of ants.

354
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
I didn't know they had one.

355
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's fascinating.

356
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
How they find their way and build their roads,

357
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
and they're not here now, of course.

358
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
But this is their main road.

359
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,500
It's very quiet at the moment, but at busy times, it's packed.

360
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,500
I'm afraid I can't see any main road.

361
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Oh, you would if you were an expert.

362
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Anyway, I'll point it out to you next time they're on the move

363
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,500
in the vicinity, of course, but it's worth looking out for.

364
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

365
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
I'm your next door neighbor, though.

366
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
We live quite a long way away.

367
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,500
I'm Moomin.

368
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,500
Ah, so you must be Moomin Papa, aren't you?

369
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Yes, that's me.

370
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,500
How did you know?

371
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Did someone mention my name to you?

372
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,500
We were told the movements were a bit unusual.

373
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
Very nice, they said, though.

374
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,500
How very flattering, thank you.

375
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
And you're Mrs.

376
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Billy Junk, mother and housewife.

377
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Well, it's an honour to meet you, Mrs. Philly Junk.

378
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Well done, Papa.

379
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,500
It looks like you found us some new friends to play with.

380
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Oh, welcome, party.

381
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Don't you think it's a good idea?

382
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,500
We haven't had a party for ages, Mama.

383
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,500
But you hardly know them, and I've never even met them.

384
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,500
But Mama, how can we show them that they're really welcome

385
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,500
if they could meet everyone at a party, couldn't they?

386
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
And I could take care of all the children.

387
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
I know just what to do.

388
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Splendid, Moomin.

389
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Ah, Mr. Hebblin, I know Moomin Papa.

390
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
You'd like me to do the fireworks.

391
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,500
It looks like we're throwing a party.

392
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
We'll have lots of pretty flowers.

393
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,500
Just tell me what you want, Mama, and we'll do it.

394
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,500
It's great.

395
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Those kids will just love it.

396
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,500
If they survive, Moomin.

397
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
Now then, children.

398
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
The Moomin's are all a little bit odd.

399
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
So behead properly.

400
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Yes, mother, we will.

401
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
They'll be here soon.

402
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Take this in, Moomin.

403
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,500
Okay.

404
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
The children work really well.

405
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Good. I must try it.

406
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Mmm, these look nice.

407
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Oh, stiff. Leave them alone, will you?

408
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,500
Oh, all right. Just this one.

409
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Huh?

410
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Huh? They're here.

411
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Come on, everybody. They'll soon be at the door.

412
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
Right. Come on, children.

413
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Help me with the flowers.

414
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Oh, dear. Fireworks now are later on.

415
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Oh, later on. I think you'll very whole-finally.

416
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
Welcome to Moomin House, Mrs. Fitzgerald.

417
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,500
It was very kind of you to invite us, Moomin, Mama.

418
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,500
Come in, please, and make yourselves at home.

419
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Oh, thank you all very much indeed.

420
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

421
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Oh, all in my hair.

422
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,500
It looks very untidy, doesn't it, mother?

423
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,500
It's a surprise. They should have been rose buds,

424
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
but we couldn't find any at all.

425
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Oh, yes. Dear, what a mess.

426
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,500
Oh, Mrs. Philly chunk, let me introduce the children.

427
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
They all look different.

428
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Well, yes. Only Moomin is really ours.

429
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,500
The others are sort of, uh, I'm sure they'll all get on.

430
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,500
Oh, I'm afraid my children do not play.

431
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,500
They would much rather read or study.

432
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Oh, are you sure they've got to have some time for play?

433
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
I'm sure.

434
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,500
Well, come into the dining room anyway.

435
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
You can watch the others play.

436
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
Make sure the chairs are clean.

437
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Yes, mother, we will.

438
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
Won't you let them play at all?

439
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
No, I will not.

440
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Come on, everybody.

441
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Wouldn't you like to have a go on our slide?

442
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
No.

443
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,500
Hmm. You'd really enjoy it once you got going.

444
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
I know you would.

445
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
No, thank you. No, no, not at all.

446
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,500
No, definitely not.

447
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,500
And you're really quite sure, are you?

448
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Yes.

449
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
I thought so.

450
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Then we've got it all to ourselves.

451
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
Yahoo!

452
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Moomin sounds like he's having fun.

453
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Oh, and that's little Mayan sniff.

454
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,500
Your children seem very quiet, Mrs. Billy Junk.

455
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,500
Good children are seen and not heard, my dear.

456
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
That was one of mine.

457
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
And that was another.

458
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,500
Well, it sounds like they're having fun for once.

459
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Now, have a biscuit, Mrs. Billy Junk.

460
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,500
They have an unusual taste.

461
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,500
I'd run out of flowers, so I used them.

462
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
Don't worry.

463
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Moomin will look after them.

464
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Go on, it's your turn now.

465
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
My children.

466
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Stop it. It's too dangerous.

467
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
You might hurt yourself.

468
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Oh, come on, stop it at once.

469
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
Now, don't you worry, Mrs. Billy Junk.

470
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,500
I've got ointment in my bag if they hurt themselves.

471
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
But you'll hear mother.

472
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Stop children, you hear me.

473
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
We're going home now.

474
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
Stop it.

475
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Oh, this is great.

476
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,500
It's time for the glorious finale, Papa.

477
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,500
I can't say I wasn't warned.

478
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
Exposing them to this.

479
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Moomin Valley is no place for proper children.

480
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
No place for children.

481
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
No place for children.

482
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
No place for children.

483
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
No place for children.

484
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
No place at all.

485
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
Oh, dear, what's this?

486
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,500
There are fireworks in your honor.

487
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
Fireworks.

488
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,500
I made them especially to welcome you.

489
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Goodbye, come back soon.

490
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
Yeah, we'll come tomorrow.

491
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
No, you will not.

492
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,500
I don't think Mrs. Billy Junk enjoyed her party.

493
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
She's very lucky that I didn't bite her.

494
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,500
She should have had a go on the slide.

495
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
I'm sure she would have loved it,

496
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
and then she wouldn't have shouted at her children.

497
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Don't, don't slide down, shoot, sniff.

498
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
They're too afraid of looking silly.

499
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Whoa!

500
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Oh, oh.

501
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Papa.

502
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,500
Oh, I'm very sorry, Moomin, but don't worry.

503
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
I'll fix it.

504
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Is it nothing much broken?

505
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
What happened, my dear?

506
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Well, I thought it had been such a long time since I'd been on the slide that I'd have a go.

507
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,500
I didn't think I'd be too heavy for it.

508
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
I know.

509
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,500
When we mend it, why don't we make it strong enough for me and Mama to play on as well?

510
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
I think she'd like that.

511
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
That's a good idea, Papa.

512
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
But we want to use it, too.

513
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Well, that's a cool idea.

514
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
I'll just try it out, now and again.

515
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,500
I want you to stay here while I'm out.

516
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
What if somebody asks us to play?

517
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
What do you mean, play?

518
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,500
I hope you're not thinking of the Moomin, are you?

519
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,500
I don't want you mixing with those noisy children ever again, do you hear me?

520
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Where are you going, mother?

521
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,500
To look for another house.

522
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,500
It was a terrible mistake coming to Moomin Valley.

523
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Look, there's Mrs. Philly drunk.

524
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
Good afternoon.

525
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Please stay away from my children.

526
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,500
But why?

527
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,500
We thought they might like to come and have an adventure with us.

528
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Oh, never mind.

529
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Let's go.

530
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
Hey, hang on a minute.

531
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
Oh, you're Tarzan.

532
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
I can't take it.

533
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
It's too late for you now, Sniff.

534
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,500
Oh, no, not the hungry crocodile at the bottom of the porch.

535
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,500
We should have brought the Philly Junks with us.

536
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
But Moomin missed his Philly Junks.

537
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
He's not told her.

538
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,500
Have you been killed and eaten yet, Sniff?

539
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:47,500
No, I fell on top of the crocodile and knocked him out and then swam me shore.

540
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Sniff, but I thought you couldn't swim.

541
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,500
On your own business.

542
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Hey, that looks like the Philly Junks.

543
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Why don't they come over here?

544
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,500
I bet their mother told them not to talk to us.

545
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
See if I care you.

546
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Hey, what are you doing?

547
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Why aren't you playing with Moomin and the others?

548
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
I don't think they want to play with us.

549
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,500
They didn't call for us when they weren't past.

550
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Stinky's arrived and wonder what he's doing here.

551
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,500
I bet you it's no fun stuck in that garden.

552
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,500
No, we'd rather be out here playing.

553
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Well, I know somewhere much better than Moomin's.

554
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
It's a great place to play.

555
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Do you?

556
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
Yes, would I lie to you?

557
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,500
It's a bit of a way off, but it'll be really exciting and lots of fun.

558
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
So do you want to come or not?

559
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Well, it is a bit boring here.

560
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
Yes, very.

561
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,500
Do you really think they don't want to play with us?

562
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Doesn't it look like it?

563
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,500
There's absolutely right.

564
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
So come on if you're coming because I can't wait.

565
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
What stinky up to?

566
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
I don't trust him.

567
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Okay, now this is the place I told you about.

568
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Good, isn't it?

569
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,500
Now, if you hang on to that rope, you can swing over to the other side and back again.

570
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Don't worry, it's quite safe.

571
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
That's great.

572
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,500
I've never been anywhere like this.

573
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
A bit frightening.

574
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,500
Without the thrill, where's the fun?

575
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,500
You need a bit of danger to spice it up.

576
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Gee, Willikers, it looks like the other side is harder than this side.

577
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Yes, I bet it's all right.

578
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
You just have to put your legs up, that's all.

579
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
Who wants to go first?

580
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,500
I've got it. Why don't you all go together?

581
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
What? The three of us?

582
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,500
See, this way you won't feel so scared, Willik.

583
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,500
No, not together.

584
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Well, why don't you go one at a time then?

585
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,500
That way it's always more fun.

586
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
Can you do it, stinky?

587
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Don't be silly. Of course I can.

588
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
I do it all the time.

589
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
One of the things I'm best at.

590
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Even if I do say so myself.

591
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,500
So, why don't you show us, stinky?

592
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
Moonman!

593
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
I didn't know you were such a robespringer, stinky.

594
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,500
I'm sure he didn't either.

595
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,500
So, this is your usual place, is it?

596
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Well, sort of.

597
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
You know something?

598
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,500
If you hadn't said that you'd done this lots of times,

599
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,500
I wouldn't have believed that I could have done it myself.

600
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,500
Come on, stinky. Show us how you do it.

601
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,500
If you go first, I'll be second.

602
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
No, it's all right. You can go first, moment.

603
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Hello, I want to see how it's done.

604
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,500
Then throw me the rope, and I'll follow.

605
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
Now, tell the truth.

606
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
You've never done it. Have you, stinky?

607
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Of course I've done it, stupid.

608
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Now, come on. Come on.

609
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Don't be such a spoiled sport.

610
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
We're all here waiting to cheer you on.

611
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
All right, everybody.

612
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,500
I give you the brave and bold Tarzan, stinky.

613
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
Are you watching?

614
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Are you ready, stinky?

615
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
A big cheer, everyone.

616
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
Waiting for you.

617
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Oh, stinky, my big brave hero, jump.

618
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Well, go on. We're all waiting for you, stinky.

619
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,500
Come on, stinky. Show us how it's done.

620
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
Come on, stinky.

621
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Come on, stinky.

622
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Come on, stinky.

623
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Come on, stinky.

624
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Ah!

625
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,500
Oh, so this is how you've done it lots of times before, is it?

626
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Yes, the rope must have shrunk.

627
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
Oh!

628
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
He was trying to fool you.

629
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,500
It was a dangerous game, and he knew very well it couldn't be done.

630
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,500
I did it!

631
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Now, why don't you come with us and play properly?

632
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,500
You're gonna be Tarzan as long as you like.

633
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500
And we're all here.

634
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Oh, you're gonna be fine.

635
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,500
Now, why don't you come with us and play properly?

636
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500
You're gonna be Tarzan as long as you like.

637
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
And when you get tired, just let go of the rope.

638
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,500
All right, stinky.

639
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
Come on, stinky.

640
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Yeah!

641
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,500
You can't just leave me here, you fox.

642
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Ah!

643
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
It isn't fair, please.

644
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Help!

645
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,500
Don't leave me here.

646
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,500
Woo!

647
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Woo!

648
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Yeah!

649
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,500
But stinky was left on his own to decide whether to climb up the rope or drop into the river.

650
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,500
And the filajong children had more fun than they'd ever had before,

651
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,500
but they didn't get home until very late in the evening.

652
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Bye, we'll see you tomorrow.

653
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Okay, mommy.

654
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Bye, momen.

655
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
Bye-bye.

656
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Bye-bye.

657
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,500
Oh, my dear children, I told you to stay at home!

658
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,500
What earth have you been? Where have you been?

659
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
With movement of the others.

660
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
They kidnapped you, did they?

661
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
No, we've been playing with them.

662
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Well, you can just forget about the movements we're moving out as soon as we possibly can.

663
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Moving, mother?

664
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Yes, right away from this valley, this is no place for a spotless and well-ordered home.

665
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,500
What's the matter?

666
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
No, we don't want to move.

667
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,500
Ah!

668
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
We want to stay, mother.

669
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Oh!

670
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
Movement house is nice and dusty.

671
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
We want to stay in the movement valley forever.

672
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,500
Oh, please, mother, we love it here.

673
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,500
Oh, after all I've done for you children.

674
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:54,500
And my experience children usually get what they want.

675
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:21,500
And that was how Phila John and her three children became permanent residents.

676
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:39,500
And that was how Phila John and her three children became permanent residents of movement valley.

677
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:46,500
They loved the laughter and they loved the living the movements.

678
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:53,500
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

679
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,500
They're always happy and always at play.

680
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,500
The movements are having fun day after day.

681
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,500
The movements.

682
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,500
The movements.

683
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:15,500
They loved the laughter and they loved the living the movements.

684
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:22,500
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

685
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,500
They're always happy and always at play.

686
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,500
The movements are having fun day after day.

687
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,500
The movements.

688
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,500
The movements.

689
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:44,500
The movements.

690
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:14,500
The movements.

691
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:19,500
The movements.

692
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,500
The movements.

693
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:29,500
The movements.

694
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:34,500
The movements.

695
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:41,500
There were the movements.

696
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:48,500
There were the movements.

697
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:55,500
The movements.

698
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,500
The movements.

699
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:06,500
The movements.

700
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:12,500
The movements.

701
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:19,500
The movements.

702
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:26,500
The movements.

703
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:38,500
For a whole week, snort maiden had been curled up on the sofa, reading fairy tales.

704
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:50,500
It's a lovely day and at last movement is persuaded to come out for a walk in the lonely mountains.

705
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:56,500
It's beautiful up here, aren't you glad you came now?

706
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:01,500
This is much better than fairy tales, isn't it snort maiden?

707
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:08,500
Oh look, moment, it's Adelweis.

708
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,500
No, it isn't. That doesn't grow here at all.

709
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,500
I'm sure it is. I know what it looks like.

710
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,500
I'm sorry, but it's not.

711
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,500
Oh, it's just like in Heidi.

712
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,500
No, it's not. It's just a daisy.

713
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,500
Oh, come on. I want to pick it.

714
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
Oh, no, it's too dangerous.

715
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,500
I know then. You can do it. You're my boyfriend, aren't you, Moomin?

716
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,500
Well, I suppose we could climb down there, but I promise you it's not Adelweis.

717
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,500
That only grows in the Alps and there are hundreds of miles away.

718
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:47,500
I know it's Adelweis.

719
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Be careful. They don't care about danger in fairy tales.

720
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:56,500
That's why they call them fairy tales, silly.

721
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,500
Fairy Princess, please accept this, my humble offering.

722
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,500
Thank you, Brave Knight. You were right, Moomin. This isn't Adelweis.

723
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,500
See, I told you, it's going to be hard to get down from here, you know?

724
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,500
Can't we go back the way we came?

725
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,500
Well, I think it'll be easier to try to get to that path.

726
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,500
If you say so.

727
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,500
It's nearer anyway, and better than going up.

728
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,500
I'm surprised you're such a good climber.

729
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,500
Oh, Royalty is good at practically everything.

730
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,500
Oh, it's not made of.

731
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:49,500
It's not made of.

732
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:56,500
It's not made of.

733
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:02,500
It's not made of.

734
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:09,500
Let me see six pebbles.

735
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:14,500
What was that, a giant snowball? It can't be, it isn't winter.

736
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:20,500
Well, nothing of interest to me. Now, where was I?

737
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,500
We start hemulating. Has Snork Maiden just gone past you?

738
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,500
Snork Maiden. No, all I've seen going past is a very large snowball.

739
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,500
That was Snork Maiden.

740
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,500
But she's not made of snow.

741
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Stop! Snork Maiden, stop!

742
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:46,500
Snork Maiden!

743
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,500
Snork Maiden!

744
00:47:50,500 --> 00:48:03,500
Oh, I'll praise the boob all she's still breathing. She's just knocked herself out.

745
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:10,500
Oh, Mom, what's happened to her?

746
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,500
She's unconscious.

747
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,500
Oh, what are you trying to do?

748
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,500
I want to get her home to Mama.

749
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,500
Oh, difficult. She should lose a bit of weight.

750
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,500
Perhaps she'd come around if we splashed cold water on her face.

751
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,500
Oh, there's nothing to fetch it in.

752
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,500
Ah, if you cut some bark off a tree trunk, you could make a small container.

753
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,500
What a good idea. If you stay here, I'll go and do that.

754
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,500
Wake up, Snork Maiden.

755
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:57,500
Oh, that's cold.

756
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:07,500
Has she come around yet, Mr. Himulet?

757
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,500
No.

758
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,500
Okay.

759
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,500
Oh, good. It's working.

760
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,500
How are you feeling, Snork Maiden?

761
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,500
Are you all right, Snork Maiden?

762
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,500
Where am I?

763
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,500
We're still up in Lonely Mountains.

764
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,500
Who am I?

765
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:33,500
Why Royal Highness the Princess of Lonely Mountains?

766
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,500
What? A Princess?

767
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:39,500
Oh, yes, of course.

768
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,500
And who are you?

769
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,500
I am the Prince of Lonely Mountains.

770
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,500
Oh, yeah.

771
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,500
Oh, yeah.

772
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
With that ridiculous shape?

773
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,500
No.

774
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,500
A gesture, perhaps.

775
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,500
You want?

776
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,500
You there.

777
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,500
Do not laugh.

778
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,500
I think the poor girl must have lost her memory.

779
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,500
Of course not. She's just pretending.

780
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,500
One does not whisper with royalty present.

781
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,500
Do you hear?

782
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:20,500
So sorry, Royal Highness.

783
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,500
A poor crafters cabin.

784
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,500
This is your castle, ma'am.

785
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,500
Royalty doesn't live in shacks.

786
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,500
Snork Maiden.

787
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,500
Stop calling us that.

788
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,500
It's very rude.

789
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
Oh, forgive me.

790
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,500
Our royal castle is elsewhere.

791
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,500
Is it not?

792
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,500
What?

793
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,500
That must be hunting lodge.

794
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,500
No, of course that's what it is.

795
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,500
Good. We accept that.

796
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,500
Are you two going to tell me what you're so busy looking at?

797
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:08,500
Send a maid to my room, my good man.

798
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,500
A maid?

799
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,500
My good man.

800
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,500
Papa, have you seen Snork Maiden?

801
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,500
Yes, up there.

802
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:31,500
Mama, please would you go on have a word with Snork Maiden?

803
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,500
Have you been quarreling?

804
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,500
Oh, no.

805
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,500
It's just that she fell and banged her head.

806
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,500
And now she thinks she's a royal princess.

807
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,500
What?

808
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,500
Ah, Nanette! Come here, please.

809
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,500
Nanette?

810
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,500
I'm Boomin, Mama.

811
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,500
Oh, we're too weary for your foolish jokes, girl.

812
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:01,500
Oh, we are very tired indeed, Nanette.

813
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:05,500
Please bring our silk nighty with the hand embroidered swans and clowns.

814
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Then you may go.

815
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,500
I wish you, Mama.

816
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,500
All right, I'm sure.

817
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,500
But she seems convinced she's a princess.

818
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,500
Sounds as if it's dangerous, doesn't it, Mama?

819
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,500
Oh, I don't think so.

820
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,500
I was only joking when I called her a princess.

821
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,500
I'm very glad you didn't call her an opera singer.

822
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,500
Is Snork Maiden asleep now?

823
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,500
Oh, yes.

824
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,500
In a night gown with crowns and swans embroidered on it.

825
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,500
And another thing, Boomin, she wants a canopy put up immediately.

826
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,500
What's that?

827
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:43,500
Oh, a fancy cover over the bed that's draped in silks, envelopes, and tassels.

828
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,500
Oh, she was very upset because there wasn't one there already.

829
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,500
It might not be necessary.

830
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,500
Her memory could have come back by the time she wakes up.

831
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,500
Why don't we wait and see?

832
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,500
She might be fine after a rest.

833
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,500
I sure hope so.

834
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,500
But what do we do if it hasn't come back?

835
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,500
Let's think about that if it happens.

836
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,500
We might not have to build that canopy.

837
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,500
Let me try it.

838
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,500
Try what?

839
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,500
To get Snork Maiden's memory back, what else?

840
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,500
Oh, how?

841
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,500
Well, I think that if she sees me, she'll remember me

842
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,500
and then she'll remember everything else too.

843
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,500
Don't be silly little Maiden.

844
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,500
If she doesn't remember me, why should you remember you, eh?

845
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,500
Simple, because I'm unforgettable.

846
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,500
There is that, I suppose.

847
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,500
She's still fast asleep.

848
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,500
Well, I'm glad we made the canopy anyway.

849
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,500
It looks really great, doesn't it?

850
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,500
Oh, look, she's opening her eyes.

851
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,500
Are you awake?

852
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,500
Get up, Snork Maiden.

853
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,500
Come on.

854
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,500
Let's go down to the beach.

855
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,500
And who is that person?

856
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,500
Come on, you remember me.

857
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,500
I warn you if you don't, you'll be sorry.

858
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,500
Oh, quite amusing.

859
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,500
Ah, so you remember me now.

860
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,500
Of course we do.

861
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,500
There you are, I told you.

862
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,500
Who am I then?

863
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,500
Well, you're another court jester.

864
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,500
Of course.

865
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:15,500
Don't be little like a court jester.

866
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:19,500
Oh, very funny.

867
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,500
She's a better clown than the other one.

868
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,500
You can perform at our wedding.

869
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,500
You're a wedding.

870
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,500
Hey, hey, hey, boy.

871
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:37,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

872
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

873
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,500
There you are.

874
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,500
Hi, stinky.

875
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,500
What are you doing here?

876
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,500
A moment asked me to come over to a moment house

877
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,500
and propose to some princess.

878
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,500
Moments lost his marbles as well then.

879
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,500
I think he wanted stinky as a contrast.

880
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,500
You what?

881
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,500
You mean to tell me you're both my rivals

882
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,500
for the hands of the royal princess?

883
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,500
Well, it's not very original.

884
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,500
But in order to win the princess

885
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,500
and have her kingdom stinky,

886
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,500
you'll need to solve three riddles.

887
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,500
Hey, that's great.

888
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,500
What's this kingdom like?

889
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,500
All right, sooner number one,

890
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,500
you may now enter.

891
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,500
Oh, that's me.

892
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,500
Oh!

893
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,500
Oh, hi, princess.

894
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,500
How are you doing?

895
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,500
Jester, is this man a suitor?

896
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,500
He is.

897
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,500
I fear he does not treat us with respect.

898
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,500
Forgive him, your highness.

899
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,500
He is from a foreign land.

900
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,500
And does not know the ways of your kingdom.

901
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,500
Hmm.

902
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,500
Well, all right.

903
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,500
Very well.

904
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,500
Here is the first riddle.

905
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,500
Are you ready?

906
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,500
Are you away?

907
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,500
Now then, listen.

908
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,500
What is it that is yellow?

909
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,500
Has four legs and sings.

910
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,500
Oh, dear.

911
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,500
An unusual canary?

912
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,500
With four legs, you nincompoop.

913
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,500
I don't know any birds with four legs.

914
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,500
Who said it was a bird?

915
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,500
All right, then.

916
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,500
What's the answer, snark baby?

917
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,500
He shows no respect.

918
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,500
Throw him into a dungeon and give him no food.

919
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,500
Your highness, he is temporarily out of his mind

920
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,500
after a long journey here.

921
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,500
Hang on.

922
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,500
I'm not out of my mind.

923
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,500
Shut up, kid.

924
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,500
That's what's the answer.

925
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,500
That's what I want to know.

926
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,500
Silence, it does not concern you.

927
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,500
We believe you to be of lowly birth.

928
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,500
Sorry about this, napkin.

929
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,500
Don't worry.

930
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,500
Hmm.

931
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,500
No, sir.

932
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,500
Galad, but not bad.

933
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,500
I am honored to be here, your royal highness.

934
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,500
He'll do.

935
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,500
An easy riddle to start.

936
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,500
Here it is.

937
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,500
First, what is the number of which we think?

938
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,500
Take your time.

939
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,500
Two?

940
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,500
For a faux-galat night, that is correct.

941
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,500
Now, listen.

942
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,500
What is the word upon our mind?

943
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,500
Love.

944
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,500
That's amazing.

945
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,500
Truly, the suitor has brains as well as looks.

946
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,500
Question three.

947
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,500
There are two numbers on our mind.

948
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,500
What do they add up to?

949
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,500
Answer carefully for it.

950
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,500
Could unlock your princess's heart.

951
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,500
21.

952
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,500
Oh.

953
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,500
Was that right, too?

954
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,500
Oh, no.

955
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,500
It was 22.

956
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,500
My heart is heavy.

957
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,500
For chance, we should have said it was correct.

958
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,500
He was rather cute.

959
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,500
Was he not just her?

960
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,500
It's your turn now, stinky.

961
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,500
Well, I suppose that even half of Snortiles

962
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,500
would be something.

963
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,500
Think she'll ever get her memory back?

964
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,500
Of course she will.

965
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,500
This is not our idea of a suitor.

966
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,500
His heart is aching for you, royal highness.

967
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,500
Ah, let it ache.

968
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,500
Oh, alright.

969
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,500
I'll give him a chance.

970
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,500
Here is a question number one.

971
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,500
What is the number we are thinking of?

972
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
Well, of all our stupid questions.

973
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,500
We haven't all day.

974
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,500
Oh, well, oh.

975
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,500
For.

976
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,500
Indeed not.

977
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,500
It is 3,598,765.

978
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,500
Begone out.

979
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,500
Please, Snortiles, let's up there.

980
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,500
What room is up with his hands?

981
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,500
It's not fair, right?

982
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,500
Go home.

983
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,500
I'll give you another one I want after.

984
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,500
Oh, what a rude suitor.

985
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,500
We are no longer in the mood for royal marriage, jester.

986
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,500
At least not today.

987
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,500
A wise decision.

988
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,500
Oh, princess of the lonely mountains.

989
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,500
They will be prostrated with grief,

990
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,500
but bid the other suitors to go home.

991
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,500
Do not let them beg.

992
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,500
We would not like that.

993
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,500
Very well, your royal highness.

994
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,500
Do it kindly.

995
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,500
We wish them no pain at all.

996
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,500
From this day on, we shall devote ourselves

997
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,500
to good works and to the well-being of our people.

998
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,500
Oh.

999
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,500
You, I didn't want to marry you anyway.

1000
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,500
Wonder what Snort-Mayton's up to now?

1001
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,500
Upstairs thinking.

1002
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,500
She says she'll devote her life to good works.

1003
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,500
Works, what works?

1004
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,500
I don't know, but she probably wants to be remembered

1005
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,500
in the history books.

1006
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,500
The princess who was adored by her subjects.

1007
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,500
Oh, she's coming down.

1008
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,500
Your royal highness.

1009
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,500
May I assist you?

1010
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,500
Send the net to us.

1011
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,500
She is on an errand, your highness.

1012
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,500
Then have someone else make soup?

1013
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,500
Nursing, but not too rich.

1014
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,500
Soup, highness?

1015
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,500
Yes, indeed.

1016
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,500
And then we shall take it to our poor subjects ourselves.

1017
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,500
What kind of soup?

1018
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,500
We don't know.

1019
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,500
We eat.

1020
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,500
We don't cook.

1021
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,500
The poor will be happy with anything brought

1022
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,500
by the princess herself.

1023
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,500
Now hurry, man.

1024
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,500
Be quick about it.

1025
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,500
No, she wants some soup.

1026
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,500
This will be ample.

1027
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,500
The poor do not eat much.

1028
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,500
It would only make the meal.

1029
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,500
I don't know anyone poor around here, your majesty.

1030
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,500
Nonsense.

1031
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:29,500
One, two, one, two, one.

1032
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,500
Greetings, jester.

1033
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,500
What now?

1034
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,500
We're taking soup to the poor.

1035
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,500
Made with our own regal fingers.

1036
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,500
Do you know where they are, jester?

1037
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,500
Your fingers?

1038
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,500
Oh, I know.

1039
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,500
Good.

1040
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Wonderful.

1041
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,500
Take us to them now.

1042
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,500
They will be so grateful.

1043
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,500
You bet, princess.

1044
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,500
That house there.

1045
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,500
Oh, yes.

1046
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:08,500
It's nice to know that the poor and my kingdom are so well off.

1047
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,500
Oh, you, please come over here.

1048
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,500
Hmm?

1049
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,500
Will you?

1050
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,500
I'm the princess of Lonely Mountain.

1051
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,500
Princess?

1052
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,500
Oh, what moment you're all highness.

1053
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,500
Do not keep us waiting.

1054
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,500
We have a lot to do.

1055
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,500
I'm coming.

1056
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,500
I'm coming.

1057
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,500
Forgive me, you're all highness.

1058
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,500
I had no idea you were...

1059
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,500
My, my, smart maiden.

1060
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,500
That common name again?

1061
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,500
We are princess.

1062
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,500
Handle sticks.

1063
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,500
You're not right in the head coming here bothering your elders

1064
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,500
and betters like this.

1065
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,500
My betters?

1066
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,500
Oh, are you the queen then?

1067
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,500
Hmm?

1068
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,500
I am Mrs. Philly jog.

1069
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,500
Now what do you want?

1070
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,500
You're just fulfilling our royal duty bringing soup to the poor.

1071
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:08,500
Giving cheer to those less fortunate that ourselves.

1072
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,500
Here my good woman.

1073
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,500
Now if you just...

1074
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,500
Oh, there you call me poor.

1075
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,500
You who doesn't have a stitch of clothing to your name.

1076
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:20,500
Oh, the rich aroma of the soup must have overcome you, Mrs. Philly jog.

1077
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,500
Ah!

1078
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,500
Eat it yourself, your majesty.

1079
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,500
Ah!

1080
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,500
This is how I treason.

1081
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,500
Send for the guard.

1082
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,500
Take her to the tower.

1083
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,500
Hahaha!

1084
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,500
Oh!

1085
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,500
Oh!

1086
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,500
We cannot see.

1087
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,500
I'm afraid that serves you right, Snork maiden.

1088
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,500
Snork maiden!

1089
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,500
Don't use that common name.

1090
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,500
Help us.

1091
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,500
We cannot see.

1092
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,500
Please don't steal.

1093
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,500
You're all highness.

1094
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,500
Oh, hold a moment.

1095
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1096
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,500
I think it's stuck moment.

1097
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,500
Use the handle.

1098
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,500
Ah!

1099
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,500
Stop!

1100
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,500
You're hurting me.

1101
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,500
I'll get it on.

1102
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,500
Out of the way.

1103
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,500
Ah!

1104
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,500
Wait a minute.

1105
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,500
You can't break that soup, Turin.

1106
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,500
It's a family heirloom.

1107
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,500
And you mustn't hit Snork maiden on the head.

1108
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,500
You might hurt her.

1109
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,500
Stop fooling around and get this thing off, will you?

1110
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,500
All right.

1111
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,500
Oh, poor Snork maiden.

1112
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,500
You didn't have to get up that hard.

1113
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,500
Difficult to judge it with a broom.

1114
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,500
You never hit anyone wearing a scepter in before.

1115
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,500
Oh, you will write your royal highness.

1116
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,500
Oh, forgive us, your royal highness.

1117
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,500
Sprinkle some cold water over her face.

1118
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,500
No, she'd hate that, mama.

1119
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,500
Snork maiden.

1120
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,500
Oh, it's no good, moment.

1121
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,500
I don't think she'll wake up to anything, but your royal highness.

1122
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,500
Your highness.

1123
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,500
Your highness.

1124
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,500
Come out!

1125
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,500
Snork maiden.

1126
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,500
Oh, I'm so glad your royal highness is with us again.

1127
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,500
I hope your royal highness is not badly hurt.

1128
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,500
Oh.

1129
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,500
Where am I?

1130
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,500
In moment, Valley, of course, stupid. Where do you think?

1131
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,500
That's weird.

1132
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,500
I thought moment and I had gone for a walk in the lonely mountains.

1133
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,500
Didn't we, moment?

1134
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,500
Huh?

1135
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,500
Do you remember who I am, Snork maiden?

1136
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,500
Moment, what are you talking about, of course I do.

1137
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,500
And you don't think you're a princess anymore?

1138
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,500
Princess?

1139
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,500
Have you gone crazy or something?

1140
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,500
Or what princess?

1141
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,500
What do you mean, moment?

1142
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,500
Hooray!

1143
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,500
She's back to normal.

1144
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,500
Snork maiden's back to normal.

1145
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,500
Yes, it's nice to have you back again.

1146
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,500
Yes, it's wonderful.

1147
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,500
Welcome home.

1148
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,500
What is?

1149
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,500
What's wonderful?

1150
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,500
Have you all gone loopy or something?

1151
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,500
Never mind, Snork maiden.

1152
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,500
You bumped your head, that's all.

1153
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:44,500
And so Snork maiden's brief spell as a royal princess came to an end.

1154
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,500
Except that she was the only one who didn't remember it.

1155
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,500
But everyone else in movement valley breathed a sigh of relief.

1156
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:02,500
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

1157
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:10,500
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1158
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,500
They're always happy and always at play.

1159
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:21,500
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

1160
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:25,500
The movements.

1161
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:32,500
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

1162
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:40,500
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1163
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,500
They're always happy and always at play.

1164
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:50,500
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

1165
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,500
The movements.

1166
01:05:54,500 --> 01:06:00,500
The movements.

1167
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:22,500
Here they are for one and all.

1168
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,500
The movements are about to come.

1169
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,500
Come on and sit down here with me.

1170
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,500
They're for you on your TV.

1171
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,500
They are the movements.

1172
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,500
They are the movements.

1173
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,500
Come with me, give me your hand.

1174
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,500
I'll take you up to a movement land.

1175
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,500
You can fly just like a bird.

1176
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,500
Sing that song ever.

1177
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,500
There were the movements.

1178
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,500
There were the movements.

1179
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,500
There were the movements.

1180
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,500
There were the movements.

1181
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,500
There were the movements.

1182
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,500
There were the movements.

1183
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,500
There were the movements.

1184
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,500
There were the movements.

1185
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,500
There were the movements.

1186
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,500
There were the movements.

1187
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,500
There were the movements.

1188
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,500
There were the movements.

1189
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,500
There were the movements.

1190
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:32,500
There were the movements.

1191
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:38,500
There were the movements.

1192
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,500
There were the movements.

1193
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:46,500
There were the movements.

1194
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:56,500
With all the planets in outer space, there must be other forms of life different to that on Earth.

1195
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:01,500
We don't know what they look like because no one from here has ever seen them.

1196
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:13,500
However, we do know that they don't look like this because this is sniffed one of movement's friends.

1197
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,500
There were the movements.

1198
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:44,500
There were the movements.

1199
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:51,500
There were the movements.

1200
01:08:53,500 --> 01:09:00,500
So, it looks as though the rumor was right.

1201
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,500
Oh, what room was that?

1202
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,500
That we were about to be invaded by aliens from outer space.

1203
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,500
Oh, dear, do you mean that thing that was chasing me

1204
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,500
might have been one of them?

1205
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,500
Well, yes.

1206
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,500
I thought they were just after me.

1207
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,500
I wouldn't have thought you'd have been that important to them, sniff,

1208
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,500
but I suppose you never know, do you?

1209
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,500
It says here in this book that aliens from outer space

1210
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:31,500
are very civilized and peace-loving and would never want to invade us.

1211
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,500
It seemed as though they're quite happy where they are.

1212
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,500
I do, it's not a very scientific book.

1213
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:41,500
Well, it was definitely attacking me, Mom and Papa, I know it was.

1214
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:45,500
Well, it might have been a civilization from another planet, sniff.

1215
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,500
They were just hungry.

1216
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,500
Huh?

1217
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:53,500
Well, the inspector told me that he thought we were being invaded by aliens, and he shouldn't know.

1218
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,500
I'm sure he's exaggerating.

1219
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,500
I wonder what they look like.

1220
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,500
Why don't you come and help me in the garden?

1221
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,500
You never know, we might see one.

1222
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,500
Mama, wait for me!

1223
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,500
Mama, what's that?

1224
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,500
Well, I would say it's not a vegetable, that's for sure.

1225
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,500
It looks like a flying saucer.

1226
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,500
I wonder if there are any aliens in it.

1227
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,500
They might be heard, Mama.

1228
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,500
Let's have a look.

1229
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,500
I think there's something there.

1230
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,500
This looks odd.

1231
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,500
I wonder what it is.

1232
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,500
It's a bit like a radio, isn't it?

1233
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,500
Oh yeah, an alien radio.

1234
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,500
Do you think there's anyone in there moving?

1235
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,500
Anybody there?

1236
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,500
It seems to have been deserted.

1237
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,500
There's a funny noise coming from it.

1238
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,500
Well, it doesn't look to me like it could fly again.

1239
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,500
It could be repaired.

1240
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,500
You'd need to know about flying saucers.

1241
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,500
Papa could do it?

1242
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:25,500
I don't think flying saucers should make that sort of noise.

1243
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,500
Do you, woman?

1244
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,500
I don't think so, but I don't know very much about them.

1245
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,500
It does seem a bit odd, as if they've said it to be blown up

1246
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,500
so that no one would be able to steal it,

1247
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,500
because they want to keep the design a secret.

1248
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,500
Do you think it will?

1249
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,500
Oh!

1250
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:45,500
I'm not sure, Mama, but let's get away in case it does explode.

1251
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:49,500
That's why it's empty, but I wish it hadn't landed in the Asparagus patch.

1252
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,500
I'll take the radio with me.

1253
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,500
It won't be too long now, Mama.

1254
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,500
No, it won't.

1255
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,500
Good morning.

1256
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,500
It's vanished.

1257
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,500
Less my soul.

1258
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,500
Papa's book said they could be a very advanced life form.

1259
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:24,500
There's nothing to show it was ever here,

1260
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,500
except the hole in the ground, and this radio thing.

1261
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,500
Hmm.

1262
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,500
Me, is it a radio, Papa?

1263
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,500
I don't know. It looks a bit like one.

1264
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,500
Let's try pressing one of these buttons.

1265
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,500
The red one first, I think.

1266
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,500
Oh!

1267
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,500
Papa, where have you gone?

1268
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,500
Well, I'm right here.

1269
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,500
No, I wonder what happens if I press this one.

1270
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:10,500
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't see you either, dear.

1271
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,500
What?

1272
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,500
Oh, I see.

1273
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,500
So if you press the red button, you become invisible.

1274
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,500
What a fascinating machine.

1275
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,500
Papa, I think I'd rather see you, dear.

1276
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,500
Well, of course you would.

1277
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:32,500
Well, then let's try the yellow one.

1278
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,500
Can you see me now?

1279
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,500
No, Papa.

1280
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,500
Oh, that's odd.

1281
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,500
Do you want me to try, Papa?

1282
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,500
Please, Mama.

1283
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,500
There, that's it.

1284
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,500
Oh, Papa.

1285
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,500
Oh, that's a very dangerous machine.

1286
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,500
I don't want to disappear ever again.

1287
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,500
It's not a nice experience.

1288
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,500
No, dear. I didn't like you vanishing like that.

1289
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,500
Well, we must put it somewhere safe, Mama,

1290
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,500
where the children can't find it.

1291
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,500
Yes, dear.

1292
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,500
Mom!

1293
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,500
Snorke made it. What an earth's the matter.

1294
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,500
We found a strange creature.

1295
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,500
Strange creature?

1296
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,500
I think it's an alien.

1297
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,500
Does it look like a jellyfish?

1298
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,500
No, not at all.

1299
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,500
Little mice keeping an eye on it.

1300
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,500
Come on.

1301
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,500
Where are you going, Mum and Papa?

1302
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,500
Going me. Oh, no, Especial.

1303
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,500
Mum and Mama, hang on.

1304
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:42,500
I've got a few questions for you.

1305
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,500
Really, Inspector?

1306
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,500
I was told that a flying saucer

1307
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,500
had landed in your garden,

1308
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,500
but all I can see is a big hole.

1309
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,500
Where is it?

1310
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,500
What have you done with the saucer?

1311
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,500
Nothing.

1312
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,500
Well, where is it?

1313
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,500
It's not there now.

1314
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,500
It was there, but then it just vanished.

1315
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,500
Vanished?

1316
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,500
Yes, that's right.

1317
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,500
When you say vanished, you mean it flew away again?

1318
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,500
No, it just went woof.

1319
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,500
Gone.

1320
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,500
Moments are it, too.

1321
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,500
That's very odd.

1322
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,500
Yes, it was.

1323
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,500
Did you see any aliens on board by any chance?

1324
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,500
No.

1325
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,500
Are you telling me the truth?

1326
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:23,500
Of course.

1327
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,500
Why should I lie to you?

1328
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,500
Well, I can't.

1329
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,500
Think of any reason.

1330
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,500
I'm sorry, but it's upsetting

1331
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,500
aliens invading Mum and Valley.

1332
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,500
Yes, it is. Can we go now?

1333
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,500
Certainly.

1334
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,500
Where are you all going, by the way?

1335
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,500
Oh, only to the beach to collect shells.

1336
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,500
See you, Inspector.

1337
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,500
Collecting shells indeed,

1338
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:50,500
while I'm hunting for aliens.

1339
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,500
Ah! Over here!

1340
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,500
Ah!

1341
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,500
Ah!

1342
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:59,500
Ah!

1343
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,500
Ah, ah, you did the thing now.

1344
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,500
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

1345
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,500
Is that an alien?

1346
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,500
It certainly is, but not like it says in the book.

1347
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,500
Have you tried talking to it?

1348
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,340
Yes, but it wouldn't answer.

1349
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:14,860
Well, let me try.

1350
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:17,980
Are you from outer space?

1351
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:18,900
Go show Wattley.

1352
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,900
Wattley, do I see Dachydachadali nodding?

1353
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:24,980
Yes, it looks like a laugh and laugh a little bit.

1354
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:27,780
It looks like an alien child to me.

1355
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:29,020
More like a lamp.

1356
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:29,900
Poor thing.

1357
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,260
He must be hungry.

1358
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:32,860
Let's take him home.

1359
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:35,860
Yeah, well, we don't want the inspector to see him.

1360
01:16:41,500 --> 01:17:01,580
I'm sorry we can't understand you, but I'm sure you'll like milk, even if you don't

1361
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:02,580
speak English.

1362
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:06,580
Just try it and see.

1363
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,620
I think he's missing his home.

1364
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:14,140
Wherever in the universe that might be, I wonder where his parents are.

1365
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,620
He can't have come on his own.

1366
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:17,380
He seems far too little for that.

1367
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:18,860
Well, I don't know.

1368
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:23,060
But he's obviously missing them and he seems very unhappy.

1369
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:26,660
Do you think the inspector would really arrest him, Owen Papa?

1370
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:27,660
Possibly.

1371
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:29,820
He would think it is duty.

1372
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:32,140
Well that would be horrible of him.

1373
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:33,140
I know.

1374
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:34,140
It's inspector.

1375
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:40,140
Oh dear, he mustn't find him here.

1376
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:44,140
And he's got stinky with him.

1377
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,140
Oh, stinky.

1378
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:46,140
Well, that means trouble.

1379
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:47,140
Quick, he can hide in the kitchen.

1380
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:48,140
We got to do something.

1381
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,140
And quickly.

1382
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:50,140
I know what to do.

1383
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,140
What, Mama?

1384
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:52,140
We'll use the machine.

1385
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:53,140
Oh yeah.

1386
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,140
I know what to do.

1387
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:55,140
I know what to do.

1388
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:56,140
What, Mama?

1389
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,140
We'll use the machine.

1390
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:58,140
Oh yeah.

1391
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,140
I know what to do.

1392
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,140
I know what to do.

1393
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:01,140
I know what to do.

1394
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,140
I know what to do.

1395
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:12,140
We'll just keep him outside.

1396
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:22,140
Now him, this one, right?

1397
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:28,140
Oh dear.

1398
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:31,140
I think they're here!

1399
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:40,140
Oh, moving papa, I heard there was an alien here with what's happening?

1400
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:46,140
What's happened to me?

1401
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:48,140
Goodness, Inspector, you're very shiny.

1402
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:51,140
Oh dear, yes, how very, very strange.

1403
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:54,140
You look like a great big glow worm.

1404
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:57,140
An inspector in shining armor, you mean, Little My?

1405
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,140
That's just what I thought.

1406
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:03,140
You'll never need a lamp to be seen, Inspector.

1407
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:04,140
I like it.

1408
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,140
Criminals will be afraid of me.

1409
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:10,140
I can't wait to get back to the station and show the constables.

1410
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:12,140
Handy for reading in bed, too.

1411
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:15,140
Well, duty calls. Bye!

1412
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:26,140
What are you doing?

1413
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:28,140
I didn't know that the machine was still working.

1414
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:30,140
Oh, you can speak English.

1415
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,140
Of course I can.

1416
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:34,140
It's just that I need my language converted to help me to translate.

1417
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:36,140
And if you hadn't taken it from my ship and hidden it,

1418
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:38,140
I would have been able to talk sooner.

1419
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:41,140
That's a good way to learn, isn't it?

1420
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:42,140
Where are you going?

1421
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:44,140
To see that nice shiny man.

1422
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:46,140
But he'll arrest you!

1423
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:49,140
He came here looking for you, but he forgot about it

1424
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:51,140
when the machine started him glowing.

1425
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:55,140
No! Don't go there!

1426
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:57,140
Hey, why?

1427
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:59,140
I love that light of shimmer.

1428
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:03,140
It's just like, oh, it makes me feel really safe.

1429
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:06,140
Hello! Hello, Inspector.

1430
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:07,140
Yes, what is it?

1431
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,140
Take me with you.

1432
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,140
What?

1433
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:13,140
Well, you're so bright and beautiful Inspector.

1434
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:15,140
Oh, you think so?

1435
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:17,140
Hello, everyone, shimmers like that.

1436
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:18,140
Everyone.

1437
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:20,140
Well, that must be very nice for them.

1438
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:22,140
I want to pose you, please.

1439
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:26,140
I'm sorry, I'm too busy, but it was nice talking to you.

1440
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:29,140
You see, the aliens have invaded Moomin Valley

1441
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:31,140
and I must find them.

1442
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:34,140
Oh, I just remembered.

1443
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:38,140
I was tipped off that there was one of them in Moomin House.

1444
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,140
The inspector's coming back.

1445
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:49,140
What about the alien?

1446
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,140
He's running after him.

1447
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:52,140
Has he been handcuffed, Moomin?

1448
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:54,140
I don't think so.

1449
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:03,140
Open up in the name of the law, Moomin Papa.

1450
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:05,140
Well, certainly for you, Inspector.

1451
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:08,140
Come on in, you're very welcome.

1452
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:11,140
Moomin Papa, I have information from a reliable source,

1453
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:13,140
well, sort of reliable,

1454
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:16,140
that you have been hovering a fugitive.

1455
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:18,140
I'm sorry.

1456
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:22,140
In other words, I believe you have been hiding an alien here.

1457
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:24,140
Oh, Inspector, I don't think hiding is the right word.

1458
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:27,140
That suggests we are trying to keep something from you.

1459
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:28,140
Well, Mama?

1460
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:31,140
Would we do that, Inspector?

1461
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:37,140
Hmm, that stinky is tricked me again.

1462
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:39,140
Isn't it lucky he didn't find you?

1463
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:41,140
I want a nice inspector.

1464
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:43,140
Look, how many times must I tell you?

1465
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:45,140
He'll lock you up in an nasty cell.

1466
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:47,140
I like him. I want to see him.

1467
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:49,140
No, don't!

1468
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:02,140
Perhaps if we press the yellow button, he'll stop sharing.

1469
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:03,140
Good idea, Papa.

1470
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:04,140
Be quick, Mama.

1471
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:07,140
The yellow button.

1472
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,140
Here goes.

1473
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:18,140
You don't want him now that he stopped shining.

1474
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:20,140
Do you, little fella?

1475
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:21,140
No.

1476
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:23,140
Let's go home, man.

1477
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:27,140
Moomin Mama, come and look, we've saved the alien.

1478
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:33,140
Moomin Mama, the inspector's not glowing anymore.

1479
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:35,140
Isn't that something?

1480
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:36,140
Mama?

1481
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,140
Where are you?

1482
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:48,140
I'm here.

1483
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:50,140
Where?

1484
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:52,140
Where are you, Mama?

1485
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:55,140
Well, Mama?

1486
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:56,140
Right here.

1487
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:00,140
Mama?

1488
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:02,140
Oh, no, what's happened to you?

1489
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:03,140
I don't know.

1490
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:05,140
Probably that machine again.

1491
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:09,140
Oh, so it shrinks you as well as making you invisible, does it?

1492
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,140
Well, well.

1493
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:11,140
Oh, dear.

1494
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:13,140
I need an apron.

1495
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:16,140
Papa, can you get a handkerchief from my handbag?

1496
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:19,140
You really are quite small.

1497
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:23,140
But you look very cute, of course, Mama.

1498
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:25,140
Would you like to stay like that for a while?

1499
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:26,140
No, I would not.

1500
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:29,140
Push another button quickly before anyone sees me.

1501
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:31,140
Go on now, hurry up, Papa.

1502
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:32,140
Yeah.

1503
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:34,140
Oh, dear.

1504
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:35,140
What's up?

1505
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:38,140
The machine's gone.

1506
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,140
Oh.

1507
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:43,140
Hey, you.

1508
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:45,140
Tinky, give me back.

1509
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:46,140
Hey.

1510
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:47,140
Papa.

1511
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:48,140
Don't worry, Mama.

1512
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:50,140
I'll get it back.

1513
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:00,140
Oh, look at that way.

1514
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:01,140
Yeah.

1515
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:03,140
Stop him, Moments.

1516
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:04,140
Stop him.

1517
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,140
He stole the machine.

1518
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:07,140
We'll get him, Papa.

1519
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:11,140
Hey, sniff!

1520
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:12,140
Sniff!

1521
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,140
Don't let Stamkey get away!

1522
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:15,140
Right.

1523
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:19,140
Inventory!

1524
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:25,140
Please let me pass, Sniff.

1525
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:26,140
I'll give you a gold stopper and...

1526
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:27,140
A gold stopper?

1527
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:28,140
I mean, free.

1528
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:29,140
No, no, five.

1529
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:30,140
Five.

1530
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,140
No.

1531
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:33,140
Give me the machine, Stamkey.

1532
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:41,140
Where is it, Moments?

1533
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:43,140
What's happened to the machine?

1534
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:48,140
It's at the bottom of the river, Papa.

1535
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:51,140
Oh, poor Mama. Poor Mama.

1536
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:52,140
What's wrong with her?

1537
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:55,140
She needs the machine to get back to normal.

1538
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:57,140
Normal?

1539
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:07,140
Well, at least this is a chance to do some really fine embroidery.

1540
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,140
Don't worry, Mama.

1541
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:12,140
I promise we'll look after you.

1542
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:14,140
It's all right, Moomin.

1543
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:15,140
I'll manage.

1544
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:18,140
I'll have to get some smaller pots and pans, though.

1545
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:21,140
And we'll have to have smaller helpings.

1546
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:23,140
But that might be a bad idea.

1547
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:30,140
Oh.

1548
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:40,140
Oh.

1549
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,140
Here.

1550
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:52,140
Here.

1551
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,140
My house.

1552
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:54,140
Come for me.

1553
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:56,140
Mama.

1554
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:57,140
Papa.

1555
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:11,140
It's like the one we saw in the garden.

1556
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:36,140
Mama. Papa.

1557
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:38,540
Mama, oh.

1558
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:43,140
Oh, wait.

1559
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:02,640
Impealing.

1560
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,140
They are telling you of aren't they?

1561
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:06,960
I took a flying saucer.

1562
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:11,380
Look, would you ask your parents to make mama a normal size again?

1563
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:14,880
Yes, of course.

1564
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,540
Fiddler grassly grassy group!

1565
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:18,740
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1566
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,780
Oh, well, that's more like it.

1567
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:31,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, dear.

1568
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:34,380
Oh, oh, oh, no, stop, it's too much.

1569
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:37,580
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry, but could you try again, please?

1570
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:39,580
I know, but the more a mama there is, the better,

1571
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:42,220
but you're getting very large, very large indeed.

1572
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:43,220
You need to go.

1573
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:45,380
Uh-oh, oh, oh, oh.

1574
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,420
Oh.

1575
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:05,380
So Mumen Valley hadn't really been invaded at all,

1576
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:07,300
and the movements and the friends that found out

1577
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:09,140
where aliens really looked like.

1578
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:20,140
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.

1579
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:28,140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1580
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:32,140
They're always happy, and always at play.

1581
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:38,140
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

1582
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:50,140
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.

1583
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:57,140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1584
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:01,140
They're always happy, and always at play.

1585
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:07,140
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

1586
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:12,140
The movements.

1587
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:18,140
The movements.

1588
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:40,140
Here they are for one and all.

1589
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:46,140
The movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

1590
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:51,140
They're for you on your TV, they are the movements.

1591
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:54,140
They are the movements.

1592
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:57,140
So come with me, give me your hand.

1593
01:29:57,140 --> 01:30:00,140
I'll take you up to a moment land.

1594
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:05,140
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever.

1595
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:08,140
There were the movements.

1596
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:11,140
There were the movements.

1597
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:14,140
There were the movements.

1598
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:19,140
There were the movements.

1599
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:24,140
There were the movements.

1600
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:29,140
There were the movements.

1601
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:34,140
There were the movements.

1602
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:39,140
There were the movements.

1603
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:44,140
There were the movements.

1604
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:49,140
There were the movements.

1605
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:57,140
There were the movements.

1606
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:19,140
The movements.

1607
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:27,140
The movements.

1608
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:34,140
Mumen Valley is enjoying another still peaceful summer's day.

1609
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:38,140
However, this lazy lifestyle, no matter how pleasant it might be,

1610
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:43,140
does not suit everyone.

1611
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:45,140
Yes.

1612
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:48,140
Would you like a cup of coffee, dear?

1613
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:51,140
Yes, I think I need one, Mama.

1614
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:54,140
Oh, dear, is it your memoirs?

1615
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:55,140
I'm stuck.

1616
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:57,140
Ah, can I help?

1617
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:59,140
How can I create in this?

1618
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:00,140
In what?

1619
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:02,140
In this sleepy atmosphere.

1620
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:04,140
I've also come to a boring part.

1621
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:05,140
When was that?

1622
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:07,140
The time I wrote poems.

1623
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:10,140
Were they any good?

1624
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:11,140
No.

1625
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:14,140
Well, miss that bit out then.

1626
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:15,140
I can't.

1627
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:18,140
I must put it down for posterity.

1628
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:20,140
It is my duty.

1629
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:23,140
But how can I get inspiration here in this place

1630
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:26,140
when nothing ever happens, nothing ever happens at all?

1631
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:30,140
Oh, I think this means another adventure.

1632
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:36,140
Yes, Mama, but I need it to be big, exciting, and frightening.

1633
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:40,140
Mama, what's the matter?

1634
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,140
Are you all right?

1635
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:44,140
Your father says that because nothing ever happens here,

1636
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:45,140
he can't write.

1637
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:48,140
So I'm looking for an adventure for him.

1638
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:49,140
Can you think of anything?

1639
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:52,140
He wants it to be big, exciting, and frightening.

1640
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:54,140
Does he want something really exciting?

1641
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:55,140
Yes, dear.

1642
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:57,140
I'm afraid so.

1643
01:32:57,140 --> 01:33:00,140
I think I could manage that.

1644
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:12,140
That looks like the footprint of a huge monster.

1645
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:26,140
Oh, it's a good feeling giving others a bit of excitement.

1646
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:35,140
Just a couple more.

1647
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:41,140
I'm praised.

1648
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:45,140
The booboo I don't have to do modest work very often.

1649
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:50,140
Phew, that was harder than I thought.

1650
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:54,140
Oi, sleepy hands.

1651
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:56,140
Wake up, everybody.

1652
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:59,140
Mom and Papa, quickly get up.

1653
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:01,140
Mom and Mama, a monster.

1654
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:04,140
You've been visited by a monster.

1655
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:06,140
Wake up before you eat and alive.

1656
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:09,140
Come on, hurry, hurry.

1657
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:13,140
I want huge tracks.

1658
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:18,140
That should keep them guessing for a while.

1659
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:23,140
Hmm, it could be a monster from the depths of the ocean.

1660
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:25,140
Something's not right here.

1661
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:28,140
Don't you think it's a bit odd that it came directly to Moome House?

1662
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:30,140
Well, look at the footsteps.

1663
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:32,140
They go in a straight line.

1664
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:38,140
Someone must have told it to go to Moome House.

1665
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:40,140
And they're only going one way.

1666
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:43,140
Look, there are tiny footsteps going back to the sea.

1667
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:46,140
Oh, Mama, the monster must still be here then.

1668
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:49,140
Oh, well, not necessarily.

1669
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:52,140
Retracing one's own footsteps is the sign of an advanced intelligence.

1670
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:55,140
Stepping back exactly the way you came.

1671
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:58,140
The tough question is, why would the monster do that?

1672
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:02,140
One is led to believe that it wants us to think it's still here.

1673
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:06,140
Well, in fact, it has gone back to wherever it came from.

1674
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:09,140
Fatal battle is my dear mother, would say.

1675
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:12,140
But why would it want us to think that, Papa?

1676
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:14,140
It's a spy.

1677
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:15,140
Oh, it's a spy.

1678
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:16,140
Something it shouldn't.

1679
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:20,140
It'd hardly be a good spy if we knew they have to sneak in and out.

1680
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:22,140
I think it's still here.

1681
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:23,140
I can feel it.

1682
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:25,140
You know what I mean?

1683
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:27,140
Perhaps tonight.

1684
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:29,140
Tonight?

1685
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,140
What about tonight?

1686
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:31,140
That's when they'll attack.

1687
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:33,140
It's gone back to give its report.

1688
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:35,140
How do you know that, Papa?

1689
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:40,140
Well, obviously, that's why it still wants us to believe it's here.

1690
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:41,140
Mama!

1691
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:42,140
Yes, what is it, Moome?

1692
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:44,140
Something terrible is going to happen.

1693
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:47,140
A monster is going to attack us tonight.

1694
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:49,140
And Papa's excited about it.

1695
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:50,140
Oh, good.

1696
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:52,140
That's nice for him.

1697
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:55,140
Hurry, everyone.

1698
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:58,140
I expect the monster will be here soon.

1699
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:04,140
Oh, poor.

1700
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:07,140
Now hold it still.

1701
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:11,140
This is going to be a good barricade, don't you think?

1702
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:14,140
We'd better make sure it's big enough.

1703
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:18,140
It's hardly any fun at all playing tricks on them.

1704
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:20,140
They're so gullible!

1705
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:25,140
If we catch the monster, we can sell it to a zoo.

1706
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:28,140
I'll handle the sale, of course.

1707
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:31,140
I'd rather tame it and keep it as a pet.

1708
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:35,140
Well, you could ride on it to go pigneking.

1709
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:40,140
Oh, no, no.

1710
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:52,140
All right, now for the moat.

1711
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:53,140
Here we go.

1712
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:56,140
I hope the well's got enough water in it.

1713
01:36:57,140 --> 01:37:00,140
It'll be able to swim in this, Papa.

1714
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:04,140
Yes, it'll remind you to the sea and keep it calm.

1715
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:06,140
This is fresh water, Papa.

1716
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:08,140
We'd better put some salt in it.

1717
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:10,140
Good idea, Moome.

1718
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:13,140
We'll plant some seaweed and put some rocks in too,

1719
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:15,140
and then it'll feel really at home.

1720
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:23,140
I wonder when it'll come.

1721
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:27,140
I don't know, but I can feel in my bones it'll be tonight.

1722
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:29,140
And we keep watching till it comes?

1723
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:31,140
Of course we will, constantly.

1724
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:35,140
What if it doesn't come until tomorrow night or the night after that?

1725
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:40,140
It might be a long wait, so we'll take it in turns and remember everybody.

1726
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:44,140
The safety of Moome in Valley relies upon our vigilance.

1727
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:46,140
We must be ready.

1728
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:50,140
Huh?

1729
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:07,140
Look at what those fools have done.

1730
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,140
It was worth all the trouble.

1731
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:14,140
Huh?

1732
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,140
Look, they put down food as bait.

1733
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:19,140
Moome and Papa must be worn out.

1734
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:22,140
Well, I'll take the food anyway.

1735
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:23,140
Carefully, does it?

1736
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:25,140
Don't want to wake up the guard.

1737
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:27,140
And this is great.

1738
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:33,140
I've managed to play a really good trick on the stupid moments,

1739
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:36,140
and they've given me a slap-up meal as well.

1740
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:38,140
Ah!

1741
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:42,140
Well, well, what's that?

1742
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:44,140
The monster's here.

1743
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:45,140
Shut the gate.

1744
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:49,140
Ah, there's the rope. Quickly.

1745
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:52,140
No, no.

1746
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:54,140
Stop it, stop it, everybody.

1747
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:55,140
To wash.

1748
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:00,140
No, it's only me.

1749
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:02,140
Make room. I'll get it.

1750
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:03,140
Oh, what is it?

1751
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:04,140
Oh, what is it?

1752
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:06,140
There's no monster only me.

1753
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:09,140
Please, it's me. It's me, Stinky.

1754
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:10,140
Stinky?

1755
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:12,140
Well, it sounds like Stinky.

1756
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:14,140
Be careful, everybody. It's a baby monster.

1757
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:17,140
Another monster, please help me.

1758
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:19,140
I made the footprints.

1759
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:22,140
You did. He's obviously lying. He's too small.

1760
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:24,140
Watch him, or he'll go get his daddy.

1761
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:26,140
No, please, I beg you.

1762
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:28,140
Ah, Moome and Papa.

1763
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:30,140
Oh, hello, Snuffkin.

1764
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:32,140
Why don't you let Stinky go? It really is him, you know.

1765
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:34,140
It is?

1766
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:37,140
Yes, it was Stinky.

1767
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:39,140
And he really did make those footprints.

1768
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:41,140
How do you know that, Snuffkin?

1769
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:46,140
I was fishing off the shore last night when I saw him digging the holes.

1770
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:49,140
The little rascal was at it for hours and hours.

1771
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:05,140
Why don't you come inside, Stinky?

1772
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:06,140
This is great.

1773
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:09,140
It was very good of you to make the footprints.

1774
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:11,140
Papa hasn't had so much fun at ages.

1775
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:15,140
I'm glad it was hard work and I lost all my hair, too.

1776
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:18,140
Well, mischief isn't always easy, you know.

1777
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:21,140
You can say that again. This is delicious.

1778
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:35,140
Papa!

1779
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:53,140
Papa, are you all right?

1780
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:55,140
Yes, thank you, Moome.

1781
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:04,140
Mama.

1782
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:05,140
Yes, dear?

1783
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:08,140
Shh, I've got something important to tell you.

1784
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:09,140
What is it, Papa?

1785
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:12,140
A secret in my mind is made up.

1786
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:13,140
Of course, dear.

1787
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:15,140
I'm going to run away on an adventure trip.

1788
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:17,140
That's nice for you.

1789
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:20,140
It's a trip without a destination full of mystery,

1790
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:23,140
hazards and hardships and you're coming to, Mama.

1791
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:25,140
Oh, splendid.

1792
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:28,140
Shall we take all the children or just move in?

1793
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:31,140
No, no children.

1794
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:34,140
That would be the same as here, only somewhere else.

1795
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:35,140
We'll run away.

1796
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:37,140
Run away, Moome and Papa?

1797
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:39,140
I'll be an adventurer again,

1798
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:41,140
just as I was in my lost youth.

1799
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:44,140
And with you by my side, we'll have adventure romance.

1800
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:47,140
All we desire, the sun, the stars.

1801
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:50,140
But what about Moome? He'll be frantic.

1802
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:53,140
Whoa, then it's time he learned to stand on his own feet.

1803
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:55,140
Fan for himself. Become a man.

1804
01:41:55,140 --> 01:41:57,140
We can't protect him forever, you know.

1805
01:41:57,140 --> 01:42:00,140
He's big enough to be left by himself.

1806
01:42:09,140 --> 01:42:11,140
I'm on, Mama.

1807
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:15,140
Oh, just a moment, Papa.

1808
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:18,140
You can't take anything more with us.

1809
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:22,140
No, I know, but I forgot to write down where the sugar is.

1810
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:26,140
If they can't find it, they'll just have to do without.

1811
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,140
But then they won't be able to make cakes,

1812
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:30,140
and the tea will taste awful.

1813
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:32,140
Oh, and they'll never find this cinnamon on them.

1814
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:34,140
Where shall I leave it?

1815
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:37,140
Goodness, Mama, cinnamon, I ask you,

1816
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:40,140
when the unknown is calling to us.

1817
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:43,140
I should have gone on my own, indeed, I should.

1818
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:45,140
But then what good as an adventure, when you can't say who?

1819
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:47,140
That was a close shave to someone after us.

1820
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:49,140
Is there anything wrong, Papa?

1821
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:53,140
No, everything is fine, but we must leave before dawn.

1822
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:55,140
All right.

1823
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:57,140
We have a long way to go.

1824
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:59,140
How far and where?

1825
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:01,140
It's very dark, you know.

1826
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:02,140
Yes, isn't it?

1827
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:05,140
We'll just follow our feet, and they say this way.

1828
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:16,140
Oh, God.

1829
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:21,140
Good morning, Mama.

1830
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:24,140
Mama, where are you?

1831
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:27,140
What's the matter, Moomin?

1832
01:43:27,140 --> 01:43:29,140
My parents are missing.

1833
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:30,140
Are you sure?

1834
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:32,140
Of course, I'm sure.

1835
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:34,140
That's a bit of a problem, I'm getting hungry.

1836
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:35,140
I need my breakfast.

1837
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:37,140
I have to start the day with a good meal.

1838
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:38,140
I'm starving.

1839
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:40,140
Me, too.

1840
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:44,140
I'm starving.

1841
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:45,140
I'm starving.

1842
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:46,140
I'm starving.

1843
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:47,140
I'm starving.

1844
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:48,140
I'm starving.

1845
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:50,140
I'm starving.

1846
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:51,140
I'm starving.

1847
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:53,140
I'm starving.

1848
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:56,140
Don't worry, Moomin.

1849
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:59,140
I'm sure that Moomin, Mama and Moomin, Papa

1850
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:01,140
will be back home very soon.

1851
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:03,140
But where could they have gone to, Snuffkin?

1852
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:04,140
No idea.

1853
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:06,140
Have they left a note?

1854
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:08,140
Have you had your breakfast yet, Moomin?

1855
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:10,140
No, nothing.

1856
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:12,140
It's not the shame without Mama.

1857
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:14,140
Cheer up, Moomin.

1858
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:16,140
You can have this fish.

1859
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:20,140
And I'll come up to Moomin House and cook it especially for you, if you like.

1860
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:22,140
Thanks, Snuffkin.

1861
01:44:22,140 --> 01:44:24,140
But there are two cooks there already.

1862
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:27,140
Little May and Snuff are both trying to cook.

1863
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:29,140
A bit of this, a bit of that.

1864
01:44:29,140 --> 01:44:31,140
This is great.

1865
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:35,140
There's lots of delicious things I want to try out.

1866
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:38,140
Where are we, Papa?

1867
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:40,140
No idea, Mama.

1868
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:43,140
Too dark to see anything at all.

1869
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:45,140
We've been gone for hours.

1870
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:48,140
I think it should have been light by now.

1871
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:51,140
Oh dear, we have to face it.

1872
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:52,140
I'm afraid we're lost.

1873
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:54,140
I'm sorry, Mama, but there it is.

1874
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:56,140
Oh, what do you mean?

1875
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:59,140
Well, in the dark, we must have wandered into some caves.

1876
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:01,140
Who knows how many different tunnels we took.

1877
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:04,140
It could be weeks before we find our way.

1878
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:12,140
Little May, it's burning.

1879
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:13,140
Mind your own business.

1880
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:15,140
I might like burnt food.

1881
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:16,140
It's very nutritious.

1882
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:17,140
Watch your own cooking.

1883
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:20,140
Couldn't be any worse than the last lot you made for us.

1884
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:21,140
Ha!

1885
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:22,140
I wonder where Moomin is.

1886
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:23,140
He likes my food.

1887
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:24,140
I'll get him to try it.

1888
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:26,140
He can try mine first.

1889
01:45:26,140 --> 01:45:28,140
Now that I've practiced, it'll be perfect.

1890
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:31,140
Oh man, I've done something for you!

1891
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:43,140
Ah!

1892
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:49,140
Mama!

1893
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:02,140
Mama!

1894
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:05,140
Mama!

1895
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:20,140
Mama!

1896
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:30,140
What was that?

1897
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:40,140
Mom and Papa, wake up!

1898
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:43,140
Mom and Papa?

1899
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:50,140
Mom and Papa, wake up!

1900
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:05,140
Ooh!

1901
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:11,140
It tastes brackish.

1902
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:13,140
We must be quite near the sea.

1903
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:19,140
Mama!

1904
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:39,140
That's a big one.

1905
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:44,140
Gotcha!

1906
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:49,140
Moomin!

1907
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:50,140
Moomin!

1908
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:52,140
Where are you so far from home?

1909
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:53,140
Mama!

1910
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:54,140
At last!

1911
01:47:54,140 --> 01:47:56,140
Look, I've got a big fish!

1912
01:47:56,140 --> 01:47:58,140
Come and help me quickly!

1913
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:00,140
Don't let it get away!

1914
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:12,140
I've never seen such a big fish moving!

1915
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:14,140
Just wait till Papa sees it!

1916
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:17,140
Oh yes, Moomin Papa.

1917
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:18,140
This looks familiar.

1918
01:48:18,140 --> 01:48:20,140
It's Moomin Falley, isn't it?

1919
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:23,140
Of course it is, just outside the cave.

1920
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:24,140
Oh dear.

1921
01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:27,140
I'm afraid that your father will be a bit disappointed.

1922
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:28,140
Where is he then?

1923
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:29,140
Well...

1924
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:34,140
He's gone, looking for adventure.

1925
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:35,140
Adventure?

1926
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:36,140
Where?

1927
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:37,140
I don't really know.

1928
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:38,140
Somewhere.

1929
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:40,140
I could have gone with him.

1930
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:42,140
When's he coming home?

1931
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:45,140
I'm afraid I don't know that either.

1932
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:48,140
You know Papa tonight, tomorrow night.

1933
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:50,140
Next Christmas.

1934
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:53,140
Your guess is as good as mine, Moomin.

1935
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:54,140
Wow!

1936
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:57,140
I bet he's having a great adventure right now!

1937
01:48:57,140 --> 01:48:58,140
Hey, Mama!

1938
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:11,140
Mama!

1939
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:15,140
Hello, where are you?

1940
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:17,140
Oh.

1941
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:20,140
Oh, the cave dwellers must have her.

1942
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:22,140
Oh.

1943
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:23,140
Mama.

1944
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:32,140
Mama!

1945
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:33,140
Mama!

1946
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:34,140
Oh!

1947
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:36,140
Can you hear me?

1948
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:37,140
Oh!

1949
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:45,140
Goodness, the sea.

1950
01:49:54,140 --> 01:49:57,140
Oh, this looks like...

1951
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:59,140
Oh, it gets...

1952
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:01,140
Oh, dear.

1953
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:07,140
Terry, me, I don't...

1954
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:10,140
Oh, well...

1955
01:50:10,140 --> 01:50:12,140
Oh, my...

1956
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:14,140
Oh, you see?

1957
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:16,140
In my video...

1958
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:18,140
Here, this is it.

1959
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:20,140
Oh, yeah!

1960
01:50:20,140 --> 01:50:21,140
Of course!

1961
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:23,140
Helio, me.

1962
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:33,140
Oh, look! Look! It's Papa!

1963
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:36,140
Papa's back, everyone!

1964
01:50:36,140 --> 01:50:37,140
Uh-huh.

1965
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:39,140
Hi, Papa!

1966
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:42,140
Oh.

1967
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:45,140
Well, I'm back.

1968
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:47,140
I'm so pleased to see you again.

1969
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:49,140
Thank you, Mama.

1970
01:50:49,140 --> 01:50:52,140
Papa, how was your adventure?

1971
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:54,140
I'm unexpected.

1972
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:55,140
Yes, that's what I'd say.

1973
01:50:55,140 --> 01:50:57,140
Unexpected. Any food.

1974
01:50:57,140 --> 01:50:59,140
Oh, yes. You can try mine.

1975
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:00,140
First, Moomin, Papa.

1976
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:02,140
Oh, mine's the best. Try mine, Papa.

1977
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:04,140
Oh, that's good. I'm starving.

1978
01:51:04,140 --> 01:51:06,140
Tell us about your adventure.

1979
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:08,140
I love you.

1980
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:11,140
Were you an immortal danger? Did you eat any rats?

1981
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:12,140
Yeah, I am.

1982
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:13,140
Suppose there's adventure.

1983
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:16,140
I don't think Papa wants to talk about his adventure yet.

1984
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:18,140
Maybe later.

1985
01:51:18,140 --> 01:51:21,140
And that was the end of Mama and Papa's adventure.

1986
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:23,140
They didn't get far, but then...

1987
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:26,140
You don't have to sometimes for things to happen.

1988
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:29,140
Or at least for you to think they're happening.

1989
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:39,140
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

1990
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:47,140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1991
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:51,140
They're always happy and always at play.

1992
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:58,140
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

1993
01:51:58,140 --> 01:52:08,140
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

1994
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:16,140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1995
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:20,140
They're always happy and always at play.

1996
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:27,140
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

1997
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:31,140
The movements.

1998
01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:37,140
The movements.

1999
01:52:37,140 --> 01:52:43,140
The movements.

2000
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:13,140
The movements.

2001
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:17,140
The movements.

2002
01:53:17,140 --> 01:53:21,140
The movements.

2003
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:27,140
The movements.

2004
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:31,140
The movements.

2005
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:35,140
The movements.

2006
01:53:35,140 --> 01:53:39,140
The movements.

2007
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:43,140
The movements.

2008
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:47,140
The movements.

2009
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:53,140
The movements.

2010
01:53:53,140 --> 01:53:57,140
The movements.

2011
01:53:57,140 --> 01:54:01,140
The movements.

2012
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:05,140
The movements.

2013
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:15,140
The movements.

2014
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:31,140
It was the end of summer, but still every day seemed harder than the last.

2015
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:33,140
It was the end of telescending for the last.

2016
01:54:33,140 --> 01:54:37,140
Womenbowl had no rain for weeks and finally the river had dried up.

2017
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:41,140
Dad says this weather is a catastrophe snuffing.

2018
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:43,140
Oh no, ready.

2019
01:54:43,140 --> 01:54:45,140
But it is.

2020
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:47,140
He says this mountain valley will turn into a desert if it carries on.

2021
01:54:47,140 --> 01:54:49,140
I don't think that will happen.

2022
01:54:49,140 --> 01:54:52,140
Dad can't ever remember it so hot.

2023
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:54,140
Even the river has dried up.

2024
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:56,140
No, that does worry me.

2025
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:58,140
I can't fish anymore.

2026
01:54:58,140 --> 01:55:02,260
When all my travels, I found that droughts like this are always followed by a real heavy

2027
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:03,260
downpour.

2028
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:10,500
Well, it's too hot for me anyway.

2029
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:23,620
Oh, it's so hot, I can't think.

2030
01:55:23,620 --> 01:55:52,220
Well, well, even the weeds are wilting.

2031
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:54,500
The sea never dries up, does it?

2032
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:57,220
Of course not stupid, wherever the fish go.

2033
01:55:57,220 --> 01:56:02,220
I'm going swimming.

2034
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:31,500
Here you are.

2035
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:44,540
It's loose.

2036
01:56:44,540 --> 01:57:14,540
I'm going to have to go back to my old house, but I'm not going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house, I'm going to have to go back to my old house,

2037
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:22,280
Look at this.

2038
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:32,360
Like a tile, like a tile.

2039
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:42,360
Oh, that hurt. What's this stupid box doing here? I think it's floated from foreign lands.

2040
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:47,360
What's it got in it? Perhaps it's full of priceless jewels.

2041
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:50,360
No, it wouldn't float so high in the water if it was.

2042
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:55,360
A tiara packed in wood shavings. I could use a new comb, too.

2043
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:58,360
What have you found you, too, a treasure?

2044
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:02,360
No, we don't think so. It's not heavy enough. But you never know, Snork Maiden.

2045
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:04,360
Let's open it and see.

2046
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:07,360
Come on, Slay's. Push me a shore.

2047
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:16,360
Perhaps it's gold nuggets in here. Our diamonds are something to eat.

2048
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:30,360
What is this?

2049
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:33,360
Seeds, maybe.

2050
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:34,360
What sort of seeds?

2051
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:42,360
Hmm. Well, at first glance, I'd say they might be tropical plants.

2052
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:43,360
Oh, really, Mr. Hemie.

2053
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:45,360
What plants are tropical?

2054
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:47,360
Well, species like banana are mangoes.

2055
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:50,360
Banana? And mangoes.

2056
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:56,360
Well, I haven't done a lot of research on tropical plants, so I can't be sure, but they do look like it.

2057
01:58:56,360 --> 01:58:59,360
I know, Mama. Why don't we plant them?

2058
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:00,360
Good idea, Moomin.

2059
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:05,360
The thing is, we don't have a tropical climate. I'm afraid they wouldn't grow here at all.

2060
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:07,360
Let's plant them, shall we?

2061
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:10,360
They won't bear any fruit, so don't get too excited.

2062
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:14,360
Oh, well, it seems tropical enough to me, Mr. Hemie.

2063
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:16,360
At least we can try, can't we?

2064
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:19,360
I want to see what papaya looks like and ugly fruit.

2065
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:22,360
I want mangoes growing all around my bedroom window.

2066
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:24,360
Let's plant them, shall we?

2067
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:32,360
I tell you, they're strictly tropical. They won't take root at all.

2068
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:57,360
It certainly seems that Mama is enjoying herself, Mr. Hemie.

2069
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:59,360
I don't think it'll be much use.

2070
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:03,360
Perhaps not, but it's so worth the farm and trying.

2071
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:07,360
Imagine Moomin Valley, a tropical jungle.

2072
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:13,360
Oh, Mr. Hemie, do you think these seeds will grow into real fruit trees?

2073
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:23,360
Let me see. What have you got here, little my? I could very well be mistaken, but I think this one is a mango seed.

2074
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:25,360
Thanks.

2075
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:28,360
And why do you want to know, little my?

2076
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:35,360
Because I'm only growing fruit. I want to be sure I'm not planting stupid orchids or passion flowers or something.

2077
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:43,360
Mr. Hemie, can you tell me which one of these is banana?

2078
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:46,360
I'm not really too sure, but I think it's this one.

2079
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:49,360
You want to grow an orchid too, snorkemaiden?

2080
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:55,360
No, I just want to plant a banana tree in a really special place. It's Moomin's favorite fruit.

2081
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:03,360
I think she'll be disappointed bananas won't grow here.

2082
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:10,360
This weather doesn't belong here either. If it gets any hotter, I'll melt. I can't wait for dusk so it'll cool down a bit.

2083
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:25,360
Isn't it wonderful to go to sleep looking at the stars?

2084
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:28,360
And it's not so hot anymore.

2085
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:30,360
I'll sleep like a log tonight.

2086
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:33,360
You always do, don't you, little my?

2087
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:36,360
Well, sleep like an extra heavy log, then.

2088
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:46,360
Snorkemaiden, why don't you sleep under that tree with Moomin and little my?

2089
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:51,360
Oh, because I can't see the stars from there and it makes me feel romantic looking at them.

2090
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:55,360
But you're going to get very wet if it starts raining in the night.

2091
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:57,360
You're joking, surely, Mama.

2092
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:59,360
Not at all.

2093
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:04,360
But it hasn't rained for ages, and there aren't any clouds or anything. Just stars.

2094
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:08,360
All the toothpicks fell on the floor, and that's a sure sign of rain.

2095
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:12,360
Snorkemaiden won't mind if she gets all wet, Moomin, Mama. That should be happy.

2096
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:15,360
Who? Why is that?

2097
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:21,360
Because then she'll know that the special tree will start growing, and that's very important to her.

2098
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:27,360
That's true. Good night, everyone. I hope you sleep well.

2099
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:37,360
Good night, everybody.

2100
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:48,360
Good night, Moomin.

2101
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:50,360
Good night, don't snore.

2102
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:08,360
It's too hot to sleep.

2103
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:12,360
Why don't you sleep outside like the children?

2104
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:14,360
I think I will.

2105
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:26,360
A thunderstorm.

2106
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:29,360
I told you the toothpicks are never wrong.

2107
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:39,360
Oh!

2108
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:41,360
Hey, it's raining, Moomin!

2109
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:44,360
Wake up, Moomin!

2110
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:46,360
Oh, is it morning?

2111
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:48,360
The sun's really bright.

2112
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:50,360
No, it's raining.

2113
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:52,360
Rainy?

2114
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:54,360
Look at that.

2115
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:57,360
You look, I'm getting wet, I'm going inside.

2116
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:59,360
So Mama was right about the rain.

2117
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:02,360
Hey, Snorkemaiden!

2118
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:04,360
Doesn't she look sweet?

2119
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:06,360
Snorkemaiden!

2120
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:07,360
Is it raining?

2121
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:08,360
That's very clever.

2122
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:11,360
Your mother knows everything doesn't she?

2123
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:12,360
She does.

2124
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:14,360
Now let's get into the house.

2125
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:17,360
Not yet. I want to feel the rain on my face.

2126
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:19,360
It's been so long.

2127
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:23,360
Ah!

2128
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:26,360
Do you want to feel it much longer?

2129
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,360
Oh!

2130
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:15,360
It's the raining.

2131
02:05:22,360 --> 02:05:23,360
Mangoes!

2132
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:25,360
That's impossible!

2133
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:27,360
Gosh!

2134
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:31,360
By my tail, a jungle!

2135
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:33,360
That's a tropical jungle!

2136
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:34,360
Wake up!

2137
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:36,360
Wake up, you two!

2138
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:38,360
There's a jungle outside!

2139
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:40,360
We've planted a jungle!

2140
02:05:40,360 --> 02:05:41,360
A jungle?

2141
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:07,360
Your right moment, those seeds have not only sprouted.

2142
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,360
I know, they're big trees.

2143
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:12,360
I've never known trees to grow like that.

2144
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:13,360
That's...

2145
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:15,360
I think I'll go and play Tarzan.

2146
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:20,360
I wish my lettuce seeds would do that moment, Papa.

2147
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:22,360
There's magic here somewhere, Mama.

2148
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:24,360
Let's go and explore.

2149
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:30,360
That's rain drumming on the campus.

2150
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:36,360
It must be.

2151
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:38,360
Snuffkin!

2152
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,360
What a nurse all this!

2153
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:49,360
Well, we found a crate of tropical seeds and planted them last night.

2154
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:52,360
And this morning, while you can see it's like magic.

2155
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:54,360
It's fantastic.

2156
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:57,360
I know. We can go on a safari.

2157
02:06:58,360 --> 02:07:00,360
I've seen nothing like it.

2158
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:08,360
What kind of flower is this?

2159
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:10,360
It looks like an orchid to me.

2160
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:13,360
This is a real tropical jungle, isn't it, Snuffkin?

2161
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:14,360
Not quite.

2162
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:15,360
What do you mean?

2163
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:19,360
Well, Moomin, a real jungle would have wild animals in it, wouldn't it?

2164
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:21,360
Oh, yeah, like tigers and snakes.

2165
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:26,360
This is more of a tropical botanical garden, I suppose.

2166
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:30,360
That's Moomin's little mind.

2167
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:32,360
He can have the peel.

2168
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:43,360
This is a life.

2169
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:48,360
Stop, little mind.

2170
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:50,360
Well, well.

2171
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:55,360
What are you looking for, dear?

2172
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:57,360
My solar topi.

2173
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:58,360
You what?

2174
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:01,360
My sun helmet, I can't go into the jungle without it.

2175
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:03,360
I didn't know you had one.

2176
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:06,360
I used it for a fancy dress party once, I know.

2177
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:08,360
I put it in a box somewhere.

2178
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:10,360
Oh, here it is.

2179
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:12,360
Very dashing, dear.

2180
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:13,360
I thought so too.

2181
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:15,360
Oh, I know.

2182
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:23,360
Oh!

2183
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:25,360
Oh!

2184
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:34,360
Splendid protection is hat.

2185
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:41,360
Papa?

2186
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:43,360
What in earth are you doing?

2187
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:46,360
I want to get into the cello.

2188
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:47,360
What for?

2189
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:49,360
To get my gun.

2190
02:08:49,360 --> 02:08:50,360
Your gun?

2191
02:08:50,360 --> 02:08:54,360
Only fools venture into the jungle without a proper gun.

2192
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:56,360
I don't think you need a gun, Papa.

2193
02:08:56,360 --> 02:08:58,360
And why not?

2194
02:08:58,360 --> 02:09:00,360
Because there aren't any wild animals.

2195
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:04,360
Well, one of the seas might have been an egg or something.

2196
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:06,360
Look at these, for instance.

2197
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:08,360
They look very animal.

2198
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:12,360
Very odd animals.

2199
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:14,360
More of an odd plant, I think.

2200
02:09:14,360 --> 02:09:15,360
I'd stay away from them.

2201
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:17,360
They could be very dangerous.

2202
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:19,360
Look, they've got eyes.

2203
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:21,360
I think they're man-eating plants.

2204
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:23,360
Man-eating.

2205
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:25,360
Hey, stop that.

2206
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:27,360
Stop that.

2207
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:29,360
Help!

2208
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:31,360
They're trying to eat me.

2209
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:33,360
But they want to feed me to that young.

2210
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:35,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, help me.

2211
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:37,360
Help!

2212
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:39,360
They're tearing my tail up.

2213
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:43,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2214
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:45,360
Oh, no, oh, dear.

2215
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:47,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2216
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:54,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2217
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:55,200
Oh, oh.

2218
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,400
Uh-oh.

2219
02:09:56,400 --> 02:10:00,840
Well, done, my little Maya just saved my life.

2220
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:03,160
Well, I saved your tail anyway.

2221
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:04,880
Oh, oh.

2222
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:05,880
Huh.

2223
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:08,540
Look, oh, oh.

2224
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:11,540
Get something to jam this door shut.

2225
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:12,540
Come on.

2226
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:13,520
Hurry.

2227
02:10:15,120 --> 02:10:16,340
Oh, oh.

2228
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:18,340
I don't know. You can't hold on to much longer.

2229
02:10:36,340 --> 02:10:38,340
That should keep them in now, shouldn't it?

2230
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:41,340
Well, I don't think they could push their way through that lot.

2231
02:10:41,340 --> 02:10:43,340
They had a very strong grip on my tail.

2232
02:10:43,340 --> 02:10:45,340
He mustn't underestimate them.

2233
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:46,340
Anything wrong?

2234
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:49,340
You bet the seller's full of man-eating plants

2235
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:51,340
trying to gobble up moment papa.

2236
02:10:51,340 --> 02:10:54,340
Oh, my goodness.

2237
02:10:54,340 --> 02:10:55,340
What's the matter?

2238
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:58,340
You can get straight from the seller into the kitchen.

2239
02:10:58,340 --> 02:11:01,340
What? Oh, no, mama.

2240
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:02,340
Oh.

2241
02:11:15,340 --> 02:11:17,340
Oh, hello.

2242
02:11:17,340 --> 02:11:19,340
Cue, we got here just in time.

2243
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:22,340
Whatever's the matter with you, are you all playing Tarzan?

2244
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:23,340
Oh, no, mama.

2245
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:27,340
I'm making grandmas if you ever get a tropical fruit recipe.

2246
02:11:27,340 --> 02:11:30,340
And perhaps now it's rained I can wash this dirty floor.

2247
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:39,340
Ah, by the great bumble, I don't believe this a tropical rainforest.

2248
02:11:39,340 --> 02:11:44,340
Ah, ah, a transcendentia, megaloids.

2249
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:47,340
And yes, a dyspepsia, flora, and munda.

2250
02:11:47,340 --> 02:11:52,340
Goodness me, I can collect a whole tropical hermoreum right here in Mum and Valley.

2251
02:11:52,340 --> 02:11:56,340
I travel. That's what I need. I'll get one from the Mormons.

2252
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:06,340
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

2253
02:12:06,340 --> 02:12:08,340
Must say they're not the tiniest family.

2254
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:11,340
I'll have to move this.

2255
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:14,340
Oh, this old furniture.

2256
02:12:26,340 --> 02:12:28,340
Do I look that funny?

2257
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:29,340
No, you look great.

2258
02:12:29,340 --> 02:12:32,340
Maybe you and Tarzan have different muscles.

2259
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:34,340
Me, Tarzan.

2260
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:35,340
You, Jay.

2261
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:36,340
Oh, oh.

2262
02:12:36,340 --> 02:12:38,340
Oh, here we go.

2263
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:40,340
Me, get out with Army Six.

2264
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:43,340
Ah!

2265
02:12:43,340 --> 02:12:44,340
Ah, help!

2266
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:47,340
I've got man-eating plants after this.

2267
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:49,340
What? They must have come out.

2268
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:51,340
Oh.

2269
02:12:55,340 --> 02:12:57,340
Uh-oh.

2270
02:13:00,340 --> 02:13:03,340
They were in the cellar.

2271
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:05,340
Did you open the door, Mr. Hamilon?

2272
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:08,340
Well, yes, I wanted to borrow a trowel.

2273
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:11,340
Mr. Hamilon, you know all about plants.

2274
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:13,340
Do you have any idea how we can get rid of them?

2275
02:13:13,340 --> 02:13:15,340
They're man-eaters, you know?

2276
02:13:15,340 --> 02:13:17,340
Can't rid of them.

2277
02:13:17,340 --> 02:13:19,340
Well, let's see.

2278
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:21,340
We are in a bit of a fix.

2279
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:24,340
I have heard that they have react to music.

2280
02:13:24,340 --> 02:13:25,340
Music.

2281
02:13:26,340 --> 02:13:27,340
Music.

2282
02:13:27,340 --> 02:13:30,340
Snuffkin, you could play your harmonica.

2283
02:13:30,340 --> 02:13:31,340
Hmm.

2284
02:13:48,340 --> 02:13:50,340
Look, they've started dancing.

2285
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:52,340
Keep it up, Snuffkin.

2286
02:13:55,340 --> 02:13:56,340
Hmm.

2287
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:11,340
What will they do if he stops playing?

2288
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:13,340
I really don't know.

2289
02:14:19,340 --> 02:14:21,340
Oh, that's this.

2290
02:14:21,340 --> 02:14:22,340
Oh.

2291
02:14:26,340 --> 02:14:27,340
Oh.

2292
02:14:31,340 --> 02:14:35,340
They're rather sweet when they don't try to eat you.

2293
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:38,340
And that was how a tropical jungle grew

2294
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:41,340
and surrounded movement house in one night.

2295
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:42,340
Is it going to stay?

2296
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:44,340
And for how long?

2297
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:50,340
And what will the man-eating plants do if Snuffkin stops playing?

2298
02:14:51,340 --> 02:14:59,340
They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.

2299
02:14:59,340 --> 02:15:06,340
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2300
02:15:06,340 --> 02:15:10,340
They're always happy and always at play.

2301
02:15:10,340 --> 02:15:14,340
The movements are having fun day after day.

2302
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:21,340
They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.

2303
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:28,340
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2304
02:15:28,340 --> 02:15:32,340
They're always happy and always at play.

2305
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:37,340
The movements are having fun day after day.

2306
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:40,340
The movements are having fun day after day.

2307
02:15:40,340 --> 02:15:44,340
The movements are having fun day after day.

2308
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:47,340
The movements.

2309
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:51,340
The movements.

2310
02:15:51,340 --> 02:15:57,340
The movements.

2311
02:16:10,340 --> 02:16:19,340
Here they are for one and all.

2312
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:22,340
The movements are about to come.

2313
02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:25,340
Come on and sit down here with me.

2314
02:16:25,340 --> 02:16:27,340
They're here for you on your TV.

2315
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:30,340
They are the movements.

2316
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:33,340
They are the movements.

2317
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:36,340
So come with me, give me your hand.

2318
02:16:36,340 --> 02:16:39,340
I'll take you up to a movement land.

2319
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:42,340
You can fly just like a bird.

2320
02:16:42,340 --> 02:16:44,340
Sing that song ever.

2321
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:47,340
There were the movements.

2322
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:50,340
There were the movements.

2323
02:16:50,340 --> 02:16:53,340
There were the movements.

2324
02:16:53,340 --> 02:16:56,340
There were the movements.

2325
02:16:56,340 --> 02:16:59,340
There were the movements.

2326
02:16:59,340 --> 02:17:02,340
There were the movements.

2327
02:17:09,340 --> 02:17:39,340
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

2328
02:17:39,340 --> 02:18:09,340
The seeds that movement and his friends had found in a box that had been cast up on the beach had grown into a tropical forest. It was beautiful, but also dangerous, with man-eating plants kept at bay by snuffkin playing his harmonica. But for how long?

2329
02:18:09,340 --> 02:18:27,340
Oh dear. Oh! Snuffkin, don't stop playing your harmonica whatever you do or did they'll only get angry and attack us all over again. If I don't stop soon, I might never want to play again.

2330
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:38,340
Well, perhaps the music has made them more friendly. Be careful, Mr. Himmelon. Oh, don't worry.

2331
02:18:38,340 --> 02:18:48,340
Mr. Himmelon, look out!

2332
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:58,340
Huh? Ah, ah, ah! I warn him. I don't think the quickly snuffkin' play again.

2333
02:18:58,340 --> 02:18:59,340
Ah!

2334
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:02,340
Ah!

2335
02:19:02,340 --> 02:19:03,340
Ah!

2336
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:04,340
Ah!

2337
02:19:04,340 --> 02:19:05,340
Ah!

2338
02:19:05,340 --> 02:19:06,340
Ah!

2339
02:19:06,340 --> 02:19:07,340
Ah!

2340
02:19:07,340 --> 02:19:08,340
Ah!

2341
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:10,340
Ah!

2342
02:19:10,340 --> 02:19:12,340
Ah!

2343
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:14,340
Ah!

2344
02:19:14,340 --> 02:19:16,340
Ah!

2345
02:19:16,340 --> 02:19:17,340
Ah!

2346
02:19:17,340 --> 02:19:19,340
Ah!

2347
02:19:19,340 --> 02:19:21,340
Ah!

2348
02:19:21,340 --> 02:19:23,340
Ah!

2349
02:19:23,340 --> 02:19:27,340
Papa, we must make sure the trap door won't open again.

2350
02:19:27,340 --> 02:19:29,340
Ah, yes.

2351
02:19:29,340 --> 02:19:31,340
What's this about a trap door?

2352
02:19:31,340 --> 02:19:32,340
In the kitchen.

2353
02:19:32,340 --> 02:19:34,340
They almost got in before and attacked Mama.

2354
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:36,340
We reached her just in time.

2355
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:45,340
Ah, there they are.

2356
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:50,340
Ah!

2357
02:19:50,340 --> 02:19:52,340
Ah!

2358
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:54,340
Ah!

2359
02:19:54,340 --> 02:19:55,340
Ah!

2360
02:19:55,340 --> 02:19:56,340
Ah!

2361
02:19:56,340 --> 02:19:57,340
Ah!

2362
02:19:57,340 --> 02:19:58,340
Ah!

2363
02:19:58,340 --> 02:19:59,340
Ah!

2364
02:19:59,340 --> 02:20:00,340
Ah!

2365
02:20:00,340 --> 02:20:01,340
Ah!

2366
02:20:01,340 --> 02:20:02,340
Ah!

2367
02:20:02,340 --> 02:20:03,340
Ah!

2368
02:20:03,340 --> 02:20:04,340
Ah!

2369
02:20:04,340 --> 02:20:05,340
Ah!

2370
02:20:05,340 --> 02:20:06,340
Ah!

2371
02:20:06,340 --> 02:20:07,340
Ah!

2372
02:20:07,340 --> 02:20:08,340
Ah!

2373
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:09,340
Ah!

2374
02:20:09,340 --> 02:20:11,340
Ah!

2375
02:20:11,340 --> 02:20:12,340
Ah!

2376
02:20:12,340 --> 02:20:13,340
Ah!

2377
02:20:13,340 --> 02:20:14,340
Ah!

2378
02:20:14,340 --> 02:20:15,340
Ah!

2379
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:16,340
Ah!

2380
02:20:16,340 --> 02:20:17,340
Ah!

2381
02:20:17,340 --> 02:20:18,340
Ah!

2382
02:20:18,340 --> 02:20:19,340
Ah!

2383
02:20:19,340 --> 02:20:20,340
Ah!

2384
02:20:20,340 --> 02:20:21,340
I feel sorry for them.

2385
02:20:21,340 --> 02:20:23,340
It can be helpful, Snowfkin.

2386
02:20:23,340 --> 02:20:24,340
We'll let them out.

2387
02:20:24,340 --> 02:20:25,340
We'll be...

2388
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:26,340
It in a life.

2389
02:20:26,340 --> 02:20:31,340
It makes me feel very uncomfortable,

2390
02:20:31,340 --> 02:20:33,340
having man-eating plants under the floor.

2391
02:20:33,340 --> 02:20:35,340
Always keep a kettle of boiling water,

2392
02:20:35,340 --> 02:20:38,340
handy in case they break through.

2393
02:20:38,340 --> 02:20:41,340
The children are playing Tarzan.

2394
02:20:41,340 --> 02:20:43,340
They might as well,

2395
02:20:43,340 --> 02:20:45,340
seeing as they've got a jungle to play in.

2396
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:48,340
Still, planting those seeds might have been a terrible mistake.

2397
02:20:48,340 --> 02:20:51,340
Well, Mama, I'm very glad that you did.

2398
02:20:51,340 --> 02:20:53,340
Just think what I would have missed,

2399
02:20:53,340 --> 02:20:55,340
and movement value suddenly being full

2400
02:20:55,340 --> 02:20:57,340
of tropical plants is wonderful.

2401
02:20:57,340 --> 02:20:59,340
I'm not fond of traveling, as you know,

2402
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:02,340
and you've brought the plants to me.

2403
02:21:02,340 --> 02:21:04,340
Oh, the trees make it much cooler,

2404
02:21:04,340 --> 02:21:06,340
but those man-eaters,

2405
02:21:06,340 --> 02:21:08,340
who I could do without them.

2406
02:21:08,340 --> 02:21:09,340
Ah!

2407
02:21:09,340 --> 02:21:11,340
Ah!

2408
02:21:16,340 --> 02:21:18,340
You're just like Tarzan.

2409
02:21:18,340 --> 02:21:20,340
Tarzan loves Jane.

2410
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:22,340
Oh, what bliss!

2411
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:27,340
Stinky's over there.

2412
02:21:27,340 --> 02:21:28,340
Stinky!

2413
02:21:28,340 --> 02:21:31,340
Tarzan, teach Old Betty lesson.

2414
02:21:31,340 --> 02:21:33,340
Yaaah!

2415
02:21:36,340 --> 02:21:37,340
Ah!

2416
02:21:37,340 --> 02:21:38,340
Ah!

2417
02:21:44,340 --> 02:21:45,340
Oh!

2418
02:21:45,340 --> 02:21:46,340
Oh, dear!

2419
02:21:46,340 --> 02:21:49,340
Pretty stupid moment playing Tarzan

2420
02:21:49,340 --> 02:21:50,340
without wild animals.

2421
02:21:50,340 --> 02:21:52,340
Well, animals don't come from seeds.

2422
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:54,340
No, but you need them to have a real jungle.

2423
02:21:54,340 --> 02:21:56,340
I can get you some if you want.

2424
02:21:56,340 --> 02:21:57,340
Really?

2425
02:21:57,340 --> 02:21:59,340
I'll do anything for my friends.

2426
02:21:59,340 --> 02:22:01,340
That's very kind of you.

2427
02:22:01,340 --> 02:22:02,340
Not too wild, though.

2428
02:22:02,340 --> 02:22:05,340
No lions or tigers or anything.

2429
02:22:05,340 --> 02:22:07,340
Maybe, yet maybe chimpanzee.

2430
02:22:07,340 --> 02:22:10,340
I know exactly what you need.

2431
02:22:13,340 --> 02:22:15,340
Cheese.

2432
02:22:15,340 --> 02:22:17,340
Bread.

2433
02:22:17,340 --> 02:22:19,340
Ah!

2434
02:22:21,340 --> 02:22:23,340
What are you doing, Mama?

2435
02:22:23,340 --> 02:22:27,340
Well, I don't like the thought of all those man-eaters still in the cellar.

2436
02:22:27,340 --> 02:22:30,340
So your father and I are going to sleep in the bathhouse.

2437
02:22:30,340 --> 02:22:32,340
We'll sleep outdoors, too.

2438
02:22:32,340 --> 02:22:34,340
We've just built ourselves a hut.

2439
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:36,340
It's not made in a little mind, too.

2440
02:22:36,340 --> 02:22:38,340
Yes, there's plenty of room.

2441
02:22:38,340 --> 02:22:39,340
Oh, right.

2442
02:22:39,340 --> 02:22:42,340
So that only leaves Mr. Himmel and sleeping in the house.

2443
02:22:42,340 --> 02:22:45,340
And he still busy checking all the different plans.

2444
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:50,340
Mama, is everything ready?

2445
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:52,340
Oh, yes, dear.

2446
02:22:54,340 --> 02:22:56,340
Oh, I'm all ready.

2447
02:22:56,340 --> 02:22:58,340
Yes, we are, Mr. Himmel and...

2448
02:22:58,340 --> 02:23:00,340
See you later.

2449
02:23:07,340 --> 02:23:11,340
Stinky said he could get some wild animals, Papa.

2450
02:23:11,340 --> 02:23:12,340
Where ever fro?

2451
02:23:12,340 --> 02:23:13,340
I don't know.

2452
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:14,340
I wouldn't trust him.

2453
02:23:14,340 --> 02:23:17,340
He'll probably put a head jog in your sleeping bag.

2454
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:18,340
There it is.

2455
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:19,340
The hut.

2456
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:23,340
Oh, oh. Very well built.

2457
02:23:23,340 --> 02:23:24,340
Oh, oh.

2458
02:23:24,340 --> 02:23:25,340
Oh, oh.

2459
02:23:25,340 --> 02:23:26,340
Oh, oh.

2460
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:27,340
Oh, oh.

2461
02:23:27,340 --> 02:23:28,340
Oh, oh.

2462
02:23:28,340 --> 02:23:29,340
Oh, oh.

2463
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:30,340
Oh, oh.

2464
02:23:30,340 --> 02:23:31,340
Oh, oh.

2465
02:23:31,340 --> 02:23:32,340
Oh, oh.

2466
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:33,340
Oh, oh.

2467
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:34,340
Oh, oh.

2468
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:35,340
Oh, oh.

2469
02:23:35,340 --> 02:23:36,340
Oh, oh.

2470
02:23:36,340 --> 02:23:37,340
Oh, oh.

2471
02:23:37,340 --> 02:23:38,340
Oh, oh.

2472
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:39,340
Oh, oh.

2473
02:23:39,340 --> 02:23:40,340
Oh, oh.

2474
02:23:40,340 --> 02:23:41,340
Oh, oh.

2475
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:42,340
Oh, oh.

2476
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:43,340
Oh, oh.

2477
02:23:43,340 --> 02:23:44,340
Oh, oh.

2478
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:45,340
Oh, oh.

2479
02:23:45,340 --> 02:23:46,340
Oh, oh.

2480
02:23:46,340 --> 02:23:47,340
Oh, oh.

2481
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:48,340
Oh, oh.

2482
02:23:48,340 --> 02:23:49,340
Oh, oh.

2483
02:23:49,340 --> 02:23:50,340
Oh, oh.

2484
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:51,340
Oh, oh.

2485
02:23:51,340 --> 02:23:52,340
Oh, oh.

2486
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:54,340
Oh, oh.

2487
02:23:59,340 --> 02:24:00,340
Oh!

2488
02:24:01,340 --> 02:24:02,340
Oh.

2489
02:24:02,340 --> 02:24:04,340
Oh.

2490
02:24:04,340 --> 02:24:06,340
I tell you, it's a wonderful place.

2491
02:24:06,340 --> 02:24:07,340
You love it.

2492
02:24:07,340 --> 02:24:09,340
A real tropical jungle.

2493
02:24:09,340 --> 02:24:11,340
Are you sure it's quite nice here?

2494
02:24:11,340 --> 02:24:13,340
Of course, therein!

2495
02:24:13,340 --> 02:24:14,340
There yaaay!

2496
02:24:14,340 --> 02:24:18,340
Oh, lovely. It is to run free.

2497
02:24:18,340 --> 02:24:24,340
Darling, let's be the first to get to Moomin Valley.

2498
02:24:24,340 --> 02:24:26,340
Oh, my God.

2499
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:28,340
Oh, my God.

2500
02:24:28,340 --> 02:24:30,340
Oh, my God.

2501
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:32,340
Oh, my God.

2502
02:24:32,340 --> 02:24:34,340
Oh, my God.

2503
02:24:34,340 --> 02:24:36,340
Oh, my God.

2504
02:24:36,340 --> 02:24:38,340
Oh, my God.

2505
02:24:38,340 --> 02:24:42,340
Oh, my God.

2506
02:24:42,340 --> 02:24:44,340
Ugh.

2507
02:24:44,340 --> 02:24:46,340
Ugh.

2508
02:24:46,340 --> 02:24:48,340
Ugh.

2509
02:24:48,340 --> 02:24:52,340
Soon I'll have the largest collection in the botanic world.

2510
02:24:52,340 --> 02:24:56,340
And I will be famous and people will come from all over.

2511
02:24:56,340 --> 02:24:58,340
Ugh.

2512
02:24:58,340 --> 02:25:02,340
Now what have we here?

2513
02:25:02,340 --> 02:25:06,340
Ugh.

2514
02:25:06,340 --> 02:25:08,340
Ugh.

2515
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:18,340
Go away, I'm not a zoologist.

2516
02:25:18,340 --> 02:25:20,340
Look, Moomin, those must be the monkey stinky promise.

2517
02:25:20,340 --> 02:25:22,340
Well, that's a surprise.

2518
02:25:22,340 --> 02:25:24,340
Not like him at all.

2519
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:28,340
I just don't trust him.

2520
02:25:28,340 --> 02:25:30,340
What sweet things.

2521
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:34,340
Just like in Tarzan.

2522
02:25:34,340 --> 02:25:36,340
What was that?

2523
02:25:36,340 --> 02:25:38,340
I don't know.

2524
02:25:38,340 --> 02:25:42,340
Ugh.

2525
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:48,340
That sounds like some really wild animal, a lion or a tiger.

2526
02:25:48,340 --> 02:25:54,340
I'm frightened, Moomin.

2527
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:58,340
Huh?

2528
02:25:58,340 --> 02:26:02,340
Ugh.

2529
02:26:02,340 --> 02:26:04,340
Very odd.

2530
02:26:04,340 --> 02:26:06,340
Just like home, isn't it?

2531
02:26:06,340 --> 02:26:08,340
Even if it isn't very big.

2532
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:10,340
Perhaps we could live here.

2533
02:26:10,340 --> 02:26:12,340
Let's go hunting first.

2534
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:14,340
I smell Moomin's.

2535
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:16,340
Oh, be careful darling.

2536
02:26:16,340 --> 02:26:20,340
You're very out of practice.

2537
02:26:20,340 --> 02:26:26,340
I must warn them.

2538
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:28,340
See anything?

2539
02:26:28,340 --> 02:26:30,340
No other thing.

2540
02:26:30,340 --> 02:26:34,340
I must have been imagination.

2541
02:26:34,340 --> 02:26:36,340
Moomin.

2542
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:38,340
Keep quiet.

2543
02:26:38,340 --> 02:26:40,340
Little Moin.

2544
02:26:40,340 --> 02:26:42,340
I've just seen some tigers.

2545
02:26:42,340 --> 02:26:44,340
They're coming to get you.

2546
02:26:44,340 --> 02:26:46,340
Tigers.

2547
02:26:46,340 --> 02:26:48,340
Let's get back to the house quick.

2548
02:26:48,340 --> 02:26:50,340
There's no time.

2549
02:26:50,340 --> 02:26:52,340
They're nearly here.

2550
02:26:52,340 --> 02:26:56,340
We'll go to the bathhouse.

2551
02:27:00,340 --> 02:27:04,340
Shall we eat him up?

2552
02:27:04,340 --> 02:27:08,340
You know that Hamilins upset your tummy, dear rest?

2553
02:27:08,340 --> 02:27:12,340
I wonder where the Moomin's are.

2554
02:27:12,340 --> 02:27:18,340
Huh?

2555
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:24,340
Ugh, just more animals that's all.

2556
02:27:24,340 --> 02:27:30,340
Papa!

2557
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:36,340
Papa! Help!

2558
02:27:36,340 --> 02:27:40,340
What's the matter, Moomin?

2559
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:44,340
Little Moin has seen two tigers and they're looking for us.

2560
02:27:44,340 --> 02:27:46,340
Tigers after us.

2561
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:50,340
That rotten sticky probably told them we're good to eat or something.

2562
02:27:50,340 --> 02:27:52,340
Maybe we are.

2563
02:27:52,340 --> 02:27:53,340
They'll be here in a minute.

2564
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:57,340
Right, Moomin. You go and find the biggest stone you can and bring it back with you.

2565
02:27:57,340 --> 02:28:01,340
Okay.

2566
02:28:09,340 --> 02:28:13,340
This way.

2567
02:28:23,340 --> 02:28:25,340
Papa, will this one do?

2568
02:28:25,340 --> 02:28:29,340
Yes, that's perfect. Right, get into the bathhouse and it's quickly now.

2569
02:28:53,340 --> 02:28:57,340
Here they come.

2570
02:29:01,340 --> 02:29:05,340
Are you really going to eat them, dear rest?

2571
02:29:05,340 --> 02:29:09,340
Of course, my love. You see, I think they're hiding in that little house up there.

2572
02:29:09,340 --> 02:29:13,340
They've been very quiet if they are.

2573
02:29:13,340 --> 02:29:17,340
Huh, they're just too scared to move. That's all.

2574
02:29:17,340 --> 02:29:21,340
Why's that stone there?

2575
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:25,340
My darling!

2576
02:29:25,340 --> 02:29:27,340
It's worth, Papa.

2577
02:29:27,340 --> 02:29:31,340
Well, of course, Moomin.

2578
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:35,340
My husband is drowning.

2579
02:29:35,340 --> 02:29:39,340
Oh, I'm so sorry. Papa, we must help.

2580
02:29:39,340 --> 02:29:43,340
He was just about to try and eat us, Mama.

2581
02:29:43,340 --> 02:29:47,340
I'm sure he won't do it again.

2582
02:29:47,340 --> 02:29:51,340
I suppose so, Moomin.

2583
02:30:11,340 --> 02:30:15,340
Oh, my love.

2584
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:21,340
I thought I'd see the day. Moomin's rescuing a tiger.

2585
02:30:21,340 --> 02:30:25,340
Here you are, dear. Tie this tightly around him and we'll lift him out.

2586
02:30:25,340 --> 02:30:29,340
Thank you, Mama.

2587
02:30:29,340 --> 02:30:33,340
Oh, darling.

2588
02:30:33,340 --> 02:30:37,340
Are you all right, my love?

2589
02:30:37,340 --> 02:30:39,340
What happened? Did we eat them?

2590
02:30:39,340 --> 02:30:43,340
No, you were drowning and they rescued you.

2591
02:30:43,340 --> 02:30:45,340
Oh, now embarrassing.

2592
02:30:45,340 --> 02:30:47,340
Well, they're in that cabin behind you.

2593
02:30:47,340 --> 02:30:49,340
If you still feel like it.

2594
02:30:49,340 --> 02:30:51,340
Oh, darling.

2595
02:30:51,340 --> 02:30:55,340
Are you all right, my love?

2596
02:30:55,340 --> 02:30:57,340
What happened? Did we eat them?

2597
02:30:57,340 --> 02:30:59,340
They're in that cabin behind you.

2598
02:30:59,340 --> 02:31:03,340
If you still feel hungry, but it was rather good of them to save you.

2599
02:31:03,340 --> 02:31:05,340
No, my appetite's completely gone.

2600
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:07,340
We'll come back here then and we'll go.

2601
02:31:07,340 --> 02:31:09,340
I'll just jump over.

2602
02:31:15,340 --> 02:31:17,340
Oh!

2603
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:19,340
What's the matter?

2604
02:31:19,340 --> 02:31:21,340
I can't remember how to jump.

2605
02:31:21,340 --> 02:31:23,340
We've been stuck in that zoo for too long.

2606
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:25,340
Let's try and swim across, dear.

2607
02:31:27,340 --> 02:31:29,340
Okay.

2608
02:31:31,340 --> 02:31:33,340
Hmm?

2609
02:31:39,340 --> 02:31:42,340
We come, everyone. The tigers are leaving.

2610
02:31:42,340 --> 02:31:45,340
I'm glad you didn't grow.

2611
02:31:49,340 --> 02:31:52,340
I knew they wouldn't be mean enough to eat us after saving him.

2612
02:31:52,340 --> 02:31:56,340
Shall we jump in and swim back as well? It's not far.

2613
02:31:56,340 --> 02:31:58,340
Yes. I'll go first.

2614
02:31:58,340 --> 02:32:00,340
I want to go first.

2615
02:32:00,340 --> 02:32:02,340
Darling, am I?

2616
02:32:02,340 --> 02:32:04,340
Be careful, movement.

2617
02:32:04,340 --> 02:32:06,340
Look over there.

2618
02:32:10,340 --> 02:32:12,340
Crocodiles.

2619
02:32:12,340 --> 02:32:16,340
Hurry up, movement. Swim around the back and come up the ladder.

2620
02:32:22,340 --> 02:32:24,340
Huh?

2621
02:32:26,340 --> 02:32:28,340
How can there be crocodiles in the sea?

2622
02:32:28,340 --> 02:32:31,340
I thought they only lived in fresh water.

2623
02:32:31,340 --> 02:32:34,340
How are we going to get back to the shore now?

2624
02:32:34,340 --> 02:32:36,340
We'll have to wait for a boat to come past.

2625
02:32:36,340 --> 02:32:40,340
No, I'm afraid we'll have to think of something else, Mama.

2626
02:32:40,340 --> 02:32:43,340
We could be waiting for a wink or something for that to happen.

2627
02:32:43,340 --> 02:32:45,340
A whole week!

2628
02:32:45,340 --> 02:32:49,340
But we'll starve. All they'll find is our bones bleached, waiting the sun.

2629
02:32:49,340 --> 02:32:53,340
Don't worry, little mind. Papa will think of something you'll see.

2630
02:32:53,340 --> 02:32:55,340
Good morning.

2631
02:32:57,340 --> 02:32:59,340
Snuffkin, what are you leaving?

2632
02:32:59,340 --> 02:33:01,340
I was going to go sea fishing.

2633
02:33:01,340 --> 02:33:03,340
But I changed my mind.

2634
02:33:03,340 --> 02:33:07,340
I didn't fancy landing a sea monster.

2635
02:33:12,340 --> 02:33:17,340
Help! Someone help! Help anybody!

2636
02:33:17,340 --> 02:33:19,340
That's Mr. Himmelin.

2637
02:33:19,340 --> 02:33:23,340
Oh, the tigers must be after him quickly.

2638
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:35,340
I never made you so cross. I just told you not to eat my plants.

2639
02:33:35,340 --> 02:33:41,340
And please, someone anyone help!

2640
02:33:41,340 --> 02:33:43,340
Help!

2641
02:33:44,340 --> 02:33:46,340
Let me in!

2642
02:33:55,340 --> 02:33:57,340
That fella's always been clumsy.

2643
02:33:57,340 --> 02:33:59,340
We can't really help him.

2644
02:33:59,340 --> 02:34:00,340
No.

2645
02:34:06,340 --> 02:34:07,340
Are you alright, Himmelin?

2646
02:34:07,340 --> 02:34:09,340
Oh, dear, I think so.

2647
02:34:09,340 --> 02:34:11,340
What about him?

2648
02:34:11,340 --> 02:34:14,340
What do you do when a rhino gets stuck in your brando?

2649
02:34:14,340 --> 02:34:16,340
Oh, this is a new one, aren't we?

2650
02:34:16,340 --> 02:34:18,340
So I'm loose. I can't think of any other way.

2651
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:20,340
You have to be very careful, though.

2652
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:22,340
I think you're right.

2653
02:34:32,340 --> 02:34:33,340
Ah, look where you're going!

2654
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:36,340
It was you who brought all the animals in, wasn't it?

2655
02:34:36,340 --> 02:34:38,340
Yes, you're right. That's what you wanted.

2656
02:34:38,340 --> 02:34:41,340
It's a jungle now. I did a good job.

2657
02:34:41,340 --> 02:34:44,340
Oh, really? Well, they're not wild animals at all.

2658
02:34:44,340 --> 02:34:45,340
They're quite friendly.

2659
02:34:45,340 --> 02:34:47,340
Friendly?

2660
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:11,340
See what I mean? They make very good pets.

2661
02:35:11,340 --> 02:35:13,340
Cute, aren't they?

2662
02:35:20,340 --> 02:35:23,340
Snake! Go stick where are you?

2663
02:35:25,340 --> 02:35:27,340
What do you want?

2664
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:30,340
The rhino and the tigers have become pets of the movement family.

2665
02:35:30,340 --> 02:35:32,340
You're not going to let that happen to you.

2666
02:35:32,340 --> 02:35:33,340
Well, are you?

2667
02:35:33,340 --> 02:35:34,340
It's not.

2668
02:35:34,340 --> 02:35:37,340
I'll bring snorked maiden and movement here tonight.

2669
02:35:37,340 --> 02:35:41,340
There's no need to eat all of them. Just bite off their tails, all right?

2670
02:35:41,340 --> 02:35:43,340
Okay.

2671
02:35:45,340 --> 02:35:48,340
You'll be really amazed, like I was.

2672
02:35:48,340 --> 02:35:51,340
It's big enough for both of you to sit on.

2673
02:35:51,340 --> 02:35:53,340
How lovely, a giant water lily.

2674
02:35:53,340 --> 02:35:57,340
I wonder if the seeds came from that box you all found.

2675
02:35:57,340 --> 02:35:59,340
Oh, I can't wait to see it.

2676
02:35:59,340 --> 02:36:01,340
Looking at the size of the jungle,

2677
02:36:01,340 --> 02:36:04,340
there must have been an awful lot of seeds in that box.

2678
02:36:04,340 --> 02:36:07,340
I suppose the wind could have blown them anywhere.

2679
02:36:09,340 --> 02:36:11,340
Where's the giant water lily?

2680
02:36:11,340 --> 02:36:13,340
Let's see now.

2681
02:36:14,340 --> 02:36:16,340
Over there.

2682
02:36:21,340 --> 02:36:23,340
How wonderful.

2683
02:36:23,340 --> 02:36:26,340
You see, I wish you'd learn to trust me.

2684
02:36:26,340 --> 02:36:28,340
I'm a very honest guy.

2685
02:36:30,340 --> 02:36:33,340
It's so soft and pink and beautiful.

2686
02:36:34,340 --> 02:36:36,340
Yeah.

2687
02:36:39,340 --> 02:36:42,340
How romantic to be on a boat made from a flower.

2688
02:36:42,340 --> 02:36:44,340
This is unbelievable.

2689
02:36:44,340 --> 02:36:47,340
Our old box seems to have grown into a tropical swamp.

2690
02:36:47,340 --> 02:36:48,340
It's a lot nicer.

2691
02:36:48,340 --> 02:36:50,340
Hey, stinky.

2692
02:36:50,340 --> 02:36:52,340
Stinky?

2693
02:36:52,340 --> 02:36:53,340
Oh.

2694
02:36:53,340 --> 02:36:56,340
I can't see him anywhere.

2695
02:36:58,340 --> 02:37:00,340
I wonder how far will float.

2696
02:37:00,340 --> 02:37:03,340
It's getting dark, Moomin.

2697
02:37:03,340 --> 02:37:05,340
Whoa!

2698
02:37:07,340 --> 02:37:09,340
Whoa!

2699
02:37:13,340 --> 02:37:15,340
Gotcha!

2700
02:37:15,340 --> 02:37:17,340
We must get away!

2701
02:37:17,340 --> 02:37:19,340
I don't know yet.

2702
02:37:19,340 --> 02:37:21,340
Look, there's the seed.

2703
02:37:21,340 --> 02:37:23,340
Put the crooked aisles.

2704
02:37:23,340 --> 02:37:26,340
Over there, start making a boat.

2705
02:37:26,340 --> 02:37:30,340
Well, it's the only way we'll get away from least monster.

2706
02:37:30,340 --> 02:37:32,340
Whoa!

2707
02:37:48,340 --> 02:37:50,340
Keep going, Snorkmaid.

2708
02:37:50,340 --> 02:37:52,340
We're almost there.

2709
02:37:54,340 --> 02:37:56,340
Wait.

2710
02:37:56,340 --> 02:38:00,340
Moomin and Snorkmaid kept swimming as fast as they could.

2711
02:38:00,340 --> 02:38:03,340
They had a head start on the snake, but now he was catching up.

2712
02:38:03,340 --> 02:38:06,340
Even though Moomin's are very good swimmers,

2713
02:38:06,340 --> 02:38:10,340
unfortunately for them, so are snakes.

2714
02:38:12,340 --> 02:38:19,340
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

2715
02:38:19,340 --> 02:38:26,340
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2716
02:38:26,340 --> 02:38:30,340
They're always happy and always at play.

2717
02:38:30,340 --> 02:38:34,340
The movements are having fun day after day.

2718
02:38:34,340 --> 02:38:37,340
The movements.

2719
02:38:37,340 --> 02:38:41,340
The movements.

2720
02:38:41,340 --> 02:38:48,340
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

2721
02:38:49,340 --> 02:38:56,340
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2722
02:38:56,340 --> 02:39:00,340
They're always happy and always at play.

2723
02:39:00,340 --> 02:39:04,340
The movements are having fun day after day.

2724
02:39:04,340 --> 02:39:07,340
The movements.

2725
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:11,340
The movements.

2726
02:39:11,340 --> 02:39:17,340
The movements.

2727
02:39:19,340 --> 02:39:23,340
Here they are for one and all.

2728
02:39:23,340 --> 02:39:26,340
The movements are about to come.

2729
02:39:26,340 --> 02:39:29,340
Come on and sit down here with me.

2730
02:39:29,340 --> 02:39:32,340
They have for you on your TV.

2731
02:39:32,340 --> 02:39:36,340
They are the movements.

2732
02:39:36,340 --> 02:39:39,340
Here they are for one and all.

2733
02:39:39,340 --> 02:39:42,340
The movements are about to come.

2734
02:39:42,340 --> 02:39:45,340
Come on and sit down here with me.

2735
02:39:45,340 --> 02:39:47,340
Here for you on your TV.

2736
02:39:47,340 --> 02:39:50,340
They are the movements.

2737
02:39:50,340 --> 02:39:53,340
They are the movements.

2738
02:39:53,340 --> 02:39:56,340
So come with me, give me your hand.

2739
02:39:56,340 --> 02:39:59,340
I'll take you up to a moment land.

2740
02:39:59,340 --> 02:40:02,340
You can fly just like a bird.

2741
02:40:02,340 --> 02:40:04,340
Sing that song ever.

2742
02:40:04,340 --> 02:40:07,340
There were the movements.

2743
02:40:07,340 --> 02:40:10,340
There were the movements.

2744
02:40:10,340 --> 02:40:13,340
There were the movements.

2745
02:40:13,340 --> 02:40:18,340
There were the movements.

2746
02:40:18,340 --> 02:40:22,340
There were the movements.

2747
02:40:43,340 --> 02:40:50,340
The movements.

2748
02:40:50,340 --> 02:40:57,340
The movements.

2749
02:40:57,340 --> 02:41:06,340
The movements.

2750
02:41:06,340 --> 02:41:08,340
The movements.

2751
02:41:08,340 --> 02:41:10,340
Where are you moving?

2752
02:41:10,340 --> 02:41:12,340
It's not made in.

2753
02:41:12,340 --> 02:41:16,900
The rhino and the tigers that stinky set free from the zoo are now living in the jungle

2754
02:41:16,900 --> 02:41:21,940
that has grown up around Moomin house, and have settled into the restful life of Moomin Valley.

2755
02:41:24,740 --> 02:41:26,340
Hey, have you seen Moomin?

2756
02:41:26,340 --> 02:41:28,340
No, you haven't seen him all evening.

2757
02:41:30,340 --> 02:41:32,340
I wonder where they got to.

2758
02:41:34,340 --> 02:41:39,020
Meanwhile, Moomin and Snorkmaiden chased by the snake, are swimming as fast as they can

2759
02:41:39,020 --> 02:41:40,020
out to sea.

2760
02:41:42,340 --> 02:41:43,540
I can't swim another.

2761
02:41:43,540 --> 02:41:45,540
Snorkmaiden, you must!

2762
02:41:47,940 --> 02:41:50,740
Hey! Hey, you there!

2763
02:41:54,740 --> 02:41:56,740
Come on, Snorkmaiden, nearly there!

2764
02:41:57,740 --> 02:42:01,940
Look, there's a couple of hippos that come and towards us. We better get them on board.

2765
02:42:01,940 --> 02:42:05,940
That's funny. I haven't heard about any hippos reported missing from the zoo lately.

2766
02:42:07,140 --> 02:42:09,140
Just a bit further, Snorkmaiden.

2767
02:42:12,740 --> 02:42:16,740
We made it.

2768
02:42:16,740 --> 02:42:20,740
I didn't know hippos could climb so well.

2769
02:42:20,740 --> 02:42:26,740
Oh, thank you so much. There was a huge snake chasing us.

2770
02:42:26,740 --> 02:42:29,940
Yes, we saw you were lucky we came along when we did.

2771
02:42:29,940 --> 02:42:32,340
Thank you for your help. Who's ship is this?

2772
02:42:32,340 --> 02:42:34,340
Ours, we're from the zoo.

2773
02:42:34,340 --> 02:42:38,340
The zoo? Oh, you've got one of the crocodiles.

2774
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:40,340
Yes, and a lot of trouble he gave us as well.

2775
02:42:41,140 --> 02:42:44,340
There's another one around here somewhere. We saw them.

2776
02:42:44,340 --> 02:42:47,140
Yes, we know there is, but we haven't been able to find him yet.

2777
02:42:47,140 --> 02:42:51,140
Oh, boy, I wish they'd come as quietly as you hippos did.

2778
02:42:51,140 --> 02:42:53,140
Hippos? Hippos?

2779
02:42:53,140 --> 02:42:57,140
Which zoo are you from? I bet they'd pay well to get you back.

2780
02:42:57,140 --> 02:43:00,340
Now, look here. I'm a Mormon, not a hippo.

2781
02:43:00,340 --> 02:43:02,340
Are you saying that I look like a hippo?

2782
02:43:02,340 --> 02:43:05,140
Well, perhaps they don't look exactly like hippos.

2783
02:43:05,140 --> 02:43:07,140
No, but they're close enough, Cam.

2784
02:43:07,940 --> 02:43:10,740
I'm sure they've escaped from the zoo somewhere, though.

2785
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:11,540
Yes, sir.

2786
02:43:11,540 --> 02:43:14,740
We haven't escaped from anywhere, certainly not a zoo.

2787
02:43:14,740 --> 02:43:17,140
We live in Moomin Valley. We're Moomin's.

2788
02:43:17,140 --> 02:43:19,940
It's all right, Snork Maiden. I'll not be taken for a hippo.

2789
02:43:19,940 --> 02:43:21,540
Come on, let's run for it.

2790
02:43:21,540 --> 02:43:25,140
Hey, wait. There's a nice cozy cage already for you.

2791
02:43:25,140 --> 02:43:26,340
Hurry, Snork Maiden.

2792
02:43:26,340 --> 02:43:28,340
Ask to them.

2793
02:43:28,340 --> 02:43:30,340
Stop them now. Don't let them get away.

2794
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:33,540
Where are we going, Moomin?

2795
02:43:33,540 --> 02:43:35,540
Now to the sea.

2796
02:43:37,940 --> 02:43:40,340
Quickly, man, lower the live boat.

2797
02:43:40,340 --> 02:43:42,340
They're not going to put us in any zoo.

2798
02:43:47,540 --> 02:43:50,740
Why did you come back? I thought you were on the boat.

2799
02:43:50,740 --> 02:43:51,540
Oh, no.

2800
02:43:51,540 --> 02:43:54,340
Don't worry. I never eat anything when I'm not swimming.

2801
02:43:54,340 --> 02:43:56,340
Are you sure?

2802
02:43:56,340 --> 02:43:58,340
I'm sure. Now where's this ship?

2803
02:43:59,540 --> 02:44:01,540
Oh, they're catching up with us.

2804
02:44:01,540 --> 02:44:04,340
They want to put us in a cage and take us to the zoo.

2805
02:44:04,340 --> 02:44:07,540
Me too, I expect. They're always trying to get me.

2806
02:44:07,540 --> 02:44:08,740
They've got one of the crocodiles.

2807
02:44:08,740 --> 02:44:10,900
Oh, did they? They were my friends.

2808
02:44:10,900 --> 02:44:13,060
Right. Hang on to me, you two.

2809
02:44:13,060 --> 02:44:15,540
I'm certainly not going back to any zoo.

2810
02:44:15,540 --> 02:44:17,540
Never, let's go.

2811
02:44:18,740 --> 02:44:19,540
Oh, no.

2812
02:44:19,540 --> 02:44:21,540
Hold on tight.

2813
02:44:23,540 --> 02:44:26,740
Come back, you horrible reptile. Come back.

2814
02:44:30,340 --> 02:44:32,340
Moomin's been caught by a big snake.

2815
02:44:32,340 --> 02:44:35,060
Yes, mama snorked maiden as well.

2816
02:44:35,060 --> 02:44:37,540
Dear stinky, that's not true, is it?

2817
02:44:37,540 --> 02:44:40,500
I wish people would realize that I almost never lie.

2818
02:44:40,500 --> 02:44:43,140
I'm sorry about them, but I thought I'd better tell you.

2819
02:44:43,140 --> 02:44:46,180
There aren't any snakes that big in Moomin Valley.

2820
02:44:46,180 --> 02:44:47,700
There are tigers here, aren't there?

2821
02:44:47,700 --> 02:44:49,140
Well, there's big snakes too.

2822
02:44:50,020 --> 02:44:52,100
You brought the snake here, didn't you?

2823
02:44:52,100 --> 02:44:54,980
Papa, I'm not saying that I believe him,

2824
02:44:54,980 --> 02:44:58,820
but I think we'd better look for them just to be on the safe side, don't you?

2825
02:44:58,820 --> 02:45:02,180
Okay, don't believe me. I told you so my conscience is clear.

2826
02:45:02,180 --> 02:45:04,740
Where exactly did the snake attack them, stinky?

2827
02:45:04,740 --> 02:45:06,740
Down in the swamp by the sea.

2828
02:45:06,740 --> 02:45:07,940
Let's go, mama.

2829
02:45:08,820 --> 02:45:10,100
I'll come with you.

2830
02:45:10,100 --> 02:45:11,780
No, you'd better stay little, my,

2831
02:45:11,780 --> 02:45:14,340
until Moomin, where we've gone, if he comes back,

2832
02:45:14,340 --> 02:45:16,980
he'll only worry if there's no one here.

2833
02:45:16,980 --> 02:45:19,700
And stinky, you'll show us where to go.

2834
02:45:19,700 --> 02:45:20,340
Okay.

2835
02:45:20,420 --> 02:45:22,020
Okay.

2836
02:45:28,020 --> 02:45:31,460
Oh, no.

2837
02:45:31,460 --> 02:45:32,580
Oh, no.

2838
02:45:32,580 --> 02:45:32,980
Oh, oh, no.

2839
02:45:32,980 --> 02:45:34,500
Hey, you!

2840
02:45:34,500 --> 02:45:36,660
Have you eaten Moomin and Snorkmaden?

2841
02:45:36,660 --> 02:45:38,980
It's alright, mama. We're here.

2842
02:45:38,980 --> 02:45:40,980
Oh, praise the boob, the boob, the boob.

2843
02:45:40,980 --> 02:45:42,220
Say...

2844
02:45:42,220 --> 02:45:43,220
Me time, you friend.

2845
02:45:43,220 --> 02:45:44,900
What a very big friend.

2846
02:45:44,900 --> 02:45:47,860
Please come in as much of you as you like.

2847
02:45:47,860 --> 02:45:49,940
Stinky just told us that you and Snorkmaden

2848
02:45:49,940 --> 02:45:52,480
They didn't been caught by a big snake, so we...

2849
02:45:52,480 --> 02:45:54,480
Where are you going, Stinky?

2850
02:45:55,480 --> 02:45:57,080
She did chase us at first.

2851
02:45:57,080 --> 02:45:58,580
Then we managed to get on a boat,

2852
02:45:58,580 --> 02:46:00,180
but they wanted to put us in a cage,

2853
02:46:00,180 --> 02:46:02,780
so we jumped back in the sea, met the snake again,

2854
02:46:02,780 --> 02:46:04,020
then they tried to catch her too,

2855
02:46:04,020 --> 02:46:06,680
so she helped us to get away, and now she's our friend.

2856
02:46:06,680 --> 02:46:08,180
Who are they?

2857
02:46:08,180 --> 02:46:09,620
Men from the zoo.

2858
02:46:09,620 --> 02:46:11,620
They've come to recapture all the animals

2859
02:46:11,620 --> 02:46:13,060
and take them away from the jungle

2860
02:46:13,060 --> 02:46:14,820
and put them in cages again.

2861
02:46:14,820 --> 02:46:15,820
Mm, nice.

2862
02:46:15,820 --> 02:46:18,260
Second, you don't want to go back in the zoo.

2863
02:46:18,260 --> 02:46:20,340
Papa, we've got to protect our friends.

2864
02:46:20,340 --> 02:46:21,860
Yes, we have.

2865
02:46:21,860 --> 02:46:24,300
I'm sure that the tigers and that nice rhino

2866
02:46:24,300 --> 02:46:25,500
don't want to go back even.

2867
02:46:25,500 --> 02:46:27,540
Oh, of course they don't.

2868
02:46:27,540 --> 02:46:30,340
They want to be free and live again, our jungle.

2869
02:46:30,340 --> 02:46:31,900
Why don't you go and explore it?

2870
02:46:31,900 --> 02:46:33,820
I'm sure it'll be just like home.

2871
02:46:33,820 --> 02:46:35,140
And if you see the zoo people,

2872
02:46:35,140 --> 02:46:36,900
you can come back here, can't you?

2873
02:46:37,900 --> 02:46:40,340
I'm sure you'll like it here, Mrs. Snake.

2874
02:46:40,340 --> 02:46:42,460
Yes, I'm sure I will.

2875
02:46:42,460 --> 02:46:44,460
Come on, I'll show you the jungle.

2876
02:46:44,460 --> 02:46:45,460
Eh!

2877
02:46:46,460 --> 02:46:50,460
I'm so relieved that you're both all right at home.

2878
02:46:50,460 --> 02:46:54,460
So are we, Mama, but there's something we haven't told you.

2879
02:46:54,460 --> 02:46:57,460
Yes, they thought we were hippopotamuses.

2880
02:46:57,460 --> 02:46:58,460
What?

2881
02:46:58,460 --> 02:46:59,460
Who did?

2882
02:46:59,460 --> 02:47:01,460
They need their eyes, Destiny.

2883
02:47:01,460 --> 02:47:03,460
The men from the zoo.

2884
02:47:03,460 --> 02:47:05,460
They thought we had escaped from another zoo

2885
02:47:05,460 --> 02:47:08,460
and were trying to catch us and they nearly succeeded.

2886
02:47:08,460 --> 02:47:09,460
Now, rude.

2887
02:47:09,460 --> 02:47:12,460
We're not at all like hippos, the cheek of it.

2888
02:47:13,460 --> 02:47:16,460
So these men were only trying to capture our new friends,

2889
02:47:16,460 --> 02:47:18,460
but you and Snork Maiden as well.

2890
02:47:18,460 --> 02:47:20,460
And me and Papa, if they'd known about us.

2891
02:47:20,460 --> 02:47:21,460
That's right, Mama.

2892
02:47:21,460 --> 02:47:22,460
They're idiots.

2893
02:47:22,460 --> 02:47:25,460
Hippopotamuses don't wear aprons or right memoirs.

2894
02:47:25,460 --> 02:47:27,460
That's really made me angry.

2895
02:47:27,460 --> 02:47:30,460
I bet they never faced the wrath of a movement Papa before.

2896
02:47:30,460 --> 02:47:35,460
I want to see you wrap yourself round and choke somebody.

2897
02:47:35,460 --> 02:47:36,460
I know.

2898
02:47:36,460 --> 02:47:37,460
How about the tiger?

2899
02:47:37,460 --> 02:47:38,460
He do.

2900
02:47:38,460 --> 02:47:40,460
I'd rather not.

2901
02:47:40,460 --> 02:47:43,460
We became friends in the zoo.

2902
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:44,460
Oh, I know.

2903
02:47:44,460 --> 02:47:45,460
Choke stinky.

2904
02:47:45,460 --> 02:47:46,460
That'll be much better.

2905
02:47:46,460 --> 02:47:52,460
Yes, my dewey did let us out of the zoo.

2906
02:47:52,460 --> 02:47:54,460
Well, you're a great disappointment to me.

2907
02:47:54,460 --> 02:47:57,460
I let you out because I thought you'd attack the movements,

2908
02:47:57,460 --> 02:47:58,460
but you have tea with them instead.

2909
02:47:58,460 --> 02:47:59,460
You're pathetic.

2910
02:47:59,460 --> 02:48:00,460
You know that?

2911
02:48:00,460 --> 02:48:03,460
I'm sorry, but we were brought up in captivity

2912
02:48:03,460 --> 02:48:05,460
and we never had to hunt for our food.

2913
02:48:05,460 --> 02:48:07,460
All our meals are brought to us, you see.

2914
02:48:07,460 --> 02:48:10,460
But your tigers what do you eat them?

2915
02:48:10,460 --> 02:48:13,460
Well, we love cat food.

2916
02:48:13,460 --> 02:48:14,460
Cat food.

2917
02:48:14,460 --> 02:48:17,460
Oh, I don't believe it.

2918
02:48:17,460 --> 02:48:21,460
Yes, it's easy to chew and it leaves our fur all sleek and shiny.

2919
02:48:21,460 --> 02:48:24,460
We like the yellow tins with the black cat, don't we, honey?

2920
02:48:24,460 --> 02:48:25,460
Yes, it's our favorite.

2921
02:48:25,460 --> 02:48:28,460
You wouldn't happen to have any on you, would you?

2922
02:48:38,460 --> 02:48:39,460
Mama!

2923
02:48:39,460 --> 02:48:41,460
Papa, quickly!

2924
02:48:42,460 --> 02:48:43,460
They're here.

2925
02:48:43,460 --> 02:48:45,460
The zoo men are here.

2926
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:49,460
Oh, get all the animals into the house first, you.

2927
02:48:49,460 --> 02:48:51,460
Hurry, moment.

2928
02:48:51,460 --> 02:48:52,460
Okay, Papa.

2929
02:48:55,460 --> 02:48:57,460
The zoo men have come to get you.

2930
02:48:57,460 --> 02:48:58,460
They're here.

2931
02:48:58,460 --> 02:48:59,460
The zoo men are here.

2932
02:48:59,460 --> 02:49:02,460
Oh, get all the animals into the house first.

2933
02:49:02,460 --> 02:49:03,460
Hurry, moment.

2934
02:49:03,460 --> 02:49:04,460
Okay, Papa.

2935
02:49:05,460 --> 02:49:07,460
The zoo men have come to get you.

2936
02:49:07,460 --> 02:49:10,460
Hurry, you'll be safe in the moment house.

2937
02:49:10,460 --> 02:49:12,460
Quick as you can, Rhino.

2938
02:49:12,460 --> 02:49:13,460
Into the house.

2939
02:49:13,460 --> 02:49:14,460
Go on.

2940
02:49:19,460 --> 02:49:21,460
Now, Rhino, push him.

2941
02:49:21,460 --> 02:49:22,460
I'm sorry.

2942
02:49:35,460 --> 02:49:40,460
Um, I don't think that's a good place to hide, Mrs. Snake.

2943
02:49:43,460 --> 02:49:46,460
I'm afraid that doesn't look quite right, Tiger.

2944
02:49:46,460 --> 02:49:49,460
I thought I might just look like a thick rug.

2945
02:49:49,460 --> 02:49:52,460
I'll just lie here like a beautiful porcelain ornament.

2946
02:49:52,460 --> 02:49:55,460
They'll never know we're here, darling.

2947
02:49:55,460 --> 02:49:59,460
Well, they'd never expect to find a Rhino under there.

2948
02:49:59,460 --> 02:50:00,460
That's what I thought.

2949
02:50:00,460 --> 02:50:01,460
Where are they?

2950
02:50:01,460 --> 02:50:04,460
They can't just have vanished into thin air.

2951
02:50:07,460 --> 02:50:08,460
Hmm.

2952
02:50:08,460 --> 02:50:09,460
Look.

2953
02:50:09,460 --> 02:50:10,460
Up there.

2954
02:50:11,460 --> 02:50:12,460
In the chimney.

2955
02:50:17,460 --> 02:50:19,460
So they're in there, are they?

2956
02:50:32,460 --> 02:50:33,460
Papa!

2957
02:50:35,460 --> 02:50:38,460
They've seen the snake. They're nearly here.

2958
02:50:41,460 --> 02:50:44,460
Now, I want you to calm down and be quiet, everyone.

2959
02:50:44,460 --> 02:50:45,460
We won't let them take you away.

2960
02:50:45,460 --> 02:50:49,460
I promise you they'll have a fight on the hands if they try.

2961
02:50:49,460 --> 02:50:50,460
Teeth, please, my love.

2962
02:50:50,460 --> 02:50:51,460
Of course, dear.

2963
02:51:02,460 --> 02:51:03,460
Hello.

2964
02:51:06,460 --> 02:51:07,460
Hello.

2965
02:51:08,460 --> 02:51:09,460
Hello.

2966
02:51:10,460 --> 02:51:11,460
Hello.

2967
02:51:17,460 --> 02:51:19,460
Hello, having a picnic, are you?

2968
02:51:19,460 --> 02:51:20,460
It's lovely day for you.

2969
02:51:20,460 --> 02:51:21,460
Not at all.

2970
02:51:21,460 --> 02:51:23,460
We're all here from the zoo, sir.

2971
02:51:23,460 --> 02:51:25,460
Oh, are you on some sort of expedition?

2972
02:51:25,460 --> 02:51:28,460
Excuse me, but are you the owner of this house?

2973
02:51:28,460 --> 02:51:31,460
Yes, indeed, I am. I'm moving Papa.

2974
02:51:31,460 --> 02:51:33,460
Well, what can I do for you?

2975
02:51:33,460 --> 02:51:35,460
Well, you could send out the animals hiding in your house.

2976
02:51:35,460 --> 02:51:37,460
That'll do for a start.

2977
02:51:37,460 --> 02:51:38,460
Animals?

2978
02:51:38,460 --> 02:51:39,460
Oh, no.

2979
02:51:39,460 --> 02:51:42,460
We have firm believers that they belong outside.

2980
02:51:42,460 --> 02:51:46,460
Sir, you can't see from where you are, but I can assure you that there is a python

2981
02:51:46,460 --> 02:51:48,460
sticking its head out of your chimney.

2982
02:51:48,460 --> 02:51:49,460
A python?

2983
02:51:49,460 --> 02:51:51,460
Yes, that's right.

2984
02:51:51,460 --> 02:51:53,460
No, it isn't.

2985
02:51:53,460 --> 02:51:54,460
It isn't.

2986
02:51:54,460 --> 02:51:56,460
No, it's my daughter.

2987
02:51:56,460 --> 02:51:58,460
She happens to look like a python.

2988
02:51:58,460 --> 02:52:01,460
Not all the time you understand.

2989
02:52:01,460 --> 02:52:03,460
Right, come on, man.

2990
02:52:03,460 --> 02:52:05,460
We'll go and get the zoo's property.

2991
02:52:05,460 --> 02:52:07,460
No, you will not enter my house.

2992
02:52:07,460 --> 02:52:09,460
All right, well, you let the animals out.

2993
02:52:09,460 --> 02:52:10,460
We won't have to.

2994
02:52:10,460 --> 02:52:11,460
It's up to you, sir.

2995
02:52:11,460 --> 02:52:14,460
There are no animals, and you won't enter my house.

2996
02:52:14,460 --> 02:52:15,460
Now, wait a minute.

2997
02:52:15,460 --> 02:52:16,460
I do believe, yes.

2998
02:52:16,460 --> 02:52:19,460
You're one of those hippos, aren't you?

2999
02:52:19,460 --> 02:52:20,460
I am not.

3000
02:52:20,460 --> 02:52:23,460
I'm moving Papa, and I am the owner of this house.

3001
02:52:23,460 --> 02:52:24,460
No, you're not.

3002
02:52:24,460 --> 02:52:25,460
You're a hippopotamus.

3003
02:52:25,460 --> 02:52:26,460
How did?

3004
02:52:26,460 --> 02:52:30,460
A hippo who owns a house, and it's also running in an illegal zoo.

3005
02:52:30,460 --> 02:52:32,460
Break down the doors.

3006
02:52:32,460 --> 02:52:34,460
That is against the law.

3007
02:52:34,460 --> 02:52:35,460
Oh, it is, isn't?

3008
02:52:35,460 --> 02:52:39,460
Well, there's a nice cage winning for you as well, woman Papa, hippo.

3009
02:52:39,460 --> 02:52:43,460
I warn you, if you touch that door, you'll regret it.

3010
02:52:43,460 --> 02:52:44,460
Go, yeah?

3011
02:52:46,460 --> 02:52:47,460
Great boys.

3012
02:52:47,460 --> 02:52:48,460
Let's go in.

3013
02:52:48,460 --> 02:52:49,460
Charge!

3014
02:52:54,460 --> 02:52:55,460
Ah!

3015
02:52:55,460 --> 02:52:56,460
Ah!

3016
02:52:56,460 --> 02:52:57,460
Ah!

3017
02:52:57,460 --> 02:52:58,460
Ah!

3018
02:52:58,460 --> 02:52:59,460
Ah!

3019
02:52:59,460 --> 02:53:00,460
Ah!

3020
02:53:00,460 --> 02:53:01,460
Ah!

3021
02:53:01,460 --> 02:53:02,460
Ah!

3022
02:53:02,460 --> 02:53:03,460
Ah!

3023
02:53:03,460 --> 02:53:04,460
Ah!

3024
02:53:04,460 --> 02:53:05,460
Ah!

3025
02:53:05,460 --> 02:53:06,460
Ah!

3026
02:53:06,460 --> 02:53:07,460
Ah!

3027
02:53:07,460 --> 02:53:08,460
Ah!

3028
02:53:08,460 --> 02:53:10,460
Ah!

3029
02:53:10,460 --> 02:53:11,460
Ah!

3030
02:53:11,460 --> 02:53:12,460
Ah!

3031
02:53:12,460 --> 02:53:14,460
Now then, what's going on?

3032
02:53:14,460 --> 02:53:16,460
Little Mike brought the inspector.

3033
02:53:16,460 --> 02:53:19,460
All right, what do you men think you're doing?

3034
02:53:19,460 --> 02:53:22,460
Ah, there are high animals from the zoo in this house.

3035
02:53:22,460 --> 02:53:23,460
We want them back.

3036
02:53:23,460 --> 02:53:26,460
I tried to reason with the hippo, but it was no good.

3037
02:53:26,460 --> 02:53:30,460
Oh, have you know that's willful destruction of property, my good man?

3038
02:53:30,460 --> 02:53:31,460
It's not.

3039
02:53:31,460 --> 02:53:32,460
Well, for we're from the zoo.

3040
02:53:32,460 --> 02:53:33,460
We got to get in somehow.

3041
02:53:33,460 --> 02:53:38,460
Oh, have you, and can you be sure that there are zoo animals in there?

3042
02:53:38,460 --> 02:53:40,460
You just take a look up there at the chimney.

3043
02:53:40,460 --> 02:53:42,460
That's all I'm sure.

3044
02:53:42,460 --> 02:53:44,460
Go on.

3045
02:53:44,460 --> 02:53:47,460
See that python's head sticking out?

3046
02:53:47,460 --> 02:53:49,460
That's all.

3047
02:53:49,460 --> 02:53:51,460
I can't see a python's head.

3048
02:53:51,460 --> 02:53:53,460
There was a python's head up there.

3049
02:53:53,460 --> 02:53:54,460
I saw it.

3050
02:53:54,460 --> 02:53:57,460
Ugh, I can't breathe.

3051
02:53:57,460 --> 02:54:00,460
Now you listen to me, zoo man.

3052
02:54:00,460 --> 02:54:01,460
Huh?

3053
02:54:01,460 --> 02:54:04,460
Either you stop bothering my friends or I'll arrest you.

3054
02:54:04,460 --> 02:54:05,460
Is that clear?

3055
02:54:05,460 --> 02:54:06,460
Well, is it?

3056
02:54:06,460 --> 02:54:07,460
Yes, sir, it is.

3057
02:54:07,460 --> 02:54:09,460
But what about the zoo animals?

3058
02:54:09,460 --> 02:54:11,460
You heard the inspector.

3059
02:54:11,460 --> 02:54:12,460
Now go away.

3060
02:54:12,460 --> 02:54:13,460
Do you see that?

3061
02:54:13,460 --> 02:54:14,460
See what?

3062
02:54:14,460 --> 02:54:15,460
The hippopotamus.

3063
02:54:15,460 --> 02:54:16,460
What?

3064
02:54:16,460 --> 02:54:17,460
The hippopotamus.

3065
02:54:17,460 --> 02:54:19,460
He's a fellow's been hiding all our zoo animals.

3066
02:54:19,460 --> 02:54:21,460
A nice cage lined up for him as well, inspector.

3067
02:54:21,460 --> 02:54:23,460
Oh, so that's your plan, is it?

3068
02:54:23,460 --> 02:54:25,460
Ha, they want to take them all.

3069
02:54:25,460 --> 02:54:27,460
Moomin's, Norkman, Mama, and Papa.

3070
02:54:27,460 --> 02:54:29,460
Hmm, the criminal conspiracy.

3071
02:54:29,460 --> 02:54:30,460
Conspiracy?

3072
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:33,460
It would probably be called kidnapping.

3073
02:54:33,460 --> 02:54:35,460
Once you can't kidnap a hippo.

3074
02:54:35,460 --> 02:54:37,460
That's a movement.

3075
02:54:37,460 --> 02:54:39,460
It could be white slavery, though.

3076
02:54:39,460 --> 02:54:42,460
I'm sure I could add incitement to riot to the list.

3077
02:54:42,460 --> 02:54:45,460
Now I hate paperwork, so I'll tell you one.

3078
02:54:45,460 --> 02:54:47,460
If you're gone within 10 minutes, I won't arrest you.

3079
02:54:47,460 --> 02:54:50,460
Why don't you put them in the deepest dungeon, inspector?

3080
02:54:50,460 --> 02:54:52,460
The one with all the rats and spiders and scorpions

3081
02:54:52,460 --> 02:54:54,460
that'll teach them to put Moomin's encages.

3082
02:54:54,460 --> 02:54:56,460
That's a good idea, little mind.

3083
02:54:56,460 --> 02:54:58,460
They like animals.

3084
02:54:58,460 --> 02:55:01,460
I'll start counting now.

3085
02:55:01,460 --> 02:55:04,460
One, two, three.

3086
02:55:04,460 --> 02:55:05,460
Get around, men.

3087
02:55:05,460 --> 02:55:06,460
Quickly.

3088
02:55:06,460 --> 02:55:07,460
All right.

3089
02:55:07,460 --> 02:55:09,460
We'll have to think quickly on this one, men.

3090
02:55:09,460 --> 02:55:10,460
Come on now.

3091
02:55:10,460 --> 02:55:12,460
Does anybody have any smart ideas?

3092
02:55:12,460 --> 02:55:13,460
Come on.

3093
02:55:13,460 --> 02:55:16,460
We're running out of time.

3094
02:55:16,460 --> 02:55:17,460
One minute.

3095
02:55:17,460 --> 02:55:19,460
Look, guys, we're going to figure something out right now.

3096
02:55:19,460 --> 02:55:20,460
Ready and look.

3097
02:55:20,460 --> 02:55:23,460
One minute, 30 seconds.

3098
02:55:23,460 --> 02:55:24,460
Two minutes.

3099
02:55:24,460 --> 02:55:26,460
Three minutes, 30 seconds.

3100
02:55:26,460 --> 02:55:27,460
Look.

3101
02:55:27,460 --> 02:55:28,460
Leave us alone.

3102
02:55:28,460 --> 02:55:29,460
Way we're conferring.

3103
02:55:29,460 --> 02:55:30,460
All right.

3104
02:55:30,460 --> 02:55:32,460
Six minutes and 50 seconds.

3105
02:55:32,460 --> 02:55:33,460
Time's up.

3106
02:55:33,460 --> 02:55:34,460
You're cheating.

3107
02:55:34,460 --> 02:55:35,460
The police don't cheat.

3108
02:55:35,460 --> 02:55:37,460
And now you've got...

3109
02:55:37,460 --> 02:55:39,460
Nine minutes and 30 seconds.

3110
02:55:39,460 --> 02:55:40,460
How about that?

3111
02:55:40,460 --> 02:55:41,460
Nine minutes, 50 bucks.

3112
02:55:41,460 --> 02:55:42,460
I give up.

3113
02:55:42,460 --> 02:55:44,460
Everybody beat it.

3114
02:55:44,460 --> 02:55:45,460
But we're still discussing it.

3115
02:55:45,460 --> 02:55:46,460
No, we're not.

3116
02:55:46,460 --> 02:55:47,460
We're getting out.

3117
02:55:47,460 --> 02:55:48,460
Look, everyone.

3118
02:55:48,460 --> 02:55:49,460
The zoom in.

3119
02:55:49,460 --> 02:55:51,460
We're running off.

3120
02:55:51,460 --> 02:55:52,460
Great.

3121
02:55:52,460 --> 02:55:55,460
You've got to come and see this, Mama.

3122
02:55:55,460 --> 02:55:57,460
Nine minutes and 50 and a half seconds.

3123
02:55:57,460 --> 02:55:58,460
And don't come back.

3124
02:55:58,460 --> 02:56:00,460
We'll be the dungeon for you.

3125
02:56:00,460 --> 02:56:03,460
And I make that 10 minutes up to you.

3126
02:56:03,460 --> 02:56:04,460
You saved his little mind.

3127
02:56:04,460 --> 02:56:07,460
It was really clever of you to fetch the inspector.

3128
02:56:07,460 --> 02:56:10,460
Well, there were too many of them for me to fight.

3129
02:56:10,460 --> 02:56:11,460
Okay.

3130
02:56:11,460 --> 02:56:12,460
Everyone.

3131
02:56:13,460 --> 02:56:15,460
Help!

3132
02:56:15,460 --> 02:56:18,460
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

3133
02:56:18,460 --> 02:56:20,460
And so everyone was saved.

3134
02:56:20,460 --> 02:56:22,460
And eventually, they all came out of the house

3135
02:56:22,460 --> 02:56:24,460
to go and have fun in the jungle again.

3136
02:56:24,460 --> 02:56:26,460
As long as the warm weather lasted,

3137
02:56:26,460 --> 02:56:28,460
there were plenty of things to do.

3138
02:56:28,460 --> 02:56:30,460
But one day, the weather changed.

3139
02:56:30,460 --> 02:56:33,460
And cold winds blew down Moomin Valley.

3140
02:56:35,460 --> 02:56:38,460
Oh, it feels like autumn has arrived.

3141
02:56:38,460 --> 02:56:40,460
The jungle won't like the cold weather.

3142
02:56:41,460 --> 02:56:43,460
Do you think it will die, Mama?

3143
02:56:43,460 --> 02:56:45,460
I'm afraid it will, little mind.

3144
02:56:45,460 --> 02:56:49,460
It grew very quickly, so perhaps it will go the same way.

3145
02:56:51,460 --> 02:56:52,460
And it did.

3146
02:56:52,460 --> 02:56:56,460
The whole jungle with it and died in just one night.

3147
02:57:02,460 --> 02:57:04,460
I think I've done a cold coming, Mama.

3148
02:57:04,460 --> 02:57:05,460
I'm sorry.

3149
02:57:05,460 --> 02:57:06,460
I can't get the house any hotter.

3150
02:57:06,460 --> 02:57:07,460
I missed the zoo.

3151
02:57:07,460 --> 02:57:09,460
At least it was warm now.

3152
02:57:09,460 --> 02:57:11,460
Yes, this cold is awful.

3153
02:57:11,460 --> 02:57:14,460
It would warm them up if we burned the dead jungle.

3154
02:57:31,460 --> 02:57:32,460
Now they're happy again.

3155
02:57:32,460 --> 02:57:33,460
But for how long?

3156
02:57:40,460 --> 02:57:42,460
Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys.

3157
02:57:42,460 --> 02:57:43,460
It's cold again.

3158
02:57:43,460 --> 02:57:45,460
It was warm in our cages.

3159
02:57:45,460 --> 02:57:47,460
But you're free here.

3160
02:57:47,460 --> 02:57:49,460
Yes, free to have pneumonia.

3161
02:57:49,460 --> 02:57:53,460
I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spanning the winter here.

3162
02:57:53,460 --> 02:57:57,460
Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys.

3163
02:57:57,460 --> 02:57:58,460
It's cold again.

3164
02:57:58,460 --> 02:58:00,460
It was warm in our cages.

3165
02:58:00,460 --> 02:58:02,460
What are you afraid here?

3166
02:58:02,460 --> 02:58:04,460
Yes, free to have pneumonia.

3167
02:58:04,460 --> 02:58:08,460
I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spanning the winter here.

3168
02:58:10,460 --> 02:58:14,460
And so all the animals decided to return to the zoo.

3169
02:58:14,460 --> 02:58:17,460
Perhaps we'll let you come back next summer, Mrs. Snake.

3170
02:58:17,460 --> 02:58:20,460
I like that when it's warmer.

3171
02:58:24,460 --> 02:58:27,460
Hey, look, the animals are on their way back.

3172
02:58:27,460 --> 02:58:29,460
All right.

3173
02:58:29,460 --> 02:58:30,460
That wonderful.

3174
02:58:30,460 --> 02:58:32,460
Oh, it's good to see you.

3175
02:58:32,460 --> 02:58:34,460
You don't know how much we missed you.

3176
02:58:34,460 --> 02:58:36,460
Oh, good.

3177
02:58:36,460 --> 02:58:37,460
Gosh.

3178
02:58:37,460 --> 02:58:39,460
It's good to see you.

3179
02:58:39,460 --> 02:58:40,460
Come on now.

3180
02:58:40,460 --> 02:58:41,460
Get back to your cages quickly.

3181
02:58:41,460 --> 02:58:43,460
We've been keeping them nice and warm for you.

3182
02:58:43,460 --> 02:58:45,460
Go on, off you go now.

3183
02:58:45,460 --> 02:58:48,460
You look all right, but I'm sure you must all be starving.

3184
02:58:48,460 --> 02:58:51,460
We'll do you a special meal tonight.

3185
02:58:51,460 --> 02:58:52,460
All right.

3186
02:58:52,460 --> 02:58:54,460
Ah, the hippos too.

3187
02:58:54,460 --> 02:58:56,460
For the last time, we're moments, not hippos.

3188
02:58:56,460 --> 02:58:57,460
You must be cold as well.

3189
02:58:57,460 --> 02:58:59,460
We'll warm up a cage for you.

3190
02:58:59,460 --> 02:59:01,460
It'll be nice and cozy there.

3191
02:59:01,460 --> 02:59:02,460
No.

3192
02:59:02,460 --> 02:59:04,460
No, it just came to send the animals off.

3193
02:59:04,460 --> 02:59:06,460
Hey, get a cage ready for the hippos.

3194
02:59:06,460 --> 02:59:07,460
Will you?

3195
02:59:07,460 --> 02:59:08,460
Nice and warm.

3196
02:59:08,460 --> 02:59:10,460
At the risk of sounding repetitive.

3197
02:59:10,460 --> 02:59:11,460
We are moments.

3198
02:59:11,460 --> 02:59:12,460
Don't be ridiculous.

3199
02:59:12,460 --> 02:59:14,460
We'll let it here.

3200
02:59:14,460 --> 02:59:16,460
But we're nothing like hippos.

3201
02:59:16,460 --> 02:59:20,460
We know you're not pure breads, but the public will never be able to tell.

3202
02:59:25,460 --> 02:59:28,460
Do we have to stay here forever, Papa?

3203
02:59:28,460 --> 02:59:29,460
Of course not, moment.

3204
02:59:29,460 --> 02:59:30,460
Don't worry.

3205
02:59:30,460 --> 02:59:31,460
I'll think of something.

3206
02:59:31,460 --> 02:59:32,460
You will, won't you?

3207
02:59:32,460 --> 02:59:34,460
Have you got any ideas?

3208
02:59:34,460 --> 02:59:38,460
Well, not yet, but I am a writer, you know.

3209
02:59:42,460 --> 02:59:44,460
Don't cry, Snorth Maiden.

3210
02:59:44,460 --> 02:59:47,460
I'm sure there won't be only hay to eat.

3211
02:59:47,460 --> 02:59:49,460
I don't mind as long as we're together.

3212
02:59:49,460 --> 02:59:52,460
But what if they put us in separate cages?

3213
02:59:52,460 --> 02:59:53,460
No.

3214
02:59:53,460 --> 02:59:54,460
That would be awful.

3215
02:59:54,460 --> 02:59:56,460
They wouldn't do that.

3216
02:59:57,460 --> 03:00:00,460
Well, perhaps the inspector will come looking for us.

3217
03:00:00,460 --> 03:00:03,460
When he realizes that we've gone as well as the animals,

3218
03:00:03,460 --> 03:00:06,460
he'll bring the full power of the Lord to bear on them.

3219
03:00:06,460 --> 03:00:07,460
Oh, look.

3220
03:00:07,460 --> 03:00:08,460
There's someone coming.

3221
03:00:08,460 --> 03:00:09,460
It's Snorthkin.

3222
03:00:09,460 --> 03:00:10,460
And Hamilun.

3223
03:00:10,460 --> 03:00:11,460
And a little Mai.

3224
03:00:11,460 --> 03:00:12,460
Snorthkin.

3225
03:00:15,460 --> 03:00:16,460
Hi, movement.

3226
03:00:16,460 --> 03:00:17,460
Don't worry.

3227
03:00:17,460 --> 03:00:20,460
We'll have you guys out in just a minute.

3228
03:00:23,460 --> 03:00:24,460
Please come out.

3229
03:00:27,460 --> 03:00:30,460
Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to let you out.

3230
03:00:30,460 --> 03:00:32,460
I'm in charge of this zoo.

3231
03:00:32,460 --> 03:00:34,460
I'm afraid it was quite an understandable mistake.

3232
03:00:34,460 --> 03:00:38,460
But please accept this token of apology from the board of trustees.

3233
03:00:38,460 --> 03:00:39,460
Here you are, madam.

3234
03:00:40,460 --> 03:00:43,460
Mr. Hamilun and I went to the Royal Academy of Science

3235
03:00:43,460 --> 03:00:45,460
just to sort all this out.

3236
03:00:45,460 --> 03:00:47,460
We've been given a letter from the President

3237
03:00:47,460 --> 03:00:49,460
stating that you are not hippos.

3238
03:00:49,460 --> 03:00:52,460
Mr. Hamilun's scientific background helped persuade him.

3239
03:00:52,460 --> 03:00:54,460
So you can all come home now.

3240
03:00:55,460 --> 03:00:59,460
Well, it just goes to show you must never judge by appearances alone.

3241
03:01:02,460 --> 03:01:03,460
Mama.

3242
03:01:03,460 --> 03:01:04,460
Yes, Papa.

3243
03:01:04,460 --> 03:01:07,460
Do you think I should grow a beard?

3244
03:01:07,460 --> 03:01:08,460
No, Papa.

3245
03:01:15,460 --> 03:01:18,460
And so autumn came to Moomin Valley.

3246
03:01:18,460 --> 03:01:22,460
A new season with different weather and different pleasures.

3247
03:01:54,460 --> 03:01:57,460
The Moomin's.

3248
03:01:57,460 --> 03:02:02,460
They love the laughter and they love the living.

3249
03:02:02,460 --> 03:02:05,460
The Moomin's.

3250
03:02:05,460 --> 03:02:13,460
You're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

3251
03:02:13,460 --> 03:02:17,460
They're always happy and goes at play.

3252
03:02:17,460 --> 03:02:20,460
The Moomin's are having fun day after day.

3253
03:02:20,460 --> 03:02:24,460
The Moomin's.

3254
03:02:24,460 --> 03:02:27,460
The Moomin's.

3255
03:02:27,460 --> 03:02:34,460
The Moomin's.

3256
03:02:51,460 --> 03:02:56,460
Here they are for one and all.

3257
03:02:56,460 --> 03:02:59,460
The Moomin's are about to come.

3258
03:02:59,460 --> 03:03:02,460
Come on and sit down here with me.

3259
03:03:02,460 --> 03:03:04,460
Therefore you want your TV.

3260
03:03:04,460 --> 03:03:07,460
They are the Moomin's.

3261
03:03:07,460 --> 03:03:10,460
They are the Moomin's.

3262
03:03:10,460 --> 03:03:13,460
So come with me, give me your hand.

3263
03:03:13,460 --> 03:03:16,460
I'll take you up to a Moomin land.

3264
03:03:16,460 --> 03:03:19,460
You can fly just like a bird.

3265
03:03:19,460 --> 03:03:21,460
Sing that song ever.

3266
03:03:21,460 --> 03:03:24,460
There was the Moomin's.

3267
03:03:24,460 --> 03:03:29,460
There was the Moomin's.

3268
03:03:29,460 --> 03:03:32,460
There was the Moomin's.

3269
03:03:32,460 --> 03:03:37,460
There was the Moomin's.

3270
03:03:37,460 --> 03:03:40,460
There was the Moomin's.

3271
03:03:40,460 --> 03:04:10,460
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

3272
03:04:10,460 --> 03:04:40,460
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

3273
03:04:40,460 --> 03:04:43,180
Oh, I'm just taking my brother his lunch little my

3274
03:04:43,180 --> 03:04:47,020
Hmm. He must have nearly finished the flying ship by now

3275
03:04:47,020 --> 03:04:49,980
Oh, no. Not even snork works that quickly

3276
03:04:51,500 --> 03:04:55,980
Well, have you seen it? No, I haven't. He won't even let me come into his workshop

3277
03:04:55,980 --> 03:04:58,140
Is he afraid it'll disappear if someone sees it?

3278
03:04:58,700 --> 03:05:02,940
He hasn't said why but I suppose all great inventors have to be very careful

3279
03:05:02,940 --> 03:05:04,940
Someone might want to steal their ideas

3280
03:05:05,820 --> 03:05:07,820
Moment told me he's dying to have a look at it

3281
03:05:19,260 --> 03:05:23,420
A moment open the door. I've got my hands fall. Come on quickly

3282
03:05:24,940 --> 03:05:27,340
Look what I've got. It's a runner player

3283
03:05:35,740 --> 03:05:42,540
Do you think you can get it working, do you? Oh, yes, of course, Mama

3284
03:05:42,540 --> 03:05:47,660
Why did people always give me things that are broken? It'd be nice to have something that worked for a change

3285
03:05:51,180 --> 03:05:53,260
Moment, Papa will get it working for you

3286
03:05:53,900 --> 03:05:59,900
My auntie said that the record was all right though. It's dance music. She's had it for ages, but I've never heard it

3287
03:05:59,900 --> 03:06:04,060
Oh, that's nice. It's years since I danced but it seems like only yesterday

3288
03:06:04,540 --> 03:06:10,780
Do you remember what funny was papa dancing? Oh, oh, yeah, I see

3289
03:06:11,660 --> 03:06:13,660
Have you fixed it papa?

3290
03:06:21,740 --> 03:06:25,260
Huh, I can hear music doesn't sound like snuffkin

3291
03:06:34,860 --> 03:06:36,860
Oh

3292
03:06:54,540 --> 03:06:58,380
Right have you got the idea now? Yes, I think so

3293
03:06:59,180 --> 03:07:00,940
Me too

3294
03:07:00,940 --> 03:07:03,420
Come on. Well, let's see you then

3295
03:07:06,060 --> 03:07:08,060
Meal?

3296
03:07:08,860 --> 03:07:10,860
Did it

3297
03:07:11,900 --> 03:07:13,900
Oh, wow

3298
03:07:20,620 --> 03:07:23,580
Look at papa moving. He's a great dancer

3299
03:07:24,220 --> 03:07:26,220
Oh

3300
03:07:33,740 --> 03:07:38,300
Well, then can you dance sniff I've never tried right. Well tried now

3301
03:07:47,500 --> 03:07:49,500
Yep

3302
03:07:53,580 --> 03:07:54,580
One day...

3303
03:07:54,580 --> 03:08:02,120
Пол is there it's quite quick!

3304
03:08:02,120 --> 03:08:10,580
Oh that was fun...

3305
03:08:10,580 --> 03:08:16,180
Uh Dad, Saint Neofer, you still have me out like this?

3306
03:08:16,180 --> 03:08:18,380
You've got no sense of rhythm at all, sneak!

3307
03:08:18,380 --> 03:08:22,840
I can still dance though can I?

3308
03:08:22,840 --> 03:08:24,280
Oh, are you ready, Papa?

3309
03:08:24,280 --> 03:08:26,380
Well, I think I'll have to sit this one out, Mama.

3310
03:08:26,380 --> 03:08:27,220
All right.

3311
03:08:31,400 --> 03:08:33,080
No, Mom, no, thank you.

3312
03:08:33,080 --> 03:08:34,160
I'll dance on my own.

3313
03:08:34,160 --> 03:08:34,960
Well, then.

3314
03:08:34,960 --> 03:08:37,160
Why don't you dance with me and dance, Smith?

3315
03:08:37,160 --> 03:08:38,000
Ah.

3316
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:55,640
Oh, it looks like it's here for the day.

3317
03:08:55,640 --> 03:09:07,280
Oh, what horrible weather, Snuffkin.

3318
03:09:07,280 --> 03:09:09,160
Yes.

3319
03:09:09,160 --> 03:09:10,760
They're having fun.

3320
03:09:10,760 --> 03:09:14,480
Well, Smith brought this old record player over, and we've been dancing.

3321
03:09:14,480 --> 03:09:16,400
I haven't done it for years and years.

3322
03:09:16,400 --> 03:09:18,040
And, well, aren't you coming in?

3323
03:09:18,040 --> 03:09:20,600
I can smell winter in the air, Moomin, Papa.

3324
03:09:20,600 --> 03:09:22,640
Huh?

3325
03:09:22,640 --> 03:09:24,640
Oh, yes, you're right.

3326
03:09:31,840 --> 03:09:33,240
Snuffkin, hi.

3327
03:09:38,280 --> 03:09:41,000
Snuffkin, come and dance with me.

3328
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:42,600
No, thanks, I'm fine.

3329
03:09:42,600 --> 03:09:49,600
Sorry.

3330
03:09:49,600 --> 03:09:51,400
I'm sorry.

3331
03:09:51,400 --> 03:09:59,400
Oh, you.

3332
03:09:59,400 --> 03:10:07,200
Hmm, what's the matter with this, huh?

3333
03:10:07,200 --> 03:10:08,480
I'm afraid it's broken.

3334
03:10:08,480 --> 03:10:10,360
Just when we were having so much fun.

3335
03:10:10,360 --> 03:10:12,920
Will you be able to fix it again, dear?

3336
03:10:12,920 --> 03:10:14,880
No, even I can't mend it now.

3337
03:10:14,880 --> 03:10:17,320
Oh, please, try, Papa, will you?

3338
03:10:17,320 --> 03:10:21,960
Hmm, Snuffkin, do you know anything about record players?

3339
03:10:21,960 --> 03:10:23,120
No, I'm afraid not.

3340
03:10:23,120 --> 03:10:24,080
Oh, dear.

3341
03:10:24,080 --> 03:10:25,560
But what?

3342
03:10:25,560 --> 03:10:28,120
I'll play my harmonic if you want to continue to dance,

3343
03:10:28,120 --> 03:10:30,040
and then you can fiddle around with the machine.

3344
03:10:30,040 --> 03:10:31,240
How would that be?

3345
03:10:31,240 --> 03:10:32,520
Oh, yes, please.

3346
03:10:32,520 --> 03:10:34,040
That'd be great, Snuffkin.

3347
03:10:34,040 --> 03:10:35,320
Thanks.

3348
03:10:35,320 --> 03:10:37,600
Now then, what would be a good tune to dance to?

3349
03:10:37,600 --> 03:10:38,360
Let's see.

3350
03:11:05,320 --> 03:11:17,400
Now what's this, oh, oh, oh, no, I give up.

3351
03:11:17,400 --> 03:11:20,640
May I?

3352
03:11:20,640 --> 03:11:43,960
You're thinking about going away again, aren't you, Snuffkin?

3353
03:11:43,960 --> 03:11:44,960
Hmm.

3354
03:11:44,960 --> 03:11:49,440
I know that you go south every year when winter comes, but I'll still miss you, though,

3355
03:11:49,440 --> 03:11:52,640
and I wish you could stay here in Moomin Valley.

3356
03:11:52,640 --> 03:11:56,440
I know, Moomin.

3357
03:11:56,440 --> 03:12:04,000
Who are they?

3358
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:05,240
How do you fathomers, I think?

3359
03:12:05,240 --> 03:12:07,240
I wonder where they're going.

3360
03:12:07,240 --> 03:12:08,240
I don't know.

3361
03:12:08,240 --> 03:12:11,240
A deserted island, I expect.

3362
03:12:11,240 --> 03:12:14,960
Probably the best place for them.

3363
03:12:14,960 --> 03:12:16,960
When are you leaving, Snuffkin?

3364
03:12:16,960 --> 03:12:19,120
Oh, I haven't decided yet.

3365
03:12:19,120 --> 03:12:22,720
So you'll be here for a bit longer, then.

3366
03:12:22,720 --> 03:12:24,880
Do you know where you're going?

3367
03:12:24,880 --> 03:12:25,880
No.

3368
03:12:25,880 --> 03:12:27,720
It must be fun traveling.

3369
03:12:27,720 --> 03:12:30,720
Yes, most of the time.

3370
03:12:30,720 --> 03:12:34,120
It's the best way of meeting new people and still being on your own.

3371
03:12:34,120 --> 03:12:38,760
I wish we could do that, but even when we hibernate and go to sleep, we're never really

3372
03:12:38,760 --> 03:12:39,760
alone.

3373
03:12:39,760 --> 03:12:43,560
I guess I'd hibernate too if I had to stay up here in Moomin, during all the freezing

3374
03:12:43,560 --> 03:12:50,840
winter snows.

3375
03:12:50,840 --> 03:12:58,720
Do you think I could go south with Snuffkin, Papa?

3376
03:12:58,720 --> 03:12:59,720
Not really.

3377
03:12:59,720 --> 03:13:02,720
It's the moment way to hibernate.

3378
03:13:02,720 --> 03:13:07,080
It's a family custom passed down through the years by our ancestors.

3379
03:13:07,080 --> 03:13:09,840
But Papa, I don't want to go to sleep for months on end.

3380
03:13:09,840 --> 03:13:12,240
I want to travel south with Snuffkin.

3381
03:13:12,280 --> 03:13:17,320
Oh, Moomin, you promise you'll be back on the first day of spring.

3382
03:13:17,320 --> 03:13:18,520
Oh, Mama!

3383
03:13:18,520 --> 03:13:21,440
Does that mean I can really go?

3384
03:13:21,440 --> 03:13:23,280
I can't wait to tell Snuffkin.

3385
03:13:23,280 --> 03:13:24,760
I can, can't I?

3386
03:13:24,760 --> 03:13:28,080
Well, if you really want to, I don't suppose we'll stop you.

3387
03:13:28,080 --> 03:13:30,280
Will we, Papa?

3388
03:13:30,280 --> 03:13:33,880
Now, my parents didn't mind when I traveled around in my youth.

3389
03:13:33,880 --> 03:13:35,880
So yes, all right, Moomin.

3390
03:13:35,880 --> 03:13:37,480
Oh, thank you, Mama.

3391
03:13:37,480 --> 03:13:40,360
Oh, thank you, Mama.

3392
03:13:40,360 --> 03:13:42,600
That's great, but why won't Snuffkin say?

3393
03:13:50,080 --> 03:13:52,280
Well, it's a good idea.

3394
03:13:52,280 --> 03:13:55,120
And I got to say it'd be fun to have you along, Moomin.

3395
03:13:55,120 --> 03:13:58,520
So I can come with you, Snuffkin?

3396
03:13:58,520 --> 03:13:59,480
No.

3397
03:13:59,480 --> 03:14:00,560
What?

3398
03:14:00,560 --> 03:14:03,720
I'm sorry, but I've got to go on my own.

3399
03:14:03,720 --> 03:14:05,000
Don't be disappointed, Moomin.

3400
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:07,080
I told you I travel alone.

3401
03:14:07,080 --> 03:14:08,040
I need to.

3402
03:14:08,040 --> 03:14:09,680
After spending the rest of the year here,

3403
03:14:09,680 --> 03:14:12,640
just as I need to be here, after spending the winter alone,

3404
03:14:12,640 --> 03:14:14,640
and the joy of returning to Moomin Valley

3405
03:14:14,640 --> 03:14:16,080
is something I wouldn't miss.

3406
03:14:16,080 --> 03:14:18,360
Which Snuffkin, I thought.

3407
03:14:18,360 --> 03:14:20,160
The time will soon pass, and you'll

3408
03:14:20,160 --> 03:14:22,120
be asleep through most of it.

3409
03:14:22,120 --> 03:14:23,760
You won't notice I'm not here.

3410
03:14:23,760 --> 03:14:26,720
I'll see you next spring, Moomin.

3411
03:14:26,720 --> 03:14:28,800
I'll be back on the first day as usual.

3412
03:14:28,800 --> 03:14:31,600
I promise, as soon as the weather warns.

3413
03:14:31,600 --> 03:14:33,520
And when the flowers start to grow, nothing

3414
03:14:33,520 --> 03:14:35,000
will keep me from Moomin Valley.

3415
03:14:38,560 --> 03:14:41,880
I'm sorry, I didn't work out for you, Moomin.

3416
03:14:41,880 --> 03:14:43,320
Oh, it's all right.

3417
03:14:43,320 --> 03:14:45,760
Oh, come on, Moomin.

3418
03:14:45,760 --> 03:14:47,480
You'll have to tie them a bit tighter than that.

3419
03:15:08,520 --> 03:15:11,280
It'll be a cold winter, so we'll need lots of wood

3420
03:15:11,280 --> 03:15:13,320
to keep us going till spring comes.

3421
03:15:13,320 --> 03:15:14,000
I know.

3422
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:17,440
Now you want to stay warm, don't you?

3423
03:15:17,440 --> 03:15:20,720
When I grow up, I'll go south for my own, too.

3424
03:15:20,720 --> 03:15:22,560
Yes, of course you will.

3425
03:15:39,040 --> 03:15:41,960
It's Moomin home.

3426
03:15:41,960 --> 03:15:43,920
Yes?

3427
03:15:43,920 --> 03:15:45,080
How is he?

3428
03:15:45,080 --> 03:15:46,960
Is he still down in the dumps?

3429
03:15:46,960 --> 03:15:47,920
I'm afraid so.

3430
03:15:47,920 --> 03:15:50,440
Grandma's cheer you up recipe didn't work.

3431
03:15:50,440 --> 03:15:53,960
Oh, I think he's being silly just because Snuffkin's

3432
03:15:53,960 --> 03:15:54,640
going away.

3433
03:15:54,640 --> 03:15:56,440
I suppose he is.

3434
03:15:56,440 --> 03:15:58,920
But don't worry, Mama.

3435
03:15:58,920 --> 03:16:00,600
He won't be miserable much longer,

3436
03:16:00,600 --> 03:16:02,400
because I've got a surprise for him.

3437
03:16:08,040 --> 03:16:15,040
Are you there, Moomin?

3438
03:16:15,040 --> 03:16:17,040
Oh, Moomin, don't cry.

3439
03:16:17,040 --> 03:16:19,040
Boys don't cry, I suppose.

3440
03:16:19,040 --> 03:16:20,040
Of course they do.

3441
03:16:20,040 --> 03:16:22,040
Well, I'm not crying, so they're...

3442
03:16:22,040 --> 03:16:23,040
All right.

3443
03:16:23,040 --> 03:16:25,040
But I do think you should get up now.

3444
03:16:25,040 --> 03:16:27,040
Oh, and why should I?

3445
03:16:27,040 --> 03:16:29,040
I have a surprise for you.

3446
03:16:29,040 --> 03:16:31,040
I don't want any surprises.

3447
03:16:31,040 --> 03:16:33,040
Oh, Moomin, don't cry.

3448
03:16:33,040 --> 03:16:35,040
Boys don't cry, I suppose.

3449
03:16:35,040 --> 03:16:36,040
Of course they do.

3450
03:16:36,040 --> 03:16:37,040
Well, I'm not crying, so they're...

3451
03:16:37,040 --> 03:16:38,040
They don't want any surprises.

3452
03:16:38,040 --> 03:16:42,040
Come on, I'm going to go and see Snuffkin his workshop.

3453
03:16:42,040 --> 03:16:44,040
But you know he won't let us in.

3454
03:16:44,040 --> 03:16:45,040
I've tried before.

3455
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:46,040
Oh, yes.

3456
03:16:46,040 --> 03:16:47,040
He will today.

3457
03:16:47,040 --> 03:16:48,040
I promise.

3458
03:16:48,040 --> 03:16:49,040
What?

3459
03:16:49,040 --> 03:16:52,040
You mean Snuffkin shows his flying ship a glass?

3460
03:16:52,040 --> 03:16:53,040
Yes, he says.

3461
03:16:53,040 --> 03:16:55,040
Has he really finished it then?

3462
03:16:55,040 --> 03:16:57,040
No, not yet.

3463
03:16:57,040 --> 03:16:59,040
There's still a lot of work to do on it.

3464
03:16:59,040 --> 03:17:01,040
Then I wonder why he's letting us see it.

3465
03:17:01,040 --> 03:17:03,040
He's always refused before.

3466
03:17:03,040 --> 03:17:05,040
What's made him change his mind?

3467
03:17:05,040 --> 03:17:07,040
But I asked him this time.

3468
03:17:07,040 --> 03:17:09,040
I said I wanted to show it to you.

3469
03:17:09,040 --> 03:17:10,040
It just needed a woman's touch.

3470
03:17:10,040 --> 03:17:12,040
What did you say to him?

3471
03:17:12,040 --> 03:17:14,040
First he said absolutely not.

3472
03:17:14,040 --> 03:17:16,040
But when I told him how ill you were in that

3473
03:17:16,040 --> 03:17:18,040
you probably wouldn't be with us much longer.

3474
03:17:18,040 --> 03:17:20,040
He gave in and said we could see it.

3475
03:17:20,040 --> 03:17:21,040
Just you and me of course.

3476
03:17:21,040 --> 03:17:23,040
I'm not that ill snorke maiden.

3477
03:17:23,040 --> 03:17:24,040
Oh good.

3478
03:17:24,040 --> 03:17:26,040
Because sometimes when people are very depressed

3479
03:17:26,040 --> 03:17:29,040
and just lying bad, they've done something bad.

3480
03:17:29,040 --> 03:17:32,040
Oh stop it snorke maiden, don't say things like that.

3481
03:17:36,040 --> 03:17:38,040
I'm only trying to cheer you up.

3482
03:17:38,040 --> 03:17:40,040
So remember, don't tell us all.

3483
03:17:40,040 --> 03:17:42,040
No one else must know anything about it.

3484
03:17:42,040 --> 03:17:43,040
Okay.

3485
03:17:51,040 --> 03:17:52,040
Let's go.

3486
03:17:53,040 --> 03:17:54,040
No.

3487
03:17:58,040 --> 03:17:59,040
Oh little my.

3488
03:17:59,040 --> 03:18:00,040
Little my.

3489
03:18:00,040 --> 03:18:01,040
Trouble.

3490
03:18:01,040 --> 03:18:02,040
Big Trouble.

3491
03:18:02,040 --> 03:18:03,040
We must fool her.

3492
03:18:03,040 --> 03:18:04,040
Yes but how?

3493
03:18:04,040 --> 03:18:05,040
What can we do?

3494
03:18:06,040 --> 03:18:08,040
I know what we'll do.

3495
03:18:08,040 --> 03:18:09,040
What?

3496
03:18:09,040 --> 03:18:10,040
Quick movement.

3497
03:18:10,040 --> 03:18:13,040
You just agree with everything I say snorke maiden.

3498
03:18:13,040 --> 03:18:14,040
Oh.

3499
03:18:14,040 --> 03:18:17,040
I know what we'll do.

3500
03:18:17,040 --> 03:18:18,040
Quick movement.

3501
03:18:18,040 --> 03:18:21,040
You just agree with everything I say snorke maiden.

3502
03:18:21,040 --> 03:18:22,040
Oh.

3503
03:18:22,040 --> 03:18:25,040
I thought you were in bad movement.

3504
03:18:25,040 --> 03:18:26,040
No.

3505
03:18:26,040 --> 03:18:27,040
We're going to see snorke.

3506
03:18:27,040 --> 03:18:28,040
Yes.

3507
03:18:28,040 --> 03:18:29,040
Really?

3508
03:18:29,040 --> 03:18:30,040
Yes.

3509
03:18:30,040 --> 03:18:32,040
She needs to clear a runway for when the flying ship is finished.

3510
03:18:32,040 --> 03:18:33,040
We're going to help him do it.

3511
03:18:33,040 --> 03:18:34,040
That's all.

3512
03:18:34,040 --> 03:18:35,040
Yes.

3513
03:18:35,040 --> 03:18:36,040
Are you really moving?

3514
03:18:36,040 --> 03:18:38,040
You got out of bed to do that.

3515
03:18:38,040 --> 03:18:41,040
I'm afraid I find it very strange that snorke is asked to go along

3516
03:18:41,040 --> 03:18:44,040
and help him cut down bushes and dig up roots and things.

3517
03:18:44,040 --> 03:18:47,040
You might have noticed I'm not a complete fool.

3518
03:18:47,040 --> 03:18:48,040
But it's true little my.

3519
03:18:48,040 --> 03:18:49,040
Oh, yes.

3520
03:18:49,040 --> 03:18:51,040
Well, at least you could have invented a better lie.

3521
03:18:51,040 --> 03:18:56,040
You must think I'm pretty stupid to believe a pathetic story like that.

3522
03:18:56,040 --> 03:18:57,040
But it's the truth.

3523
03:18:57,040 --> 03:18:59,040
And we need your help.

3524
03:18:59,040 --> 03:19:00,040
Yeah.

3525
03:19:00,040 --> 03:19:01,040
Don't bother, don't bother.

3526
03:19:01,040 --> 03:19:02,040
I don't want to hear anymore.

3527
03:19:02,040 --> 03:19:05,040
I think it's very sad that you have to pretend.

3528
03:19:05,040 --> 03:19:07,040
You're trying to hide something from me.

3529
03:19:07,040 --> 03:19:10,040
And I'm not interested in what sort of sneaky underhanded thing it is.

3530
03:19:10,040 --> 03:19:11,040
But little my.

3531
03:19:11,040 --> 03:19:12,040
No buts.

3532
03:19:12,040 --> 03:19:16,040
And anyway, I'm a little too busy at the moment to take any notice of what's going on.

3533
03:19:16,040 --> 03:19:17,040
Bye.

3534
03:19:17,040 --> 03:19:18,040
Come on.

3535
03:19:18,040 --> 03:19:19,040
Phew.

3536
03:19:19,040 --> 03:19:20,040
That was close.

3537
03:19:20,040 --> 03:19:21,040
Yeah.

3538
03:19:21,040 --> 03:19:22,040
Ha.

3539
03:19:22,040 --> 03:19:23,040
Think, thank you.

3540
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:26,040
Keep a secret from me, do they?

3541
03:19:26,040 --> 03:19:27,040
Ha.

3542
03:19:27,040 --> 03:19:28,040
Ha.

3543
03:19:28,040 --> 03:19:29,040
Ha.

3544
03:19:29,040 --> 03:19:30,040
Ha.

3545
03:19:30,040 --> 03:19:31,040
Think, thank you.

3546
03:19:31,040 --> 03:19:33,040
Keep a secret from me, do they?

3547
03:19:33,040 --> 03:19:34,040
Ha.

3548
03:19:34,040 --> 03:19:35,040
Ha.

3549
03:19:35,040 --> 03:19:36,040
Ha.

3550
03:19:36,040 --> 03:19:37,040
Ha.

3551
03:19:37,040 --> 03:19:38,040
Ha.

3552
03:19:38,040 --> 03:19:39,040
Ha.

3553
03:19:39,040 --> 03:19:40,040
Ha.

3554
03:19:40,040 --> 03:19:41,040
Ha.

3555
03:19:41,040 --> 03:19:42,040
Ha.

3556
03:19:42,040 --> 03:19:43,040
Ha.

3557
03:19:43,040 --> 03:19:44,040
Ha.

3558
03:19:44,040 --> 03:19:45,040
Ha.

3559
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:46,040
Of course we are.

3560
03:19:46,040 --> 03:19:49,040
I promised, didn't I?

3561
03:19:49,040 --> 03:19:52,040
Come in, then.

3562
03:19:52,040 --> 03:19:59,040
Wow.

3563
03:19:59,040 --> 03:20:08,040
It's nearly ready, isn't it?

3564
03:20:08,040 --> 03:20:10,040
Oh no, there's a lot more to do.

3565
03:20:10,040 --> 03:20:12,040
The machine isn't half finished yet.

3566
03:20:12,040 --> 03:20:19,040
And as you can see, there's a lot to do on the ship itself, but I'm getting there slowly.

3567
03:20:19,040 --> 03:20:23,040
I never thought it would be so fantastic, smork.

3568
03:20:23,040 --> 03:20:28,040
Well, I suppose you could say the design wasn't a complete failure.

3569
03:20:28,040 --> 03:20:31,040
I'm quite sure it'll fly beautifully.

3570
03:20:31,040 --> 03:20:32,040
Oh, thank you.

3571
03:20:32,040 --> 03:20:35,040
Do you really think it will, woman?

3572
03:20:35,040 --> 03:20:36,040
I can see it now.

3573
03:20:36,040 --> 03:20:41,040
High up in the air, dodging in and out of the clouds, way up above the world.

3574
03:20:41,040 --> 03:20:45,040
Well, I'm glad to see that you're so perceptive and quite right.

3575
03:20:45,040 --> 03:20:47,040
Oh, how very thoughtful of me.

3576
03:20:47,040 --> 03:20:49,040
Shouldn't you sit down and rest?

3577
03:20:49,040 --> 03:20:50,040
You know, you're illness.

3578
03:20:50,040 --> 03:20:52,040
It doesn't help to get too excited.

3579
03:20:52,040 --> 03:20:53,040
Ha.

3580
03:20:53,040 --> 03:20:54,040
I shouldn't worry, Snork.

3581
03:20:54,040 --> 03:20:56,040
There's nothing wrong with him.

3582
03:20:56,040 --> 03:20:59,040
Oh, little my.

3583
03:20:59,040 --> 03:21:00,040
How did you get in here?

3584
03:21:00,040 --> 03:21:02,040
Throw that door.

3585
03:21:02,040 --> 03:21:03,040
But I always keep it.

3586
03:21:03,040 --> 03:21:06,040
Oh, oh, oh, no.

3587
03:21:06,040 --> 03:21:09,040
I must have forgotten to lock it.

3588
03:21:09,040 --> 03:21:12,040
And it's a bit late to do it now, isn't it?

3589
03:21:12,040 --> 03:21:13,040
But don't worry.

3590
03:21:13,040 --> 03:21:16,040
If I wanted to get in, I'd get in locks or no locks.

3591
03:21:16,040 --> 03:21:18,040
Oh, you lied to us, little my.

3592
03:21:18,040 --> 03:21:19,040
Of course, but so did you.

3593
03:21:19,040 --> 03:21:21,040
Telling me that stupid story.

3594
03:21:21,040 --> 03:21:23,040
Now we're even, right?

3595
03:21:23,040 --> 03:21:25,040
Now, listen, little my.

3596
03:21:25,040 --> 03:21:27,040
Don't ever tell anybody what you see over here.

3597
03:21:27,040 --> 03:21:29,040
All right.

3598
03:21:29,040 --> 03:21:31,040
Ha.

3599
03:21:31,040 --> 03:21:38,040
This invention contains so many outstanding new features it is difficult to know where to begin.

3600
03:21:39,040 --> 03:21:48,040
But let me start with the most exciting part of the whole construction.

3601
03:21:48,040 --> 03:21:58,040
It began as a dream or rather the concept of a dream, thrilling, beautiful, impossible, dangerous.

3602
03:22:09,040 --> 03:22:11,040
Oh.

3603
03:22:23,040 --> 03:22:25,040
Can you take the ship down, movement?

3604
03:22:25,040 --> 03:22:28,040
I'd like you to land at that side of the lake.

3605
03:22:28,040 --> 03:22:30,040
Oh, why do you want to get off?

3606
03:22:30,040 --> 03:22:33,040
Aren't you having fun flying about up here?

3607
03:22:33,040 --> 03:22:35,040
I want to be on my own.

3608
03:22:35,040 --> 03:22:37,040
Oh, please stay here.

3609
03:22:37,040 --> 03:22:39,040
I'll let you steer if you want.

3610
03:22:39,040 --> 03:22:41,040
No, really, movement, please.

3611
03:22:41,040 --> 03:22:43,040
Bye now.

3612
03:22:43,040 --> 03:22:45,040
No!

3613
03:22:48,040 --> 03:22:51,040
Snuff me!

3614
03:22:54,040 --> 03:22:56,040
Ugh!

3615
03:23:08,040 --> 03:23:10,040
So long then, movement, my friend.

3616
03:23:10,040 --> 03:23:12,040
I'll see you again next year.

3617
03:23:12,040 --> 03:23:15,040
The first day of spring.

3618
03:23:38,040 --> 03:23:41,040
Goodbye, then, Snuffkin.

3619
03:24:02,040 --> 03:24:04,040
Off for the winter, Asian Afghan.

3620
03:24:04,040 --> 03:24:05,040
Yes.

3621
03:24:05,040 --> 03:24:06,040
Goodbye, Mr. Hemilan.

3622
03:24:06,040 --> 03:24:09,040
We'll be seeing you in the spring.

3623
03:24:09,040 --> 03:24:12,040
Yes, when the snows are gone.

3624
03:24:18,040 --> 03:24:22,040
Oh, to be young and follow the sun wherever it goes.

3625
03:24:22,040 --> 03:24:25,040
And so the snow fell, and winter came to movement valley.

3626
03:24:25,040 --> 03:24:28,040
And in movement's hearts, Snuffkin and the spring

3627
03:24:28,040 --> 03:24:31,040
seemed a long, long way away.

3628
03:24:31,040 --> 03:24:36,040
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living,

3629
03:24:36,040 --> 03:24:38,040
the woman.

3630
03:24:38,040 --> 03:24:41,040
And so the snow fell, and winter came to movement valley.

3631
03:24:41,040 --> 03:24:44,040
And in movement's hearts, Snuffkin and the spring

3632
03:24:44,040 --> 03:24:47,040
seemed a long, long way away.

3633
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:50,040
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living,

3634
03:24:50,040 --> 03:24:53,040
the woman.

3635
03:24:53,040 --> 03:24:57,040
Believing in sharing and caring and giving,

3636
03:24:57,040 --> 03:25:01,040
the woman.

3637
03:25:01,040 --> 03:25:05,040
They're always happy, and always at play.

3638
03:25:05,040 --> 03:25:08,040
The women are having fun day after day.

3639
03:25:08,040 --> 03:25:12,040
The woman.

3640
03:25:12,040 --> 03:25:16,040
The woman.

3641
03:25:16,040 --> 03:25:19,040
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living,

3642
03:25:19,040 --> 03:25:23,040
the woman.

3643
03:25:23,040 --> 03:25:27,040
Believing in sharing and caring and giving,

3644
03:25:27,040 --> 03:25:31,040
the woman.

3645
03:25:31,040 --> 03:25:34,040
They're always happy, and always at play.

3646
03:25:34,040 --> 03:25:38,040
The women are having fun day after day.

3647
03:25:38,040 --> 03:25:42,040
The woman.

3648
03:25:42,040 --> 03:25:45,040
The woman.

3649
03:25:45,040 --> 03:25:52,040
The woman.

3650
03:26:10,040 --> 03:26:13,040
Here they are for one another.

3651
03:26:13,040 --> 03:26:16,040
The movements are about to come.

3652
03:26:16,040 --> 03:26:19,040
Come on and sit down here with me.

3653
03:26:19,040 --> 03:26:22,040
Here for you on your TV.

3654
03:26:22,040 --> 03:26:25,040
They are the movements.

3655
03:26:25,040 --> 03:26:28,040
They are the movements.

3656
03:26:28,040 --> 03:26:31,040
So come with me, give me your hand.

3657
03:26:31,040 --> 03:26:34,040
I'll take you up to a moment land.

3658
03:26:34,040 --> 03:26:37,040
You can fly just like a bird.

3659
03:26:37,040 --> 03:26:39,040
Sing that song ever.

3660
03:26:39,040 --> 03:26:42,040
There were the movements.

3661
03:26:42,040 --> 03:26:49,040
There were the movements.

3662
03:26:49,040 --> 03:26:56,040
There were the movements.

3663
03:26:56,040 --> 03:27:26,040
Bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat

3664
03:27:26,040 --> 03:27:56,040
bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat

3665
03:27:56,040 --> 03:28:01,120
on everything, waiting until they all wake up again at the first day of spring and start

3666
03:28:01,120 --> 03:28:08,080
to get everything in movement house clean and ready for the coming summer.

3667
03:28:08,080 --> 03:28:19,040
But what's this?

3668
03:28:19,040 --> 03:28:22,920
It looks like movement as restless as if something has disturbed him.

3669
03:28:22,920 --> 03:28:32,440
I wonder what he was dreaming about.

3670
03:28:32,440 --> 03:28:37,680
I wonder what time it is.

3671
03:28:37,680 --> 03:28:41,320
Oh, it's nearly 20 after two.

3672
03:28:41,320 --> 03:28:44,600
Wonder whether it's morning or afternoon.

3673
03:28:44,600 --> 03:28:46,720
It doesn't really matter, I suppose.

3674
03:28:46,720 --> 03:28:47,720
Oh, it stopped.

3675
03:28:53,320 --> 03:28:55,800
Oh, it's frozen.

3676
03:28:55,800 --> 03:28:59,920
It looks really dark out there.

3677
03:29:13,320 --> 03:29:17,520
Mama, Mama, please wake up.

3678
03:29:17,520 --> 03:29:26,160
Papa, Papa, Mama, Mama, Mama, what's wrong with me?

3679
03:29:26,160 --> 03:29:28,160
I feel way too weak.

3680
03:29:28,160 --> 03:29:52,160
It's very odd, I don't usually wake up when I'm hibernating.

3681
03:29:52,160 --> 03:30:07,160
Oh, dear, the whole house is buried in snow.

3682
03:30:07,160 --> 03:30:37,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

3683
03:30:37,160 --> 03:30:48,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

3684
03:31:07,160 --> 03:31:22,760
what was that perhaps I better go home no what's the matter with me everyone's

3685
03:31:22,760 --> 03:31:28,160
asleep and the furniture's all covered up and movements don't give up

3686
03:31:37,160 --> 03:31:45,080
I wish Northkin were here he's probably in the far south where it's warm and

3687
03:31:45,080 --> 03:31:47,400
sunny

3688
03:32:08,160 --> 03:32:12,160
I wonder what that is

3689
03:32:12,160 --> 03:32:14,160
oh

3690
03:32:34,060 --> 03:32:36,960
that sounds like

3691
03:32:36,960 --> 03:32:41,200
Oh, he has his little mind.

3692
03:32:41,200 --> 03:32:44,240
By the bobo, what are you doing here, Moomin?

3693
03:32:44,240 --> 03:32:45,760
What am I doing here?

3694
03:32:45,760 --> 03:32:50,440
I heard strange noises and came to see what it was, then you crashed into me like an avalanche

3695
03:32:50,440 --> 03:32:52,360
and I've just lifted the box off you.

3696
03:32:52,360 --> 03:32:53,960
Oh, don't be stupid, Moomin.

3697
03:32:53,960 --> 03:32:57,600
I mean, why are you out in the snow and not hibernating like the others?

3698
03:32:57,600 --> 03:32:58,960
Spring's not for ages.

3699
03:32:58,960 --> 03:33:00,680
Oh, I don't know.

3700
03:33:00,680 --> 03:33:03,240
I just woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.

3701
03:33:03,320 --> 03:33:07,160
What about you, sliding about like that, you should be asleep too.

3702
03:33:07,160 --> 03:33:09,560
Yes, I should, but I just woke up as well.

3703
03:33:09,560 --> 03:33:11,000
Probably to look after you.

3704
03:33:11,000 --> 03:33:14,200
I tried to wake my stupid sister, but she kept on snoring.

3705
03:33:14,200 --> 03:33:16,520
But I think this snow is really great.

3706
03:33:16,520 --> 03:33:17,800
Well, I don't.

3707
03:33:17,800 --> 03:33:23,160
It's cold, it's slippy, much too bright, and it's everywhere and far too quiet.

3708
03:33:23,160 --> 03:33:24,920
I saw the grok.

3709
03:33:24,920 --> 03:33:26,280
Huh?

3710
03:33:26,280 --> 03:33:28,840
That horrible freezing monster?

3711
03:33:28,840 --> 03:33:32,920
She should feel at home in this and there's no point in her trying to freeze anything.

3712
03:33:32,920 --> 03:33:34,440
I saw her on the hill.

3713
03:33:34,440 --> 03:33:36,200
Then it was her voice, I heard.

3714
03:33:36,200 --> 03:33:39,080
Yes, and the trouble with the horrid thing is that she's so cold,

3715
03:33:39,080 --> 03:33:41,480
I wouldn't even want to touch her, Moomin.

3716
03:33:41,480 --> 03:33:42,280
Huh?

3717
03:33:42,280 --> 03:33:43,160
It's her!

3718
03:33:53,160 --> 03:33:55,000
I'm getting cold shivers all over.

3719
03:33:55,000 --> 03:33:57,160
Well, why do you expect in the snow?

3720
03:33:57,160 --> 03:33:58,520
No, it's the grok's fault.

3721
03:33:58,520 --> 03:33:59,320
She's done it.

3722
03:33:59,320 --> 03:34:01,640
Look at my skin, it's all goose bumpy.

3723
03:34:01,720 --> 03:34:05,800
It's not like that in the summer, it's smooth, not lumpy.

3724
03:34:05,800 --> 03:34:09,480
It's not the snow that makes me feel so cold, it's her staring at me.

3725
03:34:09,480 --> 03:34:10,200
I'm scared.

3726
03:34:18,920 --> 03:34:20,280
That was great.

3727
03:34:20,280 --> 03:34:21,320
Good, isn't it?

3728
03:34:21,320 --> 03:34:22,920
You can have as much as you like.

3729
03:34:22,920 --> 03:34:25,080
We picked more raspberries than ever this year,

3730
03:34:25,080 --> 03:34:27,400
and Mama made lots of juice.

3731
03:34:27,400 --> 03:34:28,680
Thanks.

3732
03:34:28,680 --> 03:34:30,200
Oh.

3733
03:34:30,440 --> 03:34:32,280
Ah, I want that.

3734
03:34:34,200 --> 03:34:35,880
Mama's silver tray?

3735
03:34:35,880 --> 03:34:36,360
Yeah.

3736
03:34:36,360 --> 03:34:37,720
What do you want it for?

3737
03:34:37,720 --> 03:34:40,600
To slide on the snow with a coarse stupid.

3738
03:34:40,600 --> 03:34:43,240
But it's a sort of family treasure in heirloom.

3739
03:34:43,240 --> 03:34:46,360
Well, you never use it and it's so shiny.

3740
03:34:46,360 --> 03:34:49,480
It'll make a great sled and go really fast.

3741
03:34:55,800 --> 03:34:58,120
Doesn't look like they'll wake up till spring.

3742
03:34:58,120 --> 03:35:00,120
They're lucky, they're still sleeping.

3743
03:35:00,120 --> 03:35:02,600
I think it's very unfair that I woke up like this.

3744
03:35:06,280 --> 03:35:08,120
So, what should we do now?

3745
03:35:08,120 --> 03:35:10,040
I want to go look at the sea.

3746
03:35:10,040 --> 03:35:11,240
Good idea.

3747
03:35:11,240 --> 03:35:12,920
At least that won't be covered in snow.

3748
03:35:26,520 --> 03:35:28,760
I bet the great cold was just like this.

3749
03:35:30,840 --> 03:35:34,600
Oh, no.

3750
03:35:34,600 --> 03:35:35,560
What's the matter?

3751
03:35:35,560 --> 03:35:36,840
I forgot the tray.

3752
03:35:36,840 --> 03:35:37,560
Never mind.

3753
03:35:37,560 --> 03:35:39,800
You couldn't use it as a boat anyway, it would sink.

3754
03:35:40,440 --> 03:35:41,480
Yes, you could.

3755
03:35:41,480 --> 03:35:41,960
What?

3756
03:35:41,960 --> 03:35:42,440
How?

3757
03:35:42,440 --> 03:35:43,320
Oh, look.

3758
03:35:43,320 --> 03:35:44,200
There's the sink.

3759
03:35:51,240 --> 03:35:52,920
But it's all frozen.

3760
03:35:52,920 --> 03:35:54,600
So we'll be able to slide on it.

3761
03:35:56,280 --> 03:35:57,480
What's that over there?

3762
03:36:00,360 --> 03:36:01,320
It's forgotten.

3763
03:36:23,800 --> 03:36:24,760
Sorry.

3764
03:36:25,800 --> 03:36:26,120
Let go.

3765
03:36:26,120 --> 03:36:27,440
Oh, no.

3766
03:36:27,440 --> 03:36:28,440
Oh, hold on.

3767
03:36:28,440 --> 03:36:30,440
Hello, you, too.

3768
03:36:32,440 --> 03:36:34,440
You're not hibernating, either?

3769
03:36:34,440 --> 03:36:38,440
Oh, no. I haven't got time to spend four months sleeping.

3770
03:36:38,440 --> 03:36:42,440
Why not? Little May and I just woke up and now we don't know what to do.

3771
03:36:42,440 --> 03:36:44,440
I'm sure you can think of something.

3772
03:36:44,440 --> 03:36:45,440
Who's supposed to?

3773
03:36:45,440 --> 03:36:48,440
I've never seen the sea frozen before.

3774
03:36:48,440 --> 03:36:50,440
Did you make that horse too ticky?

3775
03:36:50,440 --> 03:36:52,440
Yes, I did. Can I sit on it?

3776
03:36:52,440 --> 03:36:55,440
No, you can't. I need it for the lady of the cold.

3777
03:36:55,440 --> 03:36:57,440
Oh, I see.

3778
03:36:57,440 --> 03:36:59,440
I suppose you've heard of her.

3779
03:36:59,440 --> 03:37:03,440
Yes, she's very beautiful, but if she looks into your eyes, you're turned into a block of ice.

3780
03:37:03,440 --> 03:37:05,440
She's not a very nice lady.

3781
03:37:05,440 --> 03:37:09,440
That's right, Little May and Spring can never come while she's here. It waits for her to go.

3782
03:37:09,440 --> 03:37:13,440
Oh, I see. And are you hoping she'll ride away on this horse, then?

3783
03:37:15,440 --> 03:37:17,440
Yes, and it will take her back to the north,

3784
03:37:17,440 --> 03:37:21,440
where she stays until she comes here again next winter and drives the sun away.

3785
03:37:21,440 --> 03:37:25,440
The horse doesn't look very solid to me, too, Tiki.

3786
03:37:25,440 --> 03:37:31,440
That's why I'm going to pour water over it when it gets really cold, and then it'll freeze solid.

3787
03:37:31,440 --> 03:37:33,440
When is the lady of the cold coming?

3788
03:37:33,440 --> 03:37:39,440
You can never tell, but soon, tonight, perhaps, it feels much colder already.

3789
03:37:39,440 --> 03:37:41,440
What's happened to the sun, Tiki?

3790
03:37:41,440 --> 03:37:43,440
Do you know when the sun will come back again?

3791
03:37:43,440 --> 03:37:45,440
Uh-당히.

3792
03:37:45,440 --> 03:37:51,440
It's in the south, shining on snuffkin, but it'll be back soon, and then it will stay a bit longer each day.

3793
03:37:51,440 --> 03:37:53,440
Good, I can't wait.

3794
03:37:53,440 --> 03:37:55,440
Now, I'll wait for it.

3795
03:37:55,440 --> 03:37:57,440
If you don't come back, it's a good thing to do.

3796
03:37:57,440 --> 03:37:59,440
What's happened to the sun, Tiki?

3797
03:37:59,440 --> 03:38:01,440
Do you know when the sun will come back again?

3798
03:38:01,440 --> 03:38:03,440
It's in the south, shining on snuffkin.

3799
03:38:03,440 --> 03:38:07,440
But it'll be back soon, and then it will stay a bit longer each day.

3800
03:38:07,440 --> 03:38:13,240
Good I can't wait. Now there'll be a full moon tonight and we'll be able to see everything.

3801
03:38:13,240 --> 03:38:16,640
Great! I can get my tray out. I can't wait to try it on the sea.

3802
03:38:16,640 --> 03:38:18,440
What do you mean, your tray?

3803
03:38:18,440 --> 03:38:23,940
Well, let's move in, Mama's tray, but I'm using it. I'm going to put a sail on it and slide across the ice.

3804
03:38:23,940 --> 03:38:25,440
Why not wait till tomorrow?

3805
03:38:25,440 --> 03:38:29,440
Wait until tomorrow? No. When I want to do something, I do it now.

3806
03:38:29,440 --> 03:38:32,440
What if the ice suddenly melts or something?

3807
03:38:33,440 --> 03:38:34,440
It...

3808
03:38:35,440 --> 03:38:36,440
Yeah!

3809
03:38:37,440 --> 03:38:42,440
I like it here. It's warm and cozy. I hope Moomin Papa doesn't mind me using it.

3810
03:38:42,440 --> 03:38:48,440
This is Papa's bathhouse. He built it himself and he'd be very glad to know you're using it.

3811
03:38:48,440 --> 03:38:51,440
It's great. The windowpains are different colors.

3812
03:38:51,440 --> 03:38:56,440
If you look out through one, the world is red and through another one, the world is green.

3813
03:39:08,440 --> 03:39:15,440
Oh, you don't hibernate either, do you? Now Scram! The horrible lady of the cold is coming and if she looks you in the eye, you'll turn to ice!

3814
03:39:15,440 --> 03:39:17,440
Go on! Go away!

3815
03:39:18,440 --> 03:39:19,440
Moomin!

3816
03:39:35,440 --> 03:39:37,440
Moomin! Toothiggy!

3817
03:39:38,440 --> 03:39:39,440
Moomin!

3818
03:39:41,440 --> 03:39:44,440
Moomin! Toothiggy, why you?

3819
03:39:44,440 --> 03:39:46,440
Little Mike, we're over here, huh?

3820
03:39:48,440 --> 03:39:50,440
Why are you doing down there?

3821
03:39:50,440 --> 03:39:53,440
Don't take his trying to catch some fish!

3822
03:39:53,440 --> 03:39:56,440
If she does, she's gonna cook us some dinner!

3823
03:39:56,440 --> 03:39:59,440
Right! I've got to get sailing, man!

3824
03:39:59,440 --> 03:40:02,440
I'd better go see what she's doing to Mom and Silver Trey.

3825
03:40:02,440 --> 03:40:03,440
Okay.

3826
03:40:06,440 --> 03:40:08,440
Ah, got one.

3827
03:40:14,440 --> 03:40:16,440
Oh dear, me.

3828
03:40:18,440 --> 03:40:21,440
Mmm, it's cold and wet under that ice.

3829
03:40:21,440 --> 03:40:23,440
How are you doing, little Mike?

3830
03:40:23,440 --> 03:40:25,440
Very well, thank you.

3831
03:40:26,440 --> 03:40:29,440
How can you get under the ice anyway?

3832
03:40:29,440 --> 03:40:32,440
I guess the water must be low and there's a gap left there.

3833
03:40:32,440 --> 03:40:33,440
Oh, how?

3834
03:40:33,440 --> 03:40:38,440
I don't know, but perhaps the tide was in when the sea froze and some of it got stuck to the shore.

3835
03:40:38,440 --> 03:40:41,440
Oh, I suppose it's possible.

3836
03:40:41,440 --> 03:40:46,440
Doothiggy told me that she has fish soup every day in the wintertime.

3837
03:40:48,440 --> 03:40:52,440
I know. I'll go see if the horse is frozen yet.

3838
03:40:52,440 --> 03:40:54,440
Make sure you shut the door behind you.

3839
03:40:54,440 --> 03:40:56,440
Oh, my thumb!

3840
03:41:05,440 --> 03:41:08,440
Mmm, I don't think it's hard enough yet.

3841
03:41:08,440 --> 03:41:11,440
I'll collapse if the lady if the cold gets on it now.

3842
03:41:15,440 --> 03:41:18,440
Oh, it's getting colder and colder!

3843
03:41:39,440 --> 03:41:41,440
The Grooke.

3844
03:41:44,440 --> 03:41:47,440
Don't tell me you want to ride the horse.

3845
03:41:49,440 --> 03:41:52,440
I don't think you'd better.

3846
03:41:52,440 --> 03:41:55,440
This is for the lady of the cold, you know.

3847
03:41:57,440 --> 03:41:59,440
There's no telling what she'd do to you.

3848
03:41:59,440 --> 03:42:02,440
Look you in the eye, probably.

3849
03:42:09,440 --> 03:42:11,440
Even the Grooke is frightened of the lady of the cold.

3850
03:42:19,440 --> 03:42:22,440
Ah, now it looks frozen.

3851
03:42:25,440 --> 03:42:27,440
Wee!

3852
03:42:31,440 --> 03:42:33,440
Wee!

3853
03:42:34,440 --> 03:42:35,440
Ha!

3854
03:42:37,440 --> 03:42:39,440
Great, isn't it, movement?

3855
03:42:39,440 --> 03:42:41,440
Yeah, that old tree really moves.

3856
03:42:41,440 --> 03:42:42,440
Want to go?

3857
03:42:42,440 --> 03:42:44,440
No thanks, I'm too big.

3858
03:42:44,440 --> 03:42:48,440
Come on now, the fish soup is ready and it's time you were inside, little my.

3859
03:42:48,440 --> 03:42:50,440
Keep it warm for me, I'm having another go.

3860
03:42:50,440 --> 03:42:51,440
No, little my.

3861
03:42:52,440 --> 03:42:53,440
Why not?

3862
03:42:53,440 --> 03:42:57,440
Have you forgotten what I told you the lady of the cold may be coming?

3863
03:42:57,440 --> 03:42:58,440
Oh.

3864
03:42:58,440 --> 03:43:00,440
Well, I want to see her, I'm not scared of her.

3865
03:43:00,440 --> 03:43:02,440
I'll be moving so fast she won't get a chance.

3866
03:43:02,440 --> 03:43:05,440
No, now listen to me, little my.

3867
03:43:05,440 --> 03:43:08,440
All you have to do is not let her look you in the eye.

3868
03:43:08,440 --> 03:43:12,440
But what happens if you're not quick enough and she catches you before you turn away?

3869
03:43:12,440 --> 03:43:16,440
I know, if we watch her from the bathhouse, she won't see us.

3870
03:43:20,440 --> 03:43:21,440
Please, little my.

3871
03:43:21,440 --> 03:43:23,440
Come in, she's almost here.

3872
03:43:23,440 --> 03:43:25,440
We can watch her from inside.

3873
03:43:25,440 --> 03:43:32,440
That's no good, I want to see her properly.

3874
03:43:32,440 --> 03:43:33,440
No, little my.

3875
03:43:33,440 --> 03:43:34,440
Don't go.

3876
03:43:39,440 --> 03:43:41,440
Come back, little my.

3877
03:43:44,440 --> 03:43:45,440
Oh dear.

3878
03:43:45,440 --> 03:43:48,440
Come on, let's get back in the cabin before it's too late.

3879
03:43:48,440 --> 03:43:50,440
Weeee.

3880
03:43:50,440 --> 03:43:53,440
No, no, no, no.

3881
03:43:56,440 --> 03:43:59,440
No, no, no, no.

3882
03:44:03,440 --> 03:44:05,440
Oh, the lady of the cold.

3883
03:44:06,440 --> 03:44:10,440
No, no, no.

3884
03:44:13,440 --> 03:44:18,440
No, no, no.

3885
03:44:20,440 --> 03:44:27,440
I saw her face, I saw her face.

3886
03:44:27,440 --> 03:44:31,440
I saw her and she didn't turn away to eye.

3887
03:44:31,440 --> 03:44:34,440
Trust little my to get away with it.

3888
03:44:34,440 --> 03:44:37,440
I don't know how she does it.

3889
03:44:37,440 --> 03:44:39,440
I think her nerves are made of steel.

3890
03:44:39,440 --> 03:44:41,440
I hope she's alright.

3891
03:44:41,440 --> 03:44:42,440
She's fine.

3892
03:44:42,440 --> 03:44:43,440
She's fine.

3893
03:44:43,440 --> 03:44:45,440
I don't know how she does it.

3894
03:44:45,440 --> 03:44:47,440
I think her nerves are made of steel.

3895
03:44:47,440 --> 03:44:49,440
I hope she's alright.

3896
03:44:49,440 --> 03:44:53,440
She should try not to make so much noise out there.

3897
03:44:53,440 --> 03:44:55,440
Oh dear.

3898
03:44:55,440 --> 03:44:59,440
You are home.

3899
03:44:59,440 --> 03:45:09,440
Oh dear.

3900
03:45:09,440 --> 03:45:17,440
Oh dear.

3901
03:45:17,440 --> 03:45:25,440
Oh dear.

3902
03:45:25,440 --> 03:45:32,440
Oh dear.

3903
03:45:32,440 --> 03:45:40,440
Oh dear.

3904
03:45:40,440 --> 03:45:43,440
Yeah, I know her face.

3905
03:45:43,440 --> 03:45:47,440
I know her face.

3906
03:45:47,440 --> 03:45:53,440
Oh.

3907
03:45:53,440 --> 03:46:00,440
Oh.

3908
03:46:00,440 --> 03:46:06,440
Oh dear.

3909
03:46:06,440 --> 03:46:10,440
Oh dear.

3910
03:46:10,440 --> 03:46:17,440
Little boy.

3911
03:46:17,440 --> 03:46:22,440
Oh.

3912
03:46:22,440 --> 03:46:29,440
Oh.

3913
03:46:29,440 --> 03:46:36,440
Oh.

3914
03:46:37,440 --> 03:46:43,440
Oh.

3915
03:46:43,440 --> 03:46:50,440
Oh.

3916
03:46:59,440 --> 03:47:05,440
Little boy.

3917
03:47:07,440 --> 03:47:09,440
Little my.

3918
03:47:09,440 --> 03:47:12,440
Come on, please.

3919
03:47:12,440 --> 03:47:18,440
Wake up, please.

3920
03:47:18,440 --> 03:47:21,440
Oh, please don't stay frozen, little my.

3921
03:47:21,440 --> 03:47:22,440
Don't worry, little my.

3922
03:47:22,440 --> 03:47:23,440
We'll thought you out.

3923
03:47:23,440 --> 03:47:24,440
Don't worry.

3924
03:47:24,440 --> 03:47:31,440
It's nice and warm here.

3925
03:47:37,440 --> 03:47:41,440
Ow, that's hot moment.

3926
03:47:41,440 --> 03:47:43,440
Praise the ball, Bob.

3927
03:47:43,440 --> 03:47:48,440
You come back.

3928
03:47:48,440 --> 03:47:52,440
So little my came back from the cold, little the worst for wear.

3929
03:47:52,440 --> 03:47:54,440
Movement need not have worried.

3930
03:47:54,440 --> 03:48:03,440
For the little my's in this world are practically indestructible.

3931
03:48:03,440 --> 03:48:10,440
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

3932
03:48:10,440 --> 03:48:18,440
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

3933
03:48:18,440 --> 03:48:22,440
They're always happy and always at play.

3934
03:48:22,440 --> 03:48:29,440
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

3935
03:48:29,440 --> 03:48:36,440
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

3936
03:48:36,440 --> 03:48:43,440
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

3937
03:48:43,440 --> 03:48:48,440
They're always happy and always at play.

3938
03:48:48,440 --> 03:48:55,440
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

3939
03:48:55,440 --> 03:49:02,440
The movements, the movements.

3940
03:49:02,440 --> 03:49:09,440
The movements.

3941
03:49:25,440 --> 03:49:30,440
Here they are for one and all.

3942
03:49:30,440 --> 03:49:33,440
The movements are about to come.

3943
03:49:33,440 --> 03:49:36,440
Come on and sit down here with me.

3944
03:49:36,440 --> 03:49:38,440
They're here for you on your TV.

3945
03:49:38,440 --> 03:49:41,440
They are the movements.

3946
03:49:41,440 --> 03:49:44,440
They are the movements.

3947
03:49:44,440 --> 03:49:47,440
So come with me, give me your hand.

3948
03:49:47,440 --> 03:49:50,440
I'll take you up to a movement land.

3949
03:49:50,440 --> 03:49:53,440
You can fly just like a bird.

3950
03:49:53,440 --> 03:49:56,440
Sing that song ever.

3951
03:49:56,440 --> 03:49:59,440
There were the movements.

3952
03:49:59,440 --> 03:50:02,440
There were the movements.

3953
03:50:02,440 --> 03:50:05,440
There were the movements.

3954
03:50:05,440 --> 03:50:08,440
There were the movements.

3955
03:50:08,440 --> 03:50:11,440
There were the movements.

3956
03:50:11,440 --> 03:50:14,440
There were the movements.

3957
03:50:14,440 --> 03:50:44,440
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

3958
03:50:44,440 --> 03:51:06,940
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba ...

3959
03:51:06,940 --> 03:51:11,260
little my woke up in the middle of it. I couldn't get back to sleep.

3960
03:51:11,260 --> 03:51:17,260
Ah, this is great. I'm really starving. I hope there's lots.

3961
03:51:17,260 --> 03:51:21,500
Oh, there's plenty left. Mama thought she'd made too much this year, but it's lucky for

3962
03:51:21,500 --> 03:51:24,900
us she did. I don't know what we'd have had to eat otherwise.

3963
03:51:24,900 --> 03:51:36,580
Shh, they're still sleeping. Well at least you got me to play with

3964
03:51:36,580 --> 03:51:38,580
Moomin.

3965
03:51:56,180 --> 03:52:01,220
That was fun. Why don't you have a go, Moomin? I'm probably a bit heavy for it.

3966
03:52:01,220 --> 03:52:05,900
So get something else, dummy. I might later. Anyway, I thought we were going to see

3967
03:52:05,900 --> 03:52:11,020
you too, Tiki. Come on, I'll pull you. Okay.

3968
03:52:14,220 --> 03:52:19,260
I know why you don't want to go, Moomin. You're scared of sliding down from the top, aren't you?

3969
03:52:19,260 --> 03:52:22,460
No, of course I'm not.

3970
03:52:29,340 --> 03:52:34,300
Tiki's not here. I wonder where she's gone too. That's her over there, isn't it?

3971
03:52:34,300 --> 03:52:38,220
Oh, yeah, I think it is.

3972
03:52:38,220 --> 03:52:41,500
Jane Moomin, she looks like she's sliding.

3973
03:52:41,500 --> 03:52:45,500
Sliding? Yes, it's obvious. She's sliding, of course.

3974
03:52:45,500 --> 03:52:48,700
She's coming over.

3975
03:52:49,980 --> 03:52:52,300
What were you doing out there, Tiki?

3976
03:52:52,300 --> 03:52:57,260
Watching the sun go down. It's the only place you can see it from. I just caught it for

3977
03:52:57,260 --> 03:53:02,140
it disappeared over the horizon. Where did it go to? It comes up again in the south and will

3978
03:53:02,140 --> 03:53:06,540
probably shine on snuffkin. Hey, Tiki, what are those things you got on your feet?

3979
03:53:07,340 --> 03:53:11,500
They're called skates, and they're the best thing possible for moving across the ice quickly.

3980
03:53:12,140 --> 03:53:15,820
Just what I need. Come on, show me how to do it. Yes, okay?

3981
03:53:19,020 --> 03:53:25,900
That's great. I'm going to make myself some skates, too. It's not as easy as you think, little lie.

3982
03:53:25,900 --> 03:53:30,460
Pathetic. All you need is a sword and knife on your shoes, and that sounds easy enough to me.

3983
03:53:32,300 --> 03:53:41,340
You know, it's strange, but I've got a funny kind of feeling that there's someone else, apart from us, in the bathhouse.

3984
03:53:41,340 --> 03:53:44,540
Hmm, well, there it is. Who is it? Where are they?

3985
03:53:46,540 --> 03:53:48,220
Little lie. You can't see them.

3986
03:53:48,860 --> 03:53:52,860
Ha, what do you mean I can't see them? Where are they hiding in the cupboard?

3987
03:53:52,860 --> 03:53:55,980
No, they're invisible. Look, I'll show you.

3988
03:54:02,780 --> 03:54:07,180
Oh, oh, there's something on my head! See, that's two of the shoe mice.

3989
03:54:07,180 --> 03:54:10,620
They're eight of them all together. Now, don't walk on the little lie.

3990
03:54:14,540 --> 03:54:19,580
I didn't see any shoe mice here in the summer, although if they're invisible, I wouldn't have done.

3991
03:54:20,220 --> 03:54:26,220
No, probably not, as in the summer when we come across new little animals that we've never seen before,

3992
03:54:26,220 --> 03:54:29,900
and who likes snuffkin, go away when the wind and snow comes.

3993
03:54:30,540 --> 03:54:36,700
Then, when the days are shorter and everyone else is hibernating, they come out, and some are so shy

3994
03:54:36,700 --> 03:54:40,380
they're invisible, dear. I'm afraid I don't understand winter at all.

3995
03:54:41,100 --> 03:54:45,660
Well, of course you don't. You moments have always slept through and don't know very much about it.

3996
03:54:46,700 --> 03:54:51,020
Oh, I can't wait to tell Mum or Papa about all this. They'll be really amazed.

3997
03:54:51,100 --> 03:54:52,860
Oh!

3998
03:54:56,860 --> 03:54:57,420
Moomin!

3999
03:54:58,380 --> 03:54:59,020
What is it?

4000
03:54:59,660 --> 03:55:01,660
We will wake up tomorrow, won't we, Moomin?

4001
03:55:02,220 --> 03:55:04,060
I'm sure we will. Why?

4002
03:55:04,060 --> 03:55:07,180
I just don't want to go on sleeping and sleeping until spring.

4003
03:55:07,500 --> 03:55:09,500
Well, we woke up today so…

4004
03:55:09,500 --> 03:55:11,500
But we don't know about tomorrow!

4005
03:55:11,500 --> 03:55:14,300
No, of course not. We'll have to wait and see.

4006
03:55:14,300 --> 03:55:17,580
If we're awake, we'll know, and if we're asleep, then it doesn't matter.

4007
03:55:17,580 --> 03:55:22,580
Well, if I'm not awake and you are, wake me up, okay, Moomin?

4008
03:55:22,580 --> 03:55:24,580
Yes, all right. Go to sleep now.

4009
03:55:24,580 --> 03:55:27,580
What if it's the other way around, Moomin?

4010
03:55:27,580 --> 03:55:30,580
Well, what if I wake up and you're still fast asleep?

4011
03:55:30,580 --> 03:55:35,580
I don't mind sleeping all winter. Now stop talking to me, my.

4012
03:55:35,580 --> 03:55:37,580
You'd better wake me up, or else.

4013
03:55:47,580 --> 03:55:57,580
Hey, little mind. Or have you gone to?

4014
03:55:58,580 --> 03:56:04,580
Hey, little mind. Or have you gone to?

4015
03:56:14,580 --> 03:56:16,580
Oh!

4016
03:56:16,580 --> 03:56:21,580
Hello! Well, well, wonderful place for skiing you've got here.

4017
03:56:21,580 --> 03:56:24,580
What are those funny things on your feet?

4018
03:56:25,580 --> 03:56:27,580
Hey, what? You're joking.

4019
03:56:27,580 --> 03:56:29,580
You mean you really don't know what these are?

4020
03:56:29,580 --> 03:56:31,580
That's why I'm asking you.

4021
03:56:31,580 --> 03:56:34,580
Well, they're skis, didn't you see me come down?

4022
03:56:34,580 --> 03:56:38,580
Yes, I did. Can you slide on the ice with these and go just as fast?

4023
03:56:38,580 --> 03:56:41,580
Oh no, on ice, you have to use skates.

4024
03:56:41,580 --> 03:56:43,580
What is that, young lady?

4025
03:56:43,580 --> 03:56:47,580
Oh, it's a snowboard. You slide on the snow with it.

4026
03:56:55,580 --> 03:57:00,580
Oh, that's not bad, but it's only a silver tray, isn't it?

4027
03:57:00,580 --> 03:57:01,580
That's right, mister.

4028
03:57:01,580 --> 03:57:02,580
I'll teach you to ski.

4029
03:57:02,580 --> 03:57:04,580
No, thank you. I'll learn by watching you.

4030
03:57:04,580 --> 03:57:05,580
Won't take me long at all.

4031
03:57:05,580 --> 03:57:08,580
I'm afraid skiing is not that easy, young lady.

4032
03:57:08,580 --> 03:57:10,580
Don't worry. It won't be for me.

4033
03:57:10,580 --> 03:57:13,580
Everything is once I decide to do it.

4034
03:57:14,580 --> 03:57:15,580
Epee!

4035
03:57:21,580 --> 03:57:24,580
Oh, so you spend all year going where the snow is?

4036
03:57:24,580 --> 03:57:25,580
That must be tiring.

4037
03:57:25,580 --> 03:57:28,580
Not at all. Life should be a struggle.

4038
03:57:28,580 --> 03:57:30,580
This jam is really good.

4039
03:57:30,580 --> 03:57:34,580
Does it always have to be winter, catch a struggle in spring and summer instead?

4040
03:57:34,580 --> 03:57:36,580
Well, no, that would be too easy.

4041
03:57:36,580 --> 03:57:38,580
You could just sit back and relax.

4042
03:57:38,580 --> 03:57:42,580
No, you've got to face up to the cold and exercise to keep warm.

4043
03:57:42,580 --> 03:57:45,580
Oh, that sounds very interesting, Mr. Brisk.

4044
03:57:45,580 --> 03:57:51,580
One clear cold bath a day keeps all those unnecessary thoughts away.

4045
03:57:51,580 --> 03:57:53,580
My own little poem.

4046
03:57:53,580 --> 03:57:56,580
What? You don't mean you swim in this weather, do you?

4047
03:57:56,580 --> 03:57:59,580
The water must be very close to freezing.

4048
03:57:59,580 --> 03:58:02,580
Well, the sea is a lot colder than that. It is frozen.

4049
03:58:02,580 --> 03:58:03,580
Is there a river?

4050
03:58:03,580 --> 03:58:07,580
Yes, there is, but the water looks very, very cold.

4051
03:58:07,580 --> 03:58:09,580
Sounds just right.

4052
03:58:10,580 --> 03:58:14,580
Have you got any more of this wonderful jam? It's delicious.

4053
03:58:14,580 --> 03:58:19,580
There's some more in the cellar, but we've got cranberry up here if you'd like that.

4054
03:58:19,580 --> 03:58:22,580
No, thanks. This will do for now.

4055
03:58:22,580 --> 03:58:26,580
I'd appreciate some after my daily swim. It'll work up an appetite.

4056
03:58:32,580 --> 03:58:34,580
Oh, this is great.

4057
03:58:35,580 --> 03:58:38,580
I can hardly watch. It makes me shiver all over.

4058
03:58:38,580 --> 03:58:41,580
Is everybody like you? Where you come from?

4059
03:58:41,580 --> 03:58:44,580
I'm personally not. Why did you join me?

4060
03:58:44,580 --> 03:58:46,580
No, thank you.

4061
03:58:48,580 --> 03:58:51,580
Hello? What are you two looking at?

4062
03:58:51,580 --> 03:58:52,580
Huh?

4063
03:58:53,580 --> 03:58:55,580
Oh, hello there, little dog.

4064
03:58:55,580 --> 03:58:58,580
We're watching that madman down there.

4065
03:58:59,580 --> 03:59:01,580
He looks like he's swimming.

4066
03:59:01,580 --> 03:59:04,580
Moon Valley is full of very odd people.

4067
03:59:04,580 --> 03:59:07,580
He's not from Moon Valley as a matter of fact.

4068
03:59:07,580 --> 03:59:09,580
Who are you?

4069
03:59:09,580 --> 03:59:12,580
I'm sorry, and I'm looking for my brothers.

4070
03:59:12,580 --> 03:59:15,580
I don't suppose you've seen them, have you?

4071
03:59:15,580 --> 03:59:18,580
Your brothers? Have you lost them?

4072
03:59:18,580 --> 03:59:21,580
Are they hibernating somewhere, do you think?

4073
03:59:21,580 --> 03:59:24,580
Oh, no, not them. They never do that.

4074
03:59:24,580 --> 03:59:27,580
Well, everyone else in Moon Valley is hibernating.

4075
03:59:27,580 --> 03:59:30,580
Except little Mai here, now too ticky, and the invisible mice.

4076
03:59:30,580 --> 03:59:33,580
Me? Oh, and that crazy person down in the middle.

4077
03:59:37,580 --> 03:59:39,580
Oh, yeah!

4078
03:59:44,580 --> 03:59:47,580
My brothers are up in the Lonely Mountains. Is that far from here?

4079
03:59:47,580 --> 03:59:49,580
No, not far.

4080
03:59:49,580 --> 03:59:53,580
Lonely Mountains. I know there are wolves up there, but I never heard of any dogs.

4081
03:59:54,580 --> 03:59:57,580
Well, wolves and dogs are brothers, didn't you know?

4082
04:00:01,580 --> 04:00:06,580
Oh, you know, this tastes even better after an invigorating swim.

4083
04:00:06,580 --> 04:00:09,580
That's my favorite jam, much nicer than cranberry.

4084
04:00:09,580 --> 04:00:11,580
Oh, I agree.

4085
04:00:13,580 --> 04:00:16,580
And doggie, now don't you want your jam?

4086
04:00:16,580 --> 04:00:18,580
What? No, you haven't.

4087
04:00:18,580 --> 04:00:20,580
Oh, thank you.

4088
04:00:20,580 --> 04:00:23,580
Oh, you look as though you're a bit worried about something.

4089
04:00:23,580 --> 04:00:25,580
Yes, I suppose I am.

4090
04:00:25,580 --> 04:00:27,580
Worried spat?

4091
04:00:27,580 --> 04:00:29,580
Put it out of your mind.

4092
04:00:29,580 --> 04:00:34,580
Why do you think your brothers are wolves? Did someone tell you they were?

4093
04:00:34,580 --> 04:00:37,580
Of course they are. Everyone knows that.

4094
04:00:37,580 --> 04:00:39,580
And besides, I can feel the wolf in me.

4095
04:00:39,580 --> 04:00:42,580
Well, you might feel it, but nobody can see it for a star.

4096
04:00:42,580 --> 04:00:44,580
Wolves are much bigger than you.

4097
04:00:44,580 --> 04:00:46,580
I want to go and find them, and then we can all hell at the moon.

4098
04:00:46,580 --> 04:00:48,580
I've been practicing.

4099
04:00:48,580 --> 04:00:51,580
I can see why he wants to be a wolf, but we'd better keep him here.

4100
04:00:51,580 --> 04:00:54,580
He could get her if he goes up there on his own.

4101
04:00:54,580 --> 04:00:57,580
You don't really want to live with wolves, do you?

4102
04:00:57,580 --> 04:00:59,580
Oh, I do very much.

4103
04:00:59,580 --> 04:01:01,580
Why don't you travel around with me, sorry, you?

4104
04:01:01,580 --> 04:01:05,580
I've got little dogs. They could be your brothers and sisters if you want.

4105
04:01:05,580 --> 04:01:06,580
Well, I don't know.

4106
04:01:06,580 --> 04:01:09,580
Look, I'm going to stay here and move in valley for a while,

4107
04:01:09,580 --> 04:01:11,580
and we can become great friends.

4108
04:01:11,580 --> 04:01:13,580
You're going to stay here?

4109
04:01:13,580 --> 04:01:16,580
Yes, marvelous slopes, fine swimming, the most wonderful jam,

4110
04:01:16,580 --> 04:01:18,580
and I'll build myself an igloo.

4111
04:01:18,580 --> 04:01:20,580
An igloo? You mean a house made of snow?

4112
04:01:20,580 --> 04:01:22,580
Yes, that's exactly.

4113
04:01:22,580 --> 04:01:26,580
If it's alright with you, I'll take this jam with me, just to keep me going.

4114
04:01:44,580 --> 04:01:48,580
Hello there. Can I borrow your spade for a minute, Mr. Brisk?

4115
04:01:48,580 --> 04:01:50,580
Of course. What for, my friend?

4116
04:01:50,580 --> 04:01:52,580
I want to break up this barrel.

4117
04:01:52,580 --> 04:01:55,580
Oh, that's easy. Allow me, little mind.

4118
04:01:55,580 --> 04:01:58,580
Here, here, here.

4119
04:01:58,580 --> 04:02:01,580
How's that young lady?

4120
04:02:05,580 --> 04:02:09,580
Mr. Brisk really loves this jam. He can't stop eating it.

4121
04:02:09,580 --> 04:02:13,580
Well, it's very nice, Moomin. I can't imagine anyone not liking it.

4122
04:02:13,580 --> 04:02:15,580
Do you know how to ski to a tiki?

4123
04:02:15,580 --> 04:02:18,580
Well, of course I do. I just haven't done it yet.

4124
04:02:18,580 --> 04:02:22,580
Mr. Brisk says that he's going to teach me.

4125
04:02:22,580 --> 04:02:23,580
Oh.

4126
04:02:25,580 --> 04:02:28,580
I can't move my legs tied up like this.

4127
04:02:28,580 --> 04:02:32,580
That's the whole point. You don't have to. You just move your skis. He's his winking.

4128
04:02:33,580 --> 04:02:35,580
No, no, no.

4129
04:02:38,580 --> 04:02:41,580
First of all, you have to learn how to fall properly.

4130
04:02:41,580 --> 04:02:45,580
Well, then if I learn to ski first, then I won't fall.

4131
04:02:51,580 --> 04:02:53,580
Little mind has skis, too.

4132
04:02:53,580 --> 04:02:57,580
Oh, they're just made from an old barrel. You're too much more sophisticated.

4133
04:02:57,580 --> 04:03:01,580
Now, an advantage in ease and lean forward. Are you ready?

4134
04:03:01,580 --> 04:03:06,580
I don't think I like this. It's too steep. Can I practice on something a bit flatter?

4135
04:03:06,580 --> 04:03:10,580
Well, maybe next time. Now then, I'll have a few rolls.

4136
04:03:22,580 --> 04:03:25,580
Trying to start an avalanche, Moomin?

4137
04:03:25,580 --> 04:03:28,580
You know, I think this hill is even steeper than the last one.

4138
04:03:28,580 --> 04:03:31,580
There's nothing to worry about. You've already mastered falling down.

4139
04:03:31,580 --> 04:03:32,580
Have you gone in?

4140
04:03:43,580 --> 04:03:44,580
Oh, stop it, please.

4141
04:03:44,580 --> 04:03:46,580
You can do it yourself. Just calm down.

4142
04:03:52,580 --> 04:03:55,580
Oh, look at that. Marvelous. You need it.

4143
04:03:56,580 --> 04:03:59,580
Please, someone stop me, please.

4144
04:04:03,580 --> 04:04:06,580
That was terrific, Moomin. Let's do it again.

4145
04:04:16,580 --> 04:04:18,580
What are you looking at, sorry, you?

4146
04:04:18,580 --> 04:04:20,580
I can hear all my brothers howling out there.

4147
04:04:20,580 --> 04:04:22,580
They're probably hungry and looking for food.

4148
04:04:22,580 --> 04:04:25,580
No, I know they're calling me.

4149
04:04:25,580 --> 04:04:29,580
I'm going to see them. I've really got to, Moomin.

4150
04:04:43,580 --> 04:04:45,580
Got anything? No, not yet.

4151
04:04:45,580 --> 04:04:49,580
I'm afraid there's going to be trouble. We're running out of jam.

4152
04:04:50,580 --> 04:04:52,580
Mr. Bresch, I suppose.

4153
04:04:52,580 --> 04:04:54,580
You can't stop eating it.

4154
04:04:54,580 --> 04:04:56,580
Well, you have to ask him to leave.

4155
04:04:56,580 --> 04:04:57,580
I can't do that.

4156
04:04:57,580 --> 04:05:01,580
Well, of course you can. It's your home and you can choose who you have.

4157
04:05:12,580 --> 04:05:15,580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

4158
04:05:15,580 --> 04:05:18,580
Usually, a sign that spring is not far away.

4159
04:05:20,580 --> 04:05:22,580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

4160
04:05:22,580 --> 04:05:25,580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

4161
04:05:25,580 --> 04:05:27,580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

4162
04:05:27,580 --> 04:05:29,580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

4163
04:05:29,580 --> 04:05:31,580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

4164
04:05:31,580 --> 04:05:33,580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

4165
04:05:33,580 --> 04:05:35,580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

4166
04:05:35,580 --> 04:05:37,580
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

4167
04:05:37,580 --> 04:05:40,580
A snowstorm.

4168
04:06:08,580 --> 04:06:10,580
Hello, Moomin.

4169
04:06:10,580 --> 04:06:13,580
Oh, hello, Mr. Bresch.

4170
04:06:13,580 --> 04:06:16,580
Look, I'm sorry, but all the jam's gone.

4171
04:06:16,580 --> 04:06:18,580
I'm just an empty jar.

4172
04:06:18,580 --> 04:06:20,580
Oh, well, never mind. It was a great jam.

4173
04:06:20,580 --> 04:06:23,580
But I have more important things on my mind.

4174
04:06:23,580 --> 04:06:27,580
You see, now that spring is here, I have to leave, Moomin Valley.

4175
04:06:27,580 --> 04:06:30,580
Oh, do you?

4176
04:06:30,580 --> 04:06:34,580
Hmm, it's sad, but there you are. I have to go.

4177
04:06:34,580 --> 04:06:36,580
Goodbye, Moomin.

4178
04:06:36,580 --> 04:06:38,580
Goodbye, then, Mr. Bresch.

4179
04:06:38,580 --> 04:06:40,580
Keep some jam for me.

4180
04:07:07,580 --> 04:07:09,580
Hello, I'm sorry. I'm your brother.

4181
04:07:09,580 --> 04:07:12,580
I've wanted to be with you for a long, long time.

4182
04:07:12,580 --> 04:07:15,580
I'm afraid I'm not very brave or strong, but if you'd let me stay with you.

4183
04:07:15,580 --> 04:07:18,580
Oh, don't you know me?

4184
04:07:18,580 --> 04:07:21,580
Looks like I was wrong.

4185
04:07:21,580 --> 04:07:23,580
Oh, well, go on.

4186
04:07:23,580 --> 04:07:26,580
Eat me if you want to.

4187
04:07:26,580 --> 04:07:31,580
It's a pity I didn't sleep at night instead of learning to howl.

4188
04:07:31,580 --> 04:07:35,580
Moomin was right. I shouldn't have come.

4189
04:08:27,580 --> 04:08:31,580
Oh, hello, little buggy. What are you doing here?

4190
04:08:31,580 --> 04:08:35,580
Have you been waiting for me?

4191
04:08:35,580 --> 04:08:39,580
We'll have a great time traveling around the world together.

4192
04:08:40,580 --> 04:08:54,580
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

4193
04:08:54,580 --> 04:09:07,580
Diverdi! Diverdi! Diverdi!

4194
04:09:24,580 --> 04:09:29,580
That was spring breaking through the ice.

4195
04:09:29,580 --> 04:09:32,580
Look at the theme moment, it's free again.

4196
04:09:32,580 --> 04:09:34,580
Will Little Mike get back?

4197
04:09:34,580 --> 04:09:35,580
Oh.

4198
04:09:35,580 --> 04:09:37,580
Oh my goodness.

4199
04:09:55,580 --> 04:09:58,580
Little Mike, hang on to me.

4200
04:09:58,580 --> 04:09:59,580
Thank you, Movement.

4201
04:09:59,580 --> 04:10:01,580
Let's go.

4202
04:10:01,580 --> 04:10:02,580
It's all right, Movement.

4203
04:10:02,580 --> 04:10:04,580
Don't panic, I'm with you.

4204
04:10:04,580 --> 04:10:05,580
You're okay.

4205
04:10:05,580 --> 04:10:06,580
Oh.

4206
04:10:06,580 --> 04:10:07,580
Oh.

4207
04:10:07,580 --> 04:10:08,580
Oh.

4208
04:10:08,580 --> 04:10:09,580
Oh.

4209
04:10:09,580 --> 04:10:10,580
Oh.

4210
04:10:10,580 --> 04:10:11,580
Oh.

4211
04:10:11,580 --> 04:10:12,580
Oh.

4212
04:10:12,580 --> 04:10:13,580
Oh.

4213
04:10:13,580 --> 04:10:14,580
Oh.

4214
04:10:14,580 --> 04:10:15,580
Oh.

4215
04:10:15,580 --> 04:10:16,580
Oh.

4216
04:10:16,580 --> 04:10:17,580
Oh.

4217
04:10:17,580 --> 04:10:18,580
Oh.

4218
04:10:18,580 --> 04:10:19,580
Oh.

4219
04:10:19,580 --> 04:10:20,580
Oh.

4220
04:10:20,580 --> 04:10:21,580
Oh.

4221
04:10:21,580 --> 04:10:22,580
Oh.

4222
04:10:22,580 --> 04:10:23,580
Oh.

4223
04:10:23,580 --> 04:10:24,580
Oh.

4224
04:10:24,580 --> 04:10:26,580
Over there, Movement.

4225
04:10:26,580 --> 04:10:27,580
Quick, do.

4226
04:10:27,580 --> 04:10:33,580
See, if you knew what I'd tell you, there's nothing to be afraid of.

4227
04:10:33,580 --> 04:10:34,580
Just trust me, Movement.

4228
04:10:34,580 --> 04:10:36,580
I'm always right, aren't I?

4229
04:10:36,580 --> 04:10:43,580
Yes, I know you are, Little Mike, but we'd still better hurry.

4230
04:10:43,580 --> 04:10:50,580
Come on, you two just a bit further.

4231
04:10:51,580 --> 04:10:52,580
Uh-oh.

4232
04:10:52,580 --> 04:10:53,580
No.

4233
04:10:53,580 --> 04:10:55,580
Wow.

4234
04:10:55,580 --> 04:10:58,580
Oh, it's cold in here.

4235
04:10:58,580 --> 04:11:00,580
Quickly, let's get inside and light a fire.

4236
04:11:00,580 --> 04:11:02,580
You'll soon warm up.

4237
04:11:05,580 --> 04:11:07,580
Shoot.

4238
04:11:12,580 --> 04:11:16,580
And so Mr. Brisk and the ice both left Woman Valley.

4239
04:11:16,580 --> 04:11:23,580
And spring returned once more after a long and eventful winter.

4240
04:11:23,580 --> 04:11:30,580
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

4241
04:11:30,580 --> 04:11:37,580
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

4242
04:11:37,580 --> 04:11:41,580
They're always happy and always at play.

4243
04:11:41,580 --> 04:11:48,580
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

4244
04:11:48,580 --> 04:11:52,580
The movements.

4245
04:11:52,580 --> 04:11:59,580
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

4246
04:11:59,580 --> 04:12:07,580
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

4247
04:12:07,580 --> 04:12:10,580
They're always happy and always at play.

4248
04:12:10,580 --> 04:12:17,580
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

4249
04:12:17,580 --> 04:12:21,580
The movements.

4250
04:12:21,580 --> 04:12:27,580
The movements.

4251
04:12:37,580 --> 04:12:49,580
Here they are for one and all.

4252
04:12:49,580 --> 04:12:52,580
The movements are about to come.

4253
04:12:52,580 --> 04:12:55,580
Come on and sit down here with me.

4254
04:12:55,580 --> 04:12:58,580
They're here for you on your TV.

4255
04:12:58,580 --> 04:13:01,580
They are the movements.

4256
04:13:01,580 --> 04:13:04,580
They are the movements.

4257
04:13:04,580 --> 04:13:07,580
They'll come with me, give me your hand.

4258
04:13:07,580 --> 04:13:10,580
I'll take you up to a moment land.

4259
04:13:10,580 --> 04:13:13,580
You can fly just like a bird.

4260
04:13:13,580 --> 04:13:15,580
Sing that song ever.

4261
04:13:15,580 --> 04:13:18,580
There were the movements.

4262
04:13:18,580 --> 04:13:21,580
There were the movements.

4263
04:13:21,580 --> 04:13:24,580
There were the movements.

4264
04:13:24,580 --> 04:13:27,580
There were the movements.

4265
04:13:27,580 --> 04:13:30,580
There were the movements.

4266
04:13:30,580 --> 04:13:33,580
There were the movements.

4267
04:13:33,580 --> 04:14:03,580
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

4268
04:14:03,580 --> 04:14:33,580
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

4269
04:14:33,580 --> 04:14:36,580
and enjoying the sunshine and the flowers.

4270
04:14:38,080 --> 04:14:40,580
Everyone that is except for Mumen

4271
04:14:40,580 --> 04:14:43,580
was in bed with a terrible cold.

4272
04:14:56,580 --> 04:14:59,580
Oh dear, Mumen, that's a nasty cough.

4273
04:14:59,580 --> 04:15:01,580
My throat is very sore.

4274
04:15:01,580 --> 04:15:03,580
Ah, this will help soothe it.

4275
04:15:03,580 --> 04:15:05,580
It's one of grandma's best potions.

4276
04:15:09,580 --> 04:15:10,580
It's hard.

4277
04:15:10,580 --> 04:15:13,580
Never mind. Nice tasting medicines don't always work as well.

4278
04:15:16,580 --> 04:15:18,580
I wanted to go out, it's spring.

4279
04:15:19,580 --> 04:15:22,580
I know dear, but you'd catch pneumonia or something.

4280
04:15:23,580 --> 04:15:24,580
Mama?

4281
04:15:25,580 --> 04:15:28,580
Does anyone know why snuffkin hasn't come back yet?

4282
04:15:29,580 --> 04:15:33,580
No, perhaps spring came earlier this year and he wasn't ready.

4283
04:15:37,580 --> 04:15:39,580
Snuffkin had always come back to Mumen Valley

4284
04:15:39,580 --> 04:15:41,580
on the very first day of spring.

4285
04:15:42,580 --> 04:15:43,580
But not this year.

4286
04:15:48,580 --> 04:15:49,580
Snuffkin.

4287
04:15:49,580 --> 04:15:50,580
Mumen.

4288
04:15:56,580 --> 04:15:59,580
I'm Mumen Papa, is Mumen any better?

4289
04:15:59,580 --> 04:16:02,580
No, I'm a Fred not, he's still got a nasty cough.

4290
04:16:02,580 --> 04:16:03,580
Can I go up and see him?

4291
04:16:03,580 --> 04:16:05,580
No, you'd better not, you might catch it.

4292
04:16:10,580 --> 04:16:11,580
Papa's right, Snuffkin.

4293
04:16:11,580 --> 04:16:13,580
You know how poorly you get when you're ill.

4294
04:16:13,580 --> 04:16:15,580
It's best not to take the risk.

4295
04:16:15,580 --> 04:16:17,580
I should think he'll be up and about before very long.

4296
04:16:17,580 --> 04:16:20,580
Yes, it's better to be safe than sorry.

4297
04:16:20,580 --> 04:16:23,580
Mumen shouldn't have gone out in the winter, should he, Mama?

4298
04:16:24,580 --> 04:16:26,580
No, but he couldn't go back to sleep.

4299
04:16:26,580 --> 04:16:29,580
Snow would have that effect on anyone.

4300
04:16:29,580 --> 04:16:33,580
Not you, little Mai was out in the cold with him and look at her.

4301
04:16:33,580 --> 04:16:35,580
She seems healthy enough.

4302
04:16:37,580 --> 04:16:39,580
I'll take these flowers to Mumen later.

4303
04:16:39,580 --> 04:16:42,580
Little Mai's too small to catch a cold.

4304
04:16:48,580 --> 04:16:50,580
This is boring.

4305
04:16:50,580 --> 04:16:52,580
I can't believe that Mumen's sick.

4306
04:16:52,580 --> 04:16:55,580
And Snuffkin's not back either.

4307
04:16:55,580 --> 04:16:57,580
I sure wonder what's happened to him.

4308
04:16:57,580 --> 04:17:01,580
I bet you Mumen gets better as soon as Snuffkin arrives in Mumen Valley.

4309
04:17:01,580 --> 04:17:04,580
He's never been this late coming back before.

4310
04:17:04,580 --> 04:17:07,580
Perhaps he's got better with you guys.

4311
04:17:07,580 --> 04:17:10,580
Impossible, he's very fond of me.

4312
04:17:10,580 --> 04:17:12,580
He's told me so lots of times.

4313
04:17:12,580 --> 04:17:14,580
He likes Mumen too, of course.

4314
04:17:14,580 --> 04:17:17,580
He might have been captured by a highwayman.

4315
04:17:18,580 --> 04:17:20,580
Let's go and look for him.

4316
04:17:20,580 --> 04:17:21,580
A highwayman?

4317
04:17:21,580 --> 04:17:23,580
First Snuffkin, Silly.

4318
04:17:23,580 --> 04:17:25,580
He's got to come back so Mumen will get better.

4319
04:17:25,580 --> 04:17:26,580
We must find him.

4320
04:17:26,580 --> 04:17:28,580
But where do we look, Snork Maiden?

4321
04:17:28,580 --> 04:17:29,580
In the south.

4322
04:17:29,580 --> 04:17:32,580
It's a big place. He could be anywhere.

4323
04:17:32,580 --> 04:17:35,580
Well, I don't care how big it is I'm going anywhere.

4324
04:17:35,580 --> 04:17:36,580
You're being silly.

4325
04:17:36,580 --> 04:17:37,580
No, I'm not.

4326
04:17:37,580 --> 04:17:39,580
I don't think your brother will like it.

4327
04:17:39,580 --> 04:17:41,580
In fact, I know he won't.

4328
04:17:41,580 --> 04:17:44,580
Have you gone completely bananas?

4329
04:17:44,580 --> 04:17:45,580
No, I haven't.

4330
04:17:45,580 --> 04:17:47,580
And you'll just have to make your own muffins.

4331
04:17:47,580 --> 04:17:49,580
There's more to food than muffins.

4332
04:17:49,580 --> 04:17:51,580
I was speaking figuratively.

4333
04:17:51,580 --> 04:17:53,580
Anyway, I'm going, dear brother.

4334
04:17:53,580 --> 04:17:56,580
And nothing you can do or say will stop me.

4335
04:17:56,580 --> 04:17:57,580
It's for Mumen.

4336
04:17:57,580 --> 04:17:59,580
That's a sort of hairbrain scheme

4337
04:17:59,580 --> 04:18:01,580
that could only have been dreamed up by you.

4338
04:18:01,580 --> 04:18:02,580
What good will it do?

4339
04:18:02,580 --> 04:18:04,580
You don't even know where he is.

4340
04:18:04,580 --> 04:18:07,580
It is not. Mumen is pining for Snuffkin.

4341
04:18:07,580 --> 04:18:08,580
Rubbish.

4342
04:18:08,580 --> 04:18:10,580
Men don't pine for their friends.

4343
04:18:10,580 --> 04:18:12,580
If he isn't back yet, then he isn't coming.

4344
04:18:12,580 --> 04:18:15,580
And if he isn't going to come, what's the point of looking for him?

4345
04:18:15,580 --> 04:18:17,580
You won't find him anyway.

4346
04:18:19,580 --> 04:18:22,580
He will come when he knows that Mumen is sick.

4347
04:18:22,580 --> 04:18:24,580
Black males just like a sister.

4348
04:18:24,580 --> 04:18:27,580
Something done for love could never be black male.

4349
04:18:27,580 --> 04:18:29,580
Oh no, you're not going and that's fine.

4350
04:18:29,580 --> 04:18:32,580
Look, why don't you and little Mai go by yourselves?

4351
04:18:32,580 --> 04:18:35,580
Well, I didn't really make a definite decision.

4352
04:18:35,580 --> 04:18:37,580
I just sort of said that I might come along,

4353
04:18:37,580 --> 04:18:39,580
but if Snort Maiden isn't going,

4354
04:18:39,580 --> 04:18:41,580
then there doesn't seem any point, does there?

4355
04:18:41,580 --> 04:18:44,580
And I'm not going because I think it's stupid and hairbrain, too.

4356
04:18:44,580 --> 04:18:46,580
Snuffkin will come back soon.

4357
04:18:46,580 --> 04:18:47,580
Not Snort Maiden.

4358
04:18:47,580 --> 04:18:49,580
What do you say to that?

4359
04:18:49,580 --> 04:18:52,580
How is Mumen feeling any better?

4360
04:18:52,580 --> 04:18:55,580
He's asleep now, but the cough doesn't seem so bad.

4361
04:18:55,580 --> 04:18:57,580
And is temperature still there?

4362
04:18:57,580 --> 04:18:58,580
Yes, it is.

4363
04:18:58,580 --> 04:18:59,580
And is temperature still there?

4364
04:18:59,580 --> 04:19:00,580
Yes, it is.

4365
04:19:00,580 --> 04:19:01,580
And is temperature still there?

4366
04:19:01,580 --> 04:19:02,580
Yes, it is.

4367
04:19:02,580 --> 04:19:03,580
Yes, it is.

4368
04:19:03,580 --> 04:19:04,580
It doesn't seem so bad.

4369
04:19:04,580 --> 04:19:07,580
And is temperature still quite high?

4370
04:19:34,580 --> 04:19:35,580
Snuffkin!

4371
04:19:39,580 --> 04:19:40,580
Snuffkin!

4372
04:19:51,580 --> 04:19:53,580
Am I pleased to see you, Mumen?

4373
04:19:53,580 --> 04:19:55,580
You look like you needed a lift.

4374
04:19:55,580 --> 04:19:58,580
This magic cloud must be one of those we got

4375
04:19:58,580 --> 04:20:00,580
from the Hobgoblins top hat.

4376
04:20:00,580 --> 04:20:01,580
That's right.

4377
04:20:01,580 --> 04:20:02,580
I had one of them away.

4378
04:20:02,580 --> 04:20:04,580
What a good idea, Mumen.

4379
04:20:04,580 --> 04:20:05,580
You are clever.

4380
04:20:05,580 --> 04:20:08,580
Well, it was so much fun the last time, wasn't it?

4381
04:20:08,580 --> 04:20:09,580
Hi, Mumen!

4382
04:20:09,580 --> 04:20:10,580
Hi!

4383
04:20:10,580 --> 04:20:12,580
Oh, look, Snuffkin.

4384
04:20:12,580 --> 04:20:14,580
I didn't know they were here, too.

4385
04:20:20,580 --> 04:20:21,580
Snuffkin!

4386
04:20:25,580 --> 04:20:26,580
Mumen!

4387
04:20:26,580 --> 04:20:28,580
Snuffkin!

4388
04:20:29,580 --> 04:20:33,580
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4389
04:20:37,580 --> 04:20:39,580
Not just a dream.

4390
04:20:39,580 --> 04:20:40,580
Snuffkin!

4391
04:20:47,580 --> 04:20:49,580
You look blousy, Mumen.

4392
04:20:49,580 --> 04:20:50,580
Oh, thanks, stinky.

4393
04:20:50,580 --> 04:20:52,580
You'd better keep away.

4394
04:20:52,580 --> 04:20:54,580
There's no need, bugs, and things like that.

4395
04:20:54,580 --> 04:20:55,580
Stay away from me.

4396
04:20:55,580 --> 04:20:57,580
They're probably frightened of someone so healthy.

4397
04:20:58,580 --> 04:21:00,580
Mama isn't letting anyone in here.

4398
04:21:00,580 --> 04:21:01,580
It's very dull.

4399
04:21:01,580 --> 04:21:02,580
You followed a bed or something?

4400
04:21:02,580 --> 04:21:03,580
Yes, I did.

4401
04:21:03,580 --> 04:21:04,580
I know.

4402
04:21:04,580 --> 04:21:06,580
You were dreaming, weren't you?

4403
04:21:06,580 --> 04:21:08,580
Unfortunately, yes.

4404
04:21:08,580 --> 04:21:10,580
I know how you feel.

4405
04:21:10,580 --> 04:21:12,580
I have that dream a lot.

4406
04:21:12,580 --> 04:21:15,580
Oh, you stand on a windowsill,

4407
04:21:15,580 --> 04:21:17,580
getting ready to break the glass,

4408
04:21:17,580 --> 04:21:19,580
and inside there's diamonds.

4409
04:21:19,580 --> 04:21:20,580
And then, moment, you fall.

4410
04:21:20,580 --> 04:21:23,580
It's not the same dream at all, stinky.

4411
04:21:23,580 --> 04:21:25,580
Snuffkin hasn't come back yet.

4412
04:21:25,580 --> 04:21:26,580
Have you heard anything from him?

4413
04:21:26,580 --> 04:21:27,580
He's very late.

4414
04:21:27,580 --> 04:21:28,580
Oh, Snuffkin.

4415
04:21:29,580 --> 04:21:30,580
Huh.

4416
04:21:30,580 --> 04:21:31,580
You know something, don't you?

4417
04:21:31,580 --> 04:21:33,580
All I know is that he went away

4418
04:21:33,580 --> 04:21:34,580
as usual last autumn.

4419
04:21:34,580 --> 04:21:35,580
It hasn't come back yet.

4420
04:21:35,580 --> 04:21:36,580
And then...

4421
04:21:36,580 --> 04:21:37,580
Yes, what?

4422
04:21:37,580 --> 04:21:39,580
Snork Maiden wanted to go looking for him

4423
04:21:39,580 --> 04:21:42,580
because she thinks that if Snuffkin comes back,

4424
04:21:42,580 --> 04:21:43,580
you won't be sick anymore.

4425
04:21:43,580 --> 04:21:45,580
But Snork wouldn't let her.

4426
04:21:45,580 --> 04:21:47,580
Snork Maiden?

4427
04:21:50,580 --> 04:21:52,580
Hey, Snork Maiden!

4428
04:21:52,580 --> 04:21:54,580
Snork Maiden!

4429
04:21:57,580 --> 04:21:59,580
You're not serious, are you?

4430
04:21:59,580 --> 04:22:01,580
I feel perfectly all right.

4431
04:22:01,580 --> 04:22:03,580
You look like that's warmed up, if you ask me.

4432
04:22:03,580 --> 04:22:05,580
Thanks a lot.

4433
04:22:05,580 --> 04:22:09,580
Now, stinky, tell me which way does Snuffkin normally travel south?

4434
04:22:09,580 --> 04:22:11,580
Hey, are you going looking for him?

4435
04:22:11,580 --> 04:22:14,580
Yes, it's not really spring in Moomin Valley

4436
04:22:14,580 --> 04:22:15,580
if he's not around.

4437
04:22:15,580 --> 04:22:17,580
It's just not right somehow.

4438
04:22:17,580 --> 04:22:20,580
Okay, you're all as mad as each other.

4439
04:22:20,580 --> 04:22:22,580
But you'll help me?

4440
04:22:22,580 --> 04:22:24,580
I've got to try and find him, stinky.

4441
04:22:24,580 --> 04:22:27,580
Yes, all right, but don't tell your parents I helped you.

4442
04:22:27,580 --> 04:22:29,580
Don't worry, I won't say a thing.

4443
04:22:49,580 --> 04:22:51,580
Sorry, stinky. Are you okay?

4444
04:22:51,580 --> 04:22:53,580
No, I'm fine.

4445
04:22:54,580 --> 04:22:56,580
Here's your lunch, Moomin.

4446
04:22:56,580 --> 04:22:58,580
How are you feeling?

4447
04:22:58,580 --> 04:23:00,580
Moomin?

4448
04:23:00,580 --> 04:23:03,580
Papa, come here quickly.

4449
04:23:06,580 --> 04:23:09,580
Oh, Papa, Moomin's gone. He's not in his bed.

4450
04:23:09,580 --> 04:23:12,580
Not in his bed? Are you sure, Mama?

4451
04:23:12,580 --> 04:23:17,580
Of course I am. His room is empty and there's no sign of him.

4452
04:23:17,580 --> 04:23:19,580
Perhaps he's in one of the other rooms.

4453
04:23:19,580 --> 04:23:21,580
Don't worry, Mama, I'll find him.

4454
04:23:24,580 --> 04:23:28,580
Yo, Moomin.

4455
04:23:28,580 --> 04:23:31,580
Moomin.

4456
04:23:31,580 --> 04:23:33,580
Hi, Moomin, Papa.

4457
04:23:33,580 --> 04:23:34,580
Oh, little Mai.

4458
04:23:34,580 --> 04:23:36,580
What's wrong? You look worried.

4459
04:23:36,580 --> 04:23:38,580
A moment's gone off somewhere.

4460
04:23:38,580 --> 04:23:41,580
I expect you must have gone to look for Snuffkin.

4461
04:23:41,580 --> 04:23:43,580
Snuffkin?

4462
04:23:43,580 --> 04:23:46,580
Well, you know how crazy Moomin is about him.

4463
04:23:46,580 --> 04:23:48,580
It's stupid if you ask me.

4464
04:23:48,580 --> 04:23:51,580
But he's not well, he's got a fever.

4465
04:24:17,580 --> 04:24:19,580
Are you sure this is the right way?

4466
04:24:19,580 --> 04:24:22,580
Of course I'm sure. I live in this forest, don't I?

4467
04:24:22,580 --> 04:24:24,580
Why don't we miss each other somewhere?

4468
04:24:24,580 --> 04:24:27,580
Well, if you think you might, don't go there and it's up to you.

4469
04:24:27,580 --> 04:24:31,580
But I've got to...

4470
04:24:31,580 --> 04:24:33,580
Moomin!

4471
04:24:33,580 --> 04:24:35,580
Oh, Snarkmaid.

4472
04:24:35,580 --> 04:24:37,580
Huh?

4473
04:24:37,580 --> 04:24:40,580
Where are you taking him, Stinky? You can see he's not well.

4474
04:24:40,580 --> 04:24:43,580
I'm not taking him. He insisted on going. I came to look after him.

4475
04:24:43,580 --> 04:24:45,580
Is that really right, Moomin?

4476
04:24:45,580 --> 04:24:49,580
Yes, I wanted to find Snuffkin, so he'd come back.

4477
04:24:49,580 --> 04:24:51,580
Well, I was going to find him for you.

4478
04:24:51,580 --> 04:24:54,580
Little Mai and Sniff were coming too, but they chickened out so I came on my own.

4479
04:24:54,580 --> 04:24:56,580
What did Snork say about that?

4480
04:24:56,580 --> 04:24:57,580
That he wasn't happy.

4481
04:24:57,580 --> 04:24:59,580
Oh, he made a big fuss and I just let him.

4482
04:24:59,580 --> 04:25:01,580
So you just walked out and came on your own?

4483
04:25:01,580 --> 04:25:03,580
Brothers, always think they can tell you what to do.

4484
04:25:03,580 --> 04:25:06,580
I just ignore him. Did you tell your parents where you were?

4485
04:25:06,580 --> 04:25:08,580
Ah, no.

4486
04:25:08,580 --> 04:25:11,580
Did you put him up to this Stinky? It's just a sort of thing you do.

4487
04:25:11,580 --> 04:25:12,580
No, I did not.

4488
04:25:12,580 --> 04:25:14,580
That's true, Snork Maiden.

4489
04:25:14,580 --> 04:25:19,580
Well, I don't know how you did it, Stinky, but I know you and I know you're to blame

4490
04:25:19,580 --> 04:25:21,580
and I don't think I won't find out.

4491
04:25:21,580 --> 04:25:24,580
That's not fair, Snork Maiden. It was nothing to do with me at all.

4492
04:25:24,580 --> 04:25:26,580
Oh, he's right, Snork Maiden.

4493
04:25:26,580 --> 04:25:28,580
He didn't want to show me the way, but I made him.

4494
04:25:30,580 --> 04:25:32,580
I'm taking you home.

4495
04:25:32,580 --> 04:25:34,580
Oh, but Snork Maiden.

4496
04:25:34,580 --> 04:25:38,580
No, buts. You're sick and you should be in bed and your parents must be very worried.

4497
04:25:38,580 --> 04:25:40,580
Look!

4498
04:25:41,580 --> 04:25:42,580
Moomin!

4499
04:25:42,580 --> 04:25:45,580
Oh, it's Papa. Isn't that Snork behind him?

4500
04:25:45,580 --> 04:25:47,580
I guess it is.

4501
04:25:47,580 --> 04:25:49,580
Uh-oh, it's time I wasn't here.

4502
04:25:49,580 --> 04:25:53,580
I'm glad you hadn't gone too far, Moomin. I might never have found you.

4503
04:25:53,580 --> 04:25:55,580
I'm very sorry, Papa.

4504
04:25:57,580 --> 04:26:01,580
I have a feeling you're behind this, Stinky. Come on, quickly, out with it.

4505
04:26:01,580 --> 04:26:05,580
Why doesn't anyone believe me? It was Moomin's idea. I swear it was.

4506
04:26:05,580 --> 04:26:08,580
It was, Papa. I wanted to find Snorkkin.

4507
04:26:09,580 --> 04:26:11,580
Are you all right, Moomin?

4508
04:26:11,580 --> 04:26:13,580
Snork Maiden!

4509
04:26:14,580 --> 04:26:17,580
Uh, here we go again.

4510
04:26:17,580 --> 04:26:21,580
Snork Maiden, what are you doing here? I thought I told you not to go on this silly jump.

4511
04:26:21,580 --> 04:26:23,580
Well, I didn't say I wouldn't. Did I?

4512
04:26:23,580 --> 04:26:25,580
Listen to me, Snork.

4513
04:26:25,580 --> 04:26:30,580
You're looking guilty, Stinky. How did you persuade her to disobey me?

4514
04:26:30,580 --> 04:26:32,580
See, I told you.

4515
04:26:33,580 --> 04:26:41,580
You stay nice and warm in bed and I'll mix some of grandma's potion with honey for you.

4516
04:26:41,580 --> 04:26:46,580
You'll have to be better soon because I have a feeling Snuffkin's on his way.

4517
04:26:52,580 --> 04:26:56,580
My wish Snuffkin would hurry up, then we could all get back to normal at last.

4518
04:26:56,580 --> 04:26:59,580
My sentiment's exactly.

4519
04:27:00,580 --> 04:27:02,580
So where is Snuffkin?

4520
04:27:02,580 --> 04:27:05,580
Well, he's on his way back to Moomin Valley.

4521
04:27:05,580 --> 04:27:10,580
But he's had a very long walk and is getting very tired now.

4522
04:27:21,580 --> 04:27:25,580
Poor Snuffkin. He's had a terrible cold as well.

4523
04:27:25,580 --> 04:27:28,580
Disfeeling rather weak.

4524
04:27:30,580 --> 04:27:32,580
Snuffkin.

4525
04:27:49,580 --> 04:27:52,580
Hello, I know you don't I?

4526
04:27:52,580 --> 04:27:53,580
Oh?

4527
04:27:53,580 --> 04:27:56,580
Yes, you're Snuffkin.

4528
04:28:00,580 --> 04:28:01,580
Oh!

4529
04:28:09,580 --> 04:28:12,580
Isn't that water still a little cold for that?

4530
04:28:20,580 --> 04:28:24,580
You'd better come by the fire and keep warm or you'll catch cold.

4531
04:28:30,580 --> 04:28:32,580
This is nice.

4532
04:28:38,580 --> 04:28:41,580
Just think, I'll be the one that's set by Snuffkin's fire.

4533
04:28:41,580 --> 04:28:44,580
And he told me to keep warm and not catch cold.

4534
04:28:44,580 --> 04:28:48,580
Hmm, that's no big thing, little fella. It's a pretty chilly night out here.

4535
04:28:48,580 --> 04:28:52,580
Oh, it is. I've heard so many stories about you from everybody.

4536
04:28:52,580 --> 04:28:57,580
And each year I try to watch you should go past, but I've never been brave enough to talk to you before.

4537
04:28:57,580 --> 04:29:00,580
Stories from everybody, I don't know if I like that.

4538
04:29:00,580 --> 04:29:02,580
In fact, I'm sure I don't.

4539
04:29:02,580 --> 04:29:04,580
What's your name, little fella?

4540
04:29:05,580 --> 04:29:07,580
Oh, well, I haven't got one.

4541
04:29:07,580 --> 04:29:09,580
I'm so small that nobody's ever asked me before.

4542
04:29:09,580 --> 04:29:12,580
I've always wanted to have a name, you know?

4543
04:29:12,580 --> 04:29:14,580
And it was you who asked me.

4544
04:29:14,580 --> 04:29:17,580
And I've actually met you and sat next to you at your camp fire.

4545
04:29:17,580 --> 04:29:21,580
Oh, it's so wonderful. You don't know how happy it makes me meeting you like this.

4546
04:29:21,580 --> 04:29:25,580
Oh, come on. You do go on a bit, old fella. You just get warm now.

4547
04:29:25,580 --> 04:29:29,580
Do you think, Snuffkin? Oh, I don't know whether I should ask you or I don't want to offend you.

4548
04:29:29,580 --> 04:29:31,580
Oh, well, why not? Yes, I will.

4549
04:29:33,580 --> 04:29:38,580
Perhaps you'd be kind enough to. I mean, would it be too much trouble for you to think of a name for me?

4550
04:29:40,580 --> 04:29:42,580
There. I've said it now.

4551
04:29:44,580 --> 04:29:48,580
Well, choosing a name is important. I'd have to think carefully about that.

4552
04:29:48,580 --> 04:29:51,580
But it will be easy for you. You know everything.

4553
04:29:51,580 --> 04:29:56,580
Now listen to me. You can't look up to people too much if you want to be yourself. It's not right.

4554
04:29:56,580 --> 04:30:01,580
But Snuffkin, you're so clever. You can do anything, anything at all. I know you can.

4555
04:30:01,580 --> 04:30:06,580
I've always wanted to be free like you to do whatever I feel.

4556
04:30:06,580 --> 04:30:12,580
Oh, I'm sorry I'm talking too much. I want to listen to you too. All about your travels for a start.

4557
04:30:12,580 --> 04:30:15,580
I know you're on your way to the Moon Valley to see all your friends.

4558
04:30:16,580 --> 04:30:21,580
The hedgehog told me the Moon stayed out for most of the winter. Just waiting for you to come back.

4559
04:30:21,580 --> 04:30:23,580
Now isn't that wonderful? What?

4560
04:30:23,580 --> 04:30:27,580
I'd love to have someone that missed me so much they were miserable until I came back.

4561
04:30:27,580 --> 04:30:30,580
You don't know how lucky you are that you're so special.

4562
04:30:30,580 --> 04:30:35,580
Well, perhaps I'm not going there. I might have somewhere else to visit instead.

4563
04:30:38,580 --> 04:30:42,580
Oh, Moon will be very sad if you don't go back.

4564
04:30:42,580 --> 04:30:45,580
Yes, but you've got to have time to be on your own as well.

4565
04:30:45,580 --> 04:30:49,580
Of course you have and I've taken up too much of yours now.

4566
04:30:49,580 --> 04:30:51,580
Wait, I think I'll be off.

4567
04:30:51,580 --> 04:30:53,580
Okay, thanks.

4568
04:30:57,580 --> 04:30:59,580
Goodbye Snuffkin.

4569
04:30:59,580 --> 04:31:01,580
Good night, little fella.

4570
04:31:13,580 --> 04:31:16,580
Hey, wait a minute. What about your name?

4571
04:31:16,580 --> 04:31:18,580
You remembered.

4572
04:31:18,580 --> 04:31:22,580
Well, what do you think of TD Wu, my friend?

4573
04:31:22,580 --> 04:31:24,580
Yes, TD Wu.

4574
04:31:24,580 --> 04:31:28,580
It's nice and happy to start with and then a little sadness.

4575
04:31:28,580 --> 04:31:30,580
TD Wu.

4576
04:31:30,580 --> 04:31:33,580
That's right. TD Wu.

4577
04:31:33,580 --> 04:31:36,580
TD Wu.

4578
04:31:36,580 --> 04:31:39,580
TD Wu. TD Wu.

4579
04:31:39,580 --> 04:31:41,580
TD Wu.

4580
04:31:41,580 --> 04:31:43,580
TD Wu.

4581
04:31:43,580 --> 04:31:45,580
TD Wu.

4582
04:31:45,580 --> 04:31:49,580
That's right. It's a wonderful name.

4583
04:31:49,580 --> 04:31:51,580
TD Wu.

4584
04:31:51,580 --> 04:31:57,580
I'm glad you like it. It's the first time I've ever given anyone a name.

4585
04:31:57,580 --> 04:32:03,580
I think I'll be able to house and then I can put up a real name plate that says TD Wu.

4586
04:32:03,580 --> 04:32:07,580
Ah, good idea, TD Wu. About what I said before.

4587
04:32:07,580 --> 04:32:08,580
Huh?

4588
04:32:08,580 --> 04:32:14,580
You know, not going back to Moon Valley? Well, I am. I've missed Moon and all my friends.

4589
04:32:14,580 --> 04:32:18,580
Oh, I didn't take that seriously. You just got upset at something I said.

4590
04:32:18,580 --> 04:32:21,580
I'm afraid that happens a lot. I guess I talked too much.

4591
04:32:21,580 --> 04:32:23,580
Maybe you do.

4592
04:32:23,580 --> 04:32:28,580
I'll be going back to Moon Valley a bit behind schedule and this year Spring came along early too.

4593
04:32:28,580 --> 04:32:32,580
But I suppose it's better late than never, as I say.

4594
04:32:32,580 --> 04:32:37,580
Moment will be happy. Say hello to everyone from TD Wu.

4595
04:32:37,580 --> 04:32:40,580
I will. And I'll tell them how it came about.

4596
04:32:40,580 --> 04:32:45,580
That's where you keep your harmonica, isn't it, Snuffkin? It's really famous, you know?

4597
04:32:45,580 --> 04:32:47,580
I didn't realize that.

4598
04:32:47,580 --> 04:32:51,580
Do you know? I've never ever heard any music.

4599
04:32:54,580 --> 04:32:56,580
Really? What would you like me to play?

4600
04:32:56,580 --> 04:33:01,580
Anything. Oh, I know. What about Moon's favorite?

4601
04:33:01,580 --> 04:33:03,580
I don't know.

4602
04:33:32,580 --> 04:33:38,580
Hmm? That's Snuffkin!

4603
04:33:53,580 --> 04:33:55,580
Don't know.

4604
04:34:01,580 --> 04:34:03,580
Snuffkin!

4605
04:34:31,580 --> 04:34:38,580
Now at last Spring really has come to Moon Valley.

4606
04:35:02,580 --> 04:35:08,580
The Moon is. The Moon is.

4607
04:35:08,580 --> 04:35:15,580
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moon is.

4608
04:35:15,580 --> 04:35:22,580
Believing and sharing and caring and giving the Moon is.

4609
04:35:22,580 --> 04:35:26,580
They're always happy and goes at play.

4610
04:35:26,580 --> 04:35:33,580
The Moon's are having fun day after day. The Moon is.

4611
04:35:33,580 --> 04:35:43,580
The Moon is. The Moon is.

4612
04:35:57,580 --> 04:36:03,580
Here they are for one and all. The Moon's are about to call.

4613
04:36:03,580 --> 04:36:17,580
Come on and sit down here with me. They're here for you on your TV. They are the Moon's.

4614
04:36:17,580 --> 04:36:23,580
They are the Moon's. So come with me, give me your hand.

4615
04:36:23,580 --> 04:36:29,580
I'll take you up to Moon and land. You can fly just like a bird.

4616
04:36:29,580 --> 04:36:34,580
Sing that song ever. There were the Moon's.

4617
04:36:34,580 --> 04:36:37,580
There were the Moon's.

4618
04:36:37,580 --> 04:36:40,580
There were the Moon's.

4619
04:36:40,580 --> 04:36:43,580
There were the Moon's.

4620
04:36:43,580 --> 04:36:46,580
There were the Moon's.

4621
04:36:46,580 --> 04:36:49,580
There were the Moon's.

4622
04:36:53,580 --> 04:36:58,580
There were the Moon's.

4623
04:36:58,580 --> 04:37:03,580
There were the Moon's.

4624
04:37:03,580 --> 04:37:07,580
There were the Moon's.

4625
04:37:07,580 --> 04:37:12,580
There were the Moon's.

4626
04:37:12,580 --> 04:37:18,580
There were the Moon's.

4627
04:37:18,580 --> 04:37:22,580
There were the Moon's.

4628
04:37:23,580 --> 04:37:27,580
All is peaceful in Moon Valley.

4629
04:37:27,580 --> 04:37:30,580
Mama waters the flowers.

4630
04:37:30,580 --> 04:37:35,580
While Papa relaxes in the shade on the porch.

4631
04:37:35,580 --> 04:37:39,580
Look, Mama, Moon Papa is sleeping again.

4632
04:37:39,580 --> 04:37:41,580
He had a long nap yesterday.

4633
04:37:41,580 --> 04:37:43,580
I think it must be the weather.

4634
04:37:43,580 --> 04:37:45,580
Too hot and sunny for me.

4635
04:37:45,580 --> 04:37:48,580
I wonder if he's worried about anything.

4636
04:37:48,580 --> 04:37:51,580
You don't sleep if you're worried you do something about it.

4637
04:37:52,580 --> 04:37:56,580
But Moon and Papa does have something on his mind.

4638
04:37:56,580 --> 04:38:03,580
Although it doesn't keep him awake.

4639
04:38:03,580 --> 04:38:08,580
He's having a nice dream as well.

4640
04:38:22,580 --> 04:38:26,580
Oh, a lighthouse.

4641
04:38:26,580 --> 04:38:29,580
That's it.

4642
04:38:29,580 --> 04:38:31,580
That's it, a lighthouse.

4643
04:38:31,580 --> 04:38:33,580
What about a lighthouse, Papa?

4644
04:38:33,580 --> 04:38:35,580
We're going to visit one.

4645
04:38:35,580 --> 04:38:36,580
When?

4646
04:38:36,580 --> 04:38:37,580
Right now.

4647
04:38:37,580 --> 04:38:40,580
Well, as soon as I find one, anyway.

4648
04:38:40,580 --> 04:38:42,580
That should stop you being bored, Mama.

4649
04:38:42,580 --> 04:38:44,580
Oh, I'm not really dear, but it would be nice.

4650
04:38:44,580 --> 04:38:45,580
Yeah.

4651
04:38:45,580 --> 04:38:48,580
Oh, I'm really excited.

4652
04:38:49,580 --> 04:38:52,580
It turns into a lovely water.

4653
04:38:52,580 --> 04:38:56,580
Yeah, I'll write an exciting, epic novel of the sea.

4654
04:38:56,580 --> 04:38:58,580
I'm sure it will be a great success.

4655
04:38:58,580 --> 04:39:02,580
If he puts some action in it, misses out the romantic stuff.

4656
04:39:12,580 --> 04:39:15,580
Stop it!

4657
04:39:19,580 --> 04:39:21,580
Tell me.

4658
04:39:21,580 --> 04:39:24,580
Does Moonman Papa want all of you to go away to this lighthouse?

4659
04:39:24,580 --> 04:39:25,580
Oh, yes.

4660
04:39:25,580 --> 04:39:26,580
It'll be great fun.

4661
04:39:26,580 --> 04:39:28,580
Just think of all the ships we'll be able to see.

4662
04:39:28,580 --> 04:39:30,580
Yes, that will be good.

4663
04:39:30,580 --> 04:39:33,580
Papa says he wants to write an exciting story about the sea.

4664
04:39:33,580 --> 04:39:35,580
With ships and storms and stuff.

4665
04:39:35,580 --> 04:39:37,580
Probably pirates, too.

4666
04:39:37,580 --> 04:39:40,580
Oh, he's stuck writing his memoirs again, is he?

4667
04:39:40,580 --> 04:39:43,580
Well, I guess that might have something to do with it.

4668
04:39:43,580 --> 04:39:45,580
But I think he just wants another adventure.

4669
04:39:45,580 --> 04:39:46,580
He's bored.

4670
04:39:46,580 --> 04:39:48,580
Well, it sounds a bit odd to me, Moonman.

4671
04:39:48,580 --> 04:39:49,580
No, it's not.

4672
04:39:49,580 --> 04:39:55,580
We're going to live in a real lighthouse and save ships from the rocks and being wrecked terrible storms.

4673
04:39:55,580 --> 04:39:56,580
Oh, I see.

4674
04:39:56,580 --> 04:39:59,580
What do you think the lighthouse keeper might say about you moving in?

4675
04:39:59,580 --> 04:40:01,580
Oh, he won't mind at all.

4676
04:40:01,580 --> 04:40:04,580
It'll be company for it, and I'm sure he'd like someone to talk to.

4677
04:40:04,580 --> 04:40:07,580
Looking after lighthouse is a very lonely job.

4678
04:40:07,580 --> 04:40:12,580
Ah, but if you thought, Moonman, that might be exactly why he chooses to do it.

4679
04:40:13,580 --> 04:40:17,580
You mean that he might want to be on his own all the time?

4680
04:40:17,580 --> 04:40:19,580
Well, some people like it like that.

4681
04:40:19,580 --> 04:40:22,580
Sometimes I like being on my own.

4682
04:40:22,580 --> 04:40:24,580
Not for long, though.

4683
04:40:24,580 --> 04:40:26,580
It'll be a lot of fun.

4684
04:40:26,580 --> 04:40:29,580
Snuffkin, why don't you come with us?

4685
04:40:29,580 --> 04:40:31,580
What, to a lonely lighthouse?

4686
04:40:31,580 --> 04:40:33,580
Yes.

4687
04:40:34,580 --> 04:40:38,580
Oh, no, which one is it?

4688
04:40:38,580 --> 04:40:40,580
There, that's the one.

4689
04:40:41,580 --> 04:40:43,580
So small, you can hardly see it.

4690
04:40:43,580 --> 04:40:46,580
How long would it take us to get their Moonman, Papa?

4691
04:40:46,580 --> 04:40:49,580
A day or two, I should say, depending on the wind.

4692
04:40:49,580 --> 04:40:51,580
But it looks so tiny.

4693
04:40:51,580 --> 04:40:52,580
Oh, I don't know.

4694
04:40:52,580 --> 04:40:53,580
Well, I think so.

4695
04:40:53,580 --> 04:40:55,580
How do we know which one is which?

4696
04:40:55,580 --> 04:40:58,580
Oh, don't you worry about that.

4697
04:40:58,580 --> 04:41:04,580
I've got an old compass somewhere, and we've got the map, then at night we'll be able to see the light itself.

4698
04:41:04,580 --> 04:41:06,580
Anyway, an old sailor.

4699
04:41:06,580 --> 04:41:07,580
An old sailor?

4700
04:41:07,580 --> 04:41:09,580
Well, I'm not really that young.

4701
04:41:09,580 --> 04:41:10,580
And you're no sailor.

4702
04:41:10,580 --> 04:41:11,580
Is this mutiny?

4703
04:41:11,580 --> 04:41:12,580
Don't be stupid.

4704
04:41:15,580 --> 04:41:17,580
How long do you think you'll want to stay, Papa?

4705
04:41:17,580 --> 04:41:18,580
About a month.

4706
04:41:18,580 --> 04:41:21,580
Oh, we'll need to take lots and lots of food, then.

4707
04:41:22,580 --> 04:41:23,580
Well, bless me.

4708
04:41:23,580 --> 04:41:25,580
I think that'll be enough, Mama.

4709
04:41:25,580 --> 04:41:27,580
Surely there'll be somebody living there already.

4710
04:41:27,580 --> 04:41:28,580
Don't be stupid.

4711
04:41:28,580 --> 04:41:29,580
Of course there is.

4712
04:41:29,580 --> 04:41:31,580
A lighthouse must have a keeper.

4713
04:41:32,580 --> 04:41:36,580
Yes, a man dedicated to the sea, suffering loneliness and hardship,

4714
04:41:36,580 --> 04:41:39,580
saving countless lives with no regard for his own.

4715
04:41:45,580 --> 04:41:46,580
Huh?

4716
04:41:46,580 --> 04:41:47,580
Is that you, Sniff?

4717
04:41:47,580 --> 04:41:49,580
Yes, hi, Mr. Hamilton.

4718
04:41:49,580 --> 04:41:52,580
I thought you'd be busy packing for the trip to the lighthouse.

4719
04:41:52,580 --> 04:41:55,580
No, well, I'm not going with them this time.

4720
04:41:55,580 --> 04:41:57,580
I've decided to stay here.

4721
04:41:57,580 --> 04:42:00,580
Oh, dear me, really? Sniffkin said he was going.

4722
04:42:00,580 --> 04:42:02,580
Well, I have something very important to do.

4723
04:42:02,580 --> 04:42:03,580
Important?

4724
04:42:03,580 --> 04:42:05,580
Sniff is just a big whip, that's all.

4725
04:42:05,580 --> 04:42:07,580
Oh, shut up, little mind.

4726
04:42:07,580 --> 04:42:08,580
Ah, don't tell me to shut up.

4727
04:42:08,580 --> 04:42:10,580
I don't listen to whims.

4728
04:42:10,580 --> 04:42:13,580
Hmm, now, now children, no squabbling.

4729
04:42:13,580 --> 04:42:15,580
It wouldn't be fair to the others.

4730
04:42:15,580 --> 04:42:17,580
I'm not a very good swimmer.

4731
04:42:17,580 --> 04:42:19,580
You mean if you fell and then we're drowning,

4732
04:42:19,580 --> 04:42:20,580
we'd have to jump in and save you.

4733
04:42:20,580 --> 04:42:21,580
Don't fall in, then.

4734
04:42:21,580 --> 04:42:23,580
Anyway, you could hang on to an or something.

4735
04:42:23,580 --> 04:42:25,580
What if it got swept away?

4736
04:42:25,580 --> 04:42:28,580
We'll put a life jacket on you stupid, don't worry.

4737
04:42:28,580 --> 04:42:29,580
What about the sharks?

4738
04:42:29,580 --> 04:42:31,580
They might take a fancy to me.

4739
04:42:31,580 --> 04:42:32,580
Wait a minute.

4740
04:42:32,580 --> 04:42:34,580
I know I'm not as�ologist,

4741
04:42:34,580 --> 04:42:36,580
but I don't think there are any sharks around here.

4742
04:42:36,580 --> 04:42:38,580
I'm sure I would have heard if there were.

4743
04:42:44,580 --> 04:42:46,580
Well, it's a real fine day for sailing.

4744
04:42:46,580 --> 04:42:49,580
Where are mama and the others?

4745
04:42:49,580 --> 04:42:52,580
Don't worry, Mumma, there's no hurry.

4746
04:42:52,580 --> 04:42:55,580
Are you sure that isn't too heavy for you, Sniff?

4747
04:42:55,580 --> 04:42:57,580
No, not at all, mama.

4748
04:42:57,580 --> 04:42:59,580
It's a shame that you're not coming with us,

4749
04:42:59,580 --> 04:43:01,580
but if you've got something important to do,

4750
04:43:01,580 --> 04:43:03,580
it won't be the same without you, though.

4751
04:43:03,580 --> 04:43:05,580
We'll miss you, Sniff.

4752
04:43:05,580 --> 04:43:06,580
Thank you.

4753
04:43:06,580 --> 04:43:08,580
Oh, dear, I left a jar of strawberry jam

4754
04:43:08,580 --> 04:43:11,580
and a whole batch of pancakes on the kitchen table.

4755
04:43:11,580 --> 04:43:13,580
Do you think you could manage to eat them?

4756
04:43:13,580 --> 04:43:14,580
Leave it to me.

4757
04:43:14,580 --> 04:43:17,580
Hi, y'all be lucky if there's any food left in the lard or mama.

4758
04:43:17,580 --> 04:43:19,580
He's a my.
