1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,400
Clap Clap Clap Clap

7
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,100
Clap Clap, and then clap

8
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,300
Pap dap dap dap bap bap

9
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,920
Pap dap dap, tap dap bap bap bap

10
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,560
Have you ever heard of Moon & Valley...

11
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:50,440
In winter, deep white snow covers the whole valley, and everyone goes to sleep so that they

12
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,640
keep warm.

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:03,760
Look, there's a woman house.

14
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:11,480
There's a woman, our hero.

15
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:20,920
A woman, Papa, and a woman, Mama.

16
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:34,440
And this little bundle must be little my.

17
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,440
I think before our story starts, we better wake everyone up with some spring sunshine.

18
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:14,440
At last, it's spring.

19
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Wake up everyone, it's spring time.

20
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:38,440
Oh, little my, you're up.

21
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,440
It's hard to stay asleep with you yelling, I can't help it if I'm happy.

22
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,040
So yeah woke me, I was having a lovely dream about living in a watermelon, but it's beautiful

23
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
outside.

24
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Oh gee, isn't it, is it really moving?

25
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Yes, it's all fresh, the flowers are out and the sun is shining.

26
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
So, I like being asleep.

27
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
But it's spring.

28
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,040
You said you wanted me to wake you as soon as spring was here.

29
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
Oh boy, did I?

30
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
Yes, you did, little my.

31
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,040
You said you wanted to be a welcome as soon as spring was here.

32
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Really?

33
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Yes, you did.

34
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Did I say something like that?

35
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
I can go back to bed if you want to.

36
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,040
Nobody's making you get up, little my.

37
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,040
No, there's really no point, movement.

38
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
I'm not sleepy anymore.

39
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Well, there you are then.

40
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Mama!

41
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Good spring, movement.

42
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Movement, mama.

43
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
I'm starving.

44
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Have you got any watermelon?

45
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,040
No, but there's lots of other things.

46
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,040
We'll all have a nice big breakfast.

47
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,040
I can hear a snuff gun.

48
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Wouldn't it be quicker to use the stairs?

49
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,040
More fun this way.

50
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Are you going home now?

51
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Yes.

52
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Thanks very much for letting me spend the winter here.

53
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Don't think your sister will be back yet, though.

54
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,040
I'll go anyway.

55
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Snuff gun!

56
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Oh, hello, movement.

57
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,040
It's really good to see you, snuff gun.

58
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
And you too?

59
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
You're back, Arlie.

60
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Won't you have a good time?

61
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Yes, I was.

62
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,040
But I didn't want to miss springtime and movement valley.

63
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,040
What did you do?

64
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,040
I'll tell you later.

65
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Let's go wake up, Snuff, and think of something exciting to do.

66
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,040
I don't think I'll like it.

67
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
He's still snoring, movement.

68
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,040
I'll do it again.

69
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,040
Well, that's done it.

70
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,040
Come on, Snuff, it's spring.

71
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Snuff gun's here.

72
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Please go away, you two.

73
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,040
We're going to do something really exciting.

74
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Like what, moment?

75
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,040
I can think of more exciting things to do than this.

76
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Well, let's imagine that we're the first ever to climb this mountain.

77
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
It's such a clear day.

78
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,040
We'll be able to see all the movement valley when we get to the top and the sea.

79
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Good morning, Mr. Hemiolens.

80
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Morning, moment.

81
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Are your father and mother up?

82
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Yes.

83
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Mama was when I came out.

84
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Good.

85
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,040
I'll never understand how you can sleep for months on end.

86
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
We like it.

87
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Oh, yes.

88
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Why do they always have to do something exciting?

89
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
What a gorgeous view.

90
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,040
It really is.

91
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Hey, look, they're smoke coming from moment house.

92
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
We should have stayed at home.

93
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,040
My bet moment, Mama's cooking something good.

94
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Look.

95
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
What is it?

96
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,040
We're not the first here after all.

97
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Look over there.

98
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
A top hat.

99
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Hmm, a rather large one.

100
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
I wonder who's how it is.

101
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,040
I don't know, but I know papa would like it.

102
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Hmm, it's much too big.

103
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Look.

104
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Oh dear, what's that?

105
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,040
I can really get inside it.

106
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,040
You see, I cover for my old one.

107
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Oh, oh, oh.

108
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Oh, I can't woman it.

109
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Stuck, woman.

110
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,040
No, that's enough nonsense.

111
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,040
I think I'll take it off now.

112
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Oh, damn.

113
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
What's the matter?

114
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,040
I can't move it. It's stuck, woman.

115
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,040
I'll give you a hand.

116
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
It's harder.

117
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,040
Oh, oh.

118
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Oh, that's better.

119
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Thank you.

120
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
What's all this noise?

121
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Papa's head got stuck in the hat, Mama.

122
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Oh, yes, and where did that come from?

123
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
Oh, a moment, Mama.

124
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,040
The children found it when they were out and brought it back for me.

125
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,040
It's very smart.

126
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
What shall we do with it, Papa?

127
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
There is something strange about it.

128
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Shall I throw it away then?

129
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Oh, no. It's too good for that.

130
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Do we know anyone with a very big hand?

131
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,040
No, woman, Papa.

132
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,040
I know what we can do with it.

133
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,040
Oh, it's a...

134
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
A waste paper basket, Mama, Mama.

135
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
That's right. Well done, Snuffkin.

136
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
That was easy.

137
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Come on, Snuffkin.

138
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Come and have some breakfast with us.

139
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,040
Hmm, beautiful.

140
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Hmm, beautiful.

141
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
Yes.

142
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,040
Sorry to disturb you, but I'm going to see women.

143
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Uh-huh.

144
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Do you want to come with me, Snork?

145
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
Uh-huh.

146
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Or would you rather stay here?

147
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Uh-huh.

148
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Well, are you coming or not?

149
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Uh-huh.

150
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Not coming, man?

151
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
Uh-huh.

152
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,040
Snork?

153
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Well, you know my flying ship is almost finished.

154
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,040
It'll be ready this year. You'll see.

155
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,040
This isn't his target moment.

156
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,040
Whoa!

157
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Oh, dear.

158
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Perhaps it needs a little more work.

159
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,040
I wonder if you really can make a flying ship.

160
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Don't be silly, of course you can't.

161
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,040
A little, my Snorks always dreamed about doing it.

162
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Dreams are all right.

163
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Yes, as long as they're not impossible.

164
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
I suppose so.

165
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Hmm.

166
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,040
Sniff, you're not still feeding your face, are you?

167
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,040
Do you ever dream, Sniff?

168
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Only nightmares about having no food at all, little my.

169
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Hmm. I wonder who dropped this.

170
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Now where can I put it?

171
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,040
Oh.

172
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,040
There you are. Just a thing.

173
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,040
Oh.

174
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,040
Wow.

175
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,040
Golly, what are they?

176
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
They're clouds.

177
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,040
Be careful. Don't touch it. It might be poisonous.

178
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,040
It feels like cotton.

179
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Well, ee!

180
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,040
This is great. I'm floating. Wonderful.

181
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
Can I try?

182
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,040
Are you ready, Snork Maiden?

183
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
Here we go.

184
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
What if you go too high?

185
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,040
My phone.

186
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,040
Wait for me.

187
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,040
Hey, wait for me.

188
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,040
Whoa.

189
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,040
Hey, wait for me.

190
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,040
Hey, wait for me.

191
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Hey, wait for me.

192
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,040
Let me get on.

193
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Ow. Ow. I'm falling.

194
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Ow.

195
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Woman Papa is in his study trying to write his memoirs.

196
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,040
A lot has happened to him over the years.

197
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
An awful lot.

198
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,040
And he's trying to remember it.

199
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,040
What was that?

200
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Woman.

201
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
Hi, Papa.

202
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,040
What are you doing out there?

203
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
We're flying.

204
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,040
The clouds just came out of the house.

205
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,040
Try and get nearer so I can reach you.

206
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,040
No, I'm alright.

207
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Why don't you come for a ride?

208
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Stop. Wait a minute.

209
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,040
It's great. You feel like a bird.

210
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Woman.

211
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Come on, Papa. Jump or you'll fall.

212
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
It's alright.

213
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Oh.

214
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
What?

215
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
Oh.

216
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Woman, Mama, quickly.

217
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
What's the matter?

218
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
Have you seen what the children are doing?

219
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Yes.

220
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Look at them. They're flying about on clouds.

221
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
It can't be safe.

222
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,040
Don't worry, Papa. It's alright.

223
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,040
I told them to be careful.

224
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
Come on, Snapping.

225
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,040
To go out.

226
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
I won, I won.

227
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Whoa. Hey, wait a minute.

228
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Little cloud. Wait for me.

229
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Don't go away.

230
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Oh, I got you.

231
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
That is tree cotton.

232
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
I'm going to climb right up here.

233
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
And I'm going to get you right there.

234
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
This branch. Come on.

235
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Come on, little cloud.

236
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
I'm going to take you with me.

237
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Here, come on.

238
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
You just keep coming back here.

239
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Yeah.

240
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
I got you now.

241
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
You are going to get away from me.

242
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
Here I go.

243
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
Come on.

244
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
All of that ledge.

245
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
Come on.

246
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Stop.

247
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
I want you to play.

248
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
Oh.

249
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
Oh.

250
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
Oh, boy. What's happening?

251
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
My cloud's starting to go.

252
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Oh.

253
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Whoa. Whoa.

254
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
That was fun.

255
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,040
Yeah, it was.

256
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
But I wasn't ready to stop.

257
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
Look.

258
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
There's movement in Snork Maiden.

259
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Hey.

260
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Why have they still got cloud snuffed in?

261
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,040
There's a starting to go as well.

262
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
I think they'd better get off.

263
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Hey.

264
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Right.

265
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
I'll start counting.

266
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,040
One, two, three.

267
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,040
Do you want something little mind?

268
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Oh, yes.

269
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
A place to hide.

270
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,040
Boy, I don't think there's any place to hide.

271
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,040
And here is there.

272
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,040
No.

273
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,040
Oh, it's too dirty in there.

274
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
I'm going to have.

275
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
I know.

276
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,040
I'll hide in the head.

277
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,040
Oh.

278
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,040
One, two, one, two, one.

279
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Hey.

280
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
Hey.

281
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Huh?

282
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
Huh?

283
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Gotcha.

284
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Snork Maiden.

285
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,040
Snork Maiden.

286
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Hey.

287
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Baaah!

288
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
Baaah!

289
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,040
Movement must be around here somewhere.

290
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Well, last time I saw him, he was hiding in the fireplace.

291
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
Have you found him yet?

292
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
No.

293
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
Have you looked in the cellar?

294
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Yes, I have.

295
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Wait a minute.

296
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Did you hear someone laughing?

297
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
Where'd it come from?

298
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,040
Gee, I better go home.

299
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Oh, is there anything wrong?

300
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Yes.

301
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
I can't find moment anywhere.

302
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Well, he's too fat to be most places.

303
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
He's coming from under the hat.

304
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Well, here I am, sniff.

305
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Who on earth are you?

306
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

307
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,040
I won, and didn't I?

308
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
You looked everywhere in the house,

309
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
and you couldn't find me, couldn't you?

310
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
So I won.

311
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Who'd want to find you anyway?

312
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Well, you were trying hard enough, weren't you?

313
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
What is this, a new game?

314
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
My name's Snork Maiden.

315
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
What's yours?

316
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
I'm the king of Movement Valley.

317
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
My pretty one.

318
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,040
You're too ugly to be the king of anything.

319
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
Well, now.

320
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,040
That's not a very nice thing to say to your friend.

321
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Is it, Papa?

322
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Now, you'd better tell me what you have done with Movement.

323
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
But I'm here.

324
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Where?

325
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Right here.

326
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
Who are you?

327
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,040
And where is Movement?

328
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
Papa.

329
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
I'm certainly not your Papa.

330
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Yes, you are.

331
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Come on.

332
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
I'm Movement.

333
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,040
I don't know who you are.

334
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
I'm not Movement.

335
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,040
He's nice and handsome and nothing like you.

336
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Have you looked at yourself in a mirror?

337
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Ah!

338
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
But where's my nose gone?

339
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Oh, there's nothing there anymore.

340
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Ah!

341
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Ah!

342
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
Oh no!

343
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
My tail's all pushy!

344
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Ah!

345
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Oh!

346
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
This is terrible!

347
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Oh!

348
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Who are you?

349
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
What have you done with me?

350
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
It must be a nightmare!

351
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
I want to come back!

352
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Go away, you're horrible!

353
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Dear me, what's all this noise?

354
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
What's happened?

355
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Mama!

356
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,040
Mama!

357
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Mama!

358
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
What earth is this?

359
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,040
This is Movement, but just look at him.

360
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,040
You don't look like I'm Movement.

361
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
I am, I am.

362
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Please believe me, Mama.

363
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
I am Movement.

364
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
Well, I don't know.

365
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
I'm sure.

366
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Something's happened to me.

367
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Why do I look so different?

368
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Now then calm down.

369
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
This won't help at all.

370
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
We don't need all this noise.

371
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,040
If you really are Movement, then everything will be alright.

372
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Just give me a minute or two and I'll know.

373
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
Mama, call me Movement, please.

374
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
I don't know what's happened, but I am me.

375
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Honestly, I am.

376
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Mama, please believe me.

377
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
I am Movement.

378
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Let me see.

379
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Oh, Mama, you do know it's me.

380
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
You must.

381
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
You can forget your little movement.

382
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Please, Mama, please, Mama.

383
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,040
Oh, hush now, hush now.

384
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Mama!

385
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Yes, you're my little movement alright.

386
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Oh, Mama!

387
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Oh.

388
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Oh, Movement.

389
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Papa.

390
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Oh, Movement, my boy.

391
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Where were you hiding?

392
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
In there.

393
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,040
In the hat?

394
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Let's hope it's the last we'll see of it.

395
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,040
Movement, Papa, decided that although it was a fine hat,

396
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
it was too dangerous to keep.

397
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,040
So, Movement threw it in the river and it floated away.

398
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,040
He wasn't too sure about it though,

399
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,040
because it was a rather special hat.

400
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:13,040
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

401
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:21,040
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

402
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,040
They're always happy and always at play.

403
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,040
The movements are having fun day after day.

404
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,040
The movements.

405
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,040
The movements.

406
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:42,040
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

407
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

408
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,040
They're always happy and always at play.

409
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,040
The movements are having fun day after day.

410
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,040
The movements.

411
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,040
The movements.

412
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,040
The movements.

413
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,040
The movements.
