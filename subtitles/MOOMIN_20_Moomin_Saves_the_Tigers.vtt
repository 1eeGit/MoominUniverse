00:00.000 --> 00:20.560
here they are for one and all the moments are about to come on and sit down here with

00:20.560 --> 00:30.440
me they're for you on your TV they are the moments they are the moments so come

00:30.440 --> 00:37.240
with me give me your hand I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just

00:37.240 --> 00:44.640
like a bird sing that song ever there were the moments there were the

00:44.640 --> 00:57.840
moments there was the moments there were the moments there were the moments

01:14.640 --> 01:22.480
Vah, vva, vva, vva, vva …

01:22.480 --> 01:32.060
Vah, vva, vva, vva, vva …

01:32.060 --> 01:52.980
The rhino and the tigers that stinky set free from the zoo are now living in the jungle

01:52.980 --> 01:57.420
that has grown up around Moomin house and have settled into the restful life of Moomin

01:57.420 --> 01:58.420
Valley.

01:59.420 --> 02:02.420
Hey, have you seen Moomin?

02:02.420 --> 02:04.420
No, you haven't seen him all evening.

02:04.420 --> 02:05.420
Hmm.

02:05.420 --> 02:09.420
I wonder where they got to.

02:09.420 --> 02:14.700
Meanwhile, Moomin and Snork Maiden chased by the snake and are swimming as fast as they

02:14.700 --> 02:15.700
can out to sea.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.700
I can't swim another.

02:18.700 --> 02:21.700
Soon must not wait until you bust.

02:21.700 --> 02:22.700
Hey!

02:22.700 --> 02:26.700
Hey, you there!

02:26.700 --> 02:31.700
Come on, Snork Maiden!

02:31.700 --> 02:32.700
Nearly there!

02:32.700 --> 02:36.620
Look, there's a couple of hippos that come in towards us.

02:36.620 --> 02:37.860
We better get them on board.

02:37.860 --> 02:38.860
That's funny.

02:38.860 --> 02:42.540
I haven't heard about any hippos reported missing from the zoo lately.

02:42.540 --> 02:53.540
Just a bit further, Snork Maiden.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.540
We made it.

02:55.540 --> 02:58.540
I didn't know hippos could climb so well.

02:58.540 --> 03:01.700
Oh, thank you so much.

03:01.700 --> 03:03.780
There was a huge snake chasing us.

03:03.780 --> 03:06.580
Yes, we saw you were lucky we came along when we did.

03:06.580 --> 03:07.900
Thank you for your help.

03:07.900 --> 03:09.380
Who's ship is this?

03:09.380 --> 03:10.380
ours.

03:10.380 --> 03:11.380
We're from the zoo.

03:11.380 --> 03:12.380
The zoo?

03:12.380 --> 03:15.020
Oh, you've got one of the crocodiles.

03:15.020 --> 03:18.060
Yes, and a lot of trouble he gave us as well.

03:18.060 --> 03:19.860
There's another one around here somewhere.

03:19.860 --> 03:20.860
We saw them.

03:20.860 --> 03:24.060
Yes, we know there is, but we haven't been able to find him yet.

03:24.060 --> 03:25.060
Oh, boy.

03:25.060 --> 03:27.780
I wish they'd come as quietly as you hippos did.

03:27.780 --> 03:28.780
Hippos?

03:28.780 --> 03:29.780
Hippos?

03:29.780 --> 03:31.540
Which zoo are you from?

03:31.540 --> 03:33.780
I bet they'd pay well to get you back.

03:33.780 --> 03:34.780
Now look here.

03:34.780 --> 03:35.780
I'm a woman.

03:35.780 --> 03:36.780
Not a hippo.

03:36.780 --> 03:37.780
Are you saying that?

03:37.780 --> 03:38.780
I look like a hippo?

03:38.780 --> 03:41.420
Well, perhaps they don't look exactly like hippos.

03:41.420 --> 03:44.260
No, but they're close enough, Captain.

03:44.260 --> 03:47.060
I'm sure they've escaped from the zoo somewhere, though.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.060
Yes, sir.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.020
We haven't escaped from anywhere.

03:50.020 --> 03:51.340
Certainly not a zoo.

03:51.340 --> 03:52.340
We live in Moomin Valley.

03:52.340 --> 03:53.340
We're Moomin's.

03:53.460 --> 03:54.660
It's all right, Snort Maiden.

03:54.660 --> 03:56.220
I'll not be taken for a hippo.

03:56.220 --> 03:57.940
Come on, let's run for it.

03:57.940 --> 03:59.100
Hey, wait.

03:59.100 --> 04:01.580
There's a nice cozy cage already for you.

04:01.580 --> 04:02.900
Hurry, Snort Maiden.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.660
Ask to them.

04:04.660 --> 04:05.580
Stop them now.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.420
Don't let them get away.

04:07.420 --> 04:08.180
Huh?

04:08.180 --> 04:10.020
Where are we going, Moomin?

04:10.020 --> 04:11.020
Now to the sea.

04:14.100 --> 04:14.780
Quickly, man.

04:14.780 --> 04:16.700
Lower the light, boat.

04:16.700 --> 04:18.420
They're not going to put us in any zoo.

04:23.700 --> 04:24.860
Why did you come back?

04:24.860 --> 04:26.980
I thought you were on the boat.

04:26.980 --> 04:27.820
Oh, no.

04:27.820 --> 04:30.780
Don't worry, I never eat anything when I'm not swimming.

04:30.780 --> 04:32.340
Are you sure?

04:32.340 --> 04:35.940
I'm sure I know where's this ship.

04:35.940 --> 04:37.700
Oh, they're catching up with us.

04:37.700 --> 04:40.500
They want to put us in a cage and take us to the zoo.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.940
Me too, I expect.

04:41.940 --> 04:43.700
They're always trying to get me.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.140
They've got one of the crocodiles.

04:45.140 --> 04:45.860
Oh, did they?

04:45.860 --> 04:47.100
They were my friends.

04:47.100 --> 04:47.780
Right.

04:47.780 --> 04:49.260
Hang on to me, you two.

04:49.260 --> 04:51.700
I'm certainly not going back to any zoo.

04:51.700 --> 04:52.740
Never, let's go.

04:53.740 --> 04:54.900
Oh, no.

04:54.900 --> 04:56.340
Now hold on tight.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.380
Come back, you horrible rascal.

05:01.380 --> 05:02.380
Come back.

05:06.380 --> 05:08.540
Moomin's been caught by a big snake.

05:08.540 --> 05:11.220
Yes, mama snorked maiden as well.

05:11.220 --> 05:13.780
Dear stinky, that's not true, is it?

05:13.780 --> 05:16.660
I wish people wouldn't realize that I almost never lie.

05:16.660 --> 05:19.140
I'm sorry about them, but I thought I'd better tell you.

05:19.140 --> 05:22.380
Oh, there aren't any snakes that big in Moomin Valley.

05:22.380 --> 05:23.900
There are tigers here, aren't there?

05:23.900 --> 05:26.220
Well, there's big snakes too.

05:26.220 --> 05:28.260
You brought the snake here, didn't you?

05:28.260 --> 05:31.220
Papa, I'm not saying that I believe him,

05:31.220 --> 05:33.100
but I think we'd better look for them just

05:33.100 --> 05:35.060
to be on the safe side, don't you?

05:35.060 --> 05:36.340
OK, don't believe me.

05:36.340 --> 05:38.420
I've told you so my conscience is clear.

05:38.420 --> 05:41.020
We're exactly to the snake attack them, stinky.

05:41.020 --> 05:43.180
Down in the swamp by the sea.

05:43.180 --> 05:45.100
Let's go, mama.

05:45.100 --> 05:46.260
I'll come with you.

05:46.260 --> 05:49.300
No, you'd better stay little, my, until Moomin, where we've

05:49.300 --> 05:50.620
gone if he comes back.

05:50.620 --> 05:53.180
He'll only worry if there's no one here.

05:53.180 --> 05:55.980
And stinky, you show us where to go.

05:55.980 --> 05:56.460
OK.

06:03.540 --> 06:04.500
Hi!

06:04.500 --> 06:07.620
Oh, oh, oh, I'm thinking now.

06:07.620 --> 06:09.820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

06:09.820 --> 06:10.780
Hey, you.

06:10.780 --> 06:13.460
Have you eaten Moomin and Snark Maiden?

06:13.460 --> 06:14.460
It's all right, mama.

06:14.460 --> 06:15.460
We're here.

06:15.460 --> 06:17.220
Oh, praise the boo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

06:17.220 --> 06:18.260
Say it.

06:18.260 --> 06:19.260
Me time you, friend.

06:19.260 --> 06:23.860
a very big friend. Please come in as much of you as you like.

06:23.860 --> 06:26.260
Stinky just told us that you and Snorkmaiden

06:26.260 --> 06:28.260
been caught by a big snake, so we...

06:28.260 --> 06:30.260
Where are you going, Stinky?

06:31.260 --> 06:34.260
She did chase us at first, then we managed to get on a boat,

06:34.260 --> 06:36.260
but they wanted to put us in a cage,

06:36.260 --> 06:38.260
so we jumped back in the sea, met the snake again,

06:38.260 --> 06:40.260
then they tried to catch her too,

06:40.260 --> 06:42.260
so she helped us to get away, and now she's our friend.

06:42.260 --> 06:44.260
Who are they?

06:44.260 --> 06:47.260
Men from the zoo. They've come to recapture all the animals

06:47.260 --> 06:50.260
and take them away from the jungle, and put them in cages again.

06:50.260 --> 06:53.260
Nice. Secondly, don't want to go back in the zoo.

06:53.260 --> 06:56.260
Papa, we've got to protect our friends.

06:56.260 --> 06:58.260
Yes, we have.

06:58.260 --> 07:01.260
I'm sure that the tigers and that nice rhino don't want to go back either.

07:01.260 --> 07:03.260
Oh, of course they don't.

07:03.260 --> 07:06.260
They want to be free and let begin our jungle.

07:06.260 --> 07:09.260
Why don't you go and explore it? I'm sure it'll be just like home.

07:09.260 --> 07:13.260
And if you see the zoo people, you can come back here, can't you?

07:13.260 --> 07:16.260
I'm sure you'll like it here, Missy Snake.

07:16.260 --> 07:18.260
Yes, I'm sure I will.

07:18.260 --> 07:21.260
Come on, I'll show you the jungle.

07:23.260 --> 07:27.260
I'm so relieved that you're both all right at home.

07:27.260 --> 07:30.260
So are we, Mama, but there's something we haven't told you.

07:30.260 --> 07:34.260
Yes, they thought we were hippopotamuses.

07:34.260 --> 07:38.260
What? Who did? They need their eyes, Destiny.

07:38.260 --> 07:41.260
The men from the zoo. They thought we had escaped from another zoo,

07:41.260 --> 07:44.260
and we're trying to catch us, and they nearly succeeded.

07:44.260 --> 07:48.260
Hmm, a rude. We're not at all like hippos, the cheek of it.

07:48.260 --> 07:51.260
So these men were only trying to capture our new friends,

07:51.260 --> 07:53.260
but you and Snork Maiden as well.

07:53.260 --> 07:55.260
And me and Papa if they'd known about us?

07:55.260 --> 07:57.260
That's right, Mama.

07:57.260 --> 07:58.260
They're idiots.

07:58.260 --> 08:01.260
Hippopotamuses don't wear aprons or right memoirs.

08:01.260 --> 08:03.260
That's really made me angry.

08:03.260 --> 08:06.260
I bet they never faced the wrath of a movement Papa before.

08:06.260 --> 08:10.260
I want to see you wrap yourself round and choke somebody.

08:10.260 --> 08:13.260
I know. How about the tiger?

08:13.260 --> 08:15.260
He do.

08:15.260 --> 08:19.260
I'd rather not. We became friends in the zoo.

08:19.260 --> 08:23.260
Oh, I know. Choke stinky. That'll be much better.

08:23.260 --> 08:28.260
Yes, my dewey did let us out of the zoo.

08:28.260 --> 08:31.260
Well, you're a great disappointment to me.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.260
I let you out because I thought you'd attack the movements,

08:33.260 --> 08:36.260
but you have tea with them instead. You're pathetic. You know that?

08:36.260 --> 08:39.260
I'm sorry, but we were brought up in captivity,

08:39.260 --> 08:43.260
and we never had to hunt for our food. All our meals are brought to us, you see.

08:43.260 --> 08:46.260
But your tigers, what do you eat them?

08:46.260 --> 08:49.260
Well, we love cat food.

08:49.260 --> 08:51.260
Cat food.

08:51.260 --> 08:53.260
Oh, I don't believe it.

08:53.260 --> 08:57.260
Yes, it's easy to chew and it leaves our fur all sleek and shiny.

08:57.260 --> 09:00.260
We like the yellow tins with the black cat. Don't we, honey?

09:00.260 --> 09:04.260
Yes, it's our favorite. You wouldn't happen to have any on you, would you?

09:10.260 --> 09:12.260
Oh.

09:24.260 --> 09:27.260
Mama! Papa, quickly!

09:28.260 --> 09:31.260
They're here. The zoo men are here.

09:31.260 --> 09:35.260
Oh, get all the animals into the house first, you.

09:35.260 --> 09:37.260
Hurry, moment.

09:37.260 --> 09:39.260
Okay, Papa.

09:41.260 --> 09:43.260
The zoo men have come to get you.

09:43.260 --> 09:47.260
Hurry, you'll be safe in the moment house.

09:47.260 --> 09:51.260
Quick as you can, Rhino, into the house. Go on.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.260
Now, Rhino, push them.

09:57.260 --> 09:59.260
I'm sorry.

10:08.260 --> 10:12.260
Um, I don't think that's a good place to hide, Mrs. Snake.

10:13.260 --> 10:16.260
I'm afraid that doesn't look quite right, Tiger.

10:16.260 --> 10:19.260
I thought I might just look like a thick rug.

10:19.260 --> 10:22.260
I'll just lie here like a beautiful porcelain ornament.

10:22.260 --> 10:25.260
They'll never know we're here, darling.

10:25.260 --> 10:30.260
Well, they'd never expect to find a Rhino under there.

10:31.260 --> 10:33.260
That's what I thought. Where are they?

10:33.260 --> 10:36.260
They can't just have vanished into thin air.

10:39.260 --> 10:42.260
Look, up there.

10:42.260 --> 10:44.260
In the chimney.

10:48.260 --> 10:51.260
So they're in there, are they?

11:01.260 --> 11:03.260
Papa!

11:12.260 --> 11:15.260
They've seen the snake. They're nearly here.

11:17.260 --> 11:20.260
Now, I want you to calm down and be quiet, everyone.

11:20.260 --> 11:22.260
We won't let them take you away.

11:22.260 --> 11:25.260
I promise you they'll have a fight on the hands if they try.

11:26.260 --> 11:28.260
Keep, please, my love.

11:42.260 --> 11:44.260
Hello?

11:45.260 --> 11:48.260
Hello? Hello?

11:49.260 --> 11:51.260
Having a picnic, are you? It's lovely, Dave.

11:51.260 --> 11:54.260
Not at all. We're all here from the zoo, sir.

11:54.260 --> 11:57.260
Oh, are you on some sort of expedition?

11:57.260 --> 12:00.260
Excuse me, but are you the owner of this house?

12:00.260 --> 12:04.260
Yes, indeed I am. I'm movement papa. What can I do for you?

12:04.260 --> 12:07.260
Why don't you consent out the animals hiding in your house?

12:07.260 --> 12:09.260
That'll do for a start.

12:09.260 --> 12:10.260
Animals?

12:10.260 --> 12:14.260
Oh, no. We have firm believers that they belong out there.

12:14.260 --> 12:19.260
Sir, you can't see from where you are, but I can assure you that there is a python sticking its head out of your chimney.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.260
A python?

12:21.260 --> 12:23.260
Yes, that's right.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.260
No, it isn't.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.260
It isn't.

12:27.260 --> 12:30.260
No, it's my daughter. She happens to look like a python.

12:30.260 --> 12:32.260
Not all the time you understand.

12:32.260 --> 12:36.260
Right, come on, man. We'll go and get the zoo's property.

12:36.260 --> 12:39.260
No, you will not enter my house.

12:39.260 --> 12:42.260
All right, well, you let the animals out. We won't have to.

12:42.260 --> 12:46.260
It's up to you, sir. There are no animals, and you won't enter my house.

12:46.260 --> 12:51.260
Now, wait a minute. I do believe, yes. You're one of those hippos, aren't you?

12:51.260 --> 12:55.260
I am not. I'm movement papa, and I am the owner of this house.

12:55.260 --> 12:58.260
No, you're not. You're a hippopotamus. How dare you?

12:58.260 --> 13:02.260
A hippo who owns a house, and it's also running an illegal zoo.

13:02.260 --> 13:04.260
Break down the doors.

13:04.260 --> 13:07.260
That is against the law.

13:07.260 --> 13:12.260
Oh, it is, isn't? Well, there's a nice cage winning for you as well, movement papa, hippo.

13:12.260 --> 13:16.260
I warn you, if you touch that door, you'll regret it.

13:16.260 --> 13:19.260
No, yeah.

13:19.260 --> 13:22.260
Great boys, let's go in.

13:22.260 --> 13:25.260
Charge!

13:26.260 --> 13:28.260
Ah!

13:48.260 --> 13:51.260
Now then, what's going on?

13:51.260 --> 13:53.260
Little Mike brought the inspector.

13:53.260 --> 13:56.260
Oh, right. What do you mean that you're doing?

13:56.260 --> 13:59.260
Ah, they're hiding animals from the zoo in this house. We want them back.

13:59.260 --> 14:02.260
I tried to reason with the hippo, but it was no good.

14:02.260 --> 14:06.260
Oh, have you know that's willful destruction of property, my good man?

14:06.260 --> 14:09.260
It's not willful. We're from the zoo. We got to get in somehow.

14:09.260 --> 14:14.260
Oh, have you, and can you be sure that there are zoo animals in there?

14:14.260 --> 14:20.260
You just take a look up there at the chimney. That's all I'm sure. Go on.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.260
See that python's head sticking out?

14:24.260 --> 14:25.260
That's odd.

14:25.260 --> 14:27.260
I can't see a python's head.

14:27.260 --> 14:30.260
But there was a python's head up there, I saw it.

14:30.260 --> 14:33.260
Ugh, I can't breathe.

14:34.260 --> 14:37.260
Now you listen to me, zoo man.

14:37.260 --> 14:40.260
Either you stop bothering my friends or I'll arrest you.

14:40.260 --> 14:42.260
Is that clear? Well, is it?

14:42.260 --> 14:45.260
Yes, sir, it is. But what about the zoo animals?

14:45.260 --> 14:48.260
You heard the inspector now go away.

14:48.260 --> 14:49.260
Do you see that?

14:49.260 --> 14:50.260
See what?

14:50.260 --> 14:51.260
The hippopotamus.

14:51.260 --> 14:52.260
What?

14:52.260 --> 14:55.260
The hippopotamus. He's the fellows from hiding all our zoo animals.

14:55.260 --> 14:57.260
We got a nice cage lined up for him as well, inspector.

14:57.260 --> 14:59.260
Oh, so that's your plan, is it?

14:59.260 --> 15:01.260
Ha, they want to take them all.

15:01.260 --> 15:04.260
Moomin, snork, me, mama, and papa.

15:04.260 --> 15:06.260
Hmm, the criminal conspiracy.

15:06.260 --> 15:07.260
Conspiracy?

15:07.260 --> 15:09.260
It would probably be called kidnapping.

15:09.260 --> 15:11.260
Once you can't kidnap a hippo.

15:11.260 --> 15:13.260
That's a movement.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.260
It could be white slavery, though.

15:15.260 --> 15:18.260
I'm sure I could add incitement to riot to the list.

15:18.260 --> 15:21.260
Now, I hate paperwork, so I'll tell you one.

15:21.260 --> 15:23.260
If you're gone within 10 minutes, I won't arrest you.

15:23.260 --> 15:26.260
Why don't you put them in the deepest dungeon, inspector?

15:26.260 --> 15:28.260
The one with all the rats and spiders and scorpions

15:28.260 --> 15:30.260
that'll teach them to put Moomin's encages.

15:30.260 --> 15:34.260
That's a good idea, little mind. They like animals.

15:34.260 --> 15:37.260
I'll start counting now.

15:37.260 --> 15:40.260
One, two, three.

15:40.260 --> 15:42.260
Get around men quickly.

15:42.260 --> 15:44.260
All right.

15:44.260 --> 15:46.260
We'll have to think quickly on this one, man.

15:46.260 --> 15:48.260
Come on, now. Does anybody have any smart ideas?

15:48.260 --> 15:52.260
Come on. We're running out of time.

15:52.260 --> 15:53.260
One minute.

15:53.260 --> 15:55.260
Look, guys, we're going to figure something out right now.

15:55.260 --> 15:56.260
Ready and look.

15:56.260 --> 15:59.260
One minute, thirty seconds.

15:59.260 --> 16:02.260
Two minutes. Three minutes, thirty seconds.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.260
Look.

16:03.260 --> 16:05.260
Leave us alone, way we're conferring.

16:05.260 --> 16:08.260
All right. Six minutes and fifty seconds.

16:08.260 --> 16:09.260
Time's up.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.260
You're cheating.

16:10.260 --> 16:13.260
The police don't cheat, and now you've got...

16:13.260 --> 16:15.260
nine minutes and thirty seconds.

16:15.260 --> 16:17.260
How about that?

16:17.260 --> 16:19.260
Nine minutes, fifty bucks, I give up.

16:19.260 --> 16:20.260
Everybody beat it.

16:20.260 --> 16:22.260
But we're still discussing it.

16:22.260 --> 16:24.260
No, we're not. We're getting out.

16:24.260 --> 16:28.260
Look, everyone, the zoom in, they're running off.

16:28.260 --> 16:29.260
Great.

16:29.260 --> 16:31.260
You've got to come and see this, Mama.

16:31.260 --> 16:34.260
Nine minutes and fifty and a half seconds.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.260
And don't come back. We'll be the dungeon for you.

16:37.260 --> 16:39.260
And I make that ten minutes up to you.

16:39.260 --> 16:41.260
You saved his little life.

16:41.260 --> 16:43.260
It was really clever of you to fetch the inspector.

16:43.260 --> 16:46.260
Well, there were too many of them for me to fight.

16:46.260 --> 16:49.260
Okay? Everyone, come on now.

16:55.260 --> 16:57.260
And so everyone was saved.

16:57.260 --> 16:59.260
And eventually, they all came out of the house

16:59.260 --> 17:01.260
to go and have fun in the jungle again.

17:01.260 --> 17:03.260
As long as the warm weather lasted,

17:03.260 --> 17:05.260
there were plenty of things to do.

17:05.260 --> 17:07.260
But one day, the weather changed.

17:07.260 --> 17:10.260
And cold winds blew down Moomin Valley.

17:11.260 --> 17:14.260
Oh, it feels like autumn has arrived.

17:14.260 --> 17:17.260
The jungle won't like the cold weather.

17:17.260 --> 17:19.260
Do you think it will die, Mama?

17:19.260 --> 17:21.260
I'm afraid it will, little my.

17:21.260 --> 17:26.260
It grew very quickly, so perhaps it will go the same way.

17:26.260 --> 17:28.260
And it did.

17:28.260 --> 17:32.260
The whole jungle withered and died in just one night.

17:38.260 --> 17:40.260
I think I've done a cold coming, Mama.

17:40.260 --> 17:43.260
I'm sorry, I can't get the house any hotter.

17:43.260 --> 17:45.260
I missed the zoo, at least it was warm now.

17:45.260 --> 17:47.260
Yes, this cold is awful.

17:47.260 --> 17:50.260
It would warm them up if we bird the dead jungle.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.260
Now they're happy again.

18:09.260 --> 18:11.260
But for how long?

18:31.260 --> 18:33.260
Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys.

18:33.260 --> 18:35.260
It's cold again.

18:35.260 --> 18:37.260
It's warm in our cages.

18:37.260 --> 18:39.260
What are you afraid here?

18:39.260 --> 18:41.260
Yes, free to have pneumonia.

18:41.260 --> 18:45.260
I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spending the winter here.

18:46.260 --> 18:50.260
And so all the animals decided to return to the zoo.

18:50.260 --> 18:54.260
Perhaps we'll let you come back next summer, Mrs. Snake?

18:54.260 --> 18:56.260
I like that, when it's warmer.

19:00.260 --> 19:03.260
Hey, look, the animals are on their way back!

19:03.260 --> 19:05.260
All right!

19:05.260 --> 19:06.260
That wonderful!

19:06.260 --> 19:08.260
Oh, it's good to see you.

19:08.260 --> 19:10.260
You don't know how much we missed you.

19:10.260 --> 19:12.260
Oh, good.

19:12.260 --> 19:13.260
Gosh.

19:13.260 --> 19:16.260
We'll come back right now, old fella. It's good to see you.

19:16.260 --> 19:18.260
Come on now, get back to your cages quickly.

19:18.260 --> 19:20.260
We've been keeping them nice and warm for you.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.260
Go on, off you go now.

19:22.260 --> 19:25.260
You look all right, but I'm sure you must all be starving.

19:25.260 --> 19:28.260
We'll do you a special meal tonight, all right?

19:28.260 --> 19:30.260
Ah, the hippos, too.

19:30.260 --> 19:32.260
For the last time, we're movements, not hippos.

19:32.260 --> 19:35.260
You must be cold as well. We'll warm up a cage for you.

19:35.260 --> 19:37.260
It'll be nice and cozy there.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.260
No.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.260
No, it just came to send the animals off.

19:40.260 --> 19:42.260
Hey, get a cage ready for the hippos.

19:42.260 --> 19:44.260
Well, you're nice and warm.

19:44.260 --> 19:47.260
At the risk of sounding repetitive, we are movements.

19:47.260 --> 19:50.260
Don't be ridiculous, you mullet here.

19:50.260 --> 19:52.260
But we're nothing like hippos.

19:52.260 --> 19:56.260
We know you're not purebred, but the public will never be able to tell.

20:01.260 --> 20:04.260
Do we have to stay here forever, Papa?

20:04.260 --> 20:07.260
Of course not, Momen. Don't worry. I'll think of something.

20:07.260 --> 20:10.260
You will, won't you? Have you got any ideas?

20:10.260 --> 20:14.260
Well, not yet, but I am a writer, you know.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.260
Don't cry, Snorth maiden.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.260
I'm sure there won't be only hay to eat.

20:23.260 --> 20:25.260
I don't mind as long as we're together,

20:25.260 --> 20:28.260
but what if they put us in separate cages?

20:29.260 --> 20:33.260
Well, that would be awful. They wouldn't do that.

20:33.260 --> 20:37.260
Well, perhaps the inspector will come looking for us.

20:37.260 --> 20:40.260
When he realizes that we've gone as well as the animals,

20:40.260 --> 20:43.260
he'll bring the full power of the Lord to bear on them.

20:43.260 --> 20:45.260
Oh, look, there's someone coming.

20:45.260 --> 20:46.260
It's Snorthkin!

20:46.260 --> 20:47.260
And Hamilton!

20:47.260 --> 20:49.260
And a little Mai! Snorthkin!

20:52.260 --> 20:56.260
Hi, Mumen. Don't worry. We'll have you guys out in just a minute.

20:59.260 --> 21:01.260
Please come out.

21:04.260 --> 21:07.260
Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to let you out.

21:07.260 --> 21:11.260
I'm in charge of this zoo. I'm afraid it was quite an understandable mistake,

21:11.260 --> 21:16.260
but please accept this token of apology from the Board of Trustees. Here you are, madam.

21:16.260 --> 21:21.260
Mr. Hemmilan and I went to the Royal Academy of Science just to sort all this out.

21:21.260 --> 21:25.260
We've been given a letter from the President stating that you are not hippos.

21:25.260 --> 21:28.260
Mr. Hemmilan's scientific background helped persuade him,

21:28.260 --> 21:31.260
so you can all come home now.

21:31.260 --> 21:36.260
Well, it just goes to show you must never judge by appearances alone.

21:38.260 --> 21:39.260
Mama!

21:39.260 --> 21:40.260
Yes, Papa.

21:40.260 --> 21:43.260
Do you think I should grow a beard?

21:43.260 --> 21:44.260
No, Papa.

21:44.260 --> 21:45.260
Papa.

21:52.260 --> 21:59.260
And so autumn came to Mumen Valley, a new season with different weather and different pleasures.

22:06.260 --> 22:12.260
They love the laughter and they love the living and the moments.

22:12.260 --> 22:19.260
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:19.260 --> 22:23.260
They're always happy and always at play.

22:23.260 --> 22:27.260
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:27.260 --> 22:30.260
The movements.

22:30.260 --> 22:34.260
The movements.

22:34.260 --> 22:41.260
They love the laughter and they love the living and the movements.

22:41.260 --> 22:48.260
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:48.260 --> 22:53.260
They're always happy and always at play.

22:53.260 --> 22:57.260
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:57.260 --> 23:00.260
The movements.

23:00.260 --> 23:04.260
The movements.

23:04.260 --> 23:10.260
The movements.

23:10.260 --> 23:16.260
The movements.
