75000	104760	The rain was falling on Moomin Valley as though the heavens had decided to empty
104760	115240	themselves. It was the wettest weather that anyone could remember.
134760	159160	Mama, can I borrow all this?
159160	166760	Of course, dear.
166760	168280	And this one too?
168280	170840	Yes, dear, but what do you need them for?
170840	172760	It's a secret. A secret?
172760	173720	Yeah, sure.
173720	177320	I'll want to see a back moment, but you can keep the jar if you like.
177320	185560	Thanks.
189160	203320	Oh, dear, oh, there are puddles everywhere.
203320	206760	Oh, dear, Mr. Hemmielen, what a mess.
206760	208760	Hello, Mr. Hemmielen.
208760	213480	Oh, good morning, Moomin.
213480	216880	Oh, it's all misty now.
216880	218480	What are you doing, Moomin?
218880	220800	Observing very closely.
220800	225040	Oh, splendid, my boy. I'm glad you find botany so exciting.
225040	227520	Oh, what exactly is it you're observing?
227520	230720	I'm sure I saw a beautiful crayfish in there.
230720	234240	Crayfish? Excuse me, young man, but that is the wallets.
234240	253920	Is he quite the most un-interesting field?
253920	257920	Oh, there it is.
264240	294240	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
294240	308120	Ahahahaha. I got him, I got him. I got him.
308120	310120	Oh, dragon.
310120	312120	Mm-hmm.
312120	314120	Mm-hmm.
314120	316120	Papa!
320120	322120	Oh, what have you got?
322120	324120	I don't know.
324120	326120	I don't know.
326120	328120	I don't know.
328120	330120	I don't know.
330120	332120	Papa!
332120	334120	Oh, what have you got?
334120	336120	I don't know.
336120	338120	Oh, what have you got there?
338120	340120	Oh, oh, nothing, Papa.
340120	342120	Everything's so fresh after the rain.
342120	344120	Oh, woman.
344120	346120	Yes, it is.
348120	352120	I've got to show this to Snuffkin before anybody else sees it.
352120	354120	Mm-hmm.
354120	356120	Mm-hmm.
356120	358120	Mm-hmm.
358120	360120	Mm-hmm.
364120	366120	Oh.
366120	368120	Mm-hmm.
368120	370120	Mm-hmm.
370120	372120	Boom, woman.
372120	374120	Boom, woman.
374120	376120	What have you got there, woman?
376120	378120	Oh, nothing. Nothing at all, little lie.
378120	380120	Oh, yes, you have, I saw it.
380120	382120	Lie to me.
382120	384120	It's just one of Mama's old jars.
384120	386120	Liar, liar, I know there's something.
386120	388120	I don't think there's nothing.
390120	392120	Then why are you hiding it?
392120	396120	Oh, why did a little mice see me?
396120	398120	It's not fair.
404120	406120	Dragon.
406120	408120	Oh, yeah, I was right.
408120	410120	It must be a baby dragon.
410120	414120	Probably the very last one on Earth and washed up by the rain.
414120	416120	A dragon of my own.
416120	418120	Well, that's wonderful.
420120	422120	Oh, I hope I didn't frighten you.
424120	426120	I know what I'll do.
426120	430120	I'll take the lid off the jar so you can get some fresh hair, little dragon.
434120	436120	See? That's better, isn't it?
436120	438120	Come on, little fella.
438120	440120	We'll give you a car to make you feel better.
444120	446120	Oh, that burnt me.
448120	450120	What a fierce little dragon you are.
450120	452120	Don't worry. I'll look after you.
452120	454120	I'll take good care of you.
454120	456120	And when your bigger and start to like me,
456120	458120	I'll take you swimming in the sea.
462120	464120	Oh, I'm sorry. You must be starring.
464120	468120	I'll get you something from my nighttime emergency food box.
468120	470120	I've got lots of things in there.
470120	472120	Bound to be something you like.
478120	480120	Go on. Take anything you want.
494120	496120	Oh.
506120	510120	Gosh, that's really clever, little dragon.
510120	514120	Move in. Lunch is ready.
514120	516120	Coming!
516120	518120	Now you stay here. Don't worry.
518120	520120	I'll be back in no time at all.
520120	522120	Remember, you're my own little dragon.
524120	526120	Oh.
530120	534120	Where's Sniff? I thought he was here as well.
534120	536120	He's collecting worms for fishing.
536120	538120	He'll be here soon.
538120	540120	We'll start without him then.
540120	542120	You know, Mama, certain people keep secrets in glass jars.
542120	544120	Secrets?
546120	550120	Oh, yes, a little secret that hisses.
550120	554120	Moment, Mama, I found this near the big puddle.
554120	556120	Thank you, Sniff.
556120	560120	Moment, I told you I wanted it back.
560120	562120	It's my very best one.
562120	564120	Sorry, Mama. I was so excited.
564120	566120	I must have left it when I found...
566120	568120	I mean, when I was...
568120	570120	And I'm sure you know who I mean by certain people.
570120	572120	Did you catch anything with the sieve, Moment?
572120	574120	Yes, he did.
574120	576120	Something that's now hidden in his room.
576120	578120	Big mouth.
578120	580120	If it's a secret little my.
580120	582120	Perhaps he doesn't want to tell anyone.
582120	584120	Yeah, probably because his new pet bites.
584120	586120	Well, it hasn't bitten you yet, hasn't it?
586120	588120	Huh. If it did, I'd bite it back.
588120	592120	Is it true? Does your secret really bite people?
592120	594120	Well, it couldn't bite very hard.
594120	596120	If it was small enough to go in a jar, could it, Papa?
596120	600120	I suppose certain people might keep other small things in jars,
600120	604120	beetles and spiders, mosquitoes, scorpions, or poisonous centipedes,
604120	606120	horrible things that multiply and multiply every week
606120	610120	and grow and grow until the jars are too small.
612120	614120	See? Like that.
614120	616120	And there'll be so many of them, thousands and thousands
616120	620120	and they'll take over moving valley and eat us all.
620120	622120	Oh, well, I haven't got a centipede.
622120	624120	Hmm. I wonder if centipedes come from out of space.
624120	626120	But this is the Earth's deer.
626120	630120	The rain could have brought them down from space, Mama, couldn't it?
630120	632120	Well, you could be right.
632120	634120	It was raining very hard yesterday.
634120	636120	And it wasn't like ordinary rain.
636120	640120	I saw a puddle as big as a lake.
642120	644120	What's the matter, Moomin?
644120	646120	It isn't a centipede.
648120	650120	Huh. We're on the right track, though.
650120	652120	Well, I'm glad it's not a poisonous centipede.
652120	654120	I shouldn't have liked that.
660120	666120	Oh, you're asleep. Moomin's little dragon.
670120	672120	Is it okay if I go see Snuffkin, Mama?
672120	674120	Have you finished already?
674120	676120	Yes, I have.
676120	678120	Tell them they mustn't go into my room.
678120	680120	Or they'll have to take the consequence, sis.
680120	684120	All right, Moomin. I'll make sure no one goes in there.
684120	686120	I promise.
686120	690120	Oh, but he's going to tell Snuffkin the secret.
690120	692120	I should think he is.
692120	696120	Best friends always come first, little Mai.
712120	714120	Hey, Snuffkin!
714120	716120	Hey, Snuffkin!
716120	718120	Hi.
718120	720120	Fishing again?
720120	724120	Yep. The cards told me that if I caught five minutes, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south.
724120	726120	South?
726120	728120	You're joking.
728120	730120	Not at all. I believe in the cards.
730120	734120	But Snuffkin, winter's not here yet.
734120	738120	I know that. But the cards tell you things for a reason, Moomin.
738120	740120	Do they really?
740120	742120	But it would be awfully few anyway, Snuffkin.
742120	745120	It's just awful. I mean, I'd be very lonely.
745120	748120	And anyway, who would I talk to, or tell my secrets to?
751120	755120	Oh, Snuffkin, quickly. You must come up to Moomin House.
755120	756120	Now?
756120	757120	Yeah.
757120	759120	Well, I suppose I could fish later.
759120	761120	No, no. There's no point.
761120	763120	But I have to catch five minutes.
763120	764120	Oh.
764120	767120	The fish won't bite after all is rain. You'd catch nothing.
767120	770120	It'll be better to wait until it stops flowing so fast.
770120	772120	Well, perhaps you're right.
772120	774120	So what's this big secret all about?
774120	776120	Hey, Moomin.
776120	779120	Have you ever seen a dragon Snuffkin?
779120	781120	No, of course not.
781120	785120	They all disappeared off the face of the earth many hundreds of years ago.
785120	788120	But perhaps they didn't all disappear.
788120	790120	What if there was one alive somewhere?
790120	792120	That's impossible.
792120	795120	It could be so small that it would go in a glass jar Snuffkin.
795120	797120	Are you sure you're not daydreaming Moomin?
797120	800120	But still, anything is possible, I suppose.
800120	801120	But you know me.
801120	804120	I have to see it right in front of me before I believe it.
809120	811120	Oh, where is it?
811120	814120	Mama promised me that she wouldn't let anyone in.
819120	821120	It's not here either.
821120	823120	Well, you were right, Moomin.
823120	824120	What?
828120	830120	Ah, there he is.
830120	832120	I think you've found a real dragon.
832120	834120	How do you get up there?
834120	836120	He mustn't fall. He might lose his tail.
836120	838120	Don't move, little dragon.
838120	840120	And Snuffkin, keep quiet.
840120	842120	He might get frightened and do something silly.
842120	844120	Don't worry. I'll soon have you down.
844120	846120	This will do. I'll lay it on the floor here.
846120	849120	Jump, little dragon. Don't be afraid.
849120	851120	Come on. Hold on to this.
851120	853120	It will bring you down slowly.
853120	855120	Don't panic.
856120	858120	I don't think it's a very good idea, Moomin.
858120	860120	You'll only scare him away.
860120	862120	Why don't you just leave him alone?
862120	864120	He'll come down when he's ready.
864120	866120	Dragons aren't helpless, you know, even little baby ones.
866120	868120	But he's so small.
868120	869120	Come to Moomin.
869120	872120	Come on. Don't you understand?
872120	874120	Hold onto that and I'll listen to that.
874120	875120	Ah!
875120	876120	Ah!
878120	879120	Ah!
883120	884120	Ah!
886120	887120	Look at him.
887120	891120	My dragon can fly. He's flying. He's flying.
891120	893120	Come down, little dragon.
893120	896120	You might question or something. Come down.
897120	901120	Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
904120	907120	Be careful, Snuffkin. He might bite.
907120	910120	I don't think so. He's a very unusual pet.
910120	913120	I think he'll like you more than me.
913120	915120	Ah!
916120	920120	What a charming little creature movements.
920120	922120	I think he'll like you more than me.
924120	928120	I think he'll like you more than me.
931120	934120	I think he'll like you more than me.
934120	937120	What a charming little creature, Moomin.
937120	939120	He's lovely. What's his name?
939120	941120	He's called Little Dragon.
941120	943120	Huh. I don't think he's lovely at all.
943120	946120	Small but savage, if you ask my opinion.
946120	948120	That sounds just like you, little mind.
948120	950120	You think so?
950120	951120	Ow!
953120	956120	No, oh, oh, oh.
956120	958120	Whoa!
958120	959120	Ow!
959120	960120	Now look here.
960120	962120	Ah!
964120	967120	He seems to have a thing about ears, doesn't he?
967120	969120	Steps Snuffkins, why doesn't he bite him?
969120	971120	Go on, Dragon.
971120	974120	Go on, Vitamy's really tasty, go on!
975120	979120	Good news, I think he's trying to heat up Snuffkins coffee.
979120	981120	He must really like him.
983120	985120	Clever little thing.
985120	987120	Well, I hope he's careful with that hot breath.
987120	989120	We don't want to start a fire.
989120	991120	All right, that's enough.
993120	994120	He might be useful.
994120	996120	When he's bigger, we can put him in the cellar
996120	999120	and he'll be able to heat the whole house just like a furnace.
999120	1001120	No, we will not.
1005120	1006120	Huh?
1009120	1011120	Go away! You passed!
1013120	1015120	Ow!
1016120	1017120	And you!
1017120	1020120	He only thought you were trying to get his flood.
1020120	1022120	I'll get him if he bites me again.
1022120	1024120	Just you watch me do it.
1024120	1026120	Come on, little dragon.
1040120	1042120	I'm sure that'll keep him quiet.
1042120	1043120	I'd better go.
1043120	1045120	Thanks for the coffee, Mumma.
1047120	1050120	Oh no, it'll suffocate him.
1078120	1080120	He only seems to like Snuffkin.
1080120	1082120	Well, we all like Snuffkin.
1082120	1084120	Stupid old dragon.
1084120	1086120	No, he isn't.
1087120	1091120	Mum and dear, why don't you take him to your room?
1091120	1093120	He'll be happier there.
1095120	1097120	This will be best for him.
1100120	1103120	Oh, I wonder if he'll come back to visit us.
1103120	1104120	Why did you do that?
1104120	1107120	He was cute and we could have always worn earmuffs.
1107120	1109120	You can visit him in Snuffkin's tent.
1109120	1112120	I expect little dragons already sitting on his shoulder.
1112120	1114120	It doesn't matter anyway.
1114120	1116120	Snuffkin's going south soup.
1116120	1118120	They'll be able to go together.
1118120	1120120	Oh, my dear, Mumma.
1120120	1121120	Never mind.
1127120	1129120	Well, you're a bit of a problem.
1129120	1131120	I don't want you here, little dragon.
1131120	1134120	Go on, go away. Go to Mumma.
1134120	1136120	Don't do that.
1136120	1138120	Oh, come on, please go to Mumma.
1138120	1142120	Look, you're very nice and it'll be fun to have you along.
1142120	1143120	But there's Mumma.
1143120	1146120	And he'd know you were here and you'd be upset.
1146120	1148120	Oh, there's another one.
1156120	1158120	That's the fifth.
1158120	1160120	Oh, dear.
1162120	1165120	Hmm?
1167120	1168120	Any luck?
1168120	1169120	Not bad.
1169120	1171120	Are you going far?
1171120	1173120	Oh, I'm fair away.
1173120	1175120	Would you like some fresh fish?
1175120	1177120	I'm sure you'll get hungry.
1179120	1182120	Yeah, what do you want in return?
1182120	1184120	A small favor.
1192120	1194120	Take this as far as you can.
1194120	1196120	Open the lid and just leave it.
1196120	1198120	What? Just leave it?
1198120	1200120	Yes, in a nice quiet place.
1200120	1202120	With lots and lots of flies.
1202120	1204120	Flies? What's in there?
1204120	1205120	A dragon.
1205120	1207120	A dragon, does it bite?
1207120	1208120	Well, it might.
1208120	1210120	This is a big favor.
1210120	1212120	I don't even like minnows.
1212120	1214120	Oh, they're not too bad if you roast them.
1214120	1216120	Keep the lid on.
1216120	1219120	But make sure you open it up later so it can catch the flies.
1219120	1222120	All right, as long as it doesn't try to bite me.
1222120	1224120	Don't worry, it won't.
1236120	1237120	Hello.
1237120	1238120	Hi.
1238120	1241120	Oh, well, where is he?
1241120	1242120	Who is that?
1242120	1243120	My dragon.
1243120	1245120	He must have come here, Snuffkin.
1245120	1246120	Oh, really?
1246120	1249120	I thought he was home with you, sleeping in your room.
1249120	1252120	No, I let him out.
1252120	1254120	Ah, well, dragons are very fickle.
1254120	1257120	All they really care about is big fat flies.
1257120	1260120	It's best to forget about a moment.
1262120	1264120	Did you catch your five minnows?
1264120	1266120	No, you were right.
1266120	1268120	The water is too fast.
1268120	1269120	Oh, really?
1269120	1271120	So I won't go soft until winter comes.
1271120	1273120	You'll stay here then?
1273120	1276120	Well, I'm sure it wouldn't do to go against the cards.
1276120	1278120	Now what a moment, my friend.
1278120	1279120	Oh, that's great.
1279120	1281120	You're staying, Snuffkin.
1281120	1282120	That's fantastic.
1282120	1285120	That's really, really good.
1285120	1288120	Ah, perhaps I shouldn't have painted the float bright red.
1288120	1291120	It might have scared those little minnows right away.
1291120	1292120	Okay, let's go.
1292120	1293120	Yeah.
1296120	1299120	That dragon was sort of stupid.
1299120	1300120	Baby dragons are.
1300120	1302120	They make the world's worst pets.
1302120	1304120	They never want to settle in one place.
1304120	1306120	Yeah, you're right.
1306120	1309120	It was very funny, though, when it bit little mice here.
1309120	1312120	I think it gave her a taste of her own medicine.
1313120	1317120	The woman was very happy that Snuffkin was staying in Moomin Valley
1317120	1320120	and not going south until winter.
1320120	1326120	And as for the dragon, well, who wants to be loved by a silly old dragon?
1326120	1333120	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1333120	1340120	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1340120	1344120	They're always happy and always at play.
1344120	1348120	The movements are having fun day after day.
1348120	1351120	The movements.
1351120	1355120	The movements.
1355120	1362120	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1362120	1369120	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1369120	1373120	They're always happy and always at play.
1373120	1377120	The movements are having fun day after day.
1377120	1380120	The movements.
1380120	1384120	The movements.
1384120	1391120	The movements.
