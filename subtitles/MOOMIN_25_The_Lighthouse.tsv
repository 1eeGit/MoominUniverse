92500	95500	All is peaceful in moving valley.
96080	98080	Mama waters the flowers
100060	103540	while Papa relaxes in the shade on the porch.
103540	106540	Look, Mama, Moomin Papa is sleeping again.
106540	108540	Hmm.
108540	110540	You had a long nap yesterday.
110540	111540	I think it must be the weather.
111540	113540	It's too hot and sunny for me.
113540	115540	I wonder if he's worried about anything.
115540	116540	Hmm.
116540	119540	You don't sleep if you're worried you do something about it.
122540	125540	But Moomin Papa does have something on his mind,
125540	127540	although it doesn't keep him awake.
127540	135540	He's having a nice dream as well.
152540	155540	Oh, a lighthouse.
155540	157540	Oh, that's it.
157540	160540	Oh, that's it, a lighthouse.
160540	162540	What about a lighthouse, Papa?
162540	164540	We're going to visit one.
164540	165540	When?
165540	166540	Right now.
166540	168540	Well, as soon as I find one anyway.
168540	171540	That should stop you being bored, Mama.
171540	173540	Oh, I'm not really dear, but it would be nice.
173540	174540	Yeah.
174540	177540	Oh, I'm really excited.
177540	180540	Just think I'm letting lovely water.
181540	185540	Yeah, I'll write an exciting, epic novel of the sea.
185540	187540	I'm sure it will be a great success.
187540	190540	If he puts some action in it, misses out the romantic stuff.
201540	203540	Stop it!
203540	205540	Stop it!
206540	209540	Tell me.
209540	213540	Does Moomin Papa want all of you to go away to this lighthouse?
213540	214540	Oh, yes.
214540	215540	It'll be great fun.
215540	217540	Just think of all the ships we'll be able to see.
217540	219540	Yes, that will be good.
219540	222540	Papa says he wants to write an exciting story about the sea,
222540	224540	with ships and storms and stuff.
224540	226540	Probably pirates too.
226540	229540	Oh, he's stuck writing his memoirs again, is he?
229540	232540	Well, I guess that might have something to do with it,
232540	234540	but I think he just wants another adventure.
235540	237540	Well, it sounds a bit odd to me, Moomin.
237540	238540	No, it's not.
238540	241540	We're going to live in a real lighthouse and save ships
241540	244540	from the rocks and being wrecked in terrible storms.
244540	245540	Oh, I see.
245540	248540	What do you think the lighthouse keeper might say about you moving in?
248540	250540	Oh, he won't mind at all.
250540	253540	It'll be company for it, and I'm sure he'd like someone to talk to,
253540	256540	looking after lighthouses a very lonely job.
256540	261540	Ah, but if you thought Moomin, that might be exactly why he chooses to do it.
262540	266540	You mean that he might want to be on his own all the time?
266540	268540	Well, some people like it like that.
268540	271540	Sometimes I like being on my own.
271540	273540	Not for long, though.
273540	275540	It'll be a lot of fun.
275540	278540	Snuffkin, why don't you come with us?
278540	280540	What to a lonely lighthouse?
280540	282540	Yes.
283540	287540	Oh, no, which one is it?
287540	289540	There, that's the one.
289540	290540	Where?
290540	293540	So small, you can hardly see it.
293540	296540	How long would it take us to get their Moomin, Papa?
296540	298540	A day or two, I should say.
298540	299540	It depending on the window.
299540	300540	But it looks so tiny.
300540	301540	Oh, I don't know.
301540	303540	Well, I think so.
303540	305540	How we know which one is which.
305540	307540	Oh, don't you worry about that.
307540	311540	I've got an old compass somewhere, and we've got the map,
311540	314540	then at night we'll be able to see the light itself.
314540	315540	Anyway, an old sailor.
315540	316540	An old sailor?
316540	318540	Well, I'm not really that young.
318540	320540	And you're no sailor.
320540	321540	Is this mutiny?
321540	324540	Don't be stupid.
324540	326540	How long do you think you'll want to stay, Papa?
326540	327540	About a month.
327540	331540	Oh, we all need to take lots and lots of food, then.
331540	333540	Well, bless me.
333540	335540	I think that'll be enough, Mama.
335540	337540	Surely there'll be somebody living there already.
337540	338540	Don't be stupid.
338540	339540	Of course there is.
339540	341540	A lighthouse must have a keeper.
341540	344540	Yes, a man dedicated to the sea,
344540	346540	suffering loneliness and hardship,
346540	349540	countless lives with no regard for his own.
354540	355540	Huh?
355540	356540	Is that you, Sniff?
356540	358540	Yes, hi, Mr. Hamilton.
358540	361540	I thought you'd be busy packing for the trip to the lighthouse.
361540	364540	No, well, I'm not going with them this time.
364540	366540	I've decided to stay here.
366540	368540	Oh, dear me, really?
368540	369540	Sniffkin said he was going.
369540	371540	Well, I have something very important to do.
371540	372540	Important?
372540	374540	Sniff is just a big whip, that's all.
374540	376540	Oh, shut up, little mind.
376540	378540	Ah, don't tell me to shut up.
378540	380540	I don't listen to whims.
380540	383540	Hmm, now, now children, no squabbling.
383540	385540	It wouldn't be fair to the others.
385540	386540	I'm not a very good swimmer.
386540	388540	You mean if you fell and then we're drowning,
388540	390540	we'd have to jump in and save you.
390540	391540	Don't fall in, then.
391540	393540	Anyway, you can hang on to an or something.
393540	395540	What if it got swept away?
395540	397540	We'll put a life jacket on you stupid.
397540	398540	Don't worry.
398540	399540	What about the sharks?
399540	401540	They might take a fancy to me.
401540	402540	Wait a minute.
402540	405540	I've not as aologist, but I don't think there are any sharks around here.
405540	407540	I'm sure I would have heard if there were.
413540	416540	Well, it's a real fine day for sailing.
416540	418540	We're a mama and the others.
419540	421540	Don't worry, Mum. There's no hurry.
421540	424540	Are you sure that isn't too heavy for you, Sniff?
424540	426540	No, not at all, mama.
426540	428540	It's a shame that you're not coming with us,
428540	430540	but if you've got something important to do, you must do it.
430540	432540	It won't be the same without you, though.
432540	434540	We'll miss you, Sniff.
434540	435540	Thank you.
435540	437540	Oh, dear, I left a jar of strawberry jam
437540	440540	and a whole batch of pancakes on the kitchen table.
440540	442540	Do you think you could manage to eat them?
442540	443540	Leave it to me.
443540	446540	Hi, y'all be lucky if there's any food left in the lard or mama.
446540	448540	He's a my.
448540	450540	Off we go, then.
450540	452540	Ike is away.
452540	454540	You won't have to road too hard.
454540	456540	The wind will pick us up soon.
457540	460540	Goodbye, I have a good time, everyone.
460540	462540	Goodbye, Sniff.
462540	465540	Now, don't forget to shut all the windows if it rains.
465540	466540	Will you?
466540	467540	No.
471540	473540	I'm on it.
480540	482540	Hey! Wait for me.
482540	484540	I want to have a good time too.
485540	487540	It's my way.
487540	488540	Huh?
491540	493540	Look, Sniff is still waving.
493540	495540	He's a sweet boy.
496540	498540	Let's keep waving, Moon.
498540	500540	Tell her we're out of sight.
500540	501540	Bye, Sniff.
501540	502540	Bye, bye.
502540	503540	Bye.
503540	504540	Bye.
505540	507540	No, I'm not waving good bye.
507540	509540	I want to go too.
509540	511540	Don't eat on the road, Mary Tabo.
511540	512540	We're gone.
512540	514540	It's no good shouting, little my.
514540	515540	He can't hear you.
515540	518540	He's giving us a great send-off, though.
518540	520540	For Sniff, he should have come with us.
525540	528540	Nancy, I'm going off and leaving me here on my own.
529540	530540	Sniff.
539540	541540	Sniff can, if you wouldn't mind,
541540	544540	I think we need some music to send us on our way.
544540	545540	What do you say?
559540	560540	Sniff.
568540	572540	Are you sure we're on the right course with the island, Papa?
572540	576540	Yes, the winds with us and the sails are fine.
576540	580540	I bet if we keep this speed up, we'll be there by tomorrow.
581540	585540	Well, if the wind stays like this, you could be right.
588540	591540	The wind's not dying down at all.
591540	594540	I'm surprised. I never thought we'd keep up this speed.
594540	596540	Now, make sure you're allergic to them.
596540	598540	Of course we will be, Papa.
598540	601540	If we carry on like this, perhaps we'll see the light from the lighthouse
601540	602540	while it's still dark.
602540	604540	Well, we don't want to hit anything at this speed.
604540	606540	Don't worry. We're watching.
606540	607540	We're watching.
607540	608540	We're watching.
608540	609540	We're watching.
609540	610540	We're watching.
610540	611540	We're watching.
611540	612540	We're watching.
612540	613540	We're watching.
613540	614540	We're watching.
614540	615540	We're watching.
615540	616540	We're watching.
616540	618540	Don't worry. We're watching.
618540	620540	Ah, this is the life.
626540	628540	Papa, the wind's dropped.
628540	630540	Well, that's strange.
630540	632540	It shouldn't happen that quickly.
633540	635540	Do you want us to start rowing, Moomin, Papa?
635540	639540	No, Snuffkin. I think we'd all better get some sleep.
642540	645540	Stupid wind. I really wanted to see the lighthouse at night.
646540	648540	It's getting foggy too.
648540	650540	I can't even see the stars anymore.
650540	653540	Right, Snuffkin. Wake me in two hours, and I'll take over.
653540	655540	Okay, Moomin, Papa.
670540	672540	What's the matter, Little My?
673540	675540	I thought I heard something.
675540	676540	Oh.
676540	679540	It's coming from over there somewhere.
679540	681540	Can you see anything?
682540	685540	No, but I can hear it.
687540	690540	It's so good I, and it's getting closer.
697540	698540	Little.
698540	700540	Moomin, Papa. Get up, Moomin.
700540	703540	Stop it, Little My. What's the matter with you?
703540	706540	You too, Moomin, quickly, before it's too late.
706540	708540	What's the matter, Little My?
708540	712540	I can hear her ship. I can't see it, but it's very close, and getting closer.
712540	714540	A ship? Where?
714540	716540	Over there, and she's bearing down on us.
716540	718540	Quickly, we don't have much time.
721540	723540	Yes, by the boobalier right.
723540	725540	We must let them know we're here, a signal.
725540	727540	Right? All hands on deck.
727540	730540	Maybe if we all shout as loud as we can.
731540	732540	Look.
740540	741540	Too late for shouting.
741540	743540	It's huge.
744540	747540	Look out, it's gonna hit us.
748540	750540	I think Moomin's right. What can we do?
750540	754540	It's too late for anything. Just brace ourselves and be ready to swim for it.
758540	759540	Huh?
759540	761540	Quick, get down, Little My.
772540	774540	I don't believe it.
774540	775540	Little My.
779540	780540	Huh?
781540	783540	That's hard. The ship didn't hit us.
783540	784540	Oh, yes, he did.
784540	785540	What?
785540	788540	It went straight into our rudder when nothing happened.
788540	790540	It went right through us.
790540	794540	Right through us. That's impossible she couldn't have.
794540	797540	I wonder if there was anyone on board that ship.
797540	799540	I can't see any lights.
799540	802540	I know, Snuffkin. I think it's a ghost ship.
802540	803540	A ghost ship?
803540	806540	Well, there's no wash and no damage to us.
806540	808540	It's the only explanation. I think she's right.
808540	811540	A ghost ship. We've actually seen one.
816540	821540	Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I need to sit down. All this excitement's too much.
821540	826540	Papa, don't they say that if you see a ghost ship, something terrible is gonna happen to you?
826540	830540	What happened in the first place to make it become a ghost ship? That's what I wanna know.
830540	837540	Well, that's just some old sailor's tail, Moomin. If it had been a real ship, we'd probably be sinking now.
837540	839540	Don't you think so, Snuffkin?
839540	842540	Yeah, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.
843540	846540	Come on, cheer up you guys. At least it was fun.
853540	856540	What's the matter? Has something happened? What are you laughing at?
856540	860540	It's so funny. Are you going to tell us?
860540	863540	Why didn't you wake me up, Moomin?
865540	868540	Well, I think it would be very rude.
869540	873540	Oh, what a beautiful sky. Just look at it.
873540	876540	Oh, the fog is lifting.
877540	879540	Oh, I said, don't stop.
900540	903540	Another beautiful day, not a ghost ship in sight.
907540	909540	The lighthouse.
911540	916540	Hey, wake up everybody. The lighthouse. I can see the lighthouse. We're there.
918540	921540	Oh, the sun shining. We must have slept for hours.
921540	923540	Oh, there it is.
924540	929540	This is ridiculous. We've been next to it all night. We could have gone and slept there.
929540	931540	I can't wait to go ashore.
931540	935540	All right, everyone. Jump to it. Manly old.
940540	942540	There's something strange going on here.
942540	943540	What is it, Snuffkin?
943540	947540	I'm not sure. Moomin Papa. Our boat didn't move at all last night. Did it?
947540	950540	No, it doesn't seem to have moved at all.
950540	954540	So why couldn't we see the light from the lighthouse, even when the fog cleared?
954540	956540	I can't work it out.
956540	960540	Yes, you're right, Snuffkin. It seems very odd. We should have seen it.
961540	965540	Well, perhaps the lighthouse keeper forgot to put it on, Moomin Papa.
965540	969540	I don't think so, little Mai. You can't forget a thing like that.
969540	971540	I suppose it could be broken.
971540	978540	There could be lots of reasons for it. Why don't we hurry up and get ashore, and then we can ask the keeper.
982540	984540	Look, there's someone in a boat.
984540	986540	Hmm.
986540	988540	It looks like he's fishing.
989540	993540	He knows about the lighthouse. He probably lives on the island.
993540	996540	Let's get closer. Easy now.
1004540	1006540	Hi there, good morning.
1009540	1010540	Any luck?
1012540	1014540	Not yet, but it's still early.
1015540	1019540	Hmm, yes, quite. I'll ask him straight out.
1019540	1023540	Do you know if the lighthouse was working last night?
1023540	1027540	I don't know. Sorry, I didn't catch that.
1029540	1032540	He said, no, it wasn't.
1032540	1034540	What did I tell you? He forgot to light it.
1034540	1040540	Oh, it wasn't only last night. You'll never see a light in that lighthouse, not even on stormy nights.
1041540	1044540	Never. So what does the keeper do then?
1044540	1047540	Nothing. There isn't a lighthouse keeper.
1047540	1049540	Why?
1049540	1054540	I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't know. All I can say is I haven't seen one.
1054540	1056540	Do you live on the island?
1056540	1062540	Hey, mister. You're asking too many questions. Who are you?
1062540	1066540	I'm Moment Papa from Moment Valley, and this is my family.
1066540	1069540	We've come a long way in order to do some important work here.
1069540	1073540	No work on this island. No, you better go back home.
1073540	1078540	You see, I've come here to research an epic novel about the sea.
1078540	1082540	Just turn around and go back. You're too far from home.
1082540	1084540	Oh, please, wait!
1084540	1088540	Shh, dear. Don't shout. We mustn't scare the fish away.
1088540	1092540	Let's go ashore and have some breakfast. I expect we're all hungry.
1100540	1104540	Bonnie, pair. The old ones lost his marbles.
1123540	1127540	Look, Moment Papa. There's a path there leading to the lighthouse.
1128540	1131540	We'll leave this stuff here and we'll go and explore it first.
1131540	1134540	Right. To the lighthouse, everyone. Up.
1134540	1135540	Oh!
1135540	1137540	Come on!
1139540	1143540	What's wrong? Why do you always get so upset when somebody mentions the lighthouse?
1143540	1147540	It's not your call, sir. Business boy doesn't concern you at all.
1147540	1151540	You were like that when I asked you about it before. Maybe if you were to tell me,
1151540	1154540	I might be able to understand. I could try anyway.
1155540	1159540	Either talk about something else or keep quiet. Do you understand that?
1174540	1177540	It's so very rocky. I don't think it would work. What?
1177540	1179540	A garden.
1185540	1192540	Hello there. Is there anybody at home?
1192540	1197540	There's nobody here. That boy was right. It's been empty for ages, I think.
1200540	1205540	Oh, the door was left unlocked. I know we do it, but most people don't.
1205540	1210540	Something terrible's happened. Something terrible. Please, little my. You know I hate things like that.
1210540	1215540	Don't worry, snorke may done. Little my is just trying to scare you.
1215540	1218540	I don't like hearing about anything horrible.
1218540	1223540	Flag your ears and snorke made, because I haven't finished yet, and the next bit's really horrible.
1223540	1226540	Oh, well, where have you been finished there?
1226540	1232540	Well, the lighthouse keeper is still up there. He got scurvy and had to be able to move for months.
1232540	1236540	And nobody's heard his cries for help, and with no food, he's almost a skeleton.
1236540	1241540	If he isn't dead already, he'll be at the top of the stairs, crawling towards his fingers,
1241540	1245540	lading and ripped up ribbons and flowers, mouth, garbage, that was tearless mouth.
1245540	1246540	Shut up, little my.
1246540	1249540	Reminds right, that's enough.
1249540	1251540	It's a good imagination, though.
1251540	1253540	I'll let you use it in your book, if you like.
1253540	1256540	Oh, come on. Tell me what did she say, Moonman?
1256540	1258540	Oh, nothing, really. Nothing at all.
1258540	1262540	Tell me, Moonman, but leave out the bits I wouldn't like.
1262540	1265540	Where are you going, Papa?
1265540	1267540	Well, listen, everyone.
1267540	1270540	First, I'm going to get the lamp working.
1270540	1273540	Then we'll give the place a good clean, and then we'll move in.
1273540	1278540	We'll be the new lighthouse keepers, and once again, the seas around this island
1278540	1281540	will be safe for ships to navigate in troubled water.
1281540	1282540	Good old Papa!
1282540	1283540	Great!
1283540	1284540	Careful, everyone.
1284540	1286540	Take anything, that's dangerous.
1292540	1293540	Oh!
1293540	1294540	Oh!
1303540	1306540	Will Moonman Papa be able to get the light working again?
1306540	1308540	Where is the lighthouse keeper?
1308540	1311540	And what could have made him go without locking the door,
1311540	1316540	leaving the ships in peril and the seas with no one to guide them away from the rocks?
1318540	1321540	And who is the mysterious fisherman?
1324540	1330540	They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moonman's
1330540	1338540	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moonman's
1338540	1342540	They're always happy and always at play
1342540	1349540	The Moonman's are having fun day after day, the Moonman's
1349540	1359540	They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moonman's
1359540	1367540	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moonman's
1367540	1371540	They're always happy and always at play
1371540	1378540	The Moonman's are having fun day after day, the Moonman's
1378540	1388540	The Moonman's
