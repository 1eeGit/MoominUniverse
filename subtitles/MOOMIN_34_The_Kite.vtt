00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:46.000 --> 00:59.000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

01:16.000 --> 01:39.200
Winter was just around the corner and that was the time of year for movement to get restless.

01:39.200 --> 02:00.400
Because this was the time of year for Snuffkin to leave Moomin Valley on his yearly trek south.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.200
Good morning, Papa. That bonfire looks inviting.

02:03.200 --> 02:10.400
Now you're up already. We're buried in leaves this morning after that wind last night.

02:10.400 --> 02:15.200
Yes, winders on the way. Oh, this is a lovely bonfire.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.200
Yes, isn't it?

02:17.200 --> 02:22.400
I guess we're hibernating again this winter. Are we moving, Papa?

02:22.400 --> 02:26.800
Well, of course. We always hibernate in the winter.

02:26.800 --> 02:32.400
If Snuffkin says I could go with him, couldn't I give this winter a miss and hibernate longer next year?

02:32.800 --> 02:35.600
Mord. Oh, please, Moomin, Papa.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.800
Snuffkin would rather go alone, I think, Moomin.

02:38.800 --> 02:42.000
But I might get him to train his mind.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.200
But Snuffkin's not really a person who likes to be pressed.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.200
Why not?

02:47.200 --> 02:53.600
Well, he's a very solitary person. His winter trip is the only time he can really be alone for a while.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.400
I know, but I was just hoping.

02:56.400 --> 03:00.000
Snuffkin likes you very much. I know that.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
And I think that's why he stays in Moomin Valley for the rest of the year.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.200
But at heart, he's a vagabond and he needs time away from us.

03:09.200 --> 03:12.400
He's not a family man, so he's free to do as he wants.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.600
And as his friend, you should try to understand.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.600
I know you'd like to go with him, but I don't think it is such a good idea.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.000
He'd really hate to turn you down, I know.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I guess.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
But he'd have to.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Oh.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Oh.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Why aren't they biting?

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
I haven't had a proper catch for days.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Getting too cold, is that?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
When are you leaving?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
You're about to leave, aren't you?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Yes.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Could I ask you something?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
What?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Don't go without telling me.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
But why?

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
I'm always sad when you leave, even though I know you'll return in the spring.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Yeah. Me too, sort of.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
That's why this year I'd plan to leave without saying anything.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I'd like to wish you good luck and all that.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I miss you so much when you're away.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Please, Snuffkin.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Moomin, I have a better idea.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I won't leave until after you've started hibernating.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Then you won't miss me, will you?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
You're right.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I'll take a great idea, Snuffkin.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Then we won't really part at all, won't we?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Nope.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Because I promised to be back here in Moomin Valley before you even woken up.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Wonderful. What a super idea.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Hey, Moomin!

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Oh, Snuff.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Moomin, come here a minute.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
There's something funny caught up in a tree.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
What do you mean, funny?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I don't know exactly. Never saw anything like it before.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Snortmain a little my-founded first, but it's too high to get it down.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Okay, I'll come have a look.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Be careful.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Be careful. What is it, Moomin?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I know what it is. It's a kite.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Oh, what?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
A kite is something you fly in the sky.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
But it has no wings.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
No, you send it up against the wind on a string.

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
That's right!

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Oh!

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
That's right.

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
Where'd it go?

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Oh, through it though.

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
That's all right.

06:20.000 --> 06:29.000
Oh, song, this is what a kite looks like.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Looks broken to me.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
I'm sure we can fix it and make it fly.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Let's see.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Oh, no.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
The string must have broken when someone was flying it

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
and the wind blew it down into the tree.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Well, why don't we repair it?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Yes, let's.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Looks pretty badly broken to me.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, I don't know.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
We'll have to see.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
It is a kite, isn't it?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Can we mend it?

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Maybe.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
A very odd kite.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
It must have come from far away.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
You think it can be repaired?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Of course.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Well, come on then.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Snork will help you repair it.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I can repair it without your help.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
As long as you can find us some really long string,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
strong but not too thick if possible.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I think I have what you need.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Some string.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Good. Excellent.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I'll start immediately.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Good.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Good.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Good.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Good.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Good.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Good.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Good.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Good.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Good.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Good.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Good.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Good.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Good.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Good.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Good.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Good.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Good.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
Good.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Good.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Good.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Good.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
A really exciting project I haven't flown a kite for years.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
I do hope that string is long enough.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Snowark, is this okay?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Fine, who's gonna fly it?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I'll do it.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Ok, Sniff.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Moving, hold the kite up high.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Like this?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Hmm.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Alright, Sniff, are you ready?

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
Yeah, I'm ready. Don't let go till I say win.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Hmm?

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Win, moment!

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Oh!

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
Uh oh, it's falling.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
Try again, and this time start running, and when the wind catches the kite, you start paying out the light.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Alright, fine. Hold it up again, moment.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Right.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Ready?

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Yeah, I'm ready. Let go of it!

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
Is it going up yet?

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
No, it isn't!

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
Stop, Sniff! You're breaking the kite!

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
I don't think this kite's any good for anybody!

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
The kite's fine. It's just that the wind is too weak.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Alright, we'll have to wait for it to get stronger.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Titty though, we certainly had a good strong wind yesterday.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Is it okay?

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I think the wind is getting stronger, moment.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
There it goes!

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
With me, hold the string, moment.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Boy, this wind is really strong! Can I let out the string now?

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Do it slowly, mind. Alright!

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
Let me do it, Sniff, come on, it's my turn!

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
Let me break your kite, little boy.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Why not? Because you don't win, I'm told it!

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I'm very strong!

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Boy, it's quite right, you go up with it!

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
You're Sniff!

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Yes, Papa?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
It's difficult to hold it for a while.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Well, yes, you'd like it.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Hold it really tight, then.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Alright, I could do this long before he was born.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Oops!

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
What's happening?

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Papa, why did you drop quickly?

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Hey, I'm winding, I'm winding.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Faster!

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Oh, winding faster!

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
That was definitely not my fault.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Of course it wasn't, with such a strong wind up there,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
I think we have to lower the center of gravity a bit.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
The kite's alright, Papa?

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Hmm, maybe it would take me with it.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
That's it!

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
I suppose that's to stop it from spinning around, is it snorke?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Yes, that's right.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
What is it?

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Listen, I'm going to ride that kite.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
What did you say?

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
I think it's going to be okay now.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
If I hold on really tight, I think I could have a wonderful ride on that kite.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Yes, maybe it'd be wonderful while you're up in the sky,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
but you've seen how fast it can come down again.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
But the snorke just said it won't fall down again.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Even so!

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
I'm going to do it.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
But no one must see me or they might try to stop me if they guess what I'm up to.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Oh, please don't do it.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
What are you doing?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Listen carefully.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Yes.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
When we fly the kite next time...

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Huh?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
What are you two whispering about?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
We weren't snorked, Maiden.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
I was just saying to Sniff that the kite wouldn't fall down again.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
It won't! Snork is fixed it.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
But you can't be absolutely sure.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
And you'll be holding the kite, won't you, Sniff?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Me?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Now then, do you want to do it, woman?

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Yes, and this time I'll let out all the line.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
And Sniff, you could hold it up, okay?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Yes, that's fine.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I'm counting on you, Sniff.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
And so am I, Sniff.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Are you sure you'll be all right?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Of course I will, silly.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Well, I'm not so sure.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Why don't you keep your eyes closed then?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Good idea.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Okay, Sniff.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Let go of it when I say ready.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Bye.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Ready!

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah!

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
That's it. That's all of the line.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
It's very high.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Must be some wind up there.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
It's flying really well, isn't it?

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Certainly is.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
This is getting bumpy.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Oh!

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
What's that?

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
I'd say there's something very strange happening on that kite.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
What is it?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I can't see properly from here.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I saw something.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Could it be a bird, maybe?

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
The kite is turned again, but it wasn't a bird.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Or a twig or something, then?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I can't see.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Do you see the back of the kite from where you are, Sniff?

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
No, Mom and Mama, because my eyes are closed.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Oh.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I think I know who it is.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Little Mai.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
What?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
No, I haven't seen that on my phone.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
She seems to have disappeared.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Don't ask me anything.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I know nothing at all about it.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Sniff, what do you mean?

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
She was dead set on riding the kite.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
I couldn't stop her.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
What?

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Moment, bring it down very slowly.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Huh?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Take it easy, Moment.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
That wind is strong.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
It could break the line.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
But that was what a friend was best streamed.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
It's the knot I wore in the board knot.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
The warmth between our line and the bit that was still hanging from the kite when we found it.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
The knot is fine.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
If the knot is another knot.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
It's over.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Oh my God.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
It's over.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
It's over.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
It's over.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Hang on tight.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Little Mai.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
That wind is getting stronger.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Oh, this is more scarier than I thought.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I'll just have to hang on as best as I can.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Don't move around so much.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I can't help it.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
It's almost down.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
What?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Oh.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
It's not open.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Come on.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Jeff, get up.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
All right.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Snort, play yourself together.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Yes, all right.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
She's being blown away towards lonely mountain.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Snort.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Oh.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
I do hope little Mai really is indestructible.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Where in the world is this kite taking me?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
All lonely mountains.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I'm a long way from home.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Little Mai.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Little Mai.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Now she's going towards the forest of witches.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
She'll be all right if she fell into a tree when she...

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
I can't see her.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
There's no sign of her.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Well, I'm almost sure she was heading this way.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
What is it, Sniff?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Imagine she might have fallen somewhere.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
She might be lying there waiting for help.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Oh, stop imagining things, Sniff.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
She's still up there.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
I'm sure of it.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
What is it, Papa?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I saw something up there.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Little Mai?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
No, Sniff.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
No, it looked more like the Hobgoblin riding his panther through the sky.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Really?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Did you see that?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Did you?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
You found me, Mai.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
No, the Hobgoblin.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Then it was him.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Forget the Hobgoblin.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
We're looking for Little Mai and all you can think of is the Hobgoblin.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Hobgoblin.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Oh, come on.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
I won't shoot you.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Stop it, you're screaming.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Let go of my hair.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Stop it.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Where could she be?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
This is no good.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
We'll never find her wondering about like this.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Moomin, over here.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
You found her?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
There she is.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Try to cheer up, Snork Maiden.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
I'll try.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Don't worry, Snork Maiden.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Moomin, Papa, will find her for sure.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
Mama, Snork Maiden!

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
I'm so glad to see you.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
But I just knew you'd be all right.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
Like Moomin Mama said, Little Mai really is indestructible.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
But just possibly it served her right to have her hair pulled.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
There's still no sign of Little Mai?

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
No.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Be careful, Moomin!

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Lizzo!

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Be careful, Moomin!

21:03.000 --> 21:27.360
Finally, the name was rescued too, but he almost certainly had a fun worst scare than

21:27.360 --> 21:28.320
that were all mine.

21:57.360 --> 22:07.360
The move ends, the move ends
