    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They are the movements.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, what do you think?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.879
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. Yeah, with me, they're for you on your TV. They are the movements.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.839
They are the movements.

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.079
So come with me, give me your hand.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.159
I'll take you up to a moment land.

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.920
You can fly just like a bird.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.359
Sing that song ever.

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.280
There were the movements.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.000
There were the movement, there was the movement,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
There was the movement, there was the movement,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:30.000
There was the movement, there was the movement, When the Hennon first told Moomin about the golden fish, to himself that it must look something like this.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
My grandpa told me that his mother had actually seen it. So you never saw it yourself, Mr. Hamlin?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
No, I'm a batonist.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It comes to the surface only under very special conditions.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It's very rarely seen.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.840
Conditions? Yes. First of all, it must be right between summer and autumn.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.640
But that's now. Yes. It has to be in the afternoon sunshine after heavy rain.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.159
Oh, yes, that does narrow it down. And there must be no wind. Grandpa said not even a ripple on the water.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.680
Oh dear. And there are some other conditions that he really didn't

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:14.120
know about anyway to see it. You must be extremely lucky. Hmm. Just getting to the lake itself

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:22.560
isn't too easy. It's way beyond lonely mountains. Going over lonely mountains and back would

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.599
take at least two days. Not really, because I know a shortcut movement.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.080
I could take you there and back in one day.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.639
Oh, could you do that?

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:31.520
Yes.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.280
Have you already been there, Snuffkin?

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.599
Just once.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.680
Oh, will you show me the way?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.080
You really want to go?

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.879
Yes.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.280
I must see that golden fish with my own eyes and maybe capture it.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.039
It won't be easy to capture.

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:47.400
Why not?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.199
From what I've heard, the golden fish is far too clever to get caught.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.919
I know, but it would be so much fun.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.039
You going alone?

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.960
Well, Snorkmaiden said she wanted to come along.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.719
She gets these ideas, you know.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.759
Just Snorkmaiden?

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.120
Uh, maybe a little my.

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.159
What about Sniff?

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.000
I think he wants to come along too.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.199
For both you. In that case, we'd better go across the mountains. Why's that? Why can't we take the shortcut?

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:18.800
The path is rather steep and dangerous, you know, Moomin. Especially in the forest of witches.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:27.000
I know witches? Not now, maybe. Oh, so it's safe then. But it's a very deep forest, dark and scary even in daytime.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:45.000
That's okay, we'll Don't go. Shh.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Shh.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Shh.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Shh.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Shh.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Shh.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Shh.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Shh.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Shh.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Shh.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Shh.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.599
Shh. Shh. Shh. Oh dear!

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:29.279
Good morning, Snuffkin! Sorry, Snuffkin, guess I overslept.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.480
Snort Maiden a little my aunt here yet.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.480
You're very early.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.040
Hmm, I dreamt I caught the golden fish, and then of course I couldn't go back to sleep.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.480
Well, let's go.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.079
Shouldn't we wait for Snort Maiden a little my?

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:44.800
Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.000
And anyway, didn't we decide that we wouldn't wait for anybody? Wait for snork maiden and little Mai? Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.839
And anyway, didn't we decide that we wouldn't wait for anybody?

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:50.399
So it might be better this way.

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:52.399
What's better this way, woman?

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:55.680
Oh, little Mai.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.959
Why don't you stay here?

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:58.800
This will be a very tough expedition.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.560
I'm tougher than you.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:08.000
Wait for me!

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Hey, you walk any faster, Snapp? I'm still so sleepy!

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Why did we have to leave so early, Moomin?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
To get there back in a day, Snorkemaid.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But we aren't taking the shortcut, are we?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Yes, but it still might get dark before we're back.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.540
I won't be able to walk back this fast, you know,

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.939
because my bucket will be full of water for the golden fish.

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:32.639
Well, don't be disappointed if you don't catch it.

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.699
But that's my whole reason for going.

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.339
But you heard what the Himmielin said, Sniff?

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:38.980
We'll be extremely lucky to even catch

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.740
side of the golden fish.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.379
I heard him, and now's exactly the right time.

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:45.000
Maybe the others made too much noise.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
We'll just have to wait and see.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Don't you worry, I'll catch you, alright?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Where are they?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:03.000
We're going sorely in the morning.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.899
How far is the forest of witches? Where are they? We're going sorely in the morning.

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:11.639
How far is the forest of witches? I'd say about two hours.

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:14.779
And can you also tell us how long from one end of the forest

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:16.639
to the other's naufkin?

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:17.839
About the same.

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:20.040
Uh, eh.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.040
Eh, eh.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.519
Are there really such things as witches?

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:24.180
No.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.100
Baby, because I'm not a bit scared of them.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.300
Aren't you?

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.800
Not the least little bit.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.199
There used to be some, though.

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:31.199
What witch is?

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.199
Well, of course, sniff.

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:35.300
What else do you think that they call it the forest of witches, huh?

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.800
And you're absolutely sure that there are no witches now.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.800
I haven't heard of any coming back.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.800
Mm-hmm.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.000
So you're not absolutely sure that there are no wedges.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Where's Moomey and her still in bed?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
He was off before you woke up, Papa.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Hmm.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Oh, the golden fish.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Good morning, dear.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
I wanted to go with them.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
But you're writing your memoirs you're far too busy.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And that's very true, with the thought of the fish that no one has seen.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
That might have been a whole chapter.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Do you think they'll catch it?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
No, I doubt it very much. It's highly unlikely.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
In that case, you should have gone with them.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
No, I do know a thing or two about fishing.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Snuffkin does too, but he's still so young.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure Snuffkin will manage.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Oh, this is a spooky forest.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Maybe the witch is every time.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Stop it, little mime!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Listen, everybody, don't stray away from me.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Promise, you might get lost. Oh, it's so dark in here.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Sure, Razz, and so thick the sun can't get through.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000
That's because of those clouds.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I can hear the wind, but we need calm. That's because of those clouds.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I can hear the wind! But we need calm.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Yes, but we also need heavy rain.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
You're right. That's what the Hemiellin said.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
It sure looks like rain.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Not only looks like...

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:57.600
Oh, it's raining!

00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:59.279
Here. Oh, thank you.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.000
My God, I say this rainstorm was very sudden. Don't worry, it won't last that long.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
How do you know that?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Vagabons do.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
This rain isn't that heavy.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
No, it's not bad, but we better hurryer.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
We won't get to the lake till noon, and that'll be too late.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I don't think we'll get very wet down here, Mum.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So why don't we move on?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
You're so excited.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.960
What should we do? It's nothing so why don't we move on? You're so excited.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.679
What should we do, it's nothing.

00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:30.440
Well, we could move on, couldn't we?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:45.000
Yet! We really are getting too early. We better find some shelter quickly.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
About where can we shelter?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
There's nothing in this wood-exec tree.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
On your tree, then, again.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Yeah!

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
What is it, Snorke, Nathan?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:12.000
There's a house over there.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:27.000
It's fallen to wreck and ruin. Well, at least it'll keep the rain off. Hello there.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Anyone home?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:50.000
There's lived here for a long time. I wonder who could have been lived here all alone.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Huh?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I know who it was.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And so do we all.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Don't we?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
It's your lady.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Don't we? I know who it was, and so do we all.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
He sure is, don't mean.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
The witches, of course.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Look around for dried spices, magic herbs,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
brown sticks, and a black cat, a niren pot, a pile.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
But now, cruel!

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.200
No, the witch rode away on it.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.600
Oh!

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.399
There's someone here.

00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:34.399
Who is it?

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.399
Let's get out of here.

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:50.000
Can't come over there.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
No, don't. That's okay, Snuffkin. We gotta get out of this place.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Hmm.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I can't move, Snuffkin. Stinky? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm so proud of Snip the faint when he hears my voice. Where are you after anyway?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Oh, come on, tell me. Can't you even take a joke? Come on, wait for me.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
That way. Okay. Come on. Okay.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Come on.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Come on.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Come on.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Come on.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Come on.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Come on.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Come on.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Come on.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Come on. Come on. This is it, isn't it? Yes it is. Where's the golden fish? I really don't know.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I've never seen it either.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I've never seen it either.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I've never seen it either.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I've never seen it either.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I've never seen it either.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I've never seen it either.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I've never seen it either.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I've never seen it either.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I've never seen it either.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
I've never seen it either. I've never seen it either. I've never seen it either. I it? Yes it is. Where's the golden fish? I really don't know.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
I've never seen it either.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
With rain, sunshine and calm,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I'm sure the fish will come.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
The golden fish?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Help me catch it!

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I just gotta have that golden fish!

00:13:35.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Now! Oh! I can't see any fish anywhere. Maybe it was Hemiellin's idea of a very funny joke.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
The Hemiellin doesn't joke. Let's sit down and wait.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
I'm sure the golden fish will appear for us.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
I don't believe it. Do me the say you came all this way here just to see some stupid old fish.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I came to catch it.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Well, that's even more stupid.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Hey, stop making those ripples.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.360
Uh, I'm going to say you came all this way here just to see some stupid old fish. I came to catch it.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.600
Well, that's even more stupid.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.600
Hey, stop making those ripples.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600
Eh.

00:14:33.799 --> 00:14:37.799
So they really got excited and walked all the way, you say?

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:39.799
Oh, to be young again.

00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:43.080
Well, I would have gone with them if I hadn't over slept.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.000
I didn't know that you were that young woman, Papa.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Oh, I'm not exactly old, you know.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Pretty interesting to see a fish that hardly anyone's ever seen.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Snipset that he would catch this golden fish

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
if it's the last thing he did.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Oh, how?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Well, he had a net and a very large bucket to carry at home, then.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:27.759
That's a good one. What do you mean? and a very large bucket to carry at home, then. Hmm, can't see it from up here. Hmm, oh, the hemulin was certainly right.

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:30.120
Hardly anyone has seen this golden fish

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.799
and we're not gonna see it either.

00:15:31.799 --> 00:15:33.919
Maybe somebody ate a mure's ago.

00:15:33.919 --> 00:15:35.919
Stinky be quiet, please.

00:15:35.919 --> 00:15:37.419
Oh!

00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:38.659
Huh!

00:15:38.659 --> 00:15:39.919
Did you see it?

00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:40.919
Where did you see it?

00:15:42.919 --> 00:15:44.419
Huh!

00:15:44.419 --> 00:15:49.919
I saw a fish jump, but I couldn't tell if it was golden. It was much too far away.

00:15:49.919 --> 00:15:53.000
With the sun over there we just see the outlines, Nork Maiden.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Yes, we couldn't really see the color. Look everybody, look! I can see a raft over there!

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Hey, let's take it and go out to the middle of the lake.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
But it's much too small for all of us.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Don't worry, Sniff, this won't sink.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I'm staying.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
You do what you like, but you'll never catch any fish

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
if you're afraid of water.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Stinky, you can help me. It's gold, you know.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
We can sell it for a lot of money

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.240
and then we'll both be very wealthy.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.879
I think it was somewhere around here, wasn't it?

00:16:40.879 --> 00:16:43.480
Or, alas, I suppose, hard to say.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.000
Well, I can't see anything.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I can't see!

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
There's certainly no sign of it now.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Well, we'll just have to sit and wait here.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
We have no choice.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And I'm not going home until I've seen it.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I'm happy to wait all day.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
You won't find it by looking up at the sky.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
You know what?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Fish like it in places where there are lots of wings.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Oh, the rafts in the middle of the lake.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
They just want to see the fish, but you wait. I'm going to catch it.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Maybe somebody's already caught it and you can get it in a tin.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Huh?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Huh?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
What? Did you see that?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Over there! Something shiny jumping!

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
What did you see? That's all it did! Now keep quiet!

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.200
I hate fishing. Guess we better think about getting back otherwise we'll never get home before nightfall.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.880
I don't want to get lost on a raft in the dark on this lonely lake.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.480
Perhaps we were expecting too much.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.799
Maybe your right's not made in, but I really thought we'd see it.

00:18:03.799 --> 00:18:06.400
This is the most disappointing day of my life.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.000
We can come back.

00:18:08.599 --> 00:18:09.599
Yes.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:28.000
It's not gonna stop.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Hang on. Did you see a moment? Shh. Oh.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
It's gigantic. I'm not going to die. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh it! First, it was I believe about it! So great!

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Thank you, man!

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Oh, that was great!

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
I really saw it!

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
I saw it!

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
First, it was I believe about it!

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
So great!

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Thank you, man!

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Oh, that was great!

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Oh, that was great!

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Oh, that was great!

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
I really saw it! I saw it! First, it was I believe about it! Oh!

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Got it! Got it!

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Got it!

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Hey, I'm home in!

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
I did it! I caught it!

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
God, what?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Why the golden fish and horse?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
What?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
I've got the golden fish in here if you want to have a look at it.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
See, it's in this bucket.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
You don't really believe that is the golden fish.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
It's just another stupid fish. I can swear that it really was golden when I caught it.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
It must have been the sun making it land in the water.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
It was you said it was the golden fish.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.220
Why don't you let it go?

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.960
You know it's not the right one, and he hates it in that bucket.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.960
Huh?

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.640
Hmm...

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.400
There he goes.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.039
It looks so happy now.

00:20:58.519 --> 00:21:01.240
It really was gold when I first saw it.

00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:03.440
We believe you, Sniff.

00:21:03.759 --> 00:21:16.480
Now let's go home.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.240
Steph and Stinky never really got over their belief that it was actually the golden fish they had caught.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.039
But moving in the others were in no doubt about what they had seen.

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:47.000
They and the emulators were great friends. We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
They're always happy and goes at play

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
The moments are having fun day after day

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:07.000
The movements, the movements, the movements The Moons.
