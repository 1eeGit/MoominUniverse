1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,560
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:32,800
me here for you on your TV they are the movements they are the movements so come with me give me your hand

3
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:41,680
I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there with the

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:56,880
movements there was a movement there was a movement there was a movement

5
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,240
Ba ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba threat

6
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:43,680
With all the planets in outer space, there must be other forms of life different

7
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:53,280
that on earth. We don't know what they look like because no one from here has ever seen them.

8
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,480
However, we do know that they don't look like this because this is sniffed one of

9
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,480
women's friends.

10
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:53,280
So, it looks as though the rumor was right.

11
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,480
What rumor was that?

12
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,480
That we were about to be invaded by aliens from outer space.

13
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Oh, dear, do you mean that thing that was chasing me might have been one of them?

14
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,480
Well, yes.

15
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
I thought they were just after me.

16
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,480
I wouldn't have thought you'd have been that important to them sniff,

17
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
but I suppose you never know, knew you.

18
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:24,480
It says here in this book that aliens from outer space are very civilized and peace-loving and would never want to invade us.

19
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
It seemed as though they're quite happy where they are.

20
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
I do, it's not a very scientific book.

21
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,480
Well, it was definitely attacking me, Mom and Papa, I know it was.

22
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Well, it might have been a civilization from another planet sniff.

23
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,480
They were just hungry.

24
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,480
Huh? Well, the inspector told me that he thought we were being invaded by aliens, and he shouldn't know.

25
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,480
I'm sure he's exaggerating.

26
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
I wonder what they look like.

27
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Why don't you come and help me in the garden?

28
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
You never know, we might see one.

29
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Mama, wait for me!

30
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
Mama, what's that?

31
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Well, I would say it's not a vegetable, that's for sure.

32
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,480
It looks like a flying saucer.

33
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,480
I wonder if there are any aliens in it.

34
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,480
They might be heard, Mama.

35
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Let's have a look.

36
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,480
I think there's something there.

37
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,480
This looks odd. I wonder what it is.

38
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,480
It's a bit like a radio, isn't it?

39
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Oh yeah, an alien radio.

40
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,480
Do you think there's anyone in there moving?

41
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,480
Anybody there?

42
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,480
It seems to have been deserted.

43
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,480
There's a funny noise coming from it.

44
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Well, it doesn't look to me like it could fly again.

45
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,480
It could be repaired.

46
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
You'd need to know about flying saucers.

47
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Papa could do it?

48
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,480
I don't think flying saucers should make that sort of noise.

49
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
Do you, woman?

50
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,480
I don't think so.

51
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,480
But I don't know very much about them.

52
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,480
It does seem a bit odd.

53
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,480
As if they've said it to be blown up so that no one would be able to steal it.

54
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Because they want to keep the design a secret.

55
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Do you think it will?

56
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,480
Oh!

57
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,480
I'm not sure, Mama.

58
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
But let's get away in case it does explode.

59
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,480
That's why it's empty.

60
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,480
It landed in the Asparagus patch.

61
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,480
I'll take the radio with me.

62
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,480
It won't be too long now, Mama.

63
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
No, it won't.

64
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
It won't be long.

65
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,480
It's vanished.

66
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Less my soul.

67
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,480
Papa's book said they could be a very advanced life form.

68
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
There's nothing to show.

69
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
It was ever here.

70
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
Except the hole in the ground.

71
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
And this radio thing.

72
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Hmm.

73
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Is it a radio, Papa?

74
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
I don't know.

75
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,480
It looks a bit like one.

76
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Let's try pressing one of these buttons.

77
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,480
The red one first, I think.

78
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Oh!

79
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
Papa, where have you gone?

80
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,480
I'm right here.

81
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,480
I wonder what happens if I press this one.

82
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't see you either, dear.

83
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
What?

84
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,480
Oh, I see.

85
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,480
So if you press the red button, you become invisible.

86
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
What a fascinating machine.

87
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Papa, I think I'd rather see you, dear.

88
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Well, of course you would.

89
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,480
Well, let's try the yellow one.

90
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Can you see me now?

91
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
No, Papa.

92
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Oh, that's hard.

93
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Do you want me to try, Papa?

94
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Please, Mama.

95
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,480
Oh, Papa.

96
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
That's a very dangerous machine.

97
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
I don't want to disappear ever again.

98
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,480
It's not a nice experience.

99
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,480
No, dear. I didn't like you vanishing like that.

100
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
Well, we must put it somewhere safe, Mama,

101
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
where the children can't find it.

102
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
Yes, dear.

103
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Oh, Papa.

104
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
That's a very dangerous machine.

105
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,480
I don't want to disappear ever again.

106
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
It's not a nice experience.

107
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
No, dear. I didn't like you vanishing like that.

108
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
Even forgotten.

109
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Mumon.

110
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Snortmaiden, what an earth's the matter.

111
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,480
We found a strange creature.

112
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Strange creature.

113
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
I think it's an alien.

114
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Does it look like a jellyfish?

115
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
No, not at all.

116
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Little mice keeping an eye on it.

117
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
C'mon!

118
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Where are you going, Mumon, Papa?

119
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Going me out.

120
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,480
What do you mean?

121
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,640
Moving, Mum and Papa.

122
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,440
Going me? Oh, no, Especial.

123
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,840
Moving, Mum, I'll hang on.

124
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,240
I've got a few questions for you.

125
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,640
Really, Inspector?

126
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,400
I was told that a flying saucer

127
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,840
had landed in your garden,

128
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,080
but all I can see is a big hole.

129
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Where is it?

130
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,840
What have you done with the saucer?

131
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,920
Nothing.

132
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,120
Well, where is it?

133
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,960
It's not there now.

134
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,920
It was there, but then it just vanished.

135
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,120
Darnished?

136
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Yes, that's right.

137
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,440
When you say vanished, you mean it flew away again?

138
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,320
No, it just went, woof, gone.

139
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Moments are it, too.

140
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,400
That's very odd.

141
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,760
Yes, it was.

142
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,040
Did you see any aliens on board by any chance?

143
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,280
No.

144
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,160
Are you telling me the truth?

145
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,200
Of course.

146
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,960
Why should I lie to you?

147
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,560
Well, I can't.

148
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,760
Think of any reason.

149
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,240
I'm sorry, but it's upsetting aliens

150
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,040
invading Moment Valley.

151
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,120
Yes, it is.

152
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,400
Can we go now?

153
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,920
Certainly.

154
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,440
Where are you all going, by the way?

155
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,400
Oh, only to the beach to collect shells.

156
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,000
See you, Inspector.

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,640
Collecting shells, indeed, while I'm hunting for aliens.

158
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
Ah, over here!

159
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,280
Ah, Mom!

160
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,600
Ah, Mom!

161
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,840
Hey.

162
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,200
Oh, Aunt Lady, where are you now?

163
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,920
Where are you now?

164
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,400
Where are you now?

165
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,800
Is that an alien?

166
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,600
It certainly is, but not like it says in the book.

167
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,040
Have you tried talking to it?

168
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,840
Yes, but it wouldn't answer.

169
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,320
Let me try.

170
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,440
Are you from outer space?

171
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,560
G-so, what a单.

172
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,840
Why are you acting like a dacha-dacha-dacha-dali?

173
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,400
No-din.

174
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,520
Yes, it's not going to happen to me a little bit.

175
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:24,600
Looks like an alien child to me more like a lamp poor thing. He must be hungry. Let's take him home

176
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,320
Yeah, well, we don't want the inspector to see him

177
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:54,520
I'm sorry we can't understand you, but I'm sure you'll like me up even if you don't speak English

178
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Just try it and see

179
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,520
I think he's missing his home

180
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,520
Wherever in the universe that might be I wonder where his parents are he can't have come on his own

181
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,520
He seems far too little for that

182
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Well, I don't know

183
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,520
But he's obviously missing them and he seems very unhappy

184
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,520
Do you think the inspector would really arrest him moving papa?

185
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,520
Possibly, he would think it is duty

186
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Well, that would be horrible of him

187
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
I know

188
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,520
Oh, it's inspector

189
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,520
Oh dear, he mustn't find him here

190
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,520
And he's got stinky with him

191
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,520
Oh, stinky? Well, that means trouble

192
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,520
Quick, he can hide in the kitchen

193
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
We gotta do something!

194
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
And quickly

195
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,520
I know what to do

196
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,520
What mama? We'll use the machine

197
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Oh yeah

198
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,520
We'll just keep him out of sight

199
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,520
Now with him, this one is right

200
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
Oh dear

201
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
I think they're here

202
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Oh, moving papa, I heard there was an alien here with what?

203
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
What's happening?

204
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
What's happened to me?

205
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Oh dear, yes, how very, very strange

206
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
You look like a great big goldworm

207
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,520
An inspector in shining armor, you mean little my?

208
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
That's just what I thought

209
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,520
You'll never need a lamp to be seen, inspector

210
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,520
I like it, criminals will be afraid of me

211
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,520
I can't wait to get back to the station and show the constables

212
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,520
Handy for reading in bed, too

213
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,520
Well, duty calls, bye

214
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:16,520
D-D-D-D-D- im-d-D-D-D-D-D D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D

215
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
What are you doing?

216
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,520
I didn't know that the machine was still working

217
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,520
Or you can speak English

218
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
Of course I can

219
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,520
It's just that I need my language converted to help me translate

220
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,520
And if you hadn't taken it from my ship and hidden it

221
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,520
I would have been able to talk sooner

222
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,520
That's a good way to learn, isn't it?

223
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Where are you going?

224
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
To see that nice, shiny man

225
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
But he'll arrest you!

226
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,520
He came here looking for you, but he forgot about it when the machine started him glowing

227
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,120
No, don't go there. Hey, why?

228
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
What is it?

229
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
What?

230
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Oh, you're so bright and beautiful, Inspector.

231
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
Oh, you think so?

232
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Everyone shimmers like that, everyone.

233
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Well, that must be very nice for them.

234
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
I want to pose you, please.

235
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,520
I'm sorry, I'm too busy, but it was nice talking to you.

236
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,520
You see, the aliens have invaded Moomin Valley and I must find them.

237
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Oh, I just remembered.

238
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,520
I was tipped off that there was one of them in Moomin House.

239
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
The inspector's coming back.

240
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
What about the alien?

241
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
He's running after him.

242
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,520
Has he been handcuffed, Moomin?

243
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,520
I don't think so.

244
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Open up in the name of the law, Moomin Papa.

245
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Well, certainly for you, Inspector. Come on in. You're very welcome.

246
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Moomin Papa, I have information from a reliable source, well, sort of reliable.

247
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,520
That you have been harping a fugitive.

248
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
I'm sorry.

249
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,520
In other words, I believe you have been hiding an alien here.

250
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Oh, Inspector, I don't think hiding is the right word. That suggests we are trying to keep something from you.

251
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Well, Mama.

252
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,520
Would we do that, Inspector?

253
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,520
That stinky is tricked me again.

254
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
Isn't it lucky he didn't find you?

255
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
I want a nice inspector.

256
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Look, how many times must I tell you? He'll lock you up in an nasty cell.

257
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,520
I like him. I want to see him.

258
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
No, don't.

259
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,520
Perhaps if we press the yellow button, he'll stop shining.

260
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,520
A good idea, Papa. Be quick, Mama.

261
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
The yellow button.

262
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,520
You girls.

263
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,520
You don't want him now that he stopped shining. Do you, little fella?

264
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
No.

265
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Let's go home, then.

266
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Well, Mama, come and look. We've saved the alien.

267
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Well, Mama, the inspector's not glowing anymore. Isn't that something?

268
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,520
Mama?

269
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Mama, where are you?

270
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
I'm here.

271
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,520
Hey, what? Where are you, Mama?

272
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Well, Mama.

273
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
Right here.

274
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,520
Mama? Oh, no. What's happened to you?

275
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,520
I don't know. Probably that machine again.

276
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Oh, so it shrinks you as well as making you invisible, does it? Well, well.

277
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Oh, dear. I need an apron.

278
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,520
Papa, can you get a handkerchief from my handbag?

279
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,520
You really are quite small.

280
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,520
That you look very cute, of course, Mama.

281
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
Would you like to stay like that for a while?

282
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,520
No, I would not. Push another button quickly before anyone sees me.

283
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,520
Go on now. Hurry up, Papa.

284
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Yeah. Oh, dear.

285
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
What's up?

286
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
The machine's gone.

287
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Hey, you! Take me back!

288
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Hey!

289
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Papa!

290
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,520
Don't worry, Mama. I'll get it back.

291
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
Hey!

292
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
Hey!

293
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
Oh, thank you.

294
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
Look at that way.

295
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Stop him, Mama. Stop him. He stole the machine.

296
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,520
We'll get him, Papa.

297
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Hey, sniff!

298
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Don't let steam keep getting away.

299
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Right.

300
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,520
Leave it to me.

301
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,520
Please let me pass, sniff. I'll give you a gold stopper.

302
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
A gold stopper?

303
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
I mean, free. No, no. Five.

304
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,520
No. Give me the machine, Stinky.

305
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,520
Where is it, moment? What's happened to the machine?

306
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,520
It's at the bottom of the river, Papa.

307
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,520
Oh, poor Mama. Poor Mama.

308
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
What's wrong with her?

309
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,520
Well, she needs the machine to get back to normal.

310
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
Normal?

311
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Well, at least this is a chance to do some really fine embroidery.

312
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,520
Don't worry, Mama. I promise we'll look after you.

313
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
It's all right, Moomin. I'll manage.

314
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,520
I'll have to get some smaller pots and pans, though,

315
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
and we'll have to have smaller helpings.

316
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,520
But that might not be a bad idea.

317
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,520
Oh.

318
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:46,520
Here, here, my parents come for me.

319
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,520
Mama, Papa.

320
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,520
It's like the one we saw in the garden.

321
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
Mama, Papa.

322
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,520
Oh, my God.

323
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,520
Oh, my God.

324
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,520
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,520
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,520
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,520
My parents were still thank you for looking after me.

328
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,520
They're telling you off, aren't they?

329
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Yes, because I took a flying saucer.

330
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,520
You ask your parents to make Mama a normal size again.

331
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,520
Yes, of course.

332
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Fiddle grassy, grassy girl.

333
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Oh, well, that's more like it.

334
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,520
Oh, no. Oh, dear.

335
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,520
Oh, no. Stop. It's too much.

336
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,520
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

337
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,520
But could you try again, please?

338
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
I know.

339
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
The more of Mama there is a better one.

340
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
She's getting very large.

341
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
Very large indeed.

342
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Oh, yeah.

343
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Oh, oh, oh.

344
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,520
So, Mum and Valley hadn't really been invaded at all.

345
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,520
And the movements and the friends that found out where aliens really looked like.

346
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:12,520
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

347
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

348
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,520
They're always happy and always at play.

349
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,520
The movements are having fun day after day.

350
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
The movements.

351
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,520
The movements.

352
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,520
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

353
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

354
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,520
They're always happy and always at play.

355
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,520
The movements are having fun day after day.

356
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,520
The movements.

357
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,520
The movements.

358
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:10,520
The movements.
