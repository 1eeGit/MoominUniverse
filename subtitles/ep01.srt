1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:01,000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:31,000
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:02:01,000
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:31,000
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:03:01,000
la la la la la, la la la, la la

10
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, um...

11
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,560
At last!

12
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,920
It's spring!

13
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,200
Wake up, everyone!

14
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,040
It's spring time!

15
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, little mind, you're up!

16
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's hard to stay asleep with you yelling!

17
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I can't help it if I'm happy!

18
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So yeah, woke me!

19
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I was having a lovely dream about living in a watermelon!

20
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But it's beautiful outside!

21
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh, gee, isn't it?

22
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Is it really moving?

23
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes, it's all fresh!

24
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The flowers are out, and the sun is shining!

25
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So, I like being asleep!

26
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I can't help it if I'm happy!

27
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, I like being asleep!

28
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But it's spring!

29
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You said you wanted me to wake you as soon as spring was here!

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh, boy, did I?

31
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes, you did, little mind!

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You said you wanted to be a welcome as soon as spring was here!

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Really?

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes, you did!

35
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hmm, did I say something like that?

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You can go back to bed if you want to!

37
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Nobody's making you get up, little mind!

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No, there's really no point movement!

39
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm not sleepy anymore!

40
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Well, there you are then!

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You are then!

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Mama!

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Good spring, movement!

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Movement, mama!

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm starving! Have you got any watermelon?

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No, but there's lots of other things!

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We'll all have a nice big breakfast!

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I can hear a snuffkin!

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Wouldn't it be quicker to use the stairs?

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
More fun this way!

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Are you going home now?

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes, thanks very much for letting me spend the winter here!

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't think your sister will be back yet, though!

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll go anyway!

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Snuffkin!

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh, hello, movement!

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's really good to see you, Snuffkin!

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And you too!

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're back, Arlie!

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Aren't you having a good time?

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes, I was!

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But I didn't want to miss springtime in movement valley!

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What did you do?

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll tell you later.

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let's go wake up, Sniff, and think of something exciting to do!

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't think I'll like it!

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He's still snoring, movement!

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll do it again!

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, that's done it!

70
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Come on, Sniff! It's spring! Snuffkin's here!

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Please go away, you two!

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
We're going to do something really exciting!

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Like what, moment?

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I can think of more exciting things to do than this!

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, let's imagine that we're the first ever to climb this mountain!

76
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's such a clear day!

77
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We'll be able to see all of movement valley when we get to the top and the sea!

78
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Good morning, Mr. Emulets!

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Morning, moment!

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Are your father and mother up?

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes!

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Mama was when I came out!

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll never understand how you can sleep for months on end!

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why do they always have to do something exciting?

85
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What a gorgeous view!

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It really is!

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hey, look!

88
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
They're small coming from moment house!

89
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We should have stayed at home!

90
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
My bet, moment, mama's cooking something good!

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Look!

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What is it?

93
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We're not the first here after all!

94
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Look over there!

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
A top hat!

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hmm, a rather large one!

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I wonder who's had it is!

98
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hmm, I don't know, but I know papa would like it!

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hmm, it's much too big!

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Look!

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh dear, what's that?

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, I can really get inside it!

103
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You see, I cover it for my old one!

104
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Oh, I can't moment it!

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Stuck, moment!

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No, that's enough nonsense!

107
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I think I'll take it off now!

108
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What's the matter?

109
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I can't move it! It's stuck, moment!

110
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll give you a hand!

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh, that's better!

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Thank you!

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What's all this noise?

114
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Papa's head got stuck in the hat, mama!

115
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, yes, and where did that come from?

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh, moment, mama!

117
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The children found it when they were out and brought it back for me!

118
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's very smart!

119
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What shall we do with it, papa?

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
There is something strange about it!

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Shall I throw it away then?

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh no!

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's too good for that!

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Do we know anyone with a very big head?

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No, move in, papa!

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I know what we can do with it!

127
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Ah!

128
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's a...

129
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
A waste paper basket, move a mama!

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's right! Well done, Snuffkin!

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That was easy!

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Come on, Snuffkin!

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Come and have some breakfast with us!

134
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Thank you!

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Mmm, beautiful!

136
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes!

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Sorry to disturb you, but I'm going to see a moment!

138
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Uh-huh!

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Do you want to come with me, Snork?

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Uh-huh!

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Or would you rather stay here?

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Uh-huh!

143
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Well, are you coming or not?

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Uh-huh!

145
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Snork!

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Well, you know my flying ship is almost finished!

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It'll be ready this year!

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You'll see!

149
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Whoa!

150
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh, dear!

151
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Perhaps it needs a little more work!

152
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I wonder if you really can make a flying ship!

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Don't be silly, of course you can't!

154
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
A little, my Snorks always dreamed about doing it!

155
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Dreams are all right!

156
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yes, as long as they're not impossible!

157
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I suppose so!

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Mmm!

159
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Snuff, you're not still feeding your face, are you?

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Do you ever dream, Snuff?

161
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Only nightmares about having no food at all, little my!

162
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Mmm, I wonder who dropped this!

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Now where can I put it?

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh!

165
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There you are!

166
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Just the thing!

167
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh!

168
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh!

169
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Wow!

170
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Golly, what are they?

171
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
They're clouds!

172
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Be careful!

173
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Don't touch it! It might be poisonous!

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It feels like cotton!

175
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, ee!

176
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is great! I'm floating!

177
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Wonderful!

178
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Can I try?

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Are you ready, Snork Maiden?

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Here we go!

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah!

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What if you go too high?

183
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
My phone!

184
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Wait for me!

185
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Hey, wait for me!

186
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Whoa!

187
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Whoa!

188
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Hey, wait for me!

189
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Let me get on!

190
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Hey!

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Help! I'm falling!

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Moomin Papa is in his study trying to write his memoirs.

193
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
A lot has happened to him over the years.

194
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
An awful lot.

195
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And he's trying to remember it.

196
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Huh?

197
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What was that?

198
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Moomin!

199
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Hi, Papa!

200
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What are you doing out there?

201
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We're flying!

202
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The clouds just came out of the house!

203
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah, try and get nearer so I can reach you!

204
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh!

205
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
No, I'm alright!

206
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Why don't you come for a ride?

207
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Stop! Wait a minute!

208
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's great!

209
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You feel it!

210
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's great! You feel like a bird!

211
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Moomin!

212
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh!

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Come on, Papa! Jump or you'll fall!

214
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I hate it!

215
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Moomin! Mama! Quickly!

216
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What's the matter?

217
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Have you seen what the children are doing?

218
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes!

219
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Look at them! They're flying about on clouds!

220
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It can't be safe!

221
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Papa, it's alright!

222
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I told them to be careful!

223
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Come on, snappy!

224
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Come on!

225
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I won! I won!

226
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Whoa!

227
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Hey, wait a minute, little cloud!

228
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Wait for me! Don't go away!

229
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Oh, I got you!

230
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That is tree cotton!

231
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm going to climb right up here!

232
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And I'm going to get you right there!

233
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm going to take you with me!

234
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Hey, come on! You just keep coming back!

235
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yeah, I got you now!

236
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You are going to get away from me!

237
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Here I go! Come on!

238
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
All of that ledge!

239
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Stop!

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh, boy! What's happening?

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
My cloud's starting to go!

242
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, whoa, whoa! That was fun!

243
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah, it was, but I wasn't ready to stop!

244
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Look, there's movement in Snork Maiden!

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Hey!

246
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Why have they still got clouds snuffed in?

247
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
There's a starting to go as well!

248
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I think they'd better get off!

249
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Hey!

250
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Right, I'll start counting!

251
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
One, two, three!

252
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Do you want something little more?

253
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes! A place to hide!

254
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Five!

255
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Six!

256
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Seven!

257
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Boy, I don't think there's any place to hide, and here is there!

258
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Nine!

259
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, it's too dirty in here!

260
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh, it's too dirty in here!

261
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh, it's too dirty in here!

262
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Nine!

263
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh, it's too dirty in there!

264
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Nine and a half!

265
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I know! I'll hide in the head!

266
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
One, two, one, two, one!

267
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Huh?

268
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Huh?

269
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Huh?

270
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Huh?

271
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Huh?

272
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Huh?

273
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Gotcha!

274
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Huh?

275
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Huh?

276
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Huh?

277
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Snort made, huh?

278
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Boom!

279
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Boom!

280
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Moomin must be around here somewhere!

281
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Well, last time I saw him, he was hiding in the fireplace!

282
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Have you found him yet?

283
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
No!

284
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Have you looked in the cellar?

285
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yes, I have!

286
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Wait a minute, did you hear someone laughing?

287
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Where'd it come from?

288
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Chi, I better go home!

289
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh, is there anything wrong?

290
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes, I can't find Moomin anywhere!

291
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Well, he's too fat to be most places!

292
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Hahaha!

293
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
He's coming from under the hat!

294
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Well, here I am, sniff!

295
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh, on earth are you!

296
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Hahaha!

297
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I one land didn't I?

298
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You looked everywhere in the house,

299
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and you couldn't find me, could you?

300
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So I won!

301
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Who'd want to find you anyway?

302
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Well, you were trying hard enough, weren't you?

303
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What is this, a new game?

304
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
My name's Snork Maiden!

305
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What's yours?

306
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm the King of Moomin Valley!

307
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
My pretty one!

308
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You're too ugly to be the King of anything!

309
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Well, now!

310
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's not a very nice thing to say to your friend!

311
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Is it Papa?

312
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Now you'd better tell me what you have done with Moomin, huh?

313
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But I'm here!

314
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Where?

315
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Are you? And where is Moomin?

316
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Oh...

317
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Papa!

318
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm certainly not your Papa!

319
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yes you are! Come on! I'm Moomin!

320
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't know who you are!

321
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But you're not Moomin!

322
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He's nice and handsome and nothing like you!

323
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Have you looked at yourself in a mirror?

324
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Ah!

325
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Where's my nose gone?

326
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, there's nothing there anymore!

327
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh no! My tail's all pushed!

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Ah!

329
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh!

330
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
This is terrible!

331
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh!

332
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Who are you?

333
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What have you done with me?

334
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It must be a nightmare!

335
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I want to come back!

336
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Go away, you're horrible!

337
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Dear me, what's all this noise?

338
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What's happened?

339
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Mama!

340
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Mama!

341
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What earth is this?

342
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
He says he's Moomin, but just look at him!

343
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You don't look like I'm Moomin!

344
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I am!

345
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Please believe me, Mama!

346
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I am Moomin!

347
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Well, I don't know. I'm sure!

348
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Something's happened to me!

349
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Why do I look so different?

350
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Now then calm down!

351
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
This won't help at all!

352
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We don't need all this noise!

353
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
If you really are Moomin,

354
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
then everything will be alright!

355
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Just give me a minute or two and I'll know!

356
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Mama, call me Moomin!

357
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Please!

358
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't know what's happened, but I am me!

359
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Honestly, I am!

360
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Mama, please believe me!

361
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I am Moomin!

362
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Oh, Mama, you do know it's me!

363
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You must!

364
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You can't forget your little Moomin!

365
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Please, Mama! Please, Mama!

366
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Hush now, hush now!

367
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Mama!

368
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Shh!

369
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yes, you're my little Moomin alright!

370
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh, Mama!

371
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Oh!

372
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh, Moomin!

373
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Papa!

374
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Oh, Moomin, my boy!

375
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Where were you hiding?

376
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
In there!

377
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
In the hat?

378
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Let's hope it's the last we'll see of it.

379
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Moomin Papa decided that although it was a fine hat,

380
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
it was too dangerous to keep.

381
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So Moomin threw it in the river and it floated away.

382
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
He wasn't too sure about it though,

383
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
because it was a rather special hat.

384
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
They loved the laughter and they loved the living,

385
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
the Moomin's.

386
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

387
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
They're always happy and always at play.

388
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The Moomin's are having fun day after day,

389
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
the Moomin's.

390
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
They loved the laughter and they loved the living,

391
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
the Moomin's.

392
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

393
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
They're always happy and always at play.

394
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The Moomin's are having fun day after day,

395
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
the Moomin's.

396
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
The Moomin's.

397
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The Moomin's.
