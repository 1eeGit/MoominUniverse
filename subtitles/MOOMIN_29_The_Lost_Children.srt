1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There were the movements, there were the movements,

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:59,000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Woman and snorkemaiden were still fast asleep in the row and tree.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The sun was high in the sky and the floating theater had floated away a long time ago.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, oh, oh, I feel so good, I really slept like a log all night.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's so lovely to be out in the fresh air with movement and a tree in blue.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No, no, the house is gone, I mean the theater is gone.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Woman, wake up, there's been a catastrophe, wake up.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What's a catastrophe? Look down, the theaters floated off during the night.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't believe it.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It has, it's gone, I can't see it anywhere.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It must be far away by now.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Woman, your father's walking stick.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It must have got loose in the middle of the night while everybody was asleep.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Crying won't solve the problems, don't made him.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But we're stranded in the row and tree with water all around us.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hmm.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Huh?

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Huh?

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh no, we're in a drift, we're floating away!

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We're drifting away!

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, what are we going to do?

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,020
Bull men and snot maintenance are still up in that beautiful Rowan tree. That's just typical

29
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,000
Where is it and how can we have drifted so far away?

30
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,200
Listen last night didn't you I told you never to do that in the iterate brings bad look

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh! Little Maya!

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh my God!

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, no!

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh, no!

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, dear!

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh, little Maya!

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, get this hurry!

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're so mean!

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Little Maya's drifting off.

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Seems we're stranded, and that's not a bad thing.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The aiders shouldn't swim about like that.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Aren't you scared to get over to your side?

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You must be brave, North Maiden!

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll catch you so you won't fall, okay?

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh!

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I told you so, the branch didn't break, did it?

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Thank you for saving me!

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Whoa!

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Ah!

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Ah!

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Are you all right, Moomin?

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can stand up, Snorke Maiden!

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Look, the water's only ankle deep!

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Really?

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Ah!

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Are you all right, Snorke Maiden?

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes, it's so shallow.

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Wonder where I'm gonna end up.

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Doesn't matter, I rather like this boat.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm gonna make some noise.

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll go back to sleep for a while.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's getting dark, isn't it?

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh?

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes, try them!

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Look there!

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A fire!

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Must be people over there.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes!

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Of course I forgotten tonight's mid-summer eve!

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What a strange catch!

71
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So the Moomin's split up.

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Are they in trouble, little Mai?

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, seems I was probably the luckiest one as usual.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
More!

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry you can't have anymore, that's all I have.

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't believe you, your bag's still full.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yes, but not with food, little Mai.

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What's in it then?

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You'll soon find out.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Where are we going?

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
To a park.

82
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I hope there's a hot dog stand there.

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Those two over there are the park keeper and his wife.

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Look, they're always watching.

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
They guard a lot of poor orphans who come to the park every day.

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Really?

87
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Look over there!

88
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Unbelievable!

89
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hey, what's this?

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hey kids!

91
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Come on everybody, we're here to let you out!

92
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Come quickly, hurry!

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Huh?

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We can't go anywhere.

95
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We have to sit right here so they can see us.

96
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, otherwise they might lose one of us.

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What a lot of signs, no walking on grass, no shouting, no running!

98
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What a lot of rules!

99
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why are they good for a snuffkin?

100
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Nothing.

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Nothing at all.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And that's why we're going to pull them up.

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No, you mustn't.

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't think one is allowed to do that.

105
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And you have to walk on the grass.

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes indeed.

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And I really like walking on the grass.

108
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I always have.

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
No buts.

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Come on everybody, let's make a start.

111
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That looks like fun, I'll pull some too.

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What are you doing?

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Can't you read?

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
There's a sign saying it's forbidden to pull a charge.

115
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This one?

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah!

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh, oh, oh!

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh!

119
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh!

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Oh!

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh!

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh!

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Oh!

124
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh!

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh!

126
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh!

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm beautiful sign!

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh!

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Bye bye!

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh!

131
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh!

132
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh!

133
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
There you free!

134
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Go run!

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay!

136
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Stop!

137
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Wait!

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh!

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What the hell?

140
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh!

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
My goodness!

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Those little balls are shining!

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh!

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh!

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh!

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh!

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh!

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh!

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Quick ride, those were hadipatmosies!

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Come on everybody, run!

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh, you got all of here!

152
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Someone help!

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Someone help!

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The rest of me!

155
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Get some!

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Get away!

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Quick!

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They're terrible!

159
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Where could that floating theater have gone?

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
They're still following us!

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Come on, you kids, you can go wherever you want!

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Do what you like!

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, but I don't know what I want!

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Me, me, sir!

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No, me!

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I think they want to go with you, Snuffkin!

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But I don't know anything about small children.

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm not sure I even like them!

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
All we have to do is find a theater!

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Mum and Mama will know what to do!

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
In that case, let's go!

172
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Mum!

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Mum!

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Mum!

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Mum!

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Mum!

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Mum!

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Mum!

179
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh, house!

180
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes, and look!

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
All the lights are on!

182
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Maybe they're celebrating with some relief!

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Shall we go there?

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes!

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, house!

186
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes, and look!

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
All the lights are on!

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Maybe they're celebrating with some relief!

189
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Shall we go there?

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yes!

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh!

192
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh!

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh!

194
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
At last!

195
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh!

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Hello, happy midsummer!

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Thank you!

198
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Happy midsummer!

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What can I do for you?

200
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Would you have seen a theater drifting around somewhere, ma'am?

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
A theater?

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes, you see it drifted away in the flood, and my powers are on it!

203
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh, dear!

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I haven't seen anything like that!

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, what a pity!

206
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Thank you!

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We'll look elsewhere!

208
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Have a nice midsummer party!

209
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Party?

210
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, yes, a party!

211
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Thank you very much!

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Very well, then!

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll say goodnight!

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Did we say something wrong, ma'am?

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't know!

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What's the matter?

217
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I think she's crying!

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh!

219
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Hello!

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Is there anything we can do, anything at all?

221
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Aren't you having a party, ma'am?

222
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
No, unfortunately, she's not coming this year either!

223
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, is she?

224
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
My aunt and my father's side!

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I invite her every year for a midsummer party, but she never comes!

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
How sad!

227
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You must be very fond of her!

228
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, no! She's an awful person!

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If that's how you feel about her, why don't you invite someone else?

230
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
She's my only relative!

231
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So invite someone who isn't a relative?

232
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes!

233
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why don't you invite us, for instance?

234
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Oh!

235
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Can one really do things like that?

236
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Just like that?

237
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Of course one can!

238
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, marvelous!

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't be perfectly honest!

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We're very hungry!

241
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I've made lots of extra pancakes!

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Please, come in and join me!

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Thank you!

244
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Although we have drifted apart tonight, is midsummer's eve?

245
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Let's drink a toast to Mum and Snork Maiden and Little Mai

246
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and hope that they're safe!

247
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And we better drink to that no-good niece of mine, I guess!

248
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Who's that, Emma?

249
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
My only relative!

250
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
She lives all alone in a small house by the sea!

251
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Oh, is she all alone for midsummer?

252
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Probably! I always invite me over for pancakes!

253
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't like relatives, and I don't like pancakes, and she's boring, so I don't go!

254
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, let's toast her anyway, and here's hoping we'll all be together again very soon!

255
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Cheers!

256
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Good health!

257
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh, that was really good!

258
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Everything was delicious!

259
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I think I've eaten too much!

260
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh, please have some more!

261
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, this is so nice!

262
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I couldn't eat another thing!

263
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh, sad!

264
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's such fun having someone to cook for!

265
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm so pleased you're not at my door!

266
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
All that's missing now is a bonfire!

267
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We always have one on midsummer eve!

268
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What a good idea! Let's have one!

269
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Over there!

270
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Help! Help!

271
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!

272
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So glad you came!

273
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
See these? The flood brought all of them!

274
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
They were lying all over the place, so I tied them into one big pile!

275
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Would they make a good bonfire?

276
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, a terrific one!

277
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Definitely!

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh, wow!

279
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We've walked for miles, but I can't see signs of a theater anywhere!

280
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, don't worry! We'll find it soon!

281
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Huh?

282
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And what's the matter with you?

283
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm hungry!

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Me too!

285
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And me!

286
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I can't walk anymore!

287
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We don't have any food if you want food!

288
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You'll have to look for it yourself!

289
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh, don't cry!

290
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Look over there, little lion!

291
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What?

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Over there, hidden behind the trees!

293
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Whoa, I have!

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And the lights are on!

295
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We're safe!

296
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh, look at that!

297
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Hey, kids, you can't go eating other people's food!

298
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You can if they are home, and it's just what's left over from a party?

299
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
In fact, I will have some myself!

300
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's amazing! I'm always so lucky!

301
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Now we must pick nine flowers!

302
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Why is that Snorke-Middon?

303
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I don't really know!

304
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's always nine or seven of something!

305
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Okay, nine flowers!

306
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
No, not the same kind!

307
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You must pick nine different flowers!

308
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
A memory you do!

309
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You turn around, and then you turn around!

310
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And then you turn around!

311
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And then you turn around!

312
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And then you turn around!

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And then you turn around!

314
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And then you turn around!

315
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You turn around seven times like this!

316
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I get it!

317
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And then you walk backward until you reach a well!

318
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And then, when you look down into the well,

319
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
there you'll see the man you're going to marry!

320
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
How did I get him up?

321
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I think I see him! What a clever well!

322
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That I must try!

323
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'd like someone more romantic!

324
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Got you!

325
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What are you doing?

326
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm quietly now!

327
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Oh, all we did is pick some unprotected wild flowers!

328
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I know what you did!

329
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Hey, Snorke-Middon!

330
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Moonman!

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Ha! You know each other! That makes it conspiracy!

332
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But I tell you, we've done nothing wrong, nothing at all!

333
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We were only celebrating!

334
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Better for you, if you haven't!

335
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But why? Can't you light a bonfire here, sir?

336
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I must warn you that all you say will be used against you!

337
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I have a complaint from the parkkeeper!

338
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You pulled up these signs from his park and you burnt them!

339
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's not true!

340
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It is true that we burnt them, sir,

341
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
but we didn't take them from any park!

342
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
They were brought here by the flood!

343
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Older-dash! Here's the evidence!

344
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I've caught you when that's that!

345
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh, I caught something!

346
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh, it's just a piece of wood!

347
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Had any ideas here?

348
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Not a single one. How about you, Mama?

349
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Same here, I'm afraid.

350
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I just can't seem to think of anything at all!

351
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You wouldn't have any ideas about what we should do next, would you, Emma?

352
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
About what?

353
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Some ideas about how to let the children know where we are, of course.

354
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
How does anyone?

355
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
No where a theater is.

356
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I don't know.

357
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Please tell us.

358
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Well, you put on a play.

359
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
A play?

360
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes, that is correct.

361
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
This is a theater, and when you put on a new play,

362
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
everybody comes walking to see it.

363
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
They come to laugh, to cry, to shout, and to applaud.

364
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And when your children hear of it, they will be hearing a flash.

365
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What a splendid idea, Emma!

366
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's exactly what we'll do.

367
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm sorry, we can't put on a play.

368
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Why not?

369
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We have no actors. They are pests, but one can't do without them.

370
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I can be one.

371
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And I'm also quite good at acting.

372
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I can act very well.

373
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
There are only three of you, and not one of you, is an experienced professional actor.

374
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Don't forget, we have you, Emma.

375
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Me?

376
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Well, I've always felt that I would make a rather good Shakespearean heroine.

377
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And we can each have many parts, as long as they're not all on the stage at the same time.

378
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
He isn't at so moment, Papa.

379
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Of course, it's possible to do it.

380
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I want the part that finds the treasure.

381
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
No, that's impossible. We have no play.

382
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Nothing simple enough for the likes of you.

383
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
A moment, Papa, can write one. He's very talented.

384
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
No trouble at all, my dear. Any number of acts.

385
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But we don't want any number. We want three acts.

386
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That's what all proper plays always have, moment, Papa.

387
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Let's start right away.

388
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
We got to print posters.

389
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And clean the stage.

390
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Whatever, if I started.

391
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Aw.

392
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And this was how a woman, Papa, got started on a short career as a playwright.

393
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But while the birds carry news of the play far and wide,

394
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
what has to become of movement and snorkemaiden?

395
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Their troubles are real ones.

396
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:38,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

397
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,000
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

398
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
They're always happy and goes at play.

399
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

400
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The movements.

401
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The movements.

402
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The movements.

403
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
The movements.
