1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
here they are for one and all the moments are about to come on and sit down here with

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,840
me here for you on your TV they are the moments they are the moments so come

3
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,680
with me give me your hand I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,040
like a bird sing that song ever there were the moments there were the

5
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:58,880
moments there were the moments there was the moments

6
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:28,880
Ba da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

8
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Mama! Mama!

9
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
Are they ready?

10
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
Are what ready?

11
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,880
The pancakes!

12
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
Not yet.

13
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,880
This hobgoblin wood doesn't seem to burn very well.

14
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,880
Aren't they cooking?

15
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
They won't be long.

16
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
Have some lemonade while you're waiting.

17
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
Mama!

18
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,880
Are the pancakes ready yet?

19
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
Oh well.

20
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Everything seems normal in the movement house.

21
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
Oh!

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,880
I'm a dumbo.

23
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,880
I'm a no-good, mean, good-boot, Ninny.

24
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,880
No, you're not, Snork.

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
You're very clever.

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,880
I'm a failure of flop of frightful fraud and a misfit.

27
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880
But your landship was a success?

28
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,880
Wasn't it?

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
Kid stuff!

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,880
Look, if you can make a ship that runs on land,

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,880
then I'm sure you can make one that flies.

32
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,880
I believe in you.

33
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,880
Fatal out of good, that does me snort and maiden.

34
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,880
You know, last night, I thought,

35
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,880
I've done it, a flagship, then I looked at it again.

36
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
No good, no good.

37
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
It was all wrong.

38
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Wouldn't, couldn't fly at all.

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,880
Oh, how can someone so intelligent be such an idiot?

40
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
Oh dear, oh dear.

41
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Well, they're ready.

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,880
Go and tell the others, little Mai.

43
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,880
All right, move in, Mama.

44
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,880
Where's Moomin and Snork Maiden?

45
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Snork Maiden's fallen again.

46
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,880
Come on, Snork Maiden, cheer up.

47
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,880
I'm sure Snork will get over it.

48
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,880
Inventors always feel down in the dumps when something doesn't work.

49
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Does Moomin, Papa, do you think?

50
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,880
He invents stories, doesn't he, Moomin?

51
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Well, where Moomin was, really?

52
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Snork Maiden, do you want some pancakes?

53
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Oh, yes, please, Moomin, Mama.

54
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,880
Moomin, go and get Papa.

55
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,880
I have a feeling he's writing his gut stuck again.

56
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,880
Okay, Mama.

57
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
Now, what's the matter, Snork Maiden?

58
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
Hmm.

59
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Well, the sun returned to the eastern sky when morning came

60
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
and everything started to get lighter and louder.

61
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Oh dear, everybody knows that.

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Even the stupidest retard of Rayleigh.

63
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,880
I have absolutely no literary talent.

64
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,880
I'm an ignoramus son, a literate dilatant, nor an illiterate idiot.

65
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,880
It's high time I gave up writing, though.

66
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
Yes?

67
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
Papa?

68
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,880
Yeah, what is it, Moomin?

69
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,880
Uh, Mama said to tell you the pancakes are ready.

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,880
Well, I can't stop now, I'm being creative.

71
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
I'll eat later.

72
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
Oh, really?

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Yes, anything else?

74
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,880
Yeah, no, I thought you said something.

75
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,880
Moomin, wait, I'm coming.

76
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,880
That was really good, Moomin, Mama.

77
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
I'm going out.

78
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,880
I'm coming!

79
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
No, you can't.

80
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,880
Snuffkin and I are going on an adventure and it could be dangerous.

81
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Hi, Snuffkin!

82
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Hello, Moomin.

83
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
Didn't think you were coming.

84
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
Sorry, I'm late.

85
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
What's that?

86
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
A leaf boat.

87
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,880
Look, it sails on the river just like a real one.

88
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,880
I bet it goes all the way down to the sea.

89
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
And maybe even to some foreign lands.

90
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Gosh, Snuffkin, I'd like to do that one day.

91
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Let's go then, shall we?

92
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Little Mai wanted to come, but I told her it was too dangerous.

93
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,880
Hmm, perhaps that wasn't the best thing to say.

94
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
Look!

95
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Where are you?

96
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
Where are you?

97
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,880
I brought these to you, Moomin.

98
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,880
I thought they could use a bit of fun.

99
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
I'm going out.

100
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Wait, where are you?

101
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
I brought these to you, Moomin.

102
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
I thought they could use a bit of fun.

103
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
Wait, Moomin!

104
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Are we really going to climb up there?

105
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Look, I don't think we can all go.

106
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
It'll just be Moomin and me.

107
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,880
I'm not climbing up there.

108
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
Well, I am.

109
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Wouldn't you like to keep me company instead?

110
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,880
Look, there's a cave just a little bit further along this path.

111
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,880
Why don't you two girls wait for us there?

112
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
We won't be long.

113
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,880
But if you can walk to it, why on earth climb to it?

114
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,880
Ah, difficult for a girl to understand.

115
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,880
Well, I think boys are difficult to understand.

116
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
We're not sure we can reach it from above.

117
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
Well, we'll soon find out.

118
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
Are you coming with us, Snuff?

119
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Oh, I think I'll guard the rear.

120
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Protect the cave from below.

121
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Oh, yeah.

122
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Well, someone has to look after the girls.

123
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Someone responsible.

124
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Oh, my goodness, it's dark in there.

125
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,880
Let's go in, then.

126
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
I don't like the look of it.

127
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,880
We'd better stay out here.

128
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,880
I never know who might live in there.

129
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Don't be silly.

130
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
No one lives in there.

131
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,880
That's what I don't like.

132
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Yes, exactly a place with no one living in it is really scary.

133
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,880
I think we must be right above the cave here.

134
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
Maybe.

135
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
I can't find the hole, though.

136
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,880
Let's look a bit more over that way, moving.

137
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,880
Wow, I've never seen a shell like this before.

138
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,880
Oh, look at that one.

139
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
They must be worth a fortune.

140
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,880
Come over here and look, little mind.

141
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,880
Where's little mind, Snork Maiden?

142
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
She went into the cave, Snuff.

143
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,880
Oh, no, she can't do that.

144
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,880
It might be dangerous.

145
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Little mind, little mind, come out.

146
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
No, you come in, scaredy cat.

147
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,880
You can't just go in like that.

148
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
You can't.

149
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,880
So tell me, how would you go in there and Mr. Knove at all?

150
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,880
Stay where you are.

151
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
We'll rescue you.

152
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,880
You're coming, too, aren't you, Snork Maiden?

153
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,880
You can't stay here alone.

154
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
I suppose so.

155
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,880
Right then, let's go.

156
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,880
Shall I hold your hand in case you get frightened?

157
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,880
Little mind, where are you?

158
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,880
Stop it, please.

159
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,880
You're frightening Snork Maiden.

160
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,880
Oh, really?

161
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,880
I thought I was frightening you.

162
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,880
Your voice is so shaky.

163
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,880
This isn't the way I sound normally.

164
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
Hey, be quiet.

165
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
No.

166
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
I can hear something.

167
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Me, too.

168
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
Perhaps it's the wind.

169
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
No, Snork Maiden.

170
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,880
It sounds like someone moaning.

171
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,880
You can't scare me like that.

172
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
No one lives here.

173
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Who want to live here anyway?

174
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,880
It's dark and cold.

175
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,880
It's moment and snuffkin.

176
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,880
They've climbed out and we can hear their voices in the distance.

177
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
So we needn't worry.

178
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Why would they be moaning?

179
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
No, it's not them.

180
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,880
I'm gonna go and investigate.

181
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Don't, little mind.

182
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Please, please stop it.

183
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
Pull hard, Moomin.

184
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,880
Will this do?

185
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Right, who's going first?

186
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Me.

187
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Okay, but please be careful.

188
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
I will.

189
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,880
Take it easy, Moomin.

190
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
There's no hurry.

191
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Hey, are you alright, Moomin?

192
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
Yes, of course.

193
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Moomin.

194
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Help me!

195
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,880
Moomin, what's happened?

196
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,880
Talk to me.

197
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
Moomin, are you alright?

198
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
Oh, I don't know.

199
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
I think so.

200
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
My bottom's a little bit sore, though.

201
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,880
I'm sure I heard somebody scream just now.

202
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Well, the Himmelin was down here, having a nap.

203
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
The Himmelin?

204
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,880
If this is another of your games, Moomin, I don't like it.

205
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Mr. Himmelin, we were climbing down from the top.

206
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,880
We didn't know you were asleep.

207
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
That's not quite right.

208
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
I wasn't asleep.

209
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
I wasn't at all comfortable, you know.

210
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,880
Well, what were you doing here, then?

211
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Well, to tell you the truth, I really haven't been quite myself lately.

212
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,880
You haven't lost any more rare stamps, have you, Mr. Himmelin?

213
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
I'm a contrary, Moomin.

214
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
I have them all.

215
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,880
Even the rarest, every single one.

216
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Then, what's wrong?

217
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
That's good, isn't it?

218
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,880
I mean, my collection is complete.

219
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,880
I know one in the world has a better stamp collection than you have, Mr. Himmelin.

220
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
No, of course not mine is perfect.

221
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
There isn't a stamp I haven't got.

222
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,880
Rare ones, old ones, misprinted ones, I have them all.

223
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,880
I still don't understand.

224
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,880
There's no challenge, nothing to search for.

225
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,880
You're too young and you don't collect stamps.

226
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,880
Oh dear, me, dear me.

227
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
I'm beginning to understand.

228
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
He's not a collector anymore.

229
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
He's got all the stamps he could ever want.

230
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,880
That's the trouble.

231
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,880
It's not half as much fun.

232
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,880
That's why you're sad, isn't it, Mr. Himmelin?

233
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Yes, it is. No fun.

234
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
No fun at all.

235
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
No, I understand.

236
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,880
I can see why you're upset.

237
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,880
And me falling on top of you like that didn't really help, did it?

238
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,880
Not exactly, Moomin.

239
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Look who was taking a nap in the cave.

240
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Oh, it's you, Mr. Himmelin.

241
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
So it must have been his snoring that we heard.

242
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
What a noise he was making.

243
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,880
I'd never ever snore.

244
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,880
You certainly do.

245
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Robbys, look, if you promise not to tell anyone

246
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,880
I'll take you to see something very special.

247
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
What is it?

248
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Oh, it's him!

249
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
He's in a home!

250
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
He's in a home!

251
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
He's in a home!

252
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
He's in a home!

253
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
He's in a home!

254
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
He's in a home!

255
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
He's in a home!

256
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
He's in a home!

257
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
He's in a home!

258
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
I think he could be repaired.

259
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
Of course it could.

260
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Easy!

261
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
But you know you can't always tell.

262
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,880
The keel doesn't look too good.

263
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Yes, we could take it out to see a no-time.

264
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
The sails got holes in it.

265
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Hey, I can't find any owners.

266
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,880
You can paddle all-steer.

267
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,880
Look out, friends! It's going over!

268
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Hey!

269
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
Hang on, everybody.

270
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,880
I've lost my confidence and it makes me feel very unhappy.

271
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Well, it can happen to anyone, you know.

272
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Even to you?

273
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Well, not much, of course.

274
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,880
Lucky you. I just don't know what to do.

275
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,880
How can I get it back? There must be a way.

276
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,880
It's hard to say.

277
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Everybody's different, but with me, it just happens.

278
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,880
I don't think I'll ever invent anything again.

279
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Perhaps I'll have a break from my memoirs, too.

280
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Tea time?

281
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Oh, dear. What's the matter with you, too?

282
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
You look a bit down in the dumps.

283
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,880
You know I might have been a bit overconfident.

284
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Me, too, I think.

285
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
Oh, hi there!

286
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Mum and Mama!

287
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Mum and Papa!

288
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
There's no need to yell.

289
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,880
We can hear you. Watch the matter, Sniff.

290
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,880
We found a boat on the beach. Come and have a look.

291
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
A shipwreck washed up on the shore.

292
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,880
It's not a wreck, and it's got a white sail.

293
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
Oh.

294
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,880
We're going to repair it, and then it'll be ours.

295
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
All right, I'm coming.

296
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,880
Come on, Snort. Let's take a look at this boat.

297
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
It could be just the thing to cheer us both up.

298
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,880
So, it's got a sail. A white sail, you say.

299
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
That could be extremely interesting.

300
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,880
It's a sturdy little craft. It's nicely built.

301
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Well designed.

302
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,880
She's abandoned. So does that mean we can keep her?

303
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,880
It seems to be in pretty good condition except for the hole in the bottom.

304
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,880
You know, maybe that's why she was abandoned here.

305
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
You could be right, Sniffkin.

306
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Finders keepers, you guys. Of course it makes it our boat.

307
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,880
You'd have to wait to see if anyone claims it first, little mind.

308
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
What shall we do then, Papa?

309
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Well, first things first, we must repair the hole,

310
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,880
and then tire up securely in case there's a storm.

311
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Absolutely.

312
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,880
Then if the owner comes, we ought to give her back to him.

313
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Mind you, she might know she's here.

314
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,880
So, what are we going to do when we've repaired her?

315
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,880
It's bad for boats not to be yours, but we could sail the seven seas.

316
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
Yay!

317
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,880
I'd be happy just to explore around here.

318
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Don't worry, Snort Maiden.

319
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,880
If we get big waves, we can sail between them, isn't that right, Mum and Papa?

320
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,880
Well, in a way. Come on, let's get to work.

321
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,880
How about you, Snort? Will you help us?

322
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
Yes, of course.

323
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Can I do anything for you, Mum and Papa?

324
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Yes, if you'd like to, Mr. Himmelon.

325
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,880
Well, I'm afraid I'm not much of a builder, but if there is something I could do.

326
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,880
Well, let's get her out of the water first, shall we?

327
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
Yes, Mum!

328
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,880
And we'll need some big logs to go under her.

329
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
I think ten should be enough.

330
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,880
I'll be ten some. Let's go, prom!

331
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Yes, you'll need to be safe to work on, so we'll want something strong to keep her upright as well.

332
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,880
And lots of tools.

333
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,880
I'll go home and get some, and I think we'll need a bucket and a shovel.

334
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,880
I'll come with you and help you choose.

335
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,880
Yes, you go. I'll stay and keep guard in case the owner comes back.

336
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Sleep well.

337
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Man, the top sales.

338
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,880
What?

339
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Are they all in bed, my dear?

340
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Yes, dear. Sleeping like logs.

341
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,880
I'm not surprised. They all work very, very hard today.

342
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,880
I can't wait until the boat's ready, and we can sail off somewhere.

343
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,880
My dear, we'll go anywhere in the world you like.

344
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Anywhere at all you've only got to say and off will Jolly will go.

345
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
It doesn't have to be far, dear.

346
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Let's get to bed, too. We've got an early start of the morning.

347
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Oh! Intellectuals like me aren't used to this artwork.

348
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Oh, I'm tired out, and I can hardly move.

349
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
Mama, I'd better put these tired legs to bed.

350
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Good night, dear moment, Papa. This will be good for him, I think.

351
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

352
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,880
A perfect fit, if I may say so.

353
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
Yeah, well, now for the rest of her.

354
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,880
Right.

355
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Look at me, Moomin. I'm doing the Tari.

356
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,880
I know, little Mai. I'm only doing where you can't reach.

357
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Oh, all right, then. Sniff you lazy land lover. Bring me some more Tari.

358
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,880
No, I won't. Get it yourself, you lazy thing. You wanted to do it.

359
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,880
I didn't want to carry Tari, though. And anyway, I'm the painter.

360
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,880
Come on, hurry up.

361
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Moomin, Mama, should I cut it all out?

362
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,880
Yes, please, not me.

363
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Hey, feeling all right, Mr. Hemmielin?

364
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,880
Yes, thank you. You're fixing the boat very quickly.

365
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Yeah, we sure are, should be finished very soon.

366
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Yes, I'm sure it will.

367
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,880
That's what I was afraid of. What shall I do then, Sniffkin?

368
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,880
Well, maybe you could start collecting something else. What do you think?

369
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Something else, like what?

370
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,880
Well, I don't know. Anything, really?

371
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
How about butterflies?

372
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,880
No, my second cousin does that, and he's a complete idiot.

373
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,880
It has to be something interesting. Ornumans?

374
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Ornumans?

375
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Yeah, you could collect those forever. Not scientific.

376
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,880
Well, it's up to you, but I think you really ought to collect something, Mr. Hemmielin.

377
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
Mama! Mama!

378
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Mama, quick, hurry up. We're going to launch the new boat.

379
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,880
All right, wait for me. I'm coming.

380
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,880
The sail you men had is perfect, Mama. Come on.

381
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Are you ready, everybody? I'll count to three and then push as hard as you can.

382
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,880
One, two, three!

383
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,880
And so, with their new boat finally repaired and uncleaned,

384
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,880
Moomin and the others began to get very excited about their trip from the world.

385
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,880
Even Snork and Mr. Hemmielin were in unusually high spirits.

386
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,880
All aboard for a trial run.

387
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
I've decided what I'm going to collect.

388
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Flowers, look, here's my first sample. It's a sweet fryer, Rosa Rubiconosa.

389
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,880
That's great. Good for you.

390
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Snork, maiden. I've just had a new idea for my flying ship.

391
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,880
I'm certain it'll work this time.

392
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Of course it will, Snork. Good luck.

393
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,880
I'd better get on. All right, start paddling, everyone.

394
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,880
We'll be back soon, my dear, Moomin Mama.

395
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,880
Take as long as you like, Papa. I'll prepare something cold for when you get back.

396
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,880
One, two, one, two.

397
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,880
The way, the way, the deep blue yonder.

398
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,880
One, two, one, two.

399
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:14,880
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

400
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,880
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

401
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,880
They're always happy and always at play.

402
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,880
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

403
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,880
The movements.

404
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,880
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

405
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:50,880
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

406
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,880
They're always happy and always at play.

407
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:02,880
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

408
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,880
The movements.

409
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,880
The movements.
