where have you been snuffkin that's a big secret movement I won't tell anyone

38
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,080
All right, it's the magic hat. It's on a sandbank further down the river.

39
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,120
Gosh!

40
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
But something terrible is happening.

41
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
What? What is it?

42
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,560
Oh dear, perhaps we shouldn't have thrown it in the river.

43
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
It's too late now. Let's get there cooking.

44
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:29,760
There it is. It's caught on a branch in the middle.

45
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,320
Where? Oh, Smoughkin, I can see it. Look at the water. It's all red.

46
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,400
Hmm, seems to be coming from the hat. I wonder what it is, Moong.

47
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
I'll go and get it. Be careful.

48
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,600
Shall I come too? No, you stay there.

49
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,760
Have you got it? Uh-huh.

50
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,280
Wow! It's raspberry juice.

51
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
What should we do with the hat?

52
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,400
Well, I don't think it's a good idea to leave it lying around.

53
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,240
Somebody might crawl into it.

54
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,000
But if we put water in it, we can have as much raspberry juice as we can drink.

55
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,360
Well, that would be nice. But you know, Moong, it could only be river water that does that.

56
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,400
You know what I mean, Moong?

57
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,200
Well, I think it's worth experimenting.

58
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
What's the matter, Moong? You look very tired.

59
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,320
I woke up in the night and couldn't get back to sleep.

60
00:07:48,320 --> 00:08:09,280
Ha! Pardon? Couldn't get back to sleep. Ha! What are you talking about?

61
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,520
I was awake last night too.

62
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,080
And I know why you're so tired.

63
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,440
You must have been dreaming.

64
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

65
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,080
Thanks, Mama.

66
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,120
Where are you going, Moong? Moong!

67
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,320
Somewhere you can't come. Somewhere private.

68
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,320
So, what was that all about, huh?

69
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,640
Oh, nothing really important, Moong and Papa.

70
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,960
I think I'll go out.

71
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,400
Nobody hides anything from little, my.

72
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,080
Snuffkin!

73
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,080
Hey, I found out who's had it is.

74
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,280
Who's?

75
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,880
The Hobgoblins.

76
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,080
The Hobgoblins?

77
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,880
Yeah, I asked the Hemmielin and he told me that he saw him once long ago wearing that.

78
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,280
I heard about the wizard who flies in the sky.

79
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Yeah, on the back of a black panther.

80
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,280
The Hobgoblins is hundreds of years old and cares only for rubies.

81
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,080
He rides all over the world, searching for them.

82
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
He's truly awesome.

83
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
And so, when he dropped his hat?

84
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,280
He must have been looking for some rubies right here in Moong and Valley.

85
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,080
Do you think he's got a lot of hats, Snuffkin?

86
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,280
Gee, I don't know.

87
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,280
Well, do you think perhaps he doesn't know where he dropped his hat?

88
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Yeah, I suppose that's possible.

89
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,080
Snuffkin, there's something I would like to try with the hat.

90
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Just don't put it on. Will you?

91
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,440
He's in there somewhere.

92
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,080
Hat lions are pretty stupid, you know.

93
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,880
Yes, Moong and Papa told me it takes him hours to dig themselves into the sand.

94
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,280
Oh, no, it doesn't. It only takes the one hour.

95
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
Only an hour? You're kidding.

96
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Well, of course, an hour is a long time to spend digging.

97
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
Are you talking about me?

98
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,080
Yes, about how quickly you could dig yourself into a hole in the sand.

99
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,280
A lot quicker than you think it will take.

100
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,280
Moong in here says it takes you only one hour to dig a hole in the sand,

101
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
but I can't believe that.

102
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,280
Snuffkin says it takes several hours, but I think he's wrong.

103
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,280
I'll show you how long.

104
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Gosh, that was rather fast.

105
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,280
Yeah, but it's obvious he's already got a ready-made hole hidden there.

106
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Don't you ant lion?

107
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,280
No, I do not.

108
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,280
I can dig myself in anywhere, anywhere at all.

109
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
How about here?

110
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
Yeah, okay. Under this rock.

111
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
All right?

112
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Anywhere. Just show me.

113
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Okay, start from here.

114
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Yeah, just there, if you don't mind.

115
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
All right, start counting.

116
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Dude!

117
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,280
Wow, you only took a second and a half.

118
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
He's really something, isn't he?

119
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
He certainly is.

120
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,280
I'd better sit on it.

121
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Yeah, he'll be really mad.

122
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,280
So you've caught the ant lion. I've been watching.

123
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Little boy.

124
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
Right.

125
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,280
Did you follow us last night?

126
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Yes.

127
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Oh, did you tell the others?

128
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Oh, don't be silly you guys. I haven't said a word yet.

129
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,280
But you will if we don't let you join in with us.

130
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
That's what she's doing, movement.

131
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
No, as if I do such a thing.

132
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Of course, I'm forgetting how nice and kind you are.

133
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Hey, what is that?

134
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Nope, no hat anywhere.

135
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
There's gallons of water.

136
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Gosh, there sure must be a lot of sand in there.

137
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,280
He must have changed into something else by now.

138
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Probably.

139
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,280
There must have been long enough. Oh, jump off.

140
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,280
He isn't strong enough to move the rock by himself.

141
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
Shall we help him?

142
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
No, don't.

143
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
Come on, let's do it.

144
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
What's happened to him?

145
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Let's turn it over.

146
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Oh, no, I can't look.

147
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
Oh.

148
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
It's a hedgehog.

149
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Oh, no, no, no.

150
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,280
It's a hedgehog.

151
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,280
It's a hedgehog.

152
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
Oh, no!

153
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Oh, no!

154
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Movement.

155
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Oh, stop it.

156
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
Don't push me, Lucy.

157
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
Why?

158
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
Movement.

159
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Movement.

160
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Movement, I just saw the Hobgoblin.

161
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,280
What?

162
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
It must have been him.

163
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Do you think he was looking for his hat?

164
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,280
I'm afraid so.

165
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
I hope you hit it well.

166
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
The seller.

167
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Will it be safe there?

168
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,280
Well, only little my and us two know where it is.

169
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
Hmm.

170
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
The red?

171
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,280
I wonder if it's possible to change it into spaghetti.

172
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,280
Hmm, not exactly spaghetti.

173
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
Mama.

174
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
Mama.

175
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,280
There's something I think you ought to know.

176
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,280
What is it, dear?

177
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,280
There are strange things happening in the house.

178
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
In the house?

179
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
There's a tree in the seller.

180
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
A tree?

181
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,280
That's nice.

182
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,280
What did you say, a real tree?

183
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,280
Yes, and it seems to be growing and growing.

184
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,280
What have you done, little my?

185
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Just dropped a bit of thread into the magic hat.

186
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,280
But movement threw it away.

187
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
Yeah, we did.

188
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,280
But we sort of found it again and put it in the seller.

189
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Oh, dear.

190
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,280
We must tell movement papa before it's too late.

191
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Come in.

192
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
It's not locked.

193
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Keep going, tree.

194
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
You can grow as big as you like.

195
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,280
And just tell me if you're thirsty or anything.

196
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
And how about some fruit soon?

197
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,280
I really like pears.

198
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Come in.

199
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
I'm very sorry to disturb you, papa.

200
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
What is it?

201
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,280
Well, it's not good.

202
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,280
What do you mean, not good?

203
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,280
I think you'd better come down and have a look at once.

204
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,280
So you can see for yourself what's happening before it's too late.

205
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Too late?

206
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Well, that sounds a bit ominous.

207
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Don't worry. I'll sort it out.

208
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
Whatever the catastrophe.

209
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
Now, listen you.

210
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
You leave my husband's desk alone.

211
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Or you'll be sorry.

212
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
All right, dear.

213
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
I'm coming.

214
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
Well, this is definitely a catastrophe.

215
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
I think you'd better get me a saw, Mama.

216
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Oh, what's yo?

217
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Everything's in the cellar, and it would be a bit difficult to get in there now, woman, papa.

218
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
They'll never mind. We haven't got time.

219
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
I'll break them by hand.

220
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Gee, look at moving house.

221
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Come on, Snork Maiden. This is fun.

222
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
But what happened, little Mai?

223
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
I've been gardening, that's all.

224
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
Aren't I clever?

225
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Well, this catastrophe is going on too long.

226
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,280
I'm hungry.

227
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Look on the bright side, papa.

228
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,280
It could be a long time before we run out of firewood.

229
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
There, take that.

230
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Oh, oh.

231
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,280
That'll teach you to try and take over moment house.

232
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,280
Papa, look at all these lovely flowers.

233
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
And fruit.

234
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,280
Papa, papa, you must try some.

235
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Oh, they're lovely and juicy.

236
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,280
Oh, no.

237
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,280
Little Mai must have put something into the hat.

238
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Woman, where are you, woman?

239
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Here I am.

240
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,280
Oh, woman, I was afraid that you were inside the house.

241
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Mama, papa, little Mai.

242
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
They can't get out.

243
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
We'll need some saws and axes.

244
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
We must all be in the cellar and we can't get in this way.

245
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
We must try and find another way.

246
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
All right, I'll run and get some help.

247
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
You do not have to, little one.

248
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Are you the hobgoblin, sir?

249
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
I am he.

250
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
I can see that you have found my hat.

251
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
Yes, sir.

252
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
It was on top of the mountain.

253
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
I think the...

254
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,280
That tree seems to be doing remarkably well.

255
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,280
However, away with thee.

256
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Oh, my goodness, me.

257
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Oh, my goodness.

258
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,280
That really is some hat you have there, Mr. Hobgoblin.

259
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
I'm sorry, I troubled you.

260
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,280
We're just glad you came along when you did, Mr. Hobgoblin.

261
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
You're most kind, madam.

262
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,280
I don't suppose you'd have any uncommonly large rubies here, would you?

263
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,280
You finding my hat here must be an omen.

264
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Here you are, Mr. Hobgoblin.

265
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,280
My husband, Moomin, Papa gave it to me.

266
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:58,280
It is fine indeed, and you are lucky to have it, but I'm afraid it is not the King's Ruby I am looking for.

267
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,280
What do you mean, King's Ruby?

268
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,280
I have searched for it for hundreds of years, Moomin, Mama.

269
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,280
I'm afraid I am obsessed by it and cannot find it anywhere.

270
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Well, if we see it, we'll light a signal fire.

271
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,280
You are most kind, madam, and I feel we shall meet again soon.

272
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,280
He's not bad for Hobgoblin.

273
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Come on, everybody. Let's start stacking up all this wood.

274
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Oh, King, let's do it!

275
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,280
And so the Hobgoblin's hat finally disappeared from Moomin Valley.

276
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,280
Moomin rather missed having an ever-ending supply of raspberry juice,

277
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,280
but his parents were more than happy that it had gone.

278
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:14,280
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomin's.

279
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

280
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,280
They're always happy and always at play.

281
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:32,280
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

282
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,280
The Moomin's.

283
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:44,280
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomin's.

284
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:51,280
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

285
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,280
They're always happy and always at play.

286
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:02,280
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

287
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,280
The Moomin's.

288
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:12,280
The Moomin's.
