518880,520880,"To slide on the snow with a coarse stupid.",518500,519700,"SPEAKER_04"
520880,523880,"But it's a sort of family treasure and heirloom.",519900,522300,"SPEAKER_05"
524880,527880,"Well, you never use it and it's so shiny.",522900,525100,"SPEAKER_04"
527880,530880,"It'll make a great sled and go really fast.",525500,531700,"SPEAKER_05"

592880,594880,"But it's all frozen.",586500,586500,"SPEAKER_06"
594880,597880,"So we'll be able to slide on it.",593500,594800,"SPEAKER_04"

665480,667280,"She's not a very nice lady.",661400,667000,"SPEAKER_05"
667280,668480,"That's right, Little Mayan.",661400,667000,"SPEAKER_05"
668480,670480,"Spring can never come while she's here.",667300,671800,"SPEAKER_03"

672080,673080,"Oh, I see.",667300,671800,"SPEAKER_03"
673080,677480,"And are you hoping she'll ride away on this horse, then?",672100,675800,"SPEAKER_03"
677480,683680,"Yes, and it will take her back to the north, where she stays until she comes here again next winter and drives the sun away.",672100,675800,"SPEAKER_03"
683680,687280,"The horse doesn't look very solid to me, Tiki.",677600,686700,"SPEAKER_03"
687280,693280,"Well, that's why I'm going to pour water over it when it gets really cold and then it'll be solid.",677600,686700,"SPEAKER_03"
693480,695480,"When is the lady of the cold coming?",693300,700900,"SPEAKER_03"

751680,754680,"What if the ice suddenly melts or something?",747600,754100,"SPEAKER_05"
759680,760680,"I like it here.",757600,758500,"SPEAKER_06"
760680,762080,"It's warm and cozy.",759800,764800,"SPEAKER_03"
762080,765280,"I hope Mom and Papa doesn't mind me using it.",759800,764800,"SPEAKER_03"
