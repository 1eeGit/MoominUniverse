00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:46.000 --> 00:58.000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

01:16.000 --> 01:31.220
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:37.560 --> 01:40.880
Have you ever heard of Moombin valley?

01:40.880 --> 01:50.480
In winter, deep white snow covers the whole valley, and everyone goes to sleep so that they

01:50.480 --> 01:52.480
keep warm.

01:52.480 --> 02:03.760
Look, there's a woman house.

02:03.760 --> 02:11.640
This woman, our hero,

02:11.640 --> 02:20.920
and Papa, and Mum and Mama.

02:20.920 --> 02:34.440
And this little bundle must be little my.

02:34.440 --> 02:56.160
I think before our story starts, we'd better wake everyone up with some spring sunshine.

02:56.160 --> 03:16.160
At last, it's spring.

03:16.160 --> 03:24.160
Wake up everyone, it's spring time.

03:24.160 --> 03:44.480
I can't help it if I'm happy.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.280
So yeah, woke me.

03:46.280 --> 03:51.000
I was having a lovely dream about living in a watermelon, but it's beautiful outside.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Oh gee, isn't it, is it really moving?

03:54.000 --> 04:01.360
Yes, it's all fresh, the flowers are out and the sun is shining, so I like being asleep.

04:01.360 --> 04:05.360
But it's spring, you said you wanted me to wake you as soon as spring was here.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.960
Oh boy, did I?

04:06.960 --> 04:09.160
Yes, you did little my.

04:09.160 --> 04:12.640
You said you wanted to be a welcome as soon as spring was here.

04:12.640 --> 04:13.640
Really?

04:13.640 --> 04:14.640
Yes, you did.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.000
Did I say something like that?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
You can go back to bed if you want to.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.320
Nobody's making you get up, little my.

04:22.320 --> 04:26.000
No, there's really no point, Mum, and I'm not sleepy anymore.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Well, there you are then.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Mama!

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Good spring, Mum.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.840
Mum, and Mama, I'm starving.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.560
Have you got any water, Mellon?

04:37.560 --> 04:40.560
No, but there's lots of other things.

04:40.560 --> 04:47.560
You'll all have a nice, big breakfast.

04:47.560 --> 04:54.560
I can hear a snuff gun.

05:04.560 --> 05:09.560
Wouldn't it be quicker to use the stairs?

05:09.560 --> 05:11.560
More fun this way.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.560
Are you going home now?

05:13.560 --> 05:18.560
Yes, thanks very much for letting me spend the winter here.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.560
Don't think your sister will be back yet, though.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.560
I'll go anyway.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.560
Snuff gun!

05:31.560 --> 05:33.560
Oh, hello, Mum.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.560
It's really good to see you, Snuffkin.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.560
And you too.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.560
Jack Arley, weren't you having a good time?

05:39.560 --> 05:41.560
Yes, I was.

05:41.560 --> 05:44.560
But I didn't want to miss springtime in Mum and Valley.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.560
What did you do?

05:46.560 --> 05:48.560
I'll tell you later.

05:48.560 --> 05:52.560
Let's go wake up, Snuff, and think of something exciting to do.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.560
I don't think he'll like it.

06:03.560 --> 06:06.560
He's still snoring, Mum, and I'll do it again.

06:08.560 --> 06:12.560
Well, that's done it.

06:14.560 --> 06:18.560
Come on, Snuff, it's spring. Snuffkin's here.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.560
Please go away, you two.

06:20.560 --> 06:23.560
We're going to do something really exciting.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.560
Like what, Momen?

06:25.560 --> 06:28.560
I can think of more exciting things to do than this.

06:28.560 --> 06:32.560
Well, let's imagine that we're the first ever to climb this mountain.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.560
It's such a clear day.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.560
We'll be able to see all of Mum and Valley

06:36.560 --> 06:38.560
when we get to the top and the sea.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.560
Good morning, Mr. Emulant.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.560
Morning, Mum, and are your father and mother up?

06:48.560 --> 06:49.560
Yes.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.560
Mum was when I came out.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.560
Good.

06:53.560 --> 06:56.560
I'll never understand how you can sleep for months on end.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.560
We like it.

07:05.560 --> 07:09.560
Why do they always have to do something exciting?

07:13.560 --> 07:15.560
What a gorgeous view.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.560
It really is.

07:17.560 --> 07:21.560
Hey, look, they're small coming from Mum and House.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.560
We should have stayed at home.

07:23.560 --> 07:26.560
My bet Mum and Mama's cooking something good.

07:26.560 --> 07:27.560
Look.

07:27.560 --> 07:28.560
What is it?

07:28.560 --> 07:30.560
We're not the first here after all.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.560
Look over there.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.560
Top hat.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.560
Hmm, a rather large one.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.560
I wonder who's how it is.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.560
I don't know, but I know Papa would like it.

07:54.560 --> 07:57.560
Hmm, it's much too big.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.560
Oh dear, what's it?

08:04.560 --> 08:06.560
It really gets inside.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.560
You see?

08:09.560 --> 08:11.560
I've never put my horn on.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.560
Oh, I can't movement it.

08:18.560 --> 08:19.560
Stop, Mum.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.560
Oh, that's enough nonsense.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.560
I think I'll take it off now.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.560
What's the matter?

08:32.560 --> 08:35.560
I can't move it. It's stuck, Mum.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.560
I'll give you a hand.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.560
Paul, it's harder.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.560
Oh, that's better.

08:48.560 --> 08:49.560
Thank you.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.560
What's all this noise?

08:50.560 --> 08:53.560
Papa's head got stuck in the hat, Mum.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.560
Oh, yes, and where did that come from?

08:55.560 --> 08:56.560
Oh, Mum and Mama.

08:56.560 --> 09:00.560
The children found it when they were out and brought it back for me.

09:00.560 --> 09:01.560
Very smart.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.560
What shall we do with it, Papa?

09:05.560 --> 09:07.560
There is something strange about it.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.560
Shall I throw it away then?

09:09.560 --> 09:12.560
Oh, no, it's too good for that.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.560
Do we know anyone with a very big hand?

09:14.560 --> 09:16.560
No, Mum and Papa.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.560
I know what we can do with it.

09:19.560 --> 09:23.560
Ah, it's a...

09:23.560 --> 09:25.560
A waste paper basket, Mum and Mama.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.560
That's right. Well done, Snuffkin.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.560
That was easy.

09:29.560 --> 09:33.560
Come on, Snuffkin. Come and have some breakfast with us.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.560
Beautiful.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.560
Yes.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.560
Sorry to disturb you, but I'm going to see Mumin.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.560
Uh-huh.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.560
Do you want to come with me, Snork?

10:08.560 --> 10:09.560
Uh-huh.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.560
Or would you rather stay here?

10:11.560 --> 10:12.560
Uh-huh.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.560
Well, are you coming or not?

10:14.560 --> 10:15.560
Uh-huh.

10:15.560 --> 10:16.560
Not coming, man?

10:16.560 --> 10:17.560
Uh-huh.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.560
Snork?

10:18.560 --> 10:22.560
Well,~] you know my flying ship is almost finished.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.560
It'll be ready this year, you'll see.

10:25.560 --> 10:27.560
This is in his starlet moment.

10:31.560 --> 10:35.560
Oh, dear. Perhaps it needs a little more work.

10:39.560 --> 10:42.560
I wonder if you really can make a flying ship.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.560
Don't be silly, of course you can't.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.560
A little bit more.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.560
I wonder if you really can make a flying ship.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.560
Silly, of course you can't.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.560
A little, my Snorks always dreamed about doing it.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.560
Dreams are all right.

10:57.560 --> 11:00.560
Yes, as long as they're not impossible.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.560
I suppose so.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.560
Snuff, you're not still feeding your face, are you?

11:10.560 --> 11:12.560
Do you ever dream, Snuff?

11:12.560 --> 11:16.560
Only nightmares about having no food at all, little, my.

11:21.560 --> 11:25.560
Hmm, I wonder who dropped this.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.560
Now where can I put it?

11:28.560 --> 11:31.560
Oh, there you are.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.560
Just the thing.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.560
Oh.

12:05.560 --> 12:06.560
Oh.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.560
Wow.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.560
Golly, what are they?

12:09.560 --> 12:11.560
They're clouds.

12:11.560 --> 12:14.560
Be careful, don't touch it. It might be poisonous.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.560
It feels like cotton.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.560
Well, eee.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.560
This is great, I'm floating wonderful.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.560
Can I try?

12:26.560 --> 12:28.560
Are you ready, Snork Maiden?

12:28.560 --> 12:31.560
Here we go.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.560
What have you got to hide?

12:43.560 --> 12:45.560
My phone.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.560
Wait for me.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.560
Hey, wait for me.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.560
Whoa.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.560
Whoa.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.560
Hey, wait for me.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.560
Let me get on.

12:59.560 --> 13:00.560
Ow.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.560
Ow, I'm falling.

13:08.560 --> 13:13.560
Mumen Papa is in his study, trying to write his memoirs.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.560
A lot has happened to him over the years.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.560
An awful lot.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.560
And he's trying to remember it.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.560
What was that?

13:31.560 --> 13:33.560
Mumen.

13:33.560 --> 13:34.560
Hi, Papa.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.560
What are you doing out there?

13:36.560 --> 13:37.560
We're flying.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.560
The clouds just came out of the house.

13:40.560 --> 13:43.560
Yeah, try and get nearest so I can reach you.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.560
Oh.

13:45.560 --> 13:46.560
No, I'm alright.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.560
Why don't you come for a ride?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.560
Stop, wait a minute.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.560
It's great.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.560
You feel like a bird.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.560
Mumen.

13:53.560 --> 13:54.560
Oh.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.560
Come on, Papa. Jump or you'll fall.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.560
I think it's too late.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.560
Oh.

14:05.560 --> 14:06.560
Mumen Mama quickly.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.560
What's the matter?

14:07.560 --> 14:09.560
Have you seen what the children are doing?

14:10.560 --> 14:11.560
Yes.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.560
Look at them.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.560
They're flying about on clouds.

14:14.560 --> 14:15.560
It can't be safe.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.560
Don't worry, Papa.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.560
It's alright.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.560
I told them to be careful.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.560
Come on, Snapping.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.560
Damn.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.560
I won, I won.

14:31.560 --> 14:32.560
Whoa.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.560
Hey, wait a little cloud.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.560
Wait for me.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.560
Don't go away.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.560
Oh.

14:37.560 --> 14:38.560
I got you.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.560
That was three times.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.560
And I'm going to climb right up here.

14:41.560 --> 14:42.560
And I'm going to get you right there.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.560
This branch.

14:43.560 --> 14:44.560
Come on.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.560
Come on, little cloud.

14:45.560 --> 14:46.560
I'm going to take you with me.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.560
Hey, come on.

14:47.560 --> 14:48.560
You just keep coming back.

14:48.560 --> 14:49.560
Yeah.

14:49.560 --> 14:50.560
Yeah.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.560
I got you now.

14:51.560 --> 14:52.560
You are going to get away from me.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.560
Here I go.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.560
Come on.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.560
All of that ledge.

14:55.560 --> 14:56.560
Come on.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.560
Stop.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.560
I want you.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.560
Oh.

15:05.560 --> 15:06.560
Oh, boy.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.560
What's happening?

15:07.560 --> 15:09.560
My cloud's starting to go.

15:09.560 --> 15:10.560
Oh, whoa, whoa.

15:10.560 --> 15:11.560
That was fun.

15:11.560 --> 15:14.560
Yeah, it was, but I wasn't ready to stop.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.560
Look, there's movement in Snork Maiden.

15:16.560 --> 15:17.560
Hey.

15:17.560 --> 15:21.560
Why have they still got cloud snuffed in?

15:21.560 --> 15:23.560
There's a starting to go as well.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.560
I think they'd better get off.

15:25.560 --> 15:26.560
Hey.

15:29.560 --> 15:38.560
All right.

15:38.560 --> 15:39.560
All right.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.560
I'll start counting.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.560
One, two, three.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.560
Do you want something, little mime?

15:45.560 --> 15:46.560
Oh, yes.

15:46.560 --> 15:47.560
A place to hide.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.560
Five...

15:49.560 --> 15:54.560
Six...

15:54.560 --> 15:58.560
Seven...

15:58.560 --> 16:04.560
Boy, I don't think there's any place to hide in here, is there?

16:04.560 --> 16:06.560
No!

16:06.560 --> 16:09.560
Oh, it's too dirty in there.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.560
I'm gonna have...

16:10.560 --> 16:11.560
I know.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.560
I'll hide in the head.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.560
One, two, one, two, one.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.560
She hit!

16:42.560 --> 16:44.560
Oh!

16:51.560 --> 16:52.560
Gotcha!

16:53.560 --> 16:55.560
What's going on?

16:55.560 --> 16:57.560
Huh?

16:57.560 --> 16:59.560
Huh?

16:59.560 --> 17:01.560
Huh?

17:01.560 --> 17:05.560
Snort made, huh?

17:15.560 --> 17:19.560
Hehehe!

17:19.560 --> 17:21.560
Baaah!

17:23.560 --> 17:25.560
Moomin must be around here somewhere.

17:25.560 --> 17:29.560
Well, last time I saw him, he was hiding in the fireplace.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.560
Have you found him yet?

17:31.560 --> 17:33.560
No. Have you looked in the cellar?

17:33.560 --> 17:35.560
Yes, I have.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.560
Wait a minute. Did you hear someone laughing?

17:39.560 --> 17:41.560
Where'd it come from?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.560
G.I. better go home.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.560
Oh, is there anything wrong?

17:45.560 --> 17:48.560
Yes. I can't find Moomin anywhere.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.560
Well, he's too fat to be most places.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.560
He's coming from under the hat!

18:02.560 --> 18:04.560
Well, here I am, sniff.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.560
Oh, on earth are you!

18:08.560 --> 18:10.560
I one land didn't I?

18:10.560 --> 18:12.560
You looked everywhere in the house

18:12.560 --> 18:14.560
and you couldn't find me, could you?

18:14.560 --> 18:16.560
So I won!

18:16.560 --> 18:18.560
I don't want to find you anyway!

18:18.560 --> 18:20.560
Well, you were trying hard enough, weren't you?

18:20.560 --> 18:22.560
What is this, a new game?

18:22.560 --> 18:24.560
My name's Snork Maiden.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.560
What's yours?

18:26.560 --> 18:28.560
I'm the king of Moomin Valley.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.560
My pretty one.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.560
You're too ugly to be the king of anything.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.560
Well, now, that's not a very nice thing to say to your friend.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.560
Is it, Papa?

18:38.560 --> 18:42.560
Now, you'd better tell me what you have done with Moomin, huh?

18:42.560 --> 18:44.560
But I'm here.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.560
Right here.

18:46.560 --> 18:50.560
Who are you? And where is Moomin?

18:52.560 --> 18:54.560
Papa.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.560
I'm certainly not your Papa.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.560
Yes, you are. Come on. I'm Moomin.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.560
I don't know who you are.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.560
But you're not Moomin.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.560
He's nice and handsome and nothing like you.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.560
Have you looked at yourself in a mirror?

19:08.560 --> 19:10.560
Ah!

19:10.560 --> 19:12.560
Where's my nose gone?

19:12.560 --> 19:14.560
I can't hear it anymore.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.560
Ah! Oh no!

19:16.560 --> 19:18.560
My tail's all pushy!

19:18.560 --> 19:20.560
Ah!

19:20.560 --> 19:22.560
Oh!

19:24.560 --> 19:26.560
Ah!

19:26.560 --> 19:28.560
This is terrible!

19:28.560 --> 19:30.560
Oh!

19:34.560 --> 19:36.560
Who are you?

19:36.560 --> 19:38.560
What have you done with me?

19:38.560 --> 19:40.560
It must be a nightmare!

19:40.560 --> 19:42.560
I want to go back!

19:42.560 --> 19:46.560
Go away, you're horrible!

19:46.560 --> 19:48.560
Dear me, what's all this noise?

19:48.560 --> 19:50.560
What's happened?

19:52.560 --> 19:54.560
Mama!

19:54.560 --> 19:56.560
Mama!

19:56.560 --> 19:58.560
What earth is this?

19:58.560 --> 20:00.560
He says he's Moomin, but just look at him.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.560
You don't look like I'm Moomin.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.560
I am, I am.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.560
Please believe me, Mama.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.560
I am Moomin.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.560
Well, I don't know.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.560
I'm sure.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.560
Something's happened to me.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.560
Why do I look so different?

20:16.560 --> 20:18.560
Now then calm down.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.560
This won't help at all.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.560
We don't need all this noise.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.560
If you really are Moomin,

20:24.560 --> 20:26.560
then everything will be all right.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.560
Just give me a minute or two and I'll know.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.560
Mama, call me Moomin, please.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.560
I don't know what's happened, but I am me.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.560
Honestly, I am.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.560
Mama, please believeed me.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.560
Let me see.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.560
Oh, Mama, you do know it's me.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.560
You must.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.560
You can't forget your little Moomin.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.560
Please, Mama, please, Mama.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.560
Oh, hush now, hush now.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.560
Mama!

20:58.560 --> 21:00.560
Shh!

21:00.560 --> 21:06.560
Yes, you're my little Moomin, all right.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.560
Oh, Mama!

21:20.560 --> 21:22.560
Oh.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.560
Oh, Moomin.

21:28.560 --> 21:29.560
Papa.

21:29.560 --> 21:31.560
Oh, Moomin, my boy.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.560
Where were you hiding?

21:33.560 --> 21:35.560
In there.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.560
In the hat?

21:45.560 --> 21:49.560
Let's hope it's the last we'll see of it.

21:49.560 --> 21:53.560
Moomin Papa decided that although it was a fine hat,

21:53.560 --> 21:55.560
it was too dangerous to keep.

21:55.560 --> 21:59.560
So Moomin threw it in the river and it floated away.

21:59.560 --> 22:01.560
He wasn't too sure about it though,

22:01.560 --> 22:05.560
because it was a rather special hat.

22:25.560 --> 22:29.560
The Moomin's are having fun day after day.

22:29.560 --> 22:31.560
The Moomin's.

22:31.560 --> 22:35.560
The Moomin's.

22:35.560 --> 22:39.560
They love the laughter and they love the living.

22:39.560 --> 22:43.560
The Moomin's.

22:43.560 --> 22:49.560
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

22:49.560 --> 22:53.560
They're always happy and goes at play.

22:53.560 --> 22:57.560
The Moomin's are having fun day after day.

22:57.560 --> 23:01.560
The Moomin's.

23:01.560 --> 23:05.560
The Moomin's.

23:05.560 --> 23:11.560
The Moomin's.

23:23.560 --> 23:27.560
Here they are for one and all.

23:27.560 --> 23:31.560
The Moomin's are about to call.

23:31.560 --> 23:35.560
Come on and sit down here with me.

23:35.560 --> 23:39.560
They're here for you on your TV.

23:39.560 --> 23:43.560
They are the Moomin's.

23:43.560 --> 23:47.560
They are the Moomin's.

23:47.560 --> 23:51.560
So come with me, give me your hand.

23:51.560 --> 23:55.560
You can fly just like a bird.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.560
Sing that song ever.

23:57.560 --> 24:01.560
There were the Moomin's.

24:01.560 --> 24:05.560
There were the Moomin's.

24:05.560 --> 24:09.560
There were the Moomin's.

24:09.560 --> 24:13.560
There were the Moomin's.

24:13.560 --> 24:17.560
There were the Moomin's.

24:17.560 --> 24:23.560
There were the Moomin's.

24:23.560 --> 24:27.560
There were the Moomin's.

24:27.560 --> 24:31.560
There were the Moomin's.

24:31.560 --> 24:35.560
There were the Moomin's.

24:35.560 --> 24:39.560
There were the Moomin's.

24:39.560 --> 24:43.560
There were the Moomin's.

24:43.560 --> 24:49.560
There were the Moomin's.

24:49.560 --> 24:53.560
There were the Moomin's.

24:53.560 --> 24:57.560
There were the Moomin's.

24:57.560 --> 25:01.560
There were the Moomin's.

25:01.560 --> 25:05.560
There were the Moomin's.

25:05.560 --> 25:09.560
Snuffkin is put up his tent on the riverbank.

25:09.560 --> 25:12.560
He likes being on his own and has decided to stay there until winter comes.

25:12.560 --> 25:16.560
Snuffkin is a happy and a peace with the world.

25:16.560 --> 25:22.560
Moomin loves to spend as much time as he can as a friend as Snuffkin.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.560
Snuffkin?

25:24.560 --> 25:26.560
Snuffkin?

25:26.560 --> 25:28.560
Where are you?

25:28.560 --> 25:32.560
He must have forgotten I was coming and gone off somewhere.

25:32.560 --> 25:36.560
How can he enjoy being here on his own?

25:36.560 --> 25:38.560
I'd like to be alone now and then you know.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.560
Oh, silly, let's go and explore.

25:40.560 --> 25:41.560
Maiden.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.520
But we said we'd go today.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.200
Yeah, we did too, Moomin.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.480
You are the one that said it, you know.

25:47.480 --> 25:48.480
Hmm, you did.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.560
I didn't.

25:49.560 --> 25:50.760
You did too.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.200
Oh, you must come.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.960
We're going to collect shells on the beach.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.280
Come on, it'll be fun.

25:56.280 --> 25:57.120
Oh, no.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.440
Hey.

26:02.440 --> 26:04.160
It's sniff.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.960
Where are you guys going?

26:05.960 --> 26:08.360
Oh, I envy Snuffkin.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.400
Oh, why?

26:09.400 --> 26:11.120
I just do.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.960
I wonder where Snuffkin has gone.

26:13.960 --> 26:23.600
I wonder if we'll ever find anything as exciting as the hat.

26:23.600 --> 26:26.200
Yeah, it was very special that hat.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.320
Did you really throw it in the river?

26:28.320 --> 26:29.320
Yeah.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.760
I wish you hadn't.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.880
It was much too dangerous to keep.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.400
Look at the horrible things it did to me.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.720
But what about the eggshells it turned into clouds?

26:37.720 --> 26:40.400
Yeah, it was good fun flying around.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.280
Perhaps I'll find the nicer with a huge pearl inside.

26:43.280 --> 27:13.280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

27:13.280 --> 27:43.280
What? What's happened? We were playing tag and she fell into an ant lion hole. We've got to get her out quickly. Come on, moving. Nearly there is North Maiden just a bit further. Help me, sniff. Give me your hand. Hurry! Look out! It's the ant lion! Look what you're doing to my hole. I'm sorry. I'll be out soon. Stop yelling and kicking like that. You're scaring off my prey.

27:43.280 --> 28:13.280
Are you all right, Snark Maiden? I can't reach her. I don't have to have ants for lunch, you know. Don't be a woman, please. You better get in there, sniff. What? Me? Don't worry. I'll hold on to you. You're the only one tall enough, sniff. Come on. You look nice and tasty. I'll eat you and step. Good, sniff. Look, I'm getting there. You're big.

28:13.280 --> 28:21.280
Don't you call me a big whip? You gotta grab hold of me. I'll work for you.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.280
Thank you. Are you ready? Hold tight.

28:31.280 --> 28:37.280
Come on, nearly a bit.

29:01.280 --> 29:13.280
Where have you been, self-kin? That's a big secret, movement. I won't tell anyone.

29:13.280 --> 29:17.280
All right. It's the magic hat. It's on a sandbank further down the river.

29:17.280 --> 29:23.280
Gosh! But something terrible is happening. What? What is it?

29:23.280 --> 29:35.280
Oh dear, perhaps we shouldn't have thrown it in the river. It's too late now. Let's get there, Cookie.

29:35.280 --> 29:47.280
There it is. It's caught on a branch in the middle.

29:47.280 --> 29:53.280
Where? Oh, Smurfkin. I can see it. Look at the water. It's all red.

29:53.280 --> 29:57.280
Hmm. Seems to be coming from the hat. I wonder what it is, move.

29:57.280 --> 30:03.280
I'll go and get it. Be careful. Shall I come too?

30:03.280 --> 30:13.280
No, you stay there. Have you got it? Uh-huh.

30:34.280 --> 30:40.280
Wow! It's raspberry juice. What should we do with the hat?

30:40.280 --> 30:45.280
Well, I don't think it's a good idea to leave it lying around. Somebody might crawl into it.

30:45.280 --> 30:49.280
But if we put water in it, we can have as much raspberry juice as we can drink.

30:49.280 --> 30:56.280
Well, that would be nice. But you know, movement. It could only be river water that does that. You know what I mean, movement?

30:56.280 --> 31:03.280
Well, I think it's worth experimenting.

31:15.280 --> 31:21.280
What's the matter, Mullen? You look very tired. I woke up in the night and couldn't get back to sleep.

31:21.280 --> 31:26.280
Pardon? Couldn't get back to sleep. Huh. What are you talking about?

31:26.280 --> 31:32.280
I was awake last night too. And I know why you're so tired.

31:32.280 --> 31:38.280
You must have been dreaming. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in a hurry. Thanks, mama.

31:38.280 --> 31:42.280
Where are you going, movement? Movement!

31:42.280 --> 31:46.280
Somewhere you can't come. Somewhere private.

31:46.280 --> 31:49.280
So, what was that all about, huh?

31:49.280 --> 31:54.280
Oh, nothing really important, movement, papa.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.280
I think I'll go out.

32:04.280 --> 32:09.280
Ha-ha. Nobody hides anything from little, my.

32:09.280 --> 32:16.280
Snopkin!

32:16.280 --> 32:23.280
Hey, I found out who's had it is. Who's?

32:23.280 --> 32:25.280
The Hobgoblins. The Hobgoblins.

32:25.280 --> 32:30.280
Yeah, I asked the emulant and he told me that he saw him once long ago wearing that.

32:30.280 --> 32:33.280
I heard about the wizard who flies in the sky.

32:33.280 --> 32:38.280
Yeah, on the back of a black panther. The Hobgoblins is hundreds of years old and cares only for rubies.

32:38.280 --> 32:45.280
He rides all over the world, searching for them. He's truly awesome.

32:45.280 --> 32:48.280
And so, when he dropped his hat?

32:48.280 --> 32:52.280
He must have been looking for some rubies right here in Moomin Valley.

32:52.280 --> 32:55.280
Do you think he's got a lot of hats, Snopkin?

32:55.280 --> 32:57.280
Gee, I don't know.

32:57.280 --> 33:00.280
Well, do you think perhaps he doesn't know where he dropped his hat?

33:00.280 --> 33:03.280
Yeah, I suppose that's possible.

33:03.280 --> 33:07.280
Snopkin, there's something I would like to try with the hat.

33:07.280 --> 33:14.280
Just don't put it on. Will you?

33:14.280 --> 33:19.280
He's in there somewhere. Hat lions are pretty stupid, you know.

33:19.280 --> 33:23.280
Yes, Moomin Papa told me it takes him hours to take themselves into the sand.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.280
Oh, no, it doesn't. It only takes the one hour.

33:26.280 --> 33:28.280
Only an hour? You're kidding.

33:28.280 --> 33:32.280
Well, of course, an hour is a long time to spend, digging.

33:32.280 --> 33:34.280
Are you talking about me?

33:34.280 --> 33:39.280
Yes, about how quickly you could dig yourself into a hole in the sand.

33:39.280 --> 33:42.280
A lot quicker than you think it'll take.

33:42.280 --> 33:46.280
Moomin here says it takes you only one hour to dig a hole in the sand.

33:46.280 --> 33:49.280
But I can't believe that.

33:49.280 --> 33:52.280
Snopkin says it takes several hours, but I think he's wrong.

33:52.280 --> 33:55.280
I'll show you how long.

33:55.280 --> 33:58.280
Gosh, that was rather fast.

33:58.280 --> 34:02.280
Yeah, but it's obvious he's already got a ready-made hole hidden there.

34:02.280 --> 34:05.280
Don't you, Aunt Lion.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.280
No, I do not.

34:08.280 --> 34:13.280
I can dig myself in anywhere, anywhere at all.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.280
How about here?

34:20.280 --> 34:23.280
Yeah, okay. Under this rock. All right?

34:23.280 --> 34:25.280
Anywhere. Just show me.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.280
Okay, start from here.

34:27.280 --> 34:29.280
Yeah, just there, if you don't mind.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.280
All right, start counting.

34:36.280 --> 34:39.280
Wow, you only took a second and a half.

34:39.280 --> 34:41.280
He's really something, isn't he?

34:41.280 --> 34:43.280
He certainly is.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.280
I'd better sit on it.

34:45.280 --> 34:48.280
Yeah, he'll be really mad.

35:00.280 --> 35:04.280
So you've caught the Aunt Lion. I've been watching.

35:04.280 --> 35:05.280
Little boy.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.280
Right.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.280
Did you follow us last night?

35:09.280 --> 35:10.280
Yes.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.280
Did you tell the others?

35:12.280 --> 35:15.280
Oh, don't be silly, you guys. I haven't said a word yet.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.280
But you will if we don't let you join in with us.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.280
That's what she's doing, Moomin.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.280
No, as if I do such a thing.

35:22.280 --> 35:26.280
Of course, I'm forgetting how nice and kind you are.

35:27.280 --> 35:29.280
Hey, what is that?

35:37.280 --> 35:39.280
Nope, no hat anywhere.

35:45.280 --> 35:47.280
There's gallons of water.

35:47.280 --> 35:51.280
Gosh, there sure must be a lot of sand in there.

35:51.280 --> 35:54.280
He must have changed into something else by now.

35:54.280 --> 35:55.280
Probably.

35:56.280 --> 35:59.280
It must have been long enough. I'll jump off.

36:01.280 --> 36:05.280
He isn't strong enough to move the rock by himself.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.280
Shall we help him?

36:06.280 --> 36:07.280
No, don't.

36:07.280 --> 36:09.280
Come on, let's do it.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.280
What's happened to him?

36:15.280 --> 36:17.280
Let's turn it over.

36:17.280 --> 36:20.280
Oh, no, I can't look.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.280
Oh.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.280
It's a hedgehog.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.280
It's a hedgehog.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.280
It's a hedgehog.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.280
You.

36:53.280 --> 36:54.280
What?

36:54.280 --> 36:55.280
You're a hedgehog.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.280
Yeah.

37:15.280 --> 37:16.280
Moomin.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.280
I'll stop it.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.280
Don't push me a little bit.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.280
Why?

37:24.280 --> 37:25.280
Moomin.

37:49.280 --> 37:51.280
Moomin.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.280
I just saw the hobgoblin.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.280
What?

37:54.280 --> 37:56.280
It must have been him.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.280
Do you think he was looking for his hat?

37:58.280 --> 37:59.280
I'm afraid so.

37:59.280 --> 38:01.280
I hope you hit it well.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.280
The seller.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.280
Will it be safe there?

38:06.280 --> 38:09.280
Well, only little my and us two know where it is.

38:09.280 --> 38:10.280
Hmm.

38:18.280 --> 38:20.280
The red?

38:23.280 --> 38:27.280
I wonder if it's possible to change it into spaghetti.

38:33.280 --> 38:35.280
Huh?

38:40.280 --> 38:42.280
Hmm.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.280
Not exactly spaghetti.

38:49.280 --> 38:50.280
Mama!

38:50.280 --> 38:51.280
Mama!

38:52.280 --> 38:55.280
There's something I think you ought to know.

38:55.280 --> 38:56.280
What is it, dear?

38:56.280 --> 38:59.280
There are strange things happening in the house.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.280
In the house?

39:00.280 --> 39:02.280
There's a tree in the seller.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.280
A tree?

39:03.280 --> 39:05.280
That's nice.

39:06.280 --> 39:10.280
What did you say, a real tree?

39:11.280 --> 39:14.280
Yes, and it seems to be growing and growing.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.280
What have you done, little my?

39:16.280 --> 39:19.280
Just dropped a bit of thread into the magic hat.

39:19.280 --> 39:21.280
But Moomin threw it away.

39:21.280 --> 39:22.280
Yeah, we did.

39:22.280 --> 39:25.280
But we sort of found it again and put it in the seller.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.280
Oh, dear.

39:26.280 --> 39:30.280
We must tell Moomin Papa before it's too late.

39:31.280 --> 39:33.280
Come in.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.280
It's not locked.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.280
Keep going, tree.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.280
You can grow as big as you like.

39:43.280 --> 39:46.280
And just tell me if you're thirsty or anything.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.280
And how about some fruit soon?

39:52.280 --> 39:54.280
I really like pears.

39:55.280 --> 39:58.280
Come in.

39:58.280 --> 40:01.280
I'm very sorry to disturb you, Papa.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.280
What is it?

40:03.280 --> 40:05.280
Well, it's not good.

40:05.280 --> 40:08.280
What do you mean, not good?

40:08.280 --> 40:11.280
I think you'd better come down and have a look at once.

40:11.280 --> 40:15.280
So you can see for yourself what's happening before it's too late.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.280
Too late?

40:17.280 --> 40:19.280
Oh, that sounds a bit ominous.

40:19.280 --> 40:22.280
Don't worry, I'll sort it out whatever the catastrophe.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.280
Now, listen you.

40:27.280 --> 40:31.280
You leave my husband's desk alone or you'll be sorry.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.280
All right, dear.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.280
I'm coming.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.280
Oh.

40:36.280 --> 40:38.280
Well, this is definitely a catastrophe.

40:38.280 --> 40:41.280
I think you'd better get me a saw, Mama.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.280
Oh, sure.

40:43.280 --> 40:47.280
Everything's in the seller and it would be a bit difficult to get in there now, Moomin Papa.

40:47.280 --> 40:48.280
They'll never mind.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.280
We haven't got time.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.280
I'll break them by hand.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.280
Oh.

41:09.280 --> 41:11.280
Gee, look at Moomin house.

41:11.280 --> 41:12.280
Come on, Snork Maiden.

41:12.280 --> 41:14.280
This is fun.

41:14.280 --> 41:16.280
But what happened, little Mai?

41:16.280 --> 41:18.280
I've been gardening that tall.

41:18.280 --> 41:20.280
Aren't I clever?

41:21.280 --> 41:23.280
Whoo!

41:27.280 --> 41:30.280
Well, this catastrophe is going on too long.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.280
I'm hungry.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.280
Oh.

41:32.280 --> 41:34.280
Look on the bright side, Papa.

41:34.280 --> 41:37.280
It could be a long time before we run out of firewood.

41:37.280 --> 41:38.280
There.

41:38.280 --> 41:39.280
Take that.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.280
Oh, oh.

41:40.280 --> 41:43.280
Dad will teach you to try and take over Moomin house.

41:44.280 --> 41:51.280
Papa, look at all these lovely flowers.

41:54.280 --> 41:56.280
And fruit.

41:59.280 --> 42:02.280
Papa, Papa, you must try some.

42:02.280 --> 42:05.280
Oh, they're lovely and juicy.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.280
Oh, no.

42:11.280 --> 42:14.280
Little Mai must have put something into the hat.

42:20.280 --> 42:22.280
Moomin, where are you, Moomin?

42:22.280 --> 42:23.280
Moomin.

42:23.280 --> 42:24.280
Here I am.

42:24.280 --> 42:29.280
Oh, Moomin, I was afraid that you were inside the house.

42:29.280 --> 42:32.280
Mama, Papa, little Mai.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.280
They can't get out.

42:34.280 --> 42:36.280
We'll need some saws and axes.

42:36.280 --> 42:38.280
They must all be in the cellar and we can't get in this way.

42:38.280 --> 42:40.280
We must try and find another way.

42:40.280 --> 42:42.280
All right, I'll run and get some help.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.280
You do not have to, little one.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.280
Are you the hobgoblin, sir?

42:53.280 --> 42:54.280
I am he.

42:54.280 --> 42:57.280
I can see that you have found my hat.

42:57.280 --> 42:58.280
Yes, sir.

42:58.280 --> 43:00.280
It was on top of the mountain.

43:00.280 --> 43:02.280
I think the...

43:02.280 --> 43:05.280
That tree seems to be doing remarkably well.

43:06.280 --> 43:08.280
However, away with thee.

43:25.280 --> 43:26.280
Oh, my God.

43:26.280 --> 43:28.280
Goodness be, I hope.

43:28.280 --> 43:30.280
Oh, my God.

43:36.280 --> 43:41.280
Oh, that really is some hat you have there, Mr. Hobgoblin.

43:41.280 --> 43:43.280
I'm sorry, I troubled you.

43:43.280 --> 43:47.280
We're just glad you came along when you did, Mr. Hobgoblin.

43:47.280 --> 43:49.280
You're most kind, madam.

43:49.280 --> 43:53.280
I don't suppose you'd have any uncommonly large rubies here, would you?

43:53.280 --> 43:56.280
You finding my hat here must be an omen.

43:59.280 --> 44:02.280
Here you are, Mr. Hobgoblin.

44:02.280 --> 44:05.280
My husband, Moomin Papa, gave it to me.

44:08.280 --> 44:11.280
It is fine indeed, and you are lucky to have it.

44:11.280 --> 44:15.280
But I'm afraid it is not the King's Ruby I am looking for.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.280
What do you mean, King's Ruby?

44:17.280 --> 44:20.280
I have searched for it for hundreds of years, Moomin Mama.

44:20.280 --> 44:24.280
I'm afraid I am obsessed by it and cannot find it anywhere.

44:24.280 --> 44:27.280
Well, if we see it, we'll light a signal fire.

44:27.280 --> 44:29.280
You are mosted kind, madam.

44:29.280 --> 44:32.280
And I feel we shall meet again soon.

44:44.280 --> 44:47.280
He's not bad for a Hobgoblin.

44:50.280 --> 44:54.280
Come on, everybody. Let's start stacking up all this wood.

44:54.280 --> 44:56.280
Okay, let's do it.

44:56.280 --> 44:58.280
Come on.

45:09.280 --> 45:14.280
And so the Hobgoblin's hat finally disappeared from Moomin Valley.

45:14.280 --> 45:18.280
Moomin rather missed having an ever-ending supply of raspberry juice,

45:18.280 --> 45:22.280
but his parents were more than happy that it had gone.

45:23.280 --> 45:32.280
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

45:32.280 --> 45:39.280
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

45:39.280 --> 45:43.280
They're always happy and always at play.

45:43.280 --> 45:50.280
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

45:50.280 --> 46:00.280
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

46:00.280 --> 46:08.280
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

46:08.280 --> 46:12.280
They're always happy and always at play.

46:12.280 --> 46:19.280
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.

46:19.280 --> 46:23.280
The movements.

46:23.280 --> 46:29.280
The movements.

46:29.280 --> 46:33.280
The movements.

47:00.280 --> 47:04.280
The movements.

47:04.280 --> 47:09.280
The movements.

47:09.280 --> 47:13.280
I'll take you up to Moomin land.

47:13.280 --> 47:17.280
You can fly just like a bird.

47:17.280 --> 47:19.280
Sing that song ever.

47:19.280 --> 47:23.280
There were the movements.

47:23.280 --> 47:27.280
There were the movements.

47:27.280 --> 47:31.280
There were the movements.

47:31.280 --> 47:35.280
There were the movements.

47:58.280 --> 48:22.280
The sun is shining and Moomin Valley is enjoying its usual peace and tranquility.

48:22.280 --> 48:23.280
Wait a minute.

48:23.280 --> 48:26.280
Moomin Valley is enjoying its usual peace and tranquility.

48:26.280 --> 48:28.280
Who's this?

48:28.280 --> 48:30.280
Wait for me, Moomin!

48:35.280 --> 48:37.280
Mama! Mama!

48:37.280 --> 48:39.280
Are they ready?

48:39.280 --> 48:40.280
Are what ready?

48:40.280 --> 48:41.280
The pancakes!

48:41.280 --> 48:44.280
Not yet. This hobgoblin wood doesn't seem to burn very well.

48:44.280 --> 48:45.280
Aren't they cooking?

48:45.280 --> 48:48.280
They won't be long. Have some lemonade while you're waiting.

48:48.280 --> 48:51.280
Mama! Are the pancakes ready yet?

48:51.280 --> 48:54.280
Oh well. Everything seems normal in the Moomin house.

48:55.280 --> 48:59.280
I'm a dumbo, I'm a no-good-me-goboot-niny.

48:59.280 --> 49:02.280
No, you're not, Snork. You're very clever.

49:02.280 --> 49:06.280
No, I'm a failure of floppy, frightful fraud and a misfit.

49:06.280 --> 49:10.280
But your landship was a success? Wasn't it?

49:10.280 --> 49:12.280
Kid stuff!

49:12.280 --> 49:15.280
Look, if you can make a ship that runs on land,

49:15.280 --> 49:18.280
then I'm sure you can make one that flies. I believe in you.

49:18.280 --> 49:22.280
Fat lot of good, that does me, Snork and Maiden.

49:23.280 --> 49:26.280
You know, last night I thought,

49:26.280 --> 49:30.280
I'd done it, a fly ship, then I looked at it again.

49:30.280 --> 49:33.280
No good, no good. It was all wrong.

49:33.280 --> 49:35.280
Wouldn't, couldn't fly at all.

49:35.280 --> 49:39.280
Or how could someone so intelligent be such an idiot?

49:39.280 --> 49:41.280
Oh dear, oh dear.

49:44.280 --> 49:47.280
Well, they're ready. Go and tell the others little Mai.

49:47.280 --> 49:49.280
All right, Moomin, Mama.

49:49.280 --> 49:51.280
Where's Moomin and Snork Maiden?

49:51.280 --> 49:53.280
Snork Maiden's fallen again.

49:55.280 --> 49:57.280
Come on, Snork Maiden, cheer up.

49:57.280 --> 49:59.280
I'm sure Snork will get over it.

49:59.280 --> 50:02.280
Inventors always feel down in the dumps when something doesn't work.

50:02.280 --> 50:04.280
Does Moomin, Papa, do you think?

50:04.280 --> 50:07.280
He invents stories. Doesn't he, Moomin?

50:07.280 --> 50:09.280
Well, where Moomin was, really?

50:09.280 --> 50:12.280
Snork Maiden, do you want some pancakes?

50:12.280 --> 50:14.280
Oh, yes, please, Moomin, Mama.

50:14.280 --> 50:16.280
Moomin, go and get Papa.

50:16.280 --> 50:19.280
I have a feeling he's writing his gut stuck again.

50:19.280 --> 50:21.280
Okay, Mama.

50:21.280 --> 50:24.280
Now, what's the matter, Snork Maiden?

50:27.280 --> 50:30.280
Well, the sun returned to the eastern sky when morning came

50:30.280 --> 50:32.280
and everything started to get lighter and lighter.

50:32.280 --> 50:34.280
Oh dear, everybody knows that.

50:34.280 --> 50:38.280
Even the stupidest retard, really.

50:38.280 --> 50:41.280
I have absolutely no literary talent.

50:41.280 --> 50:44.280
I'm an ignoramus son, a literate dilatant,

50:44.280 --> 50:46.280
nor an illiterate idiot.

50:46.280 --> 50:48.280
It's high time I gave up writing.

50:48.280 --> 50:50.280
Oh.

50:50.280 --> 50:52.280
Yes?

50:52.280 --> 50:53.280
Papa?

50:53.280 --> 50:55.280
Yeah, what is it, Moomin?

50:55.280 --> 50:59.280
Uh, Mama said to tell you the pancakes are ready.

50:59.280 --> 51:03.280
Well, I can't stop now. I'm being creative. I'll eat later.

51:03.280 --> 51:05.280
Oh, really?

51:05.280 --> 51:07.280
Yes, anything else?

51:07.280 --> 51:10.280
Yeah, no. I thought you said something.

51:18.280 --> 51:20.280
Moomin, wait, I'm coming.

51:27.280 --> 51:29.280
That was really good, Moomin, Mama.

51:29.280 --> 51:31.280
I'm going out.

51:31.280 --> 51:32.280
I'm coming.

51:32.280 --> 51:33.280
No, you can't.

51:33.280 --> 51:35.280
Snuffkin and I are going on an adventure

51:35.280 --> 51:37.280
and it could be dangerous.

51:43.280 --> 51:45.280
Nice, Snuffkin.

51:45.280 --> 51:47.280
Hello, Moomin. Didn't think you were coming.

51:47.280 --> 51:49.280
Sorry, I'm late. What's that?

51:49.280 --> 51:50.280
A leaf boat.

51:50.280 --> 51:53.280
Look, it sails on the river just like a real one.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.280
I bet it goes all the way down to the sea

51:58.280 --> 52:00.280
and maybe even to some foreign lands.

52:00.280 --> 52:03.280
Gosh, Snuffkin, I'd like to do that one day.

52:03.280 --> 52:05.280
Let's go then, shall we?

52:05.280 --> 52:09.280
Little Mai wanted to come, but I told her it was too dangerous.

52:09.280 --> 52:12.280
Hmm, perhaps that wasn't the best thing to say.

52:12.280 --> 52:14.280
Look.

52:15.280 --> 52:17.280
I thought they could use a bit of fun.

52:17.280 --> 52:19.280
Wait, Moomin.

52:26.280 --> 52:29.280
Are we really going to climb up there?

52:29.280 --> 52:31.280
Look, I don't think we can all go.

52:31.280 --> 52:33.280
It'll just be Moomin and me.

52:33.280 --> 52:35.280
I'm not climbing up there.

52:35.280 --> 52:37.280
Well, I am.

52:37.280 --> 52:39.280
Wouldn't you like to keep me company instead?

52:39.280 --> 52:42.280
Look, there's a cave just a little bit further along this path.

52:43.280 --> 52:45.280
Why don't you two girls wait for us there?

52:45.280 --> 52:46.280
We won't be long.

52:46.280 --> 52:49.280
But if you can walk to it, why on earth climb to it?

52:49.280 --> 52:52.280
Ah, difficult for a girl to understand.

52:52.280 --> 52:55.280
Well, I think boys are difficult to understand.

52:55.280 --> 52:57.280
We're not sure we can reach it from above.

52:57.280 --> 52:59.280
Well, we'll soon find out.

52:59.280 --> 53:01.280
Are you coming with us, Snuff?

53:01.280 --> 53:03.280
Oh, I think I'll guard the rear.

53:03.280 --> 53:05.280
Protect the cave from below.

53:05.280 --> 53:07.280
Oh, yeah.

53:07.280 --> 53:10.280
Well, someone has to look after the girls.

53:10.280 --> 53:12.280
Someone responsible.

53:32.280 --> 53:34.280
Oh, my goodness, it's dark in there.

53:34.280 --> 53:35.280
Let's go in, then.

53:35.280 --> 53:37.280
I don't like the look of it.

53:37.280 --> 53:39.280
We'd better stay out here.

53:39.280 --> 53:41.280
You never know who might live in there.

53:41.280 --> 53:42.280
Don't be silly.

53:42.280 --> 53:44.280
No one lives in there.

53:44.280 --> 53:45.280
That's what I don't like.

53:45.280 --> 53:49.280
Yes, exactly a place with no one living in it is really scary.

53:53.280 --> 53:56.280
I think we must be right above the cave here.

53:56.280 --> 53:57.280
Maybe.

53:57.280 --> 53:59.280
I can't find a hole, though.

53:59.280 --> 54:02.280
Let's look a bit more over that way, Moomin.

54:03.280 --> 54:07.280
Wow, I've never seen a shell like this before.

54:07.280 --> 54:09.280
Oh, look at that one.

54:09.280 --> 54:11.280
They must be worth a fortune.

54:11.280 --> 54:13.280
Come over here and look, Little Mai.

54:15.280 --> 54:17.280
Where's Little Mai, Snork maidens?

54:17.280 --> 54:19.280
She went into the cave, Snuff.

54:19.280 --> 54:21.280
Oh, no, she can't do that.

54:21.280 --> 54:23.280
It might be dangerous.

54:26.280 --> 54:27.280
Little Mai!

54:27.280 --> 54:28.280
Little Mai!

54:28.280 --> 54:29.280
Come out!

54:29.280 --> 54:31.280
No, you come in, scaredy cat.

54:31.280 --> 54:33.280
You can't just go in like that.

54:33.280 --> 54:34.280
You can't.

54:34.280 --> 54:38.280
So tell me, how would you go in there and Mr. No at all?

54:38.280 --> 54:39.280
Stay where you are.

54:39.280 --> 54:41.280
We'll rescue you.

54:41.280 --> 54:44.280
You're coming, too, aren't you, Snork maiden?

54:44.280 --> 54:46.280
You can't stay here alone.

54:46.280 --> 54:48.280
I suppose so.

54:48.280 --> 54:50.280
What's that? Let's go.

54:50.280 --> 54:53.280
Shall I hold your hand in case you get frightened?

54:55.280 --> 54:56.280
Little Mai!

54:56.280 --> 54:58.280
Where are you?

54:58.280 --> 54:59.280
No!

54:59.280 --> 55:05.280
Stop it, please. You're frightening Snork maiden.

55:05.280 --> 55:06.280
Oh, really?

55:06.280 --> 55:07.280
I thought I was frightening you.

55:07.280 --> 55:09.280
Your voice is so shaky.

55:09.280 --> 55:12.280
This is the way I sound normally.

55:12.280 --> 55:14.280
Hey, be quiet.

55:14.280 --> 55:16.280
No.

55:16.280 --> 55:18.280
I can hear something.

55:18.280 --> 55:20.280
Me, too.

55:20.280 --> 55:22.280
Perhaps it's the wind.

55:22.280 --> 55:23.280
No, Snork maiden.

55:23.280 --> 55:25.280
It sounds like someone moaning.

55:25.280 --> 55:27.280
You can't scare me like that.

55:27.280 --> 55:28.280
No one lives here.

55:28.280 --> 55:29.280
Who want to live here anyway?

55:29.280 --> 55:31.280
It's dark and cold.

55:31.280 --> 55:33.280
It's moment and snuffkin.

55:33.280 --> 55:36.280
They've climbed down and we can hear their voices in the distance.

55:36.280 --> 55:38.280
So we needn't worry.

55:38.280 --> 55:39.280
Why would they be moaning?

55:39.280 --> 55:40.280
No.

55:40.280 --> 55:42.280
It's not them.

55:42.280 --> 55:45.280
I'm going to go and investigate.

55:49.280 --> 55:51.280
Don't, little Mai.

55:51.280 --> 55:53.280
Please, please stop it.

55:58.280 --> 56:02.280
Pull hard, Moomin.

56:02.280 --> 56:05.280
Will this do?

56:05.280 --> 56:07.280
Right, who's going first?

56:07.280 --> 56:08.280
Me.

56:08.280 --> 56:10.280
Okay, but please be careful.

56:10.280 --> 56:11.280
I will.

56:11.280 --> 56:18.280
Take it easy, Moomin.

56:18.280 --> 56:26.280
There's no hurry.

56:26.280 --> 56:29.280
Hey, are you alright, Moomin?

56:29.280 --> 56:33.280
Yes, of course.

56:33.280 --> 56:40.280
Oh, oh!

56:40.280 --> 56:47.280
Ah, ah, ah!

56:47.280 --> 56:51.280
Ah, ah, ah!

56:51.280 --> 56:56.280
Ah, ah, ah!

56:56.280 --> 57:02.280
Help me!

57:02.280 --> 57:05.280
Woman! What's happened? Talk to me!

57:05.280 --> 57:07.280
Woman! Are you all right?

57:07.280 --> 57:09.280
Oh, I don't know. I think so.

57:09.280 --> 57:11.280
My bottom's a little bit sore though.

57:11.280 --> 57:14.280
I'm sure I heard somebody scream just now.

57:14.280 --> 57:17.280
Well, the Himmelin was down here having a nap.

57:17.280 --> 57:18.280
The Himmelin?

57:18.280 --> 57:21.280
If this is another of your games, woman, I don't like it.

57:21.280 --> 57:24.280
Mr. Himmelin, we were climbing down from the top.

57:24.280 --> 57:25.280
We didn't know you were asleep.

57:25.280 --> 57:27.280
That's not quite right. I wasn't asleep.

57:27.280 --> 57:29.280
I wasn't the tall comfortable, you know.

57:29.280 --> 57:31.280
Well, what were you doing here then?

57:31.280 --> 57:36.280
Well, to tell you the truth, I really haven't been quite myself lately.

57:36.280 --> 57:40.280
You haven't lost any more rare stabs, have you, Mr. Himmelin?

57:40.280 --> 57:43.280
On the contrary, woman, I have them all.

57:43.280 --> 57:47.280
Even the rarest, every single one.

57:47.280 --> 57:50.280
Then what's wrong? That's good, isn't it?

57:50.280 --> 57:53.280
I mean, my collection is complete.

57:53.280 --> 57:58.280
No one in the world has a better stab collection than you have, Mr. Himmelin.

57:58.280 --> 58:02.280
No, of course not mine is perfect. There isn't a stab I haven't got.

58:02.280 --> 58:06.280
Rare ones, old ones, misprinted ones, I have them all.

58:06.280 --> 58:08.280
I still don't understand.

58:08.280 --> 58:10.280
There's no challenge, nothing to search for.

58:10.280 --> 58:13.280
You're too young and you don't collect stamps.

58:13.280 --> 58:15.280
Oh dear, me, dear me.

58:15.280 --> 58:18.280
I'm beginning to understand.

58:18.280 --> 58:22.280
He's not a collector anymore. He's got all the stamps he could ever want.

58:22.280 --> 58:26.280
That's the trouble. It's not half as much fun.

58:27.280 --> 58:31.280
That's why you're sad, isn't it, Mr. Himmelin?

58:31.280 --> 58:35.280
Yes it is. Don't fun. Don't fun at all.

58:35.280 --> 58:38.280
No, I understand. I can see why you're upset.

58:38.280 --> 58:41.280
And me falling on top of you like that did it really help, did it?

58:41.280 --> 58:45.280
Not exactly, Moomin.

58:45.280 --> 58:49.280
Look who was taking a nap in the cave.

58:49.280 --> 58:51.280
It's you, Mr. Himmelin.

58:51.280 --> 58:55.280
So it must have been his snoring that we heard. What a noise he was making.

58:56.280 --> 58:59.280
I'd never ever snore.

58:59.280 --> 59:02.280
You certainly do.

59:04.280 --> 59:11.280
Rubbish. Look, if you promise not to tell anyone, I'll take you to see something very special.

59:11.280 --> 59:13.280
What is it?

59:14.280 --> 59:17.280
Oh wait, it's not it.

59:17.280 --> 59:19.280
It's not it.

59:19.280 --> 59:21.280
It's not it.

59:21.280 --> 59:23.280
It's not it.

59:23.280 --> 59:25.280
It's not it.

59:25.280 --> 59:27.280
It's not it.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.280
It's not it.

59:29.280 --> 59:31.280
It's not it.

59:31.280 --> 59:33.280
I think it could be repaired.

59:33.280 --> 59:35.280
Of course it could. Easy.

59:35.280 --> 59:39.280
But you know you can't always tell. The keel doesn't look too good.

59:39.280 --> 59:42.280
Yes, we could take it out to see a no time.

59:42.280 --> 59:44.280
Sales got holes in it.

59:44.280 --> 59:47.280
Hey, I can't find any owners.

59:47.280 --> 59:50.280
You can pat a lost deer.

59:50.280 --> 59:53.280
Look out, friends. It's going over.

59:59.280 --> 01:00:03.280
Hey, hang on everybody.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:06.280
I've lost my confidence and it makes me feel very unhappy.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.280
Well, it can happen to anyone, you know.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.280
Even to you?

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.280
Well, not much, of course.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.280
Lucky you. I just don't know what to do.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.280
How can I get it back? There must be a way.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.280
It's hard to say.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:24.280
Everybody's different, but with me it just happens.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.280
Oh.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.280
I don't think I'll ever invent anything again.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.280
Perhaps I'll have a break from my memoirs, too.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.280
Tea time? Oh dear, what's the matter with you, too?

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.280
You look a bit down in the dunes.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.280
You know I might have been a bit overconfident.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.280
Me, too, I think.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.280
Oh, hi there.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:51.280
Mom, what's the matter with you, too?

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.280
You look a bit down in the dunes.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.280
You know I might have been a bit overconfident.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.280
Mum and Mama! Mum and Papa!

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.280
There's no need to yell. We can hear you. Watch the matter, Sniff.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:07.280
We found a boat on the beach. Come and have a look.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.280
A shipwreck washed up on the shore.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.280
It's not a wreck and it's got a white sail.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.280
Oh.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.280
We're going to repair it and then it'll be ours.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.280
All right, I'm coming. Come on, Snork.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.280
Let's take a look at this boat. It could be just the thing to cheer us both up.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.280
Oh, it's got a sail, a white sail, you say.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.280
That could be extremely interesting.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.280
It's a sturdy little craft. It's nicely built.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.280
Well designed.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.280
She's abandoned. So does that mean we can keep her?

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.280
It seems to be in pretty good condition except for the hole in the bottom.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.280
You know, maybe that's why she was abandoned here.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.280
You could be right, Sniffkin.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:59.280
Finders keepers, you guys. Of course it makes it our boat.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.280
You'd have to wait to see if anyone claims it first, little mind.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.280
What shall we do then, Papa?

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:11.280
Well, first things first, we must repair the hole and then tire up securely in case there's a storm.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.280
Absolutely.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:18.280
Then if the owner comes, we ought to give her back to him.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.280
Mind you, he might know she's here.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:26.280
So what are we going to do when we've repaired her?

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:31.280
It's bad for boats not to be yours, but we could sail the seven seas.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.280
I'd be happy just to explore around here.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:43.280
Don't worry, Snort Maiden. If we get big waves, we can sail between them, isn't that right?

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.280
Mom and Papa?

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:49.280
Well, in a way. Come on, let's get to work.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.280
How about you, Snort? Will you help us?

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.280
Yes, of course.

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.280
Can I do anything for you, Mum and Papa?

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.280
Yes, if you'd like to, Mr. Himmelon.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.280
Well, I'm afraid I'm not much of a builder, but if there is something I could do.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.280
Well, let's get her out of the water first, shall we?

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.280
Yeah, mom!

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.280
And we'll need some big logs to go under her.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.280
I think tin should be enough.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:17.280
I'll be too soon. Let's go, prom!

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:23.280
Yes, you'll need to be safe to work on, so we'll want something strong to keep her upright as well.

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.280
And lots of tools.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:30.280
I'll go home and get some, and I think we'll need a bucket and a shovel.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.280
I'll come with you, help you, tools.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:38.280
Yes, you go. I'll stay and keep guard in case the owner comes back.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.280
Sleep well.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.280
Man, the top sales.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.280
What?

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:21.280
Are they all in bed, my dear?

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.280
Yes, dear, sleeping like logs.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.280
I'm not surprised. They all work very, very hard today.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:31.280
I can't wait until the boat's ready, and we can sail off somewhere.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.280
My dear, we'll go anywhere in the world you like.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:38.280
Anywhere at all, you've only got to say enough, we'll jolly-will-go.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.280
It doesn't have to be far, dear.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.280
Let's get to bed, too. We've got an early start of the morning.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:50.280
Oh, intellectuals like me aren't used to this hard work.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:53.280
Oh, I'm tired out, and I can hardly move.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:56.280
Mama, I'd better put these tired legs to bed.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:00.280
Good night, dear Moomin, Papa. This would be good for him, I think.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:04.280
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:08.280
A perfect fit, if I may say so.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.280
Well, now for the rest of her.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.280
Right.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:16.280
Look at me, Moomin. I'm doing the Tari.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.280
I know, little Mai. I'm only doing where you can't reach.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.280
Oh, all right, then.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.280
Sniff you lazy land lever, bring me some more Tari.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:28.280
Hey, no, I won't. Get it yourself, you lazy thing.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.280
You wanted to do it.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:34.280
I didn't want to carry Tari, though. And anyway, I'm doing the Tari.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.280
I know, little Mai. I'm only doing where you can't reach.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:40.280
Oh, all right, then. Sniff you lazy land lever, bring me some more Tari.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.280
Tari, though. And anyway, I'm the painter.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.280
Come on, hurry up.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.280
Moomin, Mama, should I cut it all out?

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.280
Yes, please, not me.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.280
Hey, feeling all right, Mr. Hemmielin?

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:12.280
Yes, thank you. You're fixing the boat very quickly.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.280
Yeah, we sure are. I should be finished very soon.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.280
Yes, I'm sure it will.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:22.280
That's what I was afraid of. What shall I do then, Sniffkin?

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:25.280
Well, maybe you can start collecting something else. What you think?

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.280
Something else, like what?

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.280
Well, I don't know. Anything, really?

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.280
How about butterflies?

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:35.280
No, my second cousin does that, and he's a complete idiot.

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.280
It has to be something interesting.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.280
Ornements? Ornements?

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.280
Yeah, you could collect those forever.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.280
Not scientific.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:47.280
Well, it's up to you, but I think you really ought to collect something, Mr. Hemmielin.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:57.280
Mama! Mama!ed!

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.280
Mama, quick, hurry up. We're going to launch the new boat.

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.280
All right, wait for me. I'm coming.

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:08.280
The sail, you men, it is perfect, Mama. Come on!

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:14.280
Are you ready, everybody? I'll count to three, and then push as hard as you can.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:17.280
One, two, three!

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.280
Oh!

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.280
Oh!

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:37.280
And so, with their new boat finally repaired and uncleaned,

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:41.280
Moomin and the others began to get very excited about their trip around the world.

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:46.280
Even Snork and Mr. Hemmielin were in unusually high spirits.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.280
All aboard for a trial run.

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.280
I've decided what I'm going to collect.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:00.280
Flowers, look, here's my first sample. It's a sweet fryer, Rosa Robiganosa.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.280
That's great. Good for you.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:09.280
Snork, Maiden, I just had a new idea for my flying ship.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.280
I'm certain it'll work this time.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:14.280
Of course it will, Snork. Good luck.

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:19.280
I'd better get on. All right, start paddling, everyone.

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.280
We'll be back soon, my dear Moomin, Mama.

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:27.280
Take as long as you like, Papa. I'll prepare something cold for when you get back.

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.280
One, two, one, two.

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:34.280
Away, away, into the deep blue yonder.

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:38.280
One, two, one, two.

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:51.280
They love the laughter, and they love the living, the Moomin's.

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:58.280
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.280
They're always happy, and always at play.

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:09.280
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin'sed.

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:19.280
They love the laughter, and they love the living, the Moomin's.

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:27.280
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:31.280
They're always happy, and always at play.

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:38.280
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:48.280
The Moomin's, the Moomin's.

01:09:48.280 --> 01:10:10.280
Here they are for one and all.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.280
The Moomin's are about to call.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:16.280
Come on and sit down here with me.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:21.280
They're here for you on your TV. They are the Moomin's.

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.280
They are the Moomin's.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:27.280
So come with me, give me your hand.

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:30.280
I'll take you up to Moomin land.

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:33.280
You can fly just like a bird.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:36.280
Sing the best song ever.

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.280
They're with the Moomin's.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.280
They're with the Moomin's.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:53.280
They're with the Moomin's.

01:10:53.280 --> 01:11:03.280
They're with the Moomin's.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:13.280
They're with the Moomin's.

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:42.280
It was a lovely day, and Moomin, his family and friends,

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:47.280
decided to go for a trip in the boat they'd found washed up on the beach.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:53.280
They didn't know where they were going, and thought it would be much more fun that way.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:56.280
Mama, we're not going away forever, you know.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.280
I hope not.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.280
I don't think we'll need all these pots and pans.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.280
It's best to be prepared at sea.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.280
What do you mean?

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:06.280
Well, you'll only complain if you don't get a hot meal.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:07.280
I never complain.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:11.280
And you know how hungry the sea air made you all last timeed we went out on a boat.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.280
You would have been glad of food then.

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:16.280
Hmm, you got to rough it a bit if you wanted adventure.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:22.280
Yes, but it will be more fun with coffee and pancakes.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:33.280
Aren't you too ready yet?

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.280
Hello, Moomin.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.280
Hi, Snorkvagan.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:48.280
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.280
Must you use that ladder?

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.280
I'm all right.

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.280
Moomin, you're going to hurt yourself one of these days.

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.280
It's good practice.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.280
It's Snork coming with us.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:02.280
He says he hasn't got time for sailing boats at the moment.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:06.280
I'd much rather a real sailing boat than a paper flying ship any day.

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.280
Are Mama and Papa ready yet?

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.280
They're packing a path of kitchen.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:15.280
Oh, it's too full.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.280
Have we got to take all that with us?

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:21.280
Uh, Mama thinks it's better to be safe than sorry and she's usually right.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.280
Tell me, Moomin.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.280
Where exactly are we going?

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.280
We haven't decided yet.

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.280
That's right.

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.280
Wait and see.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.280
That's right.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:31.280
Wait and see.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:57.280
Mr. Hamulin.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.280
Mr. Hamulin.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.280
Have you found a rare plan for your collection yet?

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.280
Unfortunately not.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.280
There are lots of these in Moomin Valley already.

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.280
Goodness.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.280
Where are you taking all that?

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.280
We're going sailing.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:14.280
How exciting, charting new seas and exploring desert islands.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.280
Never know.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:21.240
If I help

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:33.280
Captain the bridge!

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:35.280
Mount the yard arm!

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.280
Hankers away!

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.280
Sailors beware!

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:40.280
Slice the manbrace!

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:42.280
All hands on deck!

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:44.280
Full speed ahead!

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.280
Hey, Sniff.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.280
Any sign of the movements?

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:47.280
Not yet.

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.280
It's a great day to go sailing.

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.280
I wonder where we're going.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.280
I don't have any idea.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.280
I don't actually like sailing.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.280
Do you get sick?

01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.280
Well, not really sick.

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.280
It's just that I can't swim.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:03.280
And if it's rough, it frightens me and I panic a bit.

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.280
It looks like it's going to stay calm.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:06.280
So don't worry.

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.280
Right.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.280
That's the lot.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.280
Now, all aboard.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.280
Mama, little Mai, Sniffkin, Moomin, Snork Maiden,

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.280
and Mr. Hamulin.

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.280
It looks like it's going to stay calm.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.280
So don't worry.

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.280
Right.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.280
That's the lot.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.280
Now, all aboard.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:24.280
Mama, little Mai, Sniffkin, Moomin, Snork Maiden,

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.280
and Mr. Hamulin of course.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.280
Isn't he a bit old for adventures?

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.280
Not at all.

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.280
No, Moomin Papa has promised to find a deserted island

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.280
where I shall search for rare plants.

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.280
No, no, no, no, no.

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:49.280
Come on, Sniff, hurry up.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.280
There's no room.

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.280
Don't be silly, Sniff.

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.280
Of course there is.

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:58.280
It looks very full, almost thinking.

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.280
There's no way this boat could sink.

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.280
Now, come on, get him.

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.280
Oh.

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:07.280
Really?

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.280
I promise it'll be all right.

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.280
Won't it, Papa?

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:13.280
Well, if it stays like this, it will, Moomin.

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.280
I'll come next time.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.280
Let's go, Moomin Papa.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.280
He's just a scary cat.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.280
We'll go without you then, Sniff.

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.280
I think that will be best.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.280
Anyway, someone had better stay and look after Moomin House

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.280
and it might just as well be me.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.280
That's very thoughtful of you.

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.280
There's a pancake on the kitchen table

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:35.280
that you can have for lunch.

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.280
Thank you, Moomin Papa.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.280
Have a nice trip.

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.280
I wish Sniff had come.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.280
He's a big softy.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.280
Well, he's not very good at swimming

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.280
and he does eat rather a lot.

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.280
This is a life, isn't it, Mama?

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.280
It certainly is, dear.

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:25.280
Oh, look, not a breath of wind.

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.280
Shall I start rolling, Papa?

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.280
Yes, you'd better get Sniffkin to help you.

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.280
Aye-aye, Captain.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.280
It's hardly moving.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.280
You'll have to do better than that.

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:40.280
We're doing our best.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.280
You too, Papa.

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.280
We're doing our best.

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.280
We're doing our best.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.280
We're doing our best.

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:48.280
We're doing our best.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.280
We're doing our best.

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:53.280
You too would be useless as galley slaves.

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:55.280
It's good that we're not then, isn't it?

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.280
So then, what's your excuse?

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.280
It's not easy rolling against the tide.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.280
You try it.

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.280
No, dear, at this rate, I should be lucky to find one rare plant.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:09.280
Well, Mr. Hamlin, you could always try collecting some seaweed instead.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.280
There's plenty of that.

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.280
I have heard tales that if you whistle,

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:16.280
those who perished at sea will send you a wind.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:21.280
Land! Hoi! Look, Moomin, Papa!

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.280
That's too small to be any good.

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.280
You're right.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:37.280
Hey, look, Papa. We're moving again.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.280
The tide's turned and the winds up.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.280
What a beautiful island!

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.280
And a perfect place to land, too.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:51.280
Oh, I bet this place has got some rare plants.

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:53.280
We'll be careful.

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:54.280
We'll be careful.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.280
We'll be careful.

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.280
We'll be careful.

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.280
We'll be careful.

01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:58.280
We'll be careful.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:01.280
Oh, I bet this place has got some rare plants.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.280
We'll be careful when you explore.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.280
There could be wild animals there.

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.280
Now, if someone will go and collect some wood,

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.280
I'll get a fire started.

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.280
I bet none of you will say no to coffee and pancakes.

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.280
Watch me, you land lovers.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.280
I'll go and pull the boat ashore.

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:32.280
Hmm, I suppose you were right.

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:33.280
This will come in handy.

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.280
As I said, Papa, it's always better to rough it

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.280
with a little bit of luxury.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:40.280
I wonder if we're the first to set foot on the island.

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.280
Thank you, children.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.280
Is there anything else you want us to do?

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.280
No, I don't think so.

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.280
Is it okay if I go explore the island?

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.280
Of course, off you go.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.280
Coming, snort, Maida.

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.280
I'll stay and help Moomin Mama with the cooking.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.280
Mama, you said we needed firewood.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:01.280
Is this enough?

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:03.280
My goodness for a lot.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:10.280
You know, I don't think anyone lives on this island.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:14.280
I haven't seen anyone unless they're hiding in the bushes.

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.280
I've seen someone.

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:17.280
Oh yeah?

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.280
Who?

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.280
Well, they weren't very big.

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:21.280
What do you mean, this big?

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.280
Well, same as me.

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:24.280
What did they look like?

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:27.080
Sort of white and ghostly and not very friendly looking

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.080
either, Moomin.

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:31.080
Well, you probably just thought you saw something a little mic.

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.080
I did see them.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.080
I did too.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.080
Keep your hair on.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.080
I'm not saying you didn't see anything.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:43.080
Goodness, this is magnificent.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.080
Oh, what a find.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.080
And what's this?

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.080
Well, well, well.

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.080
I've never seen such rare and beautiful plants.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.080
Oh.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.080
Well, what's this?

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.080
Goodness, it's a perimeter.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.080
Now, let's see.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.080
Rain and storm.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.080
Probably broken.

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.080
Oh, hello.

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:56.080
Who are you?

01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:57.080
Oh, I see.

01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.080
This is your perimeter, isn't it?

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.080
Now, watch it.

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:02.080
Mind you don't travel on those flowers, will you?

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.080
Oh, no, no, no.

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.080
They're coming to get me.

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.080
Don't go away.

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.080
Don't go away.

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:17.080
I think what little my saw was a hatty fatter.

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.080
They're not ghosts.

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.080
Are they snuffkin?

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.080
No, they look kind of like it,

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:24.080
but they're really harmless enough, Moomin.

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.080
Oh, leave me alone.

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.080
Oh, dear.

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.080
What on earth was that?

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.080
It sounded like Mr. Himulet.

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.080
Don't get away.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.080
Oh, help me, please.

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.080
That's it.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.080
That's what I saw.

01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.080
It's Mr. Himulet.

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.080
Help!

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:01.080
Get me down.

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.080
Why are they after you, Mr. Himulet?

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:04.080
What'd you do to them?

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.080
I don't know.

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.080
I just tapped on this post,

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.080
and asked them to be careful with the flowers.

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.080
They seem a bit angry to me.

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:14.080
Oh, then I tapped on them.

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.080
Oh, no, no, no.

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.080
I just tapped on this post,

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.080
and asked them to be careful with the flowers.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.080
Is that ours?

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.080
They seem a bit angry to me.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.080
Oh, then I tapped on them.

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.080
Oh, then I tapped on the morometer

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.080
to check the weather, and they came at me.

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:28.080
Well, I don't think it's a flower's a mad about.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.080
Maybe they thought you were trying to steal the morometer.

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.080
I don't want it to keep it.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:36.080
My goodness, I'm collecting flowers, not the morometers.

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:38.080
Well, hang on.

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:40.080
I can't hang on much longer.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.080
Hurry, please.

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:43.080
They don't look so easily frightened.

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.080
No, now let me think.

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:48.080
Hurry, I'm slipping.

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.080
I've got it, Mr. Himulet.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:55.080
The hadifatners can't see or hear very well,

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.080
but they are very sensitive.

01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.080
We'll have to try and frighten them.

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:02.080
I suggest you shake the post as hard as you can.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.080
Like this.

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.080
Harder.

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:09.080
Harder, Mr. Himulet.

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.080
Look, they can feel the ground moving.

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:15.080
Keep going, Mr. Himulet.

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:19.080
I'm getting really tired.

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.080
They're not going.

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:25.080
Are you sure this will work?

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:44.080
You can stop now, Mr. Himulet.

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:47.080
Mr. Himulet.

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:50.080
Hey, are you all right, Mr. Himulet?

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:53.080
What is disgusting creatures?

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:56.080
I have a good mind to take their precious barometer.

01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:59.080
I don't think that's such a good idea.

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:02.080
It's no good anyway, it's not working.

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:05.080
How do you know that, Mr. Himulet?

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:08.080
Look, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:12.080
According to this barometer, it should be pouring down with rain.

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:18.080
This is the way to explore real home cooking.

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:20.080
It just takes a little thought.

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:24.080
And woman papa is always prepared, aren't you dear?

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:28.080
Double zero, it can't get any lower than that.

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.080
What does that mean?

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:33.080
If it was working, it would mean being for a terrible storm.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:39.080
I think the reading might be right after all, Mr. Himulet.

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:43.080
See the way the sky is darkening.

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.080
Look at those storm clouds.

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:52.080
We better go before it's too late.

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.080
But there won't be time to get home.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.080
We'll be shipwreck moving, papa.

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.080
Surely there's still time.

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:01.080
We don't want to go back to moving valley yet.

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:04.080
We've only explored half the island.

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:07.080
Besides, you never know what we might find, Snort Maiden.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:10.080
I wanted to get my hands on those happy fat nurse.

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:13.080
That's the last thing I wanted to do, little mind. The very last.

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.080
I think we ought to leave now.

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.080
What do you think, mama?

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:20.080
Well, you're the captain, dear. It's up to you.

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.080
So I am. Now, let me think.

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:40.080
All right, we'll stay.

01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:41.080
Oh, can we?

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:44.080
Yes, but we must put the tent up before it starts raining.

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:45.080
What tent?

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:49.080
Always be prepared. That's my motto.

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:52.080
You're very clever to think of everything.

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:58.080
First, we must lower the sails and pull the boat up so that she's out of harm's way.

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:01.080
Yes, but we must put the tent up before it starts raining.

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.080
What tent?

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:05.080
Always be prepared. That's my motto.

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:08.080
The boat up so that she's out of harm's way.

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.080
That should do it.

01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:31.080
Well done, everybody. It should be safe here.

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:35.080
Now, hurry with the tent. The storm's nearly here.

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.080
Are you all right, Mr. Himulan?

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.080
You stay here and rest.

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:43.080
We'll manage without you.

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.080
I am a bit tired.

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:50.080
You get your breath back first, but don't forget to tie the boat to that tree before you come up.

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:53.080
It looks bad. A real humdinger.

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.080
You can trust me.

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.080
Right, let's get that tent up.

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:02.080
Oh, dear, what a day.

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:18.080
Oh, what's this here?

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:25.080
Oh, yes.

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:29.080
Well, fans, see that I've never seen one of these before.

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:37.080
It's not good.

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.080
What's happening?

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.080
It's coming really fast. Look at the rain over the sea.

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:48.080
We're going to get soaked if we stay here.

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.080
Just a minute.

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.080
But we'll get wet.

01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:54.080
I know, but it's so exciting.

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.080
Things which you have no control over.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.080
You can see this great big storm coming towards you.

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:02.080
And you can't do anything about it.

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.080
No.

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.080
You have to time it just right.

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.080
When to make a run for shelter, you mean?

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.080
I knew you'd understand.

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.080
I wonder what the Hattie Fatterners are doing.

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:23.080
Waiting for the thunderstorm.

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.080
Why?

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:28.080
Because they get energy from the electricity and the lightning.

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:29.080
Really?

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.080
That's it.

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:32.080
Come on.

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.080
I've never seen rain like this.

01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:54.080
I've never seen enough, Momen.

01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.080
You're dressed, Mom.

01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.080
I know.

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:02.080
It's all right.

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:03.080
I'll look after you.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.080
I know.

01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:24.080
I know.

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:25.080
I know.

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:26.080
I know.

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:27.080
I know.

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.080
I know.

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.080
I know.

01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:30.080
I know.

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:31.080
I know.

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.080
I know.

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:33.080
I know.

01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:34.080
I know.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.080
I know.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.080
I know.

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.080
I know.

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.080
I know.

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.080
I know.

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:40.080
I know.

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:41.080
I know.

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:42.080
I know.

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:43.080
I know.

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.080
I know.

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:45.080
I know.

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:46.080
I know.

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.080
I know.

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:48.080
I know.

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:49.080
I know.

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:50.080
I know.

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.080
I know.

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.080
I know.

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.080
I know.

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.080
I know.

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:55.080
I know.

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.080
I know.

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.080
I know.

01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:58.080
I know.

01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:59.080
I know.

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:00.080
That was a close one.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.080
Too close.

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.080
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:06.080
What a find I made today.

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:08.080
What a find I made today.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.080
What a find I made today.

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:22.080
What a find I made today.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:25.080
What you find It was I made today.

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:28.080
What a find I made today.

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.080
What a find I made today.

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:31.080
What a find Hai.

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:33.080
What a find I made today.

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:35.080
What the see my time is.

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:38.080
What you can do is wait until it's blown itself out.

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:42.080
But what if the waves are so high that your boat is caught up

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.080
and washed out to sea?

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:47.080
That is a different story altogether.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:53.080
What if the waves are so high that your boat is caught up?

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:21.080
They're always happy and always at play.

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:25.080
The movements are having fun day after day.

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:29.080
The movements.

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:33.080
The movements.

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:36.080
They love the laughter and they love the living.

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:40.080
The movements.

01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:47.080
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:51.080
They're always happy and always at play.

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:55.080
The movements are having fun day after day.

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:58.080
The movements.

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:02.080
The movements.

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:08.080
The movements.

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:14.080
The movements.

01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:44.080
They are the movements.

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:47.080
So come with me, give me your hand.

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:50.080
I'll take you up to a moment land.

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:53.080
You can fly just like a bird.

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.080
Sing the bass song ever.

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:58.080
There were the movements.

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:01.080
There were the movements.

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:04.080
There were the movements.

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:07.080
There were the movements.

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:10.080
There were the movements.

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:13.080
There were the movements.

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.080
There were the movements.

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:43.080
There were the movements.

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:46.080
The movements.

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:13.080
Papa, I think that rope is getting loose.

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.080
Okay, movement.

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:18.080
You'd better have a look before this wind has the whole tent down.

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:21.080
The eye, Captain.

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:25.080
A sudden storm has hit the hafifat in this island.

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:35.080
The movement, Papa, has decided that it would be far safer to stay the night on the island.

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:39.080
So they put up the tent and moored the boat.

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.080
This will show us what the weather's up to.

01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.080
That's as long as it's still working.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.080
I'm sure it's going to die down really soon.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:58.080
Oh, wake up, Mr. Hemelon.

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:03.080
When the storm clears, we must give this barometer straight back to the hafifat in this.

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:07.080
Oh, I quite fancy keeping it myself to remind me of the island.

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:10.080
You know, it seems to work after all.

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:14.080
But Mr. Hemelon, that'll only remind you of the horrible hafifat in this.

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:17.080
What about all the tons of plants you found?

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:20.080
That surely is going to be enough?

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:26.080
Yes, I know, but there was only really one special flower amongst all those plants, and I nearly missed that one.

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.080
Look, isn't it a beauty?

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.080
I discovered it as I was about to tie up the boat.

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:34.080
Oh, woman, Papa.

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:36.080
Yes, Mr. Hemelon.

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:42.080
You know, when you all went to put up the tent, you told me to tie up the boat so she was safe.

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.080
Yes, of course.

01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:47.080
Well, I'm not sure if I did.

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:49.080
Not sure at all.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:53.080
Please try to remember, Mr. Hemelon.

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:57.080
I can't. It's all very unclear in my mind.

01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:01.080
If the boat's not here, we'll be stuck on the island forever and ever.

01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:07.080
Oh, we pulled it well ashore, so it should be okay, but we'd better check on it as soon as we can.

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.080
I'll go have a look.

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:12.080
Quickly, moment. Be careful.

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:17.080
I remember I was just going to do it when I spotted this flower.

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:20.080
Just by a rocket was whole dear.

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:24.080
Woman.

01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:39.080
Boy, that was close.

01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:44.080
Tie it to the tree and make sure it's tight.

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.080
That should do it.

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:48.080
Just in time.

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:51.080
You know, the waves must have been huge to reach this far.

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:53.080
Well, we saved the boat.

01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:55.080
Yes.

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:59.080
Well, this storm will be over soon.

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:07.080
Is everything okay?

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:09.080
Yep. Everything's fine.

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:13.080
Oh, thank goodness. So we're not stranded after all.

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:15.080
Huh? No.

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:17.080
We needn't have worried.

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:21.080
I'm very sorry. Really, I am.

01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:26.080
Are you all right, Snort Maiden? Now I am.

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:46.080
According to this, the storm is blowing over now and it should stop raining soon.

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:48.080
Well, the wind seems to have dropped.

01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:52.080
Oh, good. All that thunder and lightning is so noisy.

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:58.080
Ah, right. I think I'll just go for a bit of a walk before I settle down for the night.

01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:01.080
But it's much too dark to see anything.

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:05.080
The fresh air will do me good.

01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:11.080
Oh, ah! That's a good idea. I could do with some fresh air myself.

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:14.080
Wait for me. I'll come too.

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:16.080
Let me increase the water.

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:19.080
There's still there hundreds of them all glowing.

01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.080
The hatty fat nurse.

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:24.080
They're waiting for us.

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:35.080
The lightning must have recharged them.

01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:41.080
Look at them all. I wonder what they want, Snort Maiden.

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:45.080
Such a heavy storm would have given them lots and lots of energy.

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.080
Gosh, they're ready for anything.

01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:50.080
They're not coming any closer.

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:53.080
They seem fairly friendly. Maybe they just want to see what we look like.

01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:55.080
No, I know what they're here for.

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.080
Oh, what's that, Snuffkin?

01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:59.080
It's their barometer, Moomin Papa.

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:04.080
They know we've got it and they've come to get it back from us.

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:07.080
Yes, I think you're right, Snuffkin.

01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:09.080
Mr. Hamilton?

01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:12.080
I do think you'd better give it back to them.

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:14.080
Do I have to?

01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:20.080
Yes, of course. After all it is there isn't there are a lot of them.

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:25.080
Look, why don't you take it out to them now?

01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:33.080
You know the barometer does belong to the Mr. Hamilton.

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:37.080
Oh, dear, dear. Give it to me.

01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.080
Let me do it, Papa.

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:43.080
Well done, my boy.

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:46.080
You must be careful, my dear.

01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:48.080
Don't worry, Mama.

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.080
My boy isn't he brave.

01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:17.080
I think this is what you've come for.

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:21.080
Here you are. You can have it back now.

01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:24.080
Moomin!

01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:34.080
Moomin!

01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:37.080
Moomin! Are you all right, Moomin?

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:40.080
I'll tell you something. I'm real glad there's no electricity where we live.

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:43.080
Oh, they didn't hurt you, did they?

01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:45.080
Ah! Go away!

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:48.080
They were alone.

01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:51.080
Are you all right, Snuffkin?

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:55.080
I'll tell you something. I'm real glad there's no electricity where we live.

01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:58.080
Oh, they didn't hurt you, did they?

01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:01.080
Ah! Go away!

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:04.080
Are you all right, Snuffkin?

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:06.080
What did he do to you?

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:09.080
Just a bit of shock, that's all.

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:13.080
What's that funny smell?

01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:16.080
Oh, my god, it's your hair.

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:19.080
What do you mean?

01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:21.080
What's happened to it?

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:24.080
Oh, no, my hair, Mama, Mama!

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:27.080
Where's your mirror? Oh, Mama!

01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:32.080
Oh, look at what those wicked, hatty fat owners have done.

01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.080
It's here in my handbag somewhere.

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:39.080
Hurry, Mama! I must see what's happened to my hair!

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:42.080
Here you are, dear.

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:47.080
Look at me! Look at me! It's awful!

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:49.080
It's horrible! It's horrible!

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:53.080
Don't worry, we'll put some magic ointment on and it'll come back all lovely and curly.

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:56.080
I don't want nasty curly hair.

01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:00.080
I want my long, beautiful hair like it was before.

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:08.080
You know, it really doesn't matter to me, Snuffkin.

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:18.080
God, oh, good. I hope that's the last we see of them.

01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:22.080
Oh, dear, what's happened to Snuffkin?

01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:30.080
My hair, my hair, where's my hair?

01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:58.080
Oh, dear, what's happened to Snuffkin?

01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:03.080
Oh, dear, what's happened to Snuffkin?

01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:07.080
Oh, dear, what's happened to Snuffkin?

01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:12.080
Oh, dear, what's happened to Snuffkin?

01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:16.080
Oh, dear, what's happened to Snuffkin?

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:21.080
Oh, dear, what's happened to Snuffkin?

01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:28.080
Snuffkin!

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:33.080
Snuffkin!

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:58.080
Wake up, woman. We've got to hurry.

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:16.080
I wonder where they're going.

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:19.080
Perhaps they're saving a way to a secret island.

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:26.080
Somewhere very far away from here where they can live happily on their own together.

01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:30.080
Gosh, Snuffkin, they're really weird.

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:33.080
Well, it depends on how you look at it, woman.

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:40.080
They probably think we're a bit strange, too.

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:47.080
Snuffkin, you're really horrible. You knew I wanted to see them.

01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:51.080
Come on, you were fast asleep, snoring your head off.

01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:55.080
That wasn't me snoring that was Mr. Him you went.

01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:58.080
All right, if you say so.

01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:01.080
Well, I hope that's the last I'll see of them.

01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:05.080
Me, too. That's a very pretty scarf, Snort Maidum.

01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:08.080
Yes, it is, isn't it?

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:12.080
Can we go exploring, Mama?

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:14.080
I don't see why not.

01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:20.080
It looks as though it'll be a nice day and there'll be lots of exciting things washed up by the storm.

01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:24.080
Oh, that'll be fun. Let's look for the other side of the island.

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:28.080
What a good idea. I might discover some more plants.

01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:46.080
Mr. Himmelin, hurry up, sir. Or it will be dark before we get there.

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:51.080
You go on, Momen. I just want to have a better look at these flowers.

01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:55.080
Yes, all right.

01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:59.080
Very interesting.

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:04.080
Just think we could find all sorts of things lying on the sand.

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:07.080
I hope it's secrets, sunken treasure.

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:09.080
Well, let's hope it's not sunken anymore.

01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:13.080
I expect there'll be lots and lots of treasures from shipwrecks and things like that.

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.080
But I find it before you.

01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:20.080
Oh, no, you won't.

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:28.080
Look at all this. It's all mine.

01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:32.080
I'm going to die, really.

01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:35.080
What's that over there?

01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:38.080
It's quite shallow right here.

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:41.080
Well, there must be something admit it.

01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:43.080
Oh, dear. It's empty.

01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:47.080
I think I found something here.

01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:52.080
Little lie, little lie.

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:55.080
What's the matter?

01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:58.080
Come and see these beautiful shells I have.

01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:02.080
I'm too busy hunting for treasure to bother with shells.

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:11.080
Hey, what's this?

01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:14.080
What?

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:19.080
Oh, look at this one.

01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:22.080
I've got a real collection here.

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.080
Got a lovely mama's garden.

01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:33.080
Wow, watch that.

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.080
What?

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:39.080
I can't find any as nice as yours.

01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:42.080
Don't be in such an awful hurry, little lie.

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:45.080
Snark maiden, snark maiden.

01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:47.080
Look, look what I found.

01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:49.080
A proper treasure.

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:52.080
Look.

01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:57.080
Oh, there's snow inside of it.

01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:59.080
I found it in a cave.

01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:02.080
What is it?

01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:04.080
What's this?

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:06.080
It's a ship telescope.

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:08.080
You can see for miles with it.

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:10.080
I'll give it to Papa.

01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:15.080
It's better than anything I got.

01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:16.080
Hey, everybody.

01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.080
I found something.

01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:21.080
Come on up and have a look.

01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:25.080
I wish I could find something interesting.

01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:31.080
Have you found some buried treasure?

01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:37.080
What a big lady.

01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:39.080
Is she dead?

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:41.080
It's made of wood, Snark maiden.

01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:45.080
It's a figurehead from a ship.

01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:57.080
She's like a queen.

01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:01.080
Ha, she hasn't got any legs though.

01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:05.080
Why don't we put her on the front of our boat?

01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:07.080
Nah, it's much too heavy.

01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:10.080
It must have come from a ship that was wrecked.

01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:13.080
And Sank had seen?

01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:16.080
Perhaps it did.

01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:18.080
And all hands were lost.

01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:20.080
I want to take it home.

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:22.080
What would you do with it?

01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:26.080
Use her to frighten people away.

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:31.080
Help! Somebody help me!

01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:34.080
That's old Mr. Himmelin.

01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:37.080
Gosh, I hope it's not more haddy fattiners.

01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:39.080
Someone help, please.

01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:41.080
We're coming.

01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:53.080
Woman, why do you like this old figurehead so much?

01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:55.080
You're staring at her.

01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:57.080
She's not all that special, you know?

01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:59.080
Yes, I know.

01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:01.080
She's not even real.

01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:04.080
Only made of wood.

01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:07.080
Do you like her eyes?

01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:09.080
Or is it her hair?

01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:12.080
Just because I haven't got any?

01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:14.080
Nearly there, just a bit further.

01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:17.080
Come on, snuff it for me.

01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:20.080
For her to want.

01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:24.080
You're very heavy, Mr. Himmelin.

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:26.080
Thank you, snuff kid.

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:28.080
You saved my life.

01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:30.080
Oh!

01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:33.080
Boy, how'd you end up there, Mr. Himmelin?

01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:38.080
One minute, I was looking for plants the next I'd fallen right into that hole.

01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:41.080
I think you'd be safe for collecting stamps, Mr. Himmelin.

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:45.080
Oh no, it's not here. Where is it?

01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:48.080
What is it now?

01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:50.080
Tell me.

01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:52.080
Make a move and preserve me.

01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:56.080
Calm down, Mr. Himmelin. Tell me what's the matter?

01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:00.080
My sample box, my sample box, oh my goodness.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:03.080
You didn't leave it in the hole, did you?

01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:06.080
Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you, oh dear.

01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:09.080
All my precious samples, I'm so silly.

01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:11.080
Oh, snuff kid.

01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:16.080
Oh, snuff kid, would you mind?

01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:19.080
Okay, anything for some peace.

01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:21.080
Oh dear boy, you are wonderful.

01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:24.080
You shall have one of my rarest plants as a reward.

01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:28.080
And he, you shall, I shall choose a magnificent one for you.

01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:30.080
Thank you very much, Mr. Himmelin.

01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:33.080
Gosh, you're one of her movements.

01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:38.080
Oh, there you are. What have you been up to?

01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:43.080
He can't take his eyes off that silly wooden lady. He just dares at her.

01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:44.080
Really?

01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:48.080
I do not. I just think she has a very beautiful face.

01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:53.080
Well, woman, now that you're here, I could really do with your help.

01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:55.080
What do you want, snuff kid?

01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:59.080
Mr. Himmelin dropped his box of samples down this hole and I'm going to try and get it.

01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:04.080
I didn't drop it, I fell in the hole and just forgot it when stuff can pull me out.

01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:06.080
You're a bit absent-minded, Mr. Himmelin.

01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:11.080
No, I'm not, I can remember every Latin name of every single plant, you know.

01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:15.080
Okay, I'll go down, woman, but you'll have to help me get back up.

01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:16.080
Okay.

01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:19.080
I'll help you too, now be careful.

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:21.080
Can you see it yet, snuff kid?

01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:23.080
I'm not down at the bottom yet.

01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:25.080
Oh, forgive me, I'm sorry.

01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:27.080
I found it.

01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:30.080
Wonderful, tell me, are the plants all right?

01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:33.080
You can check them yourself in a minute.

01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:42.080
Are you all right, snuff kid?

01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:45.080
Wait a minute, I found something else.

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:48.080
Oh, look!

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:49.080
There's the boat.

01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:52.080
It's Mom and Mom and Mom and Papa.

01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:54.080
Hello.

01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:00.080
It's gold.

01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:03.080
Hello, we've been hunting treasure.

01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:09.080
Go and get Mom and Papa, I found gold.

01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:12.080
Boy, oh boy, I wonder how much there is.

01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:14.080
Mum and Papa will know.

01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:28.080
Well, Mum and Papa, what should we do with all this beautiful gold?

01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:31.080
It would look lovely in the garden, don't you think?

01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:36.080
With all the shells that the snorkemaiden found, they'll look good in amongst the roses.

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:38.080
What do you think, Mama?

01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:40.080
I'm sure they will, Papa.

01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:41.080
I'm sure they will.

01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:47.080
Mum, she's only a stupid, legless doll.

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:51.080
You can have my bowl full of snorkemaiden.

01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:53.080
No thanks.

01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:55.080
Well, I'll look after it for you.

01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:58.080
I can pretend it's my treasure.

01:54:58.080 --> 01:54:59.080
Oh.

01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:08.080
And that was the end of their first adventure in the new boat.

01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:14.080
Mum and Papa decided that it was much more fun to set off without maps and sea charts.

01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:17.080
You never know where you might end up.

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:29.080
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:36.080
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:40.080
They're always happy and always at play.

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:43.080
The movements are having fun day after day.

01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:47.080
The movements.

01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:51.080
The movements.

01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:58.080
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:05.080
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:09.080
They're always happy and always at play.

01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:13.080
The movements are having fun day after day.

01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:16.080
The movements.

01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:20.080
The movements.

01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:26.080
The movements.

01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:46.080
The movements.

01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:49.080
Here they are for one and all.

01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:52.080
The movements are about to come.

01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:55.080
Come on and sit down here with me.

01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:00.080
There for you on your TV they are the movements.

01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:03.080
They are the movements.

01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:06.080
Don't come with me give me your hand.

01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:09.080
I'll take you up to a moment land.

01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:12.080
You can fly just like a bird.

01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:14.080
Sing that song ever.

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:17.080
There were the movements.

01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:20.080
There were the movements.

01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:23.080
There were the movements.

01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:26.080
There were the movements.

01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:29.080
There were the movements.

01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:32.080
There were the movements.

01:57:32.080 --> 01:58:02.080
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:38.080
Oh, oh!

01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:39.080
Moments!

01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:43.080
Hello, is love for me?

01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:51.080
A letter for the ladies!

01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:54.080
He's gonna fall in this time.

01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:55.080
What?

01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:56.080
Come on.

01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:57.080
This way, towards me.

01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:58.080
Come on.

01:58:58.080 --> 01:58:59.080
Come on!

01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:01.080
Oh!

01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:02.080
Oh!

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:03.080
I got him!

01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:04.080
Did you dig that hole?

01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:05.080
Yeah!

01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:06.080
No, weren't, didn't it?

01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:09.080
All right.

01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:11.080
Who's responsible for this?

01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:13.080
Are you all right?

01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:16.080
Did you dig this hole, young woman?

01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:17.080
Of course not.

01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:18.080
Who was it then?

01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:28.080
Hi, you, I should have known.

01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:30.080
Come here, you just wait.

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:32.080
Uh, hold on, Mr. Postman.

01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:33.080
Can I help my letter, please?

01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:35.080
Just do wait.

01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:54.080
Here's the letter, mama.

01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:55.080
Hmm?

01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:57.080
A goodness, a letter.

01:59:57.080 --> 01:59:59.080
I think it's from mumble.

01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:00.080
Oh, really?

02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:04.080
Where's little my, moment?

02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:05.080
Well, she's um...

02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:08.080
So, who's this letter from?

02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:11.080
It's from my sister mumble, isn't it?

02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:12.080
Oh, should I know?

02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:14.080
She went on holiday to get away from me.

02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:18.080
I bet she's coming back because she's missed all the fun.

02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:20.080
She'd stay away if she had it in a sense.

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:23.080
This is the third time I've fallen into a hole.

02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:25.080
Yes, I know.

02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:29.080
But this is only the first time I've seen you do it.

02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:32.080
What a horrible little child you are.

02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:33.080
Artite!

02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:34.080
Whoop!

02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:35.080
Whoop, that was close!

02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:37.080
Go on, fall off!

02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:38.080
Whoop!

02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:40.080
Whoop!

02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:41.080
Whoop!

02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:42.080
Whoop!

02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:43.080
Whoop!

02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:44.080
Whoop!

02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:45.080
Whoop!

02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:47.080
Mumble says that she's coming back.

02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:50.080
She feels that she's ready to cope with little my again.

02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:52.080
Oh, that's good news, moment, mama.

02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:56.080
I think that we should go and give her house a good clean.

02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:59.080
Have you told little my now mumble's coming?

02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:00.080
She'll be able to go home.

02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:04.080
No, I expect the postman is still chasing her around the garden.

02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:08.080
Don't tell me why I don't want to know.

02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:11.080
Mama!

02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:12.080
Mama!

02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:14.080
Is the letter from mumble?

02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:15.080
What does she have to say?

02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:17.080
Is she coming home?

02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:23.080
And a few days later, mumble returned to Mum and Valley.

02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:30.080
Now, mumble is a lot bigger and prettier than little my.

02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:33.080
And what's more, she's a lot quieter.

02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:37.080
That's Mum and Valley!

02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:38.080
Over there!

02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:41.080
It's not full of creepy crawlies, is it?

02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:43.080
Not as far as I knowed.

02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:46.080
Is there a house over there?

02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:48.080
Maybe they have food, let's go.

02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:50.080
Oh, that's Mum and House.

02:01:56.080 --> 02:01:58.080
Are you going to Mum and Valley, too?

02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:02.080
Yes, we thought we would.

02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:04.080
That's nice, so am I.

02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:05.080
We can go together.

02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:09.080
Your suitcase looks very heavy.

02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:11.080
Would you like a hand with me?

02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.080
Oh, no!

02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:15.080
Okay.

02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:19.080
Are they nice to people that live in that house?

02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:21.080
Yes, they are.

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:22.080
Could we stay there?

02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:24.080
I'm sure you can.

02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:26.080
My little sister is staying with them.

02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:28.080
Follow me, I know the way, shall we go?

02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:35.080
What's the matter?

02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:36.080
Nothing.

02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:37.080
We'll follow you.

02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:38.080
All right.

02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:43.080
Mum!

02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:48.080
Mum!

02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:54.080
Hello.

02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:55.080
How are you?

02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:56.080
Fine, you.

02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:57.080
Fine.

02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:59.080
Do you have a nice rest without me?

02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:01.080
Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.

02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:06.080
Oh, by the way, I'm at two very small strangers

02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:08.080
who said they were coming here.

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:10.080
Coming here, mumble?

02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:13.080
Yes, they're both the same size as little mine.

02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:18.080
Both a bit odd and they're carrying a very large suitcase.

02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:22.080
Right, I'd better make them up a small double bed then.

02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:24.080
Thanks for the tea.

02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:27.080
Now, are you ready to come home with me now, little mine?

02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:28.080
No, not yet.

02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:31.080
We've got to go home and tidy the house.

02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:33.080
It hasn't been aired for the whole winter.

02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:35.080
It's all right, mumble.

02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:37.080
I cleaned and swept the floors the other day

02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:39.080
and opened all the doors and windows.

02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:42.080
Thank you very much.

02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:44.080
It must have been a relief to be asleep most of the time

02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:46.080
with the mice been staying with you.

02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:49.080
They said they haven't been bored once since we woke up

02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:52.080
and we've had a really good time together.

02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:54.080
Isn't that right, Mum?

02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:59.080
Bye now.

02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:02.080
Well, well.

02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:05.080
What does well, well, me, Papa?

02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:09.080
Just that I might be able to hear myself think again now.

02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:11.080
I know what you mean.

02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:19.080
You're not thingin' me.

02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:21.080
No, it's your turn to be great.

02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:23.080
What if they scream when they see us?

02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:26.080
But the lady told us they were friendly thingin' me.

02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:28.080
Oh, sorry.

02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:40.080
Go on, do it.

02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:42.080
Excuse me.

02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:44.080
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:54.080
Now, what's the matter with you, too?

02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:57.080
Don't forget your suitcase, will you?

02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:03.080
It's alright, don't be frightened.

02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:05.080
I won't eat you.

02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:07.080
I'm the police inspector here.

02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:09.080
Been in the valley for years.

02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:10.080
Police?

02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:11.080
Oh, no.

02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:12.080
Oh, no.

02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:13.080
We're not thieves.

02:05:13.080 --> 02:05:15.080
Well, I'm all in the suitcase.

02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:16.080
Oh, no.

02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:18.080
We're under a bed.

02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:21.080
Well, nobody said that you did.

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:23.080
Then you haven't come to arrest us.

02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:25.080
Have you?

02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:26.080
Of course I haven't.

02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:28.080
I've come to see the movement family.

02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:34.080
It is our suitcase.

02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:36.080
It is.

02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:37.080
Of course it is.

02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:40.080
Now, have you come to see the movements, too?

02:05:41.080 --> 02:05:42.080
Hello?

02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:44.080
Oh, oh, oh.

02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:46.080
Oh, there you are.

02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:48.080
I thought it was you.

02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:53.080
Are you expecting these two guests, Mum and Mama?

02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:54.080
I think so.

02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:57.080
And they've got a suitcase, so they must be staying.

02:05:57.080 --> 02:05:58.080
That's nice.

02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:00.080
You will stay, won't you?

02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:02.080
Is it alright with you?

02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:04.080
Of course it is.

02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:06.080
I'm Mum and Mama.

02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:09.080
I'm Dany, and this is my friend Bob, Mum and Mama.

02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:11.080
You're welcome.

02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:14.080
Come in and make yourselves at home.

02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:17.080
I think it'll be okay, Dany.

02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:20.080
Careful!

02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:21.080
He must have dropped it!

02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:22.080
Hi!

02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:26.080
They are a bit strange, aren't they?

02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:28.080
Yes, definitely.

02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:30.080
So, what can I do for you today, Inspector?

02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:35.080
Oh, well, I heard that Mumble was back from holiday, so...

02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:37.080
Yes, that's right.

02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:39.080
Oh, do you want...

02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:41.080
Are you here now?

02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:42.080
No, Inspector.

02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:44.080
I'm afraid she's gone home with little Mai.

02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:46.080
Oh, right.

02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:48.080
I have to keep an eye on things, you know?

02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:50.080
Very important.

02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:51.080
Who goes away?

02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:53.080
Who comes back?

02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:59.080
Well, I'll say goodbye, Dan, Mum and Mama.

02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:03.080
I do believe he's fallen for Mumble.

02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:05.080
But has she fallen for him?

02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:06.080
I wonder.

02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:07.080
What are the new guests doing?

02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:09.080
Looking scared, mostly.

02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:11.080
Who one...

02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:12.080
Do one...

02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:14.080
Do one...

02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:19.080
Do one...

02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:32.080
Here you are.

02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:33.080
I've emptied these drawers for you.

02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:35.080
There should be enough room.

02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:37.080
Thank you, Norman.

02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:45.080
Where should we put this suitcase?

02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:48.080
Let's see.

02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:50.080
In this drawer?

02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:56.080
Look, there's a good place to hide, too.

02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:57.080
Oh, look at this.

02:07:57.080 --> 02:08:00.080
They made such a pretty bad for us.

02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:02.080
I like the movements.

02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:04.080
They didn't scream at all.

02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:10.080
You still gotta be careful, though.

02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:18.080
No.

02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:23.080
We've had some very strange people staying at our house,

02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:26.080
but I think these two are really weird.

02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:28.080
Well, they're Northerners.

02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:29.080
I guess so.

02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:31.080
With names like Thingamy and Bob.

02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:33.080
And that suitcase.

02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:37.080
They look a lot like fugitives to me, Snuffkin.

02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:40.080
And perhaps they're dangerous criminals on the run.

02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:42.080
Do you want to see them?

02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:45.080
Yeah, I wouldn't mind, Mum.

02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:46.080
Norman?

02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:14.080
Ah, there you are.

02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:15.080
Where are they doing now?

02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:16.080
No idea.

02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:20.080
I couldn't hear anything, so they must be asleep.

02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:23.080
We think they're fugitives, Mum and Papa.

02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:25.080
They're probably on the run from the law.

02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:29.080
Well, they are a bit funny, but they're suitcase.

02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:31.080
Gold coins.

02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:33.080
Stole and state secrets.

02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:36.080
We better hide all the matches, Papa.

02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:39.080
Public enemies, numbers, and two,

02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:41.080
but they don't look like it, though.

02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:44.080
How about some tea, Snuffkin?

02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:45.080
Sniff?

02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:46.080
Yes, please.

02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:48.080
Any cakes as well?

02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:50.080
Oh.

02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:11.080
Thingamy?

02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:21.080
Oh, no.

02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:23.080
This look is gone, too.

02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:24.080
What am I going to do?

02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:25.080
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:26.080
What am I going to do?

02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:28.080
What am I going to do?

02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:30.080
You wake up, ready?

02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:31.080
Oh.

02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:33.080
What a nerfie you're doing under the bed.

02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:36.080
It's the safest place.

02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:38.080
Something's about to happen, though.

02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:40.080
I can feel her coming.

02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:41.080
That's what woke me up.

02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:42.080
Don't be silly.

02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:44.080
She can't know we're here.

02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:45.080
She can.

02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:48.080
And I know she'll be here to hide.

02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:58.080
Well, it's very windy tonight, moment.

02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:02.080
You know, chilly, too, don't you think?

02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:05.080
Oh, hello.

02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:09.080
Did you sleep well?

02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:11.080
Would you like some tea?

02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:13.080
Hey, so that's them.

02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:15.080
Don't worry.

02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:16.080
These are good friends of mine.

02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:17.080
Let me introduce you.

02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:19.080
Sniff and snuff can.

02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:24.080
And what's the matter?

02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:28.080
She's coming.

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:30.080
Yes, she is.

02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:32.080
Well, who is my dear?

02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:33.080
The girl.

02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:34.080
The girl.

02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:36.080
Yes ... she's terrible.

02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:37.080
Who?

02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:40.080
You know who she is?

02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:41.080
Yes.

02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:42.080
I've never seen her.

02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:44.080
But I've heard she's a scary monster, all right.

02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:45.080
Scary monster?

02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:48.080
And this, uh, grope is after you.

02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:50.080
Yes, she is.

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:04.080
Now, don't you worry.

02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:06.080
She'll think twice before she tangles with me.

02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:07.080
Will she?

02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:10.080
If she's a scary monster?

02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:11.080
Monster or not.

02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:14.080
If you're a guest in Moomin House, nothing will harm you.

02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:15.080
Right, everyone.

02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:18.080
Lock all the doors and you two go to your room.

02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:20.080
Thank you, Moomin Papa.

02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:23.080
Nobody is going to get in here.

02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:24.080
Well said.

02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:28.080
To Am's family, to Am's.

02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:31.080
Ready for more tea, anyone?

02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:34.080
What's the matter?

02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:37.080
We're going to be attacked by a huge scary monster.

02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:38.080
Heavens.

02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:42.080
You'd better get the frying pan, Mama.

02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:43.080
Oh dear.

02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:49.080
All right.

02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:51.080
Has everyone got a weapon?

02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:10.080
Oh.

02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:35.080
Well, it's midnight.

02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:36.080
I don't know.

02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:37.080
It's midnight.

02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:40.080
I don't believe in that stupid grog.

02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:41.080
I hope you're right.

02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:51.080
She's coming.

02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:52.080
She's here.

02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:54.080
Yes, she's very close now.

02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:09.080
I'm going home.

02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:11.080
This is silly.

02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:12.080
We can't wait up all night.

02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:15.080
Besides, I'm getting very sleepy.

02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:17.080
It's up to you.

02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:18.080
Right.

02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:19.080
I'm going, man.

02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:20.080
Moomin Papa.

02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:21.080
Watch your back.

02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:24.080
Yes.

02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:25.080
Keep in the open.

02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:28.080
You guys are only trying to frighten me.

02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:31.080
Well, it won't work.

02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:37.080
She's here.

02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:39.080
No, she's not.

02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:41.080
There are no such things as monsters.

02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:44.080
Just a trap blowing the candles out.

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:54.080
Hmm.

02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:55.080
You see?

02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:57.080
There's nobody there.

02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:02.080
Well, in that case, there's nothing to stop you going home, Sniff.

02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:08.080
Do you think I'm scared?

02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:09.080
You're making it up.

02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:10.080
Come on, admit it.

02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:12.080
There aren't any grog.

02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:13.080
Not at all.

02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:30.080
You see?

02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:32.080
There's no one here at all.

02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:38.080
Uh-huh.

02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:52.080
Oh, be careful.

02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:53.080
Watch what you're doing.

02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:54.080
It's here.

02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:55.080
It's here.

02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:56.080
Where?

02:15:56.080 --> 02:15:58.080
Right outside that door.

02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:00.080
Big and black and horrible.

02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:01.080
Right.

02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:04.080
No, don't open it.

02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:05.080
She'll get in.

02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:09.080
Come on, everybody.

02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:17.080
Well, there's nobody here, Sniff.

02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:18.080
Are you sure?

02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:26.080
I can't see anything.

02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:29.080
Oh, I must have scared.

02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:32.080
That silly old grog away, moment.

02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:35.080
That will teach her to come sniffing around here, all right?

02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:37.080
No, that she is.

02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:51.080
Mm-hmm.

02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:53.080
Mrs. Groke, we'd like you to go home.

02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:55.080
Now you just go on.

02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:58.080
You're upsetting our guests.

02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:00.080
And you're freezing my roses.

02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:02.080
Yes, you've been bullied.

02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:07.080
I'm sorry, but you really must leave.

02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:09.080
Please go before I count to ten.

02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:22.080
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine and a half.

02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:28.080
All right.

02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:50.080
All right.

02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:52.080
All right.

02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:54.080
What?

02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:58.080
Hey, are you all right, moment?

02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:00.080
Look at the ground.

02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:04.080
It's all frozen.

02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:16.080
That's a Groke's voice.

02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:19.080
It's cold.

02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:20.080
Isn't it?

02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:22.080
I don't think she'll be back tonight.

02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:24.080
Let's all go in and have a hot drink.

02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:29.080
The Groke didn't come back that night.

02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:32.080
But what did she want in movement house?

02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:39.080
And will she return perhaps another night when they're all asleep?

02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:46.080
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:54.080
Believing is sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:58.080
They're always happy and always at play.

02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:01.080
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:05.080
The movements.

02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:09.080
The movements.

02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:16.080
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

02:19:16.080 --> 02:19:23.080
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:27.080
They're always happy and always at play.

02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:31.080
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:34.080
The movements.

02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:38.080
The movements.

02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:44.080
The movements.

02:19:53.080 --> 02:20:04.080
The movements.

02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:07.080
Here they are for one and all.

02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:10.080
The movements are about to come.

02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:13.080
Come on and sit down here with me.

02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:15.080
They're for you on your TV.

02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:18.080
They are the movements.

02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:21.080
They are the movements.

02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:24.080
So come with me, give me your hand.

02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:27.080
I'll take you up to a movement land.

02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:30.080
You can fly just like a bird.

02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:32.080
Sing that song ever.

02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:35.080
There were the movements.

02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:38.080
There were the movements.

02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:41.080
There were the movements.

02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:44.080
There were the movements.

02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:47.080
There were the movements.

02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:50.080
There were the movements.

02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:53.080
There were the movements.

02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:56.080
There were the movements.

02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:59.080
There were the movements.

02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:02.080
There were the movements.

02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:05.080
There were the movements.

02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:08.080
There were the movements.

02:21:08.080 --> 02:21:11.080
There were the movements.

02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:14.080
There were the movements.

02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:17.080
There were the movements.

02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:20.080
There were the movements.

02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:23.080
There were the movements.

02:21:43.080 --> 02:21:45.080
With all the excitement of that night,

02:21:45.080 --> 02:21:50.080
Sniff decided not to go home and was sharing movement's bed.

02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:54.080
Snuffkin, as always, preferred to sleep in his tent.

02:21:54.080 --> 02:21:56.080
You remember what happened?

02:21:56.080 --> 02:22:02.080
The horrible grok coming after thingamy and bob and everything freezing?

02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:07.080
For a moment, however, the night wasn't quite over yet.

02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:18.080
Mommy, papa! Help me!

02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:21.080
The grok is after me!

02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:31.080
I can't run anymore!

02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:51.080
Why am I on the floor?

02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:54.080
Sniff?

02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:05.080
Morning, mama.

02:23:05.080 --> 02:23:08.080
Good morning, moving. Is Sniff up yet?

02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:10.080
You're joking.

02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:12.080
Where is the thingamy and bob?

02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:14.080
It's not stirred yet.

02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:16.080
The poor things are tired out.

02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:18.080
Papa's not still asleep, is he?

02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:22.080
No, he's looking at my rose bushes.

02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:25.080
Are they okay, papa?

02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:27.080
No, frozen to death and look.

02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:29.080
What?

02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:33.080
That's where she was standing over there where the grass is dead.

02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:39.080
She must have been real cold to freeze the roses.

02:23:39.080 --> 02:23:41.080
What a shame! They were very pretty.

02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:46.080
There's not much left to them now. We'll have to grow some new ones.

02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:48.080
I dreamed that she was chasing me, papa.

02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:53.080
Oh, don't worry, moment. I think she's only after thingamy and bob.

02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:56.080
So there are not fugitives from justice, after all?

02:23:56.080 --> 02:24:01.080
I have a feeling that they would prefer that moment.

02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:04.080
Aren't thingamy and bob coming down?

02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:07.080
Yes, if they could have breakfast in their room, if you didn't mind.

02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:09.080
Well, what did they tell you?

02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:10.080
What?

02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:12.080
About why the groke is chasing them.

02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:17.080
Oh, they just looked terrified and wouldn't say anything about her at all.

02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:21.080
You know, we really ought to find out why.

02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:23.080
Yes, you're right.

02:24:23.080 --> 02:24:28.080
Moment, mama, why don't you take their breakfast up and see if they'll find out why?

02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:32.080
Moment, mama, why don't you take their breakfast up and see if they'll tell you anything?

02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:35.080
If any of us can get it out of the meal can.

02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:49.080
Who's that?

02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:53.080
It's only me. I've brought you both a nice breakfast.

02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:05.080
Well, what did they say?

02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:09.080
It seems that the groke is after the suitcase, not them.

02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:13.080
I wonder what's in it, perhaps they've stolen her mummy as well.

02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:17.080
And they also said that it did use to belong to her.

02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:21.080
Oh dear, if they've stolen it, they're not.

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:26.080
And they also said that it did use to belong to her.

02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:28.080
Oh dear, if they've stolen it.

02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:31.080
I don't know about that.

02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:35.080
I asked them how they got it, but they wouldn't say another word.

02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:36.080
Well, this is too much.

02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:38.080
We could be harboring criminals.

02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:42.080
I know they don't look like it, but you never know, do you?

02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:44.080
You can ask the groke.

02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:45.080
Don't shout.

02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:47.080
No, that's no good.

02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:50.080
We don't want to come back here most definitely.

02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:53.080
Let's ask the police inspector to question them.

02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:56.080
We don't want to get the police involved.

02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:58.080
Well, you'll suggest something, Anne.

02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:02.080
Quit shouting, sniff.

02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:07.080
Look, why don't you just wait for them to tell you a moment?

02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:11.080
I know it seems strange, but I've noticed that if you pretend not to be interested,

02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:14.080
people can't wait to tell you those secrets.

02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:18.080
They told Mama about the suitcase, but they wouldn't say anything to Papa.

02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:22.080
You know something, Moomin. They might open up to Snork Maiden.

02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:24.080
She's someone more their own age.

02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:27.080
You could be right.

02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:32.080
Hey, Snork Maiden.

02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:33.080
Where are you going?

02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:35.080
Moomin house.

02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:36.080
I'll come with you.

02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:39.080
But I thought you were living there.

02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:41.080
I was until mumble came back yesterday.

02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:43.080
How is she?

02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:46.080
Bossy, and she snores, too.

02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:47.080
Moomin.

02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:48.080
Snork Maiden.

02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:50.080
Where are you off to?

02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:53.080
Well, I was just on my way to see you.

02:26:53.080 --> 02:26:57.080
Oh, that's so nice, and I've come to see you, Moomin.

02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:00.080
I brought you a little present, Moomin.

02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:01.080
A present for me.

02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:03.080
Yes, and it's very beautiful.

02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:04.080
What is it?

02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:06.080
Something you must never break or lose.

02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:08.080
I promise I won't.

02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:10.080
There you are.

02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:11.080
Thank you.

02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:13.080
Go on, open it.

02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:19.080
Oh, what a beautiful shell.

02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:23.080
I spent all of yesterday on the beach searching for it just for you.

02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:26.080
Look, we can see ourselves in it.

02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:27.080
So we can.

02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:29.080
Thank you very much, Snork Maiden.

02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:32.080
It's my heart, and I want you to look after me.

02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:34.080
Oh, I will, Snork Maiden.

02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:35.080
I will.

02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:37.080
I'll think of you whenever I look at it.

02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:38.080
I'm Moomin.

02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:43.080
I promise you that I'll always kiss the shell before I go to sleep.

02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:46.080
It will be my most precious treasure.

02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:48.080
Apart from me.

02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:51.080
So what shall I do?

02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:53.080
Take them for a walk?

02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:56.080
Yes, but take your time and don't rush them.

02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:58.080
I'll let them cry on my shoulder.

02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:01.080
Yes, and try and talk to them as well, though.

02:28:01.080 --> 02:28:05.080
I feel very important and a little bit nervous, too.

02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:06.080
Have some tea first.

02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:08.080
Thank you, Moomin, Mama.

02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:11.080
Ah!

02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:21.080
We don't need your help, little Mai.

02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:22.080
Ha, that's what you think.

02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:24.080
I'd be able to weedle out their secrets.

02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:26.080
It's not an interrogation.

02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:28.080
We only want to talk to them, you know.

02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:30.080
So you can weedle out their secrets.

02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:31.080
I'll be very quiet.

02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:35.080
Little Mai, have you ever managed to be very quiet?

02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:39.080
Not really, but there's only one way to find out.

02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:41.080
You must let me go with Snork Maiden.

02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:45.080
No, this situation needs a tender understanding, Moomin.

02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:48.080
That's me, exactly!

02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:49.080
You ready?

02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:51.080
I suppose so.

02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:53.080
Hello, it's Moomin.

02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:55.080
Can I talk to you for a minute?

02:28:57.080 --> 02:28:58.080
Hello?

02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:01.080
This is Snork Maiden.

02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:03.080
She's a very good friend of mine.

02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:06.080
Hello, I'm very happy to meet you both.

02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:09.080
She's very tender and understanding,

02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:10.080
and she'd like to talk to you.

02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:11.080
Can she come in?

02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:16.080
Well, if she has to, Moomin.

02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:20.080
Come in, Mai.

02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:26.080
You pee, you pee, you pee.

02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:31.080
It's very beautiful, a perfect heart shape.

02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:34.080
I've never seen anything like it, Moomin.

02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:36.080
Would you like one, Mama?

02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:37.080
No, my dear.

02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:39.080
There should only be one shell like this.

02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:42.080
Then would you keep it somewhere safe for me?

02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:50.080
Well, Snork Maiden.

02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:54.080
I'm sure Snork Maiden will get it out of him.

02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:57.080
I do hope so. I think they like it anyway.

02:29:58.080 --> 02:30:02.080
I have a feeling in my bones that Groke will be back tonight.

02:30:02.080 --> 02:30:03.080
Oh.

02:30:03.080 --> 02:30:06.080
If we could find out why she's after them, we'd know what to do.

02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:11.080
Mama won't have any garden left if that monster comes back every night.

02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:12.080
Moomin.

02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:22.080
Well done, Snork Maiden.

02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:28.080
Little Mai.

02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:35.080
Oh no, she'll ruin everything if we don't stop her.

02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:43.080
If you interfere, little Mai, I'll never forgive you.

02:30:43.080 --> 02:30:45.080
What, interfere? Me? Never.

02:30:46.080 --> 02:30:49.080
Look, let's just leave it up to Snork Maiden now, little Mai.

02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:52.080
You'll need me if Snork Maiden's not tender and understanding enough.

02:30:53.080 --> 02:30:54.080
Hey, Moomin.

02:30:55.080 --> 02:30:58.080
So, how is Snork Maiden getting on?

02:30:58.080 --> 02:31:01.080
Taking them for a stroll? Where are they?

02:31:09.080 --> 02:31:11.080
If we were narrow.

02:31:11.080 --> 02:31:13.080
Papa, if we get much closer.

02:31:13.080 --> 02:31:16.080
And the last thing we want is for them to see us.

02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:20.080
Looks like I'll have to go and talk to them. You're all too big.

02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:22.080
I'll come back later and tell you what they said.

02:31:23.080 --> 02:31:25.080
No, don't. You'll upset Snork Maiden.

02:31:25.080 --> 02:31:27.080
You're the one who's upsetting her.

02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:33.080
All right. Can I ask you again about the suitcase?

02:31:33.080 --> 02:31:34.080
Yes.

02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:37.080
Does that suitcase belong to you or is it the groaks?

02:31:38.080 --> 02:31:39.080
No.

02:31:42.080 --> 02:31:45.080
Let's try it another way. Who's is that suitcase?

02:31:45.080 --> 02:31:47.080
It's yours, it's yours.

02:31:48.080 --> 02:31:53.080
But you told Moomin Mama that it wasn't yours. It was the groaks.

02:31:53.080 --> 02:31:55.080
Yes, we did.

02:31:57.080 --> 02:32:01.080
Do you mind if I ask you one more time?

02:32:01.080 --> 02:32:03.080
Please do.

02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:05.080
Right. Here we go.

02:32:05.080 --> 02:32:08.080
Now, all I want is a simple yes or no.

02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:10.080
Is that suitcase yours or not?

02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:12.080
No, yes.

02:32:13.080 --> 02:32:17.080
Oh, take your time, Snork Maiden.

02:32:17.080 --> 02:32:19.080
And don't rush them, he said.

02:32:19.080 --> 02:32:21.080
What was that, Snork Maiden?

02:32:21.080 --> 02:32:24.080
Look, I'm sorry, but can I ask you again?

02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:26.080
Yes, as many times as you want.

02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:29.080
Thank you. This is the very last time.

02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:31.080
So please tell me the truth.

02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:36.080
Now then, the suitcase.

02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:37.080
Yes.

02:32:37.080 --> 02:32:38.080
You know which one?

02:32:38.080 --> 02:32:39.080
Yes.

02:32:39.080 --> 02:32:41.080
Does it belong to you?

02:32:41.080 --> 02:32:43.080
Yes, it does.

02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:45.080
So it's not the groaks.

02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:47.080
Yes, it is not the groaks.

02:32:47.080 --> 02:32:50.080
At last, we're getting somewhere, praise the booble.

02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:53.080
We're very happy for you.

02:32:53.080 --> 02:32:55.080
Snork Maiden is really having to work hard.

02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:58.080
I wouldn't have, I'd scare them into talking.

02:32:58.080 --> 02:32:59.080
You should have let me go.

02:32:59.080 --> 02:33:01.080
Yeah, but we wanted someone gentle.

02:33:01.080 --> 02:33:04.080
Snork Maiden is nice.

02:33:04.080 --> 02:33:07.080
Everybody in this house is nice.

02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:10.080
Do you think they'd let us stay here forever?

02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:11.080
Of course.

02:33:11.080 --> 02:33:13.080
If we can keep away from the grog.

02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:18.080
It took a long time, but in the end they trusted me.

02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:20.080
And now we're good friends.

02:33:20.080 --> 02:33:23.080
Who wouldn't trust you and want to be good friends?

02:33:23.080 --> 02:33:24.080
Thank you.

02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:28.080
It wasn't easy, though. They kept speaking together and I got rather muddled.

02:33:28.080 --> 02:33:30.080
But they did tell me somehow.

02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:31.080
Rather muddled.

02:33:31.080 --> 02:33:34.080
I told you guys, you should have let me do it.

02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:37.080
Oh, I'm afraid I didn't get very much, though.

02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:39.080
I knew you wouldn't.

02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:42.080
So, what did you find out then, Snork Maiden?

02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:43.080
Tell us.

02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:47.080
Well, first of all, the suitcase does seem to be theirs.

02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:49.080
That was one thing they made very clear.

02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:50.080
Linhul can the grog.

02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:51.080
Just a minute, Moomin.

02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:55.080
What's in the suitcase on the other hand belongs to the grog.

02:33:55.080 --> 02:33:56.080
That's the problem.

02:33:56.080 --> 02:34:00.080
Oh, dear. So they do have something belonging to a...

02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:01.080
Oh.

02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:03.080
Well, Snork Maiden, what is it?

02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:05.080
They wouldn't tell me what it is, little Mai.

02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:08.080
Only that it is the most beautiful thing in the world.

02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:10.080
Oh, is it?

02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:12.080
I wonder.

02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:15.080
This is very difficult to understand.

02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:19.080
I mean, thing of me and Bob don't look like thieves at all, do they?

02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:22.080
So, the grog just wanted back what is hers.

02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:26.080
I don't see how that big ugly monster could own the most beautiful thing in the world.

02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:30.080
Well, what they said was that she just happened to have it.

02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:33.080
They didn't say whether it belonged to her or not.

02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:35.080
So she might have stolen it herself.

02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:37.080
They shouldn't have taken it, though.

02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:39.080
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:44.080
Bob and thing of me are very frightened of how she'll take her revenge if she catches them.

02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:48.080
But they're very determined to keep what's in the suitcase, Moomin, Papa.

02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:51.080
Oh, this is a fine mess indeed.

02:34:51.080 --> 02:34:53.080
The grog is sure to come back tonight.

02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:54.080
What can we do?

02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:56.080
What can we do?

02:34:56.080 --> 02:34:57.080
What can we do?

02:34:57.080 --> 02:34:59.080
We can do the same as before.

02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:01.080
Yeah, but it's not fair to drive her away.

02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:04.080
If what's in the suitcase really does belong to her?

02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:10.080
She means to get the suitcase and I don't think it will be so easy to get rid of her this time.

02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:13.080
And if she stays, we'll have a never-ending winter.

02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:17.080
Well, I'll cover up the petunias just in case.

02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:19.080
Are you all going to stay here?

02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:20.080
I'll look after Snork.

02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:22.080
I will, Moomin, Mama, I'll stay.

02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:24.080
You'll stay, won't you, Snuffkin?

02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:26.080
Don't look so clump, everyone.

02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:27.080
I've got an idea.

02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:30.080
But it would help if we knew what was in that suitcase.

02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:32.080
But even if we didn't, it could still work.

02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:34.080
And what is it, dear?

02:35:34.080 --> 02:35:37.080
Just wait, Papa. You'll see.

02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:34.080
Oh!

02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:49.080
She's coming!

02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:50.080
Are we?

02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:52.080
She's not far away!

02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:54.080
Oh, I hope Moomin Papa can do something.

02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:56.080
It's your girl, little mom.

02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:57.080
Yes, I know.

02:36:57.080 --> 02:36:59.080
There's the king and the queen.

02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:01.080
This one?

02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:04.080
Uh-oh, she's coming.

02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:06.080
Just when I was winning.

02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:09.080
You better hide under the table, little my.

02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:10.080
Don't be stupid!

02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:13.080
How can I hit her with my rolling pin from there?

02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:23.080
Where is she, Papa?

02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:25.080
Exactly where she was yesterday.

02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:27.080
I'll go for a toast, alright, Papa?

02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:32.080
Let me go first, and then the rest of you can fan out behind me.

02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:34.080
Moomin Mama.

02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:36.080
What is it, Papa?

02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:39.080
Perhaps now's the time to tell us your idea.

02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:41.080
We haven't long.

02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:44.080
Wait!

02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:57.080
Don't go away! We want to talk to you!

02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:03.080
We know that you've come back to get what thingamy and Bob took from you.

02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:07.080
That is right, isn't it, huh?

02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:14.080
Well, won't you let them keep it, uh, perhaps?

02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:19.080
Now, will you sell it to them?

02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:21.080
Oh, dear.

02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:25.080
I have some very beautiful things here in my bag.

02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:29.080
Maybe you'd like to trade, Groke?

02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:42.080
What about this pendant? Isn't it lovely?

02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:47.080
So, you don't like that?

02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:50.080
Uh, what about this then?

02:38:52.080 --> 02:38:55.080
Or this?

02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:01.080
Oh.

02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:04.080
All right. Why don't you choose?

02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:09.080
Take anything you want from my handbag, except the hair slide.

02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:20.080
Which one do you want, this one?

02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:24.080
Let me see, with this.

02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:28.080
Oh, this one?

02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:32.080
Oh, dear, that's not really mine to give to you.

02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:34.080
The snorkemaiden gave that to Mumen.

02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:38.080
Is it all right if I give the shell to her Mumen?

02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:40.080
Oh, Mum!

02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:41.080
You'll never allow.

02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:42.080
Are you all right?

02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:47.080
Yes, my hand was suddenly frozen.

02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:50.080
No, you've got the shell, Mrs. Groke.

02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:55.080
Do you promise not to come back anymore?

02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:59.080
Because I'll get you if you do.

02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:07.080
Oh, Mum!

02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:17.080
Well, that was a close thing. I'm glad that's over.

02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:20.080
Oh, you were marvelous, Mumen.

02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:24.080
I'm so sorry, Mumen.

02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:28.080
I forgot that I had put your precious shell in my handbag to keep it safe.

02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:31.080
It's all right, Mumen. You gave it in a good cause.

02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:36.080
What snorkemaiden going to say, Mumen?

02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:37.080
What?

02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:40.080
I heard you. You said you'd never go to sleep without kissing it,

02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:43.080
or something equally stupid.

02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:45.080
Well, I'm not going to tell snorkemaiden,

02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:49.080
but I think Mum, I did the right thing.

02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:52.080
She'll find out I'm fed up with secrets.

02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:57.080
I'm always going to tell the truth from now on, no matter what.

02:41:03.080 --> 02:41:07.080
Mumen, Mumen! Look! I found one!

02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:09.080
Really?

02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:14.080
Well, it's very similar, but the one snorkemaiden gave me was much bigger.

02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:17.080
Oh, a lot bigger, was it?

02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:20.080
Mumen had decided that he had to find a shell that was exactly the same

02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:22.080
as the one snorkemaiden had given him.

02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:27.080
Then with luck, she would never find out what he'd done with it.

02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:35.080
Oh!

02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:44.080
This is it! This is it! I killed it!

02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:50.080
It's exactly the same as the other one.

02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:53.080
Nothing short of a miracle, isn't it?

02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:56.080
But then in Mumen Valley, miracles do happen.

02:41:57.080 --> 02:42:05.080
They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.

02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:12.080
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:16.080
They're always happy and always at play.

02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:20.080
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:27.080
They love the laughter and they love to live in the movements.

02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:34.080
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:38.080
They're always happy and always at play.

02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:42.080
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:45.080
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:50.080
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:53.080
The movements.

02:42:53.080 --> 02:42:57.080
The movements.

02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:03.080
The movements.

02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:22.080
The movements.

02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:25.080
Here they are for one and all.

02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:28.080
The movements are about to come.

02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:31.080
Come on and sit down here with me.

02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:33.080
They're here for you on your TV.

02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:36.080
They are the movements.

02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:39.080
They are the movements.

02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:42.080
So come with me, give me your hand.

02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:45.080
I'll take you up to Mumen land.

02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:48.080
You can fly just like a bird.

02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:50.080
Sing that song ever.

02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:53.080
There were the movements.

02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:56.080
There were the movements.

02:43:56.080 --> 02:43:59.080
There were the movements.

02:43:59.080 --> 02:44:02.080
There were the movements.

02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:05.080
There were the movements.

02:44:05.080 --> 02:44:08.080
There were the movements.

02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:15.080
There were the movements.

02:44:15.080 --> 02:44:18.080
There were the movements.

02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:21.080
There were the movements.

02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:24.080
There were the movements.

02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:27.080
There were the movements.

02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:30.080
There were the movements.

02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:33.080
There were the movements.

02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:36.080
There were the movements.

02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:39.080
There were the movements.

02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:45.080
There were the movements.

02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:50.080
There were the movements.

02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:54.080
There were the movements.

02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:57.080
There were the movements.

02:44:57.080 --> 02:45:00.080
I can't.

02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:17.280
That's all right.

02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:21.520
Thank you, think of me.

02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:22.520
Are you going out?

02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:24.520
Yes, for a walk.

02:45:24.520 --> 02:45:27.520
We'll have fun.

02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:36.440
It seems that think of me and Bob are well and truly part of Moomin House now.

02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:40.920
Luckily, they don't eat a lot, and are small enough to find the pencils that fall between

02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:45.360
the floorboards in the porch.

02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:50.440
Hey, this looks like a great hiding place.

02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:52.440
Nobody would ever find it here.

02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:53.440
Come on, Bob.

02:45:53.440 --> 02:45:56.440
Let's go get the suitcase, man.

02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:01.240
Are you sure it's not safe for an alarm?

02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:04.320
What would you say if someone went in when we went there?

02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:07.880
You wouldn't like it, would you?

02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:11.880
I think the Moomin's are much too nice to do anything like that.

02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:12.880
It's not there.

02:46:12.880 --> 02:46:15.320
It's the guests I'm thinking about.

02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:20.280
You know the Moomin's let anybody stay.

02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:23.160
Snork maiden.

02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:25.160
You lied to me, little Mai.

02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:26.680
Who me?

02:46:26.680 --> 02:46:31.120
Moomin still has the shell that I gave him, but you said that he didn't.

02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:32.120
Impossible.

02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:34.240
Moomin mama gave it to the croak.

02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:36.080
I was there when she did it.

02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:37.400
Look, I saw it.

02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:38.760
He showed it to me.

02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:40.120
Are you really sure?

02:46:40.120 --> 02:46:41.440
Was it the same one?

02:46:41.440 --> 02:46:42.440
Of course it was.

02:46:42.440 --> 02:46:44.640
I'm not stupid, you know.

02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:45.800
That's very odd.

02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:48.360
I saw her do it with my own eyes.

02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:51.840
Well, I'll go and ask Moomin right now, little Mai.

02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:56.080
It's a bit awkward, but if I'm going to be honest, Snork maiden.

02:46:56.080 --> 02:46:57.080
What?

02:46:57.080 --> 02:47:00.920
Well, I've decided that from now on, I'm only going to tell the truth.

02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:01.920
Oh, yes.

02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:04.520
And I found something you might be interested in.

02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:06.080
Well, what is it?

02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:09.720
Mungle and I were down on the beach yesterday, and you remember all those things we found

02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:11.040
washed up by the storm?

02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:15.120
Do you mean on the haddy fatter's island that we sailed to?

02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:16.120
Yes.

02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:19.360
And do you remember the figurehead that Moomin liked best of all?

02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:22.400
You know, the lady made of wood and painted.

02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:24.560
She was really lovely, wasn't she?

02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:25.560
Yes.

02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:26.560
I remember.

02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:27.760
Moomin wanted to keep it.

02:47:27.760 --> 02:47:28.760
So what about it?

02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:30.520
Well, it's here on the beach.

02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:34.200
It was still the same asigi as ever.

02:47:34.200 --> 02:47:36.000
Was it the same one?

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:37.000
Yes.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:38.000
I remember her pretty face.

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:39.480
No legs, though.

02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:41.240
She's just a silly wooden doll.

02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:45.680
Oh, I know that, but she's got those gorgeous eyes in lovely long hair.

02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:49.840
Little Mai, why all this fuss about this silly figurehead?

02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:50.840
Trust him.

02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:54.160
Only someone as stupid as Moomin could fall in love with a figurehead.

02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:56.760
It's probably still dreaming about her every night.

02:47:56.760 --> 02:47:57.760
Ah!

02:47:57.760 --> 02:47:58.760
Do you think it's still there?

02:47:58.760 --> 02:47:59.760
Charles Nork Maiden.

02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:04.680
If no one else has found her already, do you think the ocean might come and wash her

02:48:04.680 --> 02:48:05.680
away again?

02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:08.760
Why all these silly questions, Nork Maiden?

02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:11.840
Moomin would go and rescue her if he knew.

02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:12.840
So?

02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:14.040
That would be terrible.

02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:15.600
I couldn't bear it at all.

02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:17.600
I really couldn't.

02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:19.120
How pathetic.

02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:24.200
He'll probably take her home and keep her in his room forever.

02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:27.240
My expect she's too big to go through the door.

02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:30.440
He'll just sit and stare at her with that lovesick look on his face.

02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:31.440
I know he will.

02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:32.440
Oh!

02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:33.440
Where are you going now?

02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:35.680
I thought you were going to Moomin house.

02:48:35.680 --> 02:48:38.880
I was, but there's something more important I have to do.

02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:45.360
OK, it's clear.

02:48:54.880 --> 02:48:57.880
Hey, you two, you're not leaving, are you?

02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:00.160
No, we're just, uh, we're going.

02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:03.960
Why have you got the suitcase, then?

02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:06.360
Moomin, would you help us with something?

02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:07.360
Of course.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:12.880
Thank you very much, Moomin.

02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:14.040
Oh, that's OK.

02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:16.240
It's a bit too big for you to carry.

02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:18.440
We can take it from here.

02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:19.240
It's all right.

02:49:19.240 --> 02:49:20.440
It's not very heavy.

02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:24.320
Oh, silly me.

02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:27.720
It wouldn't be a very secret place if I'd seen it, would it?

02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:29.160
I'll see you later.

02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:30.360
Don't be too long now.

02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:32.320
How much you won't tell anyone, will you?

02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:33.520
Of course, I won't.

02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:46.120
Oh.

02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:48.840
Hey, what are you doing up there, little lie?

02:49:48.840 --> 02:49:49.960
I'm coming down.

02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:51.880
What does it look like?

02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:54.320
You're much too small to do that.

02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:56.760
The rungs are too far apart for you to reach.

02:49:56.760 --> 02:49:58.000
Just you watch me.

02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:11.720
Moomin, I have a problem.

02:50:11.720 --> 02:50:13.960
Do you mind if I ask you something?

02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:14.800
Go ahead.

02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:17.880
Did Moomin, Mama, give Snorkman's hard-shaped shell

02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:19.040
to the grove?

02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:21.480
Yes, she did.

02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:24.640
So you and the grove can't both have it, can you?

02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:27.400
That's just where you're wrong.

02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:29.120
But that's simply impossible.

02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:30.840
You can't have.

02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:33.200
The grove simply got another one.

02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:35.200
That's not true.

02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:35.880
All right.

02:50:35.880 --> 02:50:38.560
But it would only upset Snorkman if she knew.

02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:40.480
So I'm not going to tell her.

02:50:40.480 --> 02:50:41.760
You rotten thing.

02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:43.640
Why don't you just tell me the truth?

02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:45.160
Because it's a secret.

02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:47.720
But I want to know, Moomin.

02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:51.040
Look, Moomin, now why don't you tell me your secret?

02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:52.760
And then I'll tell you mine.

02:50:52.760 --> 02:50:53.560
What is it?

02:50:53.560 --> 02:50:55.680
Really very top secret.

02:50:55.680 --> 02:50:58.080
Go on, then, tell me.

02:50:58.080 --> 02:50:59.480
Tell me yours first.

02:50:59.480 --> 02:51:01.880
No, you tell me first.

02:51:01.880 --> 02:51:02.360
I know.

02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:04.000
Let's say them together.

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:05.160
All right.

02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:06.640
Ready?

02:51:06.640 --> 02:51:07.800
One, two, three.

02:51:07.800 --> 02:51:08.320
One, two, three.

02:51:08.320 --> 02:51:10.320
After we get the shell to the beach today,

02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:12.480
we'll find something that you like.

02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:14.440
Please, so I'll have the bigger head later.

02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:16.480
We'll just like it.

02:51:16.480 --> 02:51:17.400
What did you say?

02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:18.120
The figure head?

02:51:18.120 --> 02:51:20.880
Yes, by the K.

02:51:20.880 --> 02:51:21.760
Wait a minute.

02:51:21.760 --> 02:51:24.000
You didn't finish telling me your secret.

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:25.360
I'll tell you later.

02:51:25.360 --> 02:51:26.400
That's not there.

02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:28.160
You've got to tell me now.

02:51:40.320 --> 02:51:53.040
What do you think, Moomin, Starlight?

02:51:53.040 --> 02:51:54.880
I don't know.

02:51:54.880 --> 02:51:57.160
Maybe he's looking for shells again.

02:51:57.160 --> 02:51:58.760
I don't think so.

02:51:58.760 --> 02:52:01.440
He looks a bit worried to me.

02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:10.240
Maybe he's lost something important.

02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:12.040
We have to go.

02:52:12.040 --> 02:52:13.800
As far as you can road.

02:52:13.800 --> 02:52:16.120
We're a long way out already, you know.

02:52:16.120 --> 02:52:19.040
I want to make sure that the lady will never turn up again.

02:52:19.040 --> 02:52:21.040
We must go further out.

02:52:21.040 --> 02:52:22.880
We must be far enough by now.

02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:24.200
I'm tired.

02:52:24.200 --> 02:52:27.640
No, the Kurds could still drag her in from here.

02:52:27.640 --> 02:52:29.280
Keep going.

02:52:29.280 --> 02:52:40.160
He looks very unhappy.

02:52:40.160 --> 02:52:41.160
You've got to cheer him up.

02:52:41.160 --> 02:52:42.160
But how?

02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:44.160
There's only one way, Bob.

02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:47.160
Yes, you're right, thing of me.

02:52:47.160 --> 02:52:48.160
Hello.

02:52:48.160 --> 02:53:04.400
You look so sad, Moomin, that we thought we'd try and make you happy again.

02:53:04.400 --> 02:53:06.600
You don't mind, do you?

02:53:06.600 --> 02:53:08.600
No, but you don't have to.

02:53:08.600 --> 02:53:09.600
I'm all right, really.

02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:10.600
How about this, Dan Moomin?

02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:11.600
We're going to show you what's in our suitcase.

02:53:11.600 --> 02:53:12.600
Go.

02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:13.600
Would you like that, Moomin?

02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:14.600
It's very interesting.

02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:15.600
Oh my gosh.

02:53:15.600 --> 02:53:16.600
Will you?

02:53:16.600 --> 02:53:17.600
Do you need some help in there?

02:53:17.600 --> 02:53:18.600
No, I think we can manage.

02:53:18.600 --> 02:53:25.600
I can't believe it.

02:53:25.600 --> 02:53:33.600
I can't believe it.

02:53:33.600 --> 02:53:35.600
Oh my gosh.

02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:36.600
Will you?

02:53:36.600 --> 02:53:37.600
Mmm.

02:53:37.600 --> 02:53:38.600
I can't believe it.

02:53:38.600 --> 02:53:39.600
I can't believe it.

02:53:39.600 --> 02:53:40.600
I can't believe it.

02:53:40.600 --> 02:53:41.600
I can't believe it.

02:53:41.600 --> 02:53:42.600
I can't believe it.

02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:43.600
I can't believe it.

02:53:43.600 --> 02:53:44.600
I can't believe it.

02:53:44.600 --> 02:53:45.600
I can't believe it.

02:53:45.600 --> 02:53:46.600
I can't believe it.

02:53:46.600 --> 02:53:47.600
I can't believe it.

02:53:47.600 --> 02:53:48.600
Hey!

02:53:48.600 --> 02:53:49.600
Oh gosh.

02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:50.600
By my tail.

02:53:50.600 --> 02:53:53.600
Do you like it?

02:53:53.600 --> 02:53:54.600
Oh boy.

02:53:54.600 --> 02:53:55.600
Do I like it?

02:53:55.600 --> 02:53:57.600
Then you're not sad anymore, Moomin?

02:53:57.600 --> 02:53:58.600
Oh no.

02:53:58.600 --> 02:53:59.600
That's good, isn't it?

02:53:59.600 --> 02:54:00.600
Yes, very good.

02:54:00.600 --> 02:54:01.600
It was such a beautiful ruby.

02:54:01.600 --> 02:54:07.600
How it changed color from soft red to soft blue and then to pink?

02:54:07.600 --> 02:54:09.600
What minute it was like a fluke?

02:54:09.600 --> 02:54:10.600
Oh no.

02:54:10.600 --> 02:54:11.600
That's good, isn't it?

02:54:11.600 --> 02:54:12.600
Yes, very good.

02:54:12.600 --> 02:54:13.600
It was such a beautiful ruby.

02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:16.600
How it changed color from soft red to soft blue and then to pink?

02:54:16.660 --> 02:54:19.000
How minute it was like a flag leaping out of the center.

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.600
Then suddenly it was like a black tulip.

02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:22.600
It was...

02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:23.600
Hmm...

02:54:23.600 --> 02:54:25.600
Perhaps that's the king's ruby.

02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:27.600
It was just beautiful.

02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:30.600
That's the one the Hobgoblin is searching for.

02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:31.600
Oh no.

02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:33.600
However far away he is.

02:54:33.600 --> 02:54:35.680
He'll come back on his black panther.

02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:36.680
Looking for it.

02:54:36.680 --> 02:54:38.680
And he's sure to find it.

02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:41.600
Because he'll know that Thbingamion Bob have it.

02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:42.600
First the G Rover.

02:54:42.600 --> 02:54:43.600
Now the Hobgoblin.

02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:45.600
What are we going to do?

02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:55.600
No more than a week later, and like a bolt from the blue, a real catastrophe hit Moomin Valley.

02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:04.600
No, it's not in the bedroom either.

02:55:04.600 --> 02:55:07.600
That's very odd. Where did you see it last?

02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:10.600
I'm sure it was here somewhere, Papa.

02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:12.600
Well, perhaps it's in the garden.

02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:16.600
No, I haven't been out here all day.

02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:20.600
Moomin Mama's handbag is missing.

02:55:20.600 --> 02:55:24.600
Full of useful things like socks and sweets and string.

02:55:28.600 --> 02:55:29.600
What's the matter, Mama?

02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:32.600
I can't find my handbag and I'm lost without it.

02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:33.600
We've looked everywhere.

02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:36.600
Will I get a reward if I find it, Moomin Mama?

02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:41.600
Yes, we'll have a big party for everyone with cakes, jelly, and everything.

02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:46.600
And as a special treat, no one has to wash or go to bed early.

02:55:46.600 --> 02:55:49.600
I'll find it, Mama. No, I will.

02:55:55.600 --> 02:55:58.600
Moomin Mama, I've checked the cellar. It's not there.

02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:00.600
Oh, dear. Where could it be?

02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:04.600
I haven't been in the cellar for days, so I didn't think it would be there.

02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:06.600
But thank you, dear snork.

02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:18.600
Word got round Moomin Valley of the missing handbag.

02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:21.600
And soon everyone was helping to look for it.

02:56:24.600 --> 02:56:26.600
What a lot of people!

02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:28.600
I wonder what they're looking for.

02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:39.600
What's everybody looking for?

02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:42.600
My handbag, thingamy.

02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:44.600
The one with the two nice little pockets?

02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:47.600
Yes, that's the one. It's been missing for days.

02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:49.600
Will you two help us look?

02:56:52.600 --> 02:56:56.600
It makes such a lovely place to sleep and don't you think?

02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:01.600
Moomin Mama looks very sad.

02:57:01.600 --> 02:57:03.600
Perhaps we better give it back.

02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:11.600
Oh.

02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:24.600
Oh, you found it.

02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:28.600
Look, everybody, thingamy and Bob have found it.

02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:37.600
Oh, thank you. Where on earth did you find it?

02:57:38.600 --> 02:57:40.600
In the bush under the white birch tree.

02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:43.600
It's a very, very nice handbag.

02:57:43.600 --> 02:57:48.600
Let's have a party tonight to celebrate the return of Mama's handbag.

02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:56.600
As you all know, this party is in honor of thingamy and Bob finding Moomin Mama's handbag.

02:57:56.600 --> 02:58:00.600
And to thank everyone who took part in the big search.

02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:02.600
Let's raise our glasses to our heroes.

02:58:02.600 --> 02:58:09.600
Here's the thingamy and Bob who found Moomin Mama's handbag without which Moomin Valley would never be the same again.

02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:11.600
Cheers!

02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:22.600
Now, I think Moomin would like to say a few words.

02:58:22.600 --> 02:58:23.600
A moment.

02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:27.600
We're very pleased that Mama's handbag is back again.

02:58:27.600 --> 02:58:30.600
And thank you to our northern friends, thingamy and Bob.

02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:33.600
You're seeing as how this is a very special occasion.

02:58:33.600 --> 02:58:37.600
And also, as a thank you for the party, they have decided to show us what is in their suitcase.

02:58:37.600 --> 02:58:40.600
And I'm sure you'll all be astounded by what you see.

02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:45.600
Ha! Come closer, everyone. Now, thingamy and Bob, are you ready?

02:58:50.600 --> 02:58:52.600
Ready, everyone?

02:58:52.600 --> 02:58:53.600
Ready, everyone?

02:58:53.600 --> 02:58:54.600
One, two, three.

02:58:57.600 --> 02:58:59.600
How wonderful.

02:58:59.600 --> 02:59:04.600
I don't know how the growth could swap that for an old seashell.

02:59:06.600 --> 02:59:10.600
By my, that must be the King's Ruby.

02:59:25.600 --> 02:59:27.600
The King's Ruby, I found it.

02:59:29.600 --> 02:59:31.600
It's the Hub Goblin!

02:59:35.600 --> 02:59:38.600
Yes, this is it. The Ruby I've sworn to find.

02:59:38.600 --> 02:59:39.600
Huh?

02:59:39.600 --> 02:59:41.600
Don't touch it! It's ours!

02:59:41.600 --> 02:59:44.600
Go away, you nasty Hub Goblin.

02:59:44.600 --> 02:59:47.600
But that King's Ruby belongs only to me.

02:59:47.600 --> 02:59:54.600
No, it doesn't. The growth gave it to singamy and Bob in fair exchange for a heart-shaped shell, Mr. Hub Goblin.

02:59:54.600 --> 02:59:56.600
Did he say a heart-shaped shell?

02:59:56.600 --> 02:59:58.600
I think so.

02:59:58.600 --> 03:00:01.600
Anyway, I saw her give it to them with my own eyes.

03:00:01.600 --> 03:00:04.600
Show it belongs to them, not you.

03:00:04.600 --> 03:00:10.600
I've spent 300 years day and night searching everywhere for this Ruby.

03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:13.600
Well, that's very sad, but it still is.

03:00:13.600 --> 03:00:18.600
Now then, let's see. Would you exchange the Ruby for, say, two diamond mines?

03:00:18.600 --> 03:00:21.600
No! We don't mind anything else!

03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:32.600
No, I can't do it. I can't take it by force.

03:00:33.600 --> 03:00:37.600
It's been so long. What can I do?

03:00:47.600 --> 03:00:51.600
Would you like some punch? It's very nice.

03:00:52.600 --> 03:00:57.600
That's very kind of you, woman mama. I haven't had any for 85 years.

03:01:04.600 --> 03:01:06.600
Ah, quince.

03:01:06.600 --> 03:01:10.600
That's part of it, Mr. Hub Goblin. Have some more, please.

03:01:10.600 --> 03:01:14.600
No, thank you. Hub Goblins don't really drink very much.

03:01:14.600 --> 03:01:20.600
Well, this is a splendid punch and a splendid party. In return, I shall show you a little magic.

03:01:21.600 --> 03:01:26.600
I will give out three presents. Now what I can do is grant three wishes,

03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:30.600
so I want three of you to come forward and make a wish.

03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:33.600
You're not afraid, are you?

03:01:34.600 --> 03:01:38.600
How you look old enough not to be frightened, Mr. Emulan?

03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:46.600
Just let me think. Oh, yes, Mr. Hub Goblin. I broke the spade I borrowed from woman papa.

03:01:46.600 --> 03:01:49.600
No, Mr. Himmelan, have you ever make a proper wish?

03:01:50.600 --> 03:01:52.600
I would like a new spade, if you please.

03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:55.600
Very well, here you are.

03:01:55.600 --> 03:02:00.600
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Hub Goblin.

03:02:00.600 --> 03:02:02.600
Here you are, woman papa.

03:02:02.600 --> 03:02:04.600
Right, who's next?

03:02:04.600 --> 03:02:06.600
Excuse me?

03:02:08.600 --> 03:02:11.600
Yes, and what can I do for you, young lady?

03:02:11.600 --> 03:02:14.600
Well, I'm afraid it might be a little difficult.

03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:16.600
For me?

03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:19.600
Is that really what you want?

03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:20.600
Please.

03:02:20.600 --> 03:02:22.600
All right, then close your eyes.

03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:26.600
Your wish has now come true, young lady.

03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:29.600
Oh!

03:02:29.600 --> 03:02:31.600
Oh, snorke-may.

03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:33.600
Oh, snorke-may done.

03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:37.600
I've wanted eyes like that, wouldn't lady you think is so beautiful?

03:02:37.600 --> 03:02:39.600
Do you think I'm beautiful now, woman?

03:02:39.600 --> 03:02:43.600
Well, I, well, give me a mirror, someone.

03:02:43.600 --> 03:02:45.600
They're quite nice, really.

03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:49.600
What?

03:02:49.600 --> 03:02:51.600
Huh?

03:02:51.600 --> 03:02:53.600
Huh?

03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:56.600
This is horrible, horrible.

03:02:56.600 --> 03:03:00.600
Please, Mr. Hub Goblin, please give me my eyes back.

03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:04.600
I'm sorry, but I can only grant one wish per person.

03:03:04.600 --> 03:03:08.600
Oh, that's really me, no, please.

03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:12.600
Mr. Hub Goblin, can I make a wish now?

03:03:12.600 --> 03:03:15.600
Certainly, a golden chariot, a rock crystal goblin.

03:03:16.600 --> 03:03:18.600
Anything at all.

03:03:18.600 --> 03:03:21.600
A sack full of gold coins, you can be rich, woman.

03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:22.600
Really rich.

03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:25.600
I'm sorry, but movements is the last wish.

03:03:25.600 --> 03:03:28.600
I know, why don't you ask for two sackfuls of gold, woman?

03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:30.600
Then we can have one each, what do you think?

03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:33.600
No, sniff, I know what I'm going to wish.

03:03:33.600 --> 03:03:34.600
Oh, man.

03:03:34.600 --> 03:03:39.600
Mr. Hub Goblin, please change snorke-mayden's eyes back to her own.

03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:43.600
Never mind her, she can see all right, get the gold coins.

03:03:43.600 --> 03:03:46.600
The wish is made and fulfilled.

03:03:49.600 --> 03:03:51.600
There you are, have a look.

03:03:51.600 --> 03:03:55.600
Oh, now next time, think before you make a wish.

03:03:55.600 --> 03:03:57.600
Moment.

03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:02.600
Mr. Hub Goblin?

03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:03.600
Yes, think of me.

03:04:03.600 --> 03:04:08.600
If you can grant wishes like that, why don't you make a wish for yourself?

03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:12.600
I'm afraid my magic only works for other people.

03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:15.600
Mr. Hub Goblin, can we make a wish for you then?

03:04:15.600 --> 03:04:17.600
Please say we can't, please.

03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:18.600
I suppose so.

03:04:18.600 --> 03:04:20.600
Oh, please, it's important.

03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:23.600
Very well, as it is not for you.

03:04:23.600 --> 03:04:26.600
We wish for a movie just like yours.

03:04:26.600 --> 03:04:28.600
You shall have it.

03:04:34.600 --> 03:04:37.600
This is for you, Hub Goblin.

03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:41.600
Oh, thank you, thank you.

03:04:43.600 --> 03:04:48.600
And so that was how, after 300 years, the Hub Goblin search came to an end,

03:04:48.600 --> 03:04:52.600
and Moomin Valley had never had such a celebration.

03:04:52.600 --> 03:04:59.600
Everyone was happy, except possibly Sniff, who would have quite liked a sack full of gold coins.

03:05:12.600 --> 03:05:23.600
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.

03:05:23.600 --> 03:05:31.600
Believing in sharing, and caring, and giving the movements.

03:05:31.600 --> 03:05:35.600
They're always happy, and always at play.

03:05:35.600 --> 03:05:42.600
Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

03:05:42.600 --> 03:05:46.600
The Moomin's.

03:05:46.600 --> 03:05:53.600
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.

03:05:53.600 --> 03:06:00.600
Believing in sharing, and caring, and giving the movements.

03:06:00.600 --> 03:06:04.600
They're always happy, and always at play.

03:06:04.600 --> 03:06:11.600
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

03:06:11.600 --> 03:06:15.600
The Moomin's.

03:06:15.600 --> 03:06:21.600
The Moomin's.

03:06:30.600 --> 03:06:42.600
Here they are for one and all.

03:06:42.600 --> 03:06:45.600
The Moomin's are about to call.

03:06:45.600 --> 03:06:48.600
Come on and sit down here with me.

03:06:48.600 --> 03:06:51.600
They're for you on your TV.

03:06:51.600 --> 03:06:53.600
They are the movements.

03:06:53.600 --> 03:06:56.600
They are the movements.

03:06:57.600 --> 03:07:00.600
So come with me, give me your hand.

03:07:00.600 --> 03:07:03.600
I'll take you up to Moomin land.

03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:06.600
You can fly just like a bird.

03:07:06.600 --> 03:07:08.600
Sing that song ever.

03:07:08.600 --> 03:07:11.600
There were the movements.

03:07:11.600 --> 03:07:14.600
There were the movements.

03:07:14.600 --> 03:07:17.600
There were the movements.

03:07:17.600 --> 03:07:20.600
There were the movements.

03:07:20.600 --> 03:07:23.600
There were the movements.

03:07:23.600 --> 03:07:26.600
There were the movements.

03:07:53.600 --> 03:07:56.600
There were the movements.

03:07:56.600 --> 03:07:59.600
There were the movements.

03:08:24.600 --> 03:08:26.600
Come on man, you were here already.

03:08:26.600 --> 03:08:30.600
This is Moomin house.

03:08:30.600 --> 03:08:41.600
It has been raining since lunchtime, and Moomin and his friends had spent all afternoon in Moomin house, waiting for the sun to come out.

03:08:41.600 --> 03:08:46.600
So, Tiki's arrival was very welcome.

03:08:46.600 --> 03:08:48.600
Good evening, Moomin.

03:08:48.600 --> 03:08:52.600
Tiki, come here.

03:08:52.600 --> 03:08:55.600
Mama, don't take his hair.

03:08:55.600 --> 03:08:57.600
Come on in, Mani.

03:08:57.600 --> 03:09:00.600
I need Moomin.

03:09:00.600 --> 03:09:03.600
Is there someone with you?

03:09:03.600 --> 03:09:05.600
Yes, I brought my friend, Mani.

03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:09.600
Mani, don't be shy.

03:09:09.600 --> 03:09:11.600
Well, there's no one there.

03:09:11.600 --> 03:09:12.600
Yes, there is.

03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:14.600
You just can't see her.

03:09:14.600 --> 03:09:15.600
Really?

03:09:15.600 --> 03:09:19.600
Yes, I'm afraid she's very, very shy.

03:09:19.600 --> 03:09:22.600
I'll leave the door open for you, Mani.

03:09:22.600 --> 03:09:24.600
Come in when you're ready.

03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:26.600
She'll get soaked if she stays out there.

03:09:26.600 --> 03:09:30.600
Maybe that doesn't matter very much if you're invisible.

03:09:30.600 --> 03:09:33.600
Oh.

03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:38.600
Too Tiki, how nice.

03:09:38.600 --> 03:09:45.600
What is everyone looking at?

03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:49.600
About Mani, you know sometimes when people are very frightened,

03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:53.600
they can become invisible to the people around them.

03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:57.600
Poor Mani, she's looked after by an aunt who doesn't like her,

03:09:57.600 --> 03:10:02.600
and is really horrible to her and who only does it because she thinks it's her duty.

03:10:02.600 --> 03:10:06.600
It wouldn't be so bad if she just got mad and yelled at her,

03:10:06.600 --> 03:10:09.600
but she's cold and sarcastic, which is much worse.

03:10:09.600 --> 03:10:14.600
She doesn't care if Mani is unhappy and gives her horrible jobs.

03:10:14.600 --> 03:10:17.600
What's sarcastic?

03:10:17.600 --> 03:10:19.600
Uh, let's see.

03:10:19.600 --> 03:10:21.600
Suppose you tripped and fell over.

03:10:21.600 --> 03:10:23.600
What would Mum and Mama say?

03:10:23.600 --> 03:10:26.600
Well, she does me a fight hurt myself.

03:10:26.600 --> 03:10:29.600
Yes, well, you're lucky that Mum and Mama is so nice,

03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:31.600
but a lot of people would be mad at you.

03:10:31.600 --> 03:10:35.600
Now, this nasty old lady would say that maybe you're right, dear of dancing,

03:10:35.600 --> 03:10:39.600
but try not to do it when people are eaten, please.

03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:41.600
Gosh, that's horrible.

03:10:41.600 --> 03:10:45.600
Anyway, she just went on being more and more horrible to her,

03:10:45.600 --> 03:10:50.600
so that in the end, Nini was so upset she became invisible.

03:10:50.600 --> 03:10:54.600
And our aunt said she couldn't be bothered to look after little girl she couldn't see.

03:10:54.600 --> 03:10:57.600
Poor Nini.

03:10:57.600 --> 03:10:59.600
So she asked me to do it.

03:10:59.600 --> 03:11:01.600
Nini's still outside.

03:11:01.600 --> 03:11:05.600
Too nervous to come in.

03:11:05.600 --> 03:11:07.600
But what did you do to this old aunt?

03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:10.600
I hope you told her she heard Nini's feelings.

03:11:10.600 --> 03:11:14.600
He wouldn't have done any good, not with someone like her.

03:11:14.600 --> 03:11:18.600
So I took Nini home, and then as you're the nicest family I know,

03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:21.600
I brought her here so you could make her visible again.

03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:24.600
You were very flattered, of course, too, Tiki, but...

03:11:24.600 --> 03:11:27.600
If anyone can do it, you and Mum and Mama can.

03:11:27.600 --> 03:11:29.600
And Mum can play with her.

03:11:29.600 --> 03:11:31.600
Does she talk at all to Tiki?

03:11:31.600 --> 03:11:34.600
I'm afraid not. Not since she became invisible.

03:11:34.600 --> 03:11:35.600
Oh, dear.

03:11:35.600 --> 03:11:39.600
I'm sure I can think of lots of games, but it'll be hard to play

03:11:39.600 --> 03:11:43.600
if I can't see her. She'll be really good at hide and seek, though.

03:11:43.600 --> 03:11:50.600
Oh, it's okay. You'll know where she is because her aunt hung a little bell around her neck.

03:11:53.600 --> 03:11:56.600
Oh, look, the door's opened.

03:11:56.600 --> 03:11:59.600
That'll be Nini.

03:12:01.600 --> 03:12:06.600
Come in, Nini. It's all right. Don't be frightened.

03:12:06.600 --> 03:12:13.600
Come and meet everyone. This is your new home, and this is Mum and Mama and Mum and Papa.

03:12:13.600 --> 03:12:15.600
They're both very nice.

03:12:15.600 --> 03:12:18.600
Hello, I'm Mum and these are my friends.

03:12:21.600 --> 03:12:24.600
We were just having some tea. Would you like some?

03:12:24.600 --> 03:12:27.600
Oh, that is, if you can drink.

03:12:27.600 --> 03:12:31.600
Oh, perhaps I should make some lemonade.

03:12:32.600 --> 03:12:37.600
Well, now, perhaps you'd all like to go back to the table.

03:12:37.600 --> 03:12:40.600
If you'd care to sit down, Nini.

03:12:43.600 --> 03:12:50.600
I'm sorry I don't know any more about her, but I'm sure that everything will be okay now she's here.

03:12:50.600 --> 03:12:52.600
I'm certain it will.

03:12:52.600 --> 03:12:55.600
We'll do our best, Tiki.

03:12:57.600 --> 03:12:59.600
Here you are, Nini.

03:13:02.600 --> 03:13:08.600
Well, she seems to be okay now, so I'd better be getting along.

03:13:08.600 --> 03:13:14.600
I've got a lot of things to do. I'll try and come over to see how you're all going.

03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:17.600
That would really be nice.

03:13:20.600 --> 03:13:22.600
Oh, it's better.

03:13:22.600 --> 03:13:26.600
You have got room, haven't you? Didn't you have someone else stand?

03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:32.600
Ah, yes, thing I mean Bob, but it's alright. They left last week.

03:13:32.600 --> 03:13:35.600
That's okay then.

03:13:37.600 --> 03:13:43.600
Oh, you must have been thirsty. Would you like some more?

03:13:43.600 --> 03:13:45.600
Sure.

03:13:57.600 --> 03:14:02.600
Oh, are you coming up with me?

03:14:02.600 --> 03:14:05.600
That's nice, Nini.

03:14:12.600 --> 03:14:19.600
This is your very own room. You'll be warm and cozy here.

03:14:19.600 --> 03:14:25.600
I've put the lemonade on the table so you can have a drink whenever you want.

03:14:26.600 --> 03:14:30.600
Are you sure you wouldn't like something to eat?

03:14:30.600 --> 03:14:33.600
Ah, I see, you want to go to bed.

03:14:33.600 --> 03:14:36.600
Well, you had a busy day, so you must be tired out.

03:14:36.600 --> 03:14:40.600
And don't forget, if you feel frightened or lonely during the night,

03:14:40.600 --> 03:14:43.600
just come and wake me up and we'll have a talk.

03:14:43.600 --> 03:14:50.600
If you like, you can tinkle your little bell in my ear and that should do it many dear.

03:14:50.600 --> 03:14:54.600
Sweet dreams, sleep well.

03:14:57.600 --> 03:14:59.600
She asleep?

03:14:59.600 --> 03:15:02.600
Yes.

03:15:02.600 --> 03:15:08.600
I was wondering whether there's anything that might help her in your granny's book of household remedies.

03:15:08.600 --> 03:15:13.600
I don't know if there's a cure for invisibility. I can't remember, but I'll have a look.

03:15:13.600 --> 03:15:17.600
There's a remedy for most things.

03:15:17.600 --> 03:15:20.600
I'm a phone believer in granny's remedy.

03:15:20.600 --> 03:15:24.600
I know you are dear. I'll go and see.

03:15:24.600 --> 03:15:28.600
I wonder what you looked like.

03:15:28.600 --> 03:15:31.600
Hmm. Hmm.

03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:37.600
Ah, there it is.

03:15:37.600 --> 03:15:42.600
Now then, a droopy tail, evil eye, melancholy.

03:15:42.600 --> 03:15:45.600
Ah, this must be it.

03:15:55.600 --> 03:16:03.600
The prescription was at the end of the book and shakily written, but it looked like the right one.

03:16:03.600 --> 03:16:10.600
It said, remedy for when people start getting misty and difficult to see.

03:16:10.600 --> 03:16:14.600
It was very complicated.

03:16:25.600 --> 03:16:30.600
Do you think it's going to work, Mama?

03:16:30.600 --> 03:16:34.600
Granny's remedies usually do, so don't worry.

03:16:34.600 --> 03:16:36.600
Yes, you're right.

03:16:36.600 --> 03:16:40.600
I wonder whether we ought to go and wake her up.

03:16:55.600 --> 03:16:59.600
Look, you can send in these shoes.

03:17:10.600 --> 03:17:12.600
Papa! Papa!

03:17:12.600 --> 03:17:14.600
Oh, good morning, little Mai.

03:17:14.600 --> 03:17:16.600
Is Ninny up yet?

03:17:16.600 --> 03:17:18.600
Yeah, she is.

03:17:18.600 --> 03:17:21.600
Where is she? She hasn't eaten yet, has she?

03:17:21.600 --> 03:17:24.600
I don't know, and she's probably in the dining room.

03:17:24.600 --> 03:17:27.600
Oh, no!

03:17:33.600 --> 03:17:35.600
I'm too late!

03:17:35.600 --> 03:17:37.600
I'd be quiet, you two.

03:17:37.600 --> 03:17:40.600
Ninny is just finishing her breakfast.

03:17:40.600 --> 03:17:44.600
Come on, drink it all up.

03:17:46.600 --> 03:17:47.600
That's good.

03:17:47.600 --> 03:17:51.600
It should start to work in a couple of hours. Well done, Ninny.

03:17:51.600 --> 03:17:54.600
Look, her shoes are floating.

03:17:54.600 --> 03:17:57.600
Yeah, the seal will be seeing little bit seeing the rest of her.

03:17:57.600 --> 03:17:59.600
Ha, they look silly.

03:17:59.600 --> 03:18:01.600
I think they're very nice feet.

03:18:01.600 --> 03:18:05.600
I know and woman, Mama's remedies are good, but I can't see them working that fast.

03:18:05.600 --> 03:18:09.600
Anyway, you must look pretty bad if you want to make yourself invisible.

03:18:09.600 --> 03:18:13.600
Don't let little Mai upset you, Ninny. It's only the way she talks.

03:18:13.600 --> 03:18:14.600
She doesn't mean it.

03:18:14.600 --> 03:18:18.600
Oh, yes I do. I'm bored, Moomin.

03:18:18.600 --> 03:18:20.600
Well, what shall we do then, Moomin?

03:18:20.600 --> 03:18:23.600
I don't know. Let's go mushroom picking.

03:18:23.600 --> 03:18:25.600
That's boring, I never find any.

03:18:25.600 --> 03:18:27.600
Well, I do.

03:18:27.600 --> 03:18:29.600
Would you like to come, Ninny?

03:18:29.600 --> 03:18:33.600
Good, and we can see who can pick the most, shall we?

03:18:33.600 --> 03:18:38.600
They all look the same to me, so you'll have to tell me which ones are safe to eat.

03:18:41.600 --> 03:18:43.600
I'll tell you.

03:18:45.600 --> 03:18:48.600
Papa! Papa!

03:18:48.600 --> 03:18:51.600
Look Papa, you can see Ninny's shoes now.

03:18:51.600 --> 03:18:55.600
Oh, that's good. There's not many things Mama's potions won't cure.

03:18:55.600 --> 03:18:58.600
Oh, it can't be that. She only took it a minute ago.

03:18:58.600 --> 03:19:02.600
Well, it might be that it works faster if you're completely invisible.

03:19:02.600 --> 03:19:05.600
I think it's being away from that horrid ant.

03:19:05.600 --> 03:19:07.600
Yes, it could.

03:19:07.600 --> 03:19:10.600
Mama, we're taking Ninny mushroom picking.

03:19:10.600 --> 03:19:12.600
Have a nice time.

03:19:12.600 --> 03:19:14.600
Morning!

03:19:14.600 --> 03:19:16.600
Morning!

03:19:16.600 --> 03:19:18.600
Hello!

03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:21.600
Where's Ninny?

03:19:38.600 --> 03:19:41.600
Oh!

03:19:49.600 --> 03:19:52.600
Oh!

03:19:55.600 --> 03:19:58.600
Wow, what a lot of mushrooms!

03:20:02.600 --> 03:20:06.600
You seem to know where to find all the best ones, Ninny.

03:20:07.600 --> 03:20:10.600
It's not fair. I haven't gotten half as many.

03:20:10.600 --> 03:20:13.600
How are you doing, Momen?

03:20:13.600 --> 03:20:18.600
Wow, that must be about four times as many as I've got.

03:20:18.600 --> 03:20:21.600
Yeah, that's right.

03:20:21.600 --> 03:20:24.600
You've never picked that many before.

03:20:24.600 --> 03:20:28.600
You know, Momen, I think there's something fishy about this.

03:20:30.600 --> 03:20:33.600
Uh-huh, so they're not yours at all.

03:20:34.600 --> 03:20:37.600
Well, not really, no.

03:20:38.600 --> 03:20:40.600
Ninny's enjoyed herself.

03:20:40.600 --> 03:20:43.600
I'd better yak you old ant never let her go mushroom picking.

03:20:43.600 --> 03:20:47.600
She was probably only allowed to carry the baskets, the really heavy ones.

03:20:47.600 --> 03:20:50.600
Oh, how awful for her.

03:20:54.600 --> 03:20:57.600
They're stinky. What's he up to now?

03:20:57.600 --> 03:21:00.600
I'll take care of him.

03:21:00.600 --> 03:21:02.600
Hello, Momen, long time no see.

03:21:02.600 --> 03:21:06.600
Not long enough. Last time you dipped my swimming shorts in glue.

03:21:06.600 --> 03:21:09.600
You know, I thought that was very funny.

03:21:09.600 --> 03:21:12.600
Hey, what's that basket floating around up there for?

03:21:12.600 --> 03:21:15.600
I don't want to be rude, but mind your own business.

03:21:15.600 --> 03:21:17.600
It looks like the Hobgoblins work.

03:21:17.600 --> 03:21:20.600
Boy, just think of all the things you could do if you were invisible.

03:21:20.600 --> 03:21:23.600
Ninny, I'll carry your basket. Let's go.

03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:26.600
It stinks here.

03:21:26.600 --> 03:21:30.600
Hey, you! Is Ninny a name or just a description?

03:21:30.600 --> 03:21:33.600
What's wrong? Is your voice invisible, too?

03:21:33.600 --> 03:21:36.600
Please stop it, stinky. Can't you see you're frightening her?

03:21:36.600 --> 03:21:40.600
Oh, it's a girl, is it? Why doesn't she speak for herself?

03:21:40.600 --> 03:21:44.600
She's stupid. What a perfect name for her, Ninny.

03:21:44.600 --> 03:21:46.600
Now look, stinky.

03:21:46.600 --> 03:21:48.600
Oh, yes, Momen, now look what?

03:21:48.600 --> 03:21:52.600
You stop upsetting Ninny or I'll get really angry.

03:21:52.600 --> 03:21:55.600
Without those feet, she'd be perfect for a bank robbery.

03:21:55.600 --> 03:21:59.600
Well, she's getting visible again, so she'll be no good to you at all, stinky.

03:21:59.600 --> 03:22:02.600
You couldn't see any of her yesterday, not even the feet.

03:22:02.600 --> 03:22:05.600
Oh, they're disappearing again.

03:22:05.600 --> 03:22:08.600
You have to do a scare of it.

03:22:08.600 --> 03:22:12.600
Oh, see, she's gone.

03:22:12.600 --> 03:22:14.600
It's all your fault, stinky.

03:22:14.600 --> 03:22:18.600
Yes, and like I told you before, she'd make a brilliant bank robbery.

03:22:18.600 --> 03:22:22.600
Don't you agree? Perfect.

03:22:22.600 --> 03:22:25.600
Ninny would never do such a thing as that.

03:22:25.600 --> 03:22:28.600
Anyway, Mama's given her one of Granny's magic remedies.

03:22:28.600 --> 03:22:31.600
She'll soon be visible again, so they're there.

03:22:39.600 --> 03:22:41.600
Whose basket is this?

03:22:41.600 --> 03:22:43.600
Mine in little mice.

03:22:43.600 --> 03:22:46.600
Well, there's not many of them, but they certainly are pretty.

03:22:46.600 --> 03:22:51.600
There weren't many left for us to get, because Ninny has picked them all.

03:22:51.600 --> 03:22:54.600
It doesn't really matter how many you've got, because you can't eat them.

03:22:54.600 --> 03:22:57.600
Let me show you.

03:22:57.600 --> 03:22:59.600
Now, this is deadly, tufted toadstool.

03:22:59.600 --> 03:23:01.600
And this is cow's bane.

03:23:01.600 --> 03:23:05.600
You must remember what they look like.

03:23:05.600 --> 03:23:08.600
These are movements and sniff, I should think.

03:23:08.600 --> 03:23:10.600
We didn't pick any poisoners ones.

03:23:10.600 --> 03:23:14.600
Not quite as many as snorkemaiden and little mice, but this is body fly bane

03:23:14.600 --> 03:23:16.600
and insiduous pepper spunk.

03:23:16.600 --> 03:23:18.600
And you've both got cow's bane, too.

03:23:18.600 --> 03:23:20.600
You must be more careful.

03:23:20.600 --> 03:23:21.600
Now, this is better.

03:23:21.600 --> 03:23:24.600
There's not one mushroom in here that you can't eat.

03:23:24.600 --> 03:23:27.600
How did Ninny manage to do this all on her own?

03:23:27.600 --> 03:23:30.600
What a very clever girl she is.

03:23:30.600 --> 03:23:33.600
Ninny, where are you? Come here a minute.

03:23:33.600 --> 03:23:36.600
Ninny, didn't you hear? Mama wants you.

03:23:39.600 --> 03:23:42.600
Ninny, this is a beautiful mushroom basket.

03:23:42.600 --> 03:23:44.600
We'll have a feast tonight.

03:23:46.600 --> 03:23:48.600
Her feet have come back.

03:23:49.600 --> 03:23:51.600
Oh, I'm so glad.

03:23:51.600 --> 03:23:53.600
We'll soon be able to see your face.

03:23:53.600 --> 03:23:55.600
It won't take long at all, Ninny.

03:23:55.600 --> 03:23:58.600
And you mustn't worry about stinky one little bit.

03:23:58.600 --> 03:24:00.600
He's all talk.

03:24:00.600 --> 03:24:03.600
If something upsets you, just think of something else.

03:24:03.600 --> 03:24:06.600
At least that's my philosophy in life.

03:24:06.600 --> 03:24:08.600
If somebody upsets you, ignore him.

03:24:08.600 --> 03:24:10.600
That's my philosophy, Ninny.

03:24:10.600 --> 03:24:14.600
Anyone who picks mushrooms like this deserves to be seen.

03:24:14.600 --> 03:24:17.600
You mustn't let anything frighten you when you're with us.

03:24:17.600 --> 03:24:19.600
Do you understand?

03:24:22.600 --> 03:24:25.600
Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.

03:24:25.600 --> 03:24:27.600
That's just great, Ninny.

03:24:27.600 --> 03:24:29.600
Oh, that's wonderful, Ninny, wonderful.

03:24:29.600 --> 03:24:31.600
I can't wait to see all of you.

03:24:31.600 --> 03:24:33.600
It won't be long now.

03:24:33.600 --> 03:24:36.600
But I don't think Mouse Gray is quite your color, you know.

03:24:48.600 --> 03:24:50.600
You just sleep as long as you like, Ninny.

03:24:50.600 --> 03:24:51.600
Good night now.

03:24:51.600 --> 03:24:53.600
If you want anything, you just shout.

03:25:18.600 --> 03:25:19.600
Oh.

03:25:31.600 --> 03:25:33.600
Oh, where's Mom and Mama?

03:25:47.600 --> 03:25:52.600
Well, well, what are you doing?

03:25:52.600 --> 03:25:54.600
Do you know what time it is?

03:25:54.600 --> 03:25:56.600
Do you like this movement, Papa?

03:25:56.600 --> 03:25:57.600
Hmm.

03:25:57.600 --> 03:26:00.600
Yes, it's very nice.

03:26:00.600 --> 03:26:02.600
It's good to have someone in the house

03:26:02.600 --> 03:26:04.600
to make clothes for at last.

03:26:04.600 --> 03:26:06.600
I hope it'll look pretty on her.

03:26:06.600 --> 03:26:07.600
What's this for?

03:26:07.600 --> 03:26:08.600
Her hair.

03:26:18.600 --> 03:26:19.600
Oh!

03:26:39.600 --> 03:26:41.600
Good morning, movement, Papa!

03:26:41.600 --> 03:26:42.600
Good morning, little my.

03:26:42.600 --> 03:26:43.600
You're very early today.

03:26:43.600 --> 03:26:44.600
Where's Nini?

03:26:44.600 --> 03:26:46.600
Still in bed.

03:26:47.600 --> 03:26:48.600
You're a burly?

03:26:48.600 --> 03:26:50.600
I can't wait to see her.

03:26:50.600 --> 03:26:51.600
Come on, man.

03:26:57.600 --> 03:27:00.600
It's like waiting for Christmas, isn't it?

03:27:00.600 --> 03:27:03.600
Yeah, I like having presents every day.

03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:04.600
Isn't it, Papa?

03:27:04.600 --> 03:27:08.600
Well, I think it's much more exciting this way.

03:27:08.600 --> 03:27:11.600
We have to wait until she's ready to come down.

03:27:11.600 --> 03:27:14.600
Did you hear that door opening?

03:27:14.600 --> 03:27:16.600
She's awake!

03:27:17.600 --> 03:27:21.600
I hope she found the dress where I left it on the table.

03:27:22.600 --> 03:27:24.600
It's so hot!

03:27:42.600 --> 03:27:44.600
Oh, good.

03:27:44.600 --> 03:27:45.600
It's all right.

03:27:45.600 --> 03:27:47.600
Now you know where to look.

03:27:47.600 --> 03:27:52.600
Well, she's okay, I suppose.

03:27:57.600 --> 03:28:00.600
Thank you all very much for everything.

03:28:00.600 --> 03:28:04.600
Oh! Ha! So she can talk!

03:28:08.600 --> 03:28:10.600
They still couldn't see Nini's face,

03:28:10.600 --> 03:28:13.600
but at least they knew that she was there,

03:28:13.600 --> 03:28:15.600
and that she was talking to them.

03:28:15.600 --> 03:28:17.600
I made them all feel a lot better.

03:28:17.600 --> 03:28:19.600
Stork made them! Look!

03:28:45.600 --> 03:28:47.600
They're always happy and always at play.

03:28:47.600 --> 03:28:51.600
The movements are having fun day after day.

03:28:51.600 --> 03:28:54.600
The movements.

03:28:54.600 --> 03:28:57.600
The movements.

03:28:57.600 --> 03:29:02.600
They love the laughter and they love the living.

03:29:02.600 --> 03:29:05.600
The movements.

03:29:05.600 --> 03:29:10.600
You're leaving and sharing and caring and giving.

03:29:10.600 --> 03:29:12.600
The movements.

03:29:12.600 --> 03:29:16.600
They're always happy and always at play.

03:29:16.600 --> 03:29:20.600
The movements are having fun day after day.

03:29:20.600 --> 03:29:22.600
The movements.

03:29:22.600 --> 03:29:24.600
The movements.

03:29:24.600 --> 03:29:26.600
The movements.

03:29:26.600 --> 03:29:30.600
The movements.

03:29:30.600 --> 03:29:34.600
The movements.

03:29:34.600 --> 03:29:38.600
The movements.

03:29:38.600 --> 03:29:40.600
The movements.

03:30:08.600 --> 03:30:12.600
The movements.

03:30:12.600 --> 03:30:14.600
The movements.

03:30:14.600 --> 03:30:16.600
The movements.

03:30:16.600 --> 03:30:18.600
The movements.

03:30:18.600 --> 03:30:20.600
The movements.

03:30:20.600 --> 03:30:22.600
The movements.

03:30:22.600 --> 03:30:24.600
The movements.

03:30:24.600 --> 03:30:26.600
The movements.

03:30:26.600 --> 03:30:28.600
The movements.

03:30:28.600 --> 03:30:30.600
The movements.

03:30:30.600 --> 03:30:32.600
The movements.

03:30:32.600 --> 03:30:34.600
The movements.

03:30:34.600 --> 03:30:36.600
The movements.

03:30:36.600 --> 03:30:38.600
There were the movements.

03:30:38.600 --> 03:30:40.600
There was the movements.

03:30:40.600 --> 03:30:43.600
There was the movements.

03:30:43.600 --> 03:31:13.600

03:31:43.600 --> 03:31:45.600
Where's Danny?

03:31:45.600 --> 03:31:47.600
I asked her if she wanted to play with us,

03:31:47.600 --> 03:31:49.600
and she said yes!

03:31:51.600 --> 03:31:53.600
Danny, come on!

03:31:53.600 --> 03:31:55.600
We're going to have some fun!

03:32:07.600 --> 03:32:09.600
Right, let's go!

03:32:09.600 --> 03:32:15.600
Danny, who became invisible because of her sarcastic aunt,

03:32:15.600 --> 03:32:17.600
was now visible up to the neck.

03:32:17.600 --> 03:32:19.600
But no matter how much of Granny's remedy she took,

03:32:19.600 --> 03:32:21.600
or how nice the movements were to her,

03:32:21.600 --> 03:32:25.600
her hips still remained invisible.

03:32:25.600 --> 03:32:27.600
That's the invisible child.

03:32:27.600 --> 03:32:29.600
I wonder what she really looks like.

03:32:29.600 --> 03:32:31.600
Well, good morning, everybody!

03:32:31.600 --> 03:32:33.600
Morning, lazy bones!

03:32:33.600 --> 03:32:35.600
We've been up for hours and hours!

03:32:35.600 --> 03:32:37.600
We're going to play hide-and-seek in the woods!

03:32:37.600 --> 03:32:39.600
Great!

03:32:39.600 --> 03:32:41.600
Ninny, come on!

03:32:41.600 --> 03:32:43.600
We're going to play hide-and-seek in the woods!

03:32:43.600 --> 03:32:45.600
That's the invisible child!

03:32:45.600 --> 03:32:47.600
I wonder what she really looks like!

03:32:47.600 --> 03:32:49.600
Well, good morning, everybody!

03:32:49.600 --> 03:32:51.600
Morning, lazy bones!

03:32:51.600 --> 03:32:53.600
We've been up for hours and hours!

03:32:53.600 --> 03:32:55.600
Great!

03:32:55.600 --> 03:32:57.600
Ninny, are you all right?

03:32:57.600 --> 03:32:59.600
Yes, thanks!

03:32:59.600 --> 03:33:01.600
This is dumb!

03:33:01.600 --> 03:33:03.600
If I could see your face, I wouldn't have to ask!

03:33:03.600 --> 03:33:05.600
Doesn't help with you, Sniff!

03:33:05.600 --> 03:33:07.600
You always ask silly questions!

03:33:23.600 --> 03:33:27.600
It's a bit big for hide-and-seek, isn't it?

03:33:27.600 --> 03:33:31.600
But that's what's so good about it!

03:33:35.600 --> 03:33:37.600
Okay, this is a good place to start,

03:33:37.600 --> 03:33:39.600
but we've got a new rule for the game.

03:33:39.600 --> 03:33:41.600
Once you find somewhere to hide,

03:33:41.600 --> 03:33:43.600
you've got to stay in the same place,

03:33:43.600 --> 03:33:45.600
no moving about anyone.

03:33:45.600 --> 03:33:47.600
Do you understand, Ninny?

03:33:47.600 --> 03:33:49.600
Right, you're to go first, Sniff!

03:33:49.600 --> 03:33:51.600
Huh? Why isn't always me first?

03:33:51.600 --> 03:33:53.600
We'll have a practice for Ninny's sake,

03:33:53.600 --> 03:33:55.600
show her what to do.

03:33:55.600 --> 03:33:57.600
Uh, hide-and-seek is an easy game!

03:33:57.600 --> 03:33:59.600
Not for Ninny, it isn't!

03:33:59.600 --> 03:34:01.600
She's never played it before!

03:34:01.600 --> 03:34:03.600
What? Never ever?

03:34:03.600 --> 03:34:05.600
No, and not just hide-and-seek!

03:34:05.600 --> 03:34:07.600
She hasn't played any games at all!

03:34:07.600 --> 03:34:09.600
Not even when she was visible?

03:34:09.600 --> 03:34:11.600
No, nothing!

03:34:11.600 --> 03:34:13.600
Oh, that's terrible!

03:34:13.600 --> 03:34:15.600
So, will you go first?

03:34:15.600 --> 03:34:17.600
No, I won't!

03:34:17.600 --> 03:34:19.600
Count to 10 slowly,

03:34:19.600 --> 03:34:21.600
so you'll have plenty of time to find somewhere!

03:34:21.600 --> 03:34:23.600
One!

03:34:23.600 --> 03:34:25.600
Two!

03:34:25.600 --> 03:34:27.600
Three!

03:34:29.600 --> 03:34:31.600
Go on, Ninny, hurry up!

03:34:31.600 --> 03:34:33.600
Four!

03:34:35.600 --> 03:34:37.600
Five!

03:34:39.600 --> 03:34:41.600
I can still see you!

03:34:43.600 --> 03:34:45.600
Six!

03:34:47.600 --> 03:34:51.600
Seven!

03:34:51.600 --> 03:34:53.600
Good!

03:34:53.600 --> 03:34:55.600
Good!

03:34:55.600 --> 03:34:57.600
Eight!

03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:01.600
Nine!

03:35:05.600 --> 03:35:07.600
Two!

03:35:07.600 --> 03:35:09.600
Hello, Ninny!

03:35:09.600 --> 03:35:11.600
Don't be frightened!

03:35:11.600 --> 03:35:13.600
Why don't you hide in that bush over there?

03:35:13.600 --> 03:35:15.600
He'll never find you!

03:35:15.600 --> 03:35:17.600
I'm coming!

03:35:17.600 --> 03:35:19.600
Thank you!

03:35:33.600 --> 03:35:35.600
Ouch, my tail!

03:35:35.600 --> 03:35:37.600
Got you, Sniff!

03:35:37.600 --> 03:35:39.600
Eh!

03:35:45.600 --> 03:35:47.600
Huh?

03:35:49.600 --> 03:35:51.600
Huh?

03:35:51.600 --> 03:35:53.600
Huh?

03:35:57.600 --> 03:35:59.600
Hmm?

03:35:59.600 --> 03:36:01.600
Ah!

03:36:05.600 --> 03:36:07.600
Hehehe!

03:36:15.600 --> 03:36:17.600
Huh?

03:36:17.600 --> 03:36:19.600
Huh?

03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:29.600
Got you, Little Mike!

03:36:29.600 --> 03:36:31.600
No!

03:36:31.600 --> 03:36:33.600
I'd like to know where Ninny's hiding!

03:36:37.600 --> 03:36:39.600
Oh, look!

03:36:39.600 --> 03:36:41.600
Oh!

03:36:45.600 --> 03:36:47.600
Ah, come out, Ninny!

03:36:47.600 --> 03:36:49.600
I've got you!

03:36:49.600 --> 03:36:51.600
That was a good place, but I saw your ribbon!

03:36:51.600 --> 03:36:53.600
Oh!

03:36:53.600 --> 03:36:55.600
Now for Snort Maiden!

03:36:55.600 --> 03:36:57.600
She's always easy to find!

03:36:59.600 --> 03:37:01.600
Ha!

03:37:01.600 --> 03:37:03.600
That's only because she wants to be found!

03:37:03.600 --> 03:37:05.600
Found you, Snort Maiden!

03:37:05.600 --> 03:37:07.600
One!

03:37:11.600 --> 03:37:13.600
Two!

03:37:13.600 --> 03:37:17.600
Three!

03:37:17.600 --> 03:37:19.600
Don't wait, Ninny!

03:37:19.600 --> 03:37:21.600
This is my bush!

03:37:21.600 --> 03:37:25.600
Four!

03:37:29.600 --> 03:37:31.600
Hey, Ninny!

03:37:31.600 --> 03:37:33.600
I'll show you a good place!

03:37:33.600 --> 03:37:35.600
Just come with your ankles stinky!

03:37:43.600 --> 03:37:47.600
Now don't worry, no one will find you there!

03:37:47.600 --> 03:37:49.600
It opens up once you're inside!

03:37:49.600 --> 03:37:51.600
Come on!

03:37:51.600 --> 03:37:53.600
It's a bit steep, I'll help you!

03:38:01.600 --> 03:38:03.600
Oh!

03:38:07.600 --> 03:38:09.600
Right! That should keep you quiet!

03:38:09.600 --> 03:38:11.600
You're a bit too visible at the moment!

03:38:11.600 --> 03:38:13.600
Oh, let me out!

03:38:13.600 --> 03:38:17.600
But I'm sure if you stay here until tomorrow, no one will see it all!

03:38:17.600 --> 03:38:19.600
Please don't leave me here!

03:38:19.600 --> 03:38:21.600
Please!

03:38:29.600 --> 03:38:31.600
Ha! That's it!

03:38:31.600 --> 03:38:33.600
Now tomorrow we'll hit the bank!

03:38:41.600 --> 03:38:43.600
Let me out!

03:38:43.600 --> 03:38:45.600
Please let me out!

03:38:47.600 --> 03:38:51.600
I'm very glad I thought of bringing Ninny here!

03:38:51.600 --> 03:38:53.600
It's nice to have her here too, Tiki!

03:38:53.600 --> 03:38:55.600
She's no trouble at all!

03:38:55.600 --> 03:38:57.600
You're all pretty eccentric!

03:38:57.600 --> 03:39:01.600
And it might be just what she needs to make her want to be seen again!

03:39:01.600 --> 03:39:03.600
And you're very kind, of course!

03:39:03.600 --> 03:39:05.600
Well, thank you!

03:39:05.600 --> 03:39:07.600
I think I suppose we should be flattered, shouldn't we?

03:39:07.600 --> 03:39:09.600
Oh, yes, definitely!

03:39:09.600 --> 03:39:13.600
She started to talk, but her voice is very weak!

03:39:13.600 --> 03:39:15.600
You have to listen very carefully!

03:39:15.600 --> 03:39:17.600
Has it always been like that?

03:39:17.600 --> 03:39:19.600
Or just since she was invisible?

03:39:19.600 --> 03:39:21.600
I'm not sure I don't think it was like that before!

03:39:21.600 --> 03:39:25.600
Lots of people manage very well without using their heads, so I'm certain Ninny will be all right!

03:39:25.600 --> 03:39:29.600
Yes, and I'm glad she's got Moomin and the others to play with!

03:39:29.600 --> 03:39:31.600
She's never had anybody before, you know?

03:39:31.600 --> 03:39:35.600
I think she'd find it a bit difficult to Tiki!

03:39:35.600 --> 03:39:37.600
Well, Mum and Mama, I think that all she needs is something to shock her out of it!

03:39:37.600 --> 03:39:39.600
Huh, got you little, my!

03:39:39.600 --> 03:39:41.600
Oh! That bush was too prickly anyway!

03:39:41.600 --> 03:39:43.600
I expect I'm the last one, hey!

03:39:43.600 --> 03:39:45.600
No, I haven't found Ninny yet!

03:39:45.600 --> 03:39:47.600
Ninny!

03:39:47.600 --> 03:39:49.600
I didn't think Ninny would hide so well!

03:39:49.600 --> 03:39:51.600
And he lucked, Sniff!

03:39:51.600 --> 03:39:53.600
There's nowhere else to look, Moomin!

03:39:53.600 --> 03:39:55.600
Perhaps she's lost or fallen or hurt herself!

03:39:55.600 --> 03:39:57.600
Well, I've looked absolutely everywhere!

03:39:57.600 --> 03:39:59.600
I bet she's invisible again!

03:39:59.600 --> 03:40:01.600
That's why I can't find her!

03:40:01.600 --> 03:40:03.600
I bet, Sniff!

03:40:03.600 --> 03:40:05.600
I bet Sniff hasn't looked everywhere!

03:40:05.600 --> 03:40:07.600
She can't be far!

03:40:07.600 --> 03:40:09.600
Do you know where she is, Moomin?

03:40:09.600 --> 03:40:11.600
No, I haven't seen her at all!

03:40:11.600 --> 03:40:13.600
Not since we started!

03:40:15.600 --> 03:40:17.600
Ninny!

03:40:17.600 --> 03:40:19.600
Come on! We're going home!

03:40:19.600 --> 03:40:21.600
We've finished playing!

03:40:21.600 --> 03:40:23.600
Ninny!

03:40:23.600 --> 03:40:25.600
Oh, my goodness! Where could she be?

03:40:25.600 --> 03:40:27.600
Ninny!

03:40:27.600 --> 03:40:29.600
She's your turn, Sniff!

03:40:29.600 --> 03:40:31.600
You've got to find her!

03:40:31.600 --> 03:40:33.600
Never mind, we'll all look!

03:40:33.600 --> 03:40:35.600
We must find her!

03:40:35.600 --> 03:40:37.600
We are supposed to be looking after her, you know?

03:40:39.600 --> 03:40:41.600
Oh, come on, Ninny!

03:40:41.600 --> 03:40:43.600
The game's over!

03:40:43.600 --> 03:40:45.600
We've finished!

03:40:45.600 --> 03:40:47.600
Ninny!

03:40:47.600 --> 03:40:49.600
Ninny!

03:40:49.600 --> 03:40:51.600
Hurry up!

03:40:51.600 --> 03:40:55.600
We're going home for cookies and lemonade!

03:40:55.600 --> 03:40:57.600
Ninny!

03:40:57.600 --> 03:40:59.600
Ah!

03:41:05.600 --> 03:41:07.600
Ninny!

03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:09.600
Ninny!

03:41:09.600 --> 03:41:11.600
Can you hear us?

03:41:11.600 --> 03:41:13.600
We weren't supposed to come this far, Snort Maiden.

03:41:13.600 --> 03:41:17.600
She might be really lost or frightened or anything!

03:41:17.600 --> 03:41:19.600
Ninny!

03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:21.600
Where are you, Ninny?

03:41:21.600 --> 03:41:23.600
Can you hear me?

03:41:23.600 --> 03:41:25.600
Ninny!

03:41:25.600 --> 03:41:26.600
Help! I'm over here!

03:41:26.600 --> 03:41:30.600
Did you hear something?

03:41:30.600 --> 03:41:32.600
I'm not sure!

03:41:32.600 --> 03:41:34.600
Help! Help! I'm here!

03:41:34.600 --> 03:41:36.600
Help!

03:41:36.600 --> 03:41:38.600
That's her!

03:41:38.600 --> 03:41:40.600
She's not far away!

03:41:40.600 --> 03:41:42.600
Ninny! Where are you?

03:41:42.600 --> 03:41:44.600
Here! Behind this rock!

03:41:44.600 --> 03:41:46.600
Where's her voice coming from?

03:41:46.600 --> 03:41:48.600
That way, I think!

03:41:48.600 --> 03:41:50.600
Ninny!

03:41:50.600 --> 03:41:52.600
I can't hear what you're saying!

03:41:52.600 --> 03:41:54.600
Try and shout a bit louder!

03:41:54.600 --> 03:41:56.600
Over here! Over here!

03:41:56.600 --> 03:41:58.600
Behind the rock!

03:41:58.600 --> 03:42:00.600
I still can't hear properly!

03:42:00.600 --> 03:42:02.600
Louder, Ninny! Louder!

03:42:02.600 --> 03:42:04.600
Behind the rock!

03:42:04.600 --> 03:42:06.600
Which rock?

03:42:06.600 --> 03:42:08.600
Over here!

03:42:08.600 --> 03:42:10.600
The big rock!

03:42:10.600 --> 03:42:12.600
Over there!

03:42:12.600 --> 03:42:16.600
I've never shouted so much in my life!

03:42:16.600 --> 03:42:18.600
Ninny!

03:42:18.600 --> 03:42:22.600
Ninny, are you behind this rock, Ninny?

03:42:22.600 --> 03:42:24.600
Stinky block the cave with it!

03:42:24.600 --> 03:42:26.600
Don't worry, we'll get you out!

03:42:26.600 --> 03:42:28.600
Hang on!

03:42:34.600 --> 03:42:36.600
Are you all right, Ninny?

03:42:36.600 --> 03:42:38.600
Thank you, Mummin!

03:42:38.600 --> 03:42:40.600
Oh, thank you!

03:42:40.600 --> 03:42:42.600
Your voice seems to be...

03:42:42.600 --> 03:42:44.600
Oh, what?

03:42:44.600 --> 03:42:46.600
Oh, nothing!

03:42:46.600 --> 03:42:48.600
Try and hold on to me, and I'll pull you out!

03:42:48.600 --> 03:42:50.600
Oh, thank you!

03:42:50.600 --> 03:42:52.600
Oh, thank you!

03:42:56.600 --> 03:42:58.600
Hey, what's happened?

03:42:58.600 --> 03:43:00.600
Where'd you find her?

03:43:00.600 --> 03:43:02.600
In the cave!

03:43:02.600 --> 03:43:06.600
Wow, what a brilliant hiding place had you find it!

03:43:06.600 --> 03:43:08.600
What's wrong?

03:43:08.600 --> 03:43:10.600
Did I say something funny?

03:43:12.600 --> 03:43:14.600
Now, that was very mean of stinking.

03:43:14.600 --> 03:43:18.600
The clever idea, though, of interuser for a ban robbery.

03:43:18.600 --> 03:43:20.600
Oh, Papa!

03:43:20.600 --> 03:43:22.600
Oh, I know Stinky shouldn't have done it,

03:43:22.600 --> 03:43:24.600
and it must have been a nasty shopping,

03:43:24.600 --> 03:43:26.600
trapped in the dark in that cave,

03:43:26.600 --> 03:43:28.600
but no real harm came to her,

03:43:28.600 --> 03:43:30.600
and she didn't disappear,

03:43:30.600 --> 03:43:32.600
and her voice got much stronger.

03:43:32.600 --> 03:43:34.600
Because she yelled so loud!

03:43:34.600 --> 03:43:36.600
Goodness, did you, dear?

03:43:36.600 --> 03:43:38.600
Yes, Mummin, Mama!

03:43:38.600 --> 03:43:40.600
Mummin told me to yell loudly,

03:43:40.600 --> 03:43:42.600
so he'd know where I was!

03:43:42.600 --> 03:43:44.600
And it was loud, too!

03:43:44.600 --> 03:43:46.600
Good for you, Ninny!

03:43:46.600 --> 03:43:48.600
You have to, and you ought to remember,

03:43:48.600 --> 03:43:52.600
that people who speak loudly are usually very noticeable.

03:43:52.600 --> 03:43:54.600
Go on, yell! I want to see it!

03:43:54.600 --> 03:43:56.600
That's a good idea, Ninny!

03:43:56.600 --> 03:43:58.600
If shouting brought back your voice,

03:43:58.600 --> 03:44:00.600
you never know it might be just what's needed

03:44:00.600 --> 03:44:02.600
to make the rest of you visible!

03:44:02.600 --> 03:44:04.600
Try and get angry as well!

03:44:04.600 --> 03:44:06.600
Yeah, that's easy! Just think about Stinky!

03:44:06.600 --> 03:44:08.600
Yeah, and how horrible he is!

03:44:08.600 --> 03:44:10.600
That should make you angry!

03:44:10.600 --> 03:44:12.600
Very angry!

03:44:12.600 --> 03:44:14.600
Just you wait, Stinky!

03:44:14.600 --> 03:44:16.600
I can't help faster than me!

03:44:20.600 --> 03:44:22.600
Stinky, wait!

03:44:22.600 --> 03:44:24.600
We want to talk to you!

03:44:24.600 --> 03:44:26.600
I don't want to talk to you!

03:44:28.600 --> 03:44:30.600
Are you all right, Sniff?

03:44:32.600 --> 03:44:34.600
She can't get away, Stinky!

03:44:34.600 --> 03:44:36.600
The forest is my home ground!

03:44:36.600 --> 03:44:38.600
You won't catch me in here!

03:44:42.600 --> 03:44:44.600
I did it!

03:44:44.600 --> 03:44:46.600
Hold it!

03:44:46.600 --> 03:44:48.600
Hold it!

03:44:54.600 --> 03:44:56.600
You can't do this to me!

03:44:56.600 --> 03:44:58.600
We're only doing what you did to Ninny!

03:44:58.600 --> 03:45:00.600
Now look, I needed her to help me!

03:45:00.600 --> 03:45:02.600
I did, I tell ya!

03:45:02.600 --> 03:45:04.600
But she didn't want to, huh?

03:45:04.600 --> 03:45:08.600
That's why I put her down this hole to change her mind!

03:45:08.600 --> 03:45:10.600
And scare her so much that she'd become totally invisible again!

03:45:10.600 --> 03:45:12.600
She had to be invisible for my plan!

03:45:12.600 --> 03:45:14.600
Now get me out of here!

03:45:14.600 --> 03:45:16.600
It's all right, Stinky! See you tomorrow!

03:45:16.600 --> 03:45:18.600
No!

03:45:22.600 --> 03:45:24.600
You crushed few thieves!

03:45:24.600 --> 03:45:26.600
I had such a wonderful plan!

03:45:26.600 --> 03:45:28.600
Ah!

03:45:28.600 --> 03:45:30.600
Ah! You're spiteful!

03:45:30.600 --> 03:45:32.600
Let's hear them my next job!

03:45:32.600 --> 03:45:34.600
But despite all that had happened,

03:45:34.600 --> 03:45:38.600
Ninny's face was still not to be seen.

03:45:38.600 --> 03:45:40.600
Then, about ten days later.

03:45:54.600 --> 03:45:58.600
This weather seems to push the nails out.

03:45:58.600 --> 03:46:02.600
I haven't seen anyone stare at the sea like Ninny does.

03:46:02.600 --> 03:46:06.600
Well, maybe she's never seen it before!

03:46:06.600 --> 03:46:08.600
Ah!

03:46:08.600 --> 03:46:10.600
Ah!

03:46:10.600 --> 03:46:12.600
Ah!

03:46:12.600 --> 03:46:14.600
Oh, she's crying now!

03:46:28.600 --> 03:46:30.600
What's the matter?

03:46:30.600 --> 03:46:32.600
It's the sea!

03:46:32.600 --> 03:46:34.600
It's far too big!

03:46:34.600 --> 03:46:38.600
You don't have to go on it, you know.

03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:42.600
Mama! Mama! What's up?

03:46:42.600 --> 03:46:44.600
Hmm?

03:46:44.600 --> 03:46:46.600
What's the matter with her?

03:46:46.600 --> 03:46:48.600
Nothing to worry about.

03:46:48.600 --> 03:46:50.600
She's never seen the sea before,

03:46:50.600 --> 03:46:54.600
and she's just surprised at how big it is.

03:46:56.600 --> 03:47:00.600
Well, there's an awful lot of water, that's for sure.

03:47:00.600 --> 03:47:02.600
Ah!

03:47:06.600 --> 03:47:08.600
Ninny's lucky.

03:47:08.600 --> 03:47:10.600
I wish there was something to surprise or excite me.

03:47:10.600 --> 03:47:12.600
Nothing's happened for weeks.

03:47:12.600 --> 03:47:14.600
Anything would be nice.

03:47:14.600 --> 03:47:16.600
Mama must be bored.

03:47:16.600 --> 03:47:18.600
I think you're right.

03:47:18.600 --> 03:47:20.600
But she never gets bored.

03:47:20.600 --> 03:47:22.600
Well, she is now. She needs something to happen.

03:47:22.600 --> 03:47:24.600
I think we should do something to surprise her.

03:47:24.600 --> 03:47:26.600
Like what?

03:47:26.600 --> 03:47:28.600
Well, I know what we can do.

03:47:28.600 --> 03:47:30.600
Tell me.

03:47:30.600 --> 03:47:32.600
We'll creep up behind her and just give her a little push.

03:47:32.600 --> 03:47:34.600
What, Papa?

03:47:34.600 --> 03:47:36.600
Push her into the sea?

03:47:36.600 --> 03:47:38.600
Oh, Papa, you can't. Mama wouldn't like it.

03:47:38.600 --> 03:47:40.600
Just watch me.

03:47:40.600 --> 03:47:42.600
But the water's freezing. A mama will get all wet.

03:47:42.600 --> 03:47:44.600
We never found the water too cold when we were your age.

03:47:44.600 --> 03:47:46.600
You young people today have no sense of fun.

03:47:46.600 --> 03:47:48.600
Did you really used to do things like that?

03:47:48.600 --> 03:47:50.600
All the time.

03:47:50.600 --> 03:47:52.600
Papa?

03:47:52.600 --> 03:47:54.600
Yes, Mumann.

03:47:54.600 --> 03:47:56.600
Oh, nothing.

03:47:56.600 --> 03:48:00.600
She's a prank. She'll find it very funny. I promise.

03:48:01.600 --> 03:48:02.600
Oh!

03:48:23.600 --> 03:48:26.600
Papa, you're dead!

03:48:26.600 --> 03:48:28.600
Dow?

03:48:28.600 --> 03:48:31.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:48:34.600 --> 03:48:37.600
Don't you dare push your end to that big horrible scene.

03:48:37.600 --> 03:48:38.600
Let me explain to you.

03:48:38.600 --> 03:48:40.600
There's nothing to explain.

03:48:40.600 --> 03:48:41.600
You're a big bully.

03:48:41.600 --> 03:48:43.600
She didn't go to a wet.

03:48:43.600 --> 03:48:45.600
What a nasty trick.

03:48:45.600 --> 03:48:48.600
You could never, never.

03:48:48.600 --> 03:48:50.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:48:50.600 --> 03:48:52.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:48:52.600 --> 03:48:54.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:48:54.600 --> 03:48:56.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:48:56.600 --> 03:48:58.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:48:58.600 --> 03:49:00.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:49:00.600 --> 03:49:02.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:49:02.600 --> 03:49:04.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:49:04.600 --> 03:49:05.600
There's your face!

03:49:05.600 --> 03:49:06.600
Hurry!

03:49:06.600 --> 03:49:07.600
Hurry!

03:49:07.600 --> 03:49:09.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:49:09.600 --> 03:49:12.600
That's the last thing to see you.

03:49:12.600 --> 03:49:15.600
What on earth happened?

03:49:15.600 --> 03:49:16.600
Were you up to something?

03:49:16.600 --> 03:49:17.600
Oh, nothing much?

03:49:17.600 --> 03:49:20.600
You know, that child has got the sharpest teeth

03:49:20.600 --> 03:49:22.600
with her without her head.

03:49:22.600 --> 03:49:25.600
Oh, woman, woman, at last I'm visible again.

03:49:25.600 --> 03:49:27.600
We're always, you won't disappear again.

03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:29.600
Never, I'll never.

03:49:29.600 --> 03:49:30.600
Brave girl.

03:49:30.600 --> 03:49:33.600
And with a good strong set of healthy teeth, too.

03:49:33.600 --> 03:49:35.600
Oh, I'm so happy, nanny.

03:49:35.600 --> 03:49:37.600
Me, me, dear.

03:49:39.600 --> 03:49:41.600
I'm very glad, too.

03:49:41.600 --> 03:49:49.600
Oh, oh, oh.

03:49:49.600 --> 03:49:57.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:49:57.600 --> 03:50:03.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:50:03.600 --> 03:50:06.600
And you?

03:50:06.600 --> 03:50:08.600
Stop laughing, you horrible child,

03:50:08.600 --> 03:50:10.600
Child, you use Sirtooth monster.

03:50:15.600 --> 03:50:17.600
What's so funny, huh?

03:50:17.600 --> 03:50:18.600
Really?

03:50:37.600 --> 03:50:39.600
Really? Ninny laughed?

03:50:40.600 --> 03:50:43.600
Well, she certainly changed, Mum and Mama.

03:50:43.600 --> 03:50:46.600
All she needed was to get angry, and she did.

03:50:46.600 --> 03:50:48.600
I hope Mum and Papa's forgiven Ninny.

03:50:48.600 --> 03:50:51.600
Thank you all for taking such good care of her.

03:50:51.600 --> 03:50:55.600
I hate to say it, but she sounds almost as bad as it'll mind now.

03:50:56.600 --> 03:50:59.600
Tiki! Ninny!

03:51:04.600 --> 03:51:07.600
And so Ninny left Mum and House with Tiki.

03:51:07.600 --> 03:51:11.600
Now that she was completely visible and far from timid,

03:51:11.600 --> 03:51:13.600
she was ready for anything.

03:51:13.600 --> 03:51:17.600
Anything that is except seeing her aunt, she said.

03:52:43.600 --> 03:52:57.600
The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves!

03:53:13.600 --> 03:53:14.600
The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves

03:53:43.600 --> 03:54:13.600
The Moves! The Moves! The Moves! The Moves!

03:54:13.600 --> 03:54:43.600
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

03:54:43.600 --> 03:55:13.600
Snort Maiden is running as if the groke is chasing her. I don't think I've ever seen her run so fast. I wonder what's the matter? Perhaps something terrible has happened.

03:55:13.600 --> 03:55:43.600
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom

03:55:43.600 --> 03:56:13.600
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom

03:56:13.600 --> 03:56:43.600
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom

03:56:43.600 --> 03:57:13.600
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom

03:57:13.600 --> 03:57:38.600
A snork? Wait! Wait! Please! Stop! Snork! Don't do it! Why have you brought everybody here, snork maiden?

03:57:38.600 --> 03:57:44.600
They've come to beg you not to do it! You're too young and brilliant for such a tragic end. Thank the bobble we were in time!

03:57:44.600 --> 03:57:51.600
As a matter of fact, you weren't. Oh, really? It looks very dangerous to me, snork.

03:57:51.600 --> 03:57:56.600
Well, it's not a tall woman, Papa. I made these wings myself. They're perfectly balanced.

03:57:56.600 --> 03:57:59.600
Well, yes, I'm sure they are, but...

03:57:59.600 --> 03:58:03.600
The blueprints are detailed and precise. They're quite safe.

03:58:03.600 --> 03:58:08.600
Tell me, snork. Why did you stop on the edge like that after running down the slope?

03:58:08.600 --> 03:58:12.600
I was measuring the right length for my approach run.

03:58:12.600 --> 03:58:15.600
Don't do it, snork. I don't want to lose my only brother.

03:58:15.600 --> 03:58:17.600
Don't make such a fuss, snork maiden.

03:58:17.600 --> 03:58:23.600
Do you really think it's safe? Of course it is. You don't see birds falling out of the sky, do you?

03:58:23.600 --> 03:58:29.600
Well, at least. Do your test flight just above the ground so that if something happens to go wrong,

03:58:29.600 --> 03:58:34.600
I've already done that from the roof of our house and it worked beautifully.

03:58:34.600 --> 03:58:37.600
Did you see him? No, I didn't see anything.

03:58:37.600 --> 03:58:41.600
Of course you didn't. Do you think I let a wimpy little sister watch me?

03:58:41.600 --> 03:58:43.600
What's that supposed to mean, snork?

03:58:43.600 --> 03:58:47.600
Just that I don't want you sticking your big nose into my affairs all the time.

03:58:47.600 --> 03:58:49.600
I don't like it and there's nothing to do with you.

03:58:49.600 --> 03:58:52.600
Yours is just as big and I don't want to lose you.

03:58:52.600 --> 03:58:55.600
Don't go on about losing me. Why not?

03:58:55.600 --> 03:58:57.600
Come on now, you two. Stop it.

03:58:57.600 --> 03:58:59.600
Hey, careful.

03:58:59.600 --> 03:59:03.600
Oops, that was close. Snork maiden, I don't think your brother is going to be stopped.

03:59:03.600 --> 03:59:05.600
Oh dear, oh dear.

03:59:05.600 --> 03:59:07.600
You're very brave, snork.

03:59:09.600 --> 03:59:13.600
Hmm, right. Here we go.

03:59:13.600 --> 03:59:17.600
This time it will be a perfect takeoff.

03:59:17.600 --> 03:59:21.600
It's a long way. Oh look, isn't that snuffkin down there?

03:59:21.600 --> 03:59:24.600
Where? Where is he? Where's snuffkin?

03:59:24.600 --> 03:59:28.600
You can't see him from there, Sniff. You'll have to come here.

03:59:28.600 --> 03:59:30.600
Is it really snuffkin?

03:59:30.600 --> 03:59:34.600
Yes, I'm sure it is. Snuffkin!

03:59:34.600 --> 03:59:36.600
Yeah!

03:59:36.600 --> 03:59:38.600
Baby, here you.

03:59:38.600 --> 03:59:40.600
No, I don't think so.

03:59:40.600 --> 03:59:42.600
All right, here goes.

03:59:42.600 --> 03:59:44.600
Good luck, snork.

03:59:54.600 --> 03:59:56.600
Here.

04:00:00.600 --> 04:00:02.600
He's flying!

04:00:02.600 --> 04:00:04.600
I...

04:00:08.600 --> 04:00:10.600
Whoa!

04:00:22.600 --> 04:00:24.600
It's the snork!

04:00:32.600 --> 04:00:34.600
Hey!

04:00:46.600 --> 04:00:48.600
Look at him flying.

04:00:48.600 --> 04:00:50.600
It's all right, snork maiden.

04:00:50.600 --> 04:00:52.600
Your brother's doing fine. Come and see.

04:00:54.600 --> 04:00:56.600
He's done it! He's done it!

04:00:56.600 --> 04:01:00.600
Whoa, I knew he could do it.

04:01:00.600 --> 04:01:02.600
Well, so did I, to be honest.

04:01:02.600 --> 04:01:06.600
Huh? Yeah, snork!

04:01:10.600 --> 04:01:12.600
Hello!

04:01:12.600 --> 04:01:14.600
Hi! How are you doing?

04:01:14.600 --> 04:01:16.600
How are you doing?

04:01:16.600 --> 04:01:20.600
It's great that this test line is a great success.

04:01:30.600 --> 04:01:36.600
Okay, just as I thought he can't fly in wave at the same time.

04:01:36.600 --> 04:01:38.600
Interesting.

04:01:38.600 --> 04:01:40.600
That was mean, stinky.

04:01:40.600 --> 04:01:44.600
If I could get him to wave with both arms, he'd probably fall.

04:01:44.600 --> 04:01:46.600
Look, we don't want you here, stinky.

04:01:46.600 --> 04:01:48.600
Why don't you just go away?

04:01:48.600 --> 04:01:52.600
I can find lots to do with that machine.

04:01:52.600 --> 04:01:54.600
If you won't go away, I will.

04:01:54.600 --> 04:01:56.600
Well, go on then, Snuffkin.

04:01:56.600 --> 04:01:58.600
What do I care what you do?

04:01:58.600 --> 04:02:00.600
Hmm, that would be perfect for robberies.

04:02:00.600 --> 04:02:04.600
The wind seems to be taking him out to sea.

04:02:04.600 --> 04:02:06.600
Why doesn't he turn around and come back?

04:02:06.600 --> 04:02:08.600
Turning in that thing might not be so easy.

04:02:08.600 --> 04:02:10.600
What, do you mean he can't?

04:02:10.600 --> 04:02:12.600
I'm not sure.

04:02:12.600 --> 04:02:14.600
I'm not sure.

04:02:14.600 --> 04:02:16.600
I'm not sure.

04:02:16.600 --> 04:02:18.600
I'm not sure.

04:02:18.600 --> 04:02:20.600
Turning in that thing might not be so easy.

04:02:20.600 --> 04:02:22.600
What, do you mean he can't?

04:02:22.600 --> 04:02:24.600
Don't worry, Snuffkin made him.

04:02:24.600 --> 04:02:26.600
Of course he can.

04:02:26.600 --> 04:02:30.600
What's this I can't turn around?

04:02:30.600 --> 04:02:32.600
Oh!

04:02:32.600 --> 04:02:34.600
Oh!

04:02:34.600 --> 04:02:36.600
Oh!

04:02:36.600 --> 04:02:38.600
Oh!

04:02:38.600 --> 04:02:40.600
Oh!

04:02:40.600 --> 04:02:42.600
Oh, he's hit a tree.

04:02:42.600 --> 04:02:44.600
Come on, hurry.

04:02:48.600 --> 04:02:50.600
Oh!

04:02:50.600 --> 04:02:52.600
Oh!

04:02:52.600 --> 04:02:54.600
Oh!

04:02:54.600 --> 04:02:56.600
Oh!

04:02:56.600 --> 04:02:58.600
Oh!

04:02:58.600 --> 04:03:00.600
Oh!

04:03:00.600 --> 04:03:02.600
Oh!

04:03:02.600 --> 04:03:04.600
Oh!

04:03:04.600 --> 04:03:08.600
Is he dead?

04:03:08.600 --> 04:03:10.600
No, he's been knocked out.

04:03:10.600 --> 04:03:12.600
He looks dead to me anyway.

04:03:12.600 --> 04:03:14.600
Where are they?

04:03:14.600 --> 04:03:16.600
What's happened to the wings?

04:03:16.600 --> 04:03:18.600
Ah!

04:03:18.600 --> 04:03:20.600
He won't want them anymore.

04:03:20.600 --> 04:03:22.600
So now I can have them.

04:03:22.600 --> 04:03:24.600
Now, let me see.

04:03:40.600 --> 04:03:44.600
So, did the test fly go all right?

04:03:44.600 --> 04:03:46.600
Tell me what happened.

04:03:46.600 --> 04:03:50.600
Well, it was fine until the very end.

04:03:50.600 --> 04:03:54.600
I'm sure that you only need a bit more practice.

04:03:54.600 --> 04:03:56.600
Flying isn't the easiest thing to master, you know.

04:03:56.600 --> 04:03:58.600
I expect so.

04:03:58.600 --> 04:04:00.600
Let's hope you don't run out of bandages, though.

04:04:00.600 --> 04:04:02.600
Excuse me, snork.

04:04:02.600 --> 04:04:04.600
Hmm?

04:04:04.600 --> 04:04:06.600
Are you going to use the wings anymore?

04:04:06.600 --> 04:04:08.600
I might not.

04:04:08.600 --> 04:04:10.600
Why?

04:04:10.600 --> 04:04:12.600
Well, I'll have them if you don't want them.

04:04:12.600 --> 04:04:14.600
I want to fly in the sky, too.

04:04:14.600 --> 04:04:16.600
It looks the most exciting thing I've ever seen.

04:04:16.600 --> 04:04:18.600
Oh, please let me have them.

04:04:18.600 --> 04:04:20.600
Well, it's not as simple as that, movement.

04:04:20.600 --> 04:04:24.600
They need testing before the design is complete.

04:04:24.600 --> 04:04:26.600
But I could do that, snork.

04:04:26.600 --> 04:04:28.600
I know I could do it.

04:04:28.600 --> 04:04:30.600
Please let me have them.

04:04:30.600 --> 04:04:32.600
Well, I suppose I could do with some help.

04:04:32.600 --> 04:04:34.600
There's a lot to do, fetching and carrying mostly.

04:04:34.600 --> 04:04:38.600
You haven't said if I can have the wings or not yet, snork.

04:04:38.600 --> 04:04:40.600
Yes, you can, but on one condition.

04:04:40.600 --> 04:04:44.600
Well, now the blueprints are finished and the wings are more or less right.

04:04:44.600 --> 04:04:46.600
I'll need somewhere to build the ship.

04:04:46.600 --> 04:04:50.600
And somewhere to store all the materials so they'll be dry and at hand.

04:04:50.600 --> 04:04:52.600
Yes, you will snork.

04:04:52.600 --> 04:04:54.600
I can see that.

04:04:54.600 --> 04:04:56.600
It doesn't have to be much.

04:04:56.600 --> 04:04:58.600
Just a roof will do.

04:04:58.600 --> 04:05:00.600
Or, and walls.

04:05:00.600 --> 04:05:02.600
So that people can't spy on me and steal my ideas.

04:05:02.600 --> 04:05:04.600
I can do the building myself.

04:05:04.600 --> 04:05:06.600
But I'll need some help.

04:05:06.600 --> 04:05:08.600
And when it's finished, you can have the wings.

04:05:08.600 --> 04:05:10.600
I have to help you.

04:05:10.600 --> 04:05:14.600
I'd have done that anyway, but now that I can have the wings all worked twice as hard.

04:05:14.600 --> 04:05:16.600
You won't regret it, snork.

04:05:16.600 --> 04:05:18.600
I promise you you won't.

04:05:18.600 --> 04:05:20.600
Splendid, woman.

04:05:20.600 --> 04:05:22.600
That's settled then.

04:05:22.600 --> 04:05:24.600
Perhaps we can get more help.

04:05:24.600 --> 04:05:26.600
I'm sure that'd be easy.

04:05:26.600 --> 04:05:28.600
How about it, Snuffkin?

04:05:28.600 --> 04:05:30.600
Yes, of course.

04:05:30.600 --> 04:05:32.600
Will you help us do Sniff?

04:05:32.600 --> 04:05:34.600
Yes, but I want something too.

04:05:34.600 --> 04:05:36.600
I'll let you borrow the wings.

04:05:36.600 --> 04:05:38.600
I only break them.

04:05:38.600 --> 04:05:40.600
Don't worry, Sniff.

04:05:40.600 --> 04:05:42.600
I'm sure I'll think of something you can have.

04:05:42.600 --> 04:05:44.600
Oh, as long as it's something nice.

04:05:44.600 --> 04:05:46.600
Oh, I do love helping people.

04:05:46.600 --> 04:05:48.600
You're all hard, Sniff.

04:05:48.600 --> 04:05:50.600
We know that, for sure.

04:05:54.600 --> 04:05:58.600
I'm sure you'll need some expert help with the shed, snork.

04:06:06.600 --> 04:06:10.600
Surely this must be deep enough, Papa?

04:06:10.600 --> 04:06:12.600
Oh, no.

04:06:12.600 --> 04:06:14.600
We moments always build for posterity.

04:06:14.600 --> 04:06:16.600
Besides, I like pouring cement.

04:06:16.600 --> 04:06:18.600
Okay, Papa.

04:06:18.600 --> 04:06:20.600
Hey, Papa.

04:06:34.600 --> 04:06:38.600
I've given your present a lot of fortune, though.

04:06:38.600 --> 04:06:42.600
And I think I'll give you one of my invaluable books on machinery.

04:06:42.600 --> 04:06:44.600
Oh?

04:06:44.600 --> 04:06:46.600
Don't you want it?

04:06:46.600 --> 04:06:50.600
Well, if there was something else, I'm not much of a reader.

04:06:50.600 --> 04:06:54.600
What about my invaluable fountain pen?

04:06:54.600 --> 04:06:56.600
Invaluable fountain pen?

04:06:56.600 --> 04:06:58.600
What about my invaluable...

04:06:58.600 --> 04:07:00.600
Do you have anything that's not invaluable, Snork?

04:07:00.600 --> 04:07:04.600
Well, what about a gold coin?

04:07:04.600 --> 04:07:06.600
Well, that sounds great.

04:07:06.600 --> 04:07:08.600
A real gold coin?

04:07:08.600 --> 04:07:10.600
Oh, boy.

04:07:16.600 --> 04:07:18.600
Hey.

04:07:30.600 --> 04:07:32.600
You are digging a very deep hole.

04:07:32.600 --> 04:07:36.600
Oh, why don't you stop and have some sandwiches?

04:07:36.600 --> 04:07:38.600
Should we do that, Papa? Go on.

04:07:38.600 --> 04:07:40.600
Yes, I think we can stop now.

04:07:40.600 --> 04:07:42.600
Sniff and your brother in the woods.

04:07:42.600 --> 04:07:44.600
Yes, I know. I hurt them.

04:07:46.600 --> 04:07:48.600
Hi, Snork Maiden.

04:07:48.600 --> 04:07:50.600
Oh, no.

04:07:50.600 --> 04:07:52.600
Wait a minute, I want to ask you something.

04:07:52.600 --> 04:07:54.600
What is it?

04:07:54.600 --> 04:07:56.600
Tell me, Snork Maiden.

04:07:56.600 --> 04:07:58.600
Is it true that your brother gave those wings to a woman?

04:07:58.600 --> 04:08:02.600
Yes, it is. He's helping Snork to build the shed his payment.

04:08:02.600 --> 04:08:04.600
I thought they'd been broken up.

04:08:04.600 --> 04:08:06.600
They hit that tree very hard.

04:08:06.600 --> 04:08:08.600
Well, my brother's repairing them.

04:08:08.600 --> 04:08:10.600
Will you let me pass?

04:08:10.600 --> 04:08:12.600
I've got to take his lunch to him.

04:08:12.600 --> 04:08:14.600
And will he be able to repair them?

04:08:14.600 --> 04:08:16.600
He can repair anything.

04:08:16.600 --> 04:08:18.600
Mmm.

04:08:18.600 --> 04:08:20.600
Gosh, what a lot of wood you've got.

04:08:20.600 --> 04:08:24.600
Well, the shed has to be a lot bigger than my flying ship.

04:08:24.600 --> 04:08:26.600
Moomin' and Moomin' Papa are digging holes.

04:08:26.600 --> 04:08:28.600
They sure are deep.

04:08:28.600 --> 04:08:30.600
Oh, boy.

04:08:30.600 --> 04:08:32.600
Oh, boy.

04:08:32.600 --> 04:08:34.600
It'll be a lot bigger than my flying ship.

04:08:34.600 --> 04:08:38.600
Moomin' and Moomin' Papa are digging holes. They sure are deep.

04:08:38.600 --> 04:08:42.600
Everybody's being very kind, very kind indeed.

04:08:44.600 --> 04:08:48.600
Mama's cooking and Snuffkin's gone to get nails.

04:08:48.600 --> 04:08:52.600
There are some other things I need him to get as well.

04:08:52.600 --> 04:08:54.600
Will you write them down?

04:08:54.600 --> 04:08:56.600
Of course, I will, Snork.

04:08:56.600 --> 04:08:58.600
Oh, you're such a planner.

04:08:58.600 --> 04:09:00.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:00.600 --> 04:09:02.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:02.600 --> 04:09:04.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:04.600 --> 04:09:06.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:06.600 --> 04:09:08.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:08.600 --> 04:09:10.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:10.600 --> 04:09:12.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:12.600 --> 04:09:14.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:14.600 --> 04:09:16.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:16.600 --> 04:09:18.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:18.600 --> 04:09:20.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:20.600 --> 04:09:22.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:22.600 --> 04:09:24.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:24.600 --> 04:09:26.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:26.600 --> 04:09:28.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:28.600 --> 04:09:30.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:30.600 --> 04:09:32.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:32.600 --> 04:09:34.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:34.600 --> 04:09:36.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:36.600 --> 04:09:38.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:38.600 --> 04:09:40.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:40.600 --> 04:09:42.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:42.600 --> 04:09:44.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:44.600 --> 04:09:46.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:46.600 --> 04:09:48.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:48.600 --> 04:09:50.600
Oh, I'm afraid.

04:09:56.600 --> 04:09:58.600
Hey, what's up?

04:09:58.600 --> 04:10:00.600
The...

04:10:00.600 --> 04:10:02.600
The...

04:10:02.600 --> 04:10:04.600
The...

04:10:04.600 --> 04:10:06.600
The...

04:10:06.600 --> 04:10:08.600
Your...

04:10:08.600 --> 04:10:10.600
Moment here.

04:10:10.600 --> 04:10:12.700
Come in, moving.

04:10:12.700 --> 04:10:14.600
Thank you for all your help.

04:10:14.600 --> 04:10:18.600
You did so much that these wings are hardly paymented enough.

04:10:18.600 --> 04:10:20.600
But if you're happy with them.

04:10:20.600 --> 04:10:22.600
Oh, no, it was great fun building the shed.

04:10:22.600 --> 04:10:24.600
I changed the design a bit,

04:10:24.600 --> 04:10:26.100
so it's easier to take off and land.

04:10:26.100 --> 04:10:28.540
We have a problem anymore.

04:10:28.540 --> 04:10:32.340
You must remember to give yourself plenty of time though, woman.

04:10:32.340 --> 04:10:33.340
Thank you, Snork.

04:10:33.340 --> 04:10:35.060
I can't wait to try them out.

04:10:35.060 --> 04:10:36.060
I'm so excited.

04:10:36.060 --> 04:10:37.060
I don't think I'll sleep tonight.

04:10:37.060 --> 04:10:39.060
Are you trying them out tomorrow?

04:10:39.060 --> 04:10:40.580
As soon as I can.

04:10:40.580 --> 04:10:42.700
You will be careful.

04:10:42.700 --> 04:10:46.860
You must practice a lot just above the ground to get used to wearing them before you try

04:10:46.860 --> 04:10:48.180
to go too high.

04:10:48.180 --> 04:10:50.460
I don't want anything to happen to you.

04:10:50.460 --> 04:10:58.380
I'll practice, I promise.

04:10:58.380 --> 04:11:00.140
Where are you going to practice tomorrow?

04:11:00.140 --> 04:11:01.780
I haven't decided.

04:11:01.780 --> 04:11:09.580
I'll find somewhere when I come out tomorrow, perhaps on that small hill near the cliff.

04:11:09.580 --> 04:11:11.700
But that can't be too dangerous.

04:11:11.700 --> 04:11:13.700
I'll see you there.

04:11:14.700 --> 04:11:16.700
Hey!

04:11:19.700 --> 04:11:20.700
Hey!

04:11:20.700 --> 04:11:22.700
Hey!

04:11:22.700 --> 04:11:24.700
Hey!

04:11:24.700 --> 04:11:25.700
Hey!

04:11:44.700 --> 04:11:46.700
Hey!

04:12:01.700 --> 04:12:02.700
Hi, Momen.

04:12:02.700 --> 04:12:04.700
Where do you put the wings?

04:12:06.700 --> 04:12:08.700
On the table outside.

04:12:08.700 --> 04:12:12.700
You must have gone past them if you came in through the veranda door.

04:12:12.700 --> 04:12:14.700
No, I didn't.

04:12:14.700 --> 04:12:15.700
They're not there.

04:12:15.700 --> 04:12:16.700
What?

04:12:21.700 --> 04:12:23.700
Oh no, you're right.

04:12:23.700 --> 04:12:25.700
They're gone.

04:12:25.700 --> 04:12:27.700
Oh dear, I thought it was my wish.

04:12:27.700 --> 04:12:29.700
What's happened to them?

04:12:29.700 --> 04:12:30.700
Somebody stolen them.

04:12:30.700 --> 04:12:32.700
What's the matter with you, too?

04:12:32.700 --> 04:12:33.700
Is something wrong?

04:12:33.700 --> 04:12:36.700
Yes, somebody stolen Momen's wings.

04:12:36.700 --> 04:12:39.700
Well, perhaps they have them in stolen.

04:12:40.700 --> 04:12:44.700
Of course they have, and I bet I know who did it, too.

04:12:44.700 --> 04:12:45.700
Come on.

04:12:45.700 --> 04:12:46.700
Where are we going?

04:12:46.700 --> 04:12:48.700
Do you know where they are?

04:12:56.700 --> 04:12:57.700
It's stinky.

04:12:57.700 --> 04:12:58.700
Oh, yeah.

04:12:58.700 --> 04:13:00.700
Well, it certainly didn't take you long.

04:13:00.700 --> 04:13:02.700
Just a minute, stinky.

04:13:02.700 --> 04:13:04.700
Those are my wings.

04:13:04.700 --> 04:13:06.700
See, I knew it was him.

04:13:09.700 --> 04:13:11.700
You are the creature.

04:13:11.700 --> 04:13:13.700
I certainly will back.

04:13:13.700 --> 04:13:16.700
If you give them back, stinky, I'll let you try them out later.

04:13:16.700 --> 04:13:17.700
I promise.

04:13:17.700 --> 04:13:18.700
No way, boom.

04:13:18.700 --> 04:13:22.700
When they're mine now, I'm going to be a high flier.

04:13:22.700 --> 04:13:24.700
Look out, moving.

04:13:27.700 --> 04:13:28.700
Oh, stop!

04:13:28.700 --> 04:13:30.700
Oh no!

04:13:31.700 --> 04:13:33.700
You're pathetic.

04:13:33.700 --> 04:13:35.700
The wings are mine.

04:13:35.700 --> 04:13:38.700
I'll become a master criminal now.

04:13:40.700 --> 04:13:42.700
All rotten seabing.

04:13:42.700 --> 04:13:45.700
You shouldn't have left them outside, Momen.

04:13:45.700 --> 04:13:48.700
Yeah, but who'd think let each steal them?

04:13:48.700 --> 04:13:49.700
Where his friends?

04:13:49.700 --> 04:13:50.700
Well, almost.

04:13:50.700 --> 04:13:53.700
I didn't think even stinky would do something like that.

04:13:53.700 --> 04:13:54.700
Well, he did, didn't he?

04:13:54.700 --> 04:13:56.700
Now, don't worry, Momen.

04:13:56.700 --> 04:13:58.700
We'll find him and get them back.

04:13:58.700 --> 04:13:59.700
I know it.

04:14:05.700 --> 04:14:06.700
Look, Momen.

04:14:06.700 --> 04:14:08.700
Now he's going towards the sea.

04:14:10.700 --> 04:14:13.700
Oh no, turn around.

04:14:13.700 --> 04:14:15.700
But stinky didn't know how to maneuver the wings.

04:14:15.700 --> 04:14:18.700
It must take him further and further out.

04:14:21.700 --> 04:14:23.700
Turn around, we'll get turned back.

04:14:24.700 --> 04:14:25.700
Until?

04:14:33.700 --> 04:14:35.700
You're at least he's having a bath for once.

04:14:35.700 --> 04:14:37.700
The wings will be badly damaged.

04:14:38.700 --> 04:14:39.700
Never mind.

04:14:39.700 --> 04:14:41.700
Snark will build another pair.

04:14:41.700 --> 04:14:43.700
I sure hope so.

04:15:08.700 --> 04:15:13.700
They love the laughter and they love the living.

04:15:13.700 --> 04:15:16.700
The movements.

04:15:16.700 --> 04:15:24.700
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:15:24.700 --> 04:15:28.700
They're always happy and always at play.

04:15:28.700 --> 04:15:32.700
The movements are having fun day after day.

04:15:32.700 --> 04:15:35.700
The movements.

04:15:36.700 --> 04:15:40.700
The movements.

04:15:40.700 --> 04:15:43.700
They love the laughter and they love the living.

04:15:43.700 --> 04:15:47.700
The movements.

04:15:47.700 --> 04:15:54.700
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:15:54.700 --> 04:15:58.700
They're always happy and always at play.

04:15:58.700 --> 04:16:02.700
The movements are having fun day after day.

04:16:02.700 --> 04:16:05.700
The movements.

04:16:05.700 --> 04:16:09.700
The movements.

04:16:09.700 --> 04:16:15.700
The movements.

04:16:33.700 --> 04:16:37.700
Here they are for one and all.

04:16:37.700 --> 04:16:40.700
The movements are about to come.

04:16:40.700 --> 04:16:43.700
Come on and sit down here with me.

04:16:43.700 --> 04:16:45.700
Therefore you are your TV.

04:16:45.700 --> 04:16:48.700
They are the movements.

04:16:48.700 --> 04:16:51.700
They are the movements.

04:16:51.700 --> 04:16:54.700
So come with me, give me your hand.

04:16:54.700 --> 04:16:57.700
I'll take you up to a movement land.

04:16:57.700 --> 04:17:00.700
You can fly just like a bird.

04:17:01.700 --> 04:17:03.700
Sing that song ever.

04:17:03.700 --> 04:17:06.700
There were the movements.

04:17:06.700 --> 04:17:09.700
There were the movements.

04:17:09.700 --> 04:17:12.700
There were the movements.

04:17:12.700 --> 04:17:15.700
There were the movements.

04:17:15.700 --> 04:17:18.700
There were the movements.

04:17:18.700 --> 04:17:21.700
There were the movements.

04:17:30.700 --> 04:17:33.700
There were the movements.

04:17:33.700 --> 04:17:36.700
There were the movements.

04:17:36.700 --> 04:17:39.700
There were the movements.

04:17:39.700 --> 04:17:42.700
There were the movements.

04:17:42.700 --> 04:17:45.700
There were the movements.

04:17:45.700 --> 04:17:48.700
There were the movements.

04:17:48.700 --> 04:17:51.700
There were the movements.

04:17:51.700 --> 04:17:55.700
There were the movements.

04:17:56.700 --> 04:18:06.700
Captain Blood and his band of feared pirates had sailed the seas for many years,

04:18:06.700 --> 04:18:09.700
but never could he remember a storm such as this.

04:18:09.700 --> 04:18:15.700
He began to wonder whether his ship could withstand the battering and buffeting of the angry waves for much longer.

04:18:15.700 --> 04:18:21.700
Alas, it is now too late to launch the lifeboat, he thought, as he lashed himself to the wheel.

04:18:21.700 --> 04:18:24.700
His voice rose against the wind.

04:18:24.700 --> 04:18:31.700
Captain Blood can think of no better death than to journey to the bottom of the sea, losing the last battle against his old adversary.

04:18:31.700 --> 04:18:38.700
But if only I could see the life of the young and beautiful princess who I rescued from the dupe scallion before a ciker.

04:18:38.700 --> 04:18:45.700
I care not about the three chests of doubloons, two chests of jewels, and 36 bales of the richest and most colorful silks.

04:18:45.700 --> 04:18:50.700
But oh, must she too perish in this terrible storm.

04:18:51.700 --> 04:18:57.700
What a terrible storm, it's not easing at all.

04:18:57.700 --> 04:18:58.700
No.

04:18:58.700 --> 04:19:01.700
I'm so glad I'm not on my own in a night like this.

04:19:01.700 --> 04:19:04.700
I feel safe in the moment house.

04:19:04.700 --> 04:19:06.700
Oh, what was that?

04:19:06.700 --> 04:19:09.700
It sounded like a tree breaking.

04:19:09.700 --> 04:19:10.700
Hey, moment.

04:19:10.700 --> 04:19:13.700
Why don't you read your story out loud?

04:19:13.700 --> 04:19:14.700
Oh, okay.

04:19:14.700 --> 04:19:16.700
But can I start where I got to?

04:19:16.700 --> 04:19:20.700
As long as you tell us what's happened before, we won't know what it's about.

04:19:20.700 --> 04:19:22.700
And we might have missed something important.

04:19:22.700 --> 04:19:24.700
Just the main points we'll do, women.

04:19:24.700 --> 04:19:26.700
Well, there's this brave pirate.

04:19:26.700 --> 04:19:28.700
Oh, it's so much fun when someone reads out loud.

04:19:28.700 --> 04:19:30.700
Go on, moment.

04:19:30.700 --> 04:19:31.700
Captain Blood.

04:19:31.700 --> 04:19:35.700
And he and his men have captured a rich and royal gallery.

04:19:35.700 --> 04:19:39.700
They've taken lots of gold, silver, and jewels and things.

04:19:39.700 --> 04:19:41.700
And oh, yes, a princess too.

04:19:41.700 --> 04:19:43.700
It's exciting, isn't it?

04:19:43.700 --> 04:19:44.700
Yes, it is.

04:19:46.700 --> 04:19:51.700
The storm that rose that night was so violent that at first,

04:19:51.700 --> 04:19:56.700
it seemed inevitable the ship found before the waves had engulfed it.

04:19:56.700 --> 04:19:59.700
Not bad, if I say so myself.

04:19:59.700 --> 04:20:04.700
Captain Blood saw that the poor princess had indeed swooned.

04:20:04.700 --> 04:20:09.700
With only the rats for company, how frightened she must have been down in the old.

04:20:09.700 --> 04:20:15.700
The noise of the storm was deafening as the ship was thrown above under swirling sea.

04:20:16.700 --> 04:20:19.700
The captain's brave heart went out to his young and beautiful captain.

04:20:19.700 --> 04:20:20.700
Could I have some tea, Mama?

04:20:20.700 --> 04:20:21.700
Of course, dear.

04:20:21.700 --> 04:20:23.700
Would you like me to bring it up to you?

04:20:23.700 --> 04:20:25.700
No thanks. I finished for the day.

04:20:25.700 --> 04:20:28.700
That's good. Shall we all have some tea and lemonade?

04:20:28.700 --> 04:20:30.700
Yes, please. I'm very thirsty.

04:20:30.700 --> 04:20:33.700
You read very well. Thank you, women.

04:20:33.700 --> 04:20:35.700
Great story, isn't it?

04:20:35.700 --> 04:20:37.700
Could I have some strawberry juice, please, Mama?

04:20:37.700 --> 04:20:40.700
It's not, Maiden. When is your brother coming home?

04:20:40.700 --> 04:20:41.700
Oh, he didn't say exactly.

04:20:41.700 --> 04:20:44.700
But in a couple of days, I should think...

04:20:44.700 --> 04:20:49.700
It was a good idea to let snort Maiden stay while he was away, wasn't it, Papa?

04:20:49.700 --> 04:20:54.700
Yes, it wouldn't be very nice to be all on your own at night in a storm like this.

04:20:54.700 --> 04:20:56.700
Hmm, not at all.

04:21:11.700 --> 04:21:13.700
She seems to be sinking.

04:21:13.700 --> 04:21:15.700
She won't be able to hold out much longer.

04:21:15.700 --> 04:21:18.700
We must get to the crew without delay.

04:21:18.700 --> 04:21:20.700
How could we launch a boat in this weather?

04:21:20.700 --> 04:21:22.700
Any survivors?

04:21:22.700 --> 04:21:25.700
We haven't found anyone yet.

04:21:25.700 --> 04:21:28.700
So what about further along the coast?

04:21:28.700 --> 04:21:30.700
Any reports of survivors turning up?

04:21:30.700 --> 04:21:33.700
No, I'm afraid not, Inspector. We haven't heard anything.

04:21:33.700 --> 04:21:35.700
Well, tell me if you do.

04:21:35.700 --> 04:21:37.700
Ah, Inspector.

04:21:37.700 --> 04:21:38.700
Yes?

04:21:38.700 --> 04:21:40.700
It seems to me it was a pirate ship that sunk.

04:21:40.700 --> 04:21:42.700
What did you say?

04:21:44.700 --> 04:21:48.700
Well, I'm pretty sure I saw the skull and crossbones flying from the mast.

04:21:48.700 --> 04:21:51.700
And I think I caught sight of a cannon, but I could have been mistaken.

04:21:51.700 --> 04:21:53.700
You must be joking.

04:21:53.700 --> 04:21:54.700
I never joke.

04:21:54.700 --> 04:22:00.700
I can't see anything. It's too far away to make out any sort of skull and crossbones.

04:22:00.700 --> 04:22:01.700
Try this.

04:22:01.700 --> 04:22:06.700
Ah, you've got a telescope. Now why didn't you let me have this before? It might have helped.

04:22:14.700 --> 04:22:15.700
Oh!

04:22:22.700 --> 04:22:24.700
Ah, that's it. She's gone.

04:22:30.700 --> 04:22:33.700
I suppose that there aren't many pirate ships around today.

04:22:33.700 --> 04:22:38.700
Any that are afloat must be so old that they'd probably break up easily.

04:22:38.700 --> 04:22:42.700
That's if it was a pirate ship, but it sure looked like one right enough.

04:22:43.700 --> 04:22:45.700
Nothing's been washed up on the shore yet.

04:22:45.700 --> 04:22:47.700
No, not a thing.

04:22:50.700 --> 04:22:54.700
Isn't it strange that I was reading that book about pirates yesterday?

04:22:54.700 --> 04:22:57.700
They probably wouldn't be quite so romantic in real life.

04:22:57.700 --> 04:23:01.700
Well, in the book they were really great. I wish I'd been one.

04:23:01.700 --> 04:23:02.700
A pirate?

04:23:02.700 --> 04:23:04.700
Yeah, what could be more exciting?

04:23:04.700 --> 04:23:06.700
You can't mean that.

04:23:06.700 --> 04:23:12.700
Oh, yes, I do. To sail across the seven seas, the holds of your ship's crowned with treasures.

04:23:12.700 --> 04:23:16.700
But you'd have to steal the treasure from somebody first, so, Moomin.

04:23:16.700 --> 04:23:22.700
Well, yes, alright. I suppose so. But I wouldn't steal anything from anyone.

04:23:22.700 --> 04:23:26.700
Ah, then you're just a sailor. Not a pirate at all.

04:23:26.700 --> 04:23:33.700
Moomin, Mama, do you know where Moomin is?

04:23:33.700 --> 04:23:36.700
He's probably in Stuffkin's tent.

04:23:36.700 --> 04:23:37.700
Oh, yeah?

04:23:37.700 --> 04:23:40.700
Snork maiden, I have a letter for you.

04:23:40.700 --> 04:23:43.700
Yeah, you are. It's from the snork.

04:23:43.700 --> 04:23:48.700
Oh, thank you. Wait a minute, little Mai. I want to read Snork's letter.

04:23:48.700 --> 04:23:50.700
Take your time.

04:23:57.700 --> 04:24:00.700
Oh, what's the matter?

04:24:00.700 --> 04:24:02.700
It's Snork. He's coming home today.

04:24:02.700 --> 04:24:04.700
Well, that's nice.

04:24:04.700 --> 04:24:07.700
But Moomin, Mama, there's no food in the house at all.

04:24:07.700 --> 04:24:10.700
Now, don't worry about that, Snork maiden.

04:24:10.700 --> 04:24:14.700
I'll whistle up some dinner for us, and Snork can tell us all about his trip.

04:24:14.700 --> 04:24:15.700
Boom and Papa like that.

04:24:15.700 --> 04:24:19.700
Oh, thank you, Mama. Snork doesn't like missing his meals.

04:24:19.700 --> 04:24:22.700
He must have got the part sooner than he thought.

04:24:22.700 --> 04:24:24.700
Ha, that's great news.

04:24:24.700 --> 04:24:26.700
He should finish his flying ship soon, hey?

04:24:26.700 --> 04:24:28.700
I guess so.

04:24:28.700 --> 04:24:31.700
He should make it into a pirate flying ship.

04:24:31.700 --> 04:24:35.700
I could be his first maid, and no one would be able to catch us.

04:24:35.700 --> 04:24:37.700
Nobody at all!

04:24:39.700 --> 04:24:41.700
Not here.

04:24:41.700 --> 04:24:44.700
Oh, dear. I wonder where they've gone, little Mai.

04:24:44.700 --> 04:24:47.700
There's nobody here.

04:24:47.700 --> 04:24:50.700
Moomin probably wanted to go looking for an adventure.

04:24:50.700 --> 04:24:54.700
I bet they went down to the beach to see if anything's been washed out.

04:24:54.700 --> 04:24:56.700
At least the hangar's not been damaged.

04:24:56.700 --> 04:24:59.700
Let's go down to the beach. We may find a treasure chest.

04:24:59.700 --> 04:25:02.700
Huh?

04:25:05.700 --> 04:25:07.700
What is it?

04:25:07.700 --> 04:25:09.700
I just thought I heard something.

04:25:09.700 --> 04:25:11.700
Where? From in there.

04:25:11.700 --> 04:25:13.700
Hmm, weird.

04:25:13.700 --> 04:25:16.700
Oh, I know. The snork must have come back.

04:25:16.700 --> 04:25:19.700
Oh, yes. Snork. Of course.

04:25:20.700 --> 04:25:23.700
Hello, snork.

04:25:23.700 --> 04:25:26.700
Oh, snork? Are you in here?

04:25:26.700 --> 04:25:28.700
Mm-hmm.

04:25:28.700 --> 04:25:30.700
Ah!

04:25:32.700 --> 04:25:34.700
Snork me.

04:25:34.700 --> 04:25:36.700
Huh?

04:25:36.700 --> 04:25:38.700
Huh?

04:25:41.700 --> 04:25:44.700
Put her down.

04:25:45.700 --> 04:25:48.700
Oh, really? It was actually a pirate ship.

04:25:48.700 --> 04:25:53.700
It was indeed Moomin Papa, and we caught the pirates when they swam ashore.

04:25:53.700 --> 04:25:56.700
Do you think you captured all of them, Inspector?

04:25:56.700 --> 04:26:00.700
Well, of course, we don't know exactly how many there were to begin with.

04:26:00.700 --> 04:26:06.700
Hmm, right. I better barricade ourselves in Moomin House just to be on the safe side.

04:26:06.700 --> 04:26:12.700
Oh, dear. And I suppose I ought to stand guard over my greenhouse as well.

04:26:13.700 --> 04:26:18.700
Blast me, baby. So, come here, you little pineapple.

04:26:18.700 --> 04:26:22.700
Do let snork me go. You'll be sorry. You great big hairy folly.

04:26:22.700 --> 04:26:27.700
No, not in your life, though. It's just my hostage. I needed to make good my escape, but go.

04:26:27.700 --> 04:26:30.700
Then you only have yourself to blame.

04:26:30.700 --> 04:26:35.700
Hey, what? Blame? Stay where you are now. I will not be bitten again.

04:26:35.700 --> 04:26:37.700
Keep away a little cat.

04:26:37.700 --> 04:26:39.700
Well, don't hurt her then.

04:26:39.700 --> 04:26:43.700
Don't hurt her, you little shark. She's a hostage. Come me one at that.

04:26:43.700 --> 04:26:46.700
She'll be my safe passenger. These rough waters are perished.

04:26:46.700 --> 04:26:50.700
Well, then you better take me instead, because I'm much easier to carry.

04:26:50.700 --> 04:26:54.700
You, huh? Then nobody would care if I fed you slowly to the shrimps.

04:26:54.700 --> 04:26:57.700
Oh, yes, lots of people. When you overstab win, baby.

04:26:57.700 --> 04:27:02.700
All right, all right. Hold your head. We'd blow me down. No, what's your name, girl?

04:27:02.700 --> 04:27:04.700
I'm Lil Mai.

04:27:04.700 --> 04:27:08.700
Well, I'm Captain Rumpod. Not going to get whatever authorities you have in this backwater.

04:27:08.700 --> 04:27:11.700
Hurry, my patience is short.

04:27:11.700 --> 04:27:15.700
I'll only go if you promise that you won't hurt Snork Maiden.

04:27:15.700 --> 04:27:17.700
Of course I won't.

04:27:17.700 --> 04:27:21.700
If I find that you've heard her in any way at all, my revenge will be terrible.

04:27:21.700 --> 04:27:24.700
All right, all right, all right.

04:27:24.700 --> 04:27:26.700
Oh, boy.

04:27:26.700 --> 04:27:53.700
Captain Rumpod, you are surrounded.

04:27:53.700 --> 04:27:56.700
Let Snork Maiden go. Do you hear me, Captain?

04:27:56.700 --> 04:28:00.700
Do a gold button land lover like you never.

04:28:00.700 --> 04:28:04.700
She's a good-looking wench fair skinned and nicely rounded.

04:28:04.700 --> 04:28:08.700
Pirates prefer blondes. Give me a ship and you can have her back.

04:28:08.700 --> 04:28:11.700
What do you say to let my buck-hole?

04:28:11.700 --> 04:28:16.700
You're on your own, Captain. We've got all your men locked up tight.

04:28:16.700 --> 04:28:18.700
All me crew?

04:28:18.700 --> 04:28:22.700
You're the last one. Now let her go immediately.

04:28:22.700 --> 04:28:26.700
Thank you for saving me crew. I feared they were all lost.

04:28:26.700 --> 04:28:29.700
Don't thank me. They're all in jail.

04:28:29.700 --> 04:28:32.700
Ah, someone said it's the best place for them.

04:28:32.700 --> 04:28:36.700
But not me. Now let them out. I need them and a proper ship.

04:28:36.700 --> 04:28:39.700
Oh, with two masks and fifty cannon.

04:28:39.700 --> 04:28:43.700
No tricks. Else it'll be worse for the girl.

04:28:43.700 --> 04:28:46.700
This is too much.

04:28:46.700 --> 04:28:49.700
The school for constables didn't tell us about theirs.

04:28:49.700 --> 04:28:51.700
What should we do, Inspector?

04:28:52.700 --> 04:28:55.700
Please get Snorke making away from him.

04:28:55.700 --> 04:28:58.700
I'm afraid he'll hurt her and she'll be frightened.

04:28:58.700 --> 04:29:01.700
I'm trying my best, but it's very awkward all this.

04:29:01.700 --> 04:29:04.700
I've not come across anything like it before.

04:29:04.700 --> 04:29:07.700
Oh, but it's not her fault that his ship sank, Inspector.

04:29:07.700 --> 04:29:10.700
I know, I know. Oh, dear, oh dear.

04:29:10.700 --> 04:29:13.700
Oh, I should have been a gardener.

04:29:13.700 --> 04:29:16.700
Hey, are you still there, you ruffian?

04:29:16.700 --> 04:29:21.700
Let my men go and get my ship. Two masks and fifty cannon mine.

04:29:21.700 --> 04:29:25.700
Look, Captain Rumpod, I'm afraid that times have changed.

04:29:25.700 --> 04:29:28.700
Sailing ships don't have cannon these days.

04:29:28.700 --> 04:29:31.700
Shiver me timbers. How do you sink each other then?

04:29:31.700 --> 04:29:34.700
I don't try to fool me. Remember, I've got the girl.

04:29:34.700 --> 04:29:38.700
I think Moomin Papa has an old blender bus. I'm sure he'll let you have.

04:29:38.700 --> 04:29:41.700
I don't know if it'll work, though. That's all I've got.

04:29:41.700 --> 04:29:45.700
I'm one of you, pea brain. This is my final word. So listen well.

04:29:45.700 --> 04:29:48.700
You have two hours to get the ship ready to sail,

04:29:48.700 --> 04:29:52.700
and all my crew with her mine. Or else I'll...

04:29:52.700 --> 04:29:55.700
Now, don't worry, my pretty one. I won't have a single hair on your head,

04:29:55.700 --> 04:29:58.700
but I must have something to threaten them with.

04:29:58.700 --> 04:30:02.700
Or else I'll feed her to the hungry shark.

04:30:03.700 --> 04:30:06.700
Husker, I won't hurt you.

04:30:06.700 --> 04:30:07.700
Are you sure?

04:30:07.700 --> 04:30:11.700
Either I get my ship. Oak, fifty cannon, and at least two masters.

04:30:11.700 --> 04:30:13.700
Master shall be food for lobsters.

04:30:13.700 --> 04:30:15.700
it's your choice me has he

04:30:15.700 --> 04:30:18.700
that you do it.

04:30:18.700 --> 04:30:22.700
he sounds as if you'll do it too.

04:30:22.700 --> 04:30:26.700
two hours he says a real feeder to the sharks, oh dear, dear.

04:30:26.700 --> 04:30:30.700
what will snorks say, oh dear, dear.

04:30:30.700 --> 04:30:34.700
I have a great idea, sir.

04:30:34.700 --> 04:30:37.700
Why don't we climb on to the roof, drill a hole,

04:30:37.700 --> 04:30:39.700
and then drops up on his hand.

04:30:39.700 --> 04:30:42.700
No, Constable, I've always thought you were an idiot,

04:30:42.700 --> 04:30:43.700
now you've proved it.

04:30:43.700 --> 04:30:45.700
Excuse me, Inspector.

04:30:45.700 --> 04:30:49.700
If we set fire to the hangar, then they'll have to come out.

04:30:49.700 --> 04:30:53.700
Shut up! Why am I surrounded by fools?

04:30:53.700 --> 04:30:55.700
This is no good.

04:30:55.700 --> 04:30:59.700
I must calm down. I must calm down.

04:30:59.700 --> 04:31:01.700
Captain Rumbot!

04:31:01.700 --> 04:31:03.700
Can you hear me, Captain?

04:31:03.700 --> 04:31:06.700
Aha, you found a ship already, have you?

04:31:06.700 --> 04:31:10.700
Well, no, there aren't any real sailing ships in Moomin Valley.

04:31:10.700 --> 04:31:12.700
The chief Constable has a yacht.

04:31:12.700 --> 04:31:16.700
He doesn't usually let anyone borrow it, but I'm sure in this case he...

04:31:16.700 --> 04:31:19.700
I want something big enough to take me to the Spanish main!

04:31:19.700 --> 04:31:20.700
I warned you!

04:31:20.700 --> 04:31:22.700
Calm down, Captain. Calm down.

04:31:22.700 --> 04:31:24.700
Now just listen to me.

04:31:24.700 --> 04:31:26.700
You haven't done anything wrong here.

04:31:26.700 --> 04:31:28.700
No pirating or such like.

04:31:28.700 --> 04:31:31.700
So if you forget about the boat, we'll let you all go.

04:31:31.700 --> 04:31:32.700
Think about it.

04:31:32.700 --> 04:31:35.700
Three to go anywhere you like. On foot, of course.

04:31:35.700 --> 04:31:39.700
The fresh air, the sun on your face. No worry of shipwrecks.

04:31:39.700 --> 04:31:41.700
No storms at sea.

04:31:41.700 --> 04:31:43.700
What do you think we are?

04:31:43.700 --> 04:31:45.700
We're pirates, not highwaymen.

04:31:45.700 --> 04:31:48.700
It's not so bad being a highwayman, you know.

04:31:48.700 --> 04:31:51.700
There'll be lots of rich travelers on the other side of Lonely Mountain.

04:31:51.700 --> 04:31:54.700
I'm sure. And lots of adventures with jewels and gold.

04:31:54.700 --> 04:31:58.700
Day me with flagens are rubbing a chicken brain, nitwit!

04:31:58.700 --> 04:31:59.700
Nitwit?

04:31:59.700 --> 04:32:01.700
No, niggum poop! Dumbbell!

04:32:01.700 --> 04:32:03.700
I'm Captain Rumbot!

04:32:03.700 --> 04:32:05.700
You're making me very angry!

04:32:05.700 --> 04:32:07.700
If I had you on my ship, you'd dangle from the yard!

04:32:07.700 --> 04:32:09.700
I'm yet to walk the flag!

04:32:09.700 --> 04:32:11.700
The inspector's losing control.

04:32:11.700 --> 04:32:13.700
We had better calm him down.

04:32:14.700 --> 04:32:16.700
What the clank would I?

04:32:16.700 --> 04:32:19.700
And in my prison, you'd get no butter on their bread.

04:32:19.700 --> 04:32:21.700
And maggots on your biscuits!

04:32:21.700 --> 04:32:23.700
Please calm down.

04:32:23.700 --> 04:32:25.700
Is this what the pilot said?

04:32:25.700 --> 04:32:27.700
Calm down. Take the museum.

04:32:27.700 --> 04:32:29.700
Sure. We water.

04:32:29.700 --> 04:32:31.700
I'd see too that the bread was milled.

04:32:33.700 --> 04:32:35.700
That's 30 minutes gone already!

04:32:48.700 --> 04:32:50.700
I warned you, gold button.

04:32:50.700 --> 04:32:54.700
Now there is only one hour to her painful and horrible death!

04:32:55.700 --> 04:32:57.700
Oh!

04:32:59.700 --> 04:33:01.700
Cheer up, Snark Maiden!

04:33:01.700 --> 04:33:04.700
Try and hold on! We'll get you out!

04:33:04.700 --> 04:33:06.700
Water? Water?

04:33:06.700 --> 04:33:08.700
Huh? What did you say?

04:33:08.700 --> 04:33:11.700
Water, please. I'm so thirsty.

04:33:11.700 --> 04:33:12.700
Water?

04:33:12.700 --> 04:33:15.700
Mastik's stuff, still.

04:33:15.700 --> 04:33:17.700
Hey, land lovers!

04:33:17.700 --> 04:33:18.700
Compliments to the galley!

04:33:18.700 --> 04:33:20.700
The young lady wants a drink!

04:33:20.700 --> 04:33:23.700
All right, Captain. I'm coming, Snark Maiden!

04:33:24.700 --> 04:33:26.700
I'll take it, Inspector.

04:33:26.700 --> 04:33:29.700
It's too dangerous. You must leave it to us now, Momen.

04:33:29.700 --> 04:33:31.700
Just a minute, Inspector.

04:33:31.700 --> 04:33:33.700
I think we should let Momen go.

04:33:33.700 --> 04:33:35.700
And I've got an idea that just might work.

04:33:35.700 --> 04:33:37.700
Snark Maiden!

04:33:37.700 --> 04:33:39.700
It'll take an awful lot of courage.

04:33:39.700 --> 04:33:41.700
And you'll have to do it all on your own.

04:33:41.700 --> 04:33:42.700
Do you think you can do it, Momen?

04:33:42.700 --> 04:33:44.700
Of course.

04:33:48.700 --> 04:33:51.700
Splice me, babe. Raise what's taken him so long.

04:33:51.700 --> 04:33:53.700
Keep an eye on the lady. Wait.

04:33:53.700 --> 04:33:56.700
It's all right. I really don't mind waiting.

04:33:56.700 --> 04:33:59.700
Tell you the truth. I can do it and drink myself.

04:33:59.700 --> 04:34:02.700
It's thirsty work. Shouting at idiot policeman.

04:34:02.700 --> 04:34:05.700
Don't you worry, little one. They'll be here soon.

04:34:05.700 --> 04:34:09.700
Get me a drink, too. You're here and quick about it!

04:34:09.700 --> 04:34:13.700
I've brought you something to drink, Captain.

04:34:13.700 --> 04:34:17.700
All right. Come on, then. And no funny stuff.

04:34:17.700 --> 04:34:20.700
Don't worry. I'm on my own.

04:34:20.700 --> 04:34:22.700
Have you done a drink for me, too?

04:34:22.700 --> 04:34:23.700
Yes, Captain.

04:34:23.700 --> 04:34:26.700
All right. Stay there and put down the tree.

04:34:28.700 --> 04:34:30.700
The bigger one is for you, Captain.

04:34:30.700 --> 04:34:32.700
And the little one for Snark Maiden.

04:34:32.700 --> 04:34:34.700
Now move away.

04:34:35.700 --> 04:34:37.700
That's far enough. Stay there.

04:34:41.700 --> 04:34:43.700
Hmm. Why is it so red?

04:34:44.700 --> 04:34:48.700
Well, it's strawberry juice. It's very good.

04:34:52.700 --> 04:34:56.700
I'll be polite. She can drink from this one and I'll have hers.

04:34:56.700 --> 04:35:00.700
But, Captain, there's not enough for you in the small one.

04:35:00.700 --> 04:35:03.700
Strawberry juice isn't exactly my favorite tip of you.

04:35:03.700 --> 04:35:05.700
Oh, no. The small one will do.

04:35:06.700 --> 04:35:08.700
Here you are, young lady.

04:35:09.700 --> 04:35:12.700
No, no, Snark Maiden. Please, don't drink it.

04:35:13.700 --> 04:35:16.700
Why not, my young Bucco? It's not poison, is it?

04:35:16.700 --> 04:35:19.700
Don't be silly. Poisoned? Oh, no, no.

04:35:19.700 --> 04:35:21.700
Perhaps a sleeping potion.

04:35:23.700 --> 04:35:28.700
Hmm. As I thought, I deemed mighty strange the two cups were prepared.

04:35:28.700 --> 04:35:30.700
You drink it.

04:35:30.700 --> 04:35:33.700
Oh, no, no, no, sir. I'm not thirsty at all.

04:35:33.700 --> 04:35:37.700
What's the matter, Milad? You said the drink wasn't poisoned, didn't you?

04:35:37.700 --> 04:35:39.700
So drink.

04:35:39.700 --> 04:35:40.700
Movement?

04:35:40.700 --> 04:35:42.700
Ah, you're her swing, are you?

04:35:42.700 --> 04:35:45.700
I shall never understand women anyway.

04:35:45.700 --> 04:35:48.700
One of you will have to drink it and now.

04:35:49.700 --> 04:35:52.700
Not her. I'll do it. I'll do it. Give it to me.

04:35:52.700 --> 04:35:56.700
No, Movement, don't. There's something in it. You'll be poisoned.

04:35:56.700 --> 04:36:01.700
It's all right, Snark Maiden. It's nothing dangerous. Don't worry about me.

04:36:01.700 --> 04:36:03.700
I'm drinking.

04:36:06.700 --> 04:36:09.700
That's it. Drink up again.

04:36:12.700 --> 04:36:14.700
Down the hatch, Milad.

04:36:15.700 --> 04:36:19.700
You're lucky and wasn't poisoned.

04:36:19.700 --> 04:36:21.700
Yeah.

04:36:21.700 --> 04:36:24.700
And no sleeping potion, neither?

04:36:24.700 --> 04:36:28.700
No, nothing at all. Nothing at all.

04:36:31.700 --> 04:36:33.700
Oh, Movement! Oh, no, Movement!

04:36:33.700 --> 04:36:35.700
You're not my pretty one.

04:36:35.700 --> 04:36:40.700
Your wimpy little bow is just taking a nap. You'll be right as rain so...

04:36:41.700 --> 04:36:47.700
And he thought he could fool me. Me, Captain Rumpot.

04:36:47.700 --> 04:36:51.700
But she can. Well, I'll have the other one.

04:36:54.700 --> 04:36:56.700
Not bad.

04:36:56.700 --> 04:36:58.700
No, I'm sorry, young lady.

04:36:58.700 --> 04:37:00.700
They'll have to bring you another.

04:37:00.700 --> 04:37:03.700
Shall we order one without the draft?

04:37:03.700 --> 04:37:07.700
They'll be surprised when they see me still on my pins.

04:37:07.700 --> 04:37:10.700
Why do I not sleep at all?

04:37:12.700 --> 04:37:14.700
Let's go and give my surprise.

04:37:27.700 --> 04:37:29.700
A moment!

04:37:29.700 --> 04:37:32.700
It's all right. I'm okay, Snark Maiden.

04:37:32.700 --> 04:37:35.700
There's nothing in this drink. Would you like some?

04:37:35.700 --> 04:37:37.700
A moment! You mean you!

04:37:37.700 --> 04:37:40.700
Why was pretending? So I convinced you, too, huh?

04:37:40.700 --> 04:37:42.700
A moment!

04:37:48.700 --> 04:37:51.700
Captain Rumpot didn't wake up that day.

04:37:51.700 --> 04:37:56.700
Or the next. And when he did, he had a terrible headache which served him right.

04:37:56.700 --> 04:38:06.700
The inspector let all the pirates go after a week.

04:38:06.700 --> 04:38:11.700
Well, they hadn't done any pirating in Moomin Valley. And wouldn't be doing any either.

04:38:11.700 --> 04:38:14.700
Not without a ship.

04:38:15.700 --> 04:38:17.700
A moment!

04:38:23.700 --> 04:38:29.700
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

04:38:29.700 --> 04:38:37.700
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:38:38.700 --> 04:38:42.700
They're always happy and always at play.

04:38:42.700 --> 04:38:49.700
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

04:38:49.700 --> 04:38:53.700
The movements.

04:38:53.700 --> 04:39:00.700
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

04:39:00.700 --> 04:39:06.700
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:39:07.700 --> 04:39:11.700
They're always happy and always at play.

04:39:11.700 --> 04:39:18.700
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

04:39:18.700 --> 04:39:22.700
The movements.

04:39:22.700 --> 04:39:28.700
The movements.

04:39:37.700 --> 04:39:47.700
The movements.

04:39:47.700 --> 04:39:53.700
Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come.

04:39:53.700 --> 04:39:58.700
Come on and sit down here with me. They're here for you on your TV.

04:39:58.700 --> 04:40:04.700
They are the movements. They are the movements.

04:40:04.700 --> 04:40:10.700
So come with me, give me your hand. I'll take you up to Moomin Land.

04:40:10.700 --> 04:40:18.700
You can fly just like a bird. Sing that song ever. There were the movements.

04:40:18.700 --> 04:40:24.700
There were the movements. There were the movements.

04:40:24.700 --> 04:40:30.700
There were the movements. There were the movements.

04:40:30.700 --> 04:40:34.700
There were the movements.

04:41:00.700 --> 04:41:26.700
The rain was falling on Moomin Valley as though the heavens had decided to empty themselves.

04:41:26.700 --> 04:41:33.700
It was the wettest weather that anyone could remember.

04:41:57.700 --> 04:42:03.700
The rain was falling on Moomin Valley as though the heavens had decided to empty themselves.

04:42:03.700 --> 04:42:11.700
The rain was falling on Moomin Valley as though the heavens had decided to empty themselves.

04:42:11.700 --> 04:42:20.700
Mama, can I borrow this? Of course, dear.

04:42:21.700 --> 04:42:25.700
You'll miss one too? Yes, dear, but what do you need them for?

04:42:25.700 --> 04:42:28.700
It's a secret. A secret? Yeah, sure.

04:42:28.700 --> 04:42:33.700
I'll want to see a back moment, but you can keep the jar if you like. Thanks.

04:42:51.700 --> 04:42:57.700
Oh, dear. Oh, there are puddles everywhere. Oh, dear.

04:42:57.700 --> 04:43:03.700
Oh, dear. Mr. Hemmilan, what a mess. Hello, Mr. Hemmilan.

04:43:03.700 --> 04:43:12.700
Oh, good morning, Moomin. Oh, it's all misty now. What are you doing, Moomin?

04:43:12.700 --> 04:43:19.700
Observing very closely. Oh, splendid, my boy. I'm glad you find botany so excited.

04:43:19.700 --> 04:43:21.700
Hi, dear.
