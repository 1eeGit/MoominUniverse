1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,620
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with

2
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:32,620

3
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:42,620
I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there were the movements

4
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:57,620
there were the movements there were the movements there were the movements

5
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:41,620
the seeds that movement and his friends had found in a box that had been cast up on the beach

6
00:01:41,620 --> 00:02:03,620
had grown into a tropical forest it was beautiful but also dangerous with man-eating plants kept a bay by snuffkin playing as harmonica but for how long

7
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:19,620
oh dear snuffkin don't stop playing your harmonica whatever you do they'll only get angry and attack us all over again

8
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,620
if I don't stop soon I might never want to play again

9
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:35,620
well perhaps the music has made them more friendly be careful mr. himmelon oh don't worry

10
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:45,620
mr. himmelon look out

11
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:55,620
I don't think the quickly snuffkin play again

12
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,620
oh

13
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,620
oh

14
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,620
oh

15
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,620
papa we must make sure the trap door won't open again

16
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:33,620
oh yes what's this about a trap door in the kitchen they almost got him before in the tag mama we reached her just in time

17
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,620
oh

18
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:21,620
I feel sorry for them it can't be helped snuffkin if we let them out will be eaten alive

19
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,620
it makes me feel very uncomfortable having man-eating plants under the floor

20
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,620
always keep a kettle of boiling water handy in case they break through

21
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:41,620
the children are playing Tarzan they might as well seeing as they've got a jungle to play in

22
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,620
still planting those seeds might have been a terrible mistake

23
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:52,620
well mama I'm very glad that you did just think what I would have missed and movement valley suddenly being full of tropical plants

24
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,620
is wonderful I'm not fond of traveling as you know and you've brought the plants to me

25
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:06,620
the trees make it much cooler but those man-eaters who I could do without them

26
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:16,620
you're just like Tarzan Tarzan loves James

27
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,620
oh what bliss

28
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:28,620
stinky's over there stinky Tarzan teach old baddie lesson

29
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,620
oh

30
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,620
pretty stupid moment playing Tarzan without wild animals

31
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,620
animals don't come from seeds no but you need them to have a real jungle I can get you some if you want

32
00:05:52,620 --> 00:06:00,620
really I'll do anything for my friends that's very kind of you not too wild though no lions or tigers or anything

33
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:08,620
maybe it maybe chimpanzee I know exactly what you need

34
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,620
cheese bread

35
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,620
what are you doing mama well I don't like the thought of all those man-eaters still in the

36
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,620
cellar so your father and I are going to sleep in the bathhouse

37
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,620
we'll sleep outdoors too we've just built ourselves a hut

38
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,620
snorkemaiden and little Mai too well yes there's plenty of room

39
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,620
all right so that only leaves Mr. Himmelon sleeping in the house

40
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,620
and he still busy checking all the different plants

41
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:50,620

stinky said he could get some wild animals papa

44
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,620
where ever from I don't know I wouldn't trust him he'll probably put a head jog in your sleeping bag

45
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:20,620
there it is the hut oh very well built

46
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,620

47
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:04,620

48
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:10,620

49
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:32,620

57
00:09:48,620 --> 00:10:04,620

let's go hunting first ice mill humans oh be careful darling you're very out of practice

59
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:26,620

117
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:01,100
looking at the size of the jungle there must have been an awful lot of seeds in that box I suppose

118
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:08,380
the wind could have blown them anywhere where's the giant water lily let's see now

119

over there how wonderful you see I wish you learned to trust me I'm a very honest guy

120
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:39,180
it's so soft and pink and beautiful how romantic to be on a boat made from a flower this is

121
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:47,660
