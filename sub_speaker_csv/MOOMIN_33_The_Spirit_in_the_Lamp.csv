593400,596400,"I find it incredible that anyone could do such a thing.",593000,596300,"SPEAKER_01"

703400,706400,"Is that the best explanation you can think of?",702800,703000,"SPEAKER_06"
706400,709400,"No one calls Little Mai a thief and gets away with it.",704000,709200,"SPEAKER_06"
709400,712400,"Is it really true that this is your necklace, Snork Maiden?",704000,709200,"SPEAKER_06"
712400,715400,"Of course, Inspector. It was a present. I swear it.",709800,712600,"SPEAKER_00"
715400,717400,"Who gave it to you?",713000,715500,"SPEAKER_06"
717400,719400,"That's a secret between me and Moomin.",717300,719600,"SPEAKER_06"
719400,720400,"A secret?",717300,719600,"SPEAKER_06"
720400,723400,"That's a lie. They stole it, Inspector.",719600,720400,"SPEAKER_00"
723400,726400,"I've never known them to lie before, Mrs. Philly-Johnk.",721000,721000,"SPEAKER_06"

730400,731400,"No, I see it.",726300,733000,"SPEAKER_05"
731400,733400,"Stop it, Little Mai!",726300,733000,"SPEAKER_05"
733400,735400,"Bad background and you talk to them.",733000,737300,"SPEAKER_04"
735400,736400,"There you say that.",733000,737300,"SPEAKER_04"

741400,743400,"The boy has to be a pain, you know.",740700,743300,"SPEAKER_16"
751400,753400,"This is it.",740700,743300,"SPEAKER_16"
757400,759400,"I love to know who did this.",753400,753700,"SPEAKER_02"
759400,762400,"He's certainly got an act with words.",753400,753700,"SPEAKER_02"
763400,764400,"Huh?",763100,763700,"SPEAKER_15"
764400,767400,"Listen to this. This is a good example.",764100,764600,"SPEAKER_01"
767400,771400,"Hey, look at the sky. The sun's up and there's Gracie.",765100,774500,"SPEAKER_01"
771400,774400,"That's not great. Sounds very ordinary.",765100,774500,"SPEAKER_01"
774400,776400,"That's what I wrote, Snorkin.",765100,774500,"SPEAKER_01"
776400,778400,"Oh, I'm so sorry.",775100,778300,"SPEAKER_01"

782400,786400,"But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?",782300,794800,"SPEAKER_01"
786400,789400,"It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.",782300,794800,"SPEAKER_01"
789400,792400,"Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon",782300,794800,"SPEAKER_01"
792400,795400,"who is already sick and pale with grief.",790800,791000,"SPEAKER_15"
795400,797400,"What a sunrise!",790800,791000,"SPEAKER_15"
797400,802400,"And note how clever this writer is to change her name from Gracie to Juliet.",796000,801700,"SPEAKER_01"
802400,806400,"Gracie's worried because her parents don't approve of her love Edgar.",802000,812200,"SPEAKER_01"
806400,808400,"I had his names don't matter.",802000,812200,"SPEAKER_01"
808400,810400,"Tulip, I'd rangers who cares.",802000,812200,"SPEAKER_01"
810400,812400,"But listen to this.",802000,812200,"SPEAKER_01"
812400,813400,"What's in a name?",812400,817700,"SPEAKER_01"
813400,817400,"That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.",812400,817700,"SPEAKER_01"
817400,819400,"It's much more romantic.",812400,817700,"SPEAKER_01"
819400,820400,"I got it.",818000,819500,"SPEAKER_01"
820400,821400,"So Romeo would.",820400,820500,"SPEAKER_02"
821400,823400,"Well, he not Romeo called.",820900,821500,"SPEAKER_02"
823400,824400,"Oh, it's simply great.",820900,821500,"SPEAKER_02"
824400,827400,"Except maybe I wouldn't have mentioned his smell.",820900,821500,"SPEAKER_02"
827400,831400,"Don't you agree? He's an excellent playwright.",820900,821500,"SPEAKER_02"
831400,832400,"Yes, I agree.",820900,821500,"SPEAKER_02"
832400,834400,"He sounds like a very promising playwright.",831600,834700,"SPEAKER_01"
834400,837400,"And then wordy perhaps, but really good.",831600,834700,"SPEAKER_01"
837400,839400,"Very good indeed.",834900,838900,"SPEAKER_01"
839400,841400,"Write him a note asking him to carry on.",839300,841400,"SPEAKER_01"
841400,843400,"And there might not be necessary.",839300,841400,"SPEAKER_01"
843400,846400,"You know, all the changes were made in the middle of the night",842000,851600,"SPEAKER_01"
846400,847400,"while I was fast asleep.",842000,851600,"SPEAKER_01"
847400,849400,"And usually writers are in their beds,",842000,851600,"SPEAKER_01"
849400,852400,"none of their desks when they're asleep.",842000,851600,"SPEAKER_01"
852400,856400,"Well, yes, that's the only time you're not at your desk, isn't it?",842000,851600,"SPEAKER_01"
856400,859400,"But there are people you know who walk about at night",856000,856600,"SPEAKER_01"
859400,862400,"without remembering about it the next morning.",857000,863800,"SPEAKER_01"
862400,864400,"Sleepwalkers, you mean?",857000,863800,"SPEAKER_01"
864400,865400,"Now I come to think of it.",864200,868100,"SPEAKER_13"
865400,868400,"You were rather sleepy when you woke up this morning.",864200,868100,"SPEAKER_13"
868400,871400,"You're right, Mum and Mama, even sleepier than usual.",868200,872600,"SPEAKER_01"
871400,872400,"Just so.",868200,872600,"SPEAKER_01"
872400,874400,"You mean you yourself got up at night",868200,872600,"SPEAKER_01"
874400,877400,"and then went and rewrote the play and you're asleep?",872900,877500,"SPEAKER_07"
877400,879400,"Well, yes.",872900,877500,"SPEAKER_07"
879400,883400,"I have been worried about some minor things in my play.",878100,901700,"SPEAKER_01"
883400,887400,"So my subconsciousness, fairly rich and literary talent,",878100,901700,"SPEAKER_01"
887400,889400,"as we all know, comes to the rescue.",878100,901700,"SPEAKER_01"
889400,890400,"A moment, Papa.",878100,901700,"SPEAKER_01"
890400,893400,"And in my sleep, my imagination runs riot.",878100,901700,"SPEAKER_01"
893400,896400,"I have all sorts of good ideas that make me grab a pen",878100,901700,"SPEAKER_01"
896400,899400,"in the middle of the night and rush to my room",878100,901700,"SPEAKER_01"
899400,901400,"to let the real skill throw.",878100,901700,"SPEAKER_01"

1070400,1072400,"A sack of gold wouldn't be half as much fun",1063700,1073000,"SPEAKER_03"
1072400,1074400,"as a key that opens anything.",1063700,1073000,"SPEAKER_03"
1074400,1078400,"Tell me, is it possible that you rewrote women poppers play?",1073000,1079000,"SPEAKER_08"
1078400,1080400,"Yes, I did. It was really awful.",1073000,1079000,"SPEAKER_08"
1080400,1083400,"Oh, come on, now I just needed some polishing.",1079000,1092500,"SPEAKER_11"
1083400,1086400,"And what's more, see this young man standing here?",1079000,1092500,"SPEAKER_11"
1086400,1089400,"Well, he was really worried about your play, you know?",1079000,1092500,"SPEAKER_11"
1089400,1091400,"I was just trying to help.",1079000,1092500,"SPEAKER_11"
1091400,1092400,"Is this true?",1079000,1092500,"SPEAKER_11"
1092400,1095400,"Yeah, safer than mercury, of course.",1091900,1098900,"SPEAKER_03"
1095400,1098400,"But then there's professional pride to think of.",1091900,1098900,"SPEAKER_03"
1098400,1100400,"I can explain, Papa.",1091900,1098900,"SPEAKER_03"
1100400,1102400,"I saw you weren't happy about your play",1098900,1104300,"SPEAKER_07"
1102400,1104400,"and I wanted it to be a big success.",1098900,1104300,"SPEAKER_07"
1104400,1107400,"Of course, I didn't want the spirit to write it himself.",1098900,1104300,"SPEAKER_07"
1107400,1110400,"I'm going to take the key, yeah!",1105600,1108200,"SPEAKER_07"
1110400,1112400,"I've just realized, everybody,",1110300,1117900,"SPEAKER_08"
1112400,1114400,"the spirit didn't write all that himself.",1110300,1117900,"SPEAKER_08"
1114400,1115400,"I've heard it before.",1110300,1117900,"SPEAKER_08"
1115400,1117400,"I thought it sounded familiar.",1110300,1117900,"SPEAKER_08"
1117400,1119400,"Is that so?",1116500,1116500,"SPEAKER_01"
1119400,1122400,"Yes, he stole it from a play by somebody else.",1119200,1124500,"SPEAKER_08"
1122400,1125400,"This spirit is a cheat and a liar.",1119200,1124500,"SPEAKER_08"
1125400,1127400,"Oh, dear me.",1119200,1124500,"SPEAKER_08"
1127400,1129400,"Well, I can't help being so well read.",1127400,1127500,"SPEAKER_01"
1129400,1131400,"Can I go back in the lamp now?",1127500,1131100,"SPEAKER_11"
1131400,1133400,"No! Wait! Don't go yet!",1127500,1131100,"SPEAKER_11"
1133400,1135400,"I want next week's list now!",1132100,1140400,"SPEAKER_12"
1135400,1137400,"Sorry, Mastic Interblind.",1132100,1140400,"SPEAKER_12"
1137400,1139400,"Have them put into an impossible situation.",1132100,1140400,"SPEAKER_12"
1139400,1141400,"See you next week!",1132100,1140400,"SPEAKER_12"
1144400,1146400,"But that's ridiculous!",1132100,1140400,"SPEAKER_12"
1146400,1149400,"Not next week, nor next month, or even next year.",1146400,1146400,"SPEAKER_00"
1149400,1151400,"Stinky, this lamp is not yours.",1146500,1156900,"SPEAKER_00"
1151400,1154400,"Besides, I know exactly the sort of thing you'd ask for.",1146500,1156900,"SPEAKER_00"
1154400,1156400,"A master key or something.",1146500,1156900,"SPEAKER_00"
1156400,1160400,"You think you can hide that magic lamp from me, do you?",1146500,1156900,"SPEAKER_00"
1160400,1163400,"Well, there's no hiding place good enough for that.",1158400,1163800,"SPEAKER_03"
1163400,1165400,"Hmm.",1158400,1163800,"SPEAKER_03"
1165400,1170400,"Well, then I really do think that lamp is a bit too dangerous to have a rod.",1164500,1165300,"SPEAKER_01"
1170400,1172400,"Hmm. I think you're right.",1166300,1170700,"SPEAKER_01"
1172400,1175400,"Snuff candy, you have any good ideas for us?",1170800,1172700,"SPEAKER_07"
1175400,1177400,"Yes, for us.",1173300,1176200,"SPEAKER_01"
1189400,1192400,"Hmm. The week has passed, so we can summon the spirit again.",1189100,1192100,"SPEAKER_00"
1201400,1203400,"There's the inspector!",1189100,1192100,"SPEAKER_00"
1206400,1209400,"You do it, Snuffkin!",1202000,1203200,"SPEAKER_06"
1209400,1211400,"Call the spirit!",1208700,1210000,"SPEAKER_00"
1219400,1222400,"Oh, no, not again. What do you want this time?",1210400,1211200,"SPEAKER_00"
1222400,1224400,"Can you bring the hobgoblin here?",1220400,1223200,"SPEAKER_11"
1224400,1228400,"I suppose so. I'll be back as soon as I can.",1223500,1225400,"SPEAKER_11"
1236400,1239400,"But why on earth do you want the hobgoblin?",1225900,1228600,"SPEAKER_11"
1239400,1244400,"As far as I can see, there's only one safe place for the lamp where no one can find it.",1236500,1238600,"SPEAKER_07"
1244400,1249400,"And that's on another planet, and the only one who can put it there is the hobgoblin.",1240200,1244500,"SPEAKER_08"
1249400,1251400,"He's coming any minute.",1245300,1249300,"SPEAKER_08"
1251400,1253400,"Geez, that guy ever hard to find.",1251000,1259100,"SPEAKER_11"
1253400,1256400,"Thank you. I've done my wake for this week.",1251000,1259100,"SPEAKER_11"
1256400,1259400,"See you next week. Goodbye!",1251000,1259100,"SPEAKER_11"
1265400,1283400,"And some of the hobgoblin took the magic ramp away and hid it on some unknown planet.",1251000,1259100,"SPEAKER_11"
1283400,1290400,"And a good thing too, it would really be very boring if all your wishes were granted, wouldn't it?",1277800,1283200,"SPEAKER_11"
1291400,1300400,"They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.",1285600,1289800,"SPEAKER_11"
1300400,1307400,"We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.",1300300,1304200,"SPEAKER_10"
1307400,1311400,"They're always happy and goes at play.",1305100,1306200,"SPEAKER_10"
1311400,1318400,"The Moons are having fun day after day. The Moons.",1307900,1312000,"SPEAKER_10"
1318400,1322400,"The Moons.",1312000,1318000,"SPEAKER_10"
1322400,1329400,"The Moons.",1318900,1319000,"SPEAKER_10"
