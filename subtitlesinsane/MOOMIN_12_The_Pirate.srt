1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Therefore you are on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They are the movements.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So come with me, give me your hand.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll take you up to a movement land.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You can fly just like a bird.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Sing that song ever.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There were the movements.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:01:47,859
There were the movements. There was a moment, there was a moment, there was a moment, there was a moment, there was a moment Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba The bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat bat A rather blood-in-as-band of feared pirates had sailed the seas for many years, but never could he remember a storm such as this.

14
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:50,060
He began to wonder whether his ship could withstand

15
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,299
the battering and buffeting of the angry waves

16
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:53,700
for much longer.

17
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,939
Alas, it is now too late to launch the lifeboat,

18
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,739
he thought, as he lashed himself to the wheel.

19
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:02,099
His voice rose against the wind.

20
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,219
Captain Blood can think of no better death

21
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:05,900
than to journey to the bottom of the sea,

22
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:12,500
losing the last battle against his old adversary. But if only I could see the life of the young and beautiful princess

23
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,500
who I rescued from the Duke Scalian before a cycle. I care not about the three chests of doubloons,

24
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:28,039
two chests of jewels, and 36 bales of the richest and most colorful silks. But oh, must she too perish in this terrible storm?

25
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,939
Tittigood book, Mumin?

26
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:32,180
Mm, it's great.

27
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,180
What a terrible storm, it's not easing at all.

28
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,919
No.

29
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,979
I'm so glad I'm not on my own in a night like this.

30
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:43,180
I feel safe in Mumin House.

31
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,199
Oh, what was that? It sounded like a tree breaking. Hey in Mumin' House. Oh, what was that?

32
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,199
It sounded like a tree breaking.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hey, Mumin'

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,500
Hmm?

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Why don't you read your story out loud?

36
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Oh, okay.

37
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
But can I start where I got to?

38
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,800
As long as you tell us what's happened before,

39
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,099
we won't know what it's about.

40
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,099
And we might have missed something important.

41
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,000
Just the main points will do, Mumin'

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,800
Well, there's this bright part.

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh, it's so much fun when someone reads out loud.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Go on, woman!

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Captain Blood, and he and his men,

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
have captured a rich and royal gallium.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They've taken lots of gold, silver, and jewels and things.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And oh, yes, a princess, too.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's exciting, isn't it?

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes, it is.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,560
The storm that rose that night was so violent

52
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,280
that at first it seemed inevitable

53
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,199
the ship found before the waves had engulfed it.

54
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,680
Not bad if I say so myself.

55
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,759
Captain Blood saw that the poor princess had indeed swooned.

56
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,400
With only the rats for company,

57
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,560
how frightened she must have been down in the old.

58
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,199
The noise of the storm was deafening as the ship was thrown above under swirling sea.

59
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,240
The captain's brave heart went out to his young and beautiful captain.

60
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,800
Would I have some tea, Mama?

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,240
Of course, dear, would you like me to bring it up to you?

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,199
No, thanks. I've finished for the day.

63
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,000
That's good. Shall we all have some tea and lemonade?

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes, please. I'm very thirsty.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You read very well. Thank you, Moonman.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,500
Great story, isn't it?

67
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,000
Could I have some strawberry juice, please, Mama?

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,500
Snork maiden, when is your brother coming home?

69
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh, he didn't say exactly.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But in a couple of days, I should think...

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It was a good idea to let Snork maiden stay while he was away, wasn't it Papa?

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes, it wouldn't be very nice to be all on your own at night in a storm like this.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Not at all. This is the... This is the... This is the... Whoa! This is the...

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This is the...

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This is the...

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is the...

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is the...

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This is the...

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
She seems to be sinking.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
She won't be able to hold out much longer.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We must get to the crew without delay.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How could we launch a boat in this weather?

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Any survivors?

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We haven't found anyone yet.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So what about further along the coast?

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Any reports of survivors turning up?

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No, I'm afraid not inspector. We haven't heard anything.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Well, tell me if you do.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm a inspector.

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes?

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It seems to me it was a pirate ship that sunk.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What did you say?

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, I'm pretty sure I saw the skull and crossbones flying from the mast.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,160
And I think I caught sight of a cannon, but I could have been mistaken.

95
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
You must be joking.

96
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,480
I never joke.

97
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,160
I can't see anything.

98
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,959
It's too far away to make out any sort of skull and crossbones.

99
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,959
Try this.

100
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,279
Ah, you've got a telescope.

101
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,000
Now why didn't you let me have this before?

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,120
It might have helped. Oh.

103
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
Oh.

104
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Oh.

105
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Oh.

106
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Oh.

107
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Oh.

108
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
Oh.

109
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Oh.

110
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Oh.

111
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Oh.

112
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
Oh.

113
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Oh.

114
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Oh.

115
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Oh.

116
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
Oh.

117
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,879
That's it.

118
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:08,000
She's gone.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I suppose that there aren't many pirate ships around today. Any that are afloat must be so old that they'd probably break up easily.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's if it was a pirate ship, but it sure looked like one right enough.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Nothing's been washed up on the shore yet?

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No, not a thing.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Isn't it strange that I was reading that book about pirates yesterday?

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They probably wouldn't be quite so romantic in real life.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, in the book they were really great. I wish I'd been one.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
A pirate? Yeah, what could be more exciting?

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,920
You can't mean that. Oh, yes, I do.

128
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,839
To sail across the seven seas,

129
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,639
the holds of your ship's crown with treaders.

130
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,000
But you'd have to steal the treasure

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,480
from somebody first, though, movement.

132
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,360
Well, yes, all right, I suppose, though.

133
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,680
But I wouldn't steal anything from anyone.

134
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,519
Ha, then you're just a sailor.

135
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:08,000
Not a pirate at all.

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Boomin, Mama, do you know where Moomin is? He's probably in Snuffkin's tent.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Oh, yeah?

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Snork maiden.

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I have a letter for you.

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Here you are.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's from the snork.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, thank you.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Wait a minute, little my.

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,220
I want to read Snorks letter. Take your time

145
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:46,000
It's snork he's coming home today, that's nice. But, Moome and Mama, there's no food in the house at all!

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,399
Now, don't worry about that, Snork Maiden.

147
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,240
I'll rustle up some dinner for us, and Snork can tell us all about his trip.

148
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,759
Moome and Papa like that.

149
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,399
Oh, thank you, Mama.

150
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,560
Snork doesn't like missing his meals.

151
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,000
He must have got the part sooner than he thought.

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Ha!

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's great news!

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,759
Then he should finish his flying ship soon, hey?

155
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,000
I guess so. He should make he should finish his flying ship soon, hey? I guess so.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,500
He should make it into a pirate flying ship.

157
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,000
I could be his first maid and no one would be able to catch us!

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,500
Nobody at all!

159
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Ha ha ha!

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Not here.

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh dear, I wonder where they've gone, little my.

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,560
There's nobody here.

163
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:29,100
Moon probably wanted to go looking for an adventure.

164
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:32,700
I bet they went down to the beach to see if anything's been washed out.

165
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,000
At least the hangar's not been damaged.

166
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:44,000
Let's go down to the beach. We might find a treasure chest.

167
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,700
What is it?

168
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,000
I just thought I heard something.

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,399
Where? From in there.

170
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,000
Hmm, weird.

171
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh, I know. The snork must have come back.

172
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,500
Oh, yes. Snork. Of course.

173
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,200
Hello, snork.

174
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,679
Oh, snork? Are you in here?

175
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,879
Mm-hmm. Ah!

176
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,320
Snork me!

177
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,519
Put her down.

178
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, really? It was actually a pirate ship.

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It was indeed, Moomin Papa, and we caught the pirates when they swam ashore.

180
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Do you think you captured all of them, Inspector?

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, of course, we don't know exactly how many there were to begin with.

182
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:50,120
Hmm, right. We better barricade ourselves in Moomin House just to be on the safe side. Oh dear, and I suppose I ought to stand guard over my greenhouse as well.

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,440
Lace me, ma'am!

184
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,360
Come here, you little panicked!

185
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Dude, let's not make it go! You'll be sore, you great big hairy folly!

186
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,080
No, not in your life, though, ain't just my hostage!

187
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,399
I needed to make good my escape, Mago.

188
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,799
Then you only have yourself to blame.

189
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,000
Hey, what?

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Blame?

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,799
Stay where you are now.

192
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,200
I will not be bitten again.

193
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,799
Keep away a little cat.

194
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,200
Well, don't hurt her then.

195
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,399
Hurt her, you little shark.

196
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,399
She's a hostage and a cuntly one at that.

197
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,200
She'll be my safe passenger.

198
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
These rough waters are perished.

199
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,919
Well, then you better take me instead,

200
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,879
because I'm much easier to carry.

201
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,840
You, huh?

202
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,240
And nobody would care if I fed you slowly to the shrimps.

203
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,480
Oh, yes, lots of people.

204
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,120
When you overstab, win, baby.

205
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,320
All right, all right.

206
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,120
Hold your head, we'd blow me down.

207
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,080
Now, what's your name, girl?

208
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,320
I'm Lil' Myne.

209
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,919
Well, I'm Captain Rumpod.

210
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,000
Not going to get whatever authorities you have in this backwater.

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Hurry, my patience is short!

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll only go if you promise that you won't hurt Snork Maiden.

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Of course I will.

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
If I find that you've heard her in any way at all, my revenge will be terrible.

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:26,000
All right, all right, all right. Captain Rumpot, you are surrounded. Let's snork, Maiden Go. Do you hear me, Captain?

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
To a gold button land lover like you never!

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
She's a good-looking wench, fair skinned and nicely rounded!

218
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Pirates prefer blondes.

219
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Give me a ship and you can have her back.

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What do you say to that, my buck-hole?

221
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You're on your way, Captain.

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm going to get you a new pair of shoes.

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm going to get you a new pair of shoes. I'm going to get you a new pair of shoes. There's Ginden nicely rounded! Pirates prefer blondes! Give me a ship and you can have her back!

224
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What do you say to let my buck-hole?

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You're on your own, Captain!

226
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We've got all your men! Locked up tight!

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
All me crew?

228
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Ha, ha, ha! You're the last one!

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Now let her go immediately!

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Thank you for saving me crew! I feared they were all lost!

231
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't thank me, they're all in jail.

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Ha ha, someone says that best place for a banana me.

233
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Now let them out, I need them, and a proper ship.

234
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh, with two masks and fifty cannon.

235
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And no tricks else it'll be worse for the girl.

236
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is too much.

237
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The school for constables didn't tell us about this.

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What shall we do, Inspector?

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Police get snorkeling away from him.

240
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm afraid he'll hurt her and she'll be frightened.

241
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm trying my best, but it's very awkward all this.

242
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I've not come across anything like it before.

243
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,860
Oh, but it's not her fault that his ship sank Inspector?

244
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,000
I know, I know, oh dear, oh dear.

245
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,659
Oh, I should have been a gardener.

246
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:54,460
Hey, are you still there, you rough-earned?

247
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,340
Let my men go and get my ship!

248
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,799
Two masks and fifty cannon mines!

249
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:03,440
Look, Captain Rumpod, I'm afraid that times have changed.

250
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,399
Sailing ships don't have cannon these days.

251
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,600
Shiver me timbers!

252
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,200
How do you sink each other then?

253
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,559
I don't try to fool me.

254
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,759
Remember, I've got the girl!

255
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,360
I think Moomin Papa has an old blender bus I'm sure you'll let you have.

256
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,879
I don't know if it'll work though.

257
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,120
That's all I've got.

258
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,039
I'm one of you, Pee Brain.

259
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:23,720
This is my final word, so listen well.

260
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,840
You have two hours to get the ship ready to sail, and all my crew with her mind!

261
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,639
Or else I'll...

262
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,320
Now, don't worry, my pretty one. I won't harm a single hair on your head, but I must have something to threaten them with.

263
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:45,000
Or else I'll feed her to the hungry shark! Ah! Oscar, I won't hurt you. Are you sure?

264
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,500
Either I get my ship Oak 50 Cannon and at least two masters

265
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,000
she'll be food for lobsters.

266
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's your choice, mehazzy!

267
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I should do it.

268
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh!

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He sounds as if he'll do it too.

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Two hours he says the real feeder to the shark's own dear own dear.

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,480
What will Snork say? Oh dear? Oh

272
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
I have a great idea sir

273
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,440
Why don't we climb onto the roof drill a hole and then drops up on his head? You know

274
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,200
Constable I've always thought you were an idiot now you've proved it

275
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,799
Excuse me inspector if we set fire to the Hanna, then they'll have to come out, Mute.

276
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:31,799
Shut up! Why am I surrounded by fools?

277
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,299
This is no good.

278
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:37,399
I must calm down, I must calm down.

279
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,899
Captain Rumbot!

280
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:41,600
Can you hear me, Captain?

281
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Ha-ha! You found a ship already, have you?

282
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,879
Well, no. There aren't any real sailing ships in Moomin Valley.

283
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,840
The chief constable has a yacht.

284
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,720
He doesn't usually let anyone borrow it, but I'm sure in this case he...

285
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,480
I want something big enough to take me to the Spanish main! I warned you!

286
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,120
Calm down, Captain! Calm down! Now just listen to me.

287
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,200
You haven't done anything wrong here, no pirating or such like, so if you forget about the

288
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,960
boat, we'll let you all go, think about it, free to go anywhere you like, on foot of course.

289
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,240
The fresh air, the sun on your face, no worry of shipwrecks, no storms at sea.

290
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,399
What do you think we are?

291
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,120
Huh, we're pirates, not high-wamen!

292
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,519
It's not so bad being a highwayman, you know?

293
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,519
There'll be lots of rich travelers on the other side of Lonely Mountain, I'm sure,

294
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:33,279
and lots of adventures with jewels and gold.

295
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,519
Daymey with flagens are rum, you chicken brain, nitwit!

296
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,720
Nitwit?

297
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,279
No, ninkel poop, dumb bill, uncut and runpots!

298
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,080
You're making me very angry!

299
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,840
If I had you on my ship, you'd dangle from the yard!

300
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,120
I mean, what the play?

301
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,720
The inspector's losing control.

302
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,039
We had better call me down.

303
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,919
What the clank would I?

304
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:57,360
And then Mike, prison, you'd get no butter under breath

305
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,080
and nuggets on your biscuits!

306
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,080
Please calm down, Inspector.

307
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
Put the bag in the fridge.

308
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,879
All right.

309
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,000
Calm down, pick it easy.dle. Let's go. Come down, Puddle. Pick the VZ.

310
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Are you sure?

311
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Wait, water.

312
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'd see through it that the bread was milled.

313
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's 30 minutes gone already.

314
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I warned you, Goldbitten. Now there is only one hour to her painful and horrible death. Cher, up, Snark, Maiden! Try and hold on! We'll get you out!

315
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Water? Water?

316
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Huh? What did you say?

317
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Water, please. I'm so thirsty.

318
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Water?

319
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Mastik stubs too.

320
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Hey, land lovers! Compliments to the galley! The young lady wants a drink!

321
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
All right, captain. I'm coming, smart maiden.

322
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'll take it, Inspector.

323
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,299
It's too dangerous.

324
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:07,500
You must leave it to us now, Momen.

325
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,599
Just a minute, Inspector.

326
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,799
I think we should let Momen go.

327
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:14,099
And I've got an idea that just might work.

328
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,099
Snuff him!

329
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,299
It'll take an awful lot of courage,

330
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,000
and you'll have to do it all on your own.

331
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,400
Do you think you can do it, Momen?

332
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Of course.

333
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Splice me, babe, raise what's taking him so long keeping a young lady waiting.

334
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's alright. I really don't mind waiting.

335
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Tell you the truth, I could do it and drink myself.

336
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's thirsty work, shun an idiot policeman.

337
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Don't you worry, little one. They'll be here soon.

338
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Get me a drink too, you hearin' quick about it!

339
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I've brought you something to drink, Captain.

340
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Alright, come on then. And no funny stuff.

341
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Don't worry, I'm on my own.

342
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Have you done a drink for me, too?

343
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yes, Captain.

344
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,920
Alright, stay there and put down the train.

345
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,599
The bigger one is for you, Captain, and the little one for Snarkmaid.

346
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,079
Now move away.

347
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:17,039
And fire it up, stay there.

348
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,039
Hmm.

349
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:22,200
Why is it so red?

350
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,000
Well, it's strawberry juice. It's very good.

351
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Hmm.

352
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll be polite. She can drink from this one and I'll have hers.

353
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But Captain, there's not enough for you in the small one.

354
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Strawberry juice isn't exactly my favorite tip of your know. No, the small one will do.

355
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,359
Here you are young lady

356
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:50,299
No, no snorkemaiden, please don't drink it

357
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:54,000
Why not my young buckle. It's not poison, is it?

358
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,559
Don't be silly poison. Oh no, no

359
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:00,059
Perhaps a sleeping potion

360
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,000
As I thought I deemed mighty strange the two cups were prepared.

361
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You drink it.

362
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh no, no, no sir. I'm not thirsty at all.

363
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What's the matter, Milad?

364
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You said the drink wasn't poisoned, didn't you?

365
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So drink.

366
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Move it!

367
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Ah, you're her swane, are you?

368
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I shall never understand women anyway.

369
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
One of you will have to drink it and now!

370
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Not her, all who it all do it! Give it to me!

371
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
No, Mum and Don't! There's something in it! You'll be poisoned!

372
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's all right, Snorkmaten. It's nothing dangerous. Don't worry about me.

373
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'll drink it!

374
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That's it! Drink up again!

375
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Down the hatch, Melad!

376
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
You're lucky and wasn't poisoned!

377
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Yeah.

378
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And no sleeping potion, neither?

379
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:27,000
No, nothing at all. Nothing at all. And he thought he could fool me, me Captain Rumpa, but she could.

380
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Well, I'll have the other one.

381
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Not bad.

382
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
No, I'm sorry, young lady. They'll have to bring you another.

383
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Shall we order one without the draft?

384
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
They'll be surprised when they see me still on my pins.

385
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,559
Why do I not sleep at all?

386
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,559
Ha ha ha! Let's go and give my surprise, uh?

387
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,559
Oh!

388
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,559
Oh!

389
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,559
Oh!

390
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,559
Oh!

391
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,559
Oh!

392
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,559
Oh!

393
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,000
Oh! Oh! Oh, wee!

394
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
A moment! It's all right. I'm okay, Snorkemaiden.

395
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
There's nothing in this drink. Would you like some?

396
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
A moment! You mean you!

397
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I was pretending. So I convinced you too, huh?

398
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
A moment!

399
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:42,200
Captain Rumpot didn't wake up that day, for the next, and when he did he had a terrible headache which served him right.

400
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,000
The inspector let all the pirates go after a week.

401
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Well, they hadn't done any pirating in Moomin Valley,

402
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and wouldn't be doing any either, not without a ship.

403
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
They love the laughter, and they love the living the movements

404
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements

405
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
They're always happy and always at play

406
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements

407
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The movements

408
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements

409
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Believing and sharing and caring and giving the movements

410
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
They're always happy and goes at play

411
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The moments I've been fun day after day, the movements

412
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The movements, the movements The Moons
