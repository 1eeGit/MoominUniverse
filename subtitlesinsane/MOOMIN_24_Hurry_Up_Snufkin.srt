00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come. Come on and sit down here with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:28,000 --> 00:01:58,200
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la The It's spring again in Mumen Valley, and after their long winter hibernation, everyone

3
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:08,319
is awake and enjoying the sunshine of the flowers. Everyone that is except for Mumin was in bed with a terrible cold.

4
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,319
Ha, ha, ha.

5
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:24,719
Oh, dear, Mumin, that's a nasty cough.

6
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,000
My throat is very sore.

7
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,479
This will help soothe it.

8
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,319
It's one of grandma's best potions.

9
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,719
Yeah, it's hard.

10
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,719
Never mind.

11
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,520
Nice tasting medicines don't always work as well.

12
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,639
I wanted to go out, it's spring.

13
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,379
I know dear, but you'd catch pneumonia or something.

14
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:50,379
Oh, Mama.

15
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,379
Mm-hmm.

16
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,719
Does anyone know why Snuffkin hasn't come back yet?

17
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,719
No.

18
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,560
Perhaps Spring came earlier this year and he wasn't ready.

19
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,000
Snuffkin had always come back to Moonomin Valley on the very first day of spring.

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But not this year.

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Snuffkin.

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,379
I'm Moomin Papa. Is Moomin any better? No, I I'm afraid not he's still got a nasty

23
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:31,039
car I go up and see him no you'd better not you might catch it

24
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:39,680
Papa's right sniffing you know how poorly you get when you're ill it's best not

25
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,419
to take the risk I should think he'll be up and about before very long. Yes, it's better to be safe than sorry.

26
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:49,199
Moments shouldn't have gone out in the winter, should he, Mama?

27
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,560
No, but he couldn't go back to sleep.

28
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,219
Snow would have that effect on anyone.

29
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:59,360
I knew little Mai was out in the cold with him, and look at her.

30
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,199
She seems healthy enough.

31
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll take these flowers to moon later.. Little mice too small to catch a cold.

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is boring! I can't believe that movement sick.

33
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And Snuffkin's not back either.

34
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I sure wonder what's happened to him.

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I bet you moment gets better as soon as Snuffkin arrives in moment valley.

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm not going to be able to do that.

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm not going to be able to do that.

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm not going to be able to do that.

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm not going to be able to do that. I sure wonder what's happened to him.

40
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I bet you, Momen gets better as soon as Snuffkin arrives in Momen Valley.

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He's never been this late coming back before.

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Perhaps he's got fed up with you guys.

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Impossible. He's very fond of me.

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He's told me so lots of times.

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He likes Momen too, of course.

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He might have been captured by a highwayman.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's go and look for him.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The highwayman?

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
First napkin, silly.

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He's got to come back so a moment will get better.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We must find him.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But where do we look, Snork Maiden?

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In the south.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's a big place. He could be anywhere.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well, I don't care how big it is. I'm going anyway.

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're being silly.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No, I'm not. I don't think your brother will like it'm going anyway. You're being silly. No, I'm not.

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't think your brother will like it.

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
In fact, I know he won't.

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Have you gone completely bananas?

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No, I haven't.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And you'll just have to make your own muffins.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
There's more to food than muffins.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I was speaking figuratively.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Anyway, I'm going to your brother

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and nothing you can do or say will stop me.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,199
It's for Mumin.

68
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,800
That's a sort of hair-brain scheme that could only have been dreamed up by you.

69
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,399
What good will it do? You don't even know where he is.

70
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,399
It is not. Mumin is pining for Snuffkin.

71
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,600
Rubbish. Men don't pine for their friends.

72
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,000
If he isn't back yet, then he isn't coming.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And if he isn't going to come, what's the point of looking for him?

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,160
You won't find him anyway.

75
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,800
He will come when he knows that Moon is sick.

76
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,600
Black males just like a sister.

77
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,879
Something done for love could never be black male.

78
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:58,040
Oh no, you're not going and that's fine.

79
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,839
Look, why don't you and little Mai go by yourselves?

80
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,399
Oh, well I didn't really make a definite decision.

81
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,399
I just sort of said that I might come along.

82
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,480
But if Snort Maiden isn't going, then there

83
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,720
doesn't seem any point, does there?

84
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,360
And I'm not going because I think it's stupid and hair

85
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,120
brain, too.

86
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,720
Snuff can come back soon.

87
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,959
Not Snort Maiden.

88
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,959
What do you say to that?

89
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,959
Oh.

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:46,000
How is Momen feeling any better? He's asleep now, but the cough doesn't seem so bad. And his temperature? Still quite high. Hmm. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. Snark in! Snark in! Snark in!

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Snark in!

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Snark in!

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Snark in!

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Snark in!

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Snark in!

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Am I pleased to see you, Moonman?

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You look like you needed a lift.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This magic cloud must be one of those we got from the Hobgoblins top hat.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's right. I had one of them away.

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What a good idea, Moomin. You are clever.

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, it was so much fun the last time, wasn't it?

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Hi, Moomin! Hi!

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, look, Snuffkin. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm not going to do it.

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm not going to do it.

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm not going to do it.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm not going to do it.

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm not going to do it.

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm not going to do it.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm not going to do it.

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm not going to do it.

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm not going to do it.

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. Oh. Not just a dream.

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Snuff can.

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh.

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You look blousy, moment.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, thanks, stinky. You'd better keep away.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
There's no need bugs and things like that. Stay away from me.

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
They're probably frightened of someone so healthy.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,240
Mama isn't letting anyone in here.

131
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,079
It's very dull.

132
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,439
You followed a bed or something?

133
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,600
Yes, I did.

134
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,279
I know.

135
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,080
You were dreaming, weren't you?

136
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,320
Unfortunately, yes.

137
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,279
I know how you feel.

138
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,279
I have that dream a lot.

139
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,879
Oh.

140
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:43,039
You stand on a windowsill getting ready to break the glass

141
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,000
and inside there's diamonds.

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And then moment you fall.

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's not the same dream at all, stinky.

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Snuffkin hasn't come back yet.

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Have you heard anything from him? It's very late.

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Ah, Snuffkin, um.

147
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Huh, you know something, don't you?

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
All I know is that he went away as usual last autumn and hasn't come back yet.

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And then...

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yes, what?

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,200
Snark Maiden wanted to go looking for him

152
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,399
because she thinks that if Snork Kid comes back

153
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,500
he won't be sick anymore, but Snork with a letter.

154
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Snork Maiden?

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,399
He snorked Maiden way!

156
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,399
Snork me!

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You're not serious, are you? I feel perfectly alright. You look like that's warmed up if you ask me. Thanks a lot.

158
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Now Stinky, tell me which way does Snuff can normally travel south?

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Hey, are you going looking for him?

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes, it's not really spring in Moomin Valley if he's not around.

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's just not right somehow.

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay, you're all as mad as each other.

163
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But you'll help me?

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,440
I'll help you. Yes, it's not really spring in Moomin Valley if he's not around. It's just not right somehow.

165
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,039
Okay, you're all as mad as each other.

166
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,980
But you'll help me. I've got to try and find him, Stinky.

167
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:55,019
Yes, all right, but don't tell your parents I helped you.

168
00:09:55,179 --> 00:10:08,000
Don't worry, I'm fine. Here's your lunch, movement. How are you feeling?

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Movement?

170
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Papa, come here quickly.

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hmm.

172
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh, sorry, stinky. Are you okay?

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh, I'm fine.

174
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Here's your lunch, movement. How are you feeling?

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Movement? Papa, Mummenn. How are you feeling? Mummenn?

176
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Papa, come here quickly!

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Mmm.

178
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh, Papa, Mummenn's gone. He's not in his bed.

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Not in his bed? Are you sure, Mama?

180
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Of course I am. His room is empty and there's no sign of him.

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Perhaps he's in one of the other rooms. Don't worry mama, I'll find him.

182
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You're home, Mumin! Mumin!

183
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Hi, you're Mumin, Papa!

184
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, little Mai!

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What's wrong? You look worried!

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
A moment's gone off somewhere.

187
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I expect you must have gone to look for Snaftkin.

188
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Snaftkin?

189
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, you know how crazy Moomin is about him.

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Bits stupid if you ask me.

191
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But he's not well. He's got a fever. I'm sure this is the right way?

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Of course I'm sure I live in this forest, don't I?

193
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why don't we miss each other somewhere?

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Well if you think you might, don't go there and it's up to you.

195
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But I've got to...

196
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Moments!

197
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, snort me, little.

198
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Huh?

199
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Huh?

200
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Where are you taking him, Stinky?

201
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You can see he's not well.

202
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm not taking him. He insisted on going. I came to look after him.

203
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Is that really right, Boomin?

204
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes, I wanted to find Snuffkin, so he'd come back.

205
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Well, I was going to find him for you. Little mine's sniff were coming too, but they chickened out so I came on my own.

206
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What did Snork say about that? I bet he wasn't happy.

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh, he made a big fuss and I just let him.

208
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So you just walked out and came on your own?

209
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Brothers, always think they can tell you what to do.

210
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I just ignore him.

211
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Did you tell your parents where you were?

212
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Ah, no.

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Did you put him up to this stinky? It's just a sort of thing you do.

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No, I did not.

215
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's true, Snork Maiden.

216
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know how you did it stinky, but I know you and I know you're to blame and I don't think I won't find out.

217
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's not fair, Snark Maiden. It was nothing to do with me at all.

218
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Oh, he's right, Snark Maiden. He didn't want to show me the way, but I made him.

219
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm taking you home.

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, but Snark Maiden. Look.

221
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No, buts. You're sick and you should be in bed and your parents must be very worried.

222
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Look!

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Moving!

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's Papa, it isn't that snorke behind him.

225
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes it is.

226
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh, it's time I wasn't here.

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm glad you hadn't gone too far, Moomer. I might never have found you.

228
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm very sorry, Papa.

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I have a feeling you're behind this stinky come on quickly out with it.

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,600
Why doesn't anyone believe me it was moments I'd be I swear it was.

231
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,600
It was Papa I wanted to find snuffkin.

232
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,899
Are you alright moment?

233
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,899
Snork me.

234
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:42,899
Here we go again.

235
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,639
Snork me what are you doing here I thought I told you not to go on this silly jump.

236
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,080
Well, I didn't say I wouldn't.

237
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,679
Did I?

238
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,799
Listen to me, Snark.

239
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,360
Oh, you're looking guilty, stinky.

240
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,440
How did you persuade her to disobey me?

241
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,960
See, I told you.

242
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,840
You stay nice and warm in bed,

243
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,000
and I'll mix them of grandma's potion with honey for you.

244
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You'll have to be better soon because I have a feeling Snuffkin's on his way.

245
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
My wish Snuffkin would hurry up then we could all get back to normal at last.

246
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
My sentiment's exactly.

247
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,039
So where is snuffkin well he's on his way back to woman valley but he's had a

248
00:14:31,039 --> 00:15:18,000
very long walk and is getting very tired now Poor Snuffkin. He's had a terrible cold as well. This feeling rather weak. Hello, I know you don't I?

249
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:35,279
Oh yes, your snuffkin!

250
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Isn't that water still a little cold for that? You'd better come by the fire and keep warm or you'll catch cold. This is nice!

251
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Just think I'll be the one that's set by Snuffkin's fire.

252
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And he told me to keep warm and that catch cold. Just Nick, I'll be the one that's that by Snuffkin's fire.

253
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And he told me to keep warm and not catch cold.

254
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Hmm, that's no big thing, little fella.

255
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's a pretty chilly night out here.

256
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, it is.

257
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I've heard so many stories about you from everybody.

258
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And each year I try to watch you go past, but I've never been brave enough to talk to you before.

259
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Stories from everybody.

260
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,120
I don't know if I like that.

261
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,200
In fact, I'm sure I don't.

262
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,440
What's your name, little fella?

263
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,080
Oh, well, I haven't got one.

264
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,519
I'm so small that nobody's ever asked me before.

265
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,559
I've always wanted to have a name, you know?

266
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,240
And it was you who asked me.

267
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,159
And I've actually met you and sat next to it.

268
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,360
You're countifying.

269
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,639
Oh, it's so wonderful.

270
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,120
You don't know how happy it makes me meeting you like this.

271
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,799
Aw, come on. You do go on a bit old fella. You just get warm now.

272
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,120
Do you think Snuffkin? Oh, I don't know whether I should ask you. I don't want to offend you.

273
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,879
Oh, well, why not? Yes, I will.

274
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,759
Perhaps you'd be kind enough to it. I mean, would it be too much trouble for you to think of a name for me?

275
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
There. I've said it be too much trouble for you to think of a name for me? There. I've said it now.

276
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Well choosing a name is important. I'd have to think carefully about that.

277
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But it will be easy for you. You know everything!

278
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Now listen to me. You can't look up to people too much if you want to be yourself. It's not right.

279
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But Snuffkin, you're so clever. You can do anything, anything at all. I know you can.

280
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I've always wanted to be free like you to do whatever I feel.

281
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, I'm sorry I'm talking too much. I want to listen to you too. All about your travels for a start.

282
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I know you're on your way to the Moon Valley to see all your friends. The hedgehog told me the Moon

283
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
stayed out for most of the winter. Just waiting for you to come back.

284
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,359
Now, isn't that wonderful?

285
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,359
What?

286
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,240
I'd love to have someone that missed me so much

287
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,279
they were miserable until I came back.

288
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,759
You don't know how lucky you are that you're so special.

289
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,599
Well, perhaps I'm not going there.

290
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,839
I might have somewhere else to visit instead.

291
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh, moment will be very sad if you don't go back.

292
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yes, but you've got to have time to be on your own as well.

293
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Of course you have, and I've taken up too much of yours now.

294
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Wait, I think I'll be off.

295
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Okay, thanks.

296
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Goodbye, Snuffkin. Good night, little fella. Hey, wait a minute. What about your name?

297
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You remember it!

298
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Well, what do you think of TD Wu, my friend?

299
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yes, TD Wu.

300
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm not sure if you remember it.

301
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm not sure if you remember it.

302
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm not sure if you remember it.

303
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm not sure if you remember it.

304
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm not sure if you remember it. I'm not sure if you remember it. What about your name? You remembered! Well, what do you think of TDW, my friend?

305
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yes, TDW.

306
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's nice and happy to start with, and then a little sadness.

307
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
TDW.

308
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's right. TDW.

309
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
TDW.

310
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
TDW.

311
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:27,839
TDW! TD-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo!

T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-W anyone a name. Yeah! I think I'll build a house and then I can put up a real name plate that says

312
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:28,839
TDWOO!

313
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:32,519
Ah, good idea TDWOO. About what I said before.

314
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,519
Huh?

315
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:39,200
You know, not going back to Moomin Valley? Well I am. I've missed Moomin and all my friends.

316
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,640
Oh, I didn't take that seriously. You just got upset at something I said. I'm afraid

317
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,000
that happens a lot. I guess I talked too much.

318
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Maybe you do.

319
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll be going back to Moomin Valley a bit behind schedule, and this year's spring came along early too.

320
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But I suppose it's better late than never, as they say.

321
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Moomin will be happy. Say hello to everyone from TDW.

322
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,640
I will, and I'll tell them how it came about.

323
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,839
That's where you keep your harmonica, isn't it, Snuffkin?

324
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,599
It's really famous, you know?

325
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,519
I didn't realize that.

326
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,279
Do you know?

327
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,279
I've never ever heard any music.

328
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,279
Really?

329
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,599
What would you like me to play?

330
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,640
Anything.

331
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,720
