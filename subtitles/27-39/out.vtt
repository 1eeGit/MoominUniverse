WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Off we go then, Hank is away, he won't have to road too hard, the wind will pick us up soon.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Goodbye, have a good time, everyone.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Goodbye, Snuffkin, now don't forget to shut all the windows if it rains, will you?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
No.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Up towards!

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hey! Wait for me, I want to have a good time too!

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Hey, wait!

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Look, Snuff is still waving.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
He's a sweet boy.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Let's keep waving, Moonman, till we're out of sight.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Bye, Snuffkin! Bye, bye!

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Bye!

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
No, I'm not waving goodbye, I want to go too!

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Don't eat all the road, Mary Tabo, we're gone!

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
It's no good shouting little Mai, he can't hear you.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
He's giving us a great send-off though, for Snuff, he should have come with us.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Nancy, I'm going off and leaving me here on my own.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Snuffkin, if you wouldn't mind, I think we need some music to send us on our way.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
What do you say?

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Are you sure we're on the right course for the island, Papa?

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Yes, the winds with us and the sails are fine.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
I bet if we keep this speed up, we'll be there by tomorrow.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Well, if the wind stays like this, you could be right.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
The wind's not dying down at all.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
I'm surprised, I never thought we'd keep up this speed.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Now make sure you're allergic.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
Of course we will be, Papa, if we carry on like this, perhaps we'll see the light from the lighthouse while it's still dark.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Well, we don't want to hit anything at this speed.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Don't worry, we're watching.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Ah, this is the light.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Papa, the wind's dropped.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Well, that's strange, it shouldn't happen that quickly.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Do you want us to start rowing, Moomin, Papa?

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
No, Snuffkin, I think we'd better get some sleep.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Stupid wind, I really wanted to see the lighthouse at night.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
It's getting foggy too.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I can't even see the stars anymore.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Right, Snuffkin, wake me in two hours and I'll take over.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Okay, Moomin, Papa.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
What's the matter, Little My?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I thought I heard something.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
It's coming from over there somewhere.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Can you see anything?

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
No, but I can hear it.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
It's so good eye, and it's getting closer.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Little Moomin, Papa, get up, Moomin!

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Stop it, Little My! What's the matter with you?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
You too, Moomin, quickly, before it's too late!

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
What's the matter, Little My?

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
I can hear her ship, I can't see it, but it's very close and getting closer.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
A ship? Where?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Over there, and she's bearing down on us.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Quickly, we don't have much time.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Yes, by the boobalier right.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
We must let them know we're here, a signal.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Right, all hands on deck.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Maybe if we all shout as loud as we can.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Look!

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Oh!

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Too late for shouting!

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
It's huge!

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Look out! It's gonna hit us!

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I think Moomin's right, what can we do?

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
It's too late for anything, just brace ourselves and be ready to swim for it.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Quick, get down, Little My!

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Oh!

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I don't believe it!

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Little My!

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Huh?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
That's hard, the ship didn't hit us.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Oh yes, he did!

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
What?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
It went straight into our rudder when nothing happened!

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
It went right through us!

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Right through us, that's impossible she couldn't have.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I wonder if there was anyone on board that ship.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I can't see any lights.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
I know, Snuffkin, I think it's a ghost ship.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
A ghost ship?

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Well, there's no wash and no damage to us.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
It's the only explanation, I think she's right.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
A ghost ship, we've actually seen one.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Oh dear, oh dear, I need to sit down, all this excitement's too much.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
Papa, don't they say that if you see a ghost ship, something terrible is gonna happen to you?

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
What happened in the first place to make it become a ghost ship? That's what I wanna know.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Well, that's just some old sailor's tail, Moomin.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
If it had been a real ship, we'd probably be sinking now.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Don't you think so, Snuffkin?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah, I suppose.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
That's one way of looking at it.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Come on, cheer up you guys, at least it was fun.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
What's the matter?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Has something happened?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
What are you laughing at?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
What's so funny?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Are you going to tell us?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Why didn't you wake me up, Moomin?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Oh!

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Well, I think we're doing very well.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
We're doing very well.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
We're doing very well.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Oh!

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Well, I think we're doing very well.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Oh, what a beautiful sky, just look at it.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Oh, the fog is lifting.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Oh, what's it dozed off?

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Another beautiful day, not a ghost ship in sight.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
The lighthouse.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Hey, wake up everybody, the lighthouse.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
I can see the lighthouse we're there.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Oh, the sun shining, we must have slept for hours.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Oh, there it is.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
This is ridiculous.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
We've been next to it all night.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
We could have gone and slept there.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I can't wait to go ashore.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
All right, everyone, jump to it.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Man the old.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
There's something strange going on here.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
What is it, Snuffkin?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
I'm not sure.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Moomin Papa.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Our boat didn't move at all last night, did it?

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
No, it doesn't seem to have moved at all.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
So why couldn't we see the light from the lighthouse,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
even when the fog cleared?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I can't work it out.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Yes, you're right, Snuffkin, it seems very odd.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
We should have seen it.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Well, perhaps the lighthouse keeper forgot to put it on, Moomin Papa.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I don't think so, little Mai.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
You can't forget a thing like that.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
I suppose it could be broken.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
There could be lots of reasons for it.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Why don't we hurry up and get ashore,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
and then we can ask the keeper.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Look, there's someone in a boat.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Hmm.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
It looks like he's fishing.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
He know about the lighthouse.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
He probably lives on the island.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Let's get closer.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Easy now.

09:09.000 --> 09:18.000
Now, hoi there, good morning.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Any luck?

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
Not yet, but it's still early.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Hmm, yes, quite.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I'll ask him straight out.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Do you know if the lighthouse was working last night?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I don't know.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
He said, no, it wasn't.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
What did I tell you?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
He forgot to light it.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Oh, it wasn't only last night.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
You'll never see a light in that lighthouse.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Not even on stormy nights.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
We'll never.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
So what does the keeper do then?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Nothing.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
There is an lighthouse keeper.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Why?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
I'm sorry.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
I'm afraid I don't know.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
All I can say is I haven't seen one.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Do you live on the island?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Hey, mister.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
You're asking too many questions.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Who are you?

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
I'm Moment Papa from Moment Valley, and this is my family.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
We've come a long way in order to do some important work here.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
No work on this island.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
No, you better go back home.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
You see, I've come here to research an epic novel about the sea.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Just turn around and go back.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
You're too far from home.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Oh, please, wait.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Shh.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Dear, don't shout.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
We mustn't scare the fish away.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Let's go a show and have some breakfast.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I expect we're all hungry.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Bunny, pair.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
The old ones lost his marbles.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
The old ones lost his marbles.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
The old ones lost his marbles.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
The old ones lost his marbles.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
The old ones lost his marbles.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
The old ones lost his marbles.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
The old ones lost his marbles.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Look, Moment Papa. There's a path here leading to the lighthouse.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
We'll leave this stuff here and we'll go and explore it first.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Right, to the lighthouse, everyone.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Up, bow.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Come on!

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
What's wrong?

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
Why do you always get so upset when somebody mentions the lighthouse?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
It's not your call, sir.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Business boy doesn't concern you at all.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
You were like that when I asked you about it before.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
Maybe if you were to tell me, I might be able to understand.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I could try anyway.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Either talk about something else or keep quiet.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
You understand that?

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
It's so very rocky, I don't think it would work.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
What? A garden.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Hello there!

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Is there anybody at home?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
There's nobody here.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
That boy was right. It's been empty for ages, I think.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
Oh, the door was left unlocked. I know we do it, but most people don't.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Something terrible's happened.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
Something terrible! Please, little my, you know I had things like that.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Don't worry, snort maiden.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Little my, it's just trying to scare you.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I don't like hearing about anything horrible.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
Flag your ears then, snort maiden, because I haven't finished yet.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
And the next bit's really horrible.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Oh, well, where have you been finished there?

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Well, the lighthouse keeper is still up there.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
He got scurvy and hats and been able to move for months.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
And nobody's heard his cries for help.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
And with no food, he's almost a skeleton.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
If he isn't dead already, he'll be at the top of the stairs, crawling towards his fingers,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
lading and ripped up ribbons and flowers, mouth.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
God, it's endless, mouth.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Shut up, little my.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
That's enough.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
It was a good imagination though.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I'll let you use it in your book, if you like.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Come on, tell me what did she say, Moonman?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Oh, nothing, really. Nothing at all.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Tell me, Moonman, but leave out the bits I wouldn't like.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
Where are you going, Papa?

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Well, listen, everyone.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
First, I'm going to get the lamp working.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
Then we'll give the place a good clean and then we'll move in.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
We'll be the new lighthouse keepers.

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
And once again, the seas around this island will be safe for ships to navigate in troubled water.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Come on, Papa!

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Careful, careful.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Touch anything, that's dangerous.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Oh!

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Will Moonman Papa be able to get the light working again?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Where is the lighthouse keeper?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
And what could have made him go without locking the door,

14:21.000 --> 14:27.000
leaving the ships in peril and the seas with no one to guide them away from the rocks?

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
And who is the mysterious fisherman?

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the moments.

14:41.000 --> 14:49.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
They're always happy and always at play.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
The movements.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
The movements.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

15:11.000 --> 15:19.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
They're always happy and always at play.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
The movements.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
The movements.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
The movements.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Here they are for one and all.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
The movements are about to come.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
They're here for you on your TV.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
They are the movements.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
They are the movements.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
So come with me.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Give me your hand.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I'll take you up to a movement land.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
You can fly just like a bird.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Sing that song ever.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
They're with the movements.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
They're with the movements.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.000
They're with the movements.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
They're with the movements.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
They're with the movements.

16:59.000 --> 17:26.840
The movements came to this island to visit a real lighthouse, but when they got there,

17:26.840 --> 17:34.840
I found it was completely deserted, no light, and no lighthouse keeper.

17:34.840 --> 17:43.840
Woman Papa is going to try and mend the lamp, and the others are all helping to clean up.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.840
This is it, then. Do you think it's broken, Papa?

17:46.840 --> 17:55.840
Well, I'm not sure. I've not had a great deal of experience with this sort of thing.

17:55.840 --> 18:00.840
Look over there, woman. It's the boy and the fisherman from the boat.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.840
They're a bit strange, aren't they?

18:02.840 --> 18:05.840
They must live somewhere here on the island.

18:05.840 --> 18:10.840
Hmm, let's see. Let's see.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.840
Oh, my God.

18:15.840 --> 18:28.840
Oh, thank you. Leave it by the door when you haven't quite finished yet.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.840
Well, at least we can see the floor now.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.840
I think the keeper must be lying dead under the dust.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.840
Nobody's cleaned here for a long time, that's for sure.

18:38.840 --> 18:42.840
That probably means the lighthouse lamp hasn't been working for ages either.

18:43.840 --> 18:46.840
I wonder if Papa will be able to fix it.

18:46.840 --> 18:52.840
I wonder if they're going to manage to get the light working all right.

18:52.840 --> 19:00.840
Well, the lighthouse without a lamp is pretty sad, isn't it?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.840
Come on, light, will you?

19:02.840 --> 19:08.840
Right, I'll give you one last chance.

19:08.840 --> 19:13.840
Then I'm getting the big spanner. Now, you don't know me, but I don't give in easily, especially to machines.

19:13.840 --> 19:22.840
Have you thought, brass brain, what will happen tonight if there's a storm and there's a ship out there looking for land or trying to keep off the rocks and there's no light to guide them?

19:22.840 --> 19:24.840
You'll be sorry, Dan, but it'll be too late.

19:24.840 --> 19:28.840
And all I can say is that if the light hasn't been working for some time,

19:28.840 --> 19:31.840
then I'm afraid that there could have been many shipwrecks.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.840
Oh, that's awful.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.840
It would be dangerous to come too close to the island without a light to help you.

19:37.840 --> 19:41.840
I wouldn't be surprised if that ghost ship went one of them.

19:41.840 --> 19:47.840
It all seems very strange, and I wonder what made the lighthouse keeper leave in such a hurry.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.840
Unspeakable horror, please be quiet, little my.

19:50.840 --> 19:51.840
It's obvious.

19:51.840 --> 19:55.840
Close thrown above dishes left unwashed, jigsaw puzzles have finished.

19:55.840 --> 19:59.840
It's an unsolved mystery of the sea, just like the Marie Celeste.

19:59.840 --> 20:03.840
And if you don't understand that, then you're being even stupider.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.840
Then usual.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.840
Oh dear poor man, I wonder what he was like.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.840
He must have been very lonely here on his own.

20:12.840 --> 20:16.840
He scribbled messages over the walls like no side of a ship.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.840
It's Christmas, another month gone.

20:18.840 --> 20:24.840
I must clean the lamp, and I need to talk to someone.

20:24.840 --> 20:29.840
Oh, well, if he didn't see many ships, at least they could have been many shipwrecks either.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.840
Oh, I hope not Papa.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.840
That would be one good thing anyway.

20:33.840 --> 20:38.840
Perhaps the sea came and took him on a dark and stormy night, and he was swept out, and no one saw him go.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.840
That's rubbish, little my.

20:40.840 --> 20:45.840
On dark and stormy nights, lighthouse keeper sits safe by a fire drinking hot tea laced with rum.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.840
He might have run out of rum and gone to get more.

20:48.840 --> 20:51.840
Well, I don't think anything terrible happened to him.

20:51.840 --> 20:55.840
He just got more and more lonely and fed up, and then went off and got a girlfriend.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.840
Be careful, snuffkin.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.840
It's very rough and not even, and you don't want to fall into the sea.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.840
I certainly don't.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.840
Now, watch your step. The rocks are very slippery.

21:05.840 --> 21:08.840
Are you alright?

21:08.840 --> 21:12.840
Yes, Lang, so I didn't think they'd be a slippery as all that.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.840
What's the matter?

21:14.840 --> 21:17.840
Look over there. There's something moving, but I can't see what it is.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.840
It's probably a boat.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.840
No, that's what I call a real ship.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.840
It's not a real one.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.840
What do you mean?

21:26.840 --> 21:29.840
It's the ghost ship, the one we saw last night.

21:29.840 --> 21:34.840
You're right. Why isn't it come back snuffkin? What does it want?

21:34.840 --> 21:39.840
I don't know. Perhaps it followed us to the island and for some reason wants to make contact.

21:39.840 --> 21:49.840
Let's go home snuffkin. I don't like this.

22:10.840 --> 22:14.840
What's up?

22:14.840 --> 22:18.840
I'm having a great dream and you can be with me.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.840
Oh, it was horrible. Someone stepped on my face.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.840
Well, none of us sleep.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.840
We were all asleep. What are you doing?

22:25.840 --> 22:27.840
It's very odd.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.840
No, somebody's on my stomach now.

22:33.840 --> 22:36.840
Don't be stupid.

22:36.840 --> 22:41.840
Oh, I have a look snuffkin. There must be something there. Please snuffkin, please.

22:41.840 --> 22:44.840
I can't see any.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.840
What's that?

22:46.840 --> 22:47.840
What is it?

22:47.840 --> 22:51.840
I don't know yet, movement. I think I can see a pair of feet.

22:51.840 --> 22:52.840
A pair of feet.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.840
No legs, just feet.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.840
But that means a ghost.

22:56.840 --> 22:59.840
Oh, help! Get it off me! Go away, go away!

22:59.840 --> 23:05.840
Let me at them! Where are they? I'll teach them to spoil my dream!

23:05.840 --> 23:08.840
They're on my face now. Go away, will you?

23:08.840 --> 23:10.840
Show me it, but no, stamp on it!

23:10.840 --> 23:11.840
Stop it, move!

23:11.840 --> 23:13.840
No, it's my foot!

23:29.840 --> 23:31.840
You go fishing again today?

23:31.840 --> 23:32.840
No, I'm not.

23:32.840 --> 23:36.840
Oh, do you need me or is it alright if I go and see those people?

23:36.840 --> 23:37.840
In the lighthouse.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.840
Oh, don't let you want.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.840
Okay, goodbye then.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.840
You mean this room is really haunted?

23:49.840 --> 23:51.840
It certainly is.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.840
But we only saw a pair of feet.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.840
I'll sleep here tonight. Don't worry. I'll protect you.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.840
Are you going to scare it away, Papa?

23:59.840 --> 24:01.840
Mm-hmm.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.840
I can't find any good shells.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.840
You're me.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.840
What about this one?

24:13.840 --> 24:15.840
Oh, yes, that's lovely.

24:17.840 --> 24:20.840
Go on, take it. I don't collect them.

24:23.840 --> 24:24.840
Who are you?

24:24.840 --> 24:26.840
Well, I'm a ghost, sort of.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.840
Are you the rat who walked over us last night?

24:28.840 --> 24:30.840
You were lucky I didn't grab you.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.840
Sorry, it wasn't just me.

24:32.840 --> 24:33.840
There were a few of us.

24:33.840 --> 24:34.840
And walk over each other.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.840
Can I give you a present?

24:36.840 --> 24:38.840
You can't get around me that easily.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.840
You better show yourselves or you'll be sorry.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.840
It's just me.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.840
The others have all left me and gone off with the ship.

24:44.840 --> 24:47.840
Ha, so why didn't you go with them?

24:47.840 --> 24:50.840
Oh, I wanted to, but uh, well...

24:50.840 --> 24:52.840
Come on, out with it.

24:52.840 --> 24:58.840
Never got me and left me all of my own and I was frightened.

24:58.840 --> 25:02.840
Well, I can see why they wouldn't want a drippy thing like you around.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.840
You call yourself a ghost.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.840
No, I'm sorry.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.840
I just can't work out what's wrong with it.

25:10.840 --> 25:13.840
Let's try and see what happens here.

25:13.840 --> 25:18.840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, heavens, oh, my.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.840
Oh, good.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.840
Oh, no, oh, what?

25:29.840 --> 25:31.840
Oh, you were right, papa.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.840
Oh, thank goodness you're here, quick.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.840
Open all the windows, I'm chocky.

25:36.840 --> 25:43.840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

25:50.840 --> 26:00.840
Mmm, this is great. That soup I've had for ages, Moome and Mama.

26:00.840 --> 26:01.840
Would you like some more?

26:01.840 --> 26:08.840
Oh, he has, please. Can I have the recipe? I could make some for the fisherman. I know he'd love it.

26:08.840 --> 26:11.840
I'll write it out for you. What's his name?

26:11.840 --> 26:17.840
I don't know. He doesn't say. I've come from the north. I left about three months ago.

26:17.840 --> 26:23.840
Although it seems a lot longer, and I'd been rowing south in my small boat, trying to reach Moome and Valley.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.840
Oh, really? We live there.

26:25.840 --> 26:30.840
Do you? You're lucky. It must be very nice. I've never been there, but I've heard that it's beautiful.

26:30.840 --> 26:38.840
Anyway, there was a violent storm in my little boat capsized. He rescued me, and I've stayed with him in his cabin ever since.

26:38.840 --> 26:42.840
And he doesn't talk about himself at all. That's very strange.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.840
No, but I think he does have a big secret.

26:46.840 --> 26:47.840
How do you know, Toft?

26:47.840 --> 26:52.840
Well, sometimes he just stares and stares at the lighthouse in any sort of size.

26:52.840 --> 26:53.840
I wonder why.

26:53.840 --> 26:57.840
I did ask him once, but he glared at me in such a nasty way.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.840
I haven't dared say a word about it since.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.840
You don't want to stay with him then?

27:01.840 --> 27:10.840
Oh, yes. Well, most of the time he's really nice to me, and since I've been here, I've sort of taken care of him, because you see he doesn't really look after himself.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.840
Can I have a cup of tea, please, Mama?

27:14.840 --> 27:17.840
Yes, dear. How is the light coming along?

27:17.840 --> 27:20.840
Oh, not very well. There's still a few more things I could try, though.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.840
Hello. You were on that boat fishing, weren't you?

27:23.840 --> 27:26.840
Yes, I was. My name is Toft, Mum and Papa.

27:26.840 --> 27:32.840
Oh, please, to meet you. Is your friend here as well? I wanted to ask him something. There's something ever quite important.

27:32.840 --> 27:33.840
Ask him what?

27:33.840 --> 27:36.840
Well, about this lighthouse for one thing.

27:36.840 --> 27:39.840
Well, he won't talk about that. He just refuses to.

27:39.840 --> 27:44.840
Oh, dear, does he? The thing is, I'm trying to light this beacon, but having no success.

27:44.840 --> 27:49.840
I wondered whether he might know if there's an easy way of doing it. You never know. I haven't missed something.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.840
It's very quiet.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.840
He might be out fishing, you know.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.840
Come on, let's go.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.840
Where are you going, Moomin?

27:58.840 --> 28:00.840
I want to ask that man some questions.

28:00.840 --> 28:03.840
He doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who does a lot of talking.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.840
Do you think he might know something about the lighthouse keeper?

28:06.840 --> 28:08.840
That's what I want to find out.

28:10.840 --> 28:20.840
Hello, my name is Moomin, and this is my friend Snuffkin.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.840
What's your business here?

28:23.840 --> 28:29.840
I wonder, do you live here? I suppose you must have met the lighthouse keeper, have you?

28:29.840 --> 28:31.840
I didn't want people to talk about that.

28:31.840 --> 28:35.840
We were just curious about why you left the lighthouse. Do you know why?

28:35.840 --> 28:38.840
No, he kept himself to himself.

28:38.840 --> 28:43.840
Oh, so you do know it. When did he leave? Where did he go? You must know.

28:43.840 --> 28:44.840
Get.

28:44.840 --> 28:48.840
Oh, please. Had the light stopped working before he left?

28:48.840 --> 28:52.840
Why did he leave the door open? Were there any shipwrecks?

28:52.840 --> 28:55.840
Oh! Wait a minute. Just one more question, please.

28:55.840 --> 28:59.840
Oh, don't go. There's something very important I need to know.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.840
You're the only other person on the island apart from the go ship.

29:02.840 --> 29:06.840
Oh, please come back. Look, my father is trying to get the lamp working again,

29:06.840 --> 29:10.840
but not getting anywhere. So if you know where the keeper is, or better still,

29:10.840 --> 29:14.840
how to light it when you please help, it's not only for us, but for all those ships

29:14.840 --> 29:18.840
that might be in danger without it.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.840
Moomin.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.840
I don't think that man knows much about anything.

29:25.840 --> 29:29.840
Well, at least he's heard you and knows what you want.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.840
Let's go, Moomin.

29:37.840 --> 29:42.840
Look, over there, what's Moomin Papa doing?

29:42.840 --> 29:46.840
Snork made an a little Maya helping him.

29:46.840 --> 29:48.840
Hiya!

29:48.840 --> 29:50.840
Come on.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.840
Yeah.

29:52.840 --> 29:56.840
It's about time. Where are you two being?

29:56.840 --> 30:00.840
What are you building now? We're making a raft. Why?

30:00.840 --> 30:04.840
Because we wanted to stupid, why else would we build it? Do you like it?

30:04.840 --> 30:06.840
But why do you want a raft?

30:06.840 --> 30:09.840
It's not really a raft, is it Papa?

30:09.840 --> 30:12.840
Let me present our very own hand-built ghost ship.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.840
A ghost ship?

30:14.840 --> 30:18.840
He must be here somewhere.

30:18.840 --> 30:22.840
Well, if he's the one that walked on me last night, I want a word with him.

30:22.840 --> 30:26.840
Yeah, sorry. I'm afraid that was me.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.840
I want a word with him.

30:28.840 --> 30:31.840
Yeah, sorry. I'm afraid that was me and my friends.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.840
Oh, where are you?

30:33.840 --> 30:36.840
Show us a bit of leg at least. I like to see you I'm talking to.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.840
Yes, all right.

30:39.840 --> 30:43.840
Oh, well, at least he looks like a ghost.

30:43.840 --> 30:44.840
Thank you.

30:44.840 --> 30:47.840
Ghosts look pretty silly when the sun's shining if you ask me.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.840
Well, it was your idea.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.840
I always thought ghosts were frightening.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.840
Yes, we forgot our chains last night.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.840
It's very hard to be ghostly without them.

30:55.840 --> 30:57.840
We did our best to scare you, though.

30:57.840 --> 31:00.840
The ghost came to this island because a lighthouse was a bit like an ancient castle.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.840
We feel more at home in castle.

31:02.840 --> 31:05.840
And now when they found us here, they changed their minds and gave up.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.840
That's funny, isn't it?

31:07.840 --> 31:09.840
What's the matter?

31:09.840 --> 31:11.840
You look a bit fed up.

31:11.840 --> 31:14.840
That's because he's been left behind by the other ghosts.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.840
They've gone off in the ghost ship.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.840
Wow, they didn't tell me they were going straight away.

31:19.840 --> 31:22.840
And I'd gone to the lighthouse keepers cabin.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.840
The lighthouse keeper?

31:24.840 --> 31:25.840
Why did you go there?

31:25.840 --> 31:28.840
Well, I wanted to tell him that some strange people.

31:28.840 --> 31:29.840
I'm sorry.

31:29.840 --> 31:33.840
I mean, strangers had moved into the lighthouse and that he'd be better off with us

31:33.840 --> 31:35.840
because ghosts don't damage things.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.840
I didn't know you then, of course.

31:37.840 --> 31:38.840
But some people are very kind.

31:38.840 --> 31:39.840
Where is his cabin?

31:39.840 --> 31:41.840
Is it easy to find?

31:41.840 --> 31:43.840
At the southern end of the island.

31:43.840 --> 31:46.840
But it was a waste of time because he wouldn't talk to me.

31:46.840 --> 31:47.840
I shouldn't have bothered.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.840
And then I would have caught the boat.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.840
Anyway, he's not going back to his job, so that's that.

31:53.840 --> 31:54.840
Bye-bye.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.840
Thanks again for the raft.

31:56.840 --> 31:57.840
Take care.

31:57.840 --> 32:00.840
I hope you catch up with your friends real soon.

32:00.840 --> 32:01.840
Thank you.

32:01.840 --> 32:02.840
You're okay for mortals.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.840
I promise next time we meet Abbey Rally's scurry.

32:05.840 --> 32:06.840
Chains and all.

32:06.840 --> 32:09.840
Lots of chains and we promise to be terrified.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.840
You can come and scare me anytime you want.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.840
Bye-bye.

32:14.840 --> 32:15.840
Relating a try.

32:15.840 --> 32:16.840
Bye-bye.

32:16.840 --> 32:17.840
Bye-bye.

32:17.840 --> 32:21.840
He said anything that could float would do.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.840
But that raft seemed a bit flimsy to me.

32:24.840 --> 32:25.840
I wouldn't like to chance it.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.840
It can be rough out there.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.840
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

32:29.840 --> 32:30.840
Those can't drown.

32:30.840 --> 32:31.840
Can they?

32:31.840 --> 32:32.840
They're dead already.

32:39.840 --> 32:40.840
Mama.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.840
What is it, Mum and Dia?

32:42.840 --> 32:44.840
Papa's gone fishing again.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.840
Well, he enjoys it.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.840
Well, that's all he seems to do these days.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.840
He's not working on the lamp at all.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.840
Well, perhaps living in a new place makes him want to do a new thing.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.840
And he does catch one now and again.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.840
What are you making, little boy?

33:05.840 --> 33:06.840
An elevator.

33:06.840 --> 33:08.840
An elevator?

33:08.840 --> 33:11.840
Yes, and when that's finished, I'm going to build a house.

33:11.840 --> 33:12.840
Oh, my goodness.

33:12.840 --> 33:14.840
A house of my very own.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.840
Mum and Papa doesn't seem his usual happy self,

33:22.840 --> 33:25.840
even though he enjoys his fishing.

33:25.840 --> 33:28.840
He's upset that he couldn't make the lamp work

33:28.840 --> 33:30.840
and isn't used to failure,

33:30.840 --> 33:33.840
but nothing he tries makes any difference.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.840
What a pity it would be to leave the island

33:35.840 --> 33:38.840
without seeing the beautiful beams shining over the water.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.840
MUSIC

34:10.840 --> 34:11.840
Yeah, hey!

34:11.840 --> 34:13.840
Come and have a look, everyone!

34:13.840 --> 34:14.840
I finished my house.

34:14.840 --> 34:15.840
Huh?

34:16.840 --> 34:17.840
Hey, Mum and Papa!

34:17.840 --> 34:19.840
Come here, the fisherman's coming!

34:20.840 --> 34:21.840
Wow, the fisherman!

34:24.840 --> 34:25.840
Yes, and the boy is with them!

34:25.840 --> 34:27.840
He's off to his outside?

34:34.840 --> 34:36.840
You don't want to do it, do you?

34:36.840 --> 34:38.840
No, but I gotta do it.

34:40.840 --> 34:41.840
Right!

34:48.840 --> 34:50.840
Here you are.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.840
So, what can we do for you?

35:04.840 --> 35:05.840
Oh!

35:08.840 --> 35:11.840
Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you!

35:12.840 --> 35:13.840
Hmm?

35:13.840 --> 35:18.840
Tough just told us it's your birthday today, so all the best wishes from us.

35:18.840 --> 35:21.840
My birthday? Is it really?

35:21.840 --> 35:24.840
Excuse me for asking, but how old are you?

35:24.840 --> 35:26.840
I just don't remember.

35:26.840 --> 35:30.840
It doesn't matter. I'm sorry we don't have any presents.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.840
I haven't had coffee for many, many years.

35:37.840 --> 35:40.840
Bring the barrel, woman mama.

35:40.840 --> 35:41.840
Yes, dear.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.840
Now, let me see. I found this...

35:44.840 --> 35:45.840
...sawester.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.840
I wonder if it suits me. What do you think?

35:49.840 --> 35:50.840
Well...

35:50.840 --> 35:53.840
I suppose this must belong to the lighthouse keeper.

35:56.840 --> 35:58.840
Why don't you try it on?

35:58.840 --> 36:01.840
You look good in a sowester. There it suits you.

36:01.840 --> 36:08.840
We'd love to know why you left the island and why you didn't come back here.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.840
And also why you didn't like the land.

36:11.840 --> 36:15.840
We really would like to know if you feel you could tell us.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.840
I was so lonely.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.840
For years and years.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.840
Then I just went away.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.840
I'm afraid that's all.

36:28.840 --> 36:32.840
But you did come back. Surely that must mean something.

36:32.840 --> 36:37.840
I knew I'd lived here for too long. Much too long.

36:37.840 --> 36:40.840
You see, I didn't really fit in anywhere else.

36:46.840 --> 36:51.840
This is the lighthouse keeper's uniform, isn't it? Why don't you put it on again?

36:51.840 --> 36:55.840
And look, it's nice here. I'd like to stay. Would you mind that?

36:55.840 --> 36:57.840
I'll stay if you let me.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.840
Ah, I'd love that.

36:59.840 --> 37:03.840
It'd be fun to see you looking like a lighthouse keeper.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.840
Oh, hooray!

37:25.840 --> 37:29.840
Three days later, the Moomans left the island.

37:29.840 --> 37:37.840
They decided to leave at night with the safe blow of the lighthouse beans guiding their path out and away to Mooman Valley.

37:37.840 --> 37:45.840
Mooman Papa had quite forgotten about his epic novel of the sea, but couldn't wait to start again on his memoirs.

37:46.840 --> 37:50.840
The Moomans

37:51.840 --> 37:58.840
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomans

37:58.840 --> 38:05.840
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomans

38:06.840 --> 38:16.840
They're always happy and always at play. The Moomans are having fun day after day. The Moomans

38:16.840 --> 38:20.840
The Moomans

38:20.840 --> 38:27.840
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomans

38:27.840 --> 38:34.840
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomans

38:35.840 --> 38:45.840
They're always happy and always at play. The Moomans are having fun day after day. The Moomans

38:45.840 --> 38:49.840
The Moomans

38:49.840 --> 38:55.840
The Moomans

39:04.840 --> 39:29.840
Here they are for one and all. The Moomans are about to call. Come on and sit down here with me. They're for you on your TV. They are the Moomans

39:29.840 --> 39:32.840
They are the Moomans

39:32.840 --> 39:35.840
So come with me, give me your hand

39:35.840 --> 39:38.840
I'll take you up to a moment land

39:38.840 --> 39:41.840
You can fly just like a bird

39:41.840 --> 39:46.840
Sing that song ever, there were the Moomans

39:46.840 --> 39:49.840
There were the Moomans

39:49.840 --> 39:52.840
There were the Moomans

39:52.840 --> 39:55.840
There were the Moomans

39:55.840 --> 39:58.840
There were the Moomans

39:58.840 --> 40:01.840
There were the Moomans

40:07.840 --> 40:10.840
Mom

40:13.840 --> 40:15.840
Everything's so boring

40:15.840 --> 40:16.840
Let's do something then

40:16.840 --> 40:22.840
Like what, for instance, I think we've done everything one could possibly do

40:22.840 --> 40:26.840
None of you three can think of a single thing to do. You're useless, aren't you?

40:26.840 --> 40:30.840
Well, can you think of anything except catching grasshoppers?

40:30.840 --> 40:33.840
There must be something we can do

40:33.840 --> 40:40.840
Now we've all had times like this, haven't we? Fortunately, right then, the mailman arrived

40:40.840 --> 40:43.840
Hello, a letter for you

40:43.840 --> 40:47.840
Oh, a letter that must be from my sister for me

40:47.840 --> 40:50.840
Oh no, it's from a woman Papa this time

40:50.840 --> 40:55.840
That's all? Who would write to him? A woman? Someone called Jane?

40:55.840 --> 40:56.840
Huh?

40:56.840 --> 40:58.840
See that he gets it now

40:58.840 --> 41:00.840
Who could this Jane possibly be?

41:00.840 --> 41:03.840
It's your father's old girlfriend, of course

41:03.840 --> 41:04.840
Never

41:04.840 --> 41:06.840
Oh, I'm sure he had dozens and dozens

41:06.840 --> 41:09.840
Moom and Papa was very kind and handsome young man

41:09.840 --> 41:11.840
A voice from the past

41:11.840 --> 41:14.840
Moom and Papa, liquid, I've got for you

41:15.840 --> 41:16.840
Hmm

41:18.840 --> 41:20.840
Oh, no

41:20.840 --> 41:21.840
I was right

41:21.840 --> 41:22.840
Yeah, you were

41:24.840 --> 41:27.840
Moom and Mama, I think you should go back to the kitchen

41:27.840 --> 41:29.840
Whatever, for a little lie

41:29.840 --> 41:32.840
Because Moom and Papa store me youth is catching up with him

41:32.840 --> 41:35.840
Please, Papa, tell us it's not that kind of letter

41:35.840 --> 41:38.840
Oh, what would you do?

41:39.840 --> 41:40.840
Don't worry

41:40.840 --> 41:45.840
Whatever it was, it was a long time ago, long before I ever met you

41:45.840 --> 41:48.840
No, it's not that kind of letter

41:48.840 --> 41:50.840
What sort of letter is it then?

41:50.840 --> 41:53.840
Oh, much worse, it's from Aunt Jane

41:53.840 --> 41:54.840
Who's that?

41:54.840 --> 41:57.840
Mine, my dear, is on my father's side

41:57.840 --> 41:59.840
Oh, how boring

41:59.840 --> 42:02.840
You look very pale suddenly, dear

42:02.840 --> 42:05.840
Yes, because she's coming for a visit tomorrow

42:05.840 --> 42:10.840
Oh, don't worry, there's plenty of time for arranging a welcome party

42:10.840 --> 42:14.840
But I don't like her, and I don't want her to come for a visit

42:14.840 --> 42:16.840
Moom and Papa, why not?

42:16.840 --> 42:18.840
Well, you'll soon see, she's very rich

42:18.840 --> 42:20.840
Very rich

42:20.840 --> 42:24.840
Yes, and she bosses everyone, and we won't have a moment of peace

42:24.840 --> 42:28.840
Oh, maybe she's so rich, she'll give us all wonderful presents

42:28.840 --> 42:33.840
Goodness, this is so unexpected, why is she coming here all of a sudden?

42:33.840 --> 42:38.840
Oh, she says she wants to discuss money matters, good heavens with me

42:38.840 --> 42:41.840
She says there's no one else, so you see, I'm in a very difficult situation

42:41.840 --> 42:44.840
Oh, why can't you tell if you're not an expert?

42:44.840 --> 42:48.840
You don't tell Aunt Jane things, she tells you when that's that

42:48.840 --> 42:50.840
Is that what you explained?

42:50.840 --> 42:52.840
When you meet her, you'll know exactly what I mean

42:52.840 --> 42:55.840
What do I know about money matters?

42:55.840 --> 42:56.840
Nothing

42:56.840 --> 42:58.840
Not surprising since we've never had any

42:58.840 --> 43:02.840
How can she expect a poor creature like you to know anything about money?

43:02.840 --> 43:05.840
Also, she's very, very suspicious

43:05.840 --> 43:08.840
And she says money is a terrible burden

43:08.840 --> 43:11.840
Oh, I wouldn't mind shouldering her burden

43:11.840 --> 43:14.840
Maybe you'll inherit it, and then we could share the money

43:14.840 --> 43:17.840
And have a wonderful time together

43:18.840 --> 43:40.840
This time, I almost did it

43:40.840 --> 44:10.840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

44:10.840 --> 44:39.840
I'm sure she jumped at it. Hmm, there'd be no harm in asking, I guess. What's the matter, Mr.

44:39.840 --> 44:45.840
Hamilton, you look so unhappy. I'm stuck, that's my problem. How's that?

44:46.840 --> 44:56.840
Stuck in my research, this magnifying glass is very good, of course, but I just can't get any further with my botanical research with this old fashioned equipment.

44:57.840 --> 45:06.840
What I really need is a microscope and a laboratory. Hmm, and they're expensive, I guess. Yes, they are, and I don't have any money.

45:06.840 --> 45:13.840
Well, moment Papa's aunt is coming over tomorrow, and I know she's got any amount of money. Any amount, Sniff?

45:14.840 --> 45:24.840
I'll get her to finance you, Hamilton, and we'll get a big greenhouse, and you'll grow orchids and roses and other things, and then we'll sell them, oh, oh, I'll get rich. You too!

45:36.840 --> 46:04.840
Hey, you over there. Hmm, are you talking to me? Of course I am. Who else? I say do you know the way to move in a house young man? Yes, she might say I do. Show me where it is then.

46:05.840 --> 46:13.840
Over there, it's tall and blue, just follow that stream and you can't miss it. Good, would you be kind enough to take my suitcase?

46:14.840 --> 46:19.840
I'm sorry I can't, I'm too busy. I'll reward you handsomely for your efforts, think again young man.

46:20.840 --> 46:24.840
But all I want to do is fish. What? You don't want money?

46:25.840 --> 46:31.840
I heard you were coming to visit moment Papa, you're a Jane, aren't you?

46:31.840 --> 46:37.840
Oh, well, please to meet you, I'm here to take you to moment house. Is this your suitcase?

46:40.840 --> 46:43.840
Wow, this suitcase is very heavy.

46:43.840 --> 46:46.840
Should be, it's full of golden coins.

46:47.840 --> 46:53.840
Oh, I'll take care of this. Let's go and take.

47:02.840 --> 47:09.840
I can't stay in this house, I don't think I can take Aunt Jane. I'm going to hide out in the cave until she's gone.

47:10.840 --> 47:22.840
Bye bye, then dear. Careful now Aunt Jane. The banks have been slippery here and there.

47:29.840 --> 47:33.840
A roundhouse, how stupid, typical of my nephew.

47:33.840 --> 47:36.840
Welcome to moment house Aunt Jane.

47:36.840 --> 47:38.840
Welcome Aunt Jane.

47:38.840 --> 47:41.840
I'd like you to meet us up in a minute.

47:41.840 --> 47:43.840
Please to meet you.

47:45.840 --> 47:47.840
She's very small for a daughter.

47:47.840 --> 47:51.840
Oh little Mai isn't ours, she just lives here.

47:51.840 --> 47:53.840
And I won't get any bigger, either.

47:53.840 --> 47:56.840
Hmm, she's like a member of the family.

47:56.840 --> 48:00.840
And where's my worthless nephew? Why isn't he here?

48:00.840 --> 48:04.840
Oh, well, he's not, is he not at home?

48:05.840 --> 48:08.840
Well, no, when will he be back? I don't know.

48:08.840 --> 48:12.840
He's away looking for inspiration for his work, so he won't be back for a while.

48:12.840 --> 48:15.840
Since when has he worked? I'm here to see him.

48:15.840 --> 48:17.840
Maybe you can see me instead.

48:17.840 --> 48:21.840
What a splendid idea, how clever of you, moment.

48:21.840 --> 48:23.840
Ridiculous, he knows nothing about money.

48:23.840 --> 48:30.840
In that case, it is high time he learned. As for his father, I may still disinherit him.

48:31.840 --> 48:35.840
I'm a member of his family, too. I could talk to you about money matters.

48:35.840 --> 48:36.840
Really?

48:36.840 --> 48:39.840
Oh, sniff is a great friend of mine.

48:39.840 --> 48:41.840
Hmm.

48:41.840 --> 48:45.840
But hardly a member of the family.

48:45.840 --> 48:49.840
Hello, moment. And you must be on Jane.

48:49.840 --> 48:54.840
I brought my brother to snort with me. He wanted to meet you.

48:54.840 --> 48:57.840
This is Aunt Jane, the nice dog.

48:58.840 --> 49:00.840
Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane.

49:00.840 --> 49:05.840
This is my lovely sister, snort maiden, who is Moomin's special friend.

49:05.840 --> 49:08.840
The snorts and the Moomin's may one day be related.

49:08.840 --> 49:11.840
So in a way, we're all really family.

49:11.840 --> 49:14.840
You maybe, but not to me.

49:14.840 --> 49:19.840
I'm an inventor, and due to an accident, I'm looking around for a sponsor.

49:19.840 --> 49:23.840
A golden opportunity for anyone with some loose capital.

49:23.840 --> 49:26.840
Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane.

49:26.840 --> 49:29.840
I'm Hemmielin, a botanist of note.

49:29.840 --> 49:33.840
I heard that you might be willing to fund my scientific research, Aunt Jane.

49:33.840 --> 49:37.840
A golden opportunity for anyone with some spare money, eh?

49:37.840 --> 49:39.840
You'd like me to fund your research?

49:39.840 --> 49:41.840
It was my idea.

49:41.840 --> 49:46.840
If we built a greenhouse and grow rare orchids and roses, we can make a lot of money.

49:46.840 --> 49:48.840
And you'll make a lot of money.

49:48.840 --> 49:50.840
Young man, I have a lot of money already.

49:50.840 --> 49:53.840
Oh, hasn't sniff discussed this with you, Mom?

49:53.840 --> 49:54.840
Yes, sniff.

49:54.840 --> 49:56.840
Well, I was just getting around to it, Hemmielin.

49:56.840 --> 49:57.840
Confusing?

49:57.840 --> 50:01.840
When I am famous for my botanical research, Aunt Jane, I...

50:01.840 --> 50:03.840
I don't know that will ever happen.

50:03.840 --> 50:05.840
This is very confusing indeed for me.

50:05.840 --> 50:08.840
Now, you're snorkemaid and a friend of Moomin, is that right?

50:08.840 --> 50:10.840
Oh, no, I'm the snorric snort maiden's brother.

50:10.840 --> 50:12.840
I'm a friend of Moomin, Aunt Jane.

50:12.840 --> 50:15.840
Did you really explain about my important research, Sniff?

50:15.840 --> 50:18.840
Did you really explain that I'm a member of the family?

50:18.840 --> 50:20.840
Hey, she got it!

50:20.840 --> 50:24.840
So, Aunt Jane would be grateful to all of you and make you a member of the family.

50:24.840 --> 50:26.840
Thank you, Aunt Jane.

50:38.840 --> 50:40.840
Here's your rule, Aunt Jane.

50:40.840 --> 50:44.840
Oh, I do hope you'll be comfortable here.

50:44.840 --> 50:46.840
Just call if you need anything.

50:51.840 --> 50:53.840
Oh...

50:53.840 --> 50:55.840
Come out.

51:00.840 --> 51:02.840
Here's your suitcase.

51:02.840 --> 51:03.840
It was very heavy.

51:03.840 --> 51:04.840
Thank you.

51:07.840 --> 51:09.840
Hemm...

51:09.840 --> 51:10.840
What is it?

51:10.840 --> 51:11.840
You want a reward?

51:11.840 --> 51:13.840
No, no, Aunt Jane.

51:13.840 --> 51:17.840
I mean, yes, I do, but...

51:18.840 --> 51:19.840
Uh...

51:19.840 --> 51:20.840
Which is it?

51:20.840 --> 51:22.840
Will you make up your mind, young man?

51:22.840 --> 51:25.840
I know where Moomin Papa is right now.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.840
He's a whale and a trip, I know.

51:27.840 --> 51:29.840
No, no. He's somewhere quite near.

51:29.840 --> 51:31.840
Quite near here?

51:31.840 --> 51:32.840
Well, where is he?

51:32.840 --> 51:35.840
Moomin Papa said not to tell you where he's hiding.

51:35.840 --> 51:36.840
It's a secret.

51:36.840 --> 51:37.840
A secret?

51:37.840 --> 51:38.840
Yes.

51:38.840 --> 51:41.840
I suppose I could tell you, but he'll be very angry.

51:41.840 --> 51:43.840
Where is he? Tell me now.

51:43.840 --> 51:46.840
Well, if I tell you I'm taking a big risk...

51:46.840 --> 51:47.840
Hmm.

51:47.840 --> 51:48.840
Oh, very well.

51:48.840 --> 51:50.840
How much do you want?

51:50.840 --> 51:52.840
I'll leave that to you.

52:14.840 --> 52:16.840
Thank you for the information.

52:16.840 --> 52:18.840
Now you shall have your reward.

52:18.840 --> 52:20.840
Hold out your hand.

52:20.840 --> 52:23.840
Oh, is that all?

52:23.840 --> 52:27.840
Until I've seen him for myself with my own eyes.

52:27.840 --> 52:28.840
Yes!

52:34.840 --> 52:35.840
Huh?

52:35.840 --> 52:36.840
What?

52:36.840 --> 52:39.840
Oh, there's nobody here.

52:39.840 --> 52:41.840
Where is my worthless nephew?

52:41.840 --> 52:44.840
Hey, this is very strange.

52:44.840 --> 52:47.840
You tricked me, haven't you?

52:47.840 --> 52:50.840
Well, no, I swear I would never do that.

52:50.840 --> 52:53.840
You certainly deserve no reward.

52:53.840 --> 52:54.840
Huh?

52:54.840 --> 52:55.840
But no, wait.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.840
If we just look around, we'll find him.

52:57.840 --> 52:59.840
He's in here somewhere I know it.

52:59.840 --> 53:02.840
Hey, Moomin Papa, I got rid of her.

53:07.840 --> 53:09.840
Moomin, Mama.

53:09.840 --> 53:11.840
Yes, Aunt Jane, what is it?

53:11.840 --> 53:14.840
Tell me where my nephew is hiding.

53:14.840 --> 53:16.840
Well, as I said before...

53:16.840 --> 53:18.840
I want to know the truth.

53:18.840 --> 53:19.840
Dear, he's...

53:19.840 --> 53:21.840
Now let me see...

53:21.840 --> 53:22.840
Come on, hurry up.

53:22.840 --> 53:25.840
He's hiding in the cave down by the beach.

53:25.840 --> 53:29.840
I've just been there, Moomin Mama, and I can't find him.

53:29.840 --> 53:32.840
Then he really must have gone away on a trip.

53:32.840 --> 53:35.840
And why should he want to hide from me anyway?

53:35.840 --> 53:38.840
I think he might be a little bit afraid of you.

53:38.840 --> 53:39.840
Afraid of me?

53:39.840 --> 53:41.840
Afraid of his own aunt?

53:41.840 --> 53:43.840
But why?

53:43.840 --> 53:45.840
Mostly he's afraid of money matters.

53:45.840 --> 53:46.840
Incredible.

53:46.840 --> 53:49.840
Afraid of me because of money matters?

53:49.840 --> 53:52.840
He must be utterly mad.

53:52.840 --> 53:54.840
What a family.

53:54.840 --> 53:56.840
I don't understand.

53:56.840 --> 54:02.840
It seems that only Smith knows anything about money.

54:02.840 --> 54:05.840
I know where Moomin Papa is right now.

54:05.840 --> 54:08.840
So you want some of my gold, who do you young lady?

54:08.840 --> 54:11.840
I couldn't care less about your silly gold.

54:11.840 --> 54:13.840
My silly gold indeed.

54:13.840 --> 54:17.840
With silly gold, I assure you you can do just anything you want.

54:17.840 --> 54:22.840
Seems to me your silly gold doesn't even help you to find Moomin Papa.

54:22.840 --> 54:23.840
Hmm?

54:23.840 --> 54:25.840
I think you should forget about your money.

54:25.840 --> 54:29.840
Young lady, money isn't something you can just forget about.

54:29.840 --> 54:31.840
It needs constant looking after.

54:31.840 --> 54:34.840
That's why I must talk to Moomin Papa at once.

54:34.840 --> 54:37.840
Now take me to that rascal nephew of mine.

54:37.840 --> 54:40.840
If you really know where he is, do you hear me?

54:40.840 --> 54:43.840
Do you have me?

54:43.840 --> 54:44.840
Of course.

54:44.840 --> 54:46.840
Oh wow, frivolous.

54:46.840 --> 54:47.840
Not really.

54:47.840 --> 54:52.840
If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too.

54:52.840 --> 54:55.840
Oh well, Frederick and I were frivolous once.

54:55.840 --> 54:56.840
Really?

54:56.840 --> 54:57.840
Of course.

54:57.840 --> 54:58.840
Oh wow, frivolous.

54:58.840 --> 54:59.840
Not really.

54:59.840 --> 55:02.840
If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too.

55:02.840 --> 55:03.840
I'd be frivolous once.

55:03.840 --> 55:04.840
Really?

55:04.840 --> 55:08.840
If you say so, I suppose I have to believe you.

55:11.840 --> 55:12.840
Huh?

55:12.840 --> 55:13.840
Look.

55:13.840 --> 55:14.840
What?

55:14.840 --> 55:17.840
Little May and Anne Jane walking together.

55:19.840 --> 55:21.840
What are they doing?

55:21.840 --> 55:23.840
Little May is plotting something.

55:23.840 --> 55:24.840
Really?

55:24.840 --> 55:26.840
Moomin?

55:26.840 --> 55:33.840
Sniffs are right, really.

55:33.840 --> 55:38.840
But sometimes he just can't withstand the lure of gold.

55:38.840 --> 55:40.840
Check me.

55:40.840 --> 55:41.840
No.

55:41.840 --> 55:43.840
Well you can't be right.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.840
Let's go back then.

55:45.840 --> 55:49.840
Fine, just take your time.

55:49.840 --> 55:50.840
Hi guys.

55:50.840 --> 55:53.840
Little May, what's the matter?

55:53.840 --> 55:54.840
We have a guest.

55:54.840 --> 55:55.840
A guest?

55:56.840 --> 55:58.840
Moomin Papa.

55:58.840 --> 56:00.840
What?

56:00.840 --> 56:02.840
Moomin Papa.

56:06.840 --> 56:08.840
Woah.

56:08.840 --> 56:09.840
So.

56:09.840 --> 56:12.840
This is where you've been hiding.

56:12.840 --> 56:13.840
What else?

56:13.840 --> 56:14.840
Wait.

56:14.840 --> 56:15.840
I have to shoot you.

56:15.840 --> 56:19.840
And I have to go back.

56:19.840 --> 56:20.840
Wait and Jane.

56:20.840 --> 56:22.840
No, you wait first.

56:22.840 --> 56:24.480
Oh, no!

56:24.480 --> 56:27.220
Ah!

56:27.220 --> 56:28.100
Wait, please.

56:28.100 --> 56:30.320
Momen Papa was sort of on his way back from a trip

56:30.320 --> 56:32.480
and then stopped by to play chess with me.

56:32.480 --> 56:34.320
Yes, exactly.

56:34.320 --> 56:35.160
No, yes!

56:35.160 --> 56:37.220
Momen Mama told her the truth!

56:37.220 --> 56:40.460
Oh, I sort of stopped by.

56:40.460 --> 56:43.060
Why are you so afraid of me, young man?

56:43.060 --> 56:44.700
Well, I'm not not really.

56:44.700 --> 56:46.040
I mean, it's not you.

56:46.040 --> 56:46.720
It's your money.

56:46.720 --> 56:48.680
I'm afraid of it, really scared.

56:48.680 --> 56:50.680
Scared of my money?

56:50.680 --> 56:51.980
Well, I'm not.

56:52.840 --> 56:56.340
It's perfectly good money at all in gold coins.

56:56.340 --> 56:59.840
Listen nephew, I'm depending on you as my only relative.

56:59.840 --> 57:01.840
Yes, yes, please depend.

57:01.840 --> 57:05.340
When I get too old to do it, you must look after my gold for me.

57:05.340 --> 57:06.840
I'm relying on you.

57:06.840 --> 57:08.840
No, that's not possible.

57:08.840 --> 57:10.840
I know and Jane, we can give it all away.

57:10.840 --> 57:12.840
Must be those who'd love to have it.

57:12.840 --> 57:15.840
Must be those who need it more than we do.

57:15.840 --> 57:17.840
Oh, a green pearl!

57:23.840 --> 57:25.840
She's crazy.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.840
Don't worry, we'll think of something.

57:27.840 --> 57:31.840
Oh, you would throw my money away without a cut.

57:31.840 --> 57:33.840
Why didn't you mean to hurt you and Jane?

57:33.840 --> 57:35.840
I know, let's put it all in the bank.

57:35.840 --> 57:38.840
Money likes being in the bank.

57:38.840 --> 57:40.840
My money would hate being in a bag.

57:40.840 --> 57:43.840
It's a terrible idea.

57:43.840 --> 57:46.840
Oh, no, banks are so nice nowadays.

57:48.840 --> 57:49.840
They all...

57:49.840 --> 57:54.840
Of course, they have flowers and shiny piggy banks and pretty paintings on the wall.

57:54.840 --> 57:57.840
Is that really true?

57:57.840 --> 57:59.840
Right, come on everybody.

57:59.840 --> 58:03.840
Let's hurry home and fix a welcoming party for Jane.

58:03.840 --> 58:05.840
Oh, you're right.

58:05.840 --> 58:06.840
You're right.

58:06.840 --> 58:07.840
You're right.

58:07.840 --> 58:08.840
Come on everybody.

58:08.840 --> 58:12.840
Let's hurry home and fix a welcoming party for Jane.

58:12.840 --> 58:14.840
A party!

58:14.840 --> 58:17.840
Yes, any reason is good enough.

58:27.840 --> 58:30.840
This was Grandma's best cake recipe.

58:30.840 --> 58:32.840
Welcome at Jane.

58:32.840 --> 58:37.840
Let's drink a toast to the only millionaire in our small circle.

58:37.840 --> 58:40.840
May she live a long and healthy life.

58:40.840 --> 58:41.840
Cheers!

58:41.840 --> 58:43.840
Cheers!

58:49.840 --> 58:52.840
Now, this is your welcoming party at Jane.

58:52.840 --> 58:53.840
What's the matter?

58:53.840 --> 58:57.840
Never in my life of I and my money felt ourselves as welcomed before.

58:57.840 --> 59:00.840
I'm so happy I could cry.

59:00.840 --> 59:04.840
Oh, and once you start crying, you just want to go aww.

59:04.840 --> 59:05.840
Not again.

59:05.840 --> 59:08.840
Please don't be unhappy at Jane, don't cry.

59:08.840 --> 59:10.840
Oh, dear!

59:10.840 --> 59:12.840
Mum and Papa!

59:12.840 --> 59:14.840
Mum and Papa!

59:14.840 --> 59:16.840
Yes, and Jane, what is it?

59:16.840 --> 59:22.840
I'll put some of my gold in a bank, but you must look after the rest when I'm too old.

59:22.840 --> 59:25.840
And why not?

59:25.840 --> 59:26.840
All right.

59:26.840 --> 59:30.840
We'll keep it in the cellar and make a nice little niche for it with seashells and moss.

59:30.840 --> 59:33.840
And I'll have someone go down and look at it every week.

59:33.840 --> 59:36.840
Don't you worry, and Jane, your money will be in safe hands.

59:36.840 --> 59:38.840
Not quite, but I had in mind.

59:38.840 --> 59:39.840
I know.

59:39.840 --> 59:42.840
But I suppose it can't be helped.

59:42.840 --> 59:46.840
It sounds rather nice, a cozy little niche down in the cellar.

59:46.840 --> 59:52.840
And if you take a look every week, but oh, dear, it will miss me.

59:52.840 --> 59:53.840
Oh, and Jane.

59:53.840 --> 59:54.840
Very well.

59:54.840 --> 59:56.840
I have made up my mind.

59:56.840 --> 01:00:02.840
I'm leaving this suitcase with you now, so you and my gold can get certain used to each other.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.840
Do what you want with it.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.840
Your friends seem to have ideas about how to spend it.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:10.840
Flying ships and botanical research sound rather splendid.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.840
Ooh!

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.840
Wonderful!

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.840
I'm so happy for you.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:20.840
Darn, I should have let us up better than flowers.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:28.840
So end of the visit of the credit and Jane.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:34.840
And I'm sure Sniff will be able to think of some other use for the gold.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:10.840
The moment, the moment, the moment, the moment.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:36.840
Here they are for one and all.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.840
The moments are about to come.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.840
Come on and sit down here with me.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.840
They're here for you on your TV.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.840
They are the moments.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.840
They are the moments.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.840
So come with me.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:54.840
Give me your hand.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.840
I'll take you up to a moment land.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.840
You can fly just like a bird.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:02.840
Sing that song ever.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.840
There were the moments.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.840
There were the moments.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:12.840
There were the moments.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.840
There were the moments.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:20.840
There were the moments.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:40.840
One day in Newman Valley, not long before midsummer on a perfectly ordinary day,

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.840
Sniffkin suddenly announced that he was going on a short trip.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.840
Where are you going, Sniffkin?

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.840
Well, not very far.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.840
I'll be back right after midsummer.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.840
But Sniffkin, you'll miss the bonfire at the big party.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.840
But why in the world are you going away?

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.840
There's something I've been dying to do for a long time,

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.840
and it has to be done on midsummer eve.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:10.840
I promise to tell you all about it, as soon as I'm back in Newman Valley.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.840
Little did Sniffkin know that before he came back,

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.840
the underwater volcano which had kept quiet ever since

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.840
Moon and Papa's youth would wake up again.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.840
What's all that smoke?

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.840
Is it the volcano and your father's memoirs?

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:44.840
I don't think I like this.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.840
I don't think I like this.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.840
I think it's exciting.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.840
Well, in that case, you can have it.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.840
Moon and Mama.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.840
Yes, what is it, dear?

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.840
This hammock is shaking.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.840
It's very unpleasant.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.840
I think it's that volcano you told us about.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.840
Yes, I guess it must be.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.840
Mama!

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.840
Papa!

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.840
There's a smoke rising from the city, Papa!

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.840
No!

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.840
Oh, that's very odd.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.840
What is it, Papa?

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.840
Let me see!

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.840
What's going on?

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.840
I don't know, really.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.840
I guess there isn't much we can do.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.840
Hey!

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.840
I can't see.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.840
Where is it?

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.840
Let me see.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.840
No, I'm at first.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.840
Yes, no, I've got it.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.840
Please, let me see!

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.840
No, I'm at first!

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.840
Moon and Papa, will these earthquakes begin your youth?

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.840
No, they certainly weren't.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.840
And this one's underwater.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.840
Oh, might net cause a tide of waves?

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.840
A tide of waves.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:02.840
Goodness, I never thought of that.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.840
Hey, what are you doing?

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.840
Snatch at me, lad.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.840
What do you think?

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.840
Can you see anything unusual, Moon and Papa?

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.840
I've never seen anything like it.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.840
This is very unusual.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.840
Oh, my!

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.840
I want to see it too!

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.840
Come on!

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.840
How can you bite during a catastrophe?

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.840
Whatever you do, don't!

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.840
Right the top!

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.840
Oh!

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.840
Oh!

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.840
Oh!

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.840
Oh!

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.840
You're so stupid.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.840
You should have let me have it first.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.840
It's all your fault, little my.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.840
Anyone can see that.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.840
How dare you say it was all my fault?

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.840
It was just fault the whole way.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.840
Snort maiden?

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.840
Yes.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.840
So why don't you stay over in Moomin House?

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.840
You'd be careful.

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.840
You look after her, won't you, Moomin Papa?

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.840
Certainly, Snort.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.840
I don't like the look of things.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.840
No, do I.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.840
No, do I.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.840
We better get inside, Moomin House quickly.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.840
Everybody has to stay together.

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.840
It's scary.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:18.840
You're in the earthquake, Snort maiden.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.840
Snort maiden?

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.840
Snort maiden?

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.840
Snort maiden?

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.840
Snort maiden?

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.840
Snort maiden?

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.840
Snort maiden?

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.840
Snort maiden?

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.840
Snort maiden?

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.840
Snort maiden?

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.840
Snort maiden?

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.840
Snort maiden?

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.840
Oh, yeah!

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:34.840
What's that noise?

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.840
Listen, can you hear?

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.840
A noise?

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.840
What noise?

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.840
I don't know.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.840
Sounds like water to me.

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:51.840
Oh no! What's happened? Movement House has drifted off to sea.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.840
I don't believe this.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.840
I think Movement Valley is flooded. It really is.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.840
What's happened to the kitchen and dining room?

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.840
Just because I feared.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.840
What are we going to do?

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:14.840
Movement Mama can't even prepare breakfast down there.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.840
Oh, good morning. You're up early today.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:21.840
Mama, Movement House is flooded. All of Movement Valley is under water.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.840
Oh dear, I think you're right, Movement. It's Papa's still asleep.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:29.840
Let's go and wake him up. He definitely wouldn't want to miss it.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.840
Boy, I'm sleepy.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.840
I'm even sleepy.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.840
I didn't sleep a wink because he was snoring.

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.840
Little Mai was snoring so hard. The whole bed was shaking.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.840
I'm going to have a nap as soon as I've had something to eat.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.840
Hey, Sniff!

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.840
What's this? Where am I? What's happened here?

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.840
Movement House has flooded, Sniff.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:53.840
Oh, Papa! This means I'll have to swim to get home.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.840
You'll have to dive to get into your house.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:59.840
Hmm, unless I'm mistaken, the water is still rising.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.840
Movement Papa, you've got to do something. Do something right away.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:06.840
I think you better start taking swimming lessons.

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:10.840
And don't worry, Sniff. I'll start organizing.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.840
What do you want to organize, Movement Mama?

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.840
Well, dear, I guess we should have some breakfast first of all.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.840
Yes!

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:19.840
But how do we get into the kitchen, Papa?

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.840
You just leave that to me.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.840
There, your kitchen.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.840
I've never seen it from above before.

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.840
Oh, my goodness.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:36.840
People should look at their rooms from above once in a while.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.840
Look, cars of food floating from the cellar.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.840
What luck we have a trap door!

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.840
Mama, shall I dive in and get them?

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.840
Yes, please, Movement. Be careful, Movement.

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.840
It's got to be done.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.840
Hurry up, Movement. I'm hungry.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.840
Could you get us some bowls and plates this time?

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.840
Sure.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.840
And indeed, the water was still rising.

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.840
It's coming. It's coming. Help!

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.840
The water's up to the third floor.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.840
What are we going to do, Movement Papa? Where's Movement Papa?

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.840
He's up on the roof, Sniff, with the others.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.840
What are they doing up on the roof?

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.840
Ah, there goes another poorly built house.

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:44.840
Why doesn't our house float away, Papa?

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:47.840
It's all very simple, dear son. I built it myself.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.840
If you hadn't, maybe we wouldn't be about to sink altogether.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.840
Here we are.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.840
Are you coming to help me, everybody?

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.840
This is one of Grandma's best plates, so please be extra careful.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.840
I know. But where do you think we're going, Mama?

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.840
Something will float by. Big enough to take all of us. We just have to wait.

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.840
I'm not gonna wait for that. I think this family's out in touch with reality.

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.840
Something big enough will float by indeed, huh?

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.840
I'm gonna sink my old skin while I'm still tired.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.840
This is something I should have done immediately, but it's not too late.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.840
Look, there's a whole house drifting by.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.840
Oh, you're right. It's very odd looking house, though.

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:38.840
Yes, it does look funny, but I think we'd better take it.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:42.840
Hmm. That's the one we're getting.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.840
Help me!

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.840
Stop! I'm coming with you!

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:52.840
Don't leave me behind.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.840
Where's that house?

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.840
Right over there. Just there. Can't you see it, Sniff?

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:04.840
Oh, that house. What? You call that a house?

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.840
Hurry up, Sniff! What are you doing?

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.840
I just changed my mind. That one looks like it's going to sink.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.840
No, it's fine. We're all aboard. Come on.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.840
I don't believe you. Soon as I'm aboard, it'll sink. I can feel it.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.840
He's scared of his own shadow. Let's leave him. Move any such a whimp.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.840
Come on. It's all right.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:41.840
Now, don't worry about me. You can let go of the ladder. I'm fine.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:45.840
Stay behind if you like, Sniff. Look what about your breakfast?

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:51.840
We have all the food here, and you might get hungry, and if you do, there'll be nothing to eat.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:54.840
Why didn't you say so before?

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:59.840
And now, hold the ladder steady. I don't want to be abandoned.

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.840
No, brother. He's gonna make it. You know, what is it he actually ever followed?

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:12.840
Hey, I'm falling on it. I'm falling on it.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.840
No, don't do the same. Don't shake it.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.840
No, don't shake it. Hold the steady.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.840
Excuse us. Hello, anybody home.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:28.840
Don't worry. We're not dangerous.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:32.840
Isn't breakfast ready yet? I'm starving to death.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.840
There's no one here, Papa.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.840
I think you're right. It certainly seems empty.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.840
Oh, and the most exciting empty house I've ever seen.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:48.840
Why do you say that? What do you mean exciting? Do you mean interesting or do you mean scary little my?

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.840
Interesting and scary. Look, Snorgmaiden. Look around.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.840
Oh, what a lot of mirrors.

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.840
This house must have been full of women who loved clothes.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.840
Or maybe just one woman, Snorgmaiden, who had as many faces as there are mirrors in this room.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:08.840
I don't like that. Look, every mirror has a chair in front of it.

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:13.840
It's like so. This house was full of ladies and each had her own little mirror.

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:23.840
Thank goodness we brought some plates with us.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:29.840
Woman, mama, woman, mama. Look what I found. Bread and apples.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.840
How nice, sniff. Now we can have a real breakfast.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.840
But where is everybody?

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.840
Well, I don't know. Somewhere around.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.840
Whoever lived here must have had a lot of strange hobbies.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:49.840
You're so right.

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.840
Who said that?

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.840
Wow, look at that cog wheel. This snork would love that.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.840
I wonder what woman will say about this little mind?

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.840
I'm sure he'll say you look better without anything.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.840
But one look at you and he won't even notice anything else.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.840
Well, if he has any sense, he will fall for me like a ton of bricks.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.840
You want about breakfast, woman, mama?

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:18.840
We'll have breakfast as soon as we are all here. I wonder where they can all be.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.840
You know, it's very bad for me to go hungry. I always feel unwell if I don't eat.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.840
All right, sniff. You go ahead. But mind you don't eat all the apples.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.840
Leave some for the others, won't you?

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:34.840
Oh, don't worry. Of course I will, mom and mama.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.840
This is an apple.

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:45.840
Oh, but where on earth did you find them, Sniff?

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.840
In a frugal.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.840
But normal trick to play on people making false fruit.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.840
I very upset.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.840
Oh, this is not bread.

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.840
Who?

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.840
Who could have done such a cruel thing to me?

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:08.840
Somebody with a very odd sense of humor, I'd say.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.840
Somebody without anything.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:14.840
Have some cheese instead, that at least comes from Moomin Valley.

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.840
And it looks delicious.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:21.840
Whatever these levers for.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.840
Uh-huh.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.840
What's that hear you sound? It's creepy.

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:31.840
Can't you hear it? It sounds like a new earthquake.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.840
Yes, I can hear it.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.840
It's scary and spooky and creepy. All you need is try to be out of my mind.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:42.840
Oh, I wonder what it can be. It's very strange indeed.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:46.840
I just don't think I can take another earthquake right now, Moomin.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:47.840
Yeah?

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:50.840
Oh, my goodness. Oh, look. What is it, Sniff?

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:53.840
Look, Moomin, Moomin, look!

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.840
Why? Our table is gone.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.840
This is a haunted mansion, Moomin, Moomin.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:02.840
Well, they can't take grandma's plates just like that.

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.840
You could have them laid back, but I'll keep the cheese.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.840
I like cheese.

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:11.840
This is good cheese. You bet, Moomin, Moomin.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.840
Yes, I certainly did.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.840
Better not let our food out of sight.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.840
Let's get out of this house, please, Moomin, Moomin.

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.840
What's this?

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.840
What's happening?

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.840
Moomin, you'll have to get out of here. What?

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:27.840
What?

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:28.840
What?

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:29.840
What?

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:30.840
What?

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:31.840
What?

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:32.840
What?

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.840
What?

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:39.840
What?

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:40.840
What?

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:41.840
What?

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:42.840
What?

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:43.840
What?

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:44.840
What?

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:45.840
What?

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:46.840
What?

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:47.840
What?

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:49.840
What?

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.840
What?

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:51.840
What?

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:52.840
What?

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.840
What?

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.840
Papa, was it the witch who was laughing?

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:56.840
No.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.840
The doctor's coming from that ugly one.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.840
What?

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:00.840
What?

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.840
Be behind there.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.840
Did I hear someone call me an ugly thing just now?

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.840
Oh, excuse us, Madam.

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.840
You must be the owner of this house.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:17.840
No.

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.840
Indeed, I am not.

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:21.840
Most certainly not.

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:22.840
You are greatly mistaken.

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.840
This is no house you fold.

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:25.840
This is a theater.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:26.840
A theater?

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:27.840
Yes.

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.840
This is a stage where the heroin receives a standing ovation

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.840
at the end of the last act.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.840
And the bread and the apples are props.

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:37.840
And the rumour you are playing is where the actors make themselves

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.840
up to become totally different people.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.840
Kings are murderers.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.840
Oh, and you are one of these actors?

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:45.840
And actress.

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.840
You understand less than nothing.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.840
See this brum here?

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.840
This is my only prop.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.840
I sweep the dust in this theater.

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.840
Oh, really?

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:57.840
I have wielded this brum for nearly 20 years.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.840
Would nobody help me?

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.840
20 years I have cleaned this theater beautifully.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.840
My name is Emma.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.840
Emma.

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:07.840
And you.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.840
You better remember that this is a theater.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:11.840
This is no ordinary house.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.840
And it is a great honor for you to be here at all.

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.840
That's true.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.840
Does this mean that we can stay here just for a while?

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.840
Yes, until the actors return.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.840
Today they all came to a low-verset.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.840
Wow.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.840
Really cool.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.840
Yes, it certainly is.

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.840
We'll try not to bother you, Emma.

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:53.840
What have you done?

01:19:53.840 --> 01:20:00.840
Oh, well, what have you done?

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:05.840
We seem to have hit a tree, so the house has stopped.

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.840
This is a theater not a house.

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:10.840
Oh, it's a rowing tree.

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:15.840
How lovely it looks, how nice you have crashed into such a beautiful tree.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:16.840
It's gorgeous.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.840
And that smell.

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:19.840
You know what?

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.840
I'd like to spend the night in that great idea, movement.

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.840
I'm coming with you, how exciting.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.840
You better stay here.

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:28.840
You're bound to fall into the water.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:30.840
Look who's talking.

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:31.840
Scary cat.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.840
That looks safe.

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.840
We could easily spend the night here.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.840
We better tie the theater to the tree, so it won't drift away.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.840
If that's all right with Emma.

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.840
Emma, is it all right to tie the theater to the tree?

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.840
Do what you want.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:48.840
As long as you don't damage the theater to get here.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.840
All right.

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:53.840
Don't whistle you idiot.

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.840
Don't ever whistle in a theater.

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.840
That's the worst luck possible.

01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.840
Oh, how dare you.

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:00.840
Oh.

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.840
This is great snorkemaiden.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.840
We can look at the moon.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:18.840
And the flowers.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.840
They smell so good.

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.840
What's the matter?

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.840
I hope that snorke's all right.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:26.840
Don't you worry.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:30.840
He was standing guard over a flying ship after all.

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:34.840
All you have to do is get on board and fly away.

01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:00.840
What's going on here?

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:01.840
Huh?

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:08.840
No, they're trying to destroy the pamphor's box.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.840
I've never seen anything like it.

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.840
These people are bunch of vandals.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.840
Oh.

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:30.840
Meanwhile, movement and snorkemaiden are fast asleep,

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.840
blissfully unaware of what was happening.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:38.840
But whatever will they do, stranded on the treetop?

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:41.840
They love those afterruns.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.840
They're not the only ones who can get on board.

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.840
They're the only ones who can get on board.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.840
They're the only ones who can get on board.

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:50.840
They're the only ones who can get on board.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.840
They're the only ones who can get on board.

01:22:53.840 --> 01:23:00.840
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:07.840
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:11.840
They're always happy and goes at play.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:15.840
The movements are having fun day after day.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:28.840
The movements, the movements, the movements.

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:54.840
Here they are for one and all.

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.840
The movements are about to come.

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.840
Come on and sit down here with me.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.840
They're here for you on your TV.

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:05.840
They are the movements.

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.840
They are the movements.

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:11.840
So come with me, give me your hand.

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:14.840
I'll take you up to a movement land.

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.840
You can fly just like a bird.

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.840
Sing that song ever.

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:22.840
There were the movements.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.840
There were the movements.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:34.840
There were the movements.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.840
There were the movements.

01:24:44.840 --> 01:25:06.280
The sun was high in the sky, and the floating theater had floated away a long time ago.

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:14.120
Oh, I feel so good.

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:19.320
I really slept like a log all night.

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:27.400
It's so lovely to be out in the fresh air with Moomin and a tree in blue.

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:34.120
No! No! The house is gone! I mean, the theater is gone!

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:39.720
Moomin! What? Wake up, Moomin! Wake up! There's been a catastrophe! Wake up!

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:43.000
What's a catastrophe? Look down!

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.680
The theater's floated off during the night.

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:50.120
I don't believe it.

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:03.080
It has! It's gone! I can't see it anywhere.

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:10.280
It must be far away by now. Moomin, your father's walking stick! Huh?

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:14.920
It must have got loose in the middle of the night while everybody was asleep.

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:22.120
Crying won't solve the problems, don't made it?

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:25.960
But we're stranded in a row and tree with water all around us.

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:41.880
Huh?

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:52.760
Huh? Oh, no! We're in a drift! We're floating away!

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.120
We're drifting away!

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.760
Oh, what are we going to do?

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:04.440
Moomin and Snorkmaiden are still up in that beautiful row and tree.

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.960
That's just typical.

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.920
Where is it? And the Hagenuim drifted so far away.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.320
He whistled last night, didn't you?

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:14.920
I told you never to do that in a theater that brings bad luck.

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.920
Help! Help!

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:28.920
Don't get back here, too happy. Let's go upstairs!

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.920
Stop right here!

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.920
Oh, little mind!

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:36.920
Oh, no!

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.920
Oh, that was me!

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.120
Oh, dear!

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.120
Oh, little mind!

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:45.720
Oh, get this hurry! You're so mean and so mean!

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:48.920
Little mind is drifting off.

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:51.720
Scenes were stranded and that's not a bad thing.

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.720
The aiders shouldn't swim about like that.

01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:04.120
I'm too scared to get over to your side.

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:06.120
You must be brave, Snorkmaiden.

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:08.120
I'll catch you so you want to fall, okay?

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.120
I told you so, the branch didn't break, did it?

01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:20.120
Thank you for saving me!

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.120
Are you all right, Moomin?

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:34.120
I can stand up, Snorkmaiden. Look, the water's only ankle deep.

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.120
Really?

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.120
Oh!

01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.120
Are you all right, Snorkmaiden?

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:46.120
Yes, it's so shallow.

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:52.120
I wonder where I'm going to end up.

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:56.120
It doesn't matter, I rather like this boat.

01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:58.120
It's a nice, I'll go back to sleep for a while.

01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:08.120
It's getting dark, isn't it?

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.120
Oh?

01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:16.120
Yes, dry land! Look there!

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:18.120
A fire!

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.120
Must be people over there.

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:22.120
Yes!

01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:38.120
Of course I forgotten tonight's mid-summer eve!

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:06.120
What a strange catch!

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:14.120
So the Moomin's split up.

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:16.120
Are they in trouble, little Mai?

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:18.120
Yeah, seems I was probably the luckiest one as usual.

01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:20.120
More!

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:24.120
I'm sorry you can't have any more, that's all I have.

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:26.120
I don't believe you, your bag's still full.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.120
Yes, but not with food, little Mai.

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:30.120
What's in it then?

01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:32.120
You'll soon find out.

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:36.120
Where are we going?

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:38.120
To a park.

01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:40.120
I hope there's a hot dog stand there.

01:30:56.120 --> 01:31:00.120
Those two over there are the park keeper and his wife.

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:02.120
Look, they're always watching.

01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:06.120
They guard a lot of poor orphans who come to the park every day.

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:08.120
Really?

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:10.120
Look over there!

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:16.120
Unbelievable!

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:30.120
Hey, what's this?

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:32.120
Hey kids!

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:36.120
Come on everybody, we're here to let you out.

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:38.120
Come quickly, hurry!

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.120
We can't go anywhere.

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:42.120
We have to sit right here so they can see us.

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:46.120
Yeah, otherwise they might lose one of us.

01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:50.120
What a lot of signs, no walking on grass, no shouting, no running!

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.120
What a lot of rules!

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:54.120
What are they good for, Snuffkin?

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:56.120
Nothing, nothing at all.

01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:58.120
And that's why we're going to pull them up.

01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:00.120
No, you mustn't.

01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.120
I don't think one is allowed to do that.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.120
And you have to walk on the grass.

01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.120
Yes indeed.

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:08.120
And I really like walking on the grass.

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.120
I always have.

01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:12.120
No buts.

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:14.120
Come on everybody, let's make a start.

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:22.120
That looks like fun, I'll pull some too.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.120
What are you doing?

01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:28.120
Can't you read, there's a sign saying it's forbidden to pull up times?

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.120
This one?

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:32.120
Yes!

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.120
Oh, oh, sir!

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:36.120
Oh!

01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:38.120
Oh!

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:40.120
Oh!

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:42.120
Oh!

01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:44.120
Oh!

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.120
I'm beautiful, sir!

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:48.120
Bye bye!

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:50.120
Oh!

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:52.120
Oh!

01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:54.120
There you free, go run!

01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:56.120
Okay!

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:02.120
Stop!

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.120
Wait!

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.120
Oh!

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:08.120
What an awesome pose!

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.120
My goodness!

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:12.120
Those little balls are shining!

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:14.120
Oh!

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:16.120
Oh!

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:18.120
Oh!

01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:20.120
That hurts!

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:22.120
Wait, right, those were howdy fat receipts.

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:24.120
Come on everybody, run!

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:32.120
Oh, get out of here!

01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:34.120
Someone help!

01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:36.120
Someone help!

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:38.120
They're after me!

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:40.120
Get down! Get away!

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.120
Quick!

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:44.120
They're terrible!

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:48.120
Where could that floating theater have gone?

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:52.120
They're still following us!

01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:58.120
Come on, you kids, you can go wherever you want!

01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:00.120
Do what you like!

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.120
Yeah, but I don't know what I want!

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:04.120
Me neither!

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:06.120
I think they want to go with you, Snuffkin!

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:08.120
But I don't know anything about small children.

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:10.120
I'm not sure I even like them!

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.120
All we have to do is find a theater!

01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:14.120
Mum and Mama will know what to do!

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:16.120
In that case, let's go!

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:40.120
A house!

01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.120
The lights are on!

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:44.120
Maybe they're celebrating with some relief!

01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:46.120
Shall we go there?

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.120
Yes!

01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:02.120
Oh!

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:04.120
At last!

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:06.120
Oh!

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:08.120
Hello, happy midsummer!

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:10.120
What can I do for you?

01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:12.120
Would you have seen a theater drifting around somewhere, ma'am?

01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:14.120
A theater?

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:16.120
Yes, you see a drifted away in the flood!

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:18.120
And my powers are on it!

01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:20.120
Oh dear, I haven't seen anything like that!

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:22.120
Oh, what a pity!

01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:24.120
Thank you! We'll look elsewhere!

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:26.120
Have a nice midsummer party!

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.120
Party?

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:30.120
Oh yes, a party!

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:32.120
Thank you very much!

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:34.120
Very well then, I'll say goodnight!

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:40.120
Did we say something wrong, Mum?

01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:42.120
I don't know!

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:54.120
What's the matter?

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:56.120
I think she's crying!

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:58.120
Oh!

01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:00.120
Hello!

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:02.120
Is there anything we can do, anything at all?

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:04.120
Aren't you having a party, ma'am?

01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:06.120
No, unfortunately, she's not coming this year either!

01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:08.120
Who is she?

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.120
My aunt and my father's side!

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:14.120
I invite her every year for a midsummer party, but she never comes!

01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:16.120
How sad! You must be very fond of her!

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:18.120
Oh no! She's an awful person!

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:22.120
If that's how you feel about her, why don't you invite someone else?

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:26.120
She's my only relative!

01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:28.120
So invite someone who isn't a relative?

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:32.120
Yes, why don't you invite us, for instance?

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.120
Can one really do things like that?

01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:36.120
Just like that?

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:38.120
Of course one can!

01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:40.120
Oh, how marvelous!

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:44.120
To be perfectly honest, we're very hungry!

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:46.120
I've made lots of extra pancakes!

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.120
Please come in and join me!

01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:50.120
Thank you!

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:54.120
Although we have drifted apart tonight, is midsummer's eve?

01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:58.120
Let's drink a toast to Mum and Snork Maiden and Little Mai

01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:00.120
and hope that they're safe!

01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:04.120
And we better drink to that no-good niece of mine, I guess!

01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:06.120
Who's that Emma?

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.120
My only relative!

01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:10.120
She lives all alone in a small house by the sea!

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:12.120
Oh, is she all alone for midsummer?

01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:16.120
Probably! I always invite me over for pancakes!

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:18.120
I don't like relatives and I don't like pancakes!

01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.120
And she's boring, so I don't go!

01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:22.120
Well, let's toast her anyway!

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:26.120
And here's hoping we'll all be together again very soon!

01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:28.120
Cheers!

01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:32.120
Oh, that was really good!

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:34.120
Everything was delicious!

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:36.120
I think I've eaten too much!

01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:38.120
Oh, please have some more!

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:40.120
Oh, this is so nice!

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.120
I couldn't eat another thing!

01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:44.120
It's such fun having someone to cook for!

01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:46.120
I'm so pleased you're not at my door!

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:48.120
All that's missing now is a bonfire!

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:52.120
We always have one on midsummer eve!

01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:54.120
What a good idea! Let's have one!

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:57.120
Over there!

01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:00.120
Over there!

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:02.120
Over there!

01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:04.120
Over there!

01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:06.120
So happy!

01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.120
So glad you came!

01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:10.120
See these?

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:12.120
The flood brought all of them!

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:14.120
They were lying all over the place!

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:16.120
So I tied them into one big pile!

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:18.120
Would they make a good bonfire?

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:20.120
Oh, a terrific one!

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:22.120
Definitely!

01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:30.120
Oh, wow!

01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.120
We've walked for miles,

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:52.120
but I can't see signs of a theater anywhere!

01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:54.120
Oh, don't worry! We'll find it soon!

01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.120
Huh?

01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.120
And what's the matter with you?

01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:00.120
I'm hungry!

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:02.120
Me too!

01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:04.120
I can't walk anymore!

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:06.120
We don't have any food if you want food!

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.120
You'll have to look for yourselves!

01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:12.120
Oh, don't cry!

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:14.120
Look over there, little lion!

01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:16.120
What?

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:18.120
Over there!

01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.120
And the lights are on!

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:22.120
We're safe!

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:28.120
We're safe!

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:30.120
We're safe!

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.120
We're safe!

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.120
We're safe!

01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:36.120
We're safe!

01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:38.120
We're safe!

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:40.120
We're safe!

01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:42.120
We're safe!

01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:44.120
Oh!

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:46.120
Hey kids!

01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:48.120
You can't go eating other people's food!

01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:50.120
You can if they are home,

01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:52.120
and it's just what's left over from a party!

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.120
In fact, I will have some myself!

01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.120
It's amazing! I'm always so black!

01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:58.120
Now we must pick nine flowers!

01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:00.120
Why is that Snorke-Middon?

01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:04.120
I don't really know! It's always nine or seven of something!

01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:06.120
Okay, nine flowers!

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:08.120
No, not the same kind!

01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:10.120
You must pick nine different flowers!

01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:12.120
And then what do you do?

01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:14.120
You turn around seven times like this!

01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:16.120
And then what do you do?

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.120
You turn around seven times like this!

01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.120
And then what do you do?

01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:22.120
You turn around seven times like this!

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:24.120
And then what do you do?

01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:26.120
You turn around seven times like this!

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:28.120
I get it!

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:46.120
And then you walk backward until you reach a well!

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:50.120
And then when you look down into the well,

01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:54.120
there you'll see the man you're going to marry!

01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:56.120
How did I get him up?

01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:00.120
I think I see him! What a clever well!

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.120
That I must try!

01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:16.120
I'd like someone more romantic!

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:18.120
Got you!

01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:20.120
What are you doing?

01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:22.120
I'm quietly now!

01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:26.120
Oh, all we did is pick some unprotected wild flowers!

01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:28.120
I know what you did!

01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:30.120
Hey, Snorke-Middon!

01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:32.120
Moon!

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:34.120
Ha! You know each other! That makes it conspiracy!

01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:36.120
But I tell you, we've done nothing wrong! Nothing at all!

01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:38.120
We were only celebrating!

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:40.120
Better for you, if you hadn't!

01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.120
But why? Can't you light a bonfire here, sir?

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:46.120
I must warn you that all you say will be used against you!

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:50.120
Yes, yes! I have a complaint from the parkkeeper!

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.120
You pulled up these signs from his park, and you burnt them!

01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:54.120
That's not true!

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:58.120
It is true that we burnt them, sir, but we didn't take them from any park!

01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:00.120
They were brought here by the flood!

01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:02.120
Older-dash! Here's the evidence!

01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:06.120
I've caught you, and that's that!

01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:14.120
Oh, I caught something!

01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:16.120
Oh, it's just a piece of wood!

01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:18.120
Had any ideas here?

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:20.120
Not a single one! How about you, Mama?

01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:22.120
Same here, I'm afraid!

01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:26.120
I just can't seem to think of anything at all!

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:36.120
You wouldn't have any ideas about what we should do next, would you, Emma?

01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:38.120
About what?

01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:42.120
Some ideas about how to let the children know where we are, of course!

01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:44.120
How does anyone know where a theater is?

01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:46.120
I don't know!

01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.120
Please tell us!

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:50.120
Well, you put on a play!

01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.120
A play?

01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:54.120
Yes, that is correct!

01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:58.120
This is a theater, and when you put on a new play, everybody comes flocking to see it!

01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:00.120
They come to laugh, to cry, to shout, and to applaud!

01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:04.120
And when your children hear of it, they will be hearing a flash!

01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.120
What a splendid idea, Emma!

01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:08.120
That's exactly what we'll do!

01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:10.120
Hmm, I'm sorry, we can't put on a play!

01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:12.120
Why not?

01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:16.120
We have no actors! They are pests, but one can't do without them!

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:18.120
I can be one!

01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:20.120
And I'm also quite good at acting!

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:22.120
I can act very well!

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:26.120
There are only three of you, and not one of you is an experienced professional actor!

01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:28.120
Don't forget, we have you, Emma!

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:30.120
Me?

01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:36.120
Well, I've always felt that I would make a rather good Shakespearean heroine!

01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:40.120
And we can each have many parts, as long as they're not all on the stage at the same time!

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:42.120
He isn't at so moment, Papa!

01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:44.120
Of course, it's possible to do it!

01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:46.120
I want the part that finds the treasure!

01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:50.120
No, that's impossible, we have no play!

01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.120
Nothing simple enough for the likes of you!

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:56.120
A moment, Papa, can write one, he's very talented!

01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:00.120
No trouble at all, my dear, any number of acts!

01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:02.120
But we don't want any number, we want three acts!

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:05.120
That's what all proper plays always have, moment, Papa!

01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:07.120
Let's start right away!

01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:09.120
We got to print posters!

01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:11.120
And clean the stage!

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:13.120
Whatever advice started!

01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:21.120
And this was how Woman Papa got started on a short career as a playwright!

01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:45.120
But while the birds carry news of the play far and wide,

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:55.120
what has to become of Woman and Snork Maiden?

01:44:55.120 --> 01:45:01.120
Their troubles are real ones!

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:17.120
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements!

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:25.120
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements!

01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:29.120
They're always happy and goes at play!

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:33.120
The movements are having fun day after day!

01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:37.120
The movements!

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:41.120
The movements!

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:47.120
The movements!

01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:05.120
Here they are for one and all!

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:15.120
The movements are about to come!

01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:19.120
Come on and sit down here with me!

01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:21.120
They're for you on your TV!

01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:25.120
They are the movements!

01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.120
They are the movements!

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:29.120
So come with me!

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:31.120
Give me your hand!

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:33.120
I'll take you up to a moment land!

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:37.120
You can fly just like a bird!

01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:39.120
Sing that song ever!

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:41.120
There were the movements!

01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:45.120
There were the movements!

01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:49.120
There were the movements!

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:53.120
There were the movements!

01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:57.120
There were the movements!

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.120
All over moving down, bits of paper were fluttering down!

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:09.120
What are you sewing?

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.120
How are you sewing?

01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:13.120
Let us know!

01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:17.120
They were even falling over the lake!

01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:21.120
What's this?

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:23.120
Oh, litter!

01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:25.120
There's some writing on that piece of paper!

01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:27.120
I think it's a message!

01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:29.120
Let's see!

01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:33.120
Moment, theatre presents, written by Moment Papa!

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:35.120
Moment, Papa!

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:37.120
The last children of Moment Valley!

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:41.120
Starring Moment Papa, Moment Mama, and Sniff!

01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:43.120
And introducing Emma!

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:45.120
Emma?

01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:47.120
It works in a theatre!

01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:49.120
Admission fee!

01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.120
Anything edible!

01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:53.120
They're putting on a play!

01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:57.120
So they can't be lost!

01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:59.120
I haven't seen a play since I was a kid!

01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:01.120
It was wonderful!

01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:03.120
The best play ever!

01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:05.120
All about a princess!

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.120
She fell asleep in a rose bush!

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:09.120
She was so lovely!

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:11.120
I've got to see that one again!

01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:13.120
But who will guard my prisoners, I wonder?

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.120
I'm a good idea, officer!

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:19.120
You could take the three of us with you to the theatre to see the play!

01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:21.120
Good idea!

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.120
We love the theatre, so we won't try to run away, officer!

01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:25.120
I promise!

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.120
Hmm, not possible!

01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:29.120
I won't let you out of this jail until you write out!

01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:33.120
It's forbidden to burn signs 5,000 times each!

01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:35.120
That's the punishment for vandals!

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:39.120
Well, in that case, you won't be able to see the play!

01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:41.120
Ah, who cares?

01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:43.120
I'll go!

01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:45.120
Yes, I must see it, I must go!

01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:47.120
So you'll take us with you?

01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.120
No, you stay right here!

01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:51.120
Well, then you can't go either, officer!

01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:53.120
Quiet! You're upsetting me!

01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:57.120
No, no! This isn't good enough! It's not true drama!

01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:59.120
Ah, please, moment, papa!

01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:01.120
I don't want to be just a lion's ugly behind!

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:03.120
But, Sniff, I did give you another part!

01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:05.120
I don't want to be a baby either!

01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:09.120
And she said you wanted parts without lines!

01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:11.120
You're the dusting a bit later, Emma, please!

01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:13.120
He's script should be ready now!

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:17.120
We have to start practicing for the opening night tomorrow morning!

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:19.120
Don't worry, Emma, it's coming along!

01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:21.120
I'm only half done!

01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:23.120
I shall never get ready in time, moment, mama!

01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:25.120
You're right to worry!

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:27.120
For the curtain will rise tomorrow, no matter what!

01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:29.120
Ha, ha, ha!

01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:33.120
Women papa will remember to give Emma lots and lots of lines!

01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:37.120
She's really looking forward to her first performance!

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:41.120
Now, leave me, I must be left alone to concentrate!

01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:43.120
The writer needs peace and quiet!

01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:47.120
There are some things I don't like about this script!

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:49.120
I'll discuss it with you after the performance, Sniff!

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:51.120
After!

01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:55.120
If it's a story about lost children, why do you have to have a stupid lion?

01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:59.120
I'm too good an actor to be cast as a lion!

01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:01.120
Keith, I'm out of my hair!

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:03.120
He's giving me a headache!

01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:05.120
You come with me, Sniff! We'll practice our parts!

01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:09.120
This could be a wonderful play if you'd only skip the lions behind!

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:13.120
I've heard enough about this behind!

01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:17.120
Remember, we have a lion's head too, dying to show his acting skills on the stage!

01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:21.120
This is my play, and I refuse to write out the lion's butt!

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:23.120
I refuse!

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:30.120
Here's the key! I want you to keep a keen eye on them until I come back!

01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:32.120
Do you understand me, cousin?

01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:34.120
Are they very dangerous?

01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:38.120
Yes, they certainly are! They bite if you let them out!

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:40.120
We certainly wouldn't bite anyone, obviously!

01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:42.120
I've had enough of your lies!

01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:44.120
Don't listen to my dear cousin, they do!

01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:48.120
Well then, now I'm up to the theater to see the play!

01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:50.120
Take good care of them while I'm gone!

01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:52.120
Excuse me! You seem to be a very good knitter!

01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:54.120
Oh, thank you!

01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:56.120
Nobody ever said that to me before! I enjoy it!

01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:58.120
What are you making?

01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:00.120
I'm not sure! I don't really know!

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:02.120
Nothing in particular!

01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:04.120
It's just that, knitting!

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:06.120
I'm not sure!

01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:08.120
I'm not sure!

01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:10.120
I'm not sure!

01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:12.120
I'm not sure!

01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:14.120
I'm not sure!

01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:16.120
I don't really know!

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.120
Nothing in particular!

01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:22.120
It's just that knitting is so reassuring somehow!

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:25.120
Nothing bad can happen while you knit, can it?

01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:30.120
The trouble is I always seem to forget to decide what to make before I start!

01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:35.120
But it feels nice and warm and I love the color!

01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:38.120
Couldn't you make socks? It's a very nice sock color!

01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:40.120
Socks?

01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:43.120
Yes, it's very, very cold in here!

01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:47.120
Oh, yes! That's a very good idea!

01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:52.120
Listen, if I knitted each one of you a pair of warm socks,

01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:54.120
would you really put them on?

01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:55.120
Of course!

01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:56.120
Of course!

01:51:56.120 --> 01:51:57.120
That would be nice!

01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:59.120
I'm almost freezing to death in here!

01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:01.120
It's so very, very cold!

01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:03.120
Is it really that cold?

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:05.120
Yes! My teeth are chattery!

01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:06.120
So I could hardly talk!

01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:08.120
Honestly!

01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:10.120
Oh, dear, dear!

01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:12.120
What should I do?

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:16.120
Maybe some steaming hot black currant juice would help to warm us up a little?

01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:21.120
Possibly, although it might already be too late!

01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:41.120
My cousin would be very angry with me if he knew, but I think...

01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:43.120
But you think why?

01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:47.120
I think I'll let you out so that we can all be nice and warm indoors!

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:48.120
Really?

01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:54.120
Don't cry now, baby!

01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:56.120
That's a good boy!

01:52:56.120 --> 01:53:00.120
Don't cry, honey! That's enough, baby!

01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:06.120
Whoa!

01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:10.120
Oh, woman mama, you need to show much more emotion!

01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:13.120
Try to be more motherly and more loving!

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:16.120
Listen to her, this is a very happy baby!

01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:18.120
How am I doing, woman papa?

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:22.120
You're just perfect for the part sniffing your performance was excellent!

01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:24.120
Whoa!

01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:27.120
Maybe I should add a part with some lines in it!

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:29.120
Whoa!

01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:31.120
Whoa!

01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:34.120
Whoa!

01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:44.120
Look at these! I think they might be ready by now!

01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:47.120
I hope they're tasty! They don't always come out very well!

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:50.120
You're so kind! We've had so much already!

01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:52.120
But they smell really delicious!

01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:54.120
They sure do!

01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:55.120
Thank you so much!

01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:57.120
Now I feel warm again!

01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:59.120
How about some more black currant juice?

01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:01.120
Or maybe one of these freshly baked cookies?

01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:03.120
It's very kind of you, but no thank you!

01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:06.120
I couldn't eat another thing I'm so full up!

01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:08.120
Me too!

01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:11.120
Oh dear, the party is over then!

01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:14.120
I'm afraid so!

01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:17.120
It's really sad, but I have to lock you up again!

01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:19.120
But at least I know you're warm in there!

01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:24.120
We're really sorry too, but you don't need to worry because actually we're not going back to jail!

01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:26.120
Oh, aren't you?

01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:30.120
We've got other plans! We're going to the theatre! You see my parents play!

01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:34.120
And I suppose I should say hello to my Aunt Emma, who works there!

01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:39.120
Oh, what shall I do? My cousin will be very cross with me!

01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:43.120
But you see, we're innocent! We didn't do anything wrong!

01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:44.120
You didn't?

01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:46.120
I swear it!

01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:49.120
Do I look like someone who pulls up signs in a park?

01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:52.120
We just burned some flats and left by the flood!

01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:54.120
But your cousin wouldn't believe it!

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:57.120
He jumped to conclusions, wrongful arrest!

01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:59.120
That's all it was!

01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:02.120
Oh dear, why didn't you tell me that it was?

01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:06.120
Ah, people shouldn't go to jail when they haven't done anything wrong!

01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:09.120
Ah, so we can go to the theatre, is that okay?

01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:11.120
Of course, better leave right away!

01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:15.120
My cousin will be very disappointed, but I guess I can't be helped!

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:17.120
Wait for me!

01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:23.120
I think I'd better come along and explain to that cousin of mine that his three prisoners are innocent of the charge against them!

01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:29.120
That's all right, all right, bring it in!

01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:32.120
Eh, that's right, Mum! Papa, stop there!

01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:33.120
Okay, sniff!

01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:36.120
Mum and Mama, what have you got there?

01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:39.120
A baby's crib! I want to use this in the play!

01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:41.120
If that's all right with you!

01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:43.120
Mum and Papa! Mum and Papa!

01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:46.120
I've just read your script and I think you have a big problem!

01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:50.120
Who is going to pay the parts of Mum and Snork Maiden in this play of yours?

01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:55.120
I don't know yet, we don't have any more children and Sniff can't take the part!

01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:57.120
Are you utterly mad?

01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:02.120
We only have a few hours before the curtain goes up and you don't even have actors for all the part!

01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:04.120
What kind of director is that?

01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:07.120
Maybe one of us could stand behind something and sort of read their lines!

01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:09.120
Wait, thank you! I did it!

01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:11.120
Let's hope the credits are proud!

01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:18.120
Hold on tight, all of you!

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:20.120
No!

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:28.120
Listen kids, you can be as noisy as you like out here but once we're at the dinner you have to be quiet!

01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:30.120
You understand me right?

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:51.120
The audience is waiting for us!

01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:13.120
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for giving up your valuable time in order to come to our show tonight!

01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:16.120
The world premiere of the Lost Children!

01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:19.120
This is a brand new company and the players never been performed before!

01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:23.120
Ladies and gentlemen, sit back and enjoy the superb acting!

01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:24.120
What's that?

01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:26.120
A baby's cradle, it's for you Sniff!

01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:27.120
For me?

01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:31.120
We sincerely hope you'll be thrilled by the originality of the plot!

01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:34.120
And so now dear friends, let's get started!

01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:36.120
Let's get started!

01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:40.120
Come on!

01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:44.120
Come on, come on!

01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:46.120
Oh, thank you, gentlemen!

01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:51.120
There's a good boy, don't cry honey!

01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:53.120
Please, don't cry!

01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:59.120
Hmm, oh, moment, snork maiden, my darling children!

01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:03.120
You've been lost for a whole month and we haven't heard a word from either of you!

01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:05.120
Oh, he's forgotten all about me!

01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:06.120
Shh!

01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:12.120
I'd give the whole world to be rid of this most terrible agonizing despair!

01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:20.120
Oh, I'll make your husband try not to fret, so I'm sure he'll be back before very long!

01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:23.120
Little children, come and free me from this plight!

01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:27.120
Your mother worries all day through the baby's awake all night!

01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:30.120
Come home, come home, my children too!

01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:33.120
With all our hearts, we're missing you!

01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:37.120
Hmm?

01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:39.120
Loud or Sniff?

01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:41.120
Oh, well, mama!

01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:43.120
But what's wrong with you, Sniff?

01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:45.120
This rocket's making me sick!

01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:48.120
Oh dear, and right in the middle of movement, Papa's play!

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:50.120
Oh, oh!

01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:54.120
Mama, let us set forth and find our loved ones!

01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:57.120
We cannot leave our baby here!

01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:00.120
Oh, anyone would love to have him sweet little thing!

01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:03.120
For how long, pray, do you think we would be gone?

01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:08.120
For as long as it takes, I can no longer stand being this frightfully upset about my children!

01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:11.120
Oh, baby!

01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:14.120
Yeah!

01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:22.120
Hurry up, Sniff!

01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:24.120
I'm trying!

01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:28.120
Hurry, scene two is about to start!

01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:31.120
Help me, somebody! I can't get out of here!

01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:33.120
When do they put the princess on?

01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:35.120
We still have very far to go.

01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:37.120
I'm afraid so hurry, movement!

01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:38.120
I am hurrying!

01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:39.120
It's for bitten!

01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:40.120
It's for bitten!

01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:41.120
It's for bitten!

01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:42.120
It's for bitten!

01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:44.120
What are you writing on that paper?

01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:46.120
My cousin won't give up, I'm sure!

01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:48.120
So I better write this 5,000 times!

01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:49.120
It's for bitten!

01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:50.120
It's for bitten!

01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:51.120
It's for bitten!

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:52.120
It's for bitten!

01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:57.120
A full two weeks has passed!

01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:59.120
Oh, what shall we do?

01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:03.120
Our dear children have disappeared from the face of the Earth!

02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:06.120
Oh, what happened, dear Apple, of my heart?

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:10.120
I think I sprained my hands really badly.

02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:11.120
Oh, it hurts!

02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:15.120
If you were in trouble, apart from the wolves, we're all alone!

02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:16.120
I'll put you out!

02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:18.120
Stop!

02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:19.120
Stop!

02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:21.120
Why must this happen in my theater?

02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:23.120
I've been squeezed in here to make me look smaller!

02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:24.120
Help!

02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:25.120
I'm trying to!

02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:27.120
We can't have the lion on stage without his behind!

02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:29.120
Wow!

02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:30.120
I'm so new!

02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:31.120
Come on!

02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:32.120
Wow!

02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:33.120
Wow!

02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:38.120
We have to face the worst and spend the night right here in the wilderness!

02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:40.120
Dear husband, will it be all right?

02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:43.120
Fairly in these unhulled woods, I feel quite greasy!

02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:50.120
Sweet wife, I too can smell those frightful beasts, howling for a blood!

02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:53.120
May not just smell them, dear!

02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:55.120
Anything that I can hear them now!

02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:00.120
I can hear the howling of those hungry beasts!

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:03.120
Wow!

02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:07.120
Paint is the roar, but I can make it out a lion!

02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:08.120
Wow!

02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:10.120
Oh!

02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:16.120
Oh, sniff, what's up?

02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:18.120
Where are you going, dear?

02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:26.120
Oh, listen, I have to go and stop that stupid lion who's roaming around the countryside watching our every move.

02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:30.120
Hey, don't worry, I'll be right back, my dear.

02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:32.120
Was he supposed to say that?

02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:35.120
Hey, what are you doing here, you're supposed to be on stage?

02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:38.120
It's not my father, he's stuck in his crib!

02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:41.120
Woman mama stuck on stage, raw lion!

02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:48.120
That lion sounds very close, my husband must be in great danger!

02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:50.120
All right, under that stage, both of you.

02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:58.120
Papa, I can't get this thing off, I feel sick!

02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:03.120
Ah, what are you doing, woman papa?

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:05.120
You can do it with a cradle on, sniff.

02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:10.120
No, I can't stop it, please don't do it, woman papa, laugh at me out there!

02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:14.120
Don't worry, nobody knows it's you hiding in there.

02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:16.120
Come on now, hurry!

02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:23.120
Ah, lion, a lion is this to be my most untimely end?

02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:33.120
Don't you dare laugh at me!

02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:41.120
Whoa, is that lion gonna eat, woman mama?

02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:44.120
Oh no, what might you do?

02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:46.120
What should I do, woman papa?

02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:48.120
I'm scared, can't be bothered to pee!

02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:51.120
Just run off across the stage, dear!

02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:53.120
We were supposed to run off together!

02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:58.120
The situation has changed, I'll have to come to your rescue some other time, dear!

02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:01.120
Oh, help me out!

02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:07.120
Oh, help me so much, please!

02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:10.120
Please, hold out, everyone!

02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:12.120
I can't really see it!

02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:22.120
Help me, please!

02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:25.120
Someone, come quickly before I get killed!

02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:26.120
Oh!

02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:29.120
Help me, woman mama!

02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:35.120
Help me!

02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:42.120
Oh, it's only snap!

02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:45.120
Little Maya, I'm so glad you're all right!

02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:48.120
Shirley, weren't worried about me, woman mama?

02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:52.120
Well, just a little maybe, but you're such a lucky girl, I knew you'd manage.

02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:53.120
Mama!

02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:54.120
Mama!

02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:55.120
I don't believe it!

02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:56.120
Mama!

02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:57.120
It's me, woman!

02:03:57.120 --> 02:03:59.120
And it's me snorting me in!

02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:00.120
Mama!

02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:01.120
Papa!

02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:03.120
Moments snorting me in!

02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:05.120
Is it really you?

02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:07.120
Come here and let me see you!

02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:12.120
We've come back, mama!

02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:14.120
I was dying to see you!

02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:16.120
Oh, it's wonderful to have you back!

02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:18.120
Isn't that my niece?

02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:20.120
And Emma!

02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:21.120
Oh!

02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:23.120
You look so grown up!

02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:28.120
And Emma, so sorry to have missed your show, but I have so much to tell you!

02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:32.120
Hi, everybody!

02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:34.120
That was a great performance!

02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:36.120
Snortkin, I'm so glad to see you!

02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:37.120
Glad you're safe, woman!

02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:38.120
Help me!

02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:39.120
Hey!

02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:41.120
Those are my prisoners!

02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:43.120
They've escaped from jail!

02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:44.120
Catch them!

02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:47.120
No, cousin!

02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:50.120
I let them out because they swear they're innocent!

02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:53.120
They didn't pull up a single one of those signs!

02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:54.120
That's right!

02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:56.120
I was the one who did that deliberately!

02:04:56.120 --> 02:04:58.120
And I helped him!

02:04:58.120 --> 02:04:59.120
Very well!

02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:00.120
You're both under arrest!

02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:01.120
No!

02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:02.120
No!

02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:04.120
No!

02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:06.120
Who are these dreadful children?

02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:07.120
Dear, dear cousin.

02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:11.120
It's forbidden, it's forbidden.

02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:14.120
Five thousand times, that's what you wanted.

02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:16.120
And are you sure there are five thousand?

02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:17.120
Oh, yes, quite sure.

02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:19.120
I've counted them.

02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:22.120
One, two, three, four.

02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:24.120
Now that we are all together again,

02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:27.120
I would really like to go back to Moomin Valley.

02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:29.120
What shall we do with all these little pests?

02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:30.120
Snortkin?

02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:31.120
Well, little Mai.

02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:33.120
Someone might like to foster them.

02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:36.120
You can leave them in my car, sir.

02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:38.120
And yours, Emma?

02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:39.120
Yes!

02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:41.120
Now I have some acting experience.

02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:43.120
I think I would like to start an acting school,

02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:45.120
exactly what this theater needs.

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:46.120
What a good idea!

02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:48.120
Do you think I would be too old to attend?

02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:50.120
Perhaps character parts.

02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:51.120
Like in my play.

02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:54.120
All is arranged for the best, so now we can go home.

02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:57.120
It is Moomin Papa, I think it's high time.

02:05:57.120 --> 02:06:00.120
Quiet, please, I've lost my cap.

02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:03.120
Now I'll have to start again right from the beginning.

02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:06.120
Moomin Papa, do you think we should thank the audience

02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:09.120
for their patience because they're still watching us, you know?

02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:12.120
No, you're right.

02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:16.120
Ladies and gentlemen, that's all for tonight.

02:06:16.120 --> 02:06:19.120
I hope you have enjoyed the performance.

02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:23.120
I think it was very kind of you to stay to the very end.

02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:38.120
Sometimes I could almost believe the truth is strange

02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:40.120
or the fiction of it.

02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:42.120
Well, it is, isn't it, Moomin Papa?

02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:46.120
No, not really, we writers are no better.

02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:48.120
Go write more plays.

02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:51.120
Oh, what a very good idea, Moomin Papa.

02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:54.120
I think you're as good with plays as you are with memoirs.

02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:55.120
What are you two?

02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:59.120
Right, I'll start on the sequel as soon as we're all back home.

02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:05.120
There it is, I lovely home.

02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:07.120
At least I got a proper wash.

02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:09.120
I've never seen it so clean.

02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:10.120
What about in sign?

02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:13.120
Oh, redecorated, probably.

02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:14.120
Yeah.

02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:15.120
Let's go.

02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:18.120
The Moomin family spent the whole of the following week

02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:20.120
making their house cozy and comfortable.

02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:23.120
And soon each carpet, each cup and saucer

02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:27.120
and every piece of furniture was back in its proper place once again.

02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:45.120
No caring and giving the Moomin's.

02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:49.120
They're always happy and goes at play.

02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:52.120
The Moomin's are having fun day after day.

02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:56.120
The Moomin's.

02:07:56.120 --> 02:08:00.120
The Moomin's.

02:08:00.120 --> 02:08:05.120
The Moomin's.

02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:15.120
The Moomin's.

02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:45.120
The Moomin's.

02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:48.120
They are the Moomin's.

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:51.120
So come with me, give me your hand.

02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:54.120
I'll take you up to Moomin land.

02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:57.120
You can fly just like a bird.

02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:00.120
Sing that song ever.

02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:05.120
There were the Moomin's.

02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:09.120
There were the Moomin's.

02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:14.120
There were the Moomin's.

02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:18.120
Bop, bop, bop, bop.

02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:28.120
One night, Moomin was having a dream.

02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:32.120
What a wonderful feeling to be flying like this.

02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:34.120
Look over there, Moomin.

02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:36.120
What a beautiful lake.

02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:40.120
It's one of the most fantastic experiences I've ever had.

02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:41.120
Me too.

02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:44.120
I never knew birds had such a marvelous life.

02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:48.120
Seeing things from a completely different point of view.

02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:51.120
We're flying pretty high, aren't we?

02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:53.120
I'm scared.

02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:55.120
We're much too high.

02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:59.120
Let's go down, please. Let's go down at once.

02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:03.120
I'm not scared of heights.

02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:07.120
You know, aren't this time you really have succeeded?

02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:11.120
Well, I could build hundreds of these if you wanted me to.

02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:14.120
Snork, can I steer just for a little while?

02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:16.120
Now you can.

02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:18.120
Oh, thank you.

02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:23.120
Do you really know how to steer this thing?

02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:27.120
Hey, stop it, stinky.

02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:30.120
That's dangerous.

02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:36.120
This is okay.

02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:40.120
Really? It's just a dream.

02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:02.120
Oh gosh, my head hurt so much.

02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:05.120
What a strange dream.

02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:08.120
Why would my brother let stinky steer his flying ship?

02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:10.120
Surely not.

02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:13.120
I was talking to the snork while I looked away.

02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:15.120
Suddenly stinky took his place.

02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:17.120
Oh, and then the thing began tilting.

02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:20.120
Hmm, but it was just a dream.

02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:22.120
I don't care. I don't like it.

02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:25.120
You shouldn't have dreams like that just when my brother's flying ship is almost ready.

02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:28.120
Dreams often come true, you know.

02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:31.120
But it was nothing like the ship your brother's building.

02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:33.120
It was totally different.

02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:35.120
But tell me what happened to it in the end.

02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:37.120
Did it fall down?

02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:38.120
I don't know.

02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:41.120
I lost sight of it when I fell off and I didn't see it again.

02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:44.120
Well, surely you could have turned your head to take a look.

02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:46.120
Well, I didn't.

02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:49.120
Listen, moment, don't say a word to the snork about this.

02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:52.120
He's nervous enough as it is.

02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:53.120
Of course not.

02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:55.120
Why don't we just forget about it?

02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:57.120
Pretend it never happened, eh?

02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:01.120
Oh, snork, it's finally completed.

02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:04.120
Sure it is. But it hasn't been flown yet, of course.

02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:06.120
But it will. I won't snork.

02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:08.120
You don't think there's anything wrong with it?

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:10.120
Of course not. But it's just...

02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:12.120
Is there some problem, snork?

02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:14.120
Well, there might be.

02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:16.120
So, what is it?

02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:17.120
Fuel.

02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:18.120
Fuel?

02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:21.120
But you said you had developed a new fuel that was really good.

02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:23.120
It's good.

02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:27.120
But you see, you see, it might not be powerful enough.

02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:30.120
You mean it might not be able to fly?

02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:32.120
No, it won't. You're quite right.

02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:36.120
Or it will just be an ordinary ship, not a flying ship.

02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:40.120
Oh, that would be nice. What can't go up can't possibly fall down.

02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:46.120
But that's not the point if it won't fly. Everyone will laugh at me. I know they will.

02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:48.120
I won't laugh, I promise.

02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:50.120
Maybe not. Others will.

02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:55.120
But you wouldn't care about that, would you? Who cares what other people think?

02:12:55.120 --> 02:13:00.120
The thing is, I've already told people that the test flight will be quite soon in public.

02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:05.120
But I'm sure people will be very nice about it, even if it doesn't get off the ground.

02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:08.120
That's hardly what I want.

02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:11.120
Moomin, I'd like to ask you a favor.

02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:14.120
That's why I sent for you. Will you help me?

02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:17.120
I'll do anything. You ask snork, of course.

02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:21.120
What I would like is for you, Moomin, my friend, to be test pilot for me tomorrow.

02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:24.120
You want me to be a pilot?

02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:54.120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

02:13:54.120 --> 02:14:24.120
Oh, moment! Listen, Stinky, I'm going to steer that ship. Is that perfectly clear? You're not to touch the wheel. I'm a pilot now. What on earth was that about? Wouldn't you find it difficult to steer it? Oh, no, it's real easy. But of course, I'd need to practice before the public demonstration. Is the snorke going to fly his own ship?

02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:54.120
He has to stay down in the engine room, Snuffkin. I wonder if this ship will really fly. The only problem is the fuel. Only the fuel you say. That's a big problem. I suppose so. Listen, moment. Suppose now the snorke's flying ship really gets off the ground. Well, of course, it's going to, Papa. That something could happen. Something could break or you could fall into an air pocket. It's such a dangerous undertaking. Think, moment.

02:14:54.120 --> 02:15:24.120
Now listen, it's not natural for moments to fly about up in the air. Is it snuffkin? Quite right. What would you and the snorke do if things went wrong? We will be wearing parachutes, you know? Parachutes. You do know what they are, don't you, Papa? Of course I do. They come down from the sky like this, like this. Exactly. But of course, we won't need a parachute. Because nothing will go wrong. And I will be the first flying ship pilot.

02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:54.120
Whatever. Oh. Hi there. Hello, my young man. Hello. How do you do? How do you do everybody? Hello, sir. I wonder if you can help me. Do you happen to know where the snorke's factory is? You mean the ship? I must see him. I'm most eager to have a look at his famous flying ship. How do you know about that? It's supposed to be very secret. The information must have leaked out somehow.

02:15:54.120 --> 02:16:24.120
Oh well. All inventors know about what he is trying to do. He's famous throughout Moomin Valley this snorke. Really? Are you an inventor, too? Indeed I am. One of the more famous. I think maybe the most famous of them all. I am Moomin Papa. How do you do, sir? I'm snuffkin. And my name is Moomin. Please to meet you. A very good day to you, one and all. The muffles, my name.

02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:54.120
I said I'm the muffle. You mean you've never even heard of me the most famous inventor? Oh yes, I'm sure I am. The muffle isn't it? Yes, it is the muffle. Have you invented anything exciting, muffle, Mr. Muffle? I would be much easier to tell you what I haven't invented, young man. For instance, the pin that can't prick because it has two heads. The newspaper that reads itself the purse that moans and greets me.

02:16:54.120 --> 02:17:24.080
The bronze, if you take money from it, the adhesive tape that sticks only to itself. This is perhaps the greatest of all my latest inventions. Whatever is that? This is proper self a man-powered fan. Infanible in Moomin Valley. All these are my latest inventions.

02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:53.080
You didn't know that, did you? No, it isn't. But try and get a handkerchief, the square balloon, the five-wheel car, the hexagonal frying pan, the seven-hole button, and a host of others. Indeed, how interesting. What did you want to see the snork about? I thought I might be able to help him out with one of my inventions. That's what? Oh, dear, which one? My new? No, it's very top-sequence stuff I can't tell you.

02:17:53.560 --> 02:18:07.800
Now, where is the snork's factory? I'll take you right there. Very kind of you. Come, he'll be so surprised. Must be off, see you again. It's a pleasure to help these buddy-inventors. Snork will be so excited.

02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:21.240
A famous inventor, eh? What is your opinion, Snuffkin? Have you ever seen a triangular handkerchief, Moomin Papa? No, when I don't want to either. I do wonder what he's cooked up for the snork, though.

02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:31.720
It is sort of intriguing. Yes, indeed. Moomin will be able to tell us later, I suppose. Yes, but anything could happen before then. Can we wait that long, Snuffkin? You're right.

02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:38.360
No, wait for me. I'm coming with you.

02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:47.560
Oh, I thought we had several guests. Now, where in the world are they all gone?

02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:53.240
Hmm?

02:18:57.240 --> 02:18:59.240
Hmm?

02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:07.240
Now, where are they off to, I wonder?

02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:15.240
Oh, look who's coming!

02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:23.240
What are you doing here?

02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:28.240
We're just interested, then. Where are the muffle and the snork?

02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:33.240
The snork and the muffle are discussing some top-secret project. It's very harsh.

02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:39.240
Not a triangular handkerchief, I hope. I don't know, Papa. As I said, it's top-secret.

02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:41.240
Let's see.

02:19:43.240 --> 02:19:47.240
Oh, bother. The curtains in the way, so I can't see a thing.

02:19:47.240 --> 02:20:01.240
So this is the powerful fuel you've developed, is it, Mr. Muffle? Yes, it is. Not as original as my other inventions, I admit. But very useful. Yes, useful. I call it Super Fuel.

02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:05.240
Only trouble is my engine has been designed for liquid fuel.

02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:14.240
No problem at all, young man. If you dissolve this block of fuel in 10 litres of water, your engine will run for at least 10 hours.

02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:18.240
For 10 whole hours? That's incredible.

02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:24.240
If you doubt the word of the muffle, then try it out and see for yourself right now. Right now?

02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:31.240
Better still, I guarantee that if used as it is in a solid state, your engine will run not for 10, but for 100 hours.

02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:41.240
100 hours? But that's incredible. You really must be some inventor. Indeed, if what you say is true, it would solve the last problem of my flying ship.

02:20:41.240 --> 02:20:48.240
Oh, now that I've looked more closely at the padlock, this store isn't locked. No, it isn't.

02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:54.240
So if one wanted to see the snorke, one could work right here. But why would you want to see him, Papa?

02:20:54.240 --> 02:21:02.240
Well, why don't you tell us? I don't want snorke falling for one of the muffles crazy ideas, that's why.

02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:08.240
Well, we'll find out pretty soon. Maybe you don't realise it, but the snorke is pretty clever, you know.

02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:15.240
I think I know exactly what they're doing in there. Yeah, what?

02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:21.240
I saw that man pouring something into the flying ship. What was it? Well, I guess it must have been fuel, movement.

02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:27.240
Well, how come you saw him? There's a crack that's just about wide enough for me. But I won't tell you where.

02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:35.240
What are those two in there talking about? Oh, yeah. So this is the great super fuel? Wait a minute, snorke. There must be something wrong with it.

02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:43.240
What the hell is that? What the hell? There you are. Solid fuel indeed, huh? 100 hours? You're an imposter, sir.

02:21:43.240 --> 02:21:51.240
Oh, it isn't true, if you just let me explain. No, thank you. I know very well why you came over here with that ridiculous story.

02:21:51.240 --> 02:22:00.240
Off with you right now. Listen to me. It is not ridiculous, and it is not just a story. Maybe we shouldn't have dissolved it in the water.

02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:09.240
That was a mistake. Imposter, but I'm the muffler. I don't care. Maybe it's just a misunderstanding and the fuel isn't suited for flying ships.

02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:16.240
Wrong, it suits everything. Forget the fuel. That was just a trick so he could come here and get to see my flying ship.

02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:24.240
So the muffler has come here to spy, you mean? Ridiculous. I don't steal. Papa, was there anything you wanted to see me about?

02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:31.240
No, I just dropped by. No cause for excitement. The fuels are done.

02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:36.240
No, it's not. That's not true. I don't invent guns. What would be the point of inventing them?

02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:40.240
Oh, listen to me, please. Let's try and use the fuel once more.

02:22:40.240 --> 02:22:46.240
No, thanks. Once was once too many. I'll have to clean my tanks from your gunge. Get out of my sight.

02:22:55.240 --> 02:23:01.240
Oh dear, this must have been a bit of a disappointment for the snork. I know.

02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:14.240
Now listen, stinky. I'm doing this for the snork sake, isn't that so?

02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:19.240
I don't care if you're doing it for all I want is to get a good look at the famous flying ship.

02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:26.240
You'd need something very powerful to get a thing like that off the ground. Something so powerful that only I, the muffler, could ever have invented it.

02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:30.240
Remind me one day to show you my famous triangular handkerchief.

02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:35.240
Now all we have to do is not dissolve the fuel in water but use the solid fuel.

02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:39.240
Hurry up with that lock, stinky or maybe I should invent a lock pick.

02:23:39.240 --> 02:23:43.240
Come on, stinky. Hurry, hurry.

02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:45.240
There you are done.

02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:47.240
Good, come. We don't have much time.

02:23:47.240 --> 02:23:51.240
No, I'm dying to steer this ship.

02:23:51.240 --> 02:23:55.240
Me up. Take it up to 2,000 meters.

02:23:55.240 --> 02:23:58.240
Yeah.

02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:03.240
Oh, stinky, stinky. We're flying at a height of just over 2,000 meters now.

02:24:03.240 --> 02:24:05.240
Stinky. Yeah, I'm listening. What is it?

02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:10.240
When you hear me say now, that's when I want you to start off the engine immediately.

02:24:10.240 --> 02:24:13.240
All right, no problem. I guess it must be this one.

02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:15.240
No, no, not yet. This is it.

02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:18.240
Just a drop of water on the fuel block.

02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:20.240
Now that you do it.

02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:22.240
Can I start it now?

02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:25.240
Not yet. All right.

02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:31.240
Now, start off the engine stinky.

02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:34.240
Die, answer.

02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:38.240
Did you really turn on the switch? Yes, I did.

02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:43.240
The engine won't start. Are you quite sure you turned the one I pointed out to you?

02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:46.240
I think so. Maybe I turned the wrong one.

02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:48.240
There. Outside these two as well.

02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:50.240
Come on, stinky. This is no joke.

02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:53.240
My reputation as a famous inventor is at stake.

02:24:53.240 --> 02:24:57.240
This should do it, I think. Is that work, Mr. Mapple?

02:24:57.240 --> 02:25:01.240
Nothing is happening. I knew I shouldn't have let you do it better to do it myself.

02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:06.240
You're useless. Like Mr. Mapple, I haven't tried the very last one in the row.

02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:08.240
This one switched left. What?

02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:12.240
I better throw that one too. You never know. It might just do the trick.

02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:24.240
It works. It works. I know it works. I know it works.

02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:26.240
It is working.

02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:40.240
I'm not surprised, but I'm so pleased with myself.

02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:46.240
You should be here, Snork. This is my great moment. You should be here to share it with me.

02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:50.240
Come on, I can't wait to drive this thing.

02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:57.240
Incredible. This ship shall rise like a Phoenix.

02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:01.240
Not the most demanding engine, but this is one of my diesel inventions.

02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:12.240
Pass that! Come on! Wait for it!

02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:25.240
Come on, let me go! Come on!

02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:32.240
This is your power. I don't think engine has started up.

02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:35.240
I'm very much afraid it's exploding.

02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:39.240
He's thinking engines exploding.

02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:41.240
Where is the back of the ship?

02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:45.240
It's going to explode any minute by wonderful invention.

02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:09.240
I don't know.

02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:29.240
Now come to your nice room on the small side, but the very best one.

02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:33.240
That explosion. It really was most unexpected, officer.

02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:38.240
Everybody knows you're a great inventor. I wonder if you could help me, Mr. Muffle.

02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:39.240
But how?

02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:43.240
Could you think of something to protect my roses while you're staying with us?

02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:45.240
A non-explosive, of course.

02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:46.240
Of course I could.

02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:48.240
Piece of cake, officer.

02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:53.240
Oh, I really did want to fly.

02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:58.240
Come, come now. Cheer up, Snork dear.

02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:01.240
Here you are, a nice cup of tea.

02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:02.240
Thanks.

02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:08.240
It's very strange, but I had a dream the other night about a flying ship.

02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:12.240
Did you really move in? That sounds very interesting.

02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:14.240
Yes, very interesting.

02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:16.240
Moment, tell me about it.

02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:21.240
Yes, it was a peculiar looking ship totally different from your flying ship, Snork.

02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:23.240
Different? How?

02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:27.240
Well, it was sort of round like this.

02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:31.240
It had a propeller and something hanging underneath.

02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:34.240
And we flew over high mountain.

02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:36.240
Round?

02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:37.240
Yes.

02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:40.240
And you were in a sort of thing hanging underneath.

02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:41.240
Yes.

02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:42.240
Round.

02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:44.240
Round, huh?

02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:47.240
Round.

02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:51.240
What if it's the matter, Snork?

02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:52.240
What?

02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:55.240
Oh, mama, thanks for the tea.

02:28:55.240 --> 02:28:57.240
I think I'm getting a new idea.

02:28:57.240 --> 02:28:59.240
Moment, see you later.

02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:01.240
Papa, I must go.

02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:03.240
Oh, fair he goes again.

02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:05.240
I know that, look, mama.

02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:09.240
You won't get an intelligent answer out of him for the next month or so, honestly.

02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:11.240
I'm very happy for him.

02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:14.240
I must say that was a very clever dream you had, moment.

02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:17.240
I'm a better inventor than the mobile.

02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:20.240
You deserve a triangular energy.

02:29:22.240 --> 02:29:26.240
So the explosion didn't distress the Snork for long.

02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:31.240
And he was back in his favorite occupation, planning, but planning what?

02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:32.240
Round.

02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:41.240
Round.

02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:46.240
Round.

02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:55.240
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

02:29:56.240 --> 02:30:03.240
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:30:03.240 --> 02:30:07.240
They're always happy and goes and played.

02:30:07.240 --> 02:30:10.240
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:30:10.240 --> 02:30:14.240
The movements.

02:30:14.240 --> 02:30:18.240
The movements.

02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:23.240
The movements.

02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:32.240
The movements.

02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:36.240
The movements.

02:30:36.240 --> 02:30:38.240
The movements.

02:30:38.240 --> 02:30:41.240
The movements.

02:30:41.240 --> 02:30:46.240
The movements.

02:30:46.240 --> 02:30:49.240
The movements.

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:53.240
Here they are for one and all.

02:30:53.240 --> 02:30:56.080
Come on and sit down here with me

02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:58.600
Therefore you aren't your TV

02:30:58.600 --> 02:31:01.480
They are the movements

02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:04.480
They are the movements

02:31:04.480 --> 02:31:07.680
So come with me, give me your hand

02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:10.760
I'll take you up to a moment land

02:31:10.760 --> 02:31:13.520
You can fly just like a bird

02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:15.960
Sing that song ever

02:31:15.960 --> 02:31:18.880
There were the movements

02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:21.800
There were the movements

02:31:21.800 --> 02:31:26.100
There were the movements

02:31:26.100 --> 02:31:33.140
There were the movement

02:31:33.140 --> 02:31:57.140
When the henchmen first told Moomin about the golden fish, Moomin thought to himself that it must look something like this.

02:31:57.140 --> 02:32:08.140
My grandpa told me that his mother had actually seen it.

02:32:08.140 --> 02:32:10.140
So you never saw it yourself, Mr. Hamlin?

02:32:10.140 --> 02:32:12.140
No, I'm a botanist.

02:32:12.140 --> 02:32:16.140
It comes to the surface only under very special conditions.

02:32:16.140 --> 02:32:18.140
It's very rarely seen.

02:32:18.140 --> 02:32:19.140
Conditions?

02:32:19.140 --> 02:32:20.140
Yes.

02:32:20.140 --> 02:32:23.140
First of all, it must be right between summer and autumn.

02:32:23.140 --> 02:32:25.140
But that's now.

02:32:25.140 --> 02:32:26.140
Yes.

02:32:26.140 --> 02:32:29.140
It has to be in the afternoon sunshine after heavy rain.

02:32:29.140 --> 02:32:31.140
Oh, yes, that does narrow it down.

02:32:31.140 --> 02:32:33.140
And there must be no wind.

02:32:33.140 --> 02:32:36.140
Grandpa said not even a ripple on the water.

02:32:36.140 --> 02:32:37.140
Oh, dear.

02:32:37.140 --> 02:32:42.140
And there are some other conditions that he really didn't know about anyway to see it.

02:32:42.140 --> 02:32:46.140
You must be extremely lucky.

02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:47.140
Hmm.

02:32:47.140 --> 02:32:49.140
Just getting to the lake itself isn't too easy.

02:32:49.140 --> 02:32:54.140
It's way beyond lonely mountains.

02:32:54.140 --> 02:32:58.140
Going over lonely mountains and back would take at least two days.

02:32:58.140 --> 02:33:01.140
Not really, because I know a shortcut, Moomin.

02:33:01.140 --> 02:33:03.140
I could take you there and back in one day.

02:33:03.140 --> 02:33:05.140
Oh, could you do that?

02:33:05.140 --> 02:33:06.140
Yes.

02:33:06.140 --> 02:33:08.140
Have you already been there, Snuffkin?

02:33:08.140 --> 02:33:10.140
Just once.

02:33:10.140 --> 02:33:12.140
Oh, will you show me the way?

02:33:12.140 --> 02:33:13.140
You really want to go?

02:33:13.140 --> 02:33:14.140
Yes.

02:33:14.140 --> 02:33:18.140
I must see that golden fish with my own eyes and maybe capture it.

02:33:18.140 --> 02:33:20.140
It won't be easy to capture.

02:33:20.140 --> 02:33:22.140
Why not?

02:33:22.140 --> 02:33:26.140
From what I've heard, the golden fish is far too clever to get caught.

02:33:26.140 --> 02:33:28.140
I know, but it would be so much fun.

02:33:28.140 --> 02:33:29.140
You going alone?

02:33:29.140 --> 02:33:32.140
Well, Snork Maiden said she wanted to come along.

02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:34.140
She gets these ideas, you know.

02:33:34.140 --> 02:33:35.140
Just Snork Maiden?

02:33:35.140 --> 02:33:36.140
Uh, maybe little Mai.

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:38.140
What about Sniff?

02:33:38.140 --> 02:33:40.140
I think he wants to come along too.

02:33:40.140 --> 02:33:42.140
What would you?

02:33:42.140 --> 02:33:45.140
In that case, we'd better go across the mountains.

02:33:45.140 --> 02:33:46.140
Why is that?

02:33:46.140 --> 02:33:48.140
Why can't we take the shortcut?

02:33:48.140 --> 02:33:51.140
The path is rather steep and dangerous, you know, Moomin.

02:33:52.140 --> 02:33:54.140
Especially in the forest of witches.

02:33:54.140 --> 02:33:55.140
Hide the witches?

02:33:55.140 --> 02:33:56.140
Not now, maybe.

02:33:56.140 --> 02:33:58.140
Oh, so it's safe then.

02:33:58.140 --> 02:34:02.140
But it's a very deep forest dark and scary even in daytime.

02:34:04.140 --> 02:34:07.140
That's okay, we'll take the shortcut.

02:34:22.140 --> 02:34:26.140
Oh, dear.

02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:48.140
Good morning, Snuffkin.

02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:54.140
Sorry, Snuffkin.

02:34:54.140 --> 02:34:55.140
Guess I overslept.

02:34:55.140 --> 02:34:58.140
Snork Maiden, a little Mai, aren't here yet.

02:34:58.140 --> 02:35:00.140
You're very early.

02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:02.140
Hmm, I dreamt I caught the golden fish,

02:35:02.140 --> 02:35:04.140
and then, of course, I couldn't go back to sleep.

02:35:04.140 --> 02:35:05.140
Well, let's go.

02:35:05.140 --> 02:35:08.140
Shouldn't we wait for Snork Maiden and little Mai?

02:35:08.140 --> 02:35:11.140
Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?

02:35:11.140 --> 02:35:13.140
And anyway, didn't we decide to go back to sleep?

02:35:13.140 --> 02:35:14.140
Well, let's go.

02:35:14.140 --> 02:35:17.140
Shouldn't we wait for Snork Maiden and little Mai?

02:35:17.140 --> 02:35:19.140
Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?

02:35:19.140 --> 02:35:23.140
And anyway, didn't we decide that we wouldn't wait for anybody?

02:35:23.140 --> 02:35:25.140
So it might be better this way.

02:35:25.140 --> 02:35:27.140
What's better this way, woman?

02:35:27.140 --> 02:35:29.140
Oh, little Mai.

02:35:30.140 --> 02:35:31.140
Why don't you stay here?

02:35:31.140 --> 02:35:33.140
This will be a very tough expedition.

02:35:33.140 --> 02:35:35.140
I'm tougher than you.

02:35:35.140 --> 02:35:37.140
Wait for me.

02:35:43.140 --> 02:35:45.140
Hey, walk any faster, Snuffkin.

02:35:45.140 --> 02:35:47.140
I'm still so sleepy.

02:35:49.140 --> 02:35:51.140
Why did we have to leave so early, moving?

02:35:51.140 --> 02:35:54.140
To get there back in a day, Snork Maiden.

02:35:54.140 --> 02:35:56.140
But we aren't taking the shortcut, are we?

02:35:56.140 --> 02:35:59.140
Yes, but it still might get dark before we're back.

02:35:59.140 --> 02:36:01.140
I won't be able to walk back this fast, you know,

02:36:01.140 --> 02:36:04.140
because my bucket will be full of water for the golden fish.

02:36:04.140 --> 02:36:07.140
Well, don't be disappointed if you don't catch it.

02:36:07.140 --> 02:36:09.140
But that's my whole reason for going.

02:36:09.140 --> 02:36:11.140
But you heard what the Himmielin said, Snuff?

02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:15.140
We'll be extremely lucky to even catch sight of the golden fish.

02:36:15.140 --> 02:36:18.140
I heard him, and now's exactly the right time.

02:36:18.140 --> 02:36:20.140
Maybe the others made too much noise.

02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:22.140
We'll just have to wait and see.

02:36:22.140 --> 02:36:24.140
Don't you worry, I'll catch him all right.

02:36:34.140 --> 02:36:38.140
Where are they going, sorely in the body?

02:36:41.140 --> 02:36:43.140
How far is the forest of witches?

02:36:43.140 --> 02:36:45.140
I'd say about two hours.

02:36:46.140 --> 02:36:51.140
And can you also tell us how long from one end of the forest to the other, Snuffkin?

02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:53.140
About the same.

02:36:55.140 --> 02:36:58.140
Are there really such things as witches?

02:36:58.140 --> 02:36:59.140
No.

02:36:59.140 --> 02:37:01.140
Baby, because I'm not a bit scared of them.

02:37:01.140 --> 02:37:02.140
Aren't you?

02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:03.140
Not the least little bit.

02:37:03.140 --> 02:37:05.140
There used to be some, though.

02:37:05.140 --> 02:37:06.140
Well, of course, Sniff.

02:37:06.140 --> 02:37:10.140
Why else do you think that they call it the forest of witches, huh?

02:37:10.140 --> 02:37:13.140
And you're absolutely sure that there are no witches now.

02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:16.140
I haven't heard of any coming back.

02:37:16.140 --> 02:37:17.140
Mm-hmm.

02:37:17.140 --> 02:37:20.140
So you're not absolutely sure that there are no witches.

02:37:28.140 --> 02:37:30.140
Where's Moominer still in bed?

02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:33.140
He was off before you woke up, Papa.

02:37:33.140 --> 02:37:34.140
Mm-hmm.

02:37:34.140 --> 02:37:37.140
Oh, the golden fish.

02:37:37.140 --> 02:37:39.140
Good morning, dear.

02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:40.140
I wanted to go with him.

02:37:40.140 --> 02:37:43.140
But you're writing your memoirs you're far too busy.

02:37:43.140 --> 02:37:44.140
Mm-hmm.

02:37:44.140 --> 02:37:47.140
That's very true with the sort of a fish that no one has seen.

02:37:47.140 --> 02:37:50.140
That might have been a whole chapter.

02:37:50.140 --> 02:37:52.140
Do you think they'll catch it?

02:37:52.140 --> 02:37:55.140
No, my doubt it very much is highly unlikely.

02:37:55.140 --> 02:37:57.140
In that case, you should have gone with them.

02:37:57.140 --> 02:37:58.140
Mm-hmm.

02:37:58.140 --> 02:38:00.140
I do know a thing or two bad fishing.

02:38:00.140 --> 02:38:03.140
Snuffkin does too, but he's still so young.

02:38:03.140 --> 02:38:04.140
Oh, don't worry.

02:38:04.140 --> 02:38:06.140
I'm sure Snuffkin will manage.

02:38:07.140 --> 02:38:10.140
Oh, this is a spooky forest.

02:38:10.140 --> 02:38:12.140
Maybe the witch is every time.

02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:14.140
Stop it, little lion.

02:38:14.140 --> 02:38:15.140
Listen, everybody.

02:38:15.140 --> 02:38:16.140
Don't stray away from me.

02:38:16.140 --> 02:38:18.140
Promise you might get lost.

02:38:37.140 --> 02:38:38.140
Oh!

02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:44.140
Oh!

02:38:44.140 --> 02:38:46.140
Oh!

02:38:46.140 --> 02:38:49.140
Oh, it's so dark in here.

02:38:49.140 --> 02:38:51.140
Sure isn't so thick.

02:38:51.140 --> 02:38:53.140
The sun can't get through.

02:38:55.140 --> 02:38:57.140
That's because of those clouds.

02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:03.140
I can hear the wind, but we need calm.

02:39:03.140 --> 02:39:06.140
Yep, but we also need heavy rain.

02:39:06.140 --> 02:39:08.140
You're right. That's what the hamulin said.

02:39:08.140 --> 02:39:10.140
It sure looks like rain.

02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:12.140
Not only looks like...

02:39:14.140 --> 02:39:16.140
Oh, it's raining.

02:39:17.140 --> 02:39:18.140
Yeah.

02:39:32.140 --> 02:39:33.140
Here.

02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:34.140
Oh, thank you.

02:39:38.140 --> 02:39:41.140
My god, I saved this rainstorm with very sudden.

02:39:41.140 --> 02:39:43.140
Don't worry. It won't last that long.

02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:44.140
How do you know that?

02:39:44.140 --> 02:39:46.140
Vagabons do.

02:39:46.140 --> 02:39:48.140
This rain isn't that heavy.

02:39:48.140 --> 02:39:50.140
No, it's not bad, but we better hurry.

02:39:50.140 --> 02:39:53.140
We won't get to the lake till noon, and that'll be too late.

02:39:54.140 --> 02:39:57.140
I don't think we'll get very wet down here, Moon.

02:39:57.140 --> 02:39:59.140
So why don't we move on?

02:39:59.140 --> 02:40:00.140
We're so excited.

02:40:00.140 --> 02:40:02.140
What should we do Snuffkin?

02:40:03.140 --> 02:40:05.140
Well, we could move on, couldn't we?

02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:07.140
Yeah.

02:40:13.140 --> 02:40:14.140
Yeah!

02:40:23.140 --> 02:40:25.140
We really aren't getting too wet.

02:40:25.140 --> 02:40:28.140
We better find some shelter quickly.

02:40:28.140 --> 02:40:29.140
About where can we shelter?

02:40:29.140 --> 02:40:31.140
There's nothing in this wood except tree.

02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:33.140
Under a tree, then, I guess.

02:40:34.140 --> 02:40:35.140
Yeah!

02:40:36.140 --> 02:40:38.140
What is it, Snuffkin?

02:40:38.140 --> 02:40:40.140
There's a house over there.

02:40:46.140 --> 02:40:48.140
It's falling to rock and ruin.

02:40:48.140 --> 02:40:51.140
Well, at least it'll keep the rain off.

02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:06.140
Hello there!

02:41:09.140 --> 02:41:11.140
Anyone home?

02:41:12.140 --> 02:41:14.140
There's nobody here.

02:41:24.140 --> 02:41:27.140
No one's lived here for a long time.

02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:31.140
I wonder who could have been lived here all along.

02:41:34.140 --> 02:41:43.140
I know who it was, and so do we all.

02:41:43.140 --> 02:41:45.140
Surely you don't mean.

02:41:45.140 --> 02:41:47.140
The Witches, of course.

02:41:50.140 --> 02:41:57.140
Look around for dried spices, magic herbs, brownie sticks, and a black cat, a niren pot.

02:41:57.140 --> 02:41:58.140
A pile.

02:41:58.140 --> 02:41:59.140
But no, bro!

02:41:59.140 --> 02:42:01.140
No, the Witch rode away on it.

02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:05.140
No!

02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:08.140
There's someone here.

02:42:08.140 --> 02:42:09.140
Who is it?

02:42:16.140 --> 02:42:18.140
Let's get out of here.

02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:20.140
It came from over there.

02:42:26.140 --> 02:42:28.140
No, don't! That's okay, Snuffkin.

02:42:28.140 --> 02:42:30.140
We gotta get out of this place.

02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:35.140
Oh!

02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:42.140
I can't move, Snuffkin.

02:42:42.140 --> 02:42:43.140
Stinky?

02:42:48.140 --> 02:42:49.140
Pretty good.

02:42:49.140 --> 02:42:51.140
I bet you were really scared.

02:42:51.140 --> 02:42:53.140
I wasn't a bit scared, Stinky.

02:42:53.140 --> 02:42:56.140
It's very rude of sniff to faint when he hears my voice.

02:42:56.140 --> 02:42:58.140
Where are you after anyway?

02:42:59.140 --> 02:43:03.140
Oh, come on, tell me.

02:43:03.140 --> 02:43:05.140
Can't you even take a joke?

02:43:05.140 --> 02:43:07.140
Come on, wait for me.

02:43:21.140 --> 02:43:22.140
That way.

02:43:22.140 --> 02:43:23.140
Okay.

02:43:25.140 --> 02:43:26.140
Come on.

02:43:28.140 --> 02:43:30.140
Come on.

02:43:59.140 --> 02:44:00.140
This is it, isn't it?

02:44:00.140 --> 02:44:01.140
Yes it is.

02:44:01.140 --> 02:44:02.140
Where's the golden fish?

02:44:02.140 --> 02:44:03.140
I really don't know.

02:44:03.140 --> 02:44:05.140
I've never seen it either.

02:44:05.140 --> 02:44:08.140
With rain, sunshine, and calm, I'm sure the fish will come.

02:44:08.140 --> 02:44:10.140
The golden fish?

02:44:10.140 --> 02:44:11.140
Help me catch it.

02:44:11.140 --> 02:44:13.140
I just gotta have that golden fish.

02:44:22.140 --> 02:44:23.140
No!

02:44:29.140 --> 02:44:31.140
It's deep down in here somewhere.

02:44:40.140 --> 02:44:42.140
I can't see any fish anywhere.

02:44:42.140 --> 02:44:46.140
Maybe it was Hemiellin's idea of a very funny joke.

02:44:46.140 --> 02:44:49.140
The Hemiellin doesn't joke.

02:44:49.140 --> 02:44:51.140
Let's sit down and wait.

02:44:51.140 --> 02:44:53.140
I'm sure the golden fish will appear for us.

02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:55.140
I don't believe it.

02:44:55.140 --> 02:44:59.140
I mean to say you came all this way here just to see some stupid old fish.

02:44:59.140 --> 02:45:00.140
I came to catch it.

02:45:00.140 --> 02:45:02.140
Well, that's even more stupid.

02:45:02.140 --> 02:45:04.140
Hey, stop making those ripples.

02:45:08.140 --> 02:45:12.140
So they really got excited and walked all the way, you say?

02:45:12.140 --> 02:45:14.140
Oh, to be young again.

02:45:14.140 --> 02:45:17.140
Well, I would have gone with them if I hadn't over slept.

02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:21.140
I didn't know that you were that young woman, Papa.

02:45:21.140 --> 02:45:23.140
I'm not exactly old, you know.

02:45:23.140 --> 02:45:27.140
Pretty interesting to see a fish that hardly anyone's ever seen.

02:45:27.140 --> 02:45:32.140
Sniff said that he would catch this golden fish if it's the last thing he did.

02:45:32.140 --> 02:45:33.140
Oh, how?

02:45:33.140 --> 02:45:38.140
Well, he had a net and a very large bucket to carry at home, then.

02:45:38.140 --> 02:45:41.140
That's a good one.

02:45:41.140 --> 02:45:43.140
What do you mean?

02:45:43.140 --> 02:45:46.140
I guess I must have forgotten to tell you all the details.

02:45:46.140 --> 02:45:49.140
There's so much you don't know about this fish.

02:45:54.140 --> 02:45:56.140
Hmm.

02:45:56.140 --> 02:45:58.140
Can't see it from up here.

02:45:58.140 --> 02:45:59.140
Hmm.

02:45:59.140 --> 02:46:02.140
Oh, the hamulan was certainly right.

02:46:02.140 --> 02:46:06.140
Hardly anyone has seen this golden fish and we're not going to see it either.

02:46:06.140 --> 02:46:08.140
Maybe somebody ate him years ago.

02:46:08.140 --> 02:46:11.140
Stinky, be quiet, please.

02:46:13.140 --> 02:46:14.140
Did you see it?

02:46:14.140 --> 02:46:16.140
Where did you see it?

02:46:18.140 --> 02:46:22.140
I saw a fish jump, but I couldn't tell if it was golden.

02:46:22.140 --> 02:46:24.140
It was much too far away.

02:46:24.140 --> 02:46:27.140
With the sun over there, we just see the outlines, Nork Maiden.

02:46:27.140 --> 02:46:29.140
Yes, we couldn't really see the color.

02:46:29.140 --> 02:46:31.140
Look, everybody, look.

02:46:31.140 --> 02:46:34.140
I can see a raft over there.

02:46:34.140 --> 02:46:37.140
Hey, let's take it and go out to the middle of the lake.

02:46:37.140 --> 02:46:40.140
But it's much too small for all of us.

02:46:40.140 --> 02:46:43.140
Don't worry, Sniff, this won't sink.

02:46:46.140 --> 02:46:47.140
I'm staying.

02:46:47.140 --> 02:46:51.140
You do what you like, but you'll never catch any fish if you're afraid of water.

02:46:52.140 --> 02:46:54.140
Hmm.

02:46:54.140 --> 02:46:56.140
Stinky, you can help me.

02:46:56.140 --> 02:46:57.140
It's gold, you know.

02:46:57.140 --> 02:47:01.140
We can sell it for a lot of money and then we'll both be very wealthy.

02:47:12.140 --> 02:47:15.140
I think it was somewhere around here, wasn't it?

02:47:15.140 --> 02:47:18.140
Or, unless I suppose, hard to say.

02:47:18.140 --> 02:47:20.140
Well, I can't see anything.

02:47:21.140 --> 02:47:22.140
I can't see.

02:47:22.140 --> 02:47:25.140
There's certainly no sign of it now.

02:47:25.140 --> 02:47:29.140
Well, we'll just have to sit and wait here.

02:47:29.140 --> 02:47:31.140
We have no choice.

02:47:31.140 --> 02:47:33.140
And I'm not going home until I've seen it.

02:47:33.140 --> 02:47:35.140
I'm happy to wait all day.

02:47:35.140 --> 02:47:38.140
You won't find it by looking up at the sky.

02:47:38.140 --> 02:47:39.140
You know what?

02:47:39.140 --> 02:47:43.140
Fish like it in places where there are lots of weeds.

02:47:43.140 --> 02:47:45.140
Oh, the raft's in the middle of the lake.

02:47:45.140 --> 02:47:48.140
And they just want to see the fish, but you wait.

02:47:48.140 --> 02:47:50.140
I'm going to catch it.

02:47:50.140 --> 02:47:54.140
Maybe somebody's already caught it and you can get it in the tin.

02:47:59.140 --> 02:48:00.140
What did you see?

02:48:00.140 --> 02:48:03.140
Over there, something shiny jumping.

02:48:03.140 --> 02:48:04.140
What did you see?

02:48:04.140 --> 02:48:05.140
That's all you.

02:48:05.140 --> 02:48:06.140
Now keep quiet.

02:48:19.140 --> 02:48:21.140
I hate fishing.

02:48:21.140 --> 02:48:27.140
Guess we better think about getting back otherwise we'll never get home before nightfall.

02:48:27.140 --> 02:48:31.140
I don't want to get lost on a raft in the dark on this lonely lake.

02:48:31.140 --> 02:48:34.140
Perhaps we were expecting too much.

02:48:34.140 --> 02:48:38.140
Maybe your right's not made in, but I really thought we'd see it.

02:48:38.140 --> 02:48:41.140
This is the most disappointing day of my life.

02:48:41.140 --> 02:48:43.140
We can come back.

02:48:43.140 --> 02:48:44.140
Yes.

02:48:49.140 --> 02:48:51.140
It's not going to stop.

02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:04.140
Hang on.

02:49:04.140 --> 02:49:06.140
Did you see a moment?

02:49:06.140 --> 02:49:07.140
Shh.

02:49:19.140 --> 02:49:20.140
Oh.

02:49:27.140 --> 02:49:29.140
It's gigantic.

02:49:49.140 --> 02:49:50.140
Oh.

02:49:50.140 --> 02:49:51.140
Oh.

02:49:51.140 --> 02:49:52.140
Oh.

02:49:52.140 --> 02:49:53.140
Oh.

02:49:53.140 --> 02:49:54.140
Oh.

02:49:54.140 --> 02:49:55.140
Oh.

02:49:57.140 --> 02:49:58.140
Oh.

02:49:58.140 --> 02:49:59.140
Oh.

02:49:59.140 --> 02:50:00.140
Oh.

02:50:00.140 --> 02:50:01.140
Oh.

02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:02.140
Oh.

02:50:02.140 --> 02:50:03.140
Oh.

02:50:03.140 --> 02:50:04.140
Oh.

02:50:04.140 --> 02:50:05.140
Oh.

02:50:05.140 --> 02:50:06.140
Oh.

02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:07.140
Oh.

02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:08.140
Oh.

02:50:08.140 --> 02:50:09.140
Oh.

02:50:09.140 --> 02:50:10.140
Oh.

02:50:10.140 --> 02:50:11.140
Oh.

02:50:11.140 --> 02:50:12.140
Oh.

02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:13.140
Oh.

02:50:13.140 --> 02:50:14.140
Oh.

02:50:14.140 --> 02:50:15.140
Oh.

02:50:15.140 --> 02:50:16.140
Oh.

02:50:16.140 --> 02:50:17.140
Oh.

02:50:18.140 --> 02:50:19.140
We've seen.

02:50:19.140 --> 02:50:20.140
We have.

02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:21.140
Oh.

02:50:21.140 --> 02:50:22.140
That was right.

02:50:22.140 --> 02:50:23.140
I really saw it.

02:50:23.140 --> 02:50:24.140
I saw it.

02:50:24.140 --> 02:50:26.140
First it was I believe about it.

02:50:26.140 --> 02:50:27.140
Oh.

02:50:27.140 --> 02:50:28.140
Oh.

02:50:28.140 --> 02:50:29.140
Oh.

02:50:31.140 --> 02:50:34.140
Oh.

02:50:40.140 --> 02:50:41.140
Yachty.

02:50:41.140 --> 02:50:42.140
I love you.

02:50:42.140 --> 02:50:43.140
Yachty.

02:50:43.140 --> 02:50:44.140
I love you.

02:50:44.140 --> 02:50:45.140
I love you.

02:50:45.140 --> 02:50:46.140
I love you.

02:50:46.140 --> 02:50:47.140
I love you.

02:50:47.140 --> 02:50:48.140
I love you.

02:50:48.140 --> 02:50:49.140
I love you.

02:50:49.140 --> 02:50:50.140
I love you.

02:50:50.140 --> 02:50:51.140
I love you.

02:50:51.140 --> 02:50:52.140
I love you.

02:50:52.140 --> 02:50:53.140
I love you.

02:50:53.140 --> 02:50:54.140
I love you.

02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:55.140
I love you.

02:50:55.140 --> 02:50:56.140
I love you.

02:50:56.140 --> 02:50:57.140
I love you.

02:50:57.140 --> 02:50:58.140
I love you.

02:50:58.140 --> 02:50:59.140
I love you.

02:50:59.140 --> 02:51:00.140
I love you.

02:51:00.140 --> 02:51:01.140
I love you.

02:51:01.140 --> 02:51:02.140
I love you.

02:51:02.140 --> 02:51:03.140
I love you.

02:51:03.140 --> 02:51:04.140
I love you.

02:51:04.140 --> 02:51:05.140
I love you.

02:51:05.140 --> 02:51:06.140
I love you.

02:51:06.140 --> 02:51:07.140
I love you.

02:51:07.140 --> 02:51:08.140
I love you.

02:51:08.140 --> 02:51:09.140
I love you.

02:51:09.140 --> 02:51:10.140
I love you.

02:51:10.140 --> 02:51:11.140
I love you.

02:51:11.140 --> 02:51:12.140
I love you.

02:51:12.140 --> 02:51:13.140
I love you.

02:51:13.140 --> 02:51:14.140
I love you.

02:51:14.140 --> 02:51:15.140
I love you.

02:51:15.140 --> 02:51:16.140
I love you.

02:51:16.140 --> 02:51:17.140
I love you.

02:51:17.140 --> 02:51:18.140
I love you.

02:51:18.140 --> 02:51:19.140
I love you.

02:51:19.140 --> 02:51:20.140
I love you.

02:51:20.140 --> 02:51:21.140
I love you.

02:51:21.140 --> 02:51:22.140
I love you.

02:51:22.140 --> 02:51:23.140
I love you.

02:51:23.140 --> 02:51:24.140
I love you.

02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:25.140
I love you.

02:51:25.140 --> 02:51:26.140
I love you.

02:51:26.140 --> 02:51:27.140
How much do you want the old sponge cake cookies?

02:51:27.140 --> 02:51:28.140
I love it.

02:51:28.140 --> 02:51:29.140
Wow.

02:51:29.140 --> 02:51:30.140
I love it.

02:51:30.140 --> 02:51:31.140
I love it.

02:51:31.140 --> 02:51:32.140
I love it.

02:51:32.140 --> 02:51:33.140
I love it.

02:51:33.140 --> 02:51:34.140
I think it was cool.

02:51:34.140 --> 02:51:35.140
I love it.

02:51:35.140 --> 02:51:36.140
I think it was cool.

02:51:36.140 --> 02:51:37.140
I love it.

02:51:37.140 --> 02:51:38.140
I love it.

02:51:38.140 --> 02:51:39.140
Well, I envy it.

02:51:39.140 --> 02:51:40.140
It's cool.

02:51:40.140 --> 02:51:41.140
I envy it.

02:51:41.140 --> 02:51:42.140
Well, I envy it.

02:51:42.140 --> 02:51:56.500
Steth and Stinky never really got over their belief that it was actually the golden fish

02:51:56.500 --> 02:51:58.000
they had caught.

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:03.420
But moving in the others were in no doubt about what they had seen, the aim of the emilence

02:52:03.420 --> 02:52:10.420
they were in no doubt about what they had seen, the aim of the emilence, they were in no

02:52:10.420 --> 02:52:18.420
doubt about what they had seen, the aim of the emilence, they were in no doubt about

02:52:18.420 --> 02:52:25.420
what they had seen, the aim of the emilence, they were in no doubt about what they had seen,

02:52:25.420 --> 02:52:32.420
the aim of the emilence, they were in no doubt about what they had seen, the aim of the

02:52:32.420 --> 02:52:39.420
emilence, the movements, the movements.

02:53:02.420 --> 02:53:13.420
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here

02:53:13.420 --> 02:53:22.420
with me, they here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

02:53:22.420 --> 02:53:30.420
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land, you can fly

02:53:30.420 --> 02:53:37.420
just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

02:53:37.420 --> 02:53:48.420
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

02:53:48.420 --> 02:54:00.420
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

02:54:00.420 --> 02:54:05.420
Snoke made him was in a very good mood because that day she was off to collect shells

02:54:05.420 --> 02:54:15.420
of the sea shore with me, movement.

02:54:15.420 --> 02:54:20.420
Hey, look, the sun's up, and there's Gracie.

02:54:25.420 --> 02:54:27.420
Oh, rat.

02:54:27.420 --> 02:54:29.420
What's the matter, Papa?

02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:31.420
Oh, it's your moment.

02:54:31.420 --> 02:54:33.420
What are you doing?

02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:35.420
I heard you talking to yourself just now.

02:54:35.420 --> 02:54:37.420
Huh? Oh.

02:54:39.420 --> 02:54:42.420
You see this? I'm writing a play.

02:54:42.420 --> 02:54:43.420
Writing a play?

02:54:43.420 --> 02:54:45.420
You remember the last children?

02:54:45.420 --> 02:54:49.420
That was a very successful play, and just now I was repeating a line.

02:54:49.420 --> 02:54:53.420
Hey, look, another beautiful day, and there goes Gracie.

02:54:53.420 --> 02:54:55.420
It's a wonderful line, of course.

02:54:55.420 --> 02:54:57.420
Don't you agree?

02:54:57.420 --> 02:54:59.420
It could be improved.

02:54:59.420 --> 02:55:01.420
I think about it.

02:55:14.420 --> 02:55:16.420
Moment, moment, look at this.

02:55:16.420 --> 02:55:18.420
Beautiful.

02:55:21.420 --> 02:55:22.420
You find anything?

02:55:22.420 --> 02:55:24.420
No, just usual old stuff.

02:55:31.420 --> 02:55:33.420
Oh, there's another big one.

02:55:33.420 --> 02:55:35.420
Can't you really find anything, moment?

02:55:38.420 --> 02:55:40.420
I'll look somewhere else.

02:55:40.420 --> 02:55:42.420
I still think this is the best place.

02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:44.420
Well, I'm going off of there.

02:55:46.420 --> 02:55:48.420
You're so beautiful.

02:55:50.420 --> 02:55:52.420
Oh.

02:55:54.420 --> 02:55:56.420
What are you doing, moment?

02:55:56.420 --> 02:55:58.420
No, that's no shell surely.

02:55:58.420 --> 02:55:59.420
No.

02:55:59.420 --> 02:56:01.420
So why did you dig it out?

02:56:01.420 --> 02:56:04.420
Well, once you see it, you want to find out what it is.

02:56:06.420 --> 02:56:08.420
A very odd thing, isn't it?

02:56:08.420 --> 02:56:10.420
Not very interesting.

02:56:13.420 --> 02:56:16.420
Oh, no, I can see what it is.

02:56:16.420 --> 02:56:18.420
I gave it a good wash.

02:56:18.420 --> 02:56:20.420
I've seen one just like it in the fairy tales.

02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:22.420
It's an old lamb.

02:56:22.420 --> 02:56:24.420
Yes, you remember the story called him added?

02:56:24.420 --> 02:56:26.420
He rubbed the lamb and the genie appeared.

02:56:26.420 --> 02:56:30.420
The genie might appear for us if we do what Aladdin did.

02:56:30.420 --> 02:56:33.420
Don't be silly, Snork Maiden.

02:56:36.420 --> 02:56:40.420
But Snork Maiden, that was a fairy tale.

02:56:40.420 --> 02:56:43.420
Don't laugh. I just want to make absolutely sure.

02:56:43.420 --> 02:56:46.420
To tell you the truth, I've already tried it.

02:56:46.420 --> 02:56:49.420
My hands turned green. That's all that happened to me.

02:56:49.420 --> 02:56:51.420
Maybe you didn't do it the right way.

02:56:51.420 --> 02:56:53.420
You can't even whip cream properly.

02:56:54.420 --> 02:56:57.420
And I'm sure you have to say some magic words such as

02:56:57.420 --> 02:57:00.420
apricot dapura, spirit, come forth.

02:57:00.420 --> 02:57:03.420
Apricot dapura, try for all your words.

02:57:03.420 --> 02:57:05.420
You've chosen the wrong words.

02:57:05.420 --> 02:57:08.420
You should say, come out, say something or something.

02:57:09.420 --> 02:57:12.420
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.

02:57:12.420 --> 02:57:14.420
Keep going, Snork Maiden.

02:57:26.420 --> 02:57:28.420
I am the spirit of the land.

02:57:28.420 --> 02:57:30.420
What is your command?

02:57:33.420 --> 02:57:36.420
Goodness, did you come out of this lamp?

02:57:36.420 --> 02:57:37.420
You got it.

02:57:37.420 --> 02:57:40.420
So you really are the spirit of this lamp?

02:57:40.420 --> 02:57:41.420
Always have been.

02:57:41.420 --> 02:57:44.420
But I have the book and you're not him.

02:57:44.420 --> 02:57:48.420
I can prove it if you're quite sure you want me to.

02:57:48.420 --> 02:57:51.420
By all means, it probably wasn't a good picture.

02:57:51.420 --> 02:57:54.420
I'm the one and only spirit of the lamp.

02:57:54.420 --> 02:57:59.420
Then you must have the power to make any wish come true, is that so?

02:57:59.420 --> 02:58:01.420
Are we certainly but not yours?

02:58:01.420 --> 02:58:03.420
But I'm the one who dug you out.

02:58:03.420 --> 02:58:05.420
That's not so important, kid.

02:58:05.420 --> 02:58:08.420
She's the one who summoned me forth from the lamp.

02:58:08.420 --> 02:58:10.420
What are we going to do about this spirit?

02:58:10.420 --> 02:58:12.420
Why, ask for something.

02:58:12.420 --> 02:58:14.420
Ask for something you've always wanted.

02:58:14.420 --> 02:58:16.420
Uh, let's see.

02:58:16.420 --> 02:58:17.420
A pearl necklace.

02:58:17.420 --> 02:58:20.420
So it may your wishes, my command.

02:58:21.420 --> 02:58:23.420
Hey, wait a minute.

02:58:23.420 --> 02:58:27.420
Oh, a pearl necklace is only one of the things I wanted.

02:58:27.420 --> 02:58:28.420
I hadn't decided yet.

02:58:28.420 --> 02:58:30.420
Don't worry, Snork Maiden.

02:58:30.420 --> 02:58:32.420
I guess you can always send it back.

02:58:32.420 --> 02:58:35.420
If I like the necklace, then it's your turn to rub the lamp.

02:58:35.420 --> 02:58:38.420
Then you can wish for whatever you've always wanted.

02:58:38.420 --> 02:58:39.420
Yes.

02:58:39.420 --> 02:58:42.420
But where exactly did you rub the lamp?

02:58:42.420 --> 02:58:44.420
Right here, and very, very slowly.

02:58:44.420 --> 02:58:45.420
All right.

02:58:45.420 --> 02:58:47.420
I'll say spirit come forth.

02:58:47.420 --> 02:58:50.420
It sounds a little better than come out, spirit.

02:58:50.420 --> 02:58:59.420
Oh, that was loud.

02:58:59.420 --> 02:59:05.420
Oh, he's back.

02:59:05.420 --> 02:59:07.420
One oil necklace, Miss.

02:59:07.420 --> 02:59:08.420
Thanks.

02:59:08.420 --> 02:59:10.420
This is incredible.

02:59:10.420 --> 02:59:11.420
Right.

02:59:11.420 --> 02:59:14.420
I do think this is exactly what I wanted.

02:59:14.420 --> 02:59:16.420
Oh, thank you ever so much.

02:59:16.420 --> 02:59:18.420
All in a day's wake.

02:59:18.420 --> 02:59:22.420
So pleased to oblige, Miss.

02:59:22.420 --> 02:59:24.420
Are you going back into the lamp?

02:59:24.420 --> 02:59:25.420
Yes, I am.

02:59:25.420 --> 02:59:26.420
I'm so happy.

02:59:26.420 --> 02:59:29.420
Now, it's my turn to let you out of here.

02:59:29.420 --> 02:59:32.420
I'd like to have a wish granted, too, please.

02:59:32.420 --> 02:59:33.420
Now, wait a minute.

02:59:33.420 --> 02:59:38.420
If getting in and out is a bother, why don't you let me give you my wish right now?

02:59:38.420 --> 02:59:40.420
Can't do it, young man.

02:59:40.420 --> 02:59:42.420
One at a time in the face to call.

02:59:42.420 --> 02:59:44.420
Just wanted to save time.

02:59:44.420 --> 02:59:45.420
Impossible, young say.

02:59:45.420 --> 02:59:46.420
But why?

02:59:46.420 --> 02:59:50.420
Because I am only able to fulfill one wish a week.

02:59:50.420 --> 02:59:51.420
I need my rest.

02:59:51.420 --> 02:59:53.420
It's hard working, though.

02:59:53.420 --> 02:59:55.420
Oh, well, of course it's tiring.

02:59:55.420 --> 02:59:57.420
Perhaps I expected too much from you.

02:59:57.420 --> 02:59:58.420
Hold on.

02:59:58.420 --> 03:00:01.420
I wouldn't like you to think that I haven't got the power.

03:00:01.420 --> 03:00:03.420
I can do many extraordinary things.

03:00:03.420 --> 03:00:04.420
What kind of things?

03:00:04.420 --> 03:00:05.420
Not telling you.

03:00:12.420 --> 03:00:13.420
Listen, moment.

03:00:13.420 --> 03:00:15.420
We won't tell a soul about this lamp, all right?

03:00:15.420 --> 03:00:16.420
Of course not.

03:00:24.420 --> 03:00:25.420
No.

03:00:38.420 --> 03:00:40.420
No, names don't really matter.

03:00:40.420 --> 03:00:44.420
Tulip, hydranger, who cares?

03:00:44.420 --> 03:00:46.420
No, that's not right somehow.

03:00:46.420 --> 03:00:48.420
I'm a geranium of ox glove.

03:00:48.420 --> 03:00:50.420
Oh, I'm so tired.

03:00:53.420 --> 03:00:56.040
H.L.D View

03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:17.800
Hmm.

03:01:19.300 --> 03:01:22.280
Praise the lad and I didn't tell them I can get out at night.

03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:26.520
I'd have no peace at all. My leisure time would be totally ruined by these two

03:01:27.400 --> 03:01:33.260
Good thing also I can read their minds, so I know what I'm up against. They're up to something I know they are

03:01:44.780 --> 03:01:49.760
Oh, yes, dear me dear me no one did the young man is worried to death

03:01:50.760 --> 03:01:53.440
She wish I better rewrite this. Oh

03:01:54.760 --> 03:01:57.920
Edgur Edgur, I do wish you was somebody else

03:01:58.600 --> 03:02:02.840
This will certainly have to be changed the whole page really

03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:25.520
What's going on here? Who did this? Mom, not you surely what some

03:02:25.520 --> 03:02:32.000
Rascals been rewriting my play. Who could that possibly be who indeed in the middle of the night while I was asleep

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:41.080
It's very strange, isn't it Papa? It can't be you moment, can't it? Of course not Papa. I am upset. Who can it be?

03:02:41.840 --> 03:02:46.280
Imagine going into your study while you were fast asleep. It's very rude, isn't it?

03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:49.360
I find it incredible that anyone could do such a thing

03:02:49.880 --> 03:02:54.040
And all the rewriting was done on those bits that I knew weren't perfectly polished

03:02:54.600 --> 03:02:57.880
Listen dear. I'm sure they were far too good for him to improve on

03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:04.040
No, no, you're wrong. That's the worst thing. I must admit he did improve them

03:03:04.240 --> 03:03:06.560
Then I think you should feel pleased dear

03:03:07.080 --> 03:03:12.120
Yeah, no, I'm not a bit pleased and parameter should write his own plays

03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:16.680
Looks great snorkemaiden that is if you like necklaces

03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:19.560
Thank you little my it was given to me as a present

03:03:20.320 --> 03:03:25.440
Rather nice would you mind if I tried it on for a minute? Of course not. I'm sure you'll look gorgeous

03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:32.320
I suppose in time one could get to like necklaces. I could ask for similar one for you

03:03:33.720 --> 03:03:35.720
Deepers who's your rich friend

03:03:36.440 --> 03:03:40.840
Yes, I search the whole house, but I can't find it anywhere

03:03:41.320 --> 03:03:47.480
Someone must have stolen it. Don't worry Mrs. Philly-Johnk. I fully expect to arrest the thief any minute now

03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:55.320
Good afternoon inspector. Hello, snorkemaiden. Please hurry inspector. The thief is almost certainly let movement valley already

03:03:55.440 --> 03:04:01.000
Oh dear. Oh dear. Nothing is safe in this valley anymore. Now calm down Mrs. Philly-Johnk

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:05.600
Did you just say you've had something stolen Mrs. Philly-Johnk my pearl necklace?

03:04:06.080 --> 03:04:11.440
Extraordinarily beautiful pearls eighty-seven of them looks just like the one you're wearing little my

03:04:12.200 --> 03:04:14.200
You stole it

03:04:15.640 --> 03:04:17.640
Did you

03:04:17.640 --> 03:04:19.640
Oh

03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:21.640
What are you doing?

03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:26.640
She's innocent

03:04:32.640 --> 03:04:34.640
Snorkemaiden's necklace

03:04:37.640 --> 03:04:42.480
The best explanation you can think of no one calls little my a thief and gets away with it

03:04:42.840 --> 03:04:50.360
Is it really true that this is your necklace snorkemaiden? Of course inspector. It was a present. I swear it who gave it to you

03:04:50.360 --> 03:04:53.760
That's a secret between me and movement a secret

03:04:54.200 --> 03:04:59.720
That's a lie. They stole it inspector. I've never known them to lie before Mrs. Philly-Johnk

03:04:59.720 --> 03:05:02.360
From a very bad background you should see their home

03:05:02.360 --> 03:05:04.360
So

03:05:09.960 --> 03:05:11.960
Something I want to ask you

03:05:32.480 --> 03:05:34.480
I love to know

03:05:38.480 --> 03:05:40.480
Listen to this. This is a good example

03:05:41.120 --> 03:05:44.600
Hey look at the sky the sun's up and there's Gracie

03:05:45.320 --> 03:05:47.320
That's not great sounds very ordinary

03:05:48.320 --> 03:05:51.480
That's what I wrote snuffkin. Oh, I'm so sorry

03:05:52.160 --> 03:05:55.200
That's all right now listen to how he rewrote it

03:05:55.720 --> 03:06:02.720
But soft what light through yonder window breaks it is the east and juliet is the sun a rise

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:08.120
Verson and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief

03:06:09.120 --> 03:06:14.840
What a sunrise and not how clever this writer is to change a name from Gracie to juliet

03:06:16.200 --> 03:06:19.440
Gracie's worried because appearance don't approve of her love Edgar

03:06:19.440 --> 03:06:25.080
I had his names don't matter tulip. I'd rangers who cares but listen to this

03:06:25.560 --> 03:06:32.840
What's in a name that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet much more romantic

03:06:35.400 --> 03:06:40.440
Not a Romeo called oh, it's simply great except maybe I wouldn't have mentioned his smell

03:06:40.880 --> 03:06:43.160
Don't you agree is an excellent playwright?

03:06:44.640 --> 03:06:51.640
Yes, I agree he sounds like a very promising playwright and then wordy perhaps but really good very good indeed

03:06:52.440 --> 03:06:56.800
Write him a note asking him to carry on and there might not be necessary

03:06:56.800 --> 03:07:04.840
You know all the changes were made in the middle of the night while I was fast asleep and usually writers are in their beds none of their desks when they're asleep

03:07:06.600 --> 03:07:11.440
Well, yes, that's the only time you're not at your desk isn't it but there are people

03:07:11.440 --> 03:07:16.720
You know who walk about at night without remembering about it the next morning sleepwalkers

03:07:16.720 --> 03:07:21.480
You mean now I come to think of it you were rather sleepy when you woke up this morning

03:07:21.640 --> 03:07:30.760
You're right mum and mama even sleepier than usual just so you mean you yourself got up at night and then went and rewrote the play and you're sleep

03:07:31.360 --> 03:07:36.160
Well, yes, I have been worried about some minor things in my play

03:07:36.720 --> 03:07:41.480
So my subconsciousness fairly rich in literary talent as we all know

03:07:41.720 --> 03:07:47.000
Comes to the rescue a moment papa and in my sleep my imagination runs riot

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:54.840
I have all sorts of good ideas that make me grab a pen in the middle of the night and rush to my room to let the real skill through

03:07:57.360 --> 03:07:59.360
Got it

03:07:59.360 --> 03:08:03.800
I got it with this I can have anything I can do anything

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:32.360
I know why you're running you stole that thing in you I know it's true

03:08:36.200 --> 03:08:38.200
But it must be somebody so

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000
Like

03:09:00.840 --> 03:09:02.840
Like

03:09:02.840 --> 03:09:04.840
Did you hear that enough here?

03:09:05.160 --> 03:09:07.160
You said magic lamp or something

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:46.280
You're the spirit of the lamp aren't you? Yes, my master. What is your wish? You his master? Yes, me

03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:53.880
I'm the master I let him out so he'll do what I say I don't believe a word of this fairy tales on true

03:09:54.520 --> 03:10:01.000
Maybe it isn't true, but it works. I saw snork maiden wishing for a pearl necklace and her wish was granted

03:10:01.640 --> 03:10:06.200
Uh-huh, so you're responsible. Yeah, and I brought it right away

03:10:06.840 --> 03:10:08.840
God now let me see

03:10:09.080 --> 03:10:11.320
What do I want more than anything in the world?

03:10:11.640 --> 03:10:16.040
Stinky he can only make one wish a week come true. You'll have to wait your turn

03:10:16.520 --> 03:10:18.520
No, that's very unfair

03:10:19.480 --> 03:10:25.560
Let's get back to the necklace where did you steal it from mr. I don't steal well then tell me where you found it

03:10:26.600 --> 03:10:35.560
Around here somewhere. Mrs. Philly Johns house, maybe I don't know who lives there. Oh, then you did steal the necklace. Well, that's a lot easier, you know

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:40.600
How about a magic key that can open anything bolts and safes and stuff huh?

03:10:41.320 --> 03:10:47.560
Listen, there's something I'd like to ask you a sack of gold wouldn't be half as much fun as a key that opens anything

03:10:47.960 --> 03:10:54.920
Tell me is it possible that you rewrote woman poppers play? Yes, I did. It was really awful. Oh come on

03:10:55.320 --> 03:11:02.360
I just needed some polishing and what's more? See this young man standing here? Well, he was really worried about your play

03:11:02.360 --> 03:11:04.360
You know, I was just trying to help

03:11:04.760 --> 03:11:06.760
Is this true

03:11:06.840 --> 03:11:13.560
Saver the mercury of course, but then there's professional pride to think of I can explain papa

03:11:13.560 --> 03:11:17.400
I saw you weren't happy about your play and I wanted it to be a big success

03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:22.920
Of course, I didn't want the spirit to write it himself. I'm gonna take the key

03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:27.160
Yeah, I've just realized everybody the spirit didn't write all that himself

03:11:27.720 --> 03:11:30.520
I've heard it before I thought it sounded familiar

03:11:30.760 --> 03:11:32.760
There's that soul

03:11:32.760 --> 03:11:37.800
Yes, he stole it from a play by somebody else this spirit is a cheat and a liar

03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:40.840
Oh, dear me

03:11:41.080 --> 03:11:44.280
Well, I can't help being so well read can I go back in the lamp now?

03:11:48.520 --> 03:11:52.440
Sorry, master can't oblige have been put into an impossible situation

03:11:52.840 --> 03:11:54.840
See you next week

03:11:58.040 --> 03:12:02.840
But that's ridiculous not next week nor next month or even next year

03:12:03.320 --> 03:12:10.040
Stinky this lamp is not yours besides I know exactly the sort of thing you'd ask for a master key or something

03:12:11.400 --> 03:12:17.160
Ha, you think you can hide that magic lamp from me, do you? Well, there's no hiding place good enough for that

03:12:17.880 --> 03:12:19.880
Hmm

03:12:19.880 --> 03:12:23.880
Well, then I really do think that lamp is a bit too dangerous to have a rod

03:12:24.440 --> 03:12:26.440
Hmm, I think you're right

03:12:26.840 --> 03:12:29.400
Snuffkin, do you have any good ideas for us?

03:12:29.400 --> 03:12:31.400
I

03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:45.400
Week is passed so we can summon the spirit again

03:12:55.320 --> 03:12:57.320
There's the inspector

03:13:00.120 --> 03:13:04.600
You do it snuffkin cold the spirit

03:13:13.640 --> 03:13:16.200
Oh, no, not again. What do you want this time?

03:13:16.920 --> 03:13:21.880
Can you bring the hobgoblin here? I suppose so I'll be back as soon as I can

03:13:29.800 --> 03:13:31.800
But why an earth do you want the hobgoblin?

03:13:33.560 --> 03:13:37.880
As far as I can see there's only one safe place for the lamp where no one can find it

03:13:38.680 --> 03:13:42.440
And that's on another planet and the only one who can put it there is the hobgoblin

03:13:43.480 --> 03:13:48.120
He's coming any minute. Geez that guy ever hard to find thank you

03:13:48.520 --> 03:13:51.720
I've done my wake for this week. See you next week goodbye

03:13:59.960 --> 03:14:01.960
Oh

03:14:11.240 --> 03:14:18.360
And some of the hobgoblin took the magic ramp away and headed on some unknown planet and a good thing too

03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:23.240
It would really be very boring if all your wishes were granted wouldn't it

03:14:24.200 --> 03:14:26.200
You

03:14:26.600 --> 03:14:31.560
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements

03:14:33.640 --> 03:14:38.920
We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

03:14:41.240 --> 03:14:48.520
They're always happy and goes at play the moments are having fun day after day the

03:14:48.520 --> 03:14:50.520
movements

03:14:52.040 --> 03:14:54.040
The

03:15:01.560 --> 03:15:03.560
No

03:15:18.520 --> 03:15:32.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here

03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:42.240
with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements, so come

03:15:42.240 --> 03:15:49.440
with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like

03:15:49.440 --> 03:15:58.960
a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements, there

03:15:58.960 --> 03:16:08.840
were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

03:16:09.480 --> 03:16:15.880
The movements and movements were about to come.

03:16:15.880 --> 03:16:39.880
Winter was just around the corner, and that was the time of year for movement to get

03:16:39.880 --> 03:16:54.040
restless. Because this was the time of year for snuffkin to leave

03:16:54.040 --> 03:17:12.040
movement valley on his yearly trek south.

03:17:12.040 --> 03:17:15.040
Good morning, Papa. That bonfire looks inviting.

03:17:15.040 --> 03:17:18.040
No, you're up already.

03:17:18.040 --> 03:17:22.040
I'm scared and leaves this morning after that wind last night.

03:17:22.040 --> 03:17:27.040
Yes, winders on the way. Oh, this is a lovely bonfire.

03:17:27.040 --> 03:17:30.040
Yes, isn't it?

03:17:30.040 --> 03:17:34.040
I guess we're hibernating again this winter. Are we moving, Papa?

03:17:34.040 --> 03:17:38.040
Well, of course. We always hibernate in the winter.

03:17:38.040 --> 03:17:44.040
If snuffkin says I could go with him, couldn't I give this winter a miss and hibernate longer next year?

03:17:45.040 --> 03:17:47.040
Oh, please, movement, Papa.

03:17:47.040 --> 03:17:50.040
Snuffkin would rather go alone, I think, movement.

03:17:50.040 --> 03:17:53.040
Would I might get him to train his mind?

03:17:53.040 --> 03:17:57.040
That snuffkin's not really a person who likes to be pressed.

03:17:57.040 --> 03:17:58.040
Why not?

03:17:58.040 --> 03:18:05.040
Well, he's a very solitary person. His winter trip is the only time he can really be alone for a while.

03:18:05.040 --> 03:18:08.040
I know, but I was just hoping.

03:18:08.040 --> 03:18:11.040
Snuffkin likes you very much. I know that.

03:18:12.040 --> 03:18:16.040
And I think that's why he stays in movement valley for the rest of the year.

03:18:16.040 --> 03:18:21.040
But at heart, he's a vagabond and he needs time away from us.

03:18:21.040 --> 03:18:24.040
He's not a family man, so he's free to do as he wants.

03:18:24.040 --> 03:18:27.040
And as his friend, you should try to understand.

03:18:27.040 --> 03:18:31.040
I know you'd like to go with him, but I don't think he's such a good idea.

03:18:31.040 --> 03:18:34.040
He'd really hate to turn you down, I know.

03:18:34.040 --> 03:18:35.040
I guess.

03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:37.040
But he'd have to.

03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:43.040
Oh.

03:18:53.040 --> 03:18:56.040
Why aren't they biting?

03:18:56.040 --> 03:18:59.040
I haven't had a proper catch for days.

03:18:59.040 --> 03:19:01.040
Getting too cold, is that?

03:19:04.040 --> 03:19:06.040
When are you leaving?

03:19:06.040 --> 03:19:08.040
You're about to leave, aren't you?

03:19:08.040 --> 03:19:10.040
Yes.

03:19:12.040 --> 03:19:16.040
Could I ask you something?

03:19:16.040 --> 03:19:18.040
What?

03:19:18.040 --> 03:19:20.040
Don't go without telling me.

03:19:20.040 --> 03:19:21.040
But why?

03:19:21.040 --> 03:19:26.040
I'm always sad when you leave, even though I know you'll return in the spring.

03:19:26.040 --> 03:19:29.040
Yeah. Me too, sort of.

03:19:29.040 --> 03:19:32.040
That's why this year I'd plan to leave without saying anything.

03:19:32.040 --> 03:19:36.040
But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly.

03:19:36.040 --> 03:19:38.040
I'd like to wish you good luck and all that.

03:19:38.040 --> 03:19:40.040
I miss you so much when you're away.

03:19:40.040 --> 03:19:43.040
Please, Nuffkin.

03:19:43.040 --> 03:19:45.040
Moomin, I have a better idea.

03:19:45.040 --> 03:19:47.040
I won't leave until after you've started hibernating.

03:19:47.040 --> 03:19:49.040
Then you won't miss me, will you?

03:19:49.040 --> 03:19:50.040
You're right.

03:19:50.040 --> 03:19:52.040
I'll take my right idea, Snuffkin.

03:19:52.040 --> 03:19:54.040
Then we won't really part at all, won't we?

03:19:54.040 --> 03:19:55.040
Nope.

03:19:55.040 --> 03:19:59.040
Because I promise to be back here in Moomin Valley before you've even woken up.

03:19:59.040 --> 03:20:04.040
Wonderful. What a super idea.

03:20:04.040 --> 03:20:07.040
Hey, Moomin!

03:20:07.040 --> 03:20:09.040
Oh, Snuff.

03:20:09.040 --> 03:20:11.040
Moomin, come here a minute.

03:20:11.040 --> 03:20:13.040
There's something funny caught up in a tree.

03:20:13.040 --> 03:20:15.040
What do you mean, funny?

03:20:15.040 --> 03:20:16.040
I don't know exactly.

03:20:16.040 --> 03:20:18.040
Never saw anything like it before.

03:20:18.040 --> 03:20:20.040
Snork made a little my-founded first,

03:20:20.040 --> 03:20:22.040
but it's too high to get it down.

03:20:22.040 --> 03:20:24.040
Okay, I'll come have a look.

03:20:29.040 --> 03:20:31.040
Be careful.

03:20:33.040 --> 03:20:36.040
Be careful. What is it, Moomin?

03:20:36.040 --> 03:20:41.040
I know what it is. It's a kite.

03:20:41.040 --> 03:20:44.040
Oh, what?

03:20:44.040 --> 03:20:46.040
A kite is something you find in the sky.

03:20:46.040 --> 03:20:48.040
But it has no wings.

03:20:48.040 --> 03:20:51.040
No, you send it up against the wind on a string.

03:20:58.040 --> 03:21:01.040
Just a little bit more.

03:21:07.040 --> 03:21:09.040
Wait a second.

03:21:21.040 --> 03:21:23.040
Wait a second.

03:21:25.040 --> 03:21:27.040
I'll throw it down.

03:21:27.040 --> 03:21:30.040
That's all right.

03:21:31.040 --> 03:21:34.040
Hey!

03:21:38.040 --> 03:21:41.040
Oh, song. This is what a kite looks like.

03:21:41.040 --> 03:21:43.040
Looks broken to me.

03:21:43.040 --> 03:21:46.040
I'm sure we can fix it and make it fly.

03:21:46.040 --> 03:21:47.040
Let's see.

03:21:47.040 --> 03:21:49.040
Oh, no. The string must have broken

03:21:49.040 --> 03:21:50.040
when someone was flying it

03:21:50.040 --> 03:21:52.040
and the wind blew it down into the tree.

03:21:52.040 --> 03:21:54.040
Well, why don't we repair it?

03:21:54.040 --> 03:21:55.040
Yes, let's.

03:21:55.040 --> 03:21:57.040
Looks pretty badly broken to me.

03:21:58.040 --> 03:22:01.040
Well, I don't know. We'll have to see.

03:22:04.040 --> 03:22:06.040
It is a kite, isn't it?

03:22:06.040 --> 03:22:07.040
Can we mend it?

03:22:07.040 --> 03:22:09.040
Maybe.

03:22:12.040 --> 03:22:14.040
A very odd kite?

03:22:14.040 --> 03:22:17.040
It must have come from far away.

03:22:17.040 --> 03:22:19.040
You think it can be repaired?

03:22:19.040 --> 03:22:20.040
Of course.

03:22:20.040 --> 03:22:21.040
Well, come on, then.

03:22:21.040 --> 03:22:23.040
Snork will help you repair it.

03:22:23.040 --> 03:22:25.040
I can repair it without your help

03:22:25.040 --> 03:22:28.040
as long as you can find us some really long string,

03:22:28.040 --> 03:22:31.040
strong but not too thick of possible.

03:22:31.040 --> 03:22:34.040
I think I have what you need, some string.

03:22:34.040 --> 03:22:38.040
Good. Excellent. I'll start immediately.

03:22:56.040 --> 03:22:57.040
Good.

03:22:57.040 --> 03:22:58.040
Good.

03:22:58.040 --> 03:22:59.040
Good.

03:22:59.040 --> 03:23:00.040
Good.

03:23:00.040 --> 03:23:01.040
Good.

03:23:01.040 --> 03:23:02.040
Good.

03:23:02.040 --> 03:23:03.040
Good.

03:23:03.040 --> 03:23:04.040
Good.

03:23:04.040 --> 03:23:05.040
Good.

03:23:05.040 --> 03:23:06.040
Good.

03:23:06.040 --> 03:23:07.040
Good.

03:23:07.040 --> 03:23:08.040
Good.

03:23:08.040 --> 03:23:09.040
Good.

03:23:09.040 --> 03:23:10.040
Good.

03:23:10.040 --> 03:23:11.040
Good.

03:23:11.040 --> 03:23:12.040
Good.

03:23:12.040 --> 03:23:13.040
Good.

03:23:13.040 --> 03:23:14.040
Good.

03:23:14.040 --> 03:23:15.040
Good.

03:23:15.040 --> 03:23:16.040
Good.

03:23:16.040 --> 03:23:17.040
Good.

03:23:17.040 --> 03:23:18.040
Good.

03:23:18.040 --> 03:23:19.040
Good.

03:23:19.040 --> 03:23:20.040
Good.

03:23:20.040 --> 03:23:21.040
Good.

03:23:21.040 --> 03:23:22.040
Good.

03:23:22.040 --> 03:23:23.040
Good.

03:23:23.040 --> 03:23:24.040
Good.

03:23:24.040 --> 03:23:25.040
Good.

03:23:25.040 --> 03:23:26.040
Good.

03:23:26.040 --> 03:23:27.040
Good.

03:23:27.040 --> 03:23:28.040
Good.

03:23:28.040 --> 03:23:29.040
Good.

03:23:29.040 --> 03:23:30.040
Good.

03:23:30.040 --> 03:23:31.040
Good.

03:23:31.040 --> 03:23:32.040
Good.

03:23:32.040 --> 03:23:33.040
Good.

03:23:33.040 --> 03:23:34.040
Good.

03:23:34.040 --> 03:23:35.040
Good.

03:23:35.040 --> 03:23:36.040
Good.

03:23:36.040 --> 03:23:37.040
Good.

03:23:37.040 --> 03:23:38.040
Good.

03:23:38.040 --> 03:23:39.040
Good.

03:23:39.040 --> 03:23:44.040
This is a really exciting project I haven't flown a kite for years.

03:23:44.040 --> 03:23:47.040
I do hope that string is long enough.

03:23:47.040 --> 03:23:49.040
Snork, is this okay?

03:23:49.040 --> 03:23:50.040
Fine.

03:23:50.040 --> 03:23:51.040
Who's going to fly it?

03:23:51.040 --> 03:23:52.040
I'll do it.

03:23:52.040 --> 03:23:54.040
Okay, sniff.

03:23:54.040 --> 03:23:55.040
Moving.

03:23:55.040 --> 03:23:56.040
Hold the kite up high.

03:23:56.040 --> 03:23:57.040
Like this.

03:23:57.040 --> 03:23:58.040
Hmm.

03:23:58.040 --> 03:23:59.040
All right, sniff.

03:23:59.040 --> 03:24:00.040
Are you ready?

03:24:00.040 --> 03:24:01.040
Yeah.

03:24:01.040 --> 03:24:02.040
I'm ready.

03:24:02.040 --> 03:24:03.040
Don't let go.

03:24:03.040 --> 03:24:04.040
Do I say win?

03:24:04.040 --> 03:24:05.040
Hmm.

03:24:05.040 --> 03:24:06.040
Win, moment.

03:24:06.040 --> 03:24:07.040
Oh.

03:24:07.040 --> 03:24:08.040
Oh.

03:24:08.040 --> 03:24:09.040
Oh.

03:24:09.040 --> 03:24:10.040
It's falling.

03:24:10.040 --> 03:24:11.040
Oh.

03:24:11.040 --> 03:24:12.040
Oh.

03:24:12.040 --> 03:24:13.040
Oh.

03:24:13.040 --> 03:24:14.040
Oh.

03:24:14.040 --> 03:24:15.040
Oh.

03:24:15.040 --> 03:24:16.040
It's falling.

03:24:16.040 --> 03:24:17.040
Oh.

03:24:17.040 --> 03:24:18.040
Oh.

03:24:18.040 --> 03:24:19.040
It's falling.

03:24:19.040 --> 03:24:20.040
Try again.

03:24:20.040 --> 03:24:23.040
And this time, start running them when the wind catches the kite.

03:24:23.040 --> 03:24:25.040
You start paying out the light.

03:24:25.040 --> 03:24:26.040
All right.

03:24:26.040 --> 03:24:27.040
Fine.

03:24:27.040 --> 03:24:28.040
Hold it up again, moment.

03:24:28.040 --> 03:24:29.040
Right.

03:24:29.040 --> 03:24:30.040
Ready?

03:24:30.040 --> 03:24:31.040
Yeah.

03:24:31.040 --> 03:24:32.040
I'm ready.

03:24:32.040 --> 03:24:34.040
Let go of it.

03:24:34.040 --> 03:24:36.040
Easy going up yet.

03:24:36.040 --> 03:24:40.040
No, it isn't.

03:24:40.040 --> 03:24:42.040
Stop, sniff.

03:24:42.040 --> 03:24:44.040
You're breaking the kite.

03:24:44.040 --> 03:24:45.040
Hmm.

03:24:45.040 --> 03:24:48.040
I don't think this kite's any good for anybody.

03:24:48.040 --> 03:24:50.040
The kite's fine.

03:24:50.040 --> 03:24:52.040
It's just that the wind is too weak.

03:24:52.040 --> 03:24:53.040
All right.

03:24:53.040 --> 03:24:55.040
We'll have to wait for it to get stronger.

03:24:55.040 --> 03:24:58.040
Pretty though, we certainly had a good strong wind yesterday.

03:24:58.040 --> 03:25:00.040
Is it okay?

03:25:00.040 --> 03:25:01.040
Hmm.

03:25:01.040 --> 03:25:04.040
I think the wind is getting stronger, moment.

03:25:16.040 --> 03:25:17.040
Oh.

03:25:21.040 --> 03:25:22.040
There it goes.

03:25:29.040 --> 03:25:31.040
Let me hold the string, moment.

03:25:34.040 --> 03:25:36.040
Boy, this wind is really strong.

03:25:36.040 --> 03:25:38.040
Can I let out the string now?

03:25:38.040 --> 03:25:39.040
Do it slowly, mind.

03:25:39.040 --> 03:25:40.040
All right.

03:25:41.040 --> 03:25:43.040
Let me do it.

03:25:43.040 --> 03:25:44.040
Snip, come on.

03:25:44.040 --> 03:25:45.040
It's my turn.

03:25:45.040 --> 03:25:46.040
Let me break your kiln, little lion.

03:25:46.040 --> 03:25:47.040
Why not?

03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:49.040
Because you don't weigh enough to hold it.

03:25:49.040 --> 03:25:50.040
I'm very strong.

03:25:50.040 --> 03:25:51.040
The wind is quite dry.

03:25:51.040 --> 03:25:52.040
You go up with it.

03:26:04.040 --> 03:26:05.040
You have more sniff.

03:26:05.040 --> 03:26:06.040
Yes, Papa?

03:26:06.040 --> 03:26:08.040
It is better to hold it for a while.

03:26:09.040 --> 03:26:11.040
Well, yes, you'd like it.

03:26:11.040 --> 03:26:13.040
Hold it really tight, then.

03:26:18.040 --> 03:26:19.040
All right.

03:26:19.040 --> 03:26:21.040
I could do this long before it was born.

03:26:22.040 --> 03:26:23.040
Oops.

03:26:26.040 --> 03:26:27.040
What's happening?

03:26:29.040 --> 03:26:31.040
Papa, why did you drop quickly?

03:26:31.040 --> 03:26:34.040
And I'm winding, I'm winding.

03:26:35.040 --> 03:26:37.040
Faster, oh, wind it faster.

03:26:48.040 --> 03:26:50.040
That was definitely not my fault.

03:26:50.040 --> 03:26:52.040
Of course it wasn't.

03:26:52.040 --> 03:26:54.040
With such a strong wind up there,

03:26:54.040 --> 03:26:57.040
I think we have to lower the centre of gravity a bit.

03:27:00.040 --> 03:27:02.040
The kite's all right, Papa.

03:27:03.040 --> 03:27:05.040
Hmm, maybe it would take me with it.

03:27:20.040 --> 03:27:21.040
That's it.

03:27:21.040 --> 03:27:24.040
I suppose that's to stop it from spinning around.

03:27:24.040 --> 03:27:25.040
Is it snorke?

03:27:25.040 --> 03:27:26.040
Yes, that's right.

03:27:33.040 --> 03:27:35.040
What is it?

03:27:37.040 --> 03:27:39.040
Listen, I'm going to ride that kite.

03:27:39.040 --> 03:27:41.040
What did you say?

03:27:41.040 --> 03:27:44.040
I think it's going to be okay now.

03:27:44.040 --> 03:27:46.040
If I hold on really tight,

03:27:46.040 --> 03:27:49.040
I think I could have a wonderful ride on that kite.

03:27:49.040 --> 03:27:51.040
Yes, maybe it'd be wonderful while you're up in the sky,

03:27:51.040 --> 03:27:54.040
but you've seen how fast it can come down again.

03:27:54.040 --> 03:27:57.040
But the snorke just said it won't fall down again.

03:27:57.040 --> 03:27:58.040
Even so.

03:27:58.040 --> 03:28:00.040
I'm going to do it.

03:28:00.040 --> 03:28:01.040
But no one must see me,

03:28:01.040 --> 03:28:04.040
or they might try to stop me if they guess what I'm up to.

03:28:04.040 --> 03:28:06.040
Oh, please don't do it.

03:28:06.040 --> 03:28:08.040
What are you doing?

03:28:08.040 --> 03:28:09.040
Listen carefully.

03:28:09.040 --> 03:28:10.040
Yes.

03:28:11.040 --> 03:28:14.040
When we fly the kite next time.

03:28:14.040 --> 03:28:15.040
Huh?

03:28:15.040 --> 03:28:18.040
What are you two whispering about?

03:28:18.040 --> 03:28:19.040
We weren't snorke-made,

03:28:19.040 --> 03:28:23.040
and I was just saying to sniff that the kite wouldn't fall down again.

03:28:23.040 --> 03:28:25.040
It won't, snorke is fixed it.

03:28:25.040 --> 03:28:27.040
But you can't be absolutely sure.

03:28:27.040 --> 03:28:29.040
And you'll be holding the kite won't you sniff?

03:28:29.040 --> 03:28:32.040
Now then, do you want to do it, moving?

03:28:32.040 --> 03:28:33.040
Yes.

03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:35.040
And this time I'll let out all the line.

03:28:35.040 --> 03:28:38.040
And sniff, you could hold it up, okay?

03:28:38.040 --> 03:28:40.040
Yes, that's fine.

03:28:40.040 --> 03:28:41.040
No.

03:28:41.040 --> 03:28:43.040
I'm counting on you, sniff.

03:28:43.040 --> 03:28:45.040
And so am I, sniff?

03:28:45.040 --> 03:28:46.040
Hmm.

03:28:55.040 --> 03:28:57.040
Are you sure you'll be all right?

03:28:57.040 --> 03:28:58.040
Of course I will, silly.

03:28:58.040 --> 03:29:00.040
Well, I'm not so sure.

03:29:00.040 --> 03:29:02.040
Why don't you keep your eyes closed then?

03:29:02.040 --> 03:29:03.040
Good idea.

03:29:05.040 --> 03:29:06.040
Okay, sniff.

03:29:06.040 --> 03:29:08.040
Let go of it when I say ready.

03:29:08.040 --> 03:29:09.040
Hi.

03:29:14.040 --> 03:29:15.040
Ready.

03:29:28.040 --> 03:29:30.040
Hi.

03:29:30.040 --> 03:29:32.040
Hi.

03:29:32.040 --> 03:29:34.040
Hi.

03:29:34.040 --> 03:29:36.040
Hi.

03:29:36.040 --> 03:29:38.040
Hi.

03:29:38.040 --> 03:29:40.040
Hi.

03:29:46.040 --> 03:29:48.040
Hi.

03:29:48.040 --> 03:29:50.040
Hi.

03:29:50.040 --> 03:29:52.040
Hi.

03:29:52.040 --> 03:29:54.040
Hi.

03:29:54.040 --> 03:29:55.040
That's it.

03:29:55.040 --> 03:29:56.040
That's all of the line.

03:29:56.040 --> 03:29:58.040
It's very high.

03:29:58.040 --> 03:30:00.040
Must be some wind up there.

03:30:00.040 --> 03:30:02.040
It's flying really well, isn't it?

03:30:02.040 --> 03:30:04.040
Certainly is.

03:30:04.040 --> 03:30:06.040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:30:06.040 --> 03:30:08.040
This is getting bumpy.

03:30:08.040 --> 03:30:10.040
Oh!

03:30:10.040 --> 03:30:14.040
What's that?

03:30:14.040 --> 03:30:17.040
Let's see if there's something very strange happening on that kite.

03:30:17.040 --> 03:30:19.040
What is it?

03:30:19.040 --> 03:30:21.040
I can't see properly from here.

03:30:21.040 --> 03:30:23.040
I saw something.

03:30:23.040 --> 03:30:25.040
Could it be a bird, maybe?

03:30:25.040 --> 03:30:27.040
The kite is turned again.

03:30:27.040 --> 03:30:29.040
But it wasn't a bird.

03:30:29.040 --> 03:30:31.040
Or a twig or something, then.

03:30:31.040 --> 03:30:33.040
I doubt it.

03:30:33.040 --> 03:30:35.040
Don't you see the back of the kite from where you are, sniff?

03:30:35.040 --> 03:30:37.040
No, Mom and Mama, because my eyes are closed.

03:30:37.040 --> 03:30:39.040
Oh.

03:30:39.040 --> 03:30:41.040
I think I know who it is.

03:30:41.040 --> 03:30:43.040
Little Mai.

03:30:43.040 --> 03:30:45.040
What?

03:30:45.040 --> 03:30:49.040
No, I haven't seen one of my four.

03:30:49.040 --> 03:30:51.040
She seems to have disappeared.

03:30:51.040 --> 03:30:53.040
Don't ask me anything.

03:30:53.040 --> 03:30:55.040
Sniff, what do you mean?

03:30:55.040 --> 03:30:57.040
No, she was dead set on riding the kite.

03:30:57.040 --> 03:30:59.040
I couldn't stop her.

03:30:59.040 --> 03:31:01.040
What?

03:31:01.040 --> 03:31:03.040
Moment, bring it down very slowly.

03:31:03.040 --> 03:31:05.040
Huh?

03:31:13.040 --> 03:31:15.040
Take it easy, Moment. That wind is strong.

03:31:15.040 --> 03:31:17.040
It could break the line.

03:31:19.040 --> 03:31:21.040
But that was what it planned last best stream.

03:31:21.040 --> 03:31:23.040
It's the knot I wore in the board knot.

03:31:23.040 --> 03:31:29.040
The one between our line and the bit that was still hanging from the kite when we found it.

03:31:29.040 --> 03:31:33.040
The line is fine, if the knot is another one.

03:31:39.040 --> 03:31:41.040
Oh my God.

03:31:41.040 --> 03:31:43.040
Oh my God.

03:31:43.040 --> 03:31:45.040
Oh my God.

03:31:45.040 --> 03:31:47.040
Oh my God.

03:31:47.040 --> 03:31:49.040
Oh my God.

03:31:49.040 --> 03:31:51.040
Oh my God.

03:31:57.040 --> 03:31:59.040
Hang on tight, little Mai.

03:31:59.040 --> 03:32:01.040
That wind is getting stronger.

03:32:03.040 --> 03:32:07.040
Oh, this is more scarier than I thought.

03:32:09.040 --> 03:32:13.040
I'll just have to hang on as best as I can.

03:32:13.040 --> 03:32:15.040
Don't move around so much.

03:32:15.040 --> 03:32:17.040
I can't help it.

03:32:17.040 --> 03:32:19.040
It's almost down.

03:32:19.040 --> 03:32:21.040
What?

03:32:21.040 --> 03:32:23.040
Oh.

03:32:23.040 --> 03:32:25.040
Oh.

03:32:25.040 --> 03:32:27.040
Oh.

03:32:27.040 --> 03:32:29.040
Oh.

03:32:29.040 --> 03:32:31.040
Oh my God.

03:32:31.040 --> 03:32:33.040
It opened.

03:32:33.040 --> 03:32:35.040
Come on.

03:32:35.040 --> 03:32:37.040
Sniff, get up.

03:32:37.040 --> 03:32:39.040
All right.

03:32:39.040 --> 03:32:41.040
Sniff, pull yourself together.

03:32:41.040 --> 03:32:43.040
Yes, all right.

03:32:43.040 --> 03:32:45.040
She's being blown away towards lonely mountains.

03:32:45.040 --> 03:32:47.040
Mama.

03:32:47.040 --> 03:32:49.040
Oh.

03:32:49.040 --> 03:32:51.040
I do hope little Mai really is indestructible.

03:33:03.040 --> 03:33:07.040
Where in the world is this kite taking me?

03:33:07.040 --> 03:33:09.040
All lonely mountains.

03:33:09.040 --> 03:33:11.040
I'm a long way from home.

03:33:11.040 --> 03:33:13.040
I'm a long way from home.

03:33:13.040 --> 03:33:15.040
Little Mai.

03:33:15.040 --> 03:33:17.040
Little Mai.

03:33:17.040 --> 03:33:19.040
And now she's going towards the forest of witches.

03:33:19.040 --> 03:33:23.040
She'll be all right if she fell into a tree when she...

03:33:23.040 --> 03:33:25.040
I can't see her.

03:33:25.040 --> 03:33:27.040
There's no sign of her.

03:33:27.040 --> 03:33:29.040
Well, I'm almost sure she was heading this way.

03:33:33.040 --> 03:33:35.040
What is it, Sniff?

03:33:35.040 --> 03:33:37.040
Imagine she might have fallen somewhere.

03:33:37.040 --> 03:33:39.040
She might be lying there waiting for help.

03:33:39.040 --> 03:33:41.040
Oh, stop imagining things, Sniff.

03:33:41.040 --> 03:33:43.040
She's still up there.

03:33:43.040 --> 03:33:45.040
I'm sure of it.

03:33:45.040 --> 03:33:47.040
Huh?

03:33:47.040 --> 03:33:49.040
What is it, Papa?

03:33:49.040 --> 03:33:51.040
I saw something up there.

03:33:51.040 --> 03:33:53.040
Little Mai?

03:33:53.040 --> 03:33:55.040
No, Sniff.

03:33:55.040 --> 03:33:57.040
No, it looked more like the Harb Goblin riding his panther through the sky.

03:33:57.040 --> 03:33:59.040
Really?

03:33:59.040 --> 03:34:01.040
Did you see that?

03:34:01.040 --> 03:34:03.040
Did you?

03:34:03.040 --> 03:34:05.040
You found the Mai.

03:34:05.040 --> 03:34:07.040
No, the Harb Goblin.

03:34:07.040 --> 03:34:08.040
Then it was him.

03:34:08.040 --> 03:34:10.040
Now, Harb Goblin, we're looking for Little Mai.

03:34:10.040 --> 03:34:12.040
And all you can think of is the Harb Goblin.

03:34:22.040 --> 03:34:24.040
Oh, come on.

03:34:24.040 --> 03:34:26.040
I won't you come in.

03:34:38.040 --> 03:34:40.040
Stop!

03:34:40.040 --> 03:34:42.040
Stop it!

03:34:42.040 --> 03:34:44.040
Stop it!

03:34:44.040 --> 03:34:46.040
Let's go right here!

03:34:46.040 --> 03:34:48.040
Stop!

03:34:58.040 --> 03:35:00.040
Where could she be?

03:35:00.040 --> 03:35:02.040
This is no good.

03:35:02.040 --> 03:35:06.040
We'll never find her wondering about like this.

03:35:06.040 --> 03:35:08.040
Moomin, over here.

03:35:08.040 --> 03:35:10.040
You found her?

03:35:14.040 --> 03:35:16.040
There she is.

03:35:22.040 --> 03:35:24.040
Try to cheer up, Snork Maiden.

03:35:24.040 --> 03:35:26.040
I'll try.

03:35:26.040 --> 03:35:28.040
Don't worry, Snork Maiden.

03:35:28.040 --> 03:35:30.040
Moomin, Papa, will find her for sure.

03:35:30.040 --> 03:35:32.040
Eh?

03:35:32.040 --> 03:35:36.040
Mama, Snork Maiden!

03:35:36.040 --> 03:35:38.040
I'm so glad to see you.

03:35:38.040 --> 03:35:42.040
But I just knew you'd be all right.

03:35:42.040 --> 03:35:46.040
Like Moomin Mama said, Little Mai really is indestructible.

03:35:46.040 --> 03:35:50.040
But just possibly it served her right to have her hair pulled.

03:36:02.040 --> 03:36:04.040
There's still no sign of Little Mai?

03:36:04.040 --> 03:36:06.040
No.

03:36:12.040 --> 03:36:14.040
Be careful, Moomin!

03:36:20.040 --> 03:36:22.040
Come on!

03:36:26.040 --> 03:36:28.040
Hang on, Moomin!

03:36:28.040 --> 03:36:30.040
To me, Moomin Papa!

03:36:32.040 --> 03:36:36.040
Finally, Moomin was rescued too.

03:36:36.040 --> 03:36:40.040
But he almost certainly had a fine worst scare than Little Mai.

03:36:44.040 --> 03:36:50.040
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

03:36:50.040 --> 03:36:58.040
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

03:36:58.040 --> 03:37:02.040
They're always happy and goes at play.

03:37:02.040 --> 03:37:06.040
The Moons are having fun day after day.

03:37:06.040 --> 03:37:10.040
The Moons!

03:37:10.040 --> 03:37:14.040
The Moons!

03:37:14.040 --> 03:37:18.040
The Moons!

03:37:28.040 --> 03:37:32.040
The Moons!

03:37:58.040 --> 03:38:02.040
So come with me, give me your hand.

03:38:02.040 --> 03:38:04.040
I'll take you up to Moomin Land.

03:38:04.040 --> 03:38:08.040
You can fly just like a bird.

03:38:08.040 --> 03:38:10.040
Sing that song ever.

03:38:10.040 --> 03:38:12.040
There were the Moons!

03:38:12.040 --> 03:38:16.040
There were the Moons!

03:38:16.040 --> 03:38:18.040
There were the Moons!

03:38:18.040 --> 03:38:22.040
There were the Moons!

03:38:22.040 --> 03:38:24.040
There were the Moons!

03:38:24.040 --> 03:38:28.040
There were the Moons!

03:38:42.040 --> 03:38:46.040
These days, Moomin and Snuffkin were together even more than ever.

03:38:54.040 --> 03:38:58.040
Winter would hit Moomin valley any day now.

03:38:58.040 --> 03:39:02.040
And then they would have to part.

03:39:02.040 --> 03:39:08.040
Moomin to go into hibernation and Snuffkin to leave for his trip south.

03:39:10.040 --> 03:39:14.040
Little Mai, you look sad for something upset you?

03:39:14.040 --> 03:39:16.040
Where are you off to, Moomin?

03:39:16.040 --> 03:39:18.040
To the lonely mountains.

03:39:18.040 --> 03:39:22.040
How come you two were always stealing off somewhere?

03:39:22.040 --> 03:39:24.040
We're not stealing off.

03:39:24.040 --> 03:39:26.040
We're just going for a walk to lonely mountains.

03:39:26.040 --> 03:39:28.040
Just the two of you?

03:39:28.040 --> 03:39:32.040
You're even worse than usual, never taking any of us with you.

03:39:32.040 --> 03:39:34.040
I hadn't noticed are we really doing that?

03:39:34.040 --> 03:39:36.040
I'm not sure, maybe we are.

03:39:36.040 --> 03:39:38.040
No, maybe's about it.

03:39:38.040 --> 03:39:40.040
Let me tell you, it's very rude.

03:39:40.040 --> 03:39:42.040
But we were just off for a walk.

03:39:42.040 --> 03:39:44.040
I know.

03:39:44.040 --> 03:39:46.040
Well then, why are you going?

03:39:46.040 --> 03:39:48.040
It'll start snowing any day now, little Mai,

03:39:48.040 --> 03:39:50.040
and then we won't be able to go anywhere, will we?

03:39:50.040 --> 03:39:52.040
Look at Moomin Valley from above before that happens.

03:39:52.040 --> 03:39:54.040
A likely story.

03:39:54.040 --> 03:39:56.040
But it's true, I'm off very soon,

03:39:56.040 --> 03:40:00.040
and I wanted to see it all, to give me a picture to remember while I'm walking.

03:40:00.040 --> 03:40:02.040
Hmm.

03:40:02.040 --> 03:40:04.040
Did you hear that, Snuffkin?

03:40:08.040 --> 03:40:10.040
Moomin, do you mind if we come along with you?

03:40:10.040 --> 03:40:12.040
Of course not.

03:40:12.040 --> 03:40:14.040
You see, we thought you were probably plotting something secret

03:40:14.040 --> 03:40:16.040
and weren't letting any of us in on it.

03:40:16.040 --> 03:40:18.040
Oh, come on, we don't have any secrets from you.

03:40:18.040 --> 03:40:20.040
It's just a, well, you know what I mean.

03:40:20.040 --> 03:40:22.040
Snuffkin will be leaving for months, months very soon.

03:40:22.040 --> 03:40:24.040
Never mind, off we go.

03:40:32.040 --> 03:40:36.040
It would be fun to see it all from here in the middle of winter all white.

03:40:36.040 --> 03:40:38.040
Must be very beautiful.

03:40:38.040 --> 03:40:40.040
I don't think so.

03:40:40.040 --> 03:40:42.040
With everything white and clean.

03:40:42.040 --> 03:40:44.040
In summer, it's very beautiful.

03:40:44.040 --> 03:40:46.040
Well, I'm coming back here in winter.

03:40:46.040 --> 03:40:50.040
Well, I'm coming back here in winter to see it for myself.

03:40:50.040 --> 03:40:52.040
You can't do that, you're hibernating.

03:40:52.040 --> 03:40:54.040
Well, maybe not.

03:40:54.040 --> 03:40:56.040
I thought that this year I tried to keep awake all winter.

03:40:56.040 --> 03:40:58.040
You mean just like Moomin and I did last year?

03:40:58.040 --> 03:41:00.040
Yes!

03:41:00.040 --> 03:41:02.040
You could never do it.

03:41:02.040 --> 03:41:04.040
What about you? Are you hibernating?

03:41:04.040 --> 03:41:08.040
I'm not all that mad about the snow and the cold and darks all hibernate.

03:41:10.040 --> 03:41:12.040
I'm very happy to be going home.

03:41:12.040 --> 03:41:14.040
I've seen it all now.

03:41:14.040 --> 03:41:16.040
Well, we didn't ask you to come along little life.

03:41:16.040 --> 03:41:20.040
Well, I know we go take a look at that beautiful lake against Sniff.

03:41:20.040 --> 03:41:22.040
The one with the golden fish.

03:41:22.040 --> 03:41:24.040
Oh, no, that's too far away.

03:41:24.040 --> 03:41:26.040
Ah, you're just afraid of the forest of witches, aren't you, Sniff?

03:41:26.040 --> 03:41:28.040
Not at all, I'm not a bit scared.

03:41:28.040 --> 03:41:32.040
Hey, look! Who's that?

03:41:36.040 --> 03:41:38.040
Nobody, I know.

03:41:38.040 --> 03:41:40.040
Wonder what she's doing here.

03:41:40.040 --> 03:41:42.040
Sitting down.

03:41:42.040 --> 03:41:44.040
Hello there.

03:41:44.040 --> 03:41:46.040
Right there.

03:41:46.040 --> 03:41:48.040
What are you doing up there?

03:41:48.040 --> 03:41:50.040
Ah, I'm waiting.

03:41:50.040 --> 03:41:52.040
For what? For grandma?

03:41:52.040 --> 03:41:54.040
Out here all alone.

03:41:54.040 --> 03:41:58.040
Well, grandma told me there was a big rock by the path leading up to Lonely Mountains and to wait there.

03:41:58.040 --> 03:42:02.040
But there are other rocks by the path, you know?

03:42:02.040 --> 03:42:04.040
Or there?

03:42:04.040 --> 03:42:08.040
But this is the only one I've seen so far.

03:42:08.040 --> 03:42:12.040
Your grandma must be crazy or something making you wait in a place like this.

03:42:12.040 --> 03:42:16.040
No, our house is in the forest and she's coming to show me the way.

03:42:16.040 --> 03:42:18.040
In the forest?

03:42:18.040 --> 03:42:20.040
You mean the forest of witches?

03:42:20.040 --> 03:42:22.040
Yes, I suppose so.

03:42:22.040 --> 03:42:24.040
It's not very far from here.

03:42:24.040 --> 03:42:26.040
That's it, definitely.

03:42:26.040 --> 03:42:28.040
How long have you been waiting here?

03:42:28.040 --> 03:42:30.040
Oh, about an hour.

03:42:30.040 --> 03:42:32.040
One hour?

03:42:32.040 --> 03:42:34.040
She's not very punctual.

03:42:34.040 --> 03:42:36.040
Perhaps I was early.

03:42:36.040 --> 03:42:38.040
Yes, she was an hour early.

03:42:38.040 --> 03:42:40.040
Oh, it's grandma.

03:42:42.040 --> 03:42:44.040
Welcome, Alicia.

03:42:48.040 --> 03:42:52.040
Where do you find all these children, my dear?

03:42:52.040 --> 03:42:56.040
I was waiting here all alone and then they came along the path and wanted to help.

03:42:56.040 --> 03:42:58.040
Very kind of you, I'm sure.

03:42:58.040 --> 03:43:00.040
Well, don't just stand there, my dear.

03:43:00.040 --> 03:43:02.040
Let's go.

03:43:02.040 --> 03:43:04.040
Come along.

03:43:08.040 --> 03:43:10.040
Excuse me, ma'am.

03:43:10.040 --> 03:43:12.040
But don't you live in the forest?

03:43:12.040 --> 03:43:14.040
Indeed, I do.

03:43:14.040 --> 03:43:16.040
In what part of it?

03:43:16.040 --> 03:43:18.040
Let me see.

03:43:18.040 --> 03:43:20.040
It must be about right in the middle.

03:43:20.040 --> 03:43:22.040
Interesting.

03:43:22.040 --> 03:43:24.040
The only place I know of is an old house.

03:43:24.040 --> 03:43:28.040
The only place I know of is an old house where they say which is used to live.

03:43:28.040 --> 03:43:30.040
You don't say a man.

03:43:30.040 --> 03:43:32.040
Well, what do you know?

03:43:32.040 --> 03:43:34.040
What will he think of next?

03:43:46.040 --> 03:43:48.040
Her grandmother is...

03:43:48.040 --> 03:43:50.040
A witch, I think?

03:43:50.040 --> 03:43:52.040
But surely, they don't exist.

03:43:52.040 --> 03:43:56.040
Of course not, like dragons don't exist.

03:43:56.040 --> 03:43:58.040
Well, she doesn't seem like a nasty one.

03:43:58.040 --> 03:44:00.040
How can you tell, Moments?

03:44:00.040 --> 03:44:04.040
I don't think that nice girl would have a bad one for a grandma.

03:44:04.040 --> 03:44:06.040
Perhaps not.

03:44:06.040 --> 03:44:10.040
So tell me what makes you think she's a witch, eh?

03:44:10.040 --> 03:44:14.040
Who else could live in that forest, Papa?

03:44:14.040 --> 03:44:16.040
I can't think of anyone right now, but some people would like it.

03:44:16.040 --> 03:44:18.040
Yes, I suppose you're right.

03:44:18.040 --> 03:44:20.040
I hope you are.

03:44:20.040 --> 03:44:24.040
Well, I've lived in Moomin Valley for a long time and I've never once seen a witch.

03:44:24.040 --> 03:44:26.040
So they don't exist?

03:44:30.040 --> 03:44:32.040
Yes.

03:44:32.040 --> 03:44:34.040
Oh, stop working now, Snork. Dinner's ready.

03:44:34.040 --> 03:44:36.040
Fine, coming.

03:44:40.040 --> 03:44:42.040
No wonder it's so light. Look, the moon is up.

03:44:42.040 --> 03:44:44.040
Snork, Maiden.

03:44:44.040 --> 03:44:48.040
I think it would be very wise for you to stay with the Moomin's from tonight on.

03:44:48.040 --> 03:44:50.040
Why on earth do you think that's Snork?

03:44:50.040 --> 03:44:54.040
I've decided not to hibernate this winter.

03:44:54.040 --> 03:44:56.040
Why ever not?

03:44:56.040 --> 03:45:00.040
I want to complete the blueprint for my new flying ship by next spring.

03:45:00.040 --> 03:45:04.040
For a real inventor, sleep is an unnecessary luxury.

03:45:04.040 --> 03:45:08.040
Science, my dear Snork Maiden, will not wait while inventors take a nap.

03:45:08.040 --> 03:45:12.040
But you know, dear Snork, how dependent you are on your sleep.

03:45:12.040 --> 03:45:14.040
I'll stay with you.

03:45:14.040 --> 03:45:17.040
Very well, then, this winter I will hibernate with the Moomin's.

03:45:17.040 --> 03:45:21.040
Excellent. Shall we have dinner? I'm ready now.

03:45:31.040 --> 03:45:35.040
Well, certainly, Snork. Snork Maiden will be just fine here with us.

03:45:35.040 --> 03:45:37.040
Thank you.

03:45:37.040 --> 03:45:41.040
This is nice for Moomin, too. Now he'll have Snork Maiden to keep him company.

03:45:41.040 --> 03:45:43.040
Yes.

03:45:43.040 --> 03:45:47.040
But who needs company when they're hibernating? After all, Moomin will be fast asleep.

03:45:47.040 --> 03:45:49.040
Never the less.

03:45:49.040 --> 03:45:53.040
Sleeping is much nicer when someone else sleeps in the same room.

03:45:53.040 --> 03:45:55.040
When do we start hibernating, do you think?

03:45:55.040 --> 03:45:57.040
With weather like this in another few days, I guess.

03:45:57.040 --> 03:45:59.040
So early?

03:45:59.040 --> 03:46:01.040
We'll have snow before the week is out.

03:46:01.040 --> 03:46:03.040
Well, good luck with your new blueprint, Snork.

03:46:03.040 --> 03:46:07.040
I look forward to seeing your flying ship in the spring.

03:46:07.040 --> 03:46:11.040
Come this time next year. I'll definitely be flying about.

03:46:14.040 --> 03:46:19.040
Thanks again for taking Snork Maiden. That's not trouble at all. Good night, then.

03:46:19.040 --> 03:46:21.040
Good night, Snork.

03:46:21.040 --> 03:46:23.040
See you, Snork Maiden.

03:46:23.040 --> 03:46:27.040
Good luck this winter, Snork.

03:46:31.040 --> 03:46:37.040
Thank goodness that last I can really concentrate on my work.

03:46:44.040 --> 03:46:47.040
I don't believe this.

03:46:51.040 --> 03:46:53.040
Am I hallucinating?

03:47:07.040 --> 03:47:09.040
Oh!

03:47:14.040 --> 03:47:20.040
Oh, which I'm sure it was. I'm positive. I'm a broomstick.

03:47:20.040 --> 03:47:25.040
When the snork gets an idea in his head, it's not much room for anyone or anything else.

03:47:25.040 --> 03:47:28.040
I hope you'll succeed this time.

03:47:28.040 --> 03:47:31.040
At least in my dream that rounding really flew well.

03:47:31.040 --> 03:47:35.040
I often dream that I fly, but I wouldn't dream of trying it out.

03:47:35.040 --> 03:47:39.040
Snork must have had some sort of a new idea.

03:47:39.040 --> 03:47:41.040
It's Snork.

03:47:44.040 --> 03:47:48.040
What's the matter?

03:47:56.040 --> 03:48:00.040
Oh, that's my piece of cake.

03:48:00.040 --> 03:48:03.040
You look like you've seen a ghost.

03:48:03.040 --> 03:48:06.040
Not a ghost. She laughed at me.

03:48:06.040 --> 03:48:09.040
Where did? She was flying on a broom.

03:48:09.040 --> 03:48:10.040
No engine at all.

03:48:10.040 --> 03:48:12.040
Are you talking about the witch?

03:48:12.040 --> 03:48:16.040
I can't use this no point if you can do it so easily.

03:48:16.040 --> 03:48:18.040
We're going to jump together.

03:48:18.040 --> 03:48:19.040
You really swore?

03:48:19.040 --> 03:48:20.040
Yes.

03:48:20.040 --> 03:48:21.040
But where?

03:48:21.040 --> 03:48:23.040
Right near here.

03:48:29.040 --> 03:48:34.040
I can't see any witch up there, Snork. Just the moon up in the sky.

03:48:43.040 --> 03:48:47.040
And she was really flying in the sky? Is that what Snork said?

03:48:47.040 --> 03:48:50.040
Well, he should know about things that fly.

03:48:50.040 --> 03:48:53.040
But I just can't believe it until I've seen it myself.

03:48:53.040 --> 03:48:56.040
If she really is a witch, then what about the girl?

03:48:56.040 --> 03:48:59.040
I mean, no one could be happy living with a witch.

03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:02.040
I really don't know. I thought witches had to be old.

03:49:02.040 --> 03:49:06.040
Maybe it's not her real grandmother. She could be adopted.

03:49:06.040 --> 03:49:09.040
Well, moment, we must get to the bottom of this.

03:49:09.040 --> 03:49:11.040
Yes, Snuffkin. We must.

03:49:13.040 --> 03:49:14.040
Hmm.

03:49:18.040 --> 03:49:21.040
Ha, I caught you at it again, you and your secret plan.

03:49:21.040 --> 03:49:23.040
Where are you going?

03:49:23.040 --> 03:49:25.040
Today you can't come with us with a little fly.

03:49:25.040 --> 03:49:26.040
And why not?

03:49:26.040 --> 03:49:28.040
Because we're going on a dangerous mission.

03:49:28.040 --> 03:49:30.040
We're going to the forest of witches.

03:49:30.040 --> 03:49:35.040
Well, if you're in any danger, then I must certainly come along to look after you, Moon.

03:49:35.040 --> 03:49:36.040
Come on.

03:49:38.040 --> 03:49:41.040
Besides, nothing's exciting to happen to me since I went up with that kite.

03:49:42.040 --> 03:49:44.040
This is so exciting.

03:49:44.040 --> 03:49:49.040
Ha, sleeping only through a set of four that I must cram in one adventure first.

03:49:49.040 --> 03:49:52.040
This is what we'll do. I grabbed the witch and while she's helpless,

03:49:52.040 --> 03:49:54.040
you two grabbed the girl and whisk her away to safety.

03:49:54.040 --> 03:49:58.040
That sounds great, but we don't know if she is a witch, little Mai.

03:49:58.040 --> 03:50:03.040
If we grab her and she isn't a witch, it would be embarrassing and we could all be in trouble.

03:50:03.040 --> 03:50:08.040
Maybe the witch needed an innocent maiden to try out some potions to experiment on her.

03:50:08.040 --> 03:50:10.040
Maybe, let's find out.

03:50:10.040 --> 03:50:11.040
How do we find out?

03:50:11.040 --> 03:50:13.040
By snooping around, I suppose.

03:50:13.040 --> 03:50:17.040
I hope you'll think of something a bit better than that before we get there.

03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:22.040
Let's hide as close to the house as we can and then ask the girl as soon as she comes out.

03:50:23.040 --> 03:50:26.040
And what if she doesn't come out, Snuffkin?

03:50:26.040 --> 03:50:28.040
Then we'll improvise, little Mai.

03:50:28.040 --> 03:50:31.040
So this is the famous plan by the great Snuffkin.

03:50:31.040 --> 03:50:36.040
Look, if she doesn't come out of the house, we'll just go up and knock on the door.

03:50:37.040 --> 03:50:41.040
Once we're inside, I'm sure we'll be able to tell what's really what.

03:50:41.040 --> 03:50:44.040
I don't think it's a very good idea.

03:50:44.040 --> 03:50:46.040
What if she can't just spell on us?

03:50:46.040 --> 03:50:51.040
Little Mai will wait outside and if we don't come out, she can run back to Moomin Valley for help.

03:50:51.040 --> 03:50:55.040
That's fine, but Moomin can wait outside and I'll search the house.

03:50:55.040 --> 03:50:58.040
Oh no, little Mai, you can wait outside and I will search the house.

03:50:58.040 --> 03:51:00.040
Let's do it this way.

03:51:00.040 --> 03:51:03.040
You stay outside and if we get caught, try to free us.

03:51:03.040 --> 03:51:06.040
And run for help as quickly as you can only if you can't.

03:51:06.040 --> 03:51:08.040
Is that okay?

03:51:08.040 --> 03:51:11.040
Hmm, that means if you're in trouble, your lives will be in my hands.

03:51:11.040 --> 03:51:13.040
That's right, little Mai.

03:51:13.040 --> 03:51:17.040
I don't like this out of this. I'm not sure I want little Mai to be my last hope.

03:51:17.040 --> 03:51:20.040
Well, I wouldn't help anyone who doesn't trust me, that's for sure.

03:51:20.040 --> 03:51:22.040
Here's that? See what I mean?

03:51:22.040 --> 03:51:25.040
Be quiet.

03:51:25.040 --> 03:51:27.040
There's a house.

03:51:27.040 --> 03:51:34.040
Look at this.

03:51:34.040 --> 03:51:37.040
It's very quiet, do you think there's anybody home?

03:51:37.040 --> 03:51:40.040
I don't know, let's wait a while and see.

03:51:40.040 --> 03:51:43.040
Do we have to stay absolutely still?

03:51:43.040 --> 03:51:48.040
But of course we do. We'll feel extremely silly if the house is empty.

03:51:48.040 --> 03:51:52.040
They've disappeared. They could have told us where they were going.

03:51:52.040 --> 03:51:55.040
I'm sure I don't care. Little Mai went too, I think.

03:51:55.040 --> 03:51:58.040
She's betrayed us, that's just like her.

03:51:58.040 --> 03:52:01.040
Don't worry, I've got a pretty good idea where they were heading for.

03:52:01.040 --> 03:52:05.040
You know where they've gone? Why didn't you tell me? Where are they?

03:52:05.040 --> 03:52:08.040
They've gone to the forest of witches.

03:52:08.040 --> 03:52:09.040
What?

03:52:09.040 --> 03:52:12.040
They've gone to see whether the woman we met yesterday is a real witch.

03:52:12.040 --> 03:52:14.040
A real one?

03:52:14.040 --> 03:52:19.040
Why don't we go there too? I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find my way, Sniff.

03:52:19.040 --> 03:52:21.040
What is it?

03:52:21.040 --> 03:52:24.040
I don't know, it's my stomach, I better lie down.

03:52:24.040 --> 03:52:29.040
Oh, it's very painful.

03:52:29.040 --> 03:52:33.040
Oh, how much longer we can have to stay here like this?

03:52:33.040 --> 03:52:36.040
This adventure isn't the least bit exciting.

03:52:36.040 --> 03:52:38.040
Well, let's wait a little bit longer. Be quiet.

03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:40.040
At least we know the girl is definitely in there.

03:52:40.040 --> 03:52:44.040
No, we don't. She might be out. She could be anywhere.

03:52:44.040 --> 03:52:47.040
I know that's possible, but I don't think so.

03:52:52.040 --> 03:52:54.040
She's getting some water.

03:52:54.040 --> 03:52:57.040
As I thought, that way she's working her to the bone.

03:52:57.040 --> 03:52:59.040
Hey, little boy.

03:52:59.040 --> 03:53:01.040
She's following that girl.

03:53:01.040 --> 03:53:04.040
You go with her, Moomin, and find out as much as you possibly can about what's going on.

03:53:04.040 --> 03:53:06.040
I'll watch the house.

03:53:06.040 --> 03:53:08.040
Right.

03:53:09.040 --> 03:53:12.040
Hey, wait for me.

03:53:22.040 --> 03:53:24.040
Oh.

03:53:45.040 --> 03:53:47.040
Huh.

03:53:51.040 --> 03:53:54.040
Oh.

03:54:22.040 --> 03:54:26.040
If you're looking for Alicia, she's out.

03:54:28.040 --> 03:54:33.040
Stop. Listen. Wait and see.

03:54:33.040 --> 03:54:36.040
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

03:54:36.040 --> 03:54:39.040
Why did you try to run away then?

03:54:43.040 --> 03:54:46.040
Oh, I'll help you with that.

03:54:46.040 --> 03:54:47.040
So will I.

03:54:47.040 --> 03:54:50.040
How kind of you. It is a bit heavy to carry, you know.

03:54:50.040 --> 03:54:52.040
I think I remember your name.

03:54:52.040 --> 03:54:53.040
Is it Alicia?

03:54:53.040 --> 03:54:56.040
Yes, it is. I'm so glad you remembered it.

03:54:56.040 --> 03:54:57.040
My name is Moomin.

03:54:57.040 --> 03:54:58.040
And I'm a little mind.

03:54:58.040 --> 03:55:00.040
What are you doing here in the forest of witches?

03:55:00.040 --> 03:55:05.040
Well, to be perfectly honest, we came because we were rather worried about you.

03:55:05.040 --> 03:55:07.040
What about me? Why is that?

03:55:07.040 --> 03:55:10.040
Is that a woman really your grandmother?

03:55:10.040 --> 03:55:11.040
Of course.

03:55:11.040 --> 03:55:12.040
You're quite sure?

03:55:12.040 --> 03:55:15.040
Yes, of course. She's my mother's mother. Why do you ask?

03:55:15.040 --> 03:55:17.040
Well, don't you know?

03:55:18.040 --> 03:55:20.040
He's trying to ask.

03:55:20.040 --> 03:55:23.040
Well, maybe your grandmother is a witch.

03:55:23.040 --> 03:55:25.040
Yes, she is.

03:55:25.040 --> 03:55:26.040
Of course.

03:55:26.040 --> 03:55:29.040
Oh, I'm sorry. I was a bit taken aback.

03:55:29.040 --> 03:55:32.040
You don't mind about your grandmother being a real witch?

03:55:32.040 --> 03:55:34.040
Oh, no. That's what she is.

03:55:34.040 --> 03:55:38.040
I was husband. I'm going to be one, two, and I'm grown up.

03:55:38.040 --> 03:55:42.040
Oh, no. You couldn't. Well, you don't look anything like one.

03:55:42.040 --> 03:55:44.040
Well, that's because I'm not one yet.

03:55:44.040 --> 03:55:47.040
When you're born into a witch family, that's what you become.

03:55:47.040 --> 03:55:49.040
But it's not that easy, you know.

03:55:49.040 --> 03:55:51.040
Oh, this is too much.

03:55:51.040 --> 03:55:55.040
Now, tell me, what are you doing here in the forest of witches?

03:55:55.040 --> 03:55:57.040
You don't sound like a witch.

03:55:57.040 --> 03:55:59.040
Oh, really? What do witches sound like?

03:55:59.040 --> 03:56:02.040
Well, to be honest, you're the first one I've ever met in my whole life.

03:56:02.040 --> 03:56:05.040
I'm sure that's just what you think, young man.

03:56:05.040 --> 03:56:08.040
Is it true that the nice girl is really your granddaughter?

03:56:08.040 --> 03:56:11.040
Certainly. A very promising young girl.

03:56:11.040 --> 03:56:14.040
Honest and hardworking, and with a lot of training,

03:56:14.040 --> 03:56:16.040
she will make an excellent witch someday.

03:56:16.040 --> 03:56:19.040
But how can you possibly turn such a sweet girl into a witch?

03:56:19.040 --> 03:56:21.040
The sweetest girls make the best witches.

03:56:21.040 --> 03:56:24.040
Hello, didn't know you were back, grandma.

03:56:24.040 --> 03:56:26.040
Thank you for getting the water, Alicia.

03:56:26.040 --> 03:56:28.040
Oh, who's that?

03:56:28.040 --> 03:56:33.040
I don't know. Some naive young man out to rescue a damsel in distress now.

03:56:33.040 --> 03:56:35.040
I remember you, your snuffkin.

03:56:35.040 --> 03:56:37.040
Yes.

03:56:38.040 --> 03:56:42.040
Your friend snuffkins in here, why don't you come in, too?

03:56:42.040 --> 03:56:44.040
In the house? Really?

03:56:44.040 --> 03:56:46.040
He's brought friends with him, Addy.

03:56:46.040 --> 03:56:49.040
Self-killed. Whatever they're done to you.

03:56:49.040 --> 03:56:51.040
I'll take care of that.

03:56:51.040 --> 03:56:54.040
Wait a second. I'll do it for you.

03:56:54.040 --> 03:56:55.040
I'll fix it.

03:57:01.040 --> 03:57:03.040
Wait. I'm gonna need you again.

03:57:03.040 --> 03:57:04.040
Where'd you go in?

03:57:04.040 --> 03:57:07.040
I don't think that snake ever got bitten before.

03:57:07.040 --> 03:57:09.040
I'll get another.

03:57:09.040 --> 03:57:12.040
I'm very curious. Why are you three here, huh?

03:57:12.040 --> 03:57:14.040
They came all the way from Moomin Valley

03:57:14.040 --> 03:57:16.040
because they were really worried about me, grandma.

03:57:16.040 --> 03:57:18.040
Worried about you?

03:57:18.040 --> 03:57:20.040
Yes. They thought you might be nasty to me

03:57:20.040 --> 03:57:23.040
so they came all this way to see if I needed help.

03:57:23.040 --> 03:57:25.040
This always happens.

03:57:25.040 --> 03:57:27.040
People treat witches as if they weren't ordinary,

03:57:27.040 --> 03:57:30.040
respectable, responsible citizens.

03:57:30.040 --> 03:57:32.040
No, no. We're very sorry.

03:57:32.040 --> 03:57:34.040
We realize she's quite okay

03:57:34.040 --> 03:57:37.040
and she's most welcome to visit us in Moomin Valley

03:57:37.040 --> 03:57:39.040
at any time, isn't she, Snuffkin?

03:57:39.040 --> 03:57:41.040
Yes, certainly.

03:57:41.040 --> 03:57:44.040
What? You said you'd visit these people?

03:57:44.040 --> 03:57:46.040
Oh, yes. I thought I'd go over there sometimes

03:57:46.040 --> 03:57:49.040
after I finished with my homework, of course.

03:57:49.040 --> 03:57:51.040
I would never leave my studies half done.

03:57:51.040 --> 03:57:55.040
Sorry, Alicia, but if you ever want to become a good witch,

03:57:55.040 --> 03:57:58.040
you mustn't see any ordinary mortals.

03:57:58.040 --> 03:57:59.040
Oh, why not?

03:57:59.040 --> 03:58:02.040
I've only just become friends with them, grandma, please.

03:58:02.040 --> 03:58:04.040
I know. Why don't I wait a year

03:58:04.040 --> 03:58:07.040
and study to be a witch next year?

03:58:07.040 --> 03:58:09.040
Alicia.

03:58:11.040 --> 03:58:13.040
This is family business.

03:58:13.040 --> 03:58:15.040
So if you don't mind, I would appreciate it

03:58:15.040 --> 03:58:17.040
if you were to leave.

03:58:17.040 --> 03:58:20.040
And I'd like you to go immediately if you please.

03:58:30.040 --> 03:58:33.040
It's snowing.

03:58:33.040 --> 03:58:36.040
Well, she certainly won't be able to visit us

03:58:36.040 --> 03:58:38.040
at Moomin Valley is buried in snow,

03:58:38.040 --> 03:58:40.040
so we might never see her again.

03:58:40.040 --> 03:58:42.040
No, that's right.

03:58:42.040 --> 03:58:46.040
And you'll be leaving soon, won't you, Snuffkin?

03:58:46.040 --> 03:58:50.040
Winter had come once again to Moomin Valley.

03:58:59.040 --> 03:59:09.040
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

03:59:09.040 --> 03:59:16.040
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

03:59:16.040 --> 03:59:20.040
They're always happy and goes at play.

03:59:20.040 --> 03:59:24.040
The Moons are having fun day after day.

03:59:24.040 --> 03:59:27.040
The Moons.

03:59:27.040 --> 03:59:31.040
The Moons.

03:59:31.040 --> 03:59:37.040
The Moons.

03:59:58.040 --> 04:00:02.040
Here they are for one and all.

04:00:02.040 --> 04:00:05.040
The Moomins are about to call.

04:00:05.040 --> 04:00:08.040
Come on and sit down here with me.

04:00:08.040 --> 04:00:11.040
They're here for you on your TV.

04:00:11.040 --> 04:00:14.040
They are the movements.

04:00:14.040 --> 04:00:17.040
They are the movements.

04:00:17.040 --> 04:00:20.040
So come with me, give me your hand.

04:00:20.040 --> 04:00:23.040
I'll take you up to Moomin Land.

04:00:23.040 --> 04:00:26.040
You can fly just like a bird.

04:00:26.040 --> 04:00:28.040
Sing thepass song ever.

04:00:28.040 --> 04:00:31.040
There were the movements.

04:00:31.040 --> 04:00:34.040
There were the movements.

04:00:34.040 --> 04:00:37.040
There were the movements.

04:00:37.040 --> 04:00:40.040
There was the movement.

04:00:40.040 --> 04:00:43.040
There were the movements.

04:00:43.040 --> 04:00:47.040
There were the movements.

04:00:48.040 --> 04:00:52.040
The snow was getting thicker on the ground.

04:00:52.040 --> 04:00:56.040
and it was high time for the movements to start hibernating.

04:01:17.040 --> 04:01:21.040
What are you doing, new man? Alicia? What do you do with these pine needles?

04:01:22.040 --> 04:01:26.040
That's what we always eat before we hibernate. Nobody knows why.

04:01:26.040 --> 04:01:28.040
So you're going to start hibernating?

04:01:28.040 --> 04:01:29.040
Yes, tonight.

04:01:29.040 --> 04:01:31.040
Oh, that's soon?

04:01:31.040 --> 04:01:32.040
Yes.

04:01:32.040 --> 04:01:36.040
I'm so glad I've come to see you today instead of leaving until tomorrow then.

04:01:37.040 --> 04:01:40.040
I must say you came on just the right day, Alicia.

04:01:40.040 --> 04:01:45.040
We usually have a small party the night we start hibernating and you've arrived just in time.

04:01:45.040 --> 04:01:48.040
Oh, you mean I can stay for that woman, Mama?

04:01:49.040 --> 04:01:55.040
And by the way, Alicia is a matter of interest as to which, sorry, your grandmother, I mean, know that you're here?

04:01:55.040 --> 04:01:59.040
No, I'm afraid I didn't tell her. Better for grown-ups not to know too much.

04:01:59.040 --> 04:02:01.040
Oh, do you say you're right?

04:02:01.040 --> 04:02:04.040
I'm afraid she's not very happy for me to come here to Moomin Valley.

04:02:04.040 --> 04:02:06.040
Why ever not my dear?

04:02:06.040 --> 04:02:11.040
I guess she's afraid that if I start coming here to play, I shall lose interest in studying hard at my witchcraft.

04:02:11.040 --> 04:02:15.040
Oh, but you've got a very long time to go before you're a witch?

04:02:15.040 --> 04:02:19.040
It takes anything between five to seven years nowadays.

04:02:19.040 --> 04:02:22.040
Are you really sure that's what you want to be, Alicia?

04:02:22.040 --> 04:02:23.040
Study something out.

04:02:23.040 --> 04:02:25.040
But I want to be a witch.

04:02:25.040 --> 04:02:28.040
Perhaps you don't know, but witches aren't terribly popular.

04:02:28.040 --> 04:02:32.040
Yes, I do, but I won't be like that. I'll be popular.

04:02:34.040 --> 04:02:37.040
Hey, Snuffkin!

04:02:39.040 --> 04:02:41.040
You're off to the moments?

04:02:41.040 --> 04:02:42.040
Yes.

04:02:43.040 --> 04:02:45.040
I thought you'd gone south already.

04:02:45.040 --> 04:02:48.040
Last winter you'd gone before the snow started.

04:02:48.040 --> 04:02:50.040
Not this year, I promised Moomin.

04:02:50.040 --> 04:02:51.040
Promise?

04:02:51.040 --> 04:02:54.040
I promised not to leave Moomin Valley until he went into hibernation.

04:02:59.040 --> 04:03:02.040
Everybody seems to be here, and somebody new.

04:03:02.040 --> 04:03:03.040
Who's that?

04:03:03.040 --> 04:03:05.040
Have a guess.

04:03:05.040 --> 04:03:08.040
Very well, then. It's Alicia, that's my guess.

04:03:08.040 --> 04:03:10.040
How did you know?

04:03:10.040 --> 04:03:12.040
What? I'm right?

04:03:12.040 --> 04:03:15.040
Yes, you are, but I think you peaked and saw her earlier on.

04:03:15.040 --> 04:03:19.040
I did it. I just named somebody I thought couldn't be here.

04:03:19.040 --> 04:03:20.040
Clever, huh?

04:03:20.040 --> 04:03:24.040
Well, she just happened to stop by. She's with Papa, who's showing her around the house.

04:03:24.040 --> 04:03:26.040
Is the witch here, too?

04:03:26.040 --> 04:03:29.040
No, she didn't tell the witch she was coming here.

04:03:29.040 --> 04:03:31.040
Just as well. Thank goodness.

04:03:34.040 --> 04:03:39.040
Ah, it's you, Snuffkin. I finally came over. I told you I would.

04:03:39.040 --> 04:03:40.040
Hi.

04:03:40.040 --> 04:03:43.040
Remember our friend here? He's called Sniff.

04:03:43.040 --> 04:03:45.040
Hi. How do you do Sniff?

04:03:45.040 --> 04:03:50.040
Well, you aren't going to use your magic to cast any spells and stuff, are you?

04:03:50.040 --> 04:03:52.040
No.

04:03:57.040 --> 04:04:01.040
Actually, they didn't need just pine needles for dinner that evening.

04:04:01.040 --> 04:04:05.040
They had lots of other nice things, too. All cooked by Moomin Mama.

04:04:05.040 --> 04:04:08.040
Snuffkin, I'd like to say how story I am.

04:04:08.040 --> 04:04:09.040
Why?

04:04:09.040 --> 04:04:13.040
I persuaded you to stay on here instead of going south as you'd planned.

04:04:13.040 --> 04:04:15.040
I'm leaving tomorrow.

04:04:15.040 --> 04:04:17.040
But the snow is quite deep.

04:04:17.040 --> 04:04:20.040
Don't worry, I'm used to deep snow.

04:04:20.040 --> 04:04:23.040
I'm just worried Alicia will find it hard to get home in this.

04:04:23.040 --> 04:04:28.040
Well, she could spell the night here, but of course tomorrow will be asleep for the winter, so...

04:04:32.040 --> 04:04:33.040
Huh?

04:04:33.040 --> 04:04:35.040
Hmm? Someone's at the door.

04:04:35.040 --> 04:04:37.040
I'll see who it is.

04:04:38.040 --> 04:04:45.040
Oh, hello. How are you?

04:04:45.040 --> 04:04:51.040
Hello indeed, my young man. My granddaughter is here, isn't she?

04:04:51.040 --> 04:04:54.040
Who is it then, Moomin?

04:04:54.040 --> 04:04:56.040
Oh, my dear.

04:04:56.040 --> 04:04:58.040
You must be Moomin Papa.

04:05:02.040 --> 04:05:04.040
Now, you listen to me, Moomin Papa.

04:05:04.040 --> 04:05:08.040
I don't want my granddaughter playing with your children under any circumstances.

04:05:08.040 --> 04:05:10.040
Do I make myself quite clear?

04:05:10.040 --> 04:05:12.040
But Alicia likes playing with us.

04:05:12.040 --> 04:05:13.040
Grandma!

04:05:13.040 --> 04:05:16.040
We're leaving. Can't I stay a little longer?

04:05:16.040 --> 04:05:19.040
Hello, you're most welcome to stay and have dinner with us.

04:05:19.040 --> 04:05:23.040
Don't you know I'm a witch? I can't eat that sort of baby food.

04:05:23.040 --> 04:05:25.040
Alicia quite likes the food.

04:05:25.040 --> 04:05:29.040
The pine needles look okay. The rest is yucky. Come, Alicia.

04:05:29.040 --> 04:05:31.040
Please let me stay, Grandma.

04:05:32.040 --> 04:05:35.040
I've told you before, which is never mixed with people like this,

04:05:35.040 --> 04:05:37.040
and that goes for novice, which is as well.

04:05:37.040 --> 04:05:38.040
Never.

04:05:38.040 --> 04:05:40.040
With their knives, they're really all, Grandma.

04:05:40.040 --> 04:05:42.040
And I told you, that's the trouble.

04:05:42.040 --> 04:05:45.040
They are disgustingly, signally good.

04:05:46.040 --> 04:05:49.040
You will hear a lot more about this when we get home.

04:05:49.040 --> 04:05:51.040
Come on now.

04:05:51.040 --> 04:05:55.040
It's really cold out here, and there's a lot more snow on the way.

04:05:56.040 --> 04:05:58.040
All right, I'm coming, Grandma.

04:05:58.040 --> 04:05:59.040
Coming.

04:05:59.040 --> 04:06:01.040
Oh, thank you.

04:06:01.040 --> 04:06:02.040
Mum and Papa.

04:06:02.040 --> 04:06:03.040
Yeah?

04:06:03.040 --> 04:06:05.040
We understand each other now, don't we?

04:06:05.040 --> 04:06:07.040
I'm sure you understand me.

04:06:07.040 --> 04:06:09.040
Never mind about that.

04:06:09.040 --> 04:06:12.040
You and your whole family are never to speak to my granddaughter again.

04:06:12.040 --> 04:06:14.040
Is that understood?

04:06:14.040 --> 04:06:16.040
But Grandma!

04:06:16.040 --> 04:06:19.040
Mind what I say over a vengeance of touch will come upon you,

04:06:19.040 --> 04:06:21.040
or even the revenge of a serious.

04:06:21.040 --> 04:06:24.040
If you think cheap threats like that impress Mum and Papa,

04:06:24.040 --> 04:06:26.040
you're making a grave mistake.

04:06:26.040 --> 04:06:29.040
Mum and Papa is a highly educated gentleman.

04:06:29.040 --> 04:06:32.040
But I am a witch with three diplomas.

04:06:32.040 --> 04:06:33.040
Maybe so.

04:06:33.040 --> 04:06:37.040
But tell me, how can three diplomas help you to get home with all this snow?

04:06:37.040 --> 04:06:40.040
Ha! Child's play to an accredited witch.

04:06:40.040 --> 04:06:42.040
Come, Alicia.

04:06:44.040 --> 04:06:47.040
I've never seen one of these before, a little pep square.

04:06:48.040 --> 04:06:50.040
Is that really a witch's broom?

04:06:50.040 --> 04:06:51.040
Well, I never.

04:06:51.040 --> 04:06:53.040
Let's go and see.

04:06:57.040 --> 04:06:58.040
I'm ready!

04:06:58.040 --> 04:06:59.040
Hold on tight, Alicia.

04:06:59.040 --> 04:07:00.040
Okay.

04:07:00.040 --> 04:07:03.040
Can you both ride on that broom?

04:07:03.040 --> 04:07:05.040
It looks pretty scrappy to me.

04:07:05.040 --> 04:07:07.040
Could fall to pieces any minute.

04:07:07.040 --> 04:07:09.040
Do drive slowly in this weather.

04:07:09.040 --> 04:07:12.040
Oh, please don't fall off, Alicia.

04:07:12.040 --> 04:07:14.040
But terrible chatterboxes you all are.

04:07:14.040 --> 04:07:17.040
Please keep quiet out of you.

04:07:17.040 --> 04:07:19.040
Are you ready, girl?

04:07:19.040 --> 04:07:20.040
Yeah?

04:07:20.040 --> 04:07:22.040
Bet they'll never be able to take off.

04:07:22.040 --> 04:07:23.040
Huh?

04:07:23.040 --> 04:07:24.040
Ha!

04:07:24.040 --> 04:07:26.040
Ha!

04:07:46.040 --> 04:07:47.040
What is it, Grandma?

04:07:47.040 --> 04:07:48.040
Nothing.

04:07:48.040 --> 04:07:49.040
Oh!

04:07:52.040 --> 04:07:54.040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:07:54.040 --> 04:07:56.040
Just what I thought, they're too heavy.

04:07:56.040 --> 04:08:00.040
Listen, I could take Alicia's place, I'm not too heavy.

04:08:00.040 --> 04:08:03.040
Don't worry, I'm happy to walk home, Grandma.

04:08:03.040 --> 04:08:05.040
Don't be so ridiculous, child.

04:08:05.040 --> 04:08:07.040
You can't walk home in all this snow.

04:08:07.040 --> 04:08:08.040
You'll never make it.

04:08:08.040 --> 04:08:09.040
Only I had some skis.

04:08:09.040 --> 04:08:11.040
Come on, climb aboard.

04:08:11.040 --> 04:08:13.040
I'll try another spell.

04:08:13.040 --> 04:08:16.040
Grandma, are you worried because all those people are watching you?

04:08:16.040 --> 04:08:17.040
Shut up!

04:08:17.040 --> 04:08:19.040
I help you say the magic spell.

04:08:19.040 --> 04:08:20.040
Ah!

04:08:20.040 --> 04:08:21.040
Ah!

04:08:21.040 --> 04:08:22.040
Oh, hi!

04:08:22.040 --> 04:08:23.040
Oh!

04:08:23.040 --> 04:08:24.040
Oh!

04:08:24.040 --> 04:08:25.040
Oh!

04:08:25.040 --> 04:08:26.040
Oh!

04:08:26.040 --> 04:08:27.040
Oh!

04:08:27.040 --> 04:08:28.040
Oh!

04:08:28.040 --> 04:08:29.040
Oh!

04:08:29.040 --> 04:08:30.040
Oh!

04:08:30.040 --> 04:08:31.040
Oh!

04:08:31.040 --> 04:08:32.040
Oh!

04:08:32.040 --> 04:08:34.040
They're doing it!

04:08:34.040 --> 04:08:35.040
Oh!

04:08:35.040 --> 04:08:36.040
Oh!

04:08:36.040 --> 04:08:37.040
Oh!

04:08:37.040 --> 04:08:38.040
What?

04:08:38.040 --> 04:08:39.040
Oh!

04:08:39.040 --> 04:08:40.040
Oh!

04:08:40.040 --> 04:08:41.040
Oh!

04:08:41.040 --> 04:08:42.040
Oh!

04:08:42.040 --> 04:08:43.040
Oh!

04:08:43.040 --> 04:08:44.040
Oh!

04:08:44.040 --> 04:08:45.040
Oh!

04:08:45.040 --> 04:08:46.040
Oh!

04:08:46.040 --> 04:08:47.040
Oh!

04:08:47.040 --> 04:08:49.040
Oh!

04:08:49.040 --> 04:08:50.540
Where are we going?

04:08:50.540 --> 04:08:51.540
Oh!

04:08:51.540 --> 04:08:52.540
Ah!

04:08:52.540 --> 04:08:53.540
Oh!

04:08:53.540 --> 04:08:54.540
Oh!

04:08:54.540 --> 04:08:55.540
Oh!

04:08:55.540 --> 04:08:56.540
Oh!

04:08:59.540 --> 04:09:00.540
Oh!

04:09:00.540 --> 04:09:01.540
Oh!

04:09:01.540 --> 04:09:02.540
Wow!

04:09:02.540 --> 04:09:03.540
One!

04:09:03.540 --> 04:09:04.540
Will you marry everybody goodbye?

04:09:04.540 --> 04:09:05.540
Wow!

04:09:05.540 --> 04:09:06.540
Oh!

04:09:06.540 --> 04:09:07.540
Wow!

04:09:07.540 --> 04:09:08.540
That's a z fix!

04:09:08.540 --> 04:09:12.540
She may have three diplomas, but I don't think she's very good, Mama.

04:09:12.540 --> 04:09:17.780
But I don't think she's very good mama. I wish they'd sing to the ground so I could fly that room

04:09:17.980 --> 04:09:21.740
Guess they're all right now, woman papa. Let's go back to our dinner

04:09:30.740 --> 04:09:34.300
Oh, I forgot to thank them for asking me to stand a dinner

04:09:34.780 --> 04:09:40.640
Thank them indeed. I don't think you're cut out to be a witch over grandma. I don't want to be one

04:09:40.640 --> 04:09:44.520
Well, I'm quite happy to help with the path will certainly be a difficult one

04:10:10.640 --> 04:10:30.080
With Alessia and the witch gone home to the Valley of the Witches Snuffkin departed for his trip south and the Moomins went into hibernation

04:10:41.480 --> 04:10:49.280
They certainly would have slept till the beginning of the spring is usual, but this year

04:10:58.240 --> 04:11:01.040
Quite unexpectedly something happened

04:11:10.640 --> 04:11:12.640
Oh

04:11:41.640 --> 04:11:43.640
Oh

04:11:49.920 --> 04:11:51.920
Spring here already

04:11:57.240 --> 04:11:59.240
There's someone at the window

04:12:00.080 --> 04:12:02.080
Oh

04:12:08.120 --> 04:12:10.120
It's frozen shut

04:12:19.640 --> 04:12:26.200
Hey, why did you wake me up? Well, you shouldn't be asleep. Didn't you know Christmas is coming?

04:12:26.480 --> 04:12:29.080
It's tomorrow, so there's not a minute to be lost

04:12:29.880 --> 04:12:33.000
Christmas is coming tomorrow, but who on earth is that?

04:12:33.560 --> 04:12:39.000
Why who is Christmas? This isn't a joke moment. I'm not in the least ready

04:12:39.000 --> 04:12:45.920
I've lost my mittens and Christmas is coming and I haven't got a firtry yet a firtry. I really must get a firtry

04:12:49.240 --> 04:12:52.280
How very odd why a firtry

04:12:53.240 --> 04:12:55.240
Hey

04:12:55.240 --> 04:12:57.240
Why

04:13:01.240 --> 04:13:05.520
Well Christmas is almost coming and we don't have a firtry yet Christmas

04:13:06.640 --> 04:13:13.800
Hmm. Did you say Christmas is coming? Yes, and before that, why must have a firtry? What's this about a firtry?

04:13:14.320 --> 04:13:20.600
We need one to protect ourselves against this Christmas person moment mama. I am not really quite clear on that point

04:13:20.600 --> 04:13:23.440
But there's something awful that has to be kept away, right?

04:13:26.200 --> 04:13:28.200
I better go get a firtry

04:13:42.920 --> 04:13:48.920
Ha about the time you movements got up. How are you, Gafsey? Pretty good firtry, Dad

04:13:49.640 --> 04:13:51.640
Oh

04:13:51.640 --> 04:13:55.840
Thank you, Gafsey, but could you tell me something and what is one supposed to do with it?

04:13:59.120 --> 04:14:03.580
Really moving papa the way you can joke with such a straight face

04:14:04.320 --> 04:14:09.200
Joke hey love to stay, but I haven't even finished cooking yet

04:14:12.880 --> 04:14:15.480
Wasn't joking no one believe me either

04:14:18.920 --> 04:14:22.920
Would you like a little more, young man?

04:14:22.920 --> 04:14:26.920
No, thank you very much. I'm really nice and warm again now.

04:14:26.920 --> 04:14:30.920
I saw Moan Papa and Moan bring up a big tree!

04:14:30.920 --> 04:14:32.920
But what is one supposed to do with it?

04:14:32.920 --> 04:14:34.920
Don't you know? No.

04:14:34.920 --> 04:14:38.920
Why, you decorate it as beautifully as you can.

04:14:38.920 --> 04:14:40.920
Really?

04:14:43.920 --> 04:14:46.920
Christmas is coming, so I better be off.

04:14:46.920 --> 04:14:48.920
Everyone's talking of Christmas.

04:14:48.920 --> 04:14:50.920
By now, I've got a long way to go.

04:14:52.920 --> 04:14:54.920
Take care, dear.

04:15:00.920 --> 04:15:02.920
Hello.

04:15:02.920 --> 04:15:04.920
Hello.

04:15:06.920 --> 04:15:08.920
Bye-bye!

04:15:08.920 --> 04:15:10.920
Bye-bye!

04:15:12.920 --> 04:15:14.920
Who was that?

04:15:14.920 --> 04:15:18.920
He was in a hurry to get somewhere before Christmas, so I gave him some tea.

04:15:18.920 --> 04:15:20.920
Well, that was nice.

04:15:20.920 --> 04:15:22.920
And he told us what to do with the fir tree.

04:15:22.920 --> 04:15:24.920
What did he say?

04:15:24.920 --> 04:15:26.920
To decorate it beautifully.

04:15:26.920 --> 04:15:28.920
Decorate it, but why should we do that, Moan?

04:15:28.920 --> 04:15:32.920
I guess we must decorate the tree to make sure we keep Christmas happy.

04:15:32.920 --> 04:15:34.920
Yes, you're right.

04:15:34.920 --> 04:15:36.920
We'd better start doing it right away.

04:15:36.920 --> 04:15:38.920
Yes, I'm sure there's not a moment to lose.

04:15:38.920 --> 04:15:40.920
No.

04:15:40.920 --> 04:15:42.920
Yes, dear.

04:15:42.920 --> 04:15:44.920
They also say we have to cook lots of food for Christmas.

04:15:44.920 --> 04:15:46.920
Goodness.

04:15:46.920 --> 04:15:48.920
Well, at least he won't be eating us then.

04:15:58.920 --> 04:16:00.920
Here.

04:16:00.920 --> 04:16:02.920
Thank you, Snorkmaid.

04:16:02.920 --> 04:16:04.920
The ship means rather a lot to me.

04:16:04.920 --> 04:16:06.920
It will look fantastic on the tree, Papa.

04:16:06.920 --> 04:16:08.920
Yes, dear. I suppose you're right.

04:16:10.920 --> 04:16:20.920
Oh, why don't we put this at the top?

04:16:20.920 --> 04:16:22.920
This is Mars.

04:16:22.920 --> 04:16:26.920
Don't worry.

04:16:26.920 --> 04:16:30.920
That looks beautiful.

04:16:30.920 --> 04:16:32.920
Listen, everybody.

04:16:32.920 --> 04:16:36.920
I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas too.

04:16:36.920 --> 04:16:38.920
Really, Mama?

04:16:38.920 --> 04:16:42.920
I don't wonder what this Christmas will be like.

04:16:42.920 --> 04:16:46.920
What if it's an awful greedy, beastly monster like the grove?

04:16:46.920 --> 04:16:48.920
Don't worry, Snorkmaid.

04:16:48.920 --> 04:16:52.920
We'll give him lots of presents and stuff him full of food.

04:16:54.920 --> 04:16:58.920
Have you thought of any presents for Christmas yet?

04:16:58.920 --> 04:17:00.920
I don't know what to give him.

04:17:00.920 --> 04:17:02.920
Look, a seashell.

04:17:02.920 --> 04:17:06.920
Oh, that's a beauty.

04:17:07.920 --> 04:17:10.920
Oh, look, Mama, what I got for Christmas.

04:17:10.920 --> 04:17:13.920
I'm going to give him a pretty lure for fishing.

04:17:13.920 --> 04:17:15.920
I'm giving him this book.

04:17:15.920 --> 04:17:22.920
Great presents. I'm sure he'll be very happy with the moment family and not Thomas at all.

04:17:30.920 --> 04:17:33.920
I think Christmas will come any moment now.

04:17:33.920 --> 04:17:35.920
So do I.

04:17:35.920 --> 04:17:39.920
Oh, dear. I do hope he likes my pumpkin pie.

04:17:39.920 --> 04:17:41.920
He will.

04:17:41.920 --> 04:17:45.920
Imagine everyone in Moomin Valley being frightened.

04:17:53.920 --> 04:17:55.920
Are you sleepy?

04:17:55.920 --> 04:17:57.920
Yes, I am.

04:17:57.920 --> 04:17:59.920
I can't stay this scared for much longer.

04:17:59.920 --> 04:18:03.920
Better come before all the food freezes.

04:18:03.920 --> 04:18:09.920
Oh, he's coming.

04:18:11.920 --> 04:18:15.920
I never thought Christmas could be that small.

04:18:15.920 --> 04:18:17.920
Merry Christmas.

04:18:17.920 --> 04:18:20.920
Merry Christmas. Is that what he is?

04:18:20.920 --> 04:18:22.920
Well, it's just what you say.

04:18:22.920 --> 04:18:26.920
All of my life I have dreamed of seeing all this up close, honestly.

04:18:26.920 --> 04:18:30.920
I never really thought a Christmas tree could be this beautiful.

04:18:30.920 --> 04:18:32.920
Brought my friends, too.

04:18:32.920 --> 04:18:34.920
You're all very welcome.

04:18:34.920 --> 04:18:37.920
Oh, thank you. Hear that, everybody.

04:18:37.920 --> 04:18:39.920
We're all very welcome.

04:18:39.920 --> 04:18:41.920
Oh, man, let's get them.

04:18:41.920 --> 04:18:43.920
There's some wonderful things here.

04:18:45.920 --> 04:18:48.920
Oh, what a lot of food you've made.

04:18:48.920 --> 04:18:50.920
Yes, all the food there is for Christmas.

04:18:50.920 --> 04:18:53.920
And are those real presents?

04:18:53.920 --> 04:18:55.920
They are.

04:18:55.920 --> 04:18:59.920
All of my life, I've sort of wondered about those things called presents.

04:18:59.920 --> 04:19:02.920
Papa, I don't think these creatures are Christmas.

04:19:02.920 --> 04:19:05.920
Neither do I.

04:19:12.920 --> 04:19:14.920
You look sleepy, Mama.

04:19:14.920 --> 04:19:18.920
I am. Must be well past midnight.

04:19:18.920 --> 04:19:21.920
What is Christmas doing, Mama?

04:19:21.920 --> 04:19:23.920
Aren't you sleepy, two little ones?

04:19:23.920 --> 04:19:28.920
Sleepy with a wonderful Christmas tree like this to look at?

04:19:30.920 --> 04:19:31.920
Hey, Papa.

04:19:31.920 --> 04:19:32.920
What is it?

04:19:32.920 --> 04:19:35.920
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

04:19:35.920 --> 04:19:38.920
Maybe.

04:19:38.920 --> 04:19:41.920
Nobody can get really angry this late at night.

04:19:41.920 --> 04:19:45.920
Surely we'll close the doors and perhaps we'll be safe inside.

04:19:45.920 --> 04:19:47.920
I'm sure you're right.

04:19:47.920 --> 04:19:51.920
Listen, my friends, we'd like to give you the tree and the food and the presents.

04:19:51.920 --> 04:19:54.920
What? All of this?

04:19:54.920 --> 04:19:55.920
For us?

04:19:55.920 --> 04:19:57.920
Yes, we want to sleep.

04:19:57.920 --> 04:19:59.920
We're far more sleepy than scared.

04:20:02.920 --> 04:20:04.920
Snork, madam.

04:20:04.920 --> 04:20:06.920
Oh, I see here yet.

04:20:06.920 --> 04:20:09.920
No, but we decided to go back to hibernating.

04:20:18.920 --> 04:20:20.920
Papa!

04:20:26.920 --> 04:20:30.920
I thought Christmas tree should have a star on top.

04:20:30.920 --> 04:20:33.920
I don't think it makes any difference, you know?

04:20:33.920 --> 04:20:36.920
A nice rose is just as good as a star.

04:20:36.920 --> 04:20:38.920
Look at that!

04:20:56.920 --> 04:20:58.920
Hi!

04:21:01.920 --> 04:21:04.920
And apparently it didn't make any difference at all

04:21:04.920 --> 04:21:09.920
because the Moonman family slept as peacefully as ever all through the night

04:21:09.920 --> 04:21:13.920
without Christmas coming anywhere near them.

04:21:13.920 --> 04:21:16.920
So probably he went someplace else.

04:21:17.920 --> 04:21:25.920
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

04:21:25.920 --> 04:21:33.920
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:21:33.920 --> 04:21:37.920
They're always happy and goes at play.

04:21:37.920 --> 04:21:44.920
The Moons are having fun day after day, the Moons.

04:21:44.920 --> 04:21:47.920
The Moons.

04:21:47.920 --> 04:21:50.920
The Moons.

04:22:15.920 --> 04:22:19.920
Here they are for one and all.

04:22:19.920 --> 04:22:22.920
The Moons are about to call.

04:22:22.920 --> 04:22:25.920
Come on and sit down here with me.

04:22:25.920 --> 04:22:28.920
They're here for you on your TV.

04:22:28.920 --> 04:22:30.920
They are the movements.

04:22:30.920 --> 04:22:33.920
They are the movements.

04:22:33.920 --> 04:22:37.920
So come with me, give me your hand.

04:22:37.920 --> 04:22:40.920
I'll take you up to a movement land.

04:22:40.920 --> 04:22:43.920
You can fly just like a bird.

04:22:43.920 --> 04:22:45.920
Sing with the song ever.

04:22:45.920 --> 04:22:48.920
They're with the movement.

04:22:48.920 --> 04:22:51.920
They're with the movements.

04:22:51.920 --> 04:22:54.920
They're with the movements.

04:22:54.920 --> 04:22:57.920
They're with the movements.

04:22:57.920 --> 04:23:00.920
They're with the movements.

04:23:00.920 --> 04:23:03.920
They're with the movements.

04:23:13.920 --> 04:23:15.920
During his long winter sleep,

04:23:15.920 --> 04:23:25.920
the woman had a dream.

04:23:29.920 --> 04:23:33.920
And strangely enough, he dreamt that he was sleeping.

04:23:33.920 --> 04:23:37.920
Moment! Moment! Moment!

04:23:37.920 --> 04:23:39.920
Huh?

04:23:43.920 --> 04:23:49.920
Alicia! Alicia! Wow! You can fly on the broomstick now!

04:23:49.920 --> 04:23:53.920
That's right! I'm a fully fledged witch now, Moment!

04:23:53.920 --> 04:23:57.920
Wait! Give me a ride, Alicia! Can't do that!

04:23:57.920 --> 04:24:01.920
Oh, don't be mean, Alicia! Because someone's already riding with me!

04:24:01.920 --> 04:24:03.920
Oops! Man, it's me!

04:24:03.920 --> 04:24:05.920
Haha! Little boy!

04:24:05.920 --> 04:24:09.920
Would you mind if we went a little higher, Alicia? Sure!

04:24:09.920 --> 04:24:11.920
Oh, wow! Why, Alicia!

04:24:11.920 --> 04:24:13.920
Oh, you're keeping me going!

04:24:13.920 --> 04:24:15.920
What?

04:24:15.920 --> 04:24:17.920
Oh, please, listen!

04:24:17.920 --> 04:24:21.920
Come back! Please! Give me a ride, Alicia!

04:24:21.920 --> 04:24:23.920
Haha!

04:24:23.920 --> 04:24:25.920
Oh!

04:24:25.920 --> 04:24:27.920
Yeah!

04:24:35.920 --> 04:24:37.920
Oh, thank you, woman!

04:24:39.920 --> 04:24:41.920
Will you give me a ride now?

04:24:41.920 --> 04:24:43.920
Come on, now!

04:24:59.920 --> 04:25:03.920
Moment, Val, he's really beautiful from up here.

04:25:03.920 --> 04:25:05.920
Yes, lovely!

04:25:05.920 --> 04:25:07.920
Oh, Alicia, be careful! Don't do things like that!

04:25:07.920 --> 04:25:09.920
What are you talking about?

04:25:09.920 --> 04:25:11.920
We're not doing anything, woman!

04:25:11.920 --> 04:25:13.920
A little boy, it's you again!

04:25:13.920 --> 04:25:15.920
No wonder the broom is shaking so much!

04:25:15.920 --> 04:25:19.920
How do you like it? I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?

04:25:19.920 --> 04:25:21.920
Where did you get this broom from, little boy?

04:25:21.920 --> 04:25:23.920
I borrowed it from the witch!

04:25:23.920 --> 04:25:25.920
I borrowed it for a while!

04:25:25.920 --> 04:25:27.920
That's the witch, isn't it?

04:25:27.920 --> 04:25:29.920
Looks like it!

04:25:29.920 --> 04:25:31.920
Maybe we better get out of here!

04:25:31.920 --> 04:25:33.920
You're right! Stop!

04:25:33.920 --> 04:25:35.920
You two little thieves! Give me back my bread at once!

04:25:35.920 --> 04:25:37.920
No!

04:25:37.920 --> 04:25:39.920
Yeah!

04:25:39.920 --> 04:25:41.920
You have your own broom!

04:25:41.920 --> 04:25:43.920
You witches should learn how to share!

04:25:43.920 --> 04:25:45.920
But it's not the one who's just a spare!

04:25:45.920 --> 04:25:47.920
I want my veil from back right now!

04:25:47.920 --> 04:25:49.920
Finders, keepers, it's my broom!

04:25:49.920 --> 04:25:51.920
Cut out a broom?

04:25:51.920 --> 04:25:53.920
Huh! Why don't you take a closer look at it?

04:25:53.920 --> 04:25:55.920
That's not a broom, huh?

04:25:55.920 --> 04:25:57.920
What do you mean this is not a broom?

04:25:57.920 --> 04:25:59.920
Oh!

04:26:01.920 --> 04:26:03.920
Oh!

04:26:03.920 --> 04:26:05.920
Oh!

04:26:05.920 --> 04:26:07.920
Oh, little boy!

04:26:07.920 --> 04:26:09.920
Hey!

04:26:09.920 --> 04:26:11.920
Little boy!

04:26:11.920 --> 04:26:13.920
You're right, little boy!

04:26:13.920 --> 04:26:15.920
Little boy, isn't he, or a little boy?

04:26:15.920 --> 04:26:17.920
Oh! Oh!

04:26:17.920 --> 04:26:19.920
I must have been dreaming!

04:26:19.920 --> 04:26:21.920
You were yelling out loud!

04:26:21.920 --> 04:26:23.920
Oh, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to wake you up, Snorkman!

04:26:23.920 --> 04:26:25.920
Can you see anything?

04:26:25.920 --> 04:26:27.920
Only snow!

04:26:27.920 --> 04:26:29.920
Everything's so light!

04:26:29.920 --> 04:26:31.920
Yes, the moon is up!

04:26:31.920 --> 04:26:33.920
Oh, what an eerie light!

04:26:33.920 --> 04:26:35.920
Yes!

04:26:35.920 --> 04:26:37.920
Spring hasn't arrived yet, has it?

04:26:37.920 --> 04:26:39.920
Not yet!

04:26:39.920 --> 04:26:41.920
Everybody else is still asleep then?

04:26:41.920 --> 04:26:43.920
Yes, most of them anyway!

04:26:43.920 --> 04:26:45.920
Wonder if my brother's still up!

04:26:45.920 --> 04:26:47.920
Well, he did say before we started hyprinating

04:26:47.920 --> 04:26:49.920
he wanted to finish his blooper!

04:26:49.920 --> 04:26:51.920
Before spring, if he could!

04:26:51.920 --> 04:26:53.920
I hope he'll succeed this time!

04:26:53.920 --> 04:26:55.920
When he go out!

04:26:55.920 --> 04:26:57.920
Huh?

04:26:57.920 --> 04:26:59.920
Outside, just to see what the snow looks like!

04:26:59.920 --> 04:27:01.920
Oh, no!

04:27:01.920 --> 04:27:03.920
I don't really feel like it!

04:27:03.920 --> 04:27:05.920
It's nice and warm here!

04:27:05.920 --> 04:27:09.920
Why don't we sleep till spring like the others?

04:27:09.920 --> 04:27:13.920
Spring is still a long way off!

04:27:13.920 --> 04:27:15.920
Guess you're right!

04:27:15.920 --> 04:27:17.920
It is nice and warm in here!

04:27:17.920 --> 04:27:19.920
It is nice and warm in here!

04:27:19.920 --> 04:27:21.920
I don't really feel like it!

04:27:21.920 --> 04:27:23.920
It is nice and warm in here!

04:27:23.920 --> 04:27:25.920
Spring is still a long way off!

04:27:25.920 --> 04:27:27.920
Spring is still a long way off!

04:27:27.920 --> 04:27:29.920
Spring is still a long way off!

04:27:29.920 --> 04:27:31.920
Spring is still a long way off!

04:27:31.920 --> 04:27:33.920
Spring is still a long way off!

04:27:33.920 --> 04:27:35.920
There!

04:27:35.920 --> 04:27:39.920
It's delicious chocolate cakes my favorite!

04:27:39.920 --> 04:27:41.920
Yes, I like it!

04:27:41.920 --> 04:27:43.920
Did you say something, Snorkman?

04:27:43.920 --> 04:27:45.920
I'm so very hungry moment!

04:27:45.920 --> 04:27:54.920
Your mother's raspberry juice is really the best.

04:27:54.920 --> 04:27:57.920
It is, isn't it? Everybody said that last winter too.

04:27:57.920 --> 04:27:58.920
Hey, Moonman.

04:27:58.920 --> 04:27:59.920
Yeah?

04:27:59.920 --> 04:28:02.920
I have a funny feeling. Someone is watching us and I don't like you.

04:28:02.920 --> 04:28:03.920
One little bit.

04:28:03.920 --> 04:28:05.920
Moonman Papa could explain it.

04:28:05.920 --> 04:28:06.920
I'm sure.

04:28:06.920 --> 04:28:07.920
Of course someone's watching.

04:28:07.920 --> 04:28:09.920
What the hell? And how do you know?

04:28:09.920 --> 04:28:12.920
Too thick. He told me all about it last winter snort maiden.

04:28:12.920 --> 04:28:17.920
She doesn't hibernate, you know. She lives in our bathhouse and watches over us in the winter.

04:28:17.920 --> 04:28:21.920
She said that many things are too shy to show themselves.

04:28:21.920 --> 04:28:23.920
Oh, have you seen them yourself?

04:28:23.920 --> 04:28:26.920
Sort of. Except they were invisible, of course.

04:28:26.920 --> 04:28:28.920
Like under the sink.

04:28:28.920 --> 04:28:30.920
Or in the clock, maybe.

04:28:30.920 --> 04:28:35.920
In the empty fireplace and other dark corners of the room, I can feel it.

04:28:35.920 --> 04:28:38.920
Did you actually look anywhere for them?

04:28:38.920 --> 04:28:40.920
Oh, no. They'd be very upset.

04:28:40.920 --> 04:28:43.920
It's better not to let them know we know where they are.

04:28:43.920 --> 04:28:45.920
I wonder what these things look like.

04:28:45.920 --> 04:28:48.920
Some of them look very much like us, too, Tiki said.

04:28:48.920 --> 04:28:51.920
Old ancestors of ours from way back, she thinks.

04:28:51.920 --> 04:28:53.920
Some of them look like us, she said.

04:28:53.920 --> 04:28:55.920
Well, I've never seen them for myself.

04:28:55.920 --> 04:28:58.920
I wonder if there is good looking as we are.

04:29:03.920 --> 04:29:06.920
Wouldn't it be a good idea to stay up and wait for the sunrise?

04:29:06.920 --> 04:29:08.920
A great idea.

04:29:11.920 --> 04:29:20.920
Now, don't say anything to scare them, but this is one of the movement's ancestors from way back.

04:29:22.920 --> 04:29:24.920
Is it morning already?

04:29:24.920 --> 04:29:25.920
Are you sure?

04:29:25.920 --> 04:29:26.920
I think so.

04:29:26.920 --> 04:29:28.920
There are no clouds, so why can't we see the sun?

04:29:28.920 --> 04:29:32.920
I guess maybe the sun doesn't come up at all this time of the year.

04:29:32.920 --> 04:29:37.920
Mom and I don't like this. I don't like your one little bit.

04:29:38.920 --> 04:29:41.920
You silly little girl, what do you need this for?

04:29:41.920 --> 04:29:44.920
Please grandma, I won't be long, I promise.

04:29:44.920 --> 04:29:47.920
What are you talking about is if you could fly a broom,

04:29:47.920 --> 04:29:49.920
get back back to me at once.

04:29:49.920 --> 04:29:51.920
No, I won't give it back.

04:29:51.920 --> 04:29:53.920
Now give me back that broom and don't be silly.

04:29:53.920 --> 04:29:56.920
How many times from sight tell you you can't go visiting Moomin Valley?

04:29:56.920 --> 04:29:58.920
But it's so boring here.

04:29:58.920 --> 04:30:00.920
I want some company grandma.

04:30:01.920 --> 04:30:03.920
Come on, broom fly off.

04:30:03.920 --> 04:30:05.920
Take me to Moomin Valley.

04:30:08.920 --> 04:30:12.920
Help me up grandma, please.

04:30:14.920 --> 04:30:17.920
All right, my girl, I'll help you up, shall I?

04:30:22.920 --> 04:30:24.920
I don't believe it, I'm floating.

04:30:27.920 --> 04:30:30.920
How far? This is great.

04:30:30.920 --> 04:30:31.920
Wait.

04:30:31.920 --> 04:30:33.920
Oh, I'm falling.

04:30:38.920 --> 04:30:40.920
Oh, how about that?

04:30:40.920 --> 04:30:42.920
I'll find a bird around here.

04:30:44.920 --> 04:30:47.920
Or to bury things again, how about this?

04:30:47.920 --> 04:30:50.920
Oh no, stop the broom grandma, please.

04:30:51.920 --> 04:30:54.920
Come on, you wanted to ride on the broom, didn't you?

04:30:54.920 --> 04:30:55.920
You first saw the bike?

04:30:55.920 --> 04:30:56.920
Well, we did.

04:30:59.920 --> 04:31:01.920
Mom, please don't.

04:31:07.920 --> 04:31:10.920
If you want to learn to fly on this broom, Alicia,

04:31:10.920 --> 04:31:12.920
then forget all about those dreaded Moomin's

04:31:12.920 --> 04:31:14.920
and really start studying.

04:31:14.920 --> 04:31:16.920
It's hard work, you know, young woman.

04:31:16.920 --> 04:31:18.920
You must learn to concentrate.

04:31:24.920 --> 04:31:25.920
Hey, you up there.

04:31:25.920 --> 04:31:27.920
Are you making fun of me, too?

04:31:33.920 --> 04:31:35.920
Oh, I can't climb down there.

04:31:35.920 --> 04:31:37.920
Of course you can, even if you fall.

04:31:37.920 --> 04:31:40.920
You can't hurt yourself on this soft snow.

04:31:40.920 --> 04:31:42.920
Don't shake the ladder, Moomin.

04:31:42.920 --> 04:31:43.920
This is scary.

04:31:43.920 --> 04:31:45.920
Slowly does it.

04:31:45.920 --> 04:31:47.920
Take it easy and don't look down.

04:31:47.920 --> 04:31:50.920
Maybe going out wasn't such a good idea after all.

04:31:50.920 --> 04:31:53.920
We can always change our minds and go back to sleep, you know.

04:31:53.920 --> 04:31:55.920
See, you've made it.

04:31:55.920 --> 04:31:58.920
It's very cool though to hear Moomin, but I rather like it.

04:32:01.920 --> 04:32:04.920
Oh, this is the roof over the front door, isn't it?

04:32:04.920 --> 04:32:07.920
Yes, and everything will be snowed up now to spring.

04:32:07.920 --> 04:32:10.920
Oh no, what's happened to our firewood?

04:32:15.920 --> 04:32:16.920
What's the matter?

04:32:16.920 --> 04:32:18.920
There's not much wood left in here.

04:32:18.920 --> 04:32:20.920
Someone else must be burning it.

04:32:20.920 --> 04:32:23.920
Yes, but who and for what I wonder?

04:32:25.920 --> 04:32:26.920
I can feel it.

04:32:26.920 --> 04:32:27.920
We're not alone in this forest.

04:32:27.920 --> 04:32:29.920
I'm sure someone's watching us.

04:32:29.920 --> 04:32:31.920
All those winter creatures.

04:32:31.920 --> 04:32:33.920
No, I don't think it's them.

04:32:35.920 --> 04:32:37.920
The grog.

04:32:42.920 --> 04:32:46.920
Goodness me, look how big she gets in the wintertime.

04:32:46.920 --> 04:32:49.920
Moomin, I'm scared.

04:32:49.920 --> 04:32:51.920
It'll be all right.

04:32:51.920 --> 04:32:54.920
Grog, stop right there.

04:32:56.920 --> 04:32:58.920
Don't come any closer if you please.

04:32:58.920 --> 04:33:01.920
You're much, much too cold for us, you see.

04:33:01.920 --> 04:33:03.920
You could freeze a stiff, you know.

04:33:05.920 --> 04:33:09.920
Oh, is it possible that you get lonely all by yourself?

04:33:11.920 --> 04:33:14.920
I don't think there's anything we can do to help you know,

04:33:14.920 --> 04:33:18.920
not without fur coats and earmuffs and worn gloves anyway.

04:33:18.920 --> 04:33:19.920
We must go.

04:33:35.920 --> 04:33:37.920
Someone's been stealing our firewood.

04:33:37.920 --> 04:33:39.920
I wonder what they're doing with it.

04:33:39.920 --> 04:33:42.920
Something bad, there's no doubt about that.

04:33:42.920 --> 04:33:45.920
Must've been several people did this.

04:33:46.920 --> 04:33:48.920
We had a lot of fun here in the summer.

04:33:48.920 --> 04:33:49.920
Remember?

04:33:49.920 --> 04:33:52.920
Well, the she is still here round the ice.

04:33:52.920 --> 04:33:53.920
I hope.

04:33:53.920 --> 04:33:56.920
Too, Tiki! Too, Tiki!

04:34:15.920 --> 04:34:16.920
There's no one here.

04:34:16.920 --> 04:34:17.920
Are you sure?

04:34:17.920 --> 04:34:18.920
Look for yourself.

04:34:21.920 --> 04:34:24.920
I know they're invisible, but I'm a shroom ice in here.

04:34:24.920 --> 04:34:27.920
Hard to tell, with things you can't see.

04:34:28.920 --> 04:34:30.920
Oh, what is it?

04:34:30.920 --> 04:34:33.920
It felt like something scampering on my back.

04:34:33.920 --> 04:34:36.920
That's all right, it must be one of the shroom ice.

04:34:40.920 --> 04:34:42.920
Moomin, Moomin.

04:34:43.920 --> 04:34:46.920
Oh, where could he have gone?

04:34:48.920 --> 04:34:52.920
My goodness, I've never seen anything quite like this before.

04:34:52.920 --> 04:34:54.920
Hi, it's good to see you.

04:34:54.920 --> 04:34:56.920
You're right, she's fishing.

04:34:56.920 --> 04:34:57.920
Hi, too, Tiki!

04:34:57.920 --> 04:34:59.920
Hello, too, Tiki!

04:34:59.920 --> 04:35:02.920
So this winter's not made in woke up too, huh?

04:35:02.920 --> 04:35:04.920
I walk her up by mistake.

04:35:04.920 --> 04:35:07.920
You know that spring is still a long way off, don't you?

04:35:07.920 --> 04:35:10.920
I thought it might be seeing there's no sun at all.

04:35:10.920 --> 04:35:13.920
But the sun is gonna come back tomorrow, Moomin.

04:35:13.920 --> 04:35:14.920
Tomorrow?

04:35:14.920 --> 04:35:17.920
It's Northmaiden was so worried about the sun not showing.

04:35:17.920 --> 04:35:21.920
The sun will rise tomorrow, Moomin, but it'll go down very soon.

04:35:21.920 --> 04:35:25.920
Too, Tiki, you know, I think there must be records in Moomin Valley.

04:35:25.920 --> 04:35:27.920
Records in winter?

04:35:27.920 --> 04:35:30.920
There's an enormous pile of firewood up on the hillside.

04:35:30.920 --> 04:35:34.920
Oh, I know, it took a long time to collect that wood.

04:35:34.920 --> 04:35:36.920
But some of it belongs to us.

04:35:36.920 --> 04:35:39.920
Hmm, that doesn't really surprise me, though, Moomin.

04:35:39.920 --> 04:35:43.920
I'm afraid the winter creatures aren't very careful about ownership.

04:35:43.920 --> 04:35:46.920
They need a lot, so if they see it, they take it.

04:35:46.920 --> 04:35:48.920
It's for their big winter bonfire.

04:35:48.920 --> 04:35:49.920
A bonfire?

04:35:49.920 --> 04:35:53.920
Yes, and now your firewood can take part in the big celebration.

04:35:53.920 --> 04:35:57.920
They light it every winter to make sure the sun comes back, you know.

04:35:57.920 --> 04:36:01.920
Oh, you mean otherwise the sun wouldn't come back, Tiki?

04:36:01.920 --> 04:36:06.920
Well, since they always light it on this day, you don't really know, do you?

04:36:06.920 --> 04:36:08.920
Tonight you might see the winter creatures.

04:36:08.920 --> 04:36:11.920
Okay, we come along as well, Tiki.

04:36:11.920 --> 04:36:12.920
Yes, you can.

04:36:12.920 --> 04:36:15.920
If you sit quietly and don't scare them in any way.

04:36:15.920 --> 04:36:17.920
Wonderful. You're coming along, too, aren't you?

04:36:17.920 --> 04:36:19.920
It, of course.

04:36:19.920 --> 04:36:21.920
Stop! Help me!

04:36:21.920 --> 04:36:23.920
Someone shouting for help?

04:36:23.920 --> 04:36:24.920
Who could it be?

04:36:24.920 --> 04:36:27.920
Go away! Get away from me!

04:36:27.920 --> 04:36:30.920
I didn't do it on purpose! I didn't mean any harm!

04:36:30.920 --> 04:36:34.920
If you don't leave me alone, Grandma will turn you into a toad!

04:36:34.920 --> 04:36:37.920
Oh, that's so cold! Go away, please!

04:36:37.920 --> 04:36:41.920
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

04:36:45.920 --> 04:36:47.920
Grow! Leave her alone!

04:36:47.920 --> 04:36:49.920
What are you doing, Grog?

04:36:52.920 --> 04:36:53.920
Move, man!

04:36:53.920 --> 04:36:54.920
Alicia!

04:36:54.920 --> 04:36:57.920
Now listen, Grog, why can't you be nice to her?

04:36:57.920 --> 04:36:58.920
Alicia is one of my friends.

04:36:58.920 --> 04:37:02.920
She was just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis.

04:37:02.920 --> 04:37:05.920
I nearly bumped into her, but I didn't touch her.

04:37:05.920 --> 04:37:06.920
That's all right, Alicia.

04:37:06.920 --> 04:37:08.920
Tell me, Grog, what's gotten into you?

04:37:08.920 --> 04:37:10.920
Why are you so nasty to such a sweet little girl?

04:37:10.920 --> 04:37:12.920
It isn't like you at all.

04:37:12.920 --> 04:37:18.920
I must have startled her, I guess, and I didn't apologize at all, but it made no difference.

04:37:18.920 --> 04:37:20.920
This is really, very odd.

04:37:20.920 --> 04:37:24.920
Then I asked if she had seen you, and that's when she started to get mad at me.

04:37:24.920 --> 04:37:26.920
And she doesn't even know me.

04:37:26.920 --> 04:37:27.920
It's a mystery.

04:37:27.920 --> 04:37:30.920
Whatever's the matter with you, Grog.

04:37:30.920 --> 04:37:32.920
Whoa!

04:37:44.920 --> 04:37:46.920
Oh, I was so scared.

04:37:46.920 --> 04:37:48.920
I'm so glad you've come to see us.

04:37:48.920 --> 04:37:50.920
So am I, women.

04:37:50.920 --> 04:37:53.920
Somehow I felt certain you hadn't gone into hibernation yet.

04:37:53.920 --> 04:37:56.920
But what did your grandmother say?

04:37:56.920 --> 04:37:59.920
Nothing because I didn't tell her I was coming.

04:37:59.920 --> 04:38:01.920
Thank you for chasing off that terrible monster.

04:38:01.920 --> 04:38:04.920
The Grog hasn't actually ever attacked anyone.

04:38:04.920 --> 04:38:07.920
Well, maybe she doesn't like the look of Alicia.

04:38:07.920 --> 04:38:09.920
Snork maiden.

04:38:09.920 --> 04:38:12.920
It's really a mystery to me why the Grog was here at all.

04:38:12.920 --> 04:38:15.920
She was here looking for a moment no doubt.

04:38:15.920 --> 04:38:16.920
Was she?

04:38:16.920 --> 04:38:19.920
He suddenly become very popular.

04:38:19.920 --> 04:38:20.920
Huh?

04:38:20.920 --> 04:38:22.920
You don't mean...

04:38:22.920 --> 04:38:28.920
What's the matter with you?

04:38:28.920 --> 04:38:31.920
I think the Grog may have fallen in love with you, woman.

04:38:31.920 --> 04:38:32.920
What?

04:38:32.920 --> 04:38:34.920
Oh, you can't mean that.

04:38:34.920 --> 04:38:36.920
Please tell me you're not serious.

04:38:36.920 --> 04:38:38.920
It's out of the question.

04:38:38.920 --> 04:38:39.920
It's her ridiculous idea.

04:38:39.920 --> 04:38:41.920
Don't be so silly.

04:38:41.920 --> 04:39:01.920
Where is all that drumming noise coming from?

04:39:01.920 --> 04:39:11.640
Where's all that drumming noise coming from?

04:39:11.640 --> 04:39:14.440
From the invisible shroom ice.

04:39:14.440 --> 04:39:16.480
How long before everybody arrives?

04:39:16.480 --> 04:39:19.480
Oh, they're here already, Moomin, all around us.

04:39:19.480 --> 04:39:20.480
They are?

04:39:20.480 --> 04:39:21.480
Where?

04:39:21.480 --> 04:39:22.480
I can't see them.

04:39:22.480 --> 04:39:24.720
Are they really invisible?

04:39:24.720 --> 04:39:29.680
I can't see them either, but I can feel their presence all around me.

04:39:30.080 --> 04:39:33.400
But she's been studying witchcraft, hasn't she?

04:39:33.400 --> 04:39:38.400
I'm sure you and Moomin will be able to feel their presence quite soon.

04:40:00.680 --> 04:40:01.680
Oh!

04:40:21.680 --> 04:40:25.680
I can see some of them looking all over there.

04:40:30.680 --> 04:40:31.680
Oh!

04:40:35.680 --> 04:40:38.680
I can't see them, too, you guys.

04:40:43.680 --> 04:40:46.680
Dootie, can you tell me why can't we see all of them?

04:40:46.680 --> 04:40:48.680
Well, we can never see them all.

04:40:48.680 --> 04:40:52.680
I don't understand how did you know earlier on the shroom ice were playing the drums.

04:40:52.680 --> 04:40:56.680
I just know because they sometimes play them in the batch house as well.

04:40:56.680 --> 04:40:58.680
What a wonderful celebration.

04:40:58.680 --> 04:41:03.680
Isn't it lucky I came over here if I had not had missed a most memorable evening?

04:41:18.680 --> 04:41:20.680
What's going on here?

04:41:20.680 --> 04:41:22.680
The grog.

04:41:22.680 --> 04:41:23.680
What?

04:41:24.680 --> 04:41:28.680
What's she going on here?

04:41:28.680 --> 04:41:32.680
She must be looking for Moomin again, I guess.

04:41:32.680 --> 04:41:35.680
No, I think she just wants to warm herself by the fire.

04:41:36.680 --> 04:41:39.680
But what's she doing?

04:42:00.680 --> 04:42:04.680
Well, that's the end of the midwinter bonfire.

04:42:04.680 --> 04:42:05.680
Pull, grog.

04:42:05.680 --> 04:42:07.680
She freezes everything she touches.

04:42:07.680 --> 04:42:13.680
Whatever she sits on, even the hottest bonfire turns freezing cold in a matter of seconds.

04:42:13.680 --> 04:42:17.680
Well, at least she's managed to save some of our wood.

04:42:25.680 --> 04:42:29.680
Don't hold on tight now, Snorkemaid, and I'm be careful.

04:42:29.680 --> 04:42:32.680
I can't wait to get into bed.

04:42:32.680 --> 04:42:35.680
I wanted to stay up until the sun came up again.

04:42:35.680 --> 04:42:38.680
But I don't know if I could keep awake till then.

04:42:38.680 --> 04:42:41.680
So long till spring then, Moomin.

04:42:41.680 --> 04:42:43.680
Goodbye.

04:42:43.680 --> 04:42:45.680
And take care, Alicia.

04:42:45.680 --> 04:42:47.680
I will, Moomin.

04:42:47.680 --> 04:42:50.680
The moon will light my way back.

04:43:02.680 --> 04:43:05.680
This time, the Moomin's have gone too far.

04:43:05.680 --> 04:43:06.680
Something must be done.

04:43:06.680 --> 04:43:09.680
I'll teach them a lesson they'll never forget.

04:43:09.680 --> 04:43:12.680
They won't get the better at me.

04:43:12.680 --> 04:43:17.680
Now, what does the witch mean by teach them a lesson?

04:43:17.680 --> 04:43:20.680
That sounds very ominous.

04:43:20.680 --> 04:43:24.680
Let's hope at least that she lets them sleep till next spring.

04:43:32.680 --> 04:43:35.680
Moomin.

04:44:02.680 --> 04:44:05.680
Moomin.

04:44:05.680 --> 04:44:08.680
Moomin.

04:44:08.680 --> 04:44:11.680
Moomin.

04:44:11.680 --> 04:44:14.680
Moomin.

04:44:32.680 --> 04:44:35.680
Moomin.

04:44:35.680 --> 04:44:38.680
Here they are for one and all.

04:44:38.680 --> 04:44:41.680
The Moomin's are about to call.

04:44:41.680 --> 04:44:44.680
Come on and sit down here with me.

04:44:44.680 --> 04:44:46.680
Therefore you are your TV.

04:44:46.680 --> 04:44:49.680
They are the Moomin's.

04:44:49.680 --> 04:44:52.680
They are the Moomin's.

04:44:52.680 --> 04:44:55.680
So come with me, give me your hand.

04:44:55.680 --> 04:44:58.680
I'll take you up to Moomin land.

04:44:58.680 --> 04:45:01.680
You can fly just like a bird.

04:45:01.680 --> 04:45:04.680
Sing that song ever.

04:45:04.680 --> 04:45:06.680
There were the Moomin's.

04:45:06.680 --> 04:45:12.680
There were the Moomin's.

04:45:12.680 --> 04:45:15.680
There were the Moomin's.

04:45:15.680 --> 04:45:18.680
There were the Moomin's.

04:45:18.680 --> 04:45:22.680
There were the Moomin's.

04:45:31.680 --> 04:46:01.680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

04:46:01.680 --> 04:46:31.680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

04:46:31.680 --> 04:46:36.080
But right now.

04:46:36.080 --> 04:46:38.580
The witch has come to Moomin Valley.

04:46:38.580 --> 04:46:41.080
What could she be up to this time?

04:46:41.080 --> 04:46:44.160
Eldregrapala Zoom! Eldregrapala Zoom!

04:46:44.160 --> 04:46:46.880
Eldregrapala Zoom! Eldregrapala Zoom!

04:46:46.880 --> 04:46:52.720
Eldregrapala Zoom! Jazzy Shrimp!

04:46:52.720 --> 04:46:57.460
Eldregrapala Zoom! Eldregrapala Zoom!

04:46:57.460 --> 04:46:59.460
He'll just come out as old!

04:47:02.020 --> 04:47:05.260
Always snowing again. I must get a covered brown.

04:47:27.460 --> 04:47:36.460
The great thaw had come at last.

04:47:42.460 --> 04:47:44.460
The Moomin Valley.

04:47:49.460 --> 04:47:51.460
I think I can smell spring!

04:47:52.460 --> 04:47:56.460
Oh, I've never seen anything like this one before.

04:48:04.460 --> 04:48:06.460
Hello there, Mr. Hemielun.

04:48:06.460 --> 04:48:09.460
Hello, Sniff. You're up early this year?

04:48:09.460 --> 04:48:12.460
Yes. I think I've even beat Moomin to it.

04:48:12.460 --> 04:48:16.460
Is that so? Why are the Moomin so late this year?

04:48:22.460 --> 04:48:27.460
Moomin, wake up! Spring is here! It's time to wake up!

04:48:27.460 --> 04:48:28.460
Moomin!

04:48:29.460 --> 04:48:32.460
Maybe Snork Maiden's easier to wake up.

04:48:32.460 --> 04:48:34.460
Snork Maiden!

04:48:35.460 --> 04:48:39.460
And I thought I was difficult to wake up. I must get closer.

04:48:39.460 --> 04:48:40.460
Yes.

04:48:49.460 --> 04:48:51.460
What are you doing, Sniff?

04:48:51.460 --> 04:48:53.460
What am I doing? You can see, can't you?

04:48:53.460 --> 04:48:55.460
Of course I can, but why are you climbing up that?

04:48:55.460 --> 04:48:58.460
Moomin and Snork Maiden are still asleep. I have to wake them up.

04:48:58.460 --> 04:49:02.460
Why don't you go this way? It's easier!

04:49:03.460 --> 04:49:05.460
What are you doing?

04:49:11.460 --> 04:49:14.460
Funny, even Moomin Mama's still asleep.

04:49:19.460 --> 04:49:21.460
Wrong room.

04:49:23.460 --> 04:49:26.460
Come on! Wake up, lazy bones!

04:49:27.460 --> 04:49:29.460
Moomin, spring has come!

04:49:37.460 --> 04:49:40.460
We'll look at that! Wake up, you sleepyhead!

04:49:40.460 --> 04:49:43.460
Oh, you really are impossible!

04:49:43.460 --> 04:49:47.460
Moomin, Moomin, Moomin! This is odd, even for Moomin!

04:49:50.460 --> 04:49:52.460
Open the window, little mind!

04:49:57.460 --> 04:50:01.460
Oh, was I scared?

04:50:02.460 --> 04:50:05.460
Oh, I haven't you opened them up!

04:50:05.460 --> 04:50:07.460
I've tried, but they won't!

04:50:08.460 --> 04:50:10.460
You're kidding!

04:50:12.460 --> 04:50:14.460
No one can resist this little mind!

04:50:15.460 --> 04:50:18.460
Wake up, Moomin! I know you're ticklish!

04:50:21.460 --> 04:50:23.460
Moomin, Moomin!

04:50:23.460 --> 04:50:25.460
I told you so!

04:50:27.460 --> 04:50:31.460
Moomin, come on!

04:50:42.460 --> 04:50:44.460
How strange!

04:50:44.460 --> 04:50:46.460
How sad!

04:50:46.460 --> 04:50:47.460
What do you mean?

04:50:47.460 --> 04:50:49.460
I think...

04:50:51.460 --> 04:50:54.460
It's hard to tell. I was listening for a heartbeat.

04:50:56.460 --> 04:50:58.460
He's still breathing.

04:50:59.460 --> 04:51:01.460
And Snork made it?

04:51:02.460 --> 04:51:05.460
Wake up, you slug of it!

04:51:05.460 --> 04:51:07.460
Snork made it!

04:51:08.460 --> 04:51:10.460
They won't wake up!

04:51:10.460 --> 04:51:11.460
This is strange!

04:51:11.460 --> 04:51:13.460
Why don't we go and try the other?

04:51:13.460 --> 04:51:14.460
Yes, why not?

04:51:14.460 --> 04:51:17.460
I hate it when others are asleep while I'm up.

04:51:17.460 --> 04:51:21.460
But then I don't like it much the other way around either, do I, Snip?

04:51:22.460 --> 04:51:24.460
Moomin, pop up, please wake up!

04:51:24.460 --> 04:51:26.460
We've tried to wake up, Moomin, but he won't!

04:51:26.460 --> 04:51:28.460
Wakey, Moomin!

04:51:28.460 --> 04:51:30.460
Mama breakfast time!

04:51:30.460 --> 04:51:32.460
Come on, Moomin, pop up!

04:51:32.460 --> 04:51:34.460
Wake up!

04:51:34.460 --> 04:51:36.460
This is no use!

04:51:44.460 --> 04:51:47.460
Goodness, it seems the Moomin's are still hibernating.

04:51:47.460 --> 04:51:49.460
And so is Snork Maiden.

04:51:49.460 --> 04:51:52.460
That's odd. She always wakes up even before me.

04:51:52.460 --> 04:51:56.460
Oh, Moomin, too, but this year it seems to be different.

04:51:56.460 --> 04:51:59.460
I'll go back home, and I'll come over again in a little while

04:51:59.460 --> 04:52:01.460
when the Moomin family will have woken up.

04:52:01.460 --> 04:52:03.460
If they ever do.

04:52:03.460 --> 04:52:04.460
Huh?

04:52:04.460 --> 04:52:06.460
We've tried everything to wake them up,

04:52:06.460 --> 04:52:08.460
short of buckets of water, and there's no moving them.

04:52:08.460 --> 04:52:12.460
We've shouted and shook and pinched and tickled and stopped!

04:52:12.460 --> 04:52:13.460
Oh, dear!

04:52:13.460 --> 04:52:15.460
It's not just strange, it's ominous.

04:52:15.460 --> 04:52:17.460
Oh, my, surely not.

04:52:18.460 --> 04:52:20.460
Hello, everybody.

04:52:20.460 --> 04:52:22.460
How is everyone?

04:52:22.460 --> 04:52:23.460
What is it?

04:52:23.460 --> 04:52:26.460
You all look very scared.

04:52:26.460 --> 04:52:28.460
Huh?

04:52:28.460 --> 04:52:31.460
Still hibernating?

04:52:34.460 --> 04:52:37.460
It's all very strange, habulin.

04:52:38.460 --> 04:52:40.460
Moomin!

04:52:40.460 --> 04:52:41.460
See?

04:52:41.460 --> 04:52:43.460
Yes, indeed.

04:52:44.460 --> 04:52:48.460
How we can really do is wait and see.

04:52:48.460 --> 04:52:50.460
I suppose you're right.

04:52:50.460 --> 04:52:53.460
Don't worry, the days are getting longer all the time now,

04:52:53.460 --> 04:52:55.460
so the Moomin's can't sleep much longer.

04:52:55.460 --> 04:52:57.460
And Snork Maiden?

04:52:57.460 --> 04:53:00.460
Cheat too, of course.

04:53:00.460 --> 04:53:03.460
Bet you anything Moomin wakes up when Snuffkin returns.

04:53:03.460 --> 04:53:05.460
I think you're right, Sniff.

04:53:05.460 --> 04:53:09.460
And then, one day about a week later,

04:53:09.460 --> 04:53:14.460
Snuffkin did come back from his yearly trip south.

04:53:15.460 --> 04:53:17.460
Snuffkin!

04:53:37.460 --> 04:53:39.460
Snuffkin!

04:53:45.460 --> 04:53:47.460
Snuffkin!

04:53:50.460 --> 04:53:52.460
Snuffkin!

04:53:52.460 --> 04:53:54.460
Snuffkin!

04:54:15.460 --> 04:54:17.460
Where's Moomin?

04:54:17.460 --> 04:54:19.460
He's in bed.

04:54:19.460 --> 04:54:21.460
Moomin's still asleep.

04:54:21.460 --> 04:54:23.460
A sleep.

04:54:31.460 --> 04:54:34.460
They won't wake up no matter what you do.

04:54:34.460 --> 04:54:37.460
What do you think, Snuffkin?

04:54:37.460 --> 04:54:39.460
I think they're very sick.

04:54:39.460 --> 04:54:41.460
That's a possibility.

04:54:41.460 --> 04:54:43.460
Sleeping sickness, perhaps?

04:54:43.460 --> 04:54:45.460
It's very difficult to say.

04:54:45.460 --> 04:54:47.460
To me, though, if you want my honest opinion,

04:54:47.460 --> 04:54:50.460
I think somebody has cast a very nasty spell on them.

04:54:50.460 --> 04:54:52.460
A spell?

04:54:52.460 --> 04:54:54.460
But who would do that?

04:54:54.460 --> 04:54:56.460
I think I know.

04:54:56.460 --> 04:54:57.460
Huh?

04:54:57.460 --> 04:54:58.460
You mean the witch?

04:54:58.460 --> 04:55:00.460
Alice is grandmother, but why?

04:55:00.460 --> 04:55:03.460
To tell you the truth, I haven't the biggest idea.

04:55:03.460 --> 04:55:06.460
How do we find out?

04:55:06.460 --> 04:55:09.460
I'll go to the forest and see her.

04:55:09.460 --> 04:55:12.460
And if she did cast a spell, do you think she'd tell you?

04:55:12.460 --> 04:55:15.460
I really don't know, but we have to do something.

04:55:15.460 --> 04:55:18.460
We can't just leave them sleeping here forever.

04:55:18.460 --> 04:55:20.460
I'll go with you.

04:55:20.460 --> 04:55:23.460
I guess I'd better stay here to take care of things.

04:55:23.460 --> 04:55:27.460
Well, if they suddenly wake up, somebody needs to be here.

04:55:27.460 --> 04:55:29.460
Snuffkin.

04:55:29.460 --> 04:55:30.460
Huh?

04:55:30.460 --> 04:55:31.460
That's him!

04:55:31.460 --> 04:55:32.460
At last!

04:55:32.460 --> 04:55:33.460
Moomin!

04:55:33.460 --> 04:55:34.460
Moomin!

04:55:34.460 --> 04:55:35.460
Moomin!

04:55:37.460 --> 04:55:39.460
He's dreaming.

04:55:39.460 --> 04:55:42.460
It makes me feel sleepy.

04:55:43.460 --> 04:55:48.460
Moomin, I promise to get this horrible spell cast off for you.

04:56:10.460 --> 04:56:12.460
Hush.

04:56:23.460 --> 04:56:25.460
Where are you going?

04:56:25.460 --> 04:56:29.460
I've done all the chores, even washed out your old potion jars.

04:56:29.460 --> 04:56:31.460
So where are you going?

04:56:31.460 --> 04:56:32.460
Spring is here, Grandma.

04:56:32.460 --> 04:56:35.460
I thought I'd take some time off to celebrate.

04:56:35.460 --> 04:56:37.460
But what about your work?

04:56:37.460 --> 04:56:40.460
I'm just going out for the day, Grandma.

04:56:40.460 --> 04:56:42.460
And I know where.

04:56:42.460 --> 04:56:44.460
I only want to see the Moomin's.

04:56:44.460 --> 04:56:45.460
They're still hibernating.

04:56:45.460 --> 04:56:46.460
No, they're not.

04:56:46.460 --> 04:56:48.460
It isn't winter anymore.

04:56:48.460 --> 04:56:52.460
Winter or spring, I happen to know the Moomin's are still asleep.

04:56:52.460 --> 04:56:55.460
How could you know what the Moomin's are up to, Grandma?

04:56:55.460 --> 04:56:56.460
Hm.

04:56:56.460 --> 04:56:58.460
Oh, which is no everything, my dear girl.

04:56:58.460 --> 04:56:59.460
Really?

04:56:59.460 --> 04:57:01.460
Well, I'll go and see.

04:57:01.460 --> 04:57:03.460
Come here.

04:57:08.460 --> 04:57:13.460
I have to admit that I can't help being worried about the Moomin's.

04:57:13.460 --> 04:57:16.460
Their windows are open for the spring.

04:57:16.460 --> 04:57:19.460
So they can smell the first spring flowers?

04:57:19.460 --> 04:57:23.460
Well, I suppose I'd miss beginning on.

04:57:27.460 --> 04:57:30.460
Why didn't you tell them about the witch in the spell?

04:57:30.460 --> 04:57:33.460
Well, after all, that was just an idea I got.

04:57:33.460 --> 04:57:36.460
Ideas can be embarrassing if you were wrong.

04:57:36.460 --> 04:57:39.460
So don't tell anyone for the time being.

04:57:39.460 --> 04:57:40.460
All right.

04:57:40.460 --> 04:57:41.460
I'm going.

04:57:43.460 --> 04:57:45.460
And I'm leaving, too.

04:57:45.460 --> 04:57:46.460
Okay.

04:57:51.460 --> 04:57:53.460
There's Alicia.

04:57:53.460 --> 04:57:55.460
Hi, everyone.

04:57:55.460 --> 04:57:56.460
It's me.

04:57:56.460 --> 04:57:58.460
Why do you get a teller?

04:57:58.460 --> 04:58:01.460
We better tell of the truth, I guess.

04:58:07.460 --> 04:58:10.460
The best thing would be for me to talk to her first.

04:58:10.460 --> 04:58:11.460
Yes, I agree.

04:58:11.460 --> 04:58:13.460
She's unbelievable.

04:58:13.460 --> 04:58:14.460
How could she?

04:58:17.460 --> 04:58:20.460
I can hardly believe you could be so mean, Grandma.

04:58:20.460 --> 04:58:22.460
Calm down, my dear.

04:58:22.460 --> 04:58:25.460
Why did it all for you, Alicia?

04:58:25.460 --> 04:58:27.460
You did it for me.

04:58:27.460 --> 04:58:29.460
If the Moomin's are asleep, why should you go there?

04:58:29.460 --> 04:58:32.460
Do them a world of good, too, along sleep.

04:58:32.460 --> 04:58:34.460
How ridiculous, Grandma, there.

04:58:34.460 --> 04:58:37.460
Alicia, you've done quite well in your studies, and if you keep at it,

04:58:37.460 --> 04:58:42.460
I see no reason why you shouldn't be a fully fledged witch before a 30.

04:58:43.460 --> 04:58:46.460
And if I do see the Moomin's, I won't be a witch till I'm 31.

04:58:46.460 --> 04:58:47.460
Is that what you mean?

04:58:47.460 --> 04:58:50.460
Now, the Moomin's are very bad influence on you.

04:58:50.460 --> 04:58:55.460
They are so disgustingly good, and if you want to be a witch, you mustn't see them.

04:58:59.460 --> 04:59:02.460
And if I promise never to go near Moomin Valley again,

04:59:02.460 --> 04:59:04.460
will you lift the spell, Grandma?

04:59:04.460 --> 04:59:07.460
Good girl, that's exactly what I wanted here.

04:59:07.460 --> 04:59:09.460
You promise me, Dan, Alicia?

04:59:09.460 --> 04:59:10.460
I promise, Grandma.

04:59:10.460 --> 04:59:12.460
Right, the spell should be lifted.

04:59:12.460 --> 04:59:13.460
Snuff head.

04:59:13.460 --> 04:59:14.460
What do you want?

04:59:14.460 --> 04:59:17.460
There are two different ways of lifting the spell I cast on the Moomin's.

04:59:17.460 --> 04:59:18.460
Uh-huh.

04:59:18.460 --> 04:59:22.460
The first one is that I go to Moomin Valley myself and chant the magic words

04:59:22.460 --> 04:59:24.460
outside their bedroom window.

04:59:24.460 --> 04:59:26.460
Oh, Grandma, that's not a good idea.

04:59:26.460 --> 04:59:31.460
Oh, oh, you mean people who might be upset about me casting a spell on the Moomin's?

04:59:31.460 --> 04:59:33.460
You may be right.

04:59:33.460 --> 04:59:37.460
So therefore, Snuff Kid, I have no choice but to ask you to perform the task.

04:59:37.460 --> 04:59:38.460
Oh.

04:59:38.460 --> 04:59:39.460
But why me?

04:59:39.460 --> 04:59:41.460
You do have your harmonica with you?

04:59:41.460 --> 04:59:42.460
Of course.

04:59:42.460 --> 04:59:44.460
Let me have it, please.

04:59:48.460 --> 04:59:49.460
Eldish Cabalasome.

04:59:49.460 --> 04:59:50.460
Eldish Cabalasome.

04:59:50.460 --> 04:59:51.460
Eldish Cabalasome.

04:59:51.460 --> 04:59:52.460
Eldish Cabalasome.

04:59:52.460 --> 04:59:53.460
Eldish Cabalasome.

04:59:53.460 --> 04:59:58.460
If you don't stop staring at me, my witchcraft won't be effective.

04:59:59.460 --> 05:00:01.460
Alicia, get me the next potion now.

05:00:01.460 --> 05:00:02.460
Oh.

05:00:03.460 --> 05:00:04.460
Oh.

05:00:04.460 --> 05:00:06.460
All right, grandmother.

05:00:10.460 --> 05:00:11.460
Eldish Cabalasome.

05:00:11.460 --> 05:00:12.460
Eldish Cabalasome.

05:00:12.460 --> 05:00:13.460
Eldish Cabalasome.

05:00:13.460 --> 05:00:14.460
Eldish Cabalasome.

05:00:14.460 --> 05:00:16.460
Oh, she can't do it if we look at her, huh?

05:00:16.460 --> 05:00:17.460
Eldish Cabalasome.

05:00:17.460 --> 05:00:18.460
Eldish Cabalasome.

05:00:18.460 --> 05:00:20.460
Now, listen, Inspector.

05:00:20.460 --> 05:00:21.460
You must do something.

05:00:21.460 --> 05:00:23.460
You are the police, aren't you?

05:00:23.460 --> 05:00:27.460
Well, I have to tell you, waking people up is not really part of our job.

05:00:27.460 --> 05:00:29.460
But you're our last hope, Inspector.

05:00:29.460 --> 05:00:31.460
You must do something.

05:00:31.460 --> 05:00:34.460
Perhaps if you could possibly use your whistle to wake them up.

05:00:34.460 --> 05:00:35.460
Uh-huh.

05:00:35.460 --> 05:00:37.460
It's very shrill indoors. Good Friday.

05:00:37.460 --> 05:00:39.460
And fire your revolver.

05:00:39.460 --> 05:00:41.460
I'm sure that would do it, Inspector.

05:00:41.460 --> 05:00:44.460
I don't carry guns. They're dangerous.

05:00:44.460 --> 05:00:46.460
Oh, dear.

05:00:51.460 --> 05:00:52.460
Hey!

05:00:52.460 --> 05:00:53.460
Snuffkin!

05:00:53.460 --> 05:00:55.460
Little Y!

05:00:55.460 --> 05:00:58.460
He sounds worried. I bet they're still fast asleep.

05:00:58.460 --> 05:00:59.460
Hmm.

05:01:03.460 --> 05:01:04.460
Right, Snuffkin?

05:01:04.460 --> 05:01:05.460
Get on with it.

05:01:06.460 --> 05:01:07.460
Hmm.

05:01:07.460 --> 05:01:09.460
Hmm.

05:01:17.460 --> 05:01:18.460
Hmm.

05:01:18.460 --> 05:01:20.460
Hmm.

05:01:20.460 --> 05:01:22.460
Hmm.

05:01:22.460 --> 05:01:23.460
Hmm.

05:01:23.460 --> 05:01:24.460
Hmm.

05:01:24.460 --> 05:01:25.460
It's not working. Is it?

05:01:25.460 --> 05:01:27.460
Get my chance, Snuffkin.

05:01:27.460 --> 05:01:28.460
Hmm.

05:01:28.460 --> 05:01:30.460
Hmm.

05:01:30.460 --> 05:01:33.460
Hmm.

05:01:33.460 --> 05:01:34.460
Hmm.

05:01:34.460 --> 05:01:44.460
Snorke! Snorke, Maiden! Wake up! Spring is here! Come on!

05:01:54.460 --> 05:01:56.460
Spring is here already!

05:01:56.460 --> 05:01:58.460
Good morning, Papa, dear!

05:01:58.460 --> 05:02:00.460
Good morning!

05:02:00.460 --> 05:02:04.460
I have a feeling we've over slept. I wonder whether the others are up yet.

05:02:04.460 --> 05:02:08.460
Oh, she's made a fool of you, Snorke!

05:02:08.460 --> 05:02:12.460
Oh, shut up, Snorke! Maybe she forgot how to cast off the spell!

05:02:12.460 --> 05:02:14.460
Hi, Snorke! Hi!

05:02:14.460 --> 05:02:16.460
Good morning!

05:02:18.460 --> 05:02:20.460
Good morning, everybody!

05:02:20.460 --> 05:02:22.460
Hi, Snorke!

05:02:24.460 --> 05:02:28.460
I'm so glad you were right back already, Snorke!

05:02:28.460 --> 05:02:32.460
You woke up early, too! Did you hear that?

05:02:32.460 --> 05:02:34.460
It's you that woke up late, women!

05:02:34.460 --> 05:02:36.460
Who me?

05:02:40.460 --> 05:02:42.460
Hmm? Ah!

05:02:42.460 --> 05:02:46.460
Now I say, women's all ready up and about!

05:02:46.460 --> 05:02:48.460
What?

05:02:48.460 --> 05:02:50.460
Oh, hi, Snorke!

05:02:50.460 --> 05:02:52.460
Oh, it's you, you're awake!

05:02:52.460 --> 05:02:54.460
I'm glad I didn't blow my whistle!

05:02:54.460 --> 05:02:56.460
But we did have a reason to be worried, Inspector!

05:02:56.460 --> 05:02:58.460
He's right! What about Mom and Mama?

05:02:58.460 --> 05:03:00.460
And Mom and Papa?

05:03:00.460 --> 05:03:02.460
Hello there, everybody!

05:03:02.460 --> 05:03:04.460
Is anything the matter?

05:03:04.460 --> 05:03:06.460
Nothing at all!

05:03:06.460 --> 05:03:08.460
They're awake! Oh, dear! I don't understand!

05:03:08.460 --> 05:03:10.460
You don't understand what?

05:03:10.460 --> 05:03:14.460
We were very worried because you just wouldn't wake up!

05:03:14.460 --> 05:03:16.460
Oh, really? You do know we always have a night, don't you?

05:03:16.460 --> 05:03:18.460
We sleep all winter, and we always wake up in the spring!

05:03:18.460 --> 05:03:22.460
Of course, of course, but this year, Snorke, you're telling!

05:03:22.460 --> 05:03:24.460
Well, we did have a bit of a problem!

05:03:24.460 --> 05:03:26.460
You see, Mom and Papa, we couldn't swim!

05:03:26.460 --> 05:03:28.460
Snorke!

05:03:28.460 --> 05:03:30.460
Back already!

05:03:30.460 --> 05:03:32.460
Why don't you listen to us, Mom and Papa?

05:03:32.460 --> 05:03:34.460
Very well!

05:03:34.460 --> 05:03:36.460
Why don't you come in and we'll have a nice cup of tea,

05:03:36.460 --> 05:03:38.460
and then we can discuss your problem properly!

05:03:38.460 --> 05:03:40.460
But it's your problem, I'm afraid!

05:03:40.460 --> 05:03:42.460
Not ours!

05:03:42.460 --> 05:03:44.460
What does he mean?

05:03:44.460 --> 05:03:46.460
We don't have a problem, do we?

05:03:46.460 --> 05:03:48.460
Please do come in anyway, everybody!

05:03:48.460 --> 05:03:50.460
Please!

05:03:50.460 --> 05:03:51.460
You too! All of you come in!

05:03:51.460 --> 05:03:53.460
Come in, everybody!

05:03:55.460 --> 05:03:57.460
Move aside! I'm in Georgia!

05:04:07.460 --> 05:04:09.460
Whatever happened was this year!

05:04:09.460 --> 05:04:11.460
Hey, Snorke!

05:04:15.460 --> 05:04:17.460
Alicia!

05:04:21.460 --> 05:04:23.460
Mom!

05:04:23.460 --> 05:04:25.460
We've come to see you, Alicia!

05:04:25.460 --> 05:04:27.460
That was nice of you!

05:04:29.460 --> 05:04:31.460
Your grandmother isn't home, is she?

05:04:31.460 --> 05:04:33.460
No! Then we can play hide and seek!

05:04:33.460 --> 05:04:35.460
I can't!

05:04:35.460 --> 05:04:37.460
I promised Grandma there!

05:04:37.460 --> 05:04:39.460
Yes, I know, Snorke can tell me!

05:04:39.460 --> 05:04:41.460
That was a really great thing to do!

05:04:41.460 --> 05:04:43.460
But you didn't promise not to see us!

05:04:43.460 --> 05:04:45.460
You just promised not to go to Mom and Valley, didn't you?

05:04:45.460 --> 05:04:47.460
Yeah!

05:04:47.460 --> 05:04:49.460
And listen, you never promised not to play with us either, did you?

05:04:49.460 --> 05:04:51.460
No!

05:04:51.460 --> 05:04:53.460
So, if we came here to see you instead of you to us,

05:04:53.460 --> 05:04:55.460
then it's alright!

05:04:55.460 --> 05:04:57.460
And you don't have to break your promise!

05:04:57.460 --> 05:04:59.460
Oh! I suppose so!

05:04:59.460 --> 05:05:01.460
Yes, I suppose you're right!

05:05:01.460 --> 05:05:03.460
Well, let's play!

05:05:03.460 --> 05:05:05.460
Yeah!

05:05:05.460 --> 05:05:11.460
13, 4, 7, 5, 8!

05:05:11.460 --> 05:05:13.460
Oh!

05:05:25.460 --> 05:05:29.460
That afternoon, they all had the most wonderful time playing hide and seek in the woods!

05:05:29.460 --> 05:05:31.460
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

05:05:31.460 --> 05:05:35.460
I'm Jule!

05:05:35.460 --> 05:05:37.460
Three!

05:05:37.460 --> 05:05:39.460
Your titties are!

05:05:39.460 --> 05:05:41.460
Five!

05:05:41.460 --> 05:05:43.460
Six!

05:05:43.460 --> 05:05:45.460
Seven!

05:05:45.460 --> 05:05:47.460
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

05:05:47.460 --> 05:05:49.460
Nine!

05:05:49.460 --> 05:05:51.460
Ten!

05:05:51.460 --> 05:05:53.460
Eleven!

05:05:57.460 --> 05:06:03.460
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements!

05:06:03.460 --> 05:06:11.460
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements!

05:06:11.460 --> 05:06:15.460
They're always happy and goes at play!

05:06:15.460 --> 05:06:19.460
The Moons are having fun day after day!

05:06:19.460 --> 05:06:21.460
The Moons!

05:06:21.460 --> 05:06:25.460
The Moons!

05:06:25.460 --> 05:06:29.460
The Moons!

05:06:29.460 --> 05:06:33.460
The Moons!

05:06:33.460 --> 05:06:35.460
The Moons!

05:06:35.460 --> 05:06:39.460
The Moons!

05:06:39.460 --> 05:06:41.460
The Moons!

05:06:41.460 --> 05:06:45.460
The Moons!

05:06:45.460 --> 05:06:49.460
The Moons!

05:06:49.460 --> 05:06:53.460
The Moons!

05:06:53.460 --> 05:06:57.460
Here they are for one and all!

05:06:57.460 --> 05:07:01.460
The Moons are about to call!

05:07:01.460 --> 05:07:03.460
Come on and sit down here with me!

05:07:03.460 --> 05:07:05.460
They're here for you on your TV!

05:07:05.460 --> 05:07:09.460
They are the movements!

05:07:09.460 --> 05:07:11.460
They are the movements!

05:07:11.460 --> 05:07:13.460
So come with me!

05:07:13.460 --> 05:07:15.460
Give me your hand!

05:07:15.460 --> 05:07:17.460
I'll take you up to a moment land!

05:07:17.460 --> 05:07:21.460
You can fly just like a bird!

05:07:21.460 --> 05:07:23.460
Sing that song ever!

05:07:23.460 --> 05:07:25.460
There were the movements!

05:07:25.460 --> 05:07:31.460
There were the movements!

05:07:31.460 --> 05:07:35.460
There were the movement!

05:07:35.460 --> 05:07:37.460
There were the movements!

05:07:37.460 --> 05:07:41.460
There were the movements!

05:07:55.460 --> 05:08:03.460
Big explosions could be heard in Mumen Valley almost every night and Mumen couldn't sleep a wink.

05:08:03.460 --> 05:08:07.460
Usually there was just one, but sometimes even two.

05:08:11.460 --> 05:08:13.460
You heard it too, Mumen, papa.

05:08:13.460 --> 05:08:16.460
Yes, those loud bangs are keeping me awake.

05:08:16.460 --> 05:08:18.460
I wonder if there'll be another one.

05:08:21.460 --> 05:08:23.460
They seem to be coming from the north.

05:08:23.460 --> 05:08:25.460
Hmm, he's tired, though.

05:08:25.460 --> 05:08:27.460
Or they could be coming from lonely mountains.

05:08:27.460 --> 05:08:31.460
If you ask me, I believe they're the work of the witch.

05:08:31.460 --> 05:08:34.460
The witch? But witches don't make a lot of noise.

05:08:34.460 --> 05:08:37.460
Never know. They're sneaky characters.

05:08:37.460 --> 05:08:40.460
Tomorrow I'll have a few words with the inspector.

05:08:40.460 --> 05:08:42.460
It's up to him to put a stop to it.

05:08:42.460 --> 05:08:45.460
Papa, why would the witch want to make explosions?

05:08:45.460 --> 05:08:46.460
Why not?

05:08:46.460 --> 05:08:50.460
The first bang wakes me up and then I lie awake waiting for the second one,

05:08:50.460 --> 05:08:52.460
which might not come at all.

05:08:52.460 --> 05:08:55.460
The bangs might not come from Mumen Valley at all,

05:08:55.460 --> 05:08:57.460
and they might be just an echo off the mountains.

05:08:57.460 --> 05:08:58.460
You think so?

05:08:58.460 --> 05:08:59.460
Yes, I do.

05:08:59.460 --> 05:09:01.460
Well, at least that's what Snuffkin thinks.

05:09:01.460 --> 05:09:03.460
I mean, the explosions might come from the sea.

05:09:03.460 --> 05:09:05.460
That's what Snuffkin figured.

05:09:05.460 --> 05:09:08.460
He thought it might be pirates or something making the noises.

05:09:08.460 --> 05:09:11.460
He's already had pirates and they went a long time ago.

05:09:11.460 --> 05:09:13.460
I'm plumping for the witch.

05:09:13.460 --> 05:09:14.460
There's no doubt in my mind.

05:09:14.460 --> 05:09:16.460
Goodness, what are you doing out here?

05:09:16.460 --> 05:09:18.460
We're waiting for another explosion, Mama.

05:09:18.460 --> 05:09:20.460
You'll wait in vain, dear.

05:09:20.460 --> 05:09:22.460
Who do you know that moment, Mama?

05:09:22.460 --> 05:09:24.460
Well, we had two explosions last night,

05:09:24.460 --> 05:09:28.460
and we've never had double explosions for two nights in a row.

05:09:29.460 --> 05:09:31.460
Until now, that is.

05:09:31.460 --> 05:09:32.460
You heard that.

05:09:32.460 --> 05:09:34.460
It clearly came from over there.

05:09:34.460 --> 05:09:35.460
Over there?

05:09:35.460 --> 05:09:37.460
Oh, no. It certainly came from over there.

05:09:37.460 --> 05:09:39.460
You couldn't mistake it.

05:09:39.460 --> 05:09:41.460
I'm sure of it.

05:09:51.460 --> 05:09:53.460
Good morning, Moomin, lovely day.

05:09:53.460 --> 05:09:54.460
Morning, Snuffkin.

05:09:54.460 --> 05:09:55.460
You look very sleepy.

05:09:55.460 --> 05:09:57.460
So would you be a close explosion

05:09:57.460 --> 05:09:59.460
that kept you awake for most of the night?

05:09:59.460 --> 05:10:02.460
Those explosions are really very hard, aren't they?

05:10:02.460 --> 05:10:03.460
They certainly are.

05:10:03.460 --> 05:10:06.460
Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?

05:10:06.460 --> 05:10:09.460
Moomin, Puppers, convinced that she's the one

05:10:09.460 --> 05:10:10.460
who's making the bangs.

05:10:10.460 --> 05:10:11.460
I think he's wrong there.

05:10:11.460 --> 05:10:12.460
That's what I thought.

05:10:12.460 --> 05:10:15.460
But there's nothing I could say to convince him.

05:10:15.460 --> 05:10:18.460
So now I'm going to find out what he's doing.

05:10:18.460 --> 05:10:21.460
So now I'm going to find out for myself.

05:10:21.460 --> 05:10:22.460
You can certainly ask her,

05:10:22.460 --> 05:10:25.460
but do you really trust a witch to tell you the truth?

05:10:27.460 --> 05:10:28.460
Do you, Moomin?

05:10:28.460 --> 05:10:31.460
But witches don't have to lie, Shirley.

05:10:39.460 --> 05:10:41.460
Is that you, Little My?

05:10:43.460 --> 05:10:45.460
And where are you two going?

05:10:45.460 --> 05:10:46.460
Little My.

05:10:46.460 --> 05:10:48.460
Are you tailing me full-time or what?

05:10:48.460 --> 05:10:51.460
Yes, whenever you're sneaking off somewhere,

05:10:51.460 --> 05:10:53.460
I'm not sneaking. I'm just walking.

05:10:53.460 --> 05:10:57.460
Well, I've never seen anyone walking in such a sneaky way.

05:11:01.460 --> 05:11:05.460
Last time the witch tried to keep you from waking up, didn't she?

05:11:05.460 --> 05:11:06.460
So...

05:11:06.460 --> 05:11:09.460
So you think now she's trying to keep you from sleeping?

05:11:09.460 --> 05:11:11.460
Well, if she makes the explosions,

05:11:11.460 --> 05:11:14.460
it's always possible that someone else is the target.

05:11:14.460 --> 05:11:16.460
We know very little about witches,

05:11:16.460 --> 05:11:19.460
and those bangs are probably nothing to do with the Moomons.

05:11:20.460 --> 05:11:22.460
I think you guessed right,

05:11:22.460 --> 05:11:24.460
but try telling that to the Moomons.

05:11:24.460 --> 05:11:26.460
We don't think it's like that at all.

05:11:32.460 --> 05:11:34.460
Wonder if she's at home.

05:11:34.460 --> 05:11:36.460
If she isn't, we can visit Alicia instead.

05:11:36.460 --> 05:11:38.460
Better ask Alicia than the witch.

05:11:38.460 --> 05:11:40.460
Anyway, she's more likely to tell us the truth.

05:11:40.460 --> 05:11:42.460
Yes, you're right.

05:11:45.460 --> 05:11:47.460
Oh, oh, oh.

05:11:50.460 --> 05:11:53.460
Look, you don't seem to realize this is a witch's house.

05:11:53.460 --> 05:11:55.460
What do you mean by that?

05:11:55.460 --> 05:11:57.460
I'll tell you what I mean.

05:11:57.460 --> 05:12:01.460
What I mean is I don't want to be seen talking with goody-goodies like the Moomons.

05:12:01.460 --> 05:12:03.460
You think they'll ruin your reputation,

05:12:03.460 --> 05:12:05.460
is that why you're so worried?

05:12:08.460 --> 05:12:11.460
There's just something very important we wanted to ask you.

05:12:12.460 --> 05:12:14.460
And then we'll leave straight away.

05:12:20.460 --> 05:12:23.460
That room upstairs, is that Alicia's?

05:12:23.460 --> 05:12:24.460
It is.

05:12:24.460 --> 05:12:26.460
Is Alicia there now?

05:12:26.460 --> 05:12:27.460
No, she isn't.

05:12:27.460 --> 05:12:28.460
Where did she go?

05:12:28.460 --> 05:12:30.460
She went to get some wolf's vein.

05:12:30.460 --> 05:12:31.460
When will she be coming back?

05:12:31.460 --> 05:12:33.460
You're not going to stop her studying.

05:12:34.460 --> 05:12:35.460
No.

05:12:35.460 --> 05:12:39.460
We wanted to ask her something about that loud noise we hear every night.

05:12:40.460 --> 05:12:41.460
Ah, that one.

05:12:41.460 --> 05:12:44.460
Hey, are you the one making the bangs?

05:12:44.460 --> 05:12:46.460
I don't make explosions.

05:12:46.460 --> 05:12:47.460
Who is it then?

05:12:47.460 --> 05:12:49.460
I really don't know.

05:12:49.460 --> 05:12:51.460
But why did you say that one then?

05:12:51.460 --> 05:12:53.460
Because the explosions bother me, too.

05:12:54.460 --> 05:12:56.460
You think they're coming from near here?

05:12:56.460 --> 05:12:59.460
I think they're coming from far away from the sea, maybe.

05:12:59.460 --> 05:13:01.460
That's what snuffkin' things, too.

05:13:01.460 --> 05:13:04.460
Any sound from the sea echoes off Lonely Mountain,

05:13:04.460 --> 05:13:06.460
so you think that's where it comes from?

05:13:06.460 --> 05:13:08.460
Why is young man a few days ago?

05:13:08.460 --> 05:13:11.460
I went all the way over to the beach to see what was happening.

05:13:11.460 --> 05:13:14.460
After a whole day's witching and casting magic spells,

05:13:14.460 --> 05:13:16.460
one needs one sleep, you know.

05:13:16.460 --> 05:13:18.460
So, what did you find them?

05:13:18.460 --> 05:13:19.460
Nothing at all.

05:13:19.460 --> 05:13:21.460
There was only one explosion that night,

05:13:21.460 --> 05:13:24.460
so when I got there on my brunt, there was nothing more to see.

05:13:24.460 --> 05:13:27.460
Then we still have no idea who makes the bangs.

05:13:27.460 --> 05:13:30.460
No, and I really upset you thought it was me.

05:13:30.460 --> 05:13:32.460
When a witch creates an explosion,

05:13:32.460 --> 05:13:34.460
it doesn't sound anything like a camel cough.

05:13:34.460 --> 05:13:36.460
I can tell you.

05:13:36.460 --> 05:13:38.460
Camel cough, I like that.

05:13:38.460 --> 05:13:40.460
Camel cough, I like that.

05:13:54.460 --> 05:13:56.460
Thank you very much, Snort Maiden.

05:13:58.460 --> 05:14:01.460
This year I want to grow some black tulips.

05:14:01.460 --> 05:14:04.460
Is there really such a thing as a black tulip?

05:14:04.460 --> 05:14:06.460
There's such a dark red, they look black.

05:14:06.460 --> 05:14:07.460
Oh, I see.

05:14:07.460 --> 05:14:10.460
Although it wouldn't really surprise me, Snort Maiden,

05:14:10.460 --> 05:14:12.460
if there really were black ones somewhere.

05:14:12.460 --> 05:14:14.460
We must ask the hamulineal now.

05:14:14.460 --> 05:14:16.460
Oh, yes.

05:14:16.460 --> 05:14:19.460
I know it's embarrassing, but I'm so excited.

05:14:19.460 --> 05:14:21.460
I can't go to sleep at night.

05:14:21.460 --> 05:14:23.460
Oh, I have no problem going to sleep at night,

05:14:23.460 --> 05:14:25.460
but that noise wakes me up, Pamuline.

05:14:25.460 --> 05:14:26.460
What noise is that?

05:14:26.460 --> 05:14:28.460
I told you that noise.

05:14:29.460 --> 05:14:30.460
Oh, I see.

05:14:30.460 --> 05:14:32.460
You're talking about the explosion.

05:14:32.460 --> 05:14:34.460
You know anything about it, Mr. Hamuline?

05:14:34.460 --> 05:14:36.460
No, nothing at all.

05:14:36.460 --> 05:14:39.460
No, those bangs are not what keeps me awake,

05:14:39.460 --> 05:14:41.460
moment papa.

05:14:41.460 --> 05:14:44.460
No, I'm waiting for a pie from the botanist federation.

05:14:44.460 --> 05:14:45.460
Reply?

05:14:45.460 --> 05:14:48.460
Yes, don't you remember a few months ago?

05:14:48.460 --> 05:14:51.460
Pouse range, I thought I told you about it.

05:14:51.460 --> 05:14:53.460
Well, I certainly told everyone else I know.

05:14:53.460 --> 05:14:56.460
I sent them a brand new species.

05:14:57.460 --> 05:14:58.460
New species?

05:14:58.460 --> 05:15:01.460
I'd never seen anything like it in my whole life.

05:15:01.460 --> 05:15:05.460
A new wild orchid, I'm so excited I can hardly speak.

05:15:05.460 --> 05:15:06.460
Really?

05:15:06.460 --> 05:15:09.460
A new wild orchid, how very interesting.

05:15:09.460 --> 05:15:10.460
Yes, isn't it?

05:15:10.460 --> 05:15:13.460
Oh, it would be such a great honor for me and for everyone else

05:15:13.460 --> 05:15:16.460
if they called it Orkydaka-Hemulensis or Himila Formis.

05:15:16.460 --> 05:15:18.460
No, I'm sure they will.

05:15:18.460 --> 05:15:22.460
So now you understand why I've had so many sleepless nights.

05:15:22.460 --> 05:15:24.460
Yes, indeed.

05:15:24.460 --> 05:15:26.460
The trouble is they should have answered by now.

05:15:26.460 --> 05:15:29.460
Maybe they're still trying to decide what to call it.

05:15:29.460 --> 05:15:32.460
Maybe they can't decide between Orkydaka-Hemulensis

05:15:32.460 --> 05:15:35.460
and Orkydaka-Hemila Formis.

05:15:35.460 --> 05:15:36.460
Hmm.

05:15:36.460 --> 05:15:37.460
Oh.

05:15:37.460 --> 05:15:39.460
What is it?

05:15:39.460 --> 05:15:42.460
Now I see, at last I understand.

05:15:42.460 --> 05:15:45.460
I am getting no reply from the botanist federation

05:15:45.460 --> 05:15:48.460
because it is not a new species.

05:15:48.460 --> 05:15:52.460
Of course, somebody's already found it.

05:15:52.460 --> 05:15:53.460
Oh.

05:15:53.460 --> 05:15:55.460
This is really funny.

05:15:55.460 --> 05:15:59.460
I'm stupid of him.

05:15:59.460 --> 05:16:03.460
This is the end of me as a scientist, of course.

05:16:03.460 --> 05:16:06.460
Calm down, don't upset yourself, Mr. Himulens.

05:16:06.460 --> 05:16:10.460
Everybody will laugh at me and call me Mr. Himulensis.

05:16:10.460 --> 05:16:14.460
Now listen, Mr. Himulens, the reply is a long time coming

05:16:14.460 --> 05:16:17.460
because they must examine your plant most carefully

05:16:17.460 --> 05:16:19.460
before making a decision.

05:16:19.460 --> 05:16:23.460
You must read all the books first to be sure.

05:16:23.460 --> 05:16:27.460
You really think so, Mum and Batman?

05:16:27.460 --> 05:16:29.460
Could it really take so long, do you think?

05:16:29.460 --> 05:16:31.460
Of course, these things take time.

05:16:31.460 --> 05:16:33.460
When did you send it off?

05:16:33.460 --> 05:16:34.460
A month ago.

05:16:34.460 --> 05:16:37.460
Oh, there you are, that's no time at all.

05:16:37.460 --> 05:16:39.460
You have to learn to be patient, Emulensis.

05:16:39.460 --> 05:16:40.460
You think so?

05:16:40.460 --> 05:16:42.460
Oh, I feel better already.

05:16:42.460 --> 05:16:44.460
Oh, I'm so glad you feel happier, Mr. Himulens.

05:16:44.460 --> 05:16:46.460
Don't you worry, my friend.

05:16:46.460 --> 05:16:48.460
Mama, great news dear.

05:16:48.460 --> 05:16:51.460
Mr. Himulens discovered a completely new plant

05:16:51.460 --> 05:16:53.460
and is going to be called Himulensis.

05:16:53.460 --> 05:16:56.460
Oh, that's wonderful.

05:16:56.460 --> 05:16:58.460
Congratulations, Mr. Himulens.

05:16:58.460 --> 05:17:00.460
Oh, well, it isn't official yet.

05:17:00.460 --> 05:17:03.460
No, they're just thinking about the name still.

05:17:03.460 --> 05:17:04.460
Give them time.

05:17:04.460 --> 05:17:06.460
We should have a party for Mr. Himulens.

05:17:06.460 --> 05:17:07.460
Shouldn't we, Papa?

05:17:07.460 --> 05:17:08.460
What?

05:17:08.460 --> 05:17:10.460
Oh, yes, indeed.

05:17:10.460 --> 05:17:12.460
When, Papa, tonight?

05:17:13.460 --> 05:17:15.460
Hmm, let me think.

05:17:15.460 --> 05:17:18.460
We should wait just a little bit longer perhaps.

05:17:18.460 --> 05:17:20.460
Oh, why do you say that?

05:17:20.460 --> 05:17:21.460
Mr. Himulens.

05:17:21.460 --> 05:17:23.460
You know that rare plant you found?

05:17:23.460 --> 05:17:25.460
Does it have any flowers?

05:17:25.460 --> 05:17:26.460
But, of course.

05:17:26.460 --> 05:17:27.460
Are they pretty?

05:17:27.460 --> 05:17:29.460
Very pretty.

05:17:29.460 --> 05:17:32.460
Yes, just like you, Snork Maiden.

05:17:32.460 --> 05:17:34.460
Oh, Mr. Himulens.

05:17:34.460 --> 05:17:39.460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

05:17:40.460 --> 05:17:42.460
Hey, look, Snork Maiden.

05:17:42.460 --> 05:17:45.460
Why don't we go and find out about those explosions tonight, huh?

05:17:45.460 --> 05:17:46.460
All right.

05:17:46.460 --> 05:17:48.460
You'll need me to find the way.

05:17:48.460 --> 05:17:50.460
You want to come along?

05:17:50.460 --> 05:17:51.460
You bet.

05:17:51.460 --> 05:17:52.460
They come late at night.

05:17:52.460 --> 05:17:54.460
I won't go to sleep, Ben.

05:17:54.460 --> 05:17:56.460
What do you think, Snork Maiden?

05:17:56.460 --> 05:17:57.460
I'm not sure.

05:17:57.460 --> 05:18:00.460
Isn't there anything you can do to change your mind, movement?

05:18:00.460 --> 05:18:01.460
I don't know.

05:18:01.460 --> 05:18:02.460
Listen, little Maiden.

05:18:02.460 --> 05:18:03.460
You have to be careful.

05:18:03.460 --> 05:18:04.460
This could be dangerous.

05:18:04.460 --> 05:18:06.460
Obviously, or I wouldn't come.

05:18:06.460 --> 05:18:08.460
Would I spoil my sleep?

05:18:08.460 --> 05:18:10.460
Well, stick close to us, then.

05:18:10.460 --> 05:18:11.460
Yes, do that.

05:18:11.460 --> 05:18:13.460
I also went down to the beach late last night

05:18:13.460 --> 05:18:15.460
to try and find out what was happening.

05:18:15.460 --> 05:18:17.460
And while I was there, I saw the witch flying around

05:18:17.460 --> 05:18:19.460
on her broomstick.

05:18:19.460 --> 05:18:20.460
Oh, really?

05:18:20.460 --> 05:18:22.460
Why didn't you tell me so I could have come along?

05:18:22.460 --> 05:18:23.460
I could hide better than you.

05:18:23.460 --> 05:18:25.460
You're so white.

05:18:25.460 --> 05:18:26.460
See, movement?

05:18:26.460 --> 05:18:29.460
I'm not big in white like you.

05:18:29.460 --> 05:18:31.460
Oh, there's someone coming.

05:18:31.460 --> 05:18:33.460
Who?

05:18:35.460 --> 05:18:37.460
It's Alicia.

05:18:37.460 --> 05:18:39.460
Hey, Alicia.

05:18:39.460 --> 05:18:41.460
Hi, Alicia.

05:18:41.460 --> 05:18:43.460
Oh, my man.

05:18:43.460 --> 05:18:44.460
Hello, Alicia.

05:18:44.460 --> 05:18:45.460
How are you?

05:18:45.460 --> 05:18:47.460
Have you three come here to play with me?

05:18:47.460 --> 05:18:50.460
No, I'm afraid we have, but it's good to see you.

05:18:50.460 --> 05:18:51.460
Yes, Alicia.

05:18:51.460 --> 05:18:52.460
Yes?

05:18:52.460 --> 05:18:55.460
Has your grandmother been kind to you since your last visit to us?

05:18:55.460 --> 05:18:56.460
Very kind.

05:18:56.460 --> 05:18:58.460
She's been treating me very well.

05:18:58.460 --> 05:19:00.460
Ever since I stopped coming to see you.

05:19:00.460 --> 05:19:01.460
Oh, good.

05:19:01.460 --> 05:19:03.460
But we do miss you, Alicia.

05:19:03.460 --> 05:19:04.460
Oh, I miss you, too.

05:19:04.460 --> 05:19:06.460
But I must keep my promise to her.

05:19:06.460 --> 05:19:08.460
She'd be upset if I broke it.

05:19:08.460 --> 05:19:09.460
What are these weeds?

05:19:09.460 --> 05:19:10.460
They're herbs.

05:19:10.460 --> 05:19:12.460
Herbs are very important for a witch.

05:19:12.460 --> 05:19:14.460
And frogs, bellies, and lizard's tails.

05:19:14.460 --> 05:19:16.460
They're important, too, of course.

05:19:16.460 --> 05:19:18.460
I think that's licorice.

05:19:18.460 --> 05:19:19.460
That's right.

05:19:19.460 --> 05:19:20.460
Very clever, Snuffkin.

05:19:20.460 --> 05:19:22.460
We use that for heartburn and coughs.

05:19:22.460 --> 05:19:24.460
The taste smells quite nice.

05:19:24.460 --> 05:19:27.460
And it also stops cows from giving their milk.

05:19:27.460 --> 05:19:28.460
I see.

05:19:28.460 --> 05:19:29.460
That's interesting.

05:19:37.460 --> 05:19:38.460
Oh, it's right.

05:19:51.460 --> 05:19:53.460
Hello, Mr. Hillman.

05:19:53.460 --> 05:19:55.460
Splendid days.

05:19:55.460 --> 05:19:57.460
Hello, Mr. Hillman.

05:19:57.460 --> 05:19:59.460
Don't you work so hard.

05:19:59.460 --> 05:20:02.460
Yeah, I guess I do with that.

05:20:03.460 --> 05:20:05.460
Wait.

05:20:05.460 --> 05:20:06.460
Stop.

05:20:06.460 --> 05:20:08.460
What is it, Mr. Hillman?

05:20:08.460 --> 05:20:09.460
My letter.

05:20:09.460 --> 05:20:11.460
I just want my letter.

05:20:11.460 --> 05:20:12.460
There isn't one.

05:20:12.460 --> 05:20:13.460
But why not?

05:20:13.460 --> 05:20:16.460
You didn't have any yesterday or the day before.

05:20:16.460 --> 05:20:18.460
Yeah, I know that.

05:20:18.460 --> 05:20:19.460
Nobody's written to you.

05:20:19.460 --> 05:20:20.460
That's why.

05:20:20.460 --> 05:20:22.460
Well, somebody should have written.

05:20:22.460 --> 05:20:25.460
Are you quite, quite sure that you've gone through your bag properly?

05:20:25.460 --> 05:20:29.460
Don't you know I'm expecting an important letter from an important scientist?

05:20:29.460 --> 05:20:31.460
It must be in your bag.

05:20:31.460 --> 05:20:33.460
Ah, all right, then.

05:20:33.460 --> 05:20:34.460
Go ahead.

05:20:34.460 --> 05:20:35.460
What?

05:20:35.460 --> 05:20:38.460
Well, you don't seem to trust me to do my job properly, Mr. Hemulin.

05:20:38.460 --> 05:20:39.460
Go ahead.

05:20:39.460 --> 05:20:41.460
Have a look for yourself, then.

05:20:41.460 --> 05:20:43.460
Oh, but of course I trust you.

05:20:43.460 --> 05:20:44.460
Sorry.

05:20:44.460 --> 05:20:45.460
No, no.

05:20:45.460 --> 05:20:46.460
You better have a look.

05:20:46.460 --> 05:20:47.460
What do you think I do?

05:20:47.460 --> 05:20:49.460
Steam them open and read them at night?

05:20:49.460 --> 05:20:50.460
No.

05:20:50.460 --> 05:20:54.460
Oh, you seem to have a lot of letters today.

05:20:54.460 --> 05:20:58.460
Oh, I really think I should ask for a higher salary.

05:20:58.460 --> 05:21:00.460
I deserve it.

05:21:01.460 --> 05:21:02.460
Ah!

05:21:02.460 --> 05:21:04.460
I'm just starving.

05:21:04.460 --> 05:21:07.460
I might have to go over and visit the moments in a minute.

05:21:13.460 --> 05:21:15.460
Oh.

05:21:15.460 --> 05:21:17.460
I'm sleepy, too.

05:21:17.460 --> 05:21:19.460
I could go on sleeping.

05:21:19.460 --> 05:21:20.460
Oh!

05:21:20.460 --> 05:21:21.460
Oh!

05:21:21.460 --> 05:21:23.460
What do you think you're doing?

05:21:23.460 --> 05:21:25.460
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:21:25.460 --> 05:21:27.460
I didn't see you there.

05:21:27.460 --> 05:21:28.460
Hmm?

05:21:28.460 --> 05:21:30.460
There's nothing else out here and you didn't see me?

05:21:30.460 --> 05:21:31.460
I'm sorry.

05:21:31.460 --> 05:21:32.460
Oh, dear.

05:21:32.460 --> 05:21:34.460
What does this matter with you?

05:21:34.460 --> 05:21:37.460
Is this place called Moomin Valley?

05:21:37.460 --> 05:21:38.460
Yes.

05:21:38.460 --> 05:21:39.460
That's right.

05:21:39.460 --> 05:21:41.460
At last, I found it.

05:21:41.460 --> 05:21:43.460
I never thought I'd really make it.

05:21:43.460 --> 05:21:44.460
Excuse me.

05:21:44.460 --> 05:21:46.460
Are you all right?

05:21:46.460 --> 05:21:48.460
Doctor me, miss.

05:21:48.460 --> 05:21:50.460
Oh, tell me what's bothering you.

05:21:50.460 --> 05:21:51.460
Huh?

05:21:51.460 --> 05:21:52.460
Oh, she's ill.

05:21:52.460 --> 05:21:54.460
She's got a fever.

05:21:54.460 --> 05:21:56.460
Please leave me alone.

05:21:56.460 --> 05:21:58.460
But you can lie here.

05:21:58.460 --> 05:22:00.460
You should be in bed, young lady.

05:22:00.460 --> 05:22:02.460
Do you know a man called Hamilton?

05:22:02.460 --> 05:22:03.460
Yes.

05:22:03.460 --> 05:22:06.460
Have you walked all the way to Moomin Valley to visit him?

05:22:06.460 --> 05:22:08.460
So I have come to the right place.

05:22:08.460 --> 05:22:10.460
He does live here.

05:22:10.460 --> 05:22:11.460
Oh, yes.

05:22:11.460 --> 05:22:12.460
He lives very close to here.

05:22:12.460 --> 05:22:16.460
I'm so glad I must see him immediately here.

05:22:16.460 --> 05:22:18.460
Oh, what shall I do?

05:22:18.460 --> 05:22:19.460
I must do something.

05:22:19.460 --> 05:22:20.460
Come here, someone.

05:22:20.460 --> 05:22:22.460
Someone help me.

05:22:22.460 --> 05:22:24.460
Oh, my goodness.

05:22:24.460 --> 05:22:27.460
Help!

05:22:27.460 --> 05:22:30.460
Anyone help!

05:22:30.460 --> 05:22:33.460
Help me somebody!

05:22:43.460 --> 05:22:44.460
Papa!

05:22:44.460 --> 05:22:45.460
Papa!

05:22:45.460 --> 05:22:47.460
He's up in the guest room if you want him.

05:22:47.460 --> 05:22:49.460
Mama's there as well.

05:22:49.460 --> 05:22:50.460
What for?

05:22:50.460 --> 05:22:52.460
I just rescued a girl, you know.

05:22:52.460 --> 05:22:53.460
A girl?

05:22:53.460 --> 05:22:54.460
Did you, Sniff?

05:22:54.460 --> 05:22:55.460
That's right.

05:22:55.460 --> 05:22:56.460
Very pretty, too.

05:22:56.460 --> 05:22:59.460
She's ill and I put her to bed myself.

05:22:59.460 --> 05:23:00.460
I'm going to see her.

05:23:00.460 --> 05:23:01.460
Me, too.

05:23:03.460 --> 05:23:05.460
I want another look as well.

05:23:07.460 --> 05:23:09.460
First, we must bring her fever down.

05:23:09.460 --> 05:23:11.460
I think you're right.

05:23:11.460 --> 05:23:13.460
Yes?

05:23:16.460 --> 05:23:18.460
Sniff just told us about her.

05:23:18.460 --> 05:23:19.460
Oh, dear.

05:23:19.460 --> 05:23:20.460
Is she unconscious?

05:23:20.460 --> 05:23:21.460
Yes.

05:23:21.460 --> 05:23:22.460
Where'd she come from?

05:23:22.460 --> 05:23:24.460
We don't know, little Maya.

05:23:24.460 --> 05:23:26.460
But Sniff said she'd come here to visit the hemeland.

05:23:26.460 --> 05:23:27.460
That's right.

05:23:27.460 --> 05:23:29.460
And Snort Maiden's gone to get him.

05:23:29.460 --> 05:23:31.460
She's pretty, isn't she?

05:23:31.460 --> 05:23:32.460
You're right.

05:23:32.460 --> 05:23:33.460
Very.

05:23:33.460 --> 05:23:36.460
By the way, Moomin, what did the witch say?

05:23:36.460 --> 05:23:37.460
Oh, dear.

05:23:37.460 --> 05:23:39.460
Must I really run like this?

05:23:39.460 --> 05:23:40.460
Oh!

05:23:40.460 --> 05:23:42.460
Where is the visitor, young girl?

05:23:42.460 --> 05:23:45.460
Well, if she's sick, why don't you give her some medicine?

05:23:45.460 --> 05:23:47.460
I don't know any young girls apart from her.

05:23:47.460 --> 05:23:48.460
Don't!

05:23:48.460 --> 05:23:49.460
Just keep running!

05:23:53.460 --> 05:23:56.460
I told you, I do not know this person.

05:23:56.460 --> 05:23:57.460
Maybe she's changed.

05:23:57.460 --> 05:23:59.460
I've already told you.

05:23:59.460 --> 05:24:01.460
I have never known any young girls.

05:24:01.460 --> 05:24:04.460
Then why do you think she'd want to come to visit you, hemeland?

05:24:04.460 --> 05:24:06.460
She's a botanist.

05:24:06.460 --> 05:24:09.460
And obviously, she's heard of me and wants to come and see

05:24:09.460 --> 05:24:11.460
the famous hemeland for herself.

05:24:11.460 --> 05:24:12.460
Oh, dear.

05:24:12.460 --> 05:24:14.460
She can tell us when she wakes up.

05:24:14.460 --> 05:24:17.460
We must leave her now so that grandma's medicine can work.

05:24:18.460 --> 05:24:20.460
I think I'll be getting home.

05:24:20.460 --> 05:24:22.460
Oh, we couldn't let you go just like that.

05:24:22.460 --> 05:24:24.460
Please, stay and have some tea with us.

05:24:24.460 --> 05:24:26.460
Thank you, but no, I have some plans to press.

05:24:26.460 --> 05:24:29.460
And you're sure you're quite sure you don't know this girl?

05:24:29.460 --> 05:24:31.460
Absolutely certain.

05:24:31.460 --> 05:24:33.460
I really must go.

05:24:36.460 --> 05:24:38.460
I'd forgotten all about you.

05:24:38.460 --> 05:24:41.460
I'm sure you're sure you're sure you don't know this girl.

05:24:41.460 --> 05:24:42.460
Absolutely certain.

05:24:42.460 --> 05:24:44.460
I really must go.

05:24:45.460 --> 05:24:47.460
I'd forgotten all about the bangs.

05:24:47.460 --> 05:24:49.460
Well, we haven't snuffed Ken and I.

05:24:49.460 --> 05:24:51.460
I'm going to look for them tonight.

05:24:51.460 --> 05:24:53.460
I'd like to come too, but I can't.

05:24:53.460 --> 05:24:55.460
I'm going with them.

05:24:55.460 --> 05:24:57.460
Are you snort maiden?

05:24:57.460 --> 05:24:59.460
You'll be hiding on the beach in the middle of the night?

05:24:59.460 --> 05:25:00.460
Yes.

05:25:00.460 --> 05:25:03.460
And then we'll rush off to where the bangs are coming from as soon as we hear them.

05:25:03.460 --> 05:25:05.460
That's the plan.

05:25:05.460 --> 05:25:07.460
Oh, I'd really love to come.

05:25:07.460 --> 05:25:08.460
I'd rather go to bed.

05:25:08.460 --> 05:25:11.460
I'd be a bit scared of the beach in the middle of the night.

05:25:11.460 --> 05:25:14.460
After all, it's my duty to stay here with Movement Mama.

05:25:14.460 --> 05:25:16.460
Are you coming, Sniff?

05:25:16.460 --> 05:25:18.460
Certainly not.

05:25:18.460 --> 05:25:20.460
Not me.

05:25:22.460 --> 05:25:25.460
It just occurred to me that's why she's here.

05:25:25.460 --> 05:25:27.460
Ah.

05:25:37.460 --> 05:25:39.460
Here, you better take this movement.

05:25:39.460 --> 05:25:41.460
You might get very hungry.

05:25:41.460 --> 05:25:43.460
Oh, thank you, Mama.

05:25:43.460 --> 05:25:45.460
A midnight snack. I really envy you.

05:25:45.460 --> 05:25:48.460
Well, Grandpa, why don't you come with us?

05:25:48.460 --> 05:25:50.460
Oh, there's nothing I'd love more.

05:25:50.460 --> 05:25:53.460
But I'd better not tonight. Right, Mama?

05:25:53.460 --> 05:25:55.460
Oh, definitely not.

05:25:55.460 --> 05:25:59.460
What would I do if something happened to the girl while you were away?

05:25:59.460 --> 05:26:00.460
Exactly.

05:26:00.460 --> 05:26:03.460
All right, Papa. We'll find out about the bangs for you.

05:26:03.460 --> 05:26:05.460
Thank you, Momenta.

05:26:12.460 --> 05:26:15.460
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Good.

05:26:15.460 --> 05:26:17.460
I think we should save this food for a while.

05:26:17.460 --> 05:26:20.460
We might have to wait a long time for the explosions.

05:26:20.460 --> 05:26:22.460
And they might not come tonight.

05:26:22.460 --> 05:26:24.460
Stop stuffing yourself, Movement.

05:26:24.460 --> 05:26:26.460
The rest is for a snuffkin and me.

05:26:26.460 --> 05:26:28.460
But you can't eat anymore?

05:26:28.460 --> 05:26:30.460
Yes, I can. We must share it in equal parts.

05:26:30.460 --> 05:26:32.460
Otherwise, it's not fair.

05:26:32.460 --> 05:26:35.460
I think it should be shared in proportion to how big one is.

05:26:53.460 --> 05:26:55.460
Oh.

05:27:01.460 --> 05:27:03.460
Hmm?

05:27:03.460 --> 05:27:05.460
Ah, what are you back, John Brown?

05:27:05.460 --> 05:27:06.460
From the sea.

05:27:06.460 --> 05:27:07.460
Keep a sharp look down.

05:27:07.460 --> 05:27:09.460
Look over there.

05:27:11.460 --> 05:27:13.460
What is it?

05:27:13.460 --> 05:27:16.460
Ah, ah. Wow.

05:27:16.460 --> 05:27:18.460
Ah.

05:27:19.460 --> 05:27:23.460
That's what I call fireworks.

05:27:26.460 --> 05:27:27.460
Come on.

05:27:27.460 --> 05:27:29.460
Somebody must be out there in a boat.

05:27:39.460 --> 05:27:41.460
There's a boat.

05:27:41.460 --> 05:27:43.460
The fireworks must have come from there.

05:27:43.460 --> 05:27:46.460
Hey, come ashore.

05:27:48.460 --> 05:27:50.460
Is that the hand you like?

05:27:50.460 --> 05:27:51.460
No, I don't think so.

05:27:51.460 --> 05:27:54.460
It looks like him, but he was much younger.

05:27:54.460 --> 05:27:57.460
And so as a result of their excursion to the beach,

05:27:57.460 --> 05:27:59.460
they finally learned that the big bangs

05:27:59.460 --> 05:28:03.460
that had been waking everyone up were fireworks.

05:28:03.460 --> 05:28:05.460
They also learned that the fireworks were coming

05:28:05.460 --> 05:28:08.460
from a boat far out to sea.

05:28:08.460 --> 05:28:14.460
But the man who had sent them up disappeared into the night.

05:28:14.460 --> 05:28:21.460
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

05:28:21.460 --> 05:28:28.460
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

05:28:28.460 --> 05:28:32.460
They're always happy and goes at play.

05:28:32.460 --> 05:28:36.460
The movements are having fun day after day.

05:28:36.460 --> 05:28:39.460
The movements.

05:28:39.460 --> 05:28:43.460
The movements.

05:28:43.460 --> 05:28:49.460
The movements.
