1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're here for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
They are the movements. You can fly just like a bird, sing the best song ever.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There were the moments, there were the moments, there were the moments.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
There were the moments, there were the moments.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:01:49,799

10
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,560
boat they'd found washed up on the beach.

11
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,400
They didn't know where they were going, and thought it would be much more fun that way.

12
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,040
Mama, we're not going away forever, you know.

13
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
I hope not.

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,599
I don't think we'll need all these pots and pans.

15
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,659
It's best to be prepared at sea.

16
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,259
What do you mean?

17
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,060
Well, you're only complaining if you don't get a hot meal.

18
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,219
I never complain.

19
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:16,340
And you know how hungry the sea air made you all last time we went out on a boat.

20
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,340
You'd have been glad of food then.

21
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,139
Hmm, you got to rough it a bit if you want an adventure.

22
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:24,819
Yes, but it will be more fun with coffee and pancakes.

23
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:28,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, pancakes. Aren't you too ready yet?

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hello, Mummian! Hi, Snorkvagan!

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Whoa!

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oh!

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh!

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh!

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh!

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh! Whoa!

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Ugh! Ugh!

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Ugh!

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Must you use that ladder?

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm all right!

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Mom, and you're gonna hurt yourself one of these days!

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's good practice!

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Is Snork coming with us?

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,199
He says he hasn't got time for sailing boats at the moment.

39
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,919
I'd much rather a real sailing boat than a paper flying ship any day.

40
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:17,759
Are mom aren't Papa ready yet?

41
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,240
They're packing a path the kitchen.

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,360
Oh, it's too full.

43
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,000
Have we got to take all that with us?

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Mama thinks it's better to be safe than sorry, and she's usually right.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Tell me, Moomin, where exactly are we going?

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We haven't decided yet.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's right. Wait and see. Oh, Mr. Hamillin! Oh! Have you found a rare plan for your collection yet?

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Unfortunately not.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There are lots of things to do.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm not sure if I can find it.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sure I can find it.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sure I can find it.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Mr. Hamillin!

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh! Have you found a rare plan for your collection yet?

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Unfortunately not.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
There are lots of these in Mumen Valley already.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Goodness, where are you taking all that?

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We're going sailing.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
How exciting, charting new seas and exploring desert islands.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I have an owl.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If I help you load up the boat can I please come with you?

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Captain the bridge! Man the yard arm!

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hankers away! Sailors beware! Spice the manbrace! All hands on deck! Full speed ahead!

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hey Sniff, any son of the mule? Not yet. It's a great day to go sailing. I wonder where we're going.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't have any idea. I don't actually like sailing much.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Do you get sick?

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, not really sick. It's just that I can't swim.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And if it's rough, it frightens me and I panic a bit.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It looks like it's going to stay calm.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So don't worry.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Right, that's the lot.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Now, all aboard.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Mama, little Mai,

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Stafkin,

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Mumin,

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Snork Maiden,

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and Mr. Hambylin' of course.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Isn't he a bit old for adventures?

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Not at all.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No, Mumin Papa has promised to find a deserted island

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:47,000
where I shall search for rare plants. Oh, there's no room. Don't be silly, sniff, of course there is.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It looks very full, almost thinking.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There's no way this boat could sink.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Now come on, get in.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh. It looks very full, almost thinking. There's no way this boat could sink.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Now come on, get him.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Really?

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I promise it'll be all right.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Won't it, Papa?

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, if it stays like this, it will, moment.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll come next time.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's go, moment, Papa. He's just a scary cat.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,240
Hmm. We'll go without woman, Papa. He's just a scary cat.

95
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Mm.

96
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,279
We'll go without you then, Sniff.

97
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,160
I think that will be best.

98
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,639
Anyway, someone did better stay and look after Mom and House,

99
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:36,199
and it might just as well be me.

100
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,040
That's very thoughtful of you.

101
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,600
There's a pancake on the kitchen table

102
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,560
that you can have for lunch.

103
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,160
Thank you, Mom and Mama.

104
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,000
Have a nice trip.

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I wish Nuford come. He's a big softy.

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Well, he's not very good at swimming,

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:36,079
and he doesn't eat rather a lot. This is the life, isn't it, Mama? It certainly is, dear.

108
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,079
Oh, look, not a breath of wind. Shall I start rowing, Papa?

109
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,519
Yes, you'd better get snuffkin' to help you.

110
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,800
Aye-aye, Captain.

111
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,319
Tardly moving! You'll have to do better than that.

112
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,720
We're doing our best.

113
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,319
You two would be useless as galley slaves. It's good that we're not then, isn't it?

114
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,480
So then, what's your excuse?

115
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,000
It's not easy rowing against the tide. You try it.

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No, dear, at this rate, I should be lucky to find one rare plant.

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, Mr. Hamlin, you could always try collecting some seaweed instead. There's plenty of that.

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I have heard tales that if you whistle, those who perished at sea will send you a wind.

119
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,360
Land! A Hoi! Look, Moomin, Papa!

120
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,360
That's too small to be any good.

121
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:52,000
You're right. Hey, look, Papa! We're moving again!

122
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The tides turned and the winds up.

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,799
What a beautiful island!

124
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,000
And a perfect place to land, too.

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh, I bet this place has got some rare plants.

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Be careful when you explore. There could be wild animals there.

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Now if someone will go and collect some wood, I'll get a fire started.

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I've had none of you will say no to coffee and pancakes.

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Watch me, you land lovers. I'll go and pull the boat ashore.

130
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hmm, I suppose you will ride. This will come in handy. As I said, Papa, it's always better to ruff it with a little bit of luxury.

131
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I wonder if we're the first to set foot on the island.

132
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Thank you, children.

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Is there anything else you want us to do?

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No, I don't think so.

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Is it okay if I go explore the island?

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Of course, off you go.

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Coming, Snort made up.

138
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll stay and help Mum and Mama with the cooking.

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,559
Mama, you said we needed firewood, is this enough?

140
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,559
My goodness for a lot.

141
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,039
You know, I don't think anyone lives on this island.

142
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,039
I haven't seen anyone unless they're hiding in the bushes.

143
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,840
I've seen someone.

144
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,240
Oh yeah? Who?

145
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,840
Well, they weren't very big.

146
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,500
What do you mean? This big? Well, they weren't very big. What do you mean?

147
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
This big?

148
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Well, same as me.

149
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
What did they look like?

150
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Sort of white and ghostly and not very friendly looking either, Moomin.

151
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, you probably just thought you saw something a little mic.

152
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,500
I did see them. I did too!

153
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Keep your hair on.

154
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm not saying you didn't see anything.

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Goodness, this is magnificent. Oh, what a find!

156
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And what's this? Yes. Oh, well, well, well, well.

157
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,840
I've never seen such rare and beautiful plants.

158
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Huh?

159
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Whoa.

160
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Whoa.

161
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,799
Whoa.

162
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,799
Whoa.

163
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,799
Whoa.

164
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,799
Whoa.

165
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,799
Whoa.

166
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,799
Whoa.

167
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,799
Whoa.

168
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,799
Whoa.

169
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:42,799
Whoa.

170
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,799
Whoa.

171
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,799
Whoa.

172
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,919
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Well, what's this? Goodness, it's a barometer. Now let's see.

173
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,919
Rain and storm. Probably broken.

174
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,559
Oh, hello. Who are you?

175
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,559
Oh, I see. This is your barometer, isn't it? Now watch it.

176
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,000
Mind you don't travel on those flowers, will you?

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh, no, no, no, no. They're coming to get me. Don't go away. Don't go away.

178
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I think what little my saw was a haddy fatner.

179
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
They're not ghosts. Are they? Snuff can?

180
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
No, they look kind of like it, but they're really harmless enough movement.

181
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, leave me alone!

182
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Oh, dear, what on earth was that?

183
00:12:34,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It sounded like Mr. Hamulin! Don't get away, oh, oh, oh, baby, please. That's it! That's what I saw! It's Mr. Hamulin.

184
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Help! Get me down!

185
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Why are they after you, Mr. Hamulin?

186
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What'd you do to them?

187
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I don't know! I just tapped on this post and asked them to be careful with the flowers.

188
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
They seem a bit angry to me.

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, then I tapped the marombin in the tent.

190
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,799
I'm going to get you a little bit more. I don't know. I just tapped on this post and asked them to be careful with the flowers.

191
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:28,200
They seem a bit angry to me.

192
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,600
Well, then I tapped the marrometer to check the weather and they came at me.

193
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,899
Well, I don't think it's a flower's a mad about.

194
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,500
Maybe they thought you were trying to steal the marrometer.

195
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,600
I don't want it to keep it.

196
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,399
My goodness, I'm collecting flowers, not marrometers.

197
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,399
Well, hang on.

198
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't hang on much longer, hurry, please.

199
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
They don't look so easily frightened.

200
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No, now let me think.

201
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Hurry, I'm slipping.

202
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I've got it, Mr. Hemmulin.

203
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The hadifattoners can't see or hear very well,

204
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
but they are very sensitive.

205
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We'll have to try and frighten them.

206
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,519
I suggest you shake the post as hard as you can

207
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,000
Harder harder mr.

208
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,539
Look they can feel the ground moving keep going mr. Hemmielin

209
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Are you sure this will work Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm getting really tired. Her big sausage, if I can't. They're not going, self-kin.

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Are you sure this will work?

211
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah.

212
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh!

213
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh! Oh! Oh!

214
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You can stop now, Mr. Hemmilen.

215
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Mr. Hemmilen!

216
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh, dear!

217
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Hey, are you all right, Mr. Hemmilen?

218
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What disgusting creatures!

219
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I have a good mind to take their precious barometer.

220
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't think that's such a good idea.

221
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's no good anyway. It's not working.

222
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
How do you know that, Mr. Hemmulin?

223
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Look, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?

224
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But according to this barometer, it should be pouring down with rain.

225
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This is the way to explore real home cooking.

226
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It just takes a little thought.

227
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And woman papa is always prepared, aren't you dear?

228
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Double zero. It can't get any lower than that.

229
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What does that mean?

230
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
If it was working, it would mean we'd be in for a terrible storm.

231
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,299
Hmm. I think the reading might be right after all, Mr. Hemmulun.

232
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,799
See the way the sky is darkening.

233
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Look at those storm clouds. We better go before it's too late.

234
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,000
But there won't be time to get home. We'll be shipwreck moving, Papa.

235
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Surely there's still time.

236
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We don't want to go back to Moomin Valley yet. We've only explored half the island.

237
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Besides, you never know what we might find, Snort Maiden.

238
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I wanted to get my hands on those haddy fat nurse!

239
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's the last thing I wanted to do little mind, the very last!

240
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I think we ought to leave now.

241
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What do you think, Mama?

242
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Well, you're the captain, dear. It's up to you. So I am. Now, let you think mama well you're the captain dear it's up to you so I am now let me think Oh, can we? Yes, but we must put the tent up before it starts raining. What tent?

243
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Always be prepared.

244
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's my motto.

245
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You're very clever to think of everything.

246
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
First, we must lower the sails and pull them up.

247
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh, can we?

248
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes, but we must put the tent up before it starts raining.

249
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What tent?

250
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Always be prepared.

251
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's my motto.

252
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You're very clever to think of everything.

253
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:28,000
First, we must lower the sails and pull the boat up so that she's out of harm's way. Oh!

254
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That should do it! Oh!

255
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Well done, everybody.

256
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It should be safe here.

257
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Now hurry with the tent, the storm's nearly here.

258
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Are you all right, Mr. Hemmulan?

259
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You stay here and rest, eh?

260
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
We'll manage without you.

261
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I am a bit tired.

262
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You get your breath back first, but don't forget to tie the boat to that tree before you come up.

263
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It looks bad. A real humdinger.

264
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You can trust me.

265
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Right, let's get that tent up.

266
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh, dear, what a day! Oh dear, what a day! Oh dear, what a day! Oh dear, what a day!

267
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh dear, what a day!

268
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh dear, what a day!

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh dear, what a day!

270
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh dear, what a day!

271
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh dear, what a day!

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh dear, what a day! Oh dear, what's this here?

273
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Oh, yes! Well, fans, see that I've never seen one of these before.

274
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Snuffkin?

275
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What's happening? It's coming good. What's happening?

276
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's coming really fast.

277
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Look at the rain over the sea.

278
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
We're gonna get soaked if we stay here.

279
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Just a minute.

280
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But we'll get wet.

281
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I know, but it's so exciting.

282
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Things which you have no control over.

283
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You can see this great big storm coming towards you,

284
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and you can't do anything about it.

285
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
No.

286
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You have to time it just right.

287
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
When to make a run for shelter, you mean?

288
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I knew you'd understand.

289
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,480
I wonder what the haddy Fatterners are doing.

290
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,880
Waiting for the thunderstorm.

291
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Why?

292
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,119
Because they get energy from the electricity and the lightning.

293
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,119
Really?

294
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,119
That's it!

295
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:46,000
Come on! I've never seen rain like this. It'll be over soon enough, Momen. You're dressed, Mom.

296
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I know.

297
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's all right.

298
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll look after you.

299
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I know.

300
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I know.

301
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I know.

302
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I know.

303
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I know.

304
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I know.

305
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I know. I know. Oh!

306
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's all right.

307
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'll look after you. The That was a close one. Too close. I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

308
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

309
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

310
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

311
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

312
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

313
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

314
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

315
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

316
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

317
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That was a close one. Too close. I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

318
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What a find I made today!

319
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What a find I made today! If, like the movements and their friends, you're stranded on the desert island in a huge storm.

320
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,720
All you can do is wait until it's blown itself out.

321
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,000
But what if the waves are so high that your boat has caught up and washed out to sea?

322
00:21:49,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That is a different story altogether. They love the laughter and they love the living the moments

323
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the moments The movements. They're always happy and always at play.

324
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

325
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The movements.

326
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The movements.

327
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
They love the laughter and they love the living.

328
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The movements. They love the living, the movements

329
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

330
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
They're always happy and goes at play

331
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements The Move is...

332
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The Move is...
