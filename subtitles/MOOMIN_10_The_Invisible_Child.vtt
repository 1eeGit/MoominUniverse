00:00.000 --> 00:18.320
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come.

00:18.320 --> 00:26.560
Come on and sit down here with me, they're here for you on your TV, they are the movements,

00:26.560 --> 00:34.880

00:44.000 --> 00:55.520
were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:55.520 --> 01:20.240
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

01:25.520 --> 01:50.240
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

01:50.240 --> 02:14.960
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

02:14.960 --> 02:41.680
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

02:41.840 --> 02:57.120
that's the invisible child, I wonder what she really looks like,

02:58.560 --> 03:04.640
oh well good morning everybody, morning lazy bones, we've been up for hours and hours,

03:05.200 --> 03:11.360
we're going to play hide and seek in the woods, great, nanny are you all right, yes thanks,

03:13.280 --> 03:18.320
this is dumb if I could see your face I wouldn't have to ask, doesn't help with you sniff you

03:18.320 --> 03:43.280
all with ask silly questions it's a bit big for hide and seek isn't it but that's

03:43.520 --> 03:53.840
so good about it okay this is a good place to start but we've got a new rule for the game once

03:53.840 --> 03:58.880
you found somewhere to hide you've got to stay in the same place no moving about anyone do you

03:58.880 --> 04:07.360
understand nanny right you're to go first sniff why isn't always me first we'll have a practice

04:07.360 --> 04:14.080
for nanny's sake show her what to do I didn't seek as an easy game not for nanny it isn't she's

04:14.080 --> 04:21.040

04:21.040 --> 04:27.840

04:28.560 --> 04:34.400

05:28.480 --> 05:33.280
I'm coming thank you

05:48.000 --> 05:50.960
oh my damn god you sniff

05:58.160 --> 06:04.960

06:10.560 --> 06:13.360
yes

06:28.160 --> 06:30.160
MMM?

06:30.160 --> 06:32.160
MMM?

06:32.160 --> 06:34.160
HMM?

06:34.160 --> 06:36.160
FHHHHH?!

06:36.160 --> 06:38.160
MMM?

06:38.160 --> 06:40.160
HMM?

06:40.160 --> 06:42.160
HMM?

06:42.160 --> 06:44.160
Got you, Little Mike!

06:44.160 --> 06:48.160
No! I'd like to know where Ninny's hiding!

06:51.160 --> 06:53.160
Oh, look!

06:53.160 --> 06:55.160
Oh!

06:58.160 --> 07:05.160
That! Come out, Nanny. I've got you. That was a good place. But I saw your ribbon.

07:05.160 --> 07:11.160
Oh! Now for snorkemaiden. She's always easy to find.

07:14.160 --> 07:17.160
Ha! That's only because she wants to be found!

07:17.160 --> 07:20.160
Found you snorkemaiden!

07:20.160 --> 07:22.160
Waaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn,

07:22.160 --> 07:34.160
Two, three, don't wait, nanny, this is my boy.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.160
Four.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.160
Hey, nanny, I'll show you a good place.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.160
Just come with your uncle stinky.

07:52.160 --> 08:04.160
Now don't worry, no one will find you there, it opens up once you're inside.

08:04.160 --> 08:07.160
Come on, it's a bit steep, I'll help you.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.160
Oh, stop!

08:21.160 --> 08:23.160
Right, that should keep you quiet.

08:23.160 --> 08:25.160
You're a bit too visible at the moment.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.160
Oh, let me out.

08:26.160 --> 08:30.160
But I'm sure if you stay here until tomorrow, no one will see it all.

08:30.160 --> 08:34.160
Please don't leave me here, please.

08:34.160 --> 08:36.160
No, it's...

08:44.160 --> 08:47.160
That's it, now tomorrow we'll hit the bank.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.160
Let me out.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.160
Please let me out.

09:01.160 --> 09:05.160
I'm very glad I thought of bringing nanny here.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.160
It's nice to have her here too, Tiki.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.160
She's no trouble at all.

09:09.160 --> 09:14.160
You're all pretty eccentric, and it might be just what she needs to make her want to be seen again.

09:14.160 --> 09:17.160
Oh, and you're very kind, of course.

09:17.160 --> 09:21.160
Well, thank you, I think I suppose we should be flattered, shouldn't we?

09:21.160 --> 09:23.160
Oh, yes, definitely.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.160
She started to talk, but her voice is very weak.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.160
You have to listen very carefully.

09:29.160 --> 09:32.160
Has it always been like that, or just since she was invisible?

09:32.160 --> 09:35.160
I'm not sure, I don't think it was like that before.

09:35.160 --> 09:40.160
Lots of people manage very well without using their heads, so I'm certain nanny will be all right.

09:40.160 --> 09:43.160
Yes, and I'm glad she's got movement in the others to play with.

09:43.160 --> 09:46.160
She's never had anybody before, you know.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.160
I think she'd find it a bit difficult to Tiki.

09:49.160 --> 09:53.160
Well, Mum and Mama, I think that all she needs is something to shock her out of it.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.160
Huh, got you a little, my.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.160
Oh, that bush was too prickly anyway.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.160
I expect I'm the last one, hey.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.160
No, I haven't found nanny yet.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.160
Nanny?

10:04.160 --> 10:06.160
I didn't think nanny would hide so well.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.160
Any luck, Sniff?

10:08.160 --> 10:10.160
There's nowhere else to look, Mum and.

10:10.160 --> 10:13.160
Perhaps she's lost or fallen or hurt herself.

10:13.160 --> 10:16.160
I've looked absolutely everywhere.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.160
I bet she's invisible again.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.160
That's why I can't find her.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.160
I bet Sniff hasn't looked everywhere.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.160
She can't be far.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.160
Do you know where she is, Mum?

10:26.160 --> 10:28.160
No, I haven't seen her at all.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.160
Not since we started.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.160
Nanny!

10:32.160 --> 10:34.160
Come on, we're going home.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.160
We've finished playing.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.160
Nanny!

10:37.160 --> 10:39.160
Oh, my goodness, where could she be?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.160
Nanny!

10:40.160 --> 10:42.160
It's your turn, Sniff, so you've got to find her.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.160
Nanny!

10:43.160 --> 10:45.160
Not once the game's over, I haven't.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.160
Never mind.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.160
We'll all look.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.160
We must find her.

10:48.160 --> 10:52.160
We are supposed to be looking after her, you know?

10:53.160 --> 10:55.160
Oh, come on, Nanny!

10:55.160 --> 10:57.160
The game's over, we've finished!

10:57.160 --> 10:58.160
Nanny!

10:58.160 --> 10:59.160
Nanny!

10:59.160 --> 11:00.160
Nanny!

11:00.160 --> 11:01.160
Hurry up!

11:01.160 --> 11:03.160
We're going home for cookies and lemonade!

11:03.160 --> 11:04.160
Nanny!

11:04.160 --> 11:05.160
Nanny!

11:19.160 --> 11:20.160
Nanny!

11:20.160 --> 11:21.160
Nanny!

11:21.160 --> 11:22.160
Nanny!

11:22.160 --> 11:24.160
Can you hear us?

11:24.160 --> 11:27.160
We weren't supposed to come this far, Snort Maiden.

11:27.160 --> 11:31.160
She might be really lost or frightened or anything.

11:31.160 --> 11:32.160
Nanny!

11:32.160 --> 11:34.160
Where are you, Nanny?

11:34.160 --> 11:35.160
Can you hear me?

11:35.160 --> 11:36.160
Nanny!

11:38.160 --> 11:39.160
Help!

11:39.160 --> 11:40.160
I'm over here!

11:40.160 --> 11:43.160
Did you hear something?

11:43.160 --> 11:45.160
I'm not sure.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.160
Help!

11:46.160 --> 11:47.160
Help!

11:47.160 --> 11:48.160
I'm here!

11:48.160 --> 11:49.160
Help!

11:50.160 --> 11:51.160
That's her!

11:51.160 --> 11:52.160
She's not far away!

11:52.160 --> 11:53.160
Nanny!

11:53.160 --> 11:55.160
Where are you?

11:55.160 --> 11:56.160
Here!

11:56.160 --> 11:58.160
Behind this rock!

11:58.160 --> 12:00.160
Where's her voice coming from?

12:00.160 --> 12:02.160
That way, I think.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.160
Nanny!

12:03.160 --> 12:05.160
I can't hear what you're saying!

12:05.160 --> 12:07.160
Try and shout a bit louder!

12:07.160 --> 12:09.160
I'm over here!

12:09.160 --> 12:10.160
Over here!

12:10.160 --> 12:12.160
Behind the rock!

12:12.160 --> 12:14.160
I still can't hear her properly!

12:14.160 --> 12:15.160
Louder, Nanny!

12:15.160 --> 12:16.160
Louder!

12:16.160 --> 12:18.160
Behind the rock!

12:18.160 --> 12:20.160
Which rock?

12:20.160 --> 12:21.160
Over here!

12:21.160 --> 12:23.160
The big rock!

12:25.160 --> 12:27.160
Over there!

12:27.160 --> 12:31.160
I've never shouted so much in my life!

12:31.160 --> 12:33.160
Nanny!

12:33.160 --> 12:36.160
Nanny, are you behind this rock, Nanny?

12:36.160 --> 12:37.160
Yes!

12:37.160 --> 12:39.160
Stinky block the cave with it!

12:39.160 --> 12:41.160
Don't worry, we'll get you out!

12:41.160 --> 12:43.160
Hang on!

12:49.160 --> 12:51.160
Are you alright, Nanny?

12:51.160 --> 12:52.160
Thank you, Mum!

12:52.160 --> 12:54.160
Oh, thank you!

12:55.160 --> 12:57.160
Your voice seems to be...

12:57.160 --> 12:58.160
Oh, what?

12:58.160 --> 13:00.160
Oh, nothing!

13:00.160 --> 13:03.160
Try and hold on to me, and I'll call you out!

13:03.160 --> 13:05.160
Oh, thank you!

13:11.160 --> 13:12.160
Hey!

13:12.160 --> 13:13.160
What's happened?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.160
Where's your finder?

13:14.160 --> 13:15.160
In the cave!

13:15.160 --> 13:16.160
Wow!

13:16.160 --> 13:19.160
What a brilliant hiding place had you find it!

13:22.160 --> 13:23.160
What's wrong?

13:23.160 --> 13:25.160
Did I say something funny?

13:27.160 --> 13:30.160
Now, that was very mean of Stinky's.

13:30.160 --> 13:33.160
A clever idea, though, of interuser for a van robbery.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.160
Oh, Papa!

13:34.160 --> 13:36.160
Oh, I know Stinky shouldn't have done it,

13:36.160 --> 13:40.160
and it must have been a nasty shopping trapped in the dark in that cave,

13:40.160 --> 13:43.160
but no real harm came to her, and she didn't disappear,

13:43.160 --> 13:45.160
and her voice got much stronger.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.160
You're so loud!

13:46.160 --> 13:48.160
Oh, goodness! Did you, dear?

13:48.160 --> 13:50.160
Yes, Mum and Mama!

13:50.160 --> 13:54.160
Mum told me to yell loudly, so he'd know where I was!

13:54.160 --> 13:56.160
And it was loud, too!

13:56.160 --> 13:58.160
Good for you, Nanny.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.160
It's surprising the things you can do if you have to,

14:00.160 --> 14:05.160
and you ought to remember that people who speak loudly are usually very noticeable.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.160
Go on, yo! I want to see it!

14:08.160 --> 14:10.160
That's a good idea, Nanny.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.160
If shouting brought back your voice,

14:12.160 --> 14:14.160
you never know it might be just what's needed to make the rest of you.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.160
Try and get angry, as well.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.160
Yeah, that's easy. Just think about Stinky.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.160
Yeah, and how horrible he is!

14:22.160 --> 14:25.160
That should make you angry. Very angry!

14:28.160 --> 14:30.160
Just your white Stinky!

14:30.160 --> 14:32.160
I can't help faster than me!

14:35.160 --> 14:37.160
Stinky, wait! We want to talk to you!

14:37.160 --> 14:39.160
I don't want to talk to you!

14:40.160 --> 14:42.160
Help! Help!

14:42.160 --> 14:44.160
Are you all right, Sniff?

14:46.160 --> 14:48.160
You can't get away, Stinky.

14:49.160 --> 14:52.160
The forest is my home ground! You won't catch me in here!

14:59.160 --> 15:02.160
Hold it.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.160
You can't do this to me!

15:04.160 --> 15:06.160
We're only doing what you did to Nanny.

15:06.160 --> 15:09.160
Now look, I needed her to help me. I did, I tell ya.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.160
But she didn't want to, huh?

15:12.160 --> 15:15.160
That's why I put her down this hole to change her mind.

15:15.160 --> 15:19.160
And scare her so much that she'd become totally invisible again.

15:19.160 --> 15:23.160
She had to be invisible for my plan. Now get me out of here!

15:23.160 --> 15:26.160
It's all right, Stinky. See you tomorrow!

15:26.160 --> 15:28.160
No! No!

15:36.160 --> 15:39.160
You crushed few things!

15:39.160 --> 15:42.160
I had such a wonderful plan!

15:42.160 --> 15:45.160
Ah, you're spiteful!

15:45.160 --> 15:48.160
Let's hear them my next job!

15:48.160 --> 15:53.160
But despite all that had happened, Nanny's face was still not to be seen.

15:56.160 --> 15:59.160
Then, about ten days later.

16:09.160 --> 16:12.160
This weather seems to push the nails out.

16:14.160 --> 16:17.160
I haven't seen anyone stare at the sea like Nanny does.

16:17.160 --> 16:20.160
Well, maybe she's never seen it before.

16:20.160 --> 16:28.160
Oh, she's crying now!

16:43.160 --> 16:45.160
What's the matter?

16:45.160 --> 16:48.160
It's the sea! It's far too big!

16:48.160 --> 16:51.160
You don't have to go on it, you know.

16:53.160 --> 16:56.160
Mama! Mama! What's up?

17:00.160 --> 17:02.160
What's the matter with her?

17:02.160 --> 17:07.160
Nothing to worry about. She's never seen the sea before and she's just surprised at how big it is.

17:10.160 --> 17:14.160
Well, there's an awful lot of water, that's for sure.

17:19.160 --> 17:24.160
Nanny's lucky. I wish there was something to surprise or excite me.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.160
Nothing's happened for weeks. Anything would be nice.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.160
Mama must be bored.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.160
I think you're right.

17:31.160 --> 17:32.160
But she never gets bored.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.160
Well, she is now. She needs something to happen.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.160
I think we should do something to surprise her.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.160
Like what?

17:40.160 --> 17:42.160
Well, I know what we can do.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.160
Well, tell me!

17:43.160 --> 17:46.160
We'll creep up behind her and just give her a little push.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.160
What, Papa? Push her into the sea?

17:49.160 --> 17:52.160
Oh, Papa, you can't. Mama wouldn't like it.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.160
Just watch me.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.160
But the water's freezing. A mama will get all wet.

17:56.160 --> 17:59.160
We never found the water too cold when we were your age.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.160
You young people today have no sense of fun.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.160
Did you really used to do things like that?

18:03.160 --> 18:05.160
All the time.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.160
Papa?

18:06.160 --> 18:07.160
Yes, Mumann.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.160
Oh, nothing.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.160
Don't worry, Mumann.

18:10.160 --> 18:14.160
It's always a prank. She'll find it very funny. I promise.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.160
Oh.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.160
I know you don't!

18:40.160 --> 18:42.160
No!

18:48.160 --> 18:51.160
Don't you dare push her into that big horrible sea.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.160
Let me explain to you.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.160
There's nothing to explain.

18:54.160 --> 18:57.160
You're a big bully. She'd have gone all wet.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.160
What a nasty trick.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.160
You could never...

19:10.160 --> 19:12.160
Nihini.

19:18.160 --> 19:21.160
There's her face! Hurry!

19:21.160 --> 19:25.160
That must be the sea.

19:27.160 --> 19:30.160
What on earth happened? Were you up to something?

19:30.160 --> 19:36.160
Oh, nothing much. You know that child has got the sharpest teeth with her without her head.

19:37.160 --> 19:40.160
Oh, Mumann. Mumann, at last I'm visible again.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.160
For always you won't disappear again.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.160
Never, never.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.160
Brave girl.

19:45.160 --> 19:47.160
And with a good strong set of healthy teeth too.

19:47.160 --> 19:50.160
Oh, I'm so happy, Nihini.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.160
Mimi dear.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.160
Mumann mother.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.160
I'm very glad too.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.160
Oh.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.160
Oh.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.160
Oh.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.160
Oh.

20:11.160 --> 20:13.160
Oh.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.160
Oh, you.

20:20.160 --> 20:25.160
Stop laughing, you horrible child. You used Sartuth monster.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.160
What's so funny, huh?

20:35.160 --> 20:37.160
Oh.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.160
Really, Nihini laughed.

20:54.160 --> 20:57.160
Well, she certainly changed, Mumann, Mama.

20:57.160 --> 21:00.160
All she needed was to get angry and she did.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.160
I hope Mumann Papa's forgiven, Nihini.

21:03.160 --> 21:06.160
Thank you all for taking such good care of her.

21:06.160 --> 21:09.160
I hate to say it, but she sounds almost as bad as it'll mine out.

21:11.160 --> 21:14.160
Tiki! Nihini!

21:19.160 --> 21:22.160
And so Nihini left Mumann house with Tiki.

21:22.160 --> 21:26.160
Now that she was completely visible and far from Timid,

21:26.160 --> 21:28.160
she was ready for anything.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.160
That is except seeing her aunt, she said.

21:50.160 --> 21:52.160
Boom!

21:59.160 --> 22:01.160
Boom!

22:06.160 --> 22:13.160
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

22:13.160 --> 22:20.160
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:20.160 --> 22:24.160
They're always happy and always at play.

22:24.160 --> 22:28.160
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:28.160 --> 22:31.160
The movements.

22:31.160 --> 22:35.160
The movements.

22:35.160 --> 22:42.160
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

22:42.160 --> 22:50.160
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:50.160 --> 22:54.160
They're always happy and always at play.

22:54.160 --> 22:58.160
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:58.160 --> 23:01.160
The movements.

23:01.160 --> 23:05.160
The movements.

23:05.160 --> 23:11.160
The movements.
