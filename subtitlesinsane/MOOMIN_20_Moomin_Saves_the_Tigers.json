Yes, and a lot of trouble he gave us as well. There's another one around here somewhere. We saw them. Yes, we know there is, but we haven't been able to find him yet. Oh, boy. I wish they'd come as quietly as you hippos did. Hippos? Hippos? Which do you from? I bet they'd pay well to get you back. Now look here, I'm a Mormon, not a hippo. Are you saying that I look like a hippo? Well, perhaps they don't look exactly like hippos. No, but they're close enough, Captain. I'm sure they've escaped from Azoo somewhere, though. Yes, sir. We haven't escaped from anywhere, certainly not Azoo. We live in Moomin Valley. We're Moomin's. It's all right, Snork Maiden. I'll not be taken for a hippo. Come on, let's run for it. Hey, wait. There's a nice cozy cage already for ya. Hurry, Snork Maiden. Ask to them. Stop them now. Don't let them get away. Where are we going, Mumin? Now to the sea. Quickly, man, lower the light boat. If they're not going to put us in any zoo. Why did you come back? I thought you were on the boat. Oh no! Don't worry, I never read anything when I'm not swimming. Are you sure? I'm sure I know where's this ship. Oh, they're catching up with us. They want to put us in a cage and take us to the zoo. Me too, I expect. They're always trying to get me. They've got one of the crocodiles. Oh, did they? They were my friends. Right. Hang on to me, I expect. They're always trying to get me. They've got one of the crocodiles. Oh, did they? They were my friends. Right. Hang on to me, you two. I'm certainly not going back to any zoo. Never, let's go. Oh no! Hold on tight. Come back! You horrible rascal! Come back! Moments been caught by a big snake. Yes, Mama snorked maiden as well. Dear stinky that's not true is it? I wish people wouldn't realize that I almost never lie. I'm sorry about them, but I thought I'd better tell you. Oh, there aren't any snakes that big in Momen Valley. There are tigers here right there. Well, there's big snakes too. You brought the snake here, didn't you? Papa, I'm not saying that I believe him, but I think we'd better look for them just to be on the safe side, don't you? Okay, don't believe me. I told you so my conscience is clear. We're exactly to the snake attack them, Stiggy. Down in the swamp by the sea. Let's go, mama. I'll come with you. No, you'd better stay little my until I'm moving where we've gone if he comes back. He'll only worry if there's no one here. And stinky, you show us where to go. Okay. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Big friend, please come in as much of you as you like. Stinky just told us that you and Snorkman had been caught by a big snake, so we... Where are you going, Stinky? She did chase us at first, then we managed to get on a boat, but they wanted to put us in a cage, so we jumped back in the sea, met the snake again, then they tried to catch her too, so she helped us to get away, and now she's our friend. Who are they? Men from the zoo. They've come to recapture all the animals and take them away from the jungle and put them in cages again. Nice. Secondly, don't want to go back to the zoo. Papa, we've got to protect our friends. Yes, we have. I'm sure that the tigers and that nice rhino don't want to go back even. Oh, of course they don't. They want to be free and live again our jungle. Why don't you go and explore it? I'm sure it'll to go back even. Oh, of course I don't. They want to be free and let begin our jungle. Why don't you go and explore it? I'm sure it'll be just like home. And if you see the zoo people, you can come back here, cut you. I'm sure you'll like it here, Mrs. Snake. Yes, I'm sure I will. Come on, I'll show you the jungle. Eh. I'm so relieved that you're both all right at home. So are we, Mama, but there's something we haven't told you. Yes, they thought we were hippopotamuses. What? Who did? They need their eyes, Destin. The men from the zoo. They thought we had escaped from another zoo, and we're trying to catch us, and they nearly succeeded. Now, a rude, well not at all like hippos, the cheek of it. So these men were only trying to capture our new friends, but you and Snork Maiden as well. And me and Papa if they'd known about us? That's right, Mama. There idiots. Hippopotamuses don't wear aprons or right memoirs. That's really made me angry. I bet they never faced the wrath of a movement papa before. I want to see you wrap yourself round and choke somebody. I know, how about the tiger? He do. I'd rather not, we became friends in the zoo. Oh, I know, choke stinky, that would be much better. Yes, my dewey did let us out of the zoo! Well, you're a great disappointment to me. I let you out because I thought you'd attack the movements, but you have tea with them instead. You're pathetic, you know that? I'm sorry, but we were brought up in captivity, and we never had to hunt for our food. All our meals are brought to us, you see. But your tigers, what do you eat, them? Well, we love cat food. Cat food. Oh, I don't believe it. Yes, it's easy to chew, and it leaves our fur all sleep and shiny. We like the yellow tins with the black cat. Don't we, honey? Yes, it's our favorite. You wouldn't happen to have any on you, would you? Mama! Pop-, quickly! They're here! The zoo men are here! Get all the animals into the house first, you! Hurry, moment! Okay, Papa. The zoo men have come to get you! Hurry, you'll be safe in the moment house. Quick as you can, Rhino, into the house. Go on. Now, Rhino, push him. I'm sorry. Oh, my God. Um, I don't think that's a good place to hide, Mrs. Snake. I'm afraid that doesn't look quite right, Tiger. I thought I might just look like a thick rug. I'll just lie here like a beautiful porcelain ornament. They'll never know we're here, darling. Well, they'd never expect to find a rhino under there. That's what I thought. Where are they? They can't just have vanished into thin air. Hmm. Look, up there! In the chimney. So they're in there, are they? Papa! They've seen the snake! They're nearly here! Now I want you to calm down and be quiet, everyone. We won't let them take you away. I promise you they'll have a fight on the hands if they try. Teeth, please, my love. Of course, dear. We won't let them take you away. I promise you they'll have a fight on the hands if they try. Teeth, please, my love. A poor steer. Hello? Hello? Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Having a picnic are you? It's lovely day for you. Not at all. We're all here from the zoo, sir. Oh, are you on some sort of expedition? Excuse me, but are you the owner of this house? Yes, indeed I am. I'm movement pop-o. Well, why could I do for you? Why, you could send out the animals hiding in your house. That'll do for a start. Animals? Oh, no. We have firm believers that they belong outside. Sir, you can't see from where you are, but I can assure you that there is a python sticking its head out of your chimney. A python? Yes, that's right. No, it isn't. It isn't. No, it's my daughter. She happens to look like a python. Not all the time you understand. Right, come on, man. We'll go and get the zoo's property. No, you will not enter my house. All right, well, you let the animals out. We won't have to. It's up to you, sir. There are no animals, and you won't enter my house. Now, wait a minute. I do believe, yes, you're one of those hippos, aren't you? I am not. I'm movement papa, and I am the owner of this house. No, you're not. You're a hippopotamus. How dare? A hippo who owns a house, and it's also running an illegal zoo. Break down the doors. You're not your hippopotamus, how dare? A hippo who owns a house, and it's also running in an illegal zoo! Break down the doors! Huh, that is against the law! Oh it is, isn't? Well, there's a nice cage winning for you as well, woman, pop a hippo. I warn you, if you touch that door, you'll regret it. Go, yeah? Great boys, let's go in! Charge! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, have you know that's willful destruction of property, my good man? It's not willful, we're from the zoo. We gotta get in somehow. Oh, have you, and can you be sure that there are zoo animals in there? You just take a look up there at the chimney. That's all I'm sure. Go on. See that python's head sticking out? That's all. I can't see a python's head sticking out? That's odd. I can't see a python's head. But there was a python's head up there, I saw it! Ugh, I can't breathe. Now you're listening to me, zoom in. Either you stop bothering my friends or I'll arrest you. Is that clear? Well, is it? Yes, sir it is. but what about the zoo animals? You heard the inspector now go away. Do you see that? See what? The hippopotamus. What? The hippopotamus. He's a fellow's been hiding all our zoo animals. We got a nice cage lined up for him as well inspector. Oh so that's your plan, is it? Ha, they want to take them all. Moomin's, Nork, Me, Mama, and Papa. Hmm, the criminal conspiracy. Conspiracy? It would probably be called kidnapping. Once you can't kidnap a hippo? That's a movement! It could be white slavery, though. I'm sure I could add incitement to riot to the list. Now, I hate paperwork, so I'll tell you one. If you're gone within 10 minutes, I won't arrest you. Why don't you put them in the deepest dungeon, Inspector? The one with all the rats and spiders and scorpions that'll teach them to put mullens and cages. That's a good idea, little mind. They like animals. I'll start counting now. One, two, three. Get around men quickly. We'll have to think quickly on this one, men. Come on now, does anybody have any smart ideas? Come on, we're running out of time! One minute! Look guys, we're gonna figure something out right now! Ready and look! One minute, thirty seconds! Two minutes! Three minutes, thirty seconds! Look! Leave us alone, way we're conferring. Alright, six minutes and fifty seconds. Time's up. You're cheating. The police don't cheat, and now you've got... Nine minutes and thirty seconds. How about that? Nine minutes, fifty bucks? I give up! Everybody beat it! But we're still discussing it. No, we're not. We're getting out. Look, everyone, the zoom in, they're running off. Great. You've got to come and see this, Mama. No, it's $50.5 seconds. And don't come back. We'll be the dungeon for you. And I make that 10 minutes up to you. You saved his little mind. It was really clever of you to fetch the inspector. Well, there were too many of them for me to fight. Okay, everyone, keep the money out! Oh, oh, oh, yeah! And so everyone was saved, and eventually they all came out of the house to go and have fun in the jungle again. As long as the warm weather lasted, there were plenty of things to do, but one day the weather changed, and cold winds blew down Moomin Valley. Ugh, it feels like autumn has arrived. The jungle won't like the cold weather. Do you think it will die, Mama? I'm afraid it will, little my. It grew very quickly, so perhaps it will go the same way. And it did. The whole jungle with it and died in just one night. I think I've done a cold coming, Mama. I'm sorry, I can't get the house any hotter. I missed the zoo, at least it was warm now. Yes, this cold is awful It would warm them up if we weren't the dead jungle Now they're happy again. But for how long? Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys. It's cold again. It was warm in our cages. What are you afraid here? Yes, free to have pneumonia. I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spending the winter here. And so all the animals decided to return to the zoo. I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spending the winter here. And so all the animals decided to return to the zoo. Perhaps we'll like to come back next summer, Mrs. Snake. I like that when it's warmer. Hey, look, the animals are on their way back! Oh, Ray! That wonderful! Oh, it's good to see you. Hey look the animals are on their way back! Alright! That wonderful! Oh it's good to see you! You don't know how much we missed you! Oh good! Gosh! Welcome back Rhino O'Fallets! It's good to see you! Come on now! Get back to your cages quickly! We've been keeping them nice and warm for you! Go on off your go now! You look alright but I'm sure you must all be starving. We'll do you a special meal tonight, alright? Ah, the hippos too! For the last time, we're movements, not hippos. You must be cold as well. We'll warm up a cage for you. It'll be nice and cozy there. No. No, it just came to send the animals off. Hey, get a cage ready for the hippos. Well, you're nice and warm. At the risk of sounding repetitive, we are movements. Don't be ridiculous, you mullet here. But we're nothing like hippos. We know you're not purebred, but the public will never be able to tell. Do we have to stay here forever, Papa? Of course not, Momen. Don't worry, I'll think of something. You will, won't you? Have you got any ideas? Well, not yet, but I am a writer, you know. Don't cry, Snorth maiden. I'm sure there won't be only, hey, to eat. I don't mind as long as we're together but what if they put us in separate cages? Oh! That would be awful. They wouldn't do that. Well perhaps the inspector will come looking for us. When he realizes that we've gone as well as the animals he'll bring the full power of the Lord to bear on them. Oh look there's someone coming. It's Snoughkin! And Hamulun! And a little Mai! Snoughkin! Hi, Moomin. Don't worry. We'll have you guys out in just a minute. Please come out. Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to let you out. I'm in charge of this zoo. I'm afraid it was quite an understandable mistake, but please accept this token of apology from the Board of Trustees. Here you are, madam. Mr. Hemmielin and I went to the Royal Academy of Science just to sort all this out. We've been given a letter from the President stating that you are not hippos. Mr. Hamillon's scientific background helped persuade him. So you can all come home now. Well, it just goes to show you must never judge by appearances alone. Mama. Yes, Papa? Do you think I should grow a beard? No, Papa. Do you think I should grow a beard? No, Papa. And so autumn came to Moomin Valley, a new season with different weather and different pleasures. They love the laughter and they love the living the moments Believing in sharing and caring and giving the moments They're always happy and always at play The movements are having fun day after day The movements The movements They love the laughter and they love the living The movements They're leaving and sharing and caring The moon, the moment"
