0	21000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here for you are your TV, there are the movements, there are the movements.
29000	36000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land.
36000	46000	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,
46000	58000	there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.
76000	106000	La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
106000	136000	Snort Maiden is running as if the groke is chasing her. I don't think I've ever seen her run so fast. I wonder what's the matter? Perhaps something terrible has happened.
136000	166000	Now come down and tell us what's wrong. My brother's on the cliff and then he's about to jump off. What snort? Are you sure? He says nothing will prevent him doing it. Oh, police, you must stop him, moment. Did you say that you wanted me to help you with something snort Maiden? Yes, I want you to stop snort jumping off the cell side of the cliff. Oh dear, I never thought he was the type. He says it's a test flight.
166000	196000	Oh. Now what? A test flight, did you say? Snort Maiden, do you mean that he's finally finished building his flying ship? No, only the blueprint. At least I think that's all. He doesn't tell me. Well, that's a start. He built a small model of the flying ship's wings and they don't look strong enough to carry anyone. And now he's going to try them out himself to see if they'll work. And I know they won't. They'll break, you know. Now wait a minute, Snort Maiden. Slow down and let me think.
196000	226000	He's made the wings from the blueprint of the flying ship. Well, his plans are always very accurate. Oh, Papa, you've got to stop him. The cell side, Papa. Yes, I know the highest and steepest one of all. Oh, moment, Papa, there must be something we can do. Yes, I'm sure there is. Right. Hurry, everybody. There's no time to lose. Come on. Oh, thank you, moment, Papa.
226000	233000	â€¦No! Go!
256000	273000	A snork? Wait! Wait! Please! Stop snork, don't do it! Why have you brought everybody
273000	278000	here, snork maiden? They've come to beg you not to do it. You're too young and brilliant
278000	284000	for such a tragic end. Thank the bubble we were in time. As a matter of fact, you weren't.
284000	291000	Oh, really? It looks very dangerous to me, snork. Well, it's not at all moving, Papa. I made these wings
291000	300000	myself. They're perfectly balanced. Well, yes, I'm sure they are. The blueprints are detailed and precise. They're quite safe.
300000	305000	Tell me, snork. Why did you stop on the edge like that after running down the slope?
305000	312000	I was measuring the right length from my approach run. Don't do it, snork. I don't want to lose my only brother.
312000	320000	Don't make such a fuss, snork maiden. Do you really think it's safe? Of course it is. You don't see birds falling out of the sky, do you?
320000	326000	Well, at least do your test flight just above the ground so that if something happens to go wrong, you'll hurt yourself.
326000	334000	I've already done that from the roof of our house and it worked beautifully. Did you see him? No, I didn't see anything.
334000	340000	Of course you didn't. Do you think I let a wimpy little sister watch me? What's that supposed to mean, snork?
340000	346000	Just that I don't want you sticking your big nose into my affairs all the time. I don't like it, and there's nothing to do with you.
346000	352000	Yours is just as big and I don't want to lose you. Don't go on about losing me. Why not?
352000	354000	Come on now, you two. Stop it.
354000	360000	Hey! Oops! That was close. Snork maiden, I don't think your brother is going to be stopped.
360000	364000	Oh dear, oh dear. You're very brave, snork.
364000	374000	Hmm, right. Here we go. This time it'll be a perfect takeoff.
374000	378000	It's a long way. Oh look, isn't that snuffkin down there?
378000	381000	Where? Where is he? Where is snuffkin?
381000	384000	You can't see him from there, Sniff. You'll have to come here.
384000	390000	Is it really snuffkin? Yes, I'm sure it is. Snuffkin!
390000	394000	Yeah! Baby, here you...
394000	396000	No, I don't think so.
396000	400000	All right, here goes! Good luck, snork!
400000	402000	All right.
417000	419000	He's flying!
430000	440000	It's the snork!
461000	464000	Look at him flying.
464000	470000	It's all right, snork maiden. Your brother's doing fine. Come and see.
470000	474000	He's done it! He's done it!
474000	478000	Wow, I know he could do it. Well, so did I, to be honest.
478000	482000	Huh? Yeah, snork!
482000	488000	Hello!
488000	492000	Hi! How are you doing?
492000	496000	It's great that this test flight is a great success.
512000	522000	Okay, just as I thought he can't fly and wave at the same time.
522000	526000	Interesting. That was mean, stinky.
526000	529000	If I could get him to wave with both arms, you'd probably fall.
529000	534000	Look, we don't want you here, stinky. Why don't you just go away?
534000	537000	I can find lots to do with that machine.
537000	540000	If you won't go away, I will.
540000	544000	Well, go on then, Snuffkin. What do I care what you do?
544000	548000	Hmm, that would be perfect for robberies.
548000	552000	The wind seems to be taking him out to sea.
552000	554000	Why doesn't he turn around and come back?
554000	557000	Turning in that thing might not be so easy.
557000	559000	What? Do you mean he can't?
559000	562000	Well, don't worry, snork maiden. Of course he can.
562000	567000	Oh, what's this I can't turn on!
567000	569000	Oh!
577000	579000	Oh, he's hit a tree.
579000	581000	Come on, hurry!
598000	600000	Oh!
603000	606000	Is he dead?
606000	608000	No, he's been knocked out.
608000	612000	He looks dead to me anyway. Where are they? What's happened to the wings?
612000	614000	In the tree.
614000	617000	Ah, he won't want them anymore, so now I can have them.
617000	620000	Now, let me see.
628000	632000	So, did the test flight go all right?
632000	635000	Will someone tell me what happened?
635000	639000	Well, it was fine until the very end.
639000	642000	I'm sure that you only need a bit more practice.
642000	645000	Flying isn't the easiest thing to master, you know.
645000	650000	I expect so. Let's hope you don't run out of bandages, though.
651000	653000	Excuse me, snork.
653000	655000	Hmm?
655000	657000	Are you going to use the wings anymore?
657000	659000	I might not. Why?
659000	662000	Oh, well, I'll have them if you don't want them.
662000	664000	I want to fly in the sky, too.
664000	667000	It looks the most exciting thing I've ever seen.
667000	669000	Oh, please let me have them.
669000	672000	Well, it's not as simple as that moment.
672000	675000	They need testing before the design is done.
675000	678000	Well, it's not as simple as that moment.
678000	681000	They need testing before the design is complete.
681000	685000	But I could do that snork. I know I could do it. Please let me have them.
685000	688000	Well, I suppose I could do with some help.
688000	691000	There's a lot to do, fetching and carrying mostly.
691000	694000	You haven't said if I can have the wings or not yet, snork.
694000	696000	Yes, you can, but on one condition.
696000	698000	Anything.
698000	702000	Well, now the blueprints are finished and the wings are more or less right.
702000	708000	I'll need somewhere to build the ship and somewhere to store all the materials so they'll be dry and at hand.
708000	711000	Yes, you will snork. I can see that.
711000	715000	It doesn't have to be much, just a roof will do or and walls.
715000	719000	So that people can't spy on me and steal my ideas.
719000	724000	I can do the building myself, but I'll need some help and when it's finished, you can have the wings.
724000	730000	Great. I'd love to help you. I'd have done that anyway, but now that I can have the wings, I'll work twice as hard.
730000	733000	You won't regret it, snork. I promise you you won't.
733000	736000	Splendid, woman. That settled them.
736000	741000	Perhaps we can get more help. I'm sure that'll be easy. How about it, snuffkin?
741000	743000	Yes, of course.
743000	745000	Will you help us do sniff?
745000	747000	Yes, but I want something too.
747000	750000	I'll let you borrow the wings.
750000	754000	No, I'm far too heavy. I only break them.
754000	758000	Don't worry, sniff. I'm sure I'll think of something you can have.
758000	763000	Oh, as long as it's something nice. Oh, I do love helping people.
763000	767000	You're all heart-sniff. We know that for sure.
770000	775000	I'm sure you'll need some expert help with the shed, snork.
785000	787000	Surely this must be deep enough, Papa?
787000	794000	Oh, no. Lee Moment's always built for posterity. Besides, I like pouring cement.
794000	796000	Okay, Papa.
811000	814000	I've given your present a lot of fortune, all.
814000	815000	Huh?
815000	819000	And I think I'll give you one of my invaluable books on machinery.
819000	822000	Oh? Don't you want it?
822000	826000	Well, if there was something else, I'm not much of a reader.
826000	830000	What about my invaluable fountain pen?
830000	832000	Invaluable fountain pen?
832000	834000	What about my invaluable...
834000	837000	Do you have anything that's not invaluable, snork?
837000	840000	Well, what about a gold coin?
840000	843000	Well, that sounds great. A real gold coin?
843000	846000	Oh, boy, yes, that's a deal.
866000	869000	You are digging a very deep hole.
869000	872000	Oh, why don't you stop and have some sandwiches?
872000	875000	Should we do that, Papa? Go on.
875000	877000	Yes, I think we can stop now.
877000	879000	Sniff and your brother are in the woods.
879000	881000	Yes, I know. I heard them.
888000	890000	Hi, snork maiden.
892000	894000	Oh, no.
894000	897000	Wait a minute. I want to ask you something.
897000	898000	What is it?
898000	902000	Tell me, snork maiden, is it true that your brother gave those wings to a woman?
902000	906000	Yes, it is. He's helping snork to build the shed his payment.
906000	911000	I thought they'd been broken up. They hit that tree very hard.
911000	913000	Well, my brother's repairing them.
913000	916000	Will you let me pass? I've got to take his lunch to him.
916000	918000	And will he be able to repair them?
918000	921000	He can repair anything.
922000	924000	Mmm.
924000	927000	Gosh, what a lot of wood you've got.
927000	931000	Well, the shed has to be a lot bigger than my flying ship.
931000	934000	Moving and moving Papa are digging holes. They sure are deep.
934000	939000	Everybody's being very kind, very kind indeed.
941000	945000	Mama's cooking and Snuffkin's gone to get nails.
945000	948000	There are some other things I need him to get as well.
948000	950000	Will you write them down?
951000	954000	Of course I will, snork. Oh, you're such a planner.
954000	958000	Well, I'm afraid all famous inventors have to be.
968000	974000	Whether it was Snork's planning or the fact that everyone in Moomin Valley helped in some way or other,
974000	978000	the hangar or boat house was finished in record time.
980000	982000	I'm going to take a look.
982000	984000	I'm going to take a look.
984000	986000	I'm going to take a look.
986000	988000	I'm going to take a look.
988000	990000	I'm going to take a look.
990000	992000	I'm going to take a look.
992000	994000	I'm going to take a look.
994000	996000	I'm going to take a look.
996000	998000	I'm going to take a look.
998000	1000000	I'm going to take a look.
1000000	1002000	I'm going to take a look.
1002000	1004000	I'm going to take a look.
1004000	1006000	I'm going to take a look.
1006000	1008000	I'm going to take a look.
1019000	1021000	Here.
1021000	1024000	Moomin's here.
1024000	1026000	Come in, Moomin!
1026000	1029000	Thank you for all your help.
1029000	1032000	You did so much that these wings are hardly paymented enough.
1032000	1034000	But if you're happy with them,
1034000	1037000	Oh no, it was great fun building the shed.
1037000	1041000	I changed the design a bit, so it's easier to take off and land,
1041000	1044000	and turning shouldn't be a problem anymore.
1044000	1048000	You must remember to give yourself plenty of time though, woman.
1048000	1051000	Thank you, Snork. I can't wait to try them out.
1051000	1053000	I'm so excited. I don't think I'll sleep tonight.
1053000	1055000	Are you trying them out tomorrow?
1055000	1058000	As soon as I can. You will be careful.
1058000	1062000	You must practice a lot just above the ground to get used to wearing them
1062000	1064000	before you try to go too high.
1064000	1066000	I don't want anything to happen to you.
1066000	1068000	Well, practice, I promise.
1074000	1076000	Where are you going to practice tomorrow?
1076000	1078000	I haven't decided.
1080000	1083000	I'll find somewhere when I come out tomorrow,
1083000	1085000	perhaps on that small hill near the cliff.
1085000	1087000	But that can't be too dangerous.
1087000	1089000	I'll see you there.
1093000	1095000	Hey!
1100000	1102000	Hey!
1123000	1125000	Hey!
1137000	1140000	Hi, Moments! Where have you put the wings?
1143000	1145000	On the table outside.
1145000	1148000	You must have gone past them if you came in through the veranda door.
1149000	1152000	No, I didn't. They're not there.
1152000	1154000	What?
1158000	1161000	Oh no, you're right. They're gone.
1162000	1164000	Oh dear, I thought it was my friend.
1164000	1166000	What's happened to them?
1166000	1167000	Somebody stole them.
1167000	1170000	What's the matter with you, too? Is something wrong?
1170000	1173000	Yes, somebody stole and Moments wings.
1173000	1176000	Well, perhaps they haven't been stolen.
1177000	1180000	Of course they have, and I bet I know who did it, too.
1180000	1182000	Come on!
1182000	1184000	Where are we going? Do you know where they are?
1192000	1194000	It's stinky.
1194000	1197000	Oh, yeah. Well, it certainly didn't take you long.
1197000	1200000	Just a minute, stinky. Those are my wings.
1200000	1203000	See? I knew it was him.
1204000	1207000	Stop! You horrible creature!
1207000	1209000	I certainly will back.
1209000	1211000	If you give them back, stinky.
1211000	1213000	I'll let you try them out later.
1213000	1214000	I promise.
1214000	1216000	No way, boom, in their mind now.
1216000	1218000	I'm going to be a high-flier.
1218000	1220000	Look out, moving!
1223000	1225000	Oh, stop!
1225000	1227000	There we go!
1227000	1229000	You're pathetic.
1229000	1232000	The wings are mine.
1232000	1235000	I'll become a master criminal now.
1237000	1239000	All rotten seabing.
1239000	1242000	You shouldn't have left them outside, Moments.
1242000	1245000	Yeah, but who'd think let each steal them?
1245000	1247000	Where his friends? Well, almost.
1247000	1250000	I didn't think even stinky would do something like that.
1250000	1251000	Well, he did, didn't he?
1251000	1253000	Now, don't worry, Moments.
1253000	1256000	We'll find him and get them back. I know it.
1262000	1265000	Look, Moments. Now he's going towards the sea.
1268000	1270000	Oh, no, turn around.
1270000	1273000	But stinky didn't know how to maneuver the wings.
1273000	1276000	It was taken further and further out.
1278000	1281000	Turn around, we'll get turned back.
1281000	1283000	Until?
1284000	1286000	Oh!
1290000	1292000	You're at least he's having a bath for once.
1292000	1294000	The wings will be badly damaged.
1294000	1297000	Never mind. Snark will build another pair.
1297000	1300000	I sure hope so.
1314000	1316000	Oh!
1327000	1334000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the moments.
1334000	1341000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the moments.
1342000	1345000	They're always happy and always at play.
1345000	1349000	The movements are having fun day after day.
1349000	1353000	The movements.
1353000	1357000	The movements.
1357000	1364000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the moments.
1364000	1370000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the moments.
