# Moomin Universe



## Project Description 
*This is a student group project (Group 8) for the Social Network Analysis course in 2025 spring.*

Our project will have a social network representing the relationships between characters in the Moomin universe. 

This provides a unique, locally (Finland) relevant network to explore friendships, family, and community within a beloved Finnish cultural export. It's novel as it would be a network constructed from a fictional universe, specifically focusing on Finnish literature.

Data will be primarily collected from the official Moomin website and transcripts/animations, specifically limited to the Finnish version and the first season (1990-1992).

Edges will represent the relationships between Moomin characters, weighted based on the strength and type of their connection (e.g., familial, friendly, antagonistic).

The nodes will be individual characters within the Moomin universe, such as Moomintroll, Snufkin, Little My, Moominmamma, and other figures.
