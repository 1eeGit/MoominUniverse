1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They hear for you on your TV.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So what do you think?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. with me, they're here for you on your TV, they are the moments, they are the moments,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:01:50,000
sing that song ever, there were the moments, there were the movements, there was the movements, there was the movements, there was the movements La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la It's the middle of winter in Moomin Valley and all is quiet and peaceful in Moomin House

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,040
is everybody enjoys their winter slumber.

13
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,659
The house is full of dust covers, on the chandelier, on the furniture, on everything, waiting

14
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:05,400
until they all wake up again on the first day of spring and start to get everything in movement house clean

15
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,000
and ready for the coming summer.

16
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,080
But what's this?

17
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,000
It looks like movement is restless as if something has disturbed

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,080
him.

19
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,800
I wonder what he was dreaming about.

20
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,199
I wonder what time it is.

21
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,479
Oh, it's nearly 20 after, too.

22
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:46,719
Wonder whether it's morning or afternoon.

23
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,879
It doesn't really matter, I suppose.

24
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,879
Oh, it stopped.

25
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,919
Oh, it's frozen.

26
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:07,000
It looks really dark out there. Mama, please wake up.

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Papa, Papa, Mama, Mama, Mama, what's wrong with me?

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I feel way too weak.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, what's wrong with me?

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,159
I feel way too weak. Papa, papa, mama, mama, mama, what's wrong with me?

31
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:47,000
I feel way too weak. Oh, dear. The whole house is buried in snow.

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh, dear.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The whole house is buried in snow.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, dear.

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The whole house is buried in snow.

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, dear.

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,599
The whole house is buried in snow!

38
00:04:21,800 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh! Oh Ah! This doesn't look like Moomin Valley.

39
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And it's so quiet.

40
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What was that?

41
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Perhaps I better go home.

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No, what's the matter with me?

43
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Everyone's asleep and the furniture's all covered up and the movements don't give up.

44
00:05:42,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I wish Nuffkin were here. He's probably in the far south where it's warm and sunny. I wonder what that is.

45
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh, I wonder. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

46
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, my God.

47
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh, my God.

48
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh, my God.

49
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh, my God.

50
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, my God.

51
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, my God.

52
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, my God.

53
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, my God.

54
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, my God.

55
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,120
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh yes, it's little Mai! By the bobo, what are you doing here, Moomin?

56
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,639
What am I doing here?

57
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,319
I heard strange noises and came to see what it was.

58
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,519
Then you crashed in and be like an avalanche,

59
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,439
and I've just lifted the box off you.

60
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,040
Oh, don't be stupid, Moomin.

61
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,720
I mean, why are you out in the snow

62
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,519
and not hibernating like the others?

63
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,160
Spring's not for ages.

64
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,720
Oh, I don't know.

65
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,319
I just woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.

66
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,319
But what about you, sliding about like that, you should be asleep too.

67
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,879
Yes, I should, but I just woke up as well.

68
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,120
Probably to look after you.

69
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,519
I tried to wake my stupid sister, but she kept on snoring.

70
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,759
But I think this snow is really great.

71
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,079
Well, I don't.

72
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,279
It's cold, it's slippy, much too bright, and it's everywhere and far too quiet.

73
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,040
I saw the grog.

74
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,399
Huh?

75
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,959
That horrible freezing monster?

76
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,120
She should feel at home in this, and there's no point in her trying to freeze anything.

77
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,639
I saw her on the hill.

78
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,399
Then it was her voice, I heard.

79
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,759
Yes, and the trouble with the horrid thing is that she's so cold I wouldn't even want to touch her movement.

80
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,360
Huh! It's her!

81
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Ah!

82
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,240
I'm getting cold shivers all over.

83
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,279
Well, why do you expect in the snow?

84
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,519
No, it's the Groke's Fall. She's done it.

85
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,720
Look at my skin, it's all goose bumpy.

86
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,000
It's not like that in the summer. It's smooth, not lumpy. It's not the snow that makes me feel so cold. It's her staring at me.

87
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm scared.

88
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That was great.

89
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Good, isn't it? You can have as much as you like.

90
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We picked more raspberries than ever this year.

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The mama made lots of juice. Thanks. That was great. Good, isn't it? You can have as much as you like.

92
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We picked more raspberries than ever this year

93
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and Mama made lots of juice.

94
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Thanks.

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh.

96
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Ah!

97
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I want that.

98
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Mama's silver tray?

99
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah.

100
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What do you want it for?

101
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
To slide on the snow with a coarse stupid?

102
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,600
But it's a sort of family treasure in heirloom.

103
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,679
Well you never use it and it's so shiny.

104
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,840
It'll make a great sled and go really fast.

105
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,480
Doesn't look like they'll wake up till spring.

106
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,440
They're lucky, they're still sleeping.

107
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,200
I think it's very unfair that I woke up like this

108
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:45,500
So what should we do now? I want to go look at mind. You can use it as a boat anyway and it would sink. Yes, you could. What? How? Oh, look!

109
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,000
There's the sink!

110
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,000
But it's all frozen!

111
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,500
So we'll be able to slide on it!

112
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:28,000
What's that over there? Oh Huh? Huh?

113
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Huh? Toe-tiki!

114
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Hello, you two.

115
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You're not hibernating, either?

116
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh, no.

117
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I haven't got time to spend four months sleeping.

118
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Why not?

119
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Little Mayan, I just woke up and now we don't know what to do.

120
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,080
I'm sure you can think of something.

121
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,240
You suppose so? I've never seen the sea frozen before.

122
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Did you make that horse too, Tiki?

123
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,399
Yes I did. Can I sit on it?

124
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,919
No you can't. I need it for the lady of the cold.

125
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,360
Oh I see. I suppose you've heard of her.

126
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,360
Yes she's very beautiful but if she looks into eyes, you're turned into a block of ice.

127
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,039
She's not a very nice lady.

128
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,320
That's right, little Maya and Sprink can never come while she's here.

129
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,919
It waits for her to go.

130
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,960
Oh, I see.

131
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,919
And are you hoping she'll ride away on this horse then?

132
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Yes, and it will take her back to the north,

133
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,600
where she stays until she comes here again next winter and drives the sun away.

134
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,320
The horse doesn't look very solid to me, Tutiki.

135
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,240
Well, that's why I'm going to pour water over it when it gets really cold and then it'll

136
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,519
be solid.

137
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,639
When is the lady of the cold coming?

138
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:57,000
You can never tell, but soon, tonight perhaps, it feels much colder already.

139
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What's happened to the sun, Tiki?

140
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Do you know when the sun will come back again?

141
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's in the south shining on Snuffkin, but it'll be back soon,

142
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and then it will stay a bit longer each day.

143
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Good, I can't wait.

144
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Now there'll be a full moon tonight,

145
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and we'll be able to see everything.

146
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Great! I can get my tray up!

147
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I can't wait to try it on the sea!

148
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What do you mean, your tray?

149
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Well, let's move in, Mama's tray,

150
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
but I'm using it.

151
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm gonna put a sail on it and slide across the ice.

152
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Why not wait till tomorrow?

153
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Wait until tomorrow?

154
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No. When I want to do something, I do it now.

155
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What if the ice suddenly melts or something?

156
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Eh.

157
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah!

158
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I like it here. It's warm and cozy.

159
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,360
I hope Moomin' Papa doesn't mind me using it.

160
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,519
This is Papa's bathhouse.

161
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,919
He build it himself and he'd be very glad to know

162
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,440
you're using it.

163
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,080
It's great, the window paints are different colors.

164
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,480
If you look out through one, the world is red

165
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,919
and through another one, the world is green.

166
00:12:58,919 --> 00:12:59,919
Mm-hmm.

167
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,919
Mm-hmm.

168
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,919
Mm-hmm.

169
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:02,919
Mm-hmm.

170
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:03,919
Mm-hmm.

171
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,919
Mm-hmm.

172
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:10,379
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hahaha!

173
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:11,159
Oh!

174
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:13,200
You don't hibernate either, do you?

175
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:18,080
Now Scram! The horrible lady of the cold is coming and if she looks you in the eye, you'll turn to ice!

176
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,840
Go on!

177
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:25,000
Go away! Mumin! Two-tiggy! Mumin! Mumin! Dad, take it right out!

178
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Little Mike, we're over here.

179
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Huh?

180
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm going to get you a little bit more.

181
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm going to get you a little bit more.

182
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm going to get you a little bit more.

183
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm going to get you a little bit more.

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm going to get you a little bit more.

185
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm going to get you a little bit more.

186
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm going to get you a little bit more.

187
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm going to get you a little bit more.

188
00:13:44,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm going to get you a little bit more. I'm going to get you a little bit more. MUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM I'd better go see what she's doing to Mama Silver Trey. Okay.

189
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Ah, got one.

190
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh dear me.

191
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
She's cold and wet under that ice.

192
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,039
How are you doing, little mime?

193
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,240
Very well, thank you.

194
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,080
How can you get under the ice anyway?

195
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,080
I guess the water must be low and there's a gap left there.

196
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Oh, how?

197
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,320
I don't know, but perhaps the tide was in when the sea froze

198
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,480
and some of it got stuck to the shore.

199
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,559
Oh, I suppose it's possible.

200
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:48,000
Do take you told me that she has fish soup every day in the winter time?

201
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I know. I'll go see if the horse is frozen yet.

202
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Make sure you shut the door behind you.

203
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, my thumb! I don't think it's hard enough yet. It'll collapse if the lady of the coke gets on it now.

204
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh, it's getting colder and colder. The Grooke.

205
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Don't tell me you want to ride the horse.

206
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't think you'd better. This is for the lady of the cold, you know.

207
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
There's no telling what she'd do to you.

208
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:16,600
Look you in the eye, probably.

209
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,600
Even the groke is frightened of the lady of the cold.

210
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,000
Ah, now it looks frozen.

211
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Wee! Ha-ha!

212
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yee-hee!

213
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Wee!

214
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yee-ha!

215
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Great, isn't it, movement?

216
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah, that old tray really moves.

217
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Wanna go?

218
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No thanks, I'm too big.

219
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Come on, now, the fish soup is ready and it's time you were inside of the fish soup. Yeah, that old tray really moves. Want to go? No thanks, I'm too big.

220
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Come on, now the fish soup is ready and it's time you were inside, little my.

221
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Keep it warm for me, I'm having another go.

222
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No, little my.

223
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Why not?

224
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Have you forgotten what I told you the lady of the cold may be coming?

225
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh.

226
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Well, I want to see her, I'm not scared of her. I'll be moving so fast she won't get a chance.

227
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
No. Now listen to me a little, Mai.

228
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
All you have to do is not let her look you in the eye.

229
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But what happens if you're not quick enough and she catches you before you turn away?

230
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I know. If we watch her from the bathhouse, she won't see us.

231
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Please little, Mai. Come in. She's almost here. We can watch it from inside.

232
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's no good. I want to see her properly.

233
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
No, little mine. Don't go.

234
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Come back. Little Mai!

235
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh dear! Come on, let's get back in the cabin before it's too late!

236
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Weeee!

237
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Mama, Mama, Mama!

238
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Mama, Mama, Mama!

239
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh! The lady of the cold! Oh! I saw her face! I saw her face!

240
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I saw her and she gets in turn with eyes!

241
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Press a little my to get away with it.

242
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I don't know how she does it.

243
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I think her nerves are made of steel.

244
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I hope she's alright.

245
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:28,000
She should try not to make so much noise out there. Oh Oh!

246
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh!

247
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh!

248
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah! I'm Narve. I'm not ready.

249
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Oh!

250
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Come on, Markwink!

251
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh, now just stop now!

252
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Wait a minute!

253
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,200
This is it! Oh Come on, Markman!

254
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Oh, now just stand there and throw it all in the air!

255
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
This is it!

256
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Little boy!

257
00:20:23,000 --> 00:21:01,500
Oh Oh Huh?

258
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Legal mine! Little Mai! Little Mai!

259
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Come on, please!

260
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Wake up, please!

261
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Oh, please, don't stay frozen, little Mai!

262
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Don't worry, little Mai. We'll thought you out. Don't worry. It's nice and warm here.

263
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Ow! That's hot, movement!

264
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Praise the Bulbob! You come back!

265
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,480
So Little My came back from the cold, little the worst for wear.

266
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:27,000
Mumin need not have worried, for the little miser's world are practically indestructible. Constructible They're always happy and always at play The movements are having fun day after day

267
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The movements

268
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The movements

269
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
They love the laughter and they love the living

270
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The movements

271
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,000
We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

272
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
They're always happy and go as it played

273
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The movements are having fun day after day, the moment.
