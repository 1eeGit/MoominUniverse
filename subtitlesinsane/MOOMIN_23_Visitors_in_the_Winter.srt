1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're here for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I think it's a good idea.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:47,000
sing the best song ever, there were the movements, there was the movement

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There was the movement, there was the movement

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There was the movement, there was the movement La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la During the long winter in Mumen Valley, almost everybody living there, hybronates until the sunshine comes again in the spring.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,680
But for some reason, Mumen and Little Mai woke up

15
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,400
in the middle of it and couldn't get back to sleep.

16
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,359
Ah, this is great.

17
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,680
I'm really starving, I hope there's lots.

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,439
Oh, this plenty left.

19
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,200
Mama thought she'd made too much this year,

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,799
but it's lucky for us she did.

21
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,759
I don't know what we'd have had to eat otherwise.

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Shh.

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,479
They're still sleeping.

24
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:31,199
Well, at least you got me to play with Moonman.

25
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,560
Whoa!

26
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,159
Wow!

27
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,759
Wow!

28
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,560
That was fun! What are you ever go, Moonman?

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm probably a bit heavy for it. So get something else, dummy!

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I might later. Anyway, I thought we were gonna see Tuteki.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Come on, I'll pull you.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I know why you don't want to go-moo-man.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're scared of sliding down from the top, aren't you?

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No, of course I'm not.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Do you think he's not here? I wonder where she's gone to.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's her over there, isn't it?

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, yeah, I think it is.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,699
J-Mumin, she looks like she's sliding!

40
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:26,699
Slighting?

41
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:29,699
Yes, it's obvious. She's sliding, of course!

42
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:31,699
She's coming over!

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,699
What were you doing out there, Tiki?

44
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,699
Watching the sun go down.

45
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:40,699
It's the only place you can see it from.

46
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:43,400
I just caught it for it disappeared over the horizon.

47
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,699
Where did it go to?

48
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,639
It comes up again in the south and will probably shine on snuffkin.

49
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,919
Hey, Tiki, what are those things you got on your feet?

50
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,240
They're called skates, and they're the best thing possible

51
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,599
for moving across the ice quickly.

52
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,719
Just what I need.

53
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,680
Come on, show me how to do it.

54
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,520
Yes, okay.

55
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,180
That's great.

56
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,780
I'm gonna make myself some skates too.

57
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,340
It's not as easy as you think, little lie.

58
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,500
Pathetic.

59
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,419
Ianid is a sword and knife on your shoes

60
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,280
and that sounds easy enough to me.

61
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,180
You know, it's strange,

62
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,180
but I've got a funny kind of feeling

63
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,079
that there's someone else apart from us in the bathhouse.

64
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,839
Hmm, well there is.

65
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,839
Who is it?

66
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,839
Where are they?

67
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,920
Little Maya can't see them.

68
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Huh, what do you mean I can't see them?

69
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,439
Where are they hiding in the cupboard?

70
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,480
No, they're invisible.

71
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,480
Look, I'll show you.

72
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh, oh, there's something on my head! See, that's two of the schoomis. There are eight of them all together.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Now, don't walk on the line.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I didn't see any schoomis here in the summer.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Although, if they're invisible, I wouldn't have done.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, probably not.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
As in the summer when we come across new little animals

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
that we've never seen before,

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
we'll be able to see the little ones.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,240
I don't know if they're invisible invisible, I wouldn't have done. No, probably not.

81
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,839
As in the summer when we come across new little animals that we've never seen before,

82
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:15,040
and who likes snuffkin, go away when the wind and snow comes.

83
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,879
Then when the days are shorter, and everyone else is hibernating, they come out,

84
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,839
and summer so shy they're invisible and dear.

85
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:25,639
I'm afraid I don't understand winter at all.

86
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,040
Well, of course you don't.

87
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,720
You moments have always slept through

88
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,279
and don't know very much about it.

89
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,079
Oh, I can't wait to tell Mum or Puppa about all this.

90
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,480
They'll be really amazed.

91
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,720
Moomin!

92
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,120
What is it?

93
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,000
We will wake up tomorrow, won't we, Moomin?

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sure we will. Why?

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I just don't want to go on sleeping and sleeping until spring.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, we woke up today, so...

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But we don't know about tomorrow!

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No, of course not. We'll have to wait and see.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If we're awake, we'll know, and if we're asleep, then it doesn't matter.

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Hmm.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, if I'm not awake, can you are, wake me up, okay, Moomin?

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes, alright. Go to sleep now.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What if it's the other way around, Moomin?

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, what if I wake up and you're still fast asleep?

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't mind sleeping all winter. Now stop talking to me, my.

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You'd better wake me up or else. Hey little mine. Huh?

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Hey, little my! Where have you gone to?

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Huh?

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh!

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Hello!

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Well, well, wonderful place for skiing you've got here.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What are those funny things on your feet?

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hey, what? You're joking.

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Huh?

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You mean you really don't know what these are?

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's why I'm asking you!

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, they're skis, didn't you see me come down?

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes, I did. Can you slide on the ice with these and go just as fast?

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,500
Oh no, on ice you have to use skates.

120
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
What is that young lady?

121
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Oh, it's a snowboard. You slide on the snow with it.

122
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,000
That's not bad, but it's only a silver tray, isn't it?

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's right, mister.

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll teach you to ski.

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No, thank you.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll learn by watching you.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Won't take me long at all.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm afraid skiing is not that easy, young lady.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't worry.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It won't be for me.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Everything is once I decide to do it. Oh, so you spend all year going where the snow is? That must be tiring. Not at all. Life should be a struggle.

132
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,040
This jam is really good. Does it always have to be winter, catch a struggle in spring and summer instead?

133
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:26,500
Well, no, that would be too easy. You could just sit back and relax. No, you've got to face up to the cold and exercise to keep warm.

134
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,000
That sounds very interesting, Mr. Brisk.

135
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,500
One clear cold bath a day keeps all those unnecessary thoughts away.

136
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,000
My own little poem.

137
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
What? You don't mean you swim in this weather, do you?

138
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,000
The water must be very close to freezing.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
Well, the sea is a lot colder than that.

140
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,559
It is frozen.

141
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,840
Is there a river?

142
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,240
Yes, there is, but the water looks very, very cold.

143
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,559
Sounds just right.

144
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,879
Have you got any more of this wonderful jam?

145
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,679
It's delicious.

146
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,679
There's some more in the cellar, but we've got cranberry up here

147
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,039
if you'd like that.

148
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,320
No, thanks. This will do for now here if you'd like that. No thanks.

149
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,919
This will do for now.

150
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,419
I'd appreciate some after my daily swim.

151
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,419
It'll work up an appetite.

152
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:12,419
Oh!

153
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,419
Yeah!

154
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,419
Oh!

155
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:15,419
This is great!

156
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:16,419
It's great!

157
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:17,419
It's great!

158
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:19,419
It can hardly watch.

159
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:21,419
It makes me shiver all over.

160
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:22,419
Is everybody like you?

161
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:23,419
Where you come from?

162
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:24,419
I'm, of course, Mblynat.

163
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:27,000
Why did you come from?

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm cross-moving that. Why did you join me?

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No, thank you.

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Hello? What are you two looking at?

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:48,279
Oh, hello, there, little dog. We're watching that madman down there

168
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,399
he looks like he's swimming moving valley is full of very odd people he's not from moving valley is a matter of fact how are you I'm sorry you and I'm looking

169
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:05,000
for my brothers I don't suppose you've seen them, have you? Your brothers, have you lost them?

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Are they hibernating somewhere, do you think?

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,500
Oh no, not them. They never do that.

172
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, everyone else in Moomabali is hibernating,

173
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
except little Mai here, now two tiki and the invisible mice,

174
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
me, oh, and that crazy person down in the river.

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Whoa!

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, yeah!

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Ah! Oh, ah! I'm a person down in the middle. Whoa! Yeah!

178
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
My brothers are up in the Lonely Mountains. Is that far from here?

179
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No, not far.

180
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Lonely Mountains!

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I know there are wolves up there,

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
but I never heard of any dogs.

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,399
Well wolves and dogs are brothers, didn't you know?

184
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,700
Oh, you know, this tastes even better after an invigorating swim. That's my favorite jam, much nicer than cranberry.

185
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, I agree.

186
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,200
Ah, doggie, now don't you want your jam?

187
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
What?

188
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,399
No, you have it.

189
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,240
Ah, thank you.

190
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,200
Now, you look as though you're a bit worried about something.

191
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,879
Yes, I suppose I am.

192
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,200
Worried fat?

193
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,679
Put it out of your mind.

194
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,279
Why do you think your brothers are wolves?

195
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,279
Did someone tell you they were?

196
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,240
Of course they are.

197
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,759
Everyone knows that.

198
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,840
And besides, I can feel the wolf in me.

199
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,639
Well, you might feel it, but nobody can see it for a star.

200
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,240
Wolves are much bigger than you.

201
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,200
I want to go and find them and then we can all hell at the moon.

202
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,639
I've been practicing.

203
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,080
I can see why he wants to be a wolf but we'd better keep him here.

204
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,480
He could get her if he goes up there on his own.

205
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,080
You don't really want to live with wolves do you?

206
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,759
Oh I do very much.

207
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,340
Why don't you travel around with me, sorry you?

208
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,500
I've got little dogs.

209
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,940
They could be your brothers and sisters if you want.

210
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,139
Well, I don't know.

211
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:53,879
Look, I'm going to stay here in Moomin Valley for a while,

212
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,039
and we can become great friends.

213
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,419
You're going to stay here?

214
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:58,220
Oh, yes.

215
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,620
Marvelous slopes find swimming the most wonderful jam,

216
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,059
and I'll build myself an igloo.

217
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:03,940
An igloo?

218
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,360
You mean a house made of snow?

219
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,879
Yes, that's it exactly.

220
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,000
If it's alright with you,

221
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll take this jam with me just to keep me going. Hello there. Can I borrow your spade for a minute, Mr. Brisk?

222
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Of course. What for, my friend?

223
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I want to break up this barrel.

224
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, that's easy. Allow me, little mind.

225
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. How's that, young lady?

226
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, that's easy.

227
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Allow me, little mind.

228
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

229
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
How's that that young lady?

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Mr. Brisk really loves this gem. He can't stop eating it.

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Well, it's very nice, Moomin. I can't imagine anyone not liking it.

232
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Do you know how to ski to a tiki?

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Well, of course I do. I just haven't done it yet.

234
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Mr. Brisk says that he's gonna teach me.

235
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh.

236
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I can't move my legs tied up like this.

237
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's the whole point. You don't have to. You just move your skis. Easy as winking.

238
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No! No! No!

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
First of all, you have to learn how to fall properly.

240
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But if I learn to ski first, then I wouldn't fall.

241
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Wee!

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Ah!

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Little my Husky too.

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Well, they're just made from an old barrel.

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You're so much more sophisticated.

246
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,399
Now, and then, Genese, and Lean Forward, are you ready?

247
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,799
I don't think I like this. It's too steep.

248
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,960
Can I practice on something a bit flatter?

249
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,240
Well, maybe next time. Now then, off you go!

250
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Trying to start an avalanche, moving? You know, I think this hill is even steeper than the last one.

251
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Nothing to worry about.

252
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
You've already mastered falling down, huh?

253
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
You go again.

254
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Oh!

255
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Oh!

256
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Oh!

257
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Oh!

258
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Oh!

259
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Oh!

260
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Oh!

261
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

262
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh!

263
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, stop it, please!

264
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You can do it yourself, just calm down.

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh!

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh!

267
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Oh, look at that!

268
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Marbles, you need!

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Please, someone stop me, please!

270
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Oh! Oh!

271
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That was terrific moment. Let's do it again!

272
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh!

273
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What are you looking at, sorry you?

274
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I can hear all my brothers howling out there.

275
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
They're probably hungry and looking for food.

276
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
No, I know they're calling me.

277
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm going to see them. I've really got to a moment.

278
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What a... Oh. Got anything? No, not yet. I'm afraid there's going to be trouble. We're running out of jam.

279
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Mr. Bresch is opposed.

280
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You can't stop eating it.

281
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Well, you have to ask him to leave.

282
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I can't do that.

283
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, of course you can.

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's your home and you can choose who you have.

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh. I can't do that. Well, of course you can. It's your home and you can choose who you have.

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
A snowstorm is sweeping through the valley.

287
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Usually a sign that spring is not far away. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go.

288
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm going to have to go.

289
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm going to have to go.

290
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm going to have to go.

291
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm going to have to go.

292
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm going to have to go.

293
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm going to have to go.

294
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm going to have to go.

295
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm going to have to go.

296
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm going to have to go.

297
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. Hello, Moomin!

298
00:16:47,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh, hello, Mr. Brisk. Look, I'm sorry, but all the jams gone. And just an empty jar.

299
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Oh, well, never mind. It was a great jam.

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,440
But I have more important things on my mind.

301
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,000
You see, now that spring is here,

302
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,720
I have to leave, Moomin Valley.

303
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,200
Oh, do you?

304
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,960
It's sad, but there you are.

305
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,400
I have to go.

306
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,559
Goodbye, Moomin.

307
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:23,640
Goodbye, then, Mr. Bursk.

308
00:17:23,640 --> 00:18:02,039
Keep some jam for me. Hello, I'm sorry, I'm your brother, I've wanted to be with you for a long, long time.

309
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,279
I'm afraid I'm not very brave or strong, but if you'd let me stay with you.

310
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,599
Oh, don't you know me?

311
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,160
Looks like I was wrong.

312
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,880
Oh, well, go on.

313
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,240
Eat me if you want to.

314
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:27,000
It's a pity I didn't sleep at night instead of learning to howl.

315
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Mum and I was right, I shouldn't have come. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go.

316
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm going to have to go.

317
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm going to have to go.

318
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm going to have to go.

319
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm going to have to go.

320
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm going to have to go.

321
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm going to have to go.

322
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm going to have to go.

323
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm going to have to go.

324
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm going to have to go.

325
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:16,180
I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. Oh hello little doggy, what are you doing here?

326
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,880
Have you been waiting for me?

327
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,000
We'll have a great time traveling around the world together. Ah!

328
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Hooray!

329
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Hooray!

330
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
See?

331
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Hooray!

332
