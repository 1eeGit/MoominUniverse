Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come. Come on and sit down here with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird, there was a moment

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
There was a moment, there was a moment

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
There was a moment Oh, my God.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Mom.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Everything's so boring. Let's go something, then.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Like what, your instance. I think we've done everything one could possibly do.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
None of you three can think of a single thing to do. You're useless, aren't you?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.900
Well, can you think of anything

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.900
except catching grasshoppers?

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.700
Hmm, there must be something we can do.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.500
Now, we've all had times like this, haven't we?

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.500
Fortunately, right then, the mailman arrived.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.500
Hello, a letter for you.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.700
Oh, a letter! That must be from my sister for me!

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.000
Oh, no, it's from Oomoppa this time.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
That's so. Who would write to him?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
A woman? Someone called Jane?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What? See that he gets it now.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Who could this Jane possibly be?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's your father's old girlfriend, of course.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Never. Oh, I'm sure he had dozens and dozens.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.760
Oomoppa was very kind and handsome young man.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.400
A voice from the past.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.680
Moomin' Papa, liquid, I've got for you.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.039
Moomin' Papa.

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.560
Oh, no.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.400
I was right.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.240
Yes, you were.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.759
Moomin' Mama, I think you should go back to the kitchen.

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.000
Whatever for a little bit. Because Moomin' Papa's stormy youth is catching up with him.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Please, Papa, tell us it's not that kind of letter.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Oh, what do you have?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Oh, what a hurry.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Whatever it was, it was a long time ago, long before I ever met you.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
No, it's not that kind of letter.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.599
What sort of letter is it then? Oh, much worse it's from Aunt Jane. Who's that?

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:58.879
Mine, my dear, is on my father's side. Oh, how boring. You look very pale suddenly, dear.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.400
Yes, because she's coming for a visit tomorrow. Oh, don't worry. There's plenty of time

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.599
for arranging a welcome party.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.599
But I don't like her, and I don't want it to come for a visit.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.199
Lumen, Papa, why not?

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.000
Well, you'll soon see. She's very rich.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.599
Very rich?

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.400
Yes, and she bosses everyone.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.400
We won't have a moment of peace.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.199
Oh, maybe she's so rich.

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:25.680
She'll give us all wonderful presents.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.639
Goodness, this is so unexpected. Why is she coming here all of a sudden?

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:36.879
Oh, she says she wants to discuss money matters. Good heavens with me. She says there's no one else.

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.199
So you see, I'm in a very difficult situation. Oh, why can't you tell if you're not an expert.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.000
You don't tell Aunt Jane things.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
She tells you when that's that.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Is that what explained?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
When you meet her, you'll know exactly what I mean.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
What do I know about money matters?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Nothing.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Not surprising since we've never had any.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
How can she expect a poor creature like you to know anything about money?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Also, she's very, very suspicious.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And she says money is a terrible burden.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Oh, I wouldn't mind children her burden.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Maybe you'll inherit it,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and then we could share the money

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and have a wonderful time together.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Eh?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Help! This time I almost did it. We love it brother, we love it!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So moving Papa has a rich aunt. Very interesting. Yes, she's got so much money she doesn't know what to do with it all.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Oh!

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So snorke, why don't you ask her to invest in your flying ship?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.560
You'll need money to rebuild, won't you? It would be a great investment for her.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.839
It certainly would be. I'm sure she jump at it.

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:39.800
Hmm. There'd be no harm in asking, I guess. What's the matter, Mr. Hemiellen? You look so unhappy.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.879
I'm stuck, that's my problem.

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:43.639
How's that?

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.480
Stuck in my research.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.560
This magnifying glass is very good, of course.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.240
But I just can't get any further

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.480
with my botanical research with this old-fashioned equipment.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.120
What I really need is a microscope and a laboratory.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.639
And they're expensive, I guess.

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.680
Yes, they are, and I don't have any money.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.000
Well, moment Papa's aunt is coming over tomorrow,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and I know she's got any amount of money.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Any amount, now?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I'll get her to finance you, Hamilton,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and we'll get a big greenhouse,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and you'll grow orchids and roses and other things,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and then we'll sell them, oh, oh, I'll get rich.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:47.000
You too! Rich, are you two? Hey, you over there. Hmm? Are you talking to me? Of course I am. Who else?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I said you know the way to move in a house young man.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Yes, she might say I do.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Show me where it is then.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Over there, it's tall and blue.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Just follow that stream and you can't miss it.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.959
Good. Would you be kind enough to take my suit? I'm not sure. I do. Show me where it is, then. Over there, it's tall and blue. Just follow that stream, and you can't miss it.

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:08.459
Good.

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:11.079
Would you be kind enough to take my suitcase?

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:12.160
I'm sorry, I can't.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.399
I'm too busy.

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:15.399
I'll reward you handsomely for your efforts.

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:17.160
Think again, young man.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.199
But all I want to do is fish.

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:19.920
What?

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.439
You don't want money?

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:25.000
I heard you were coming to visit more than probably. You're in Jane, aren't you? You don't want money?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I heard you were coming to visit Moment Papa here in Jane, aren't you? Ooh, ow.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Please, to meet you, I'm here to take you to Moment House.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Is this your suitcase?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Wow!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
This suitcase is very heavy!

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Should be. It's full of golden coins. Huh?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I'll take care of this.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Let's go, eh?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Kate!

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I can't stay in this house.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I don't think I can take Aunt Jane.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I'm going to hide out in the cave until she's gone.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I'm going to hide out in the cave.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.600
I'm going to hide out in the cave. I'm going to hide out in the cave. I'm going to hide out take Aunt Jane. I'm going to hide out in the cave until she's gone.

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:14.240
Bye, bye, Linda here.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.319
Careful, now Aunt Jane.

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:18.839
The banks have been slippery here and there.

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:45.000
Uh, uh, what? Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! She's very small for a daughter. Oh, little Mai isn't ours. She just lives here.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And I won't get any bigger, either.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Hmm.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
She's like a member of the family.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And where's my worthless nephew? Why isn't he here?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Oh, well, he's not at home.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Well, no. When will he be back?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I don't know.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.139
He's away looking for inspiration for his work. So he won't home? Well, no. When will he be back?

00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:06.100
I don't know.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.620
He's away looking for inspiration for his work,

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.259
so he won't be back for a while.

00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:11.899
Since when has he worked?

00:09:11.899 --> 00:09:13.379
I'm here to see him.

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:15.419
Maybe you can see me instead.

00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:17.019
What a splendid idea.

00:09:17.019 --> 00:09:18.860
How clever of you, Mument.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.740
Ridiculous.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.179
He knows nothing about money.

00:09:21.179 --> 00:09:24.019
In that case, it is high time he learned.

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:25.919
As for his father, I may still

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:33.200
disinherit him. I'm a member of his family too. I could talk to you about money matters. Really?

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:46.000
Oh, sniff is a great friend of mine. But hardly a member of the family. Hello, Moon. And you must be on Jane.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I brought my brother to snorke with me.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
He wanted to meet you.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
This is a Jane Be nice to her.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Welcome to Moon in Valley and Jane.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
This is my lovely sister, Snorke Maiden,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
who is Moon in special friend.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.500
The Snorkes and the Moon movements may one day be related,

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.500
so in a way we're all really family.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.500
You, baby, but not to me.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.000
I'm an inventor, and due to an accident,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.500
I'm looking around for a sponsor.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.000
A golden opportunity for anyone with some loose capital.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.500
Welcome to Woman Valley and Chain.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.399
I'm Hemmielin, a botanist of note.

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:30.399
I heard that you might be willing to fund my scientific research and Chain.

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:34.000
A bold and opportunity for anyone with some spare money.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.500
Eh?

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.500
You'd like me to fund your research?

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.500
It was my idea.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.500
If we built a greenhouse and grow rare orchids and roses, we can make a lot of money.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.080
You'll make a lot of money. Young man, can make a lot of money. And you'll make a lot of money.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.679
Young man, I have a lot of money already.

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:50.320
Oh, hasn't Sniff discussed this with you, ma'am?

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.320
Sniff.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.679
Well, I was just getting around to it, Hamulun.

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:54.720
Confusing.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.519
When I am famous for my botanical research, Angie, I...

00:10:58.519 --> 00:10:59.320
I doubt it.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.320
That will ever happen.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.360
This is very confusing indeed for me.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.000
Now, you're Snorkmaid and a friend of Movin' is that right?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Oh, no, I'm the snorkemaid's brother.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
I'm a friend of Movin' Ad-Jane.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Did you really explain about my important research, Sniff?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Did you really explain that I'm a member of the family?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Hey, she got it!

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:36.000
So, and, Jane, it would be great if you were a member to make your way to Movin' Ad-Jane! We need your help! We need your help!

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Here's your rule, Vaget.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I do hope you'll be comfortable here. Just call if you need anything. Come out.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Here's your suitcase. It was very heavy.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Thank you.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Him. What is it? You want a reward? Very heavy. Thank you. And him.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
What is it?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
You want a reward?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
No, no, Aunt Jane.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I mean, yes, I do, but...

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Which is it? Will you make up your mind, young man?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I know where a moment Papa is right now.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
He's a whale on a trip, I know.

00:12:26.919 --> 00:12:28.559
No, no. He's somewhere quite near. Quite near, here.

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:30.159
Well, where is he?

00:12:30.159 --> 00:12:32.879
Moment Papa said not to tell you where he's hiding.

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:33.919
It's a secret.

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:34.919
A secret?

00:12:34.919 --> 00:12:35.879
Yes.

00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:38.799
I suppose I can tell you, but he'll be very angry.

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:39.639
Where is he?

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:40.679
Tell me now.

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:47.000
Oh, well, if I tell you I'm taking a big risk. Hmm. Oh, very well. How much do you want?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I'll leave that to you. I'm not sure if I can get it. I'm not sure if I can get it. I'm not sure if I can get it.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I'm not sure if I can get it. I'm not sure if I can get it. Oh, is that all? Until I've seen him for myself with my own eyes, yes!

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Huh?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
What?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Oh, there's nobody here.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Where is my worthless nephew?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
This is very strange.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
You tricked me, haven't you?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Well, no, I swear I would never do that.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
You certainly deserve no reward.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
But no, wait!

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
If we just look around, we'll find him.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
He's in here somewhere I know it!

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Hey, moment Papa, what is it? Tell me where my nephew is hiding.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Well, as I said before, I want to know the truth.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Dear, he's...

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Now let me see...

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Come on, hurry up.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
He's hiding in the cave down by the beach.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I've just been there, Mom and Mama, and I can't find him.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Then he really must have gone away on a trip.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.399
I'm not going to I can't find him.

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:29.799
Then he really must have gone away on a trip.

00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:32.399
And why should he want to hide from me anyway?

00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:35.600
I think he might be a little bit afraid of you.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.000
Afraid of me?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.799
Afraid of his own aunt?

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:40.600
But why?

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.600
Mostly he's afraid of money matters.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.799
Incredible.

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:47.440
Afraid of me because of money matters?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.480
He must be utterly mad.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.480
What a family.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.639
I don't understand.

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:57.360
It seems that only Smith knows anything about money.

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:02.759
I know where Moomin' Poppy is right now.

00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:05.799
So you want some of my gold, who do you young lady?

00:15:05.799 --> 00:15:08.600
I couldn't care less about your silly gold.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.600
My silly gold indeed.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.200
With silly gold, I assure you you can do just anything you want.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.600
Seems to me, your silly gold doesn't even help you to find Moomin' Poppy.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.600
Hmm?

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.799
I think you should forget about your money.

00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:26.799
Young lady, money isn't something you can just forget about.

00:15:26.799 --> 00:15:28.840
It needs constant looking after.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.440
That's why I must talk to Moom and Papa at once.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.879
Now take me to that rascal nephew of mine.

00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:45.000
If you really know where he is. Do you have me? Of course. Oh, wow, frivolous. Not really.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Oh, well, Frederick and I were frivolous once.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Really?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
If you say so, I suppose I have to believe you.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Huh?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Huh? Really? If you say so, I suppose I have to believe you.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Huh?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Look!

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
What?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Little May and Anne Jane walking together.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
What are they doing?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Little May is plotting something.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Really?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.899
No, man!

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:35.399
Sniff's all right, really. But sometimes he just can't withstand the lure of gold.

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:37.399
Check me!

00:16:37.399 --> 00:16:39.399
No!

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:40.899
Wait, it can't be right!

00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:42.200
Let's go back then.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200
Hmm, hmm.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.460
Fine, just take your time. Hi, guys! Little mind! You can't be right. Let's go back then. Mm-hmm. Fine.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.799
Just take your time.

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.100
Hi, guys.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.039
Little Mai.

00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:51.080
What's the matter?

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.279
We have a guest.

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:53.039
A guest.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.080
Movement, papa.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.399
What?

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:00.039
Movement, papa.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
So this is where you've been hiding. Oh, you just wait.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Oh, you shoot.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
I'm a single man.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Wait a minute.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
No, you wait first.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Wait, please.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Moomin Papa was sort of on his way back from a trip and then stopped by to play chess with me. Oh! Wait, please.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Mumin' Papa was sort of on his way back from a trip

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
and then stopped by to play chess with me.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Yes, exactly.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
No, yes.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Mumin' Mama told her the truth.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Oh, I sort of stopped by.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Why are you so afraid of me, young man?

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Well, I'm not really.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I mean, it's not you.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.740
It's your money. I'm afraid of it. Really scared. Scared of my money? Well, I'm not, not really. I mean, it's not you. It's your money. I'm afraid of it really scares me.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.240
Scared of my money?

00:17:47.579 --> 00:17:48.579
Well, I'm...

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.220
It's perfectly good money at all in gold coins.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.779
Listen, nephew, I'm depending on you as my only relative.

00:17:56.779 --> 00:17:59.119
Yes, yes, please depend.

00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:04.059
When I get too old to do it, you must look after my gold for me. I'm relying on you.

00:18:04.059 --> 00:18:08.000
No, that's not possible. I know, Anne Jane. We can give it all away.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Must be those who'd love to have it. Must be those who need it more than we do.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Oh, a green pearl!

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Grrrr!

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
She's crazy. Don't worry, we'll think of something.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Oh, you would throw my money away without a cut.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Why didn't mean to hurt you, Aunt Jane?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
I know, let's put it all in the bank.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Money likes being in a bank.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
My money would hate being in a back of a terrible idea.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Oh no.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
I'm not going to be a good man.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.440
I'm not going to of a terrible idea. Oh, no banks are so nice nowadays

00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.119
They are of course they have flowers and shiny piggy banks and pretty paintings on the wall

00:19:01.359 --> 00:19:03.359
Is that really true?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Right come on everybody.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Let's hurry home and fix a welcoming party for At Jane.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
A party!

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Yes, any reason is good enough.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
This was Grandma's best cake recipe. Welcome at Jane. Let's drink a toast to the only millionaire in our small circle.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Nayshy live a long and healthy life. Cheers! Cheers!

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Cheers!

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Cheers!

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Now, this is your welcoming party at Jane. What's the matter?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Never in my life of I and my money felt ourselves as welcome before.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
I'm so happy I could cry.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Oh, and once you start crying, you just want to go on.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Not again.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Please don't be unhappy, Jane.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Don't cry.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Dear, oh dear, moment papa.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Moment papa.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Yes, Aunt Jane, what is it?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
I'll put some of my gold in a bag,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
but you must look after the rest when I'm too old.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Oh, hmm.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And why not?

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
All right.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.119
We'll keep it in the cellar and make a nice little niche

00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:28.279
for it with seashells and moss.

00:20:28.279 --> 00:20:30.759
And I'll have someone go down and look at it every week.

00:20:30.759 --> 00:20:32.000
Don't you worry, Anjane.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.839
Your money will be in safe hands.

00:20:33.839 --> 00:20:35.920
Not quite, but I had in mind.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.119
I know.

00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:40.079
But I suppose it can't be helped.

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:44.319
It sounds rather nice, a cozy little niche down in the cellar.

00:20:44.319 --> 00:20:48.960
And if you take a look every week, but oh dear, it will miss me.

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:51.279
Oh, and shame.

00:20:51.279 --> 00:20:54.000
Very well. I have made up my mind.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.880
I'm leaving this sickest with you now.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.759
So you and my goal can get certain used to each other.

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.119
Do what you want with it.

00:21:01.119 --> 00:21:04.000
Your friends seem to have ideas about how to spend it,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.039
flying ships and botanical research

00:21:06.039 --> 00:21:07.359
sound rather splendid.

00:21:07.359 --> 00:21:08.359
Oh, boy!

00:21:08.359 --> 00:21:09.359
Wonderful!

00:21:09.359 --> 00:21:13.359
I'm so happy for you.
