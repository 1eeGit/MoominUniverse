291920,293720,"so you could make her visible again.",287000,293800,"SPEAKER_10"

302320,304240,"Because she'd talk at all to Tiki.",302200,306800,"SPEAKER_10"
304240,305240,"I'm afraid not.",302200,306800,"SPEAKER_10"

307240,308240,"Oh, dear.",307200,308000,"SPEAKER_10"
308240,313160,"I'm sure I can think of lots of games, but it'll be hard to play if I can't see her.",308000,308100,"SPEAKER_03"
313160,315680,"She'll be really good at hiding seat, though.",308500,314000,"SPEAKER_03"
315680,317160,"Oh, it's okay.",315300,315300,"SPEAKER_03"

523320,526320,"in your granny's book of household remedies.",521100,526600,"SPEAKER_07"
526320,528320,"I don't know if there's a cure for invisibility.",521100,526600,"SPEAKER_07"

555320,557320,"Ah, this must be it.",548300,553800,"SPEAKER_04"
558320,563320,"The prescription was at the end of the book,",555700,557000,"SPEAKER_04"
563320,567320,"and shakily written, but it looked like the right one.",555700,557000,"SPEAKER_04"
567320,571320,"It said, remedy for when people start getting misty",555700,557000,"SPEAKER_04"
571320,573320,"and difficult to see.",570800,572700,"SPEAKER_01"
573320,575320,"It was very complicated.",573000,574100,"SPEAKER_01"

608320,610320,"Yes, you're right.",607300,608900,"SPEAKER_07"

689320,691320,"Ha, they look silly.",686600,689200,"SPEAKER_03"
691320,693320,"I think they're very nice feet.",689800,691300,"SPEAKER_12"
693320,695320,"I know who and Mama's remedies are good,",691600,693100,"SPEAKER_02"
695320,697320,"but I can't see them working that fast.",693700,701200,"SPEAKER_12"
697320,701320,"Anyway, you must look pretty bad if you want to make yourself invisible.",693700,701200,"SPEAKER_12"
701320,703320,"Don't let little my upset you, Ninny.",701200,707100,"SPEAKER_03"

708320,710320,"I'm bored, Moomin.",707100,710500,"SPEAKER_12"
710320,712320,"Well, what shall we do then, Moomin?",707100,710500,"SPEAKER_12"
712320,714320,"I don't know.",710800,712300,"SPEAKER_03"
714320,715320,"Let's go mushroom picking.",712700,713700,"SPEAKER_03"
715320,717320,"That's boring, I never find any.",714600,716300,"SPEAKER_03"
717320,719320,"Well, I do.",716300,718000,"SPEAKER_02"
719320,722320,"Would you like to come, Ninny?",718400,719200,"SPEAKER_03"
722320,725320,"Good, and we can see who can pick the most, shall we?",720200,721500,"SPEAKER_03"
725320,727320,"They all look the same to me,",723000,725700,"SPEAKER_02"
727320,730320,"so you'll have to tell me which ones are safe to eat.",726200,730300,"SPEAKER_02"
732320,734320,"I'll tell you.",726200,730300,"SPEAKER_02"
747320,749320,"Papa! Papa!",734100,734700,"SPEAKER_12"
749320,752320,"Look, Papa, you can see Ninny's shoes now.",748000,749400,"SPEAKER_03"
752320,754320,"Oh, that's good.",750200,752900,"SPEAKER_03"
754320,756320,"There's not many things Mama's potions won't cure.",753400,757000,"SPEAKER_07"
756320,757320,"Oh, it can't be that.",753400,757000,"SPEAKER_07"
757320,759320,"She only took it a minute ago.",757000,759900,"SPEAKER_03"
760320,763320,"Well, it might be that it works faster if you're completely invisible.",760200,763500,"SPEAKER_07"
763320,766320,"I think it's being away from that horrid out.",760200,763500,"SPEAKER_07"
766320,768320,"Yes, it could be.",766200,767400,"SPEAKER_07"
768320,771320,"Mama, we're taking Ninny mushroom picking.",768100,768800,"SPEAKER_03"
771320,773320,"Have a nice time.",769000,771100,"SPEAKER_03"
773320,775320,"Morning!",771600,772800,"SPEAKER_03"
775320,777320,"Morning!",775100,776300,"SPEAKER_07"
777320,779320,"Hello.",776800,777600,"SPEAKER_03"
780320,782320,"Where's Ninny?",776800,777600,"SPEAKER_03"
790320,792320,"Oh!",781800,781800,"SPEAKER_12"
802320,804320,"Huh!",792600,793100,"SPEAKER_06"
807320,810320,"Wow, what a lot of mushrooms!",792600,793100,"SPEAKER_06"
814320,817320,"You seem to know where to find all the best ones, Ninny.",808000,809800,"SPEAKER_03"
819320,822320,"It's so fair. I haven't gotten half as many.",815000,817500,"SPEAKER_03"
822320,825320,"How are you doing, Momen?",819900,822700,"SPEAKER_03"
825320,830320,"Wow, that must be about four times as many as I've got.",823400,823400,"SPEAKER_03"
825320,830320,"Wow, that must be about four times as many as I've got.",823400,825100,"SPEAKER_02"
830320,833320,"Uh, yeah, that's right.",828100,833600,"SPEAKER_02"
833320,836320,"You've never picked that many before.",828100,833600,"SPEAKER_02"
836320,840320,"You know, Momen, I think there's something fishy about this.",834000,836100,"SPEAKER_02"
843320,846320,"Uh-huh, so they're not yours at all.",837500,840300,"SPEAKER_02"
846320,849320,"Well, not really, no.",843400,846200,"SPEAKER_02"
850320,852320,"Ninny's enjoyed herself.",846500,846500,"SPEAKER_03"
850320,852320,"Ninny's enjoyed herself.",846500,848400,"SPEAKER_12"
852320,855320,"I bet her yucky old aunt never let her go mushroom picking.",850900,855600,"SPEAKER_12"
855320,859320,"She was probably only allowed to carry the baskets, the really heavy ones.",850900,855600,"SPEAKER_12"
859320,862320,"Oh, how awful for her.",855800,859900,"SPEAKER_02"
866320,868320,"They're stinky.",861000,862300,"SPEAKER_03"
868320,870320,"What's he up to now?",866900,868000,"SPEAKER_03"
870320,872320,"I'll take care of him.",870300,871000,"SPEAKER_12"
872320,874320,"Hello, Momen, long time no see.",871000,871600,"SPEAKER_03"
874320,876320,"Not long enough.",873000,895100,"SPEAKER_03"
876320,879320,"Last time you dipped my swimming shorts in glue.",873000,895100,"SPEAKER_03"
879320,881320,"You know, I thought that was very funny.",873000,895100,"SPEAKER_03"
881320,884320,"Hey, what's that basket floating around up there for?",873000,895100,"SPEAKER_03"
884320,887320,"I don't want to be rude, but mind your own business.",873000,895100,"SPEAKER_03"
887320,889320,"It looks like the Hobgoblins work.",873000,895100,"SPEAKER_03"
889320,892320,"Boy, just think of all the things you could do if you were invisible.",873000,895100,"SPEAKER_03"
892320,894320,"Ninny, I'll carry your basket.",873000,895100,"SPEAKER_03"
894320,895320,"Let's go.",873000,895100,"SPEAKER_03"
895320,898320,"It stinks here.",873000,895100,"SPEAKER_03"
898320,900320,"Hey, you!",896000,897200,"SPEAKER_12"
900320,902320,"Isn't it me a name or just a description?",899100,902800,"SPEAKER_03"
902320,905320,"What's wrong? Is your voice invisible, too?",899100,902800,"SPEAKER_03"
905320,907320,"Please stop it, stinky.",902800,909100,"SPEAKER_03"
907320,909320,"Can't you see you're frightening her?",902800,909100,"SPEAKER_03"
909320,911320,"Oh, it's a girl, is it?",909200,915500,"SPEAKER_03"
911320,913320,"Why doesn't she speak for herself?",909200,915500,"SPEAKER_03"
913320,916320,"She's stupid. What a perfect name for her, Ninny.",909200,915500,"SPEAKER_03"
916320,918320,"Now look, stinky.",909200,915500,"SPEAKER_03"
918320,920320,"Oh, yes, Momen. Now look what?",916800,926000,"SPEAKER_03"
920320,924320,"You stop upsetting Ninny or I'll get really angry.",916800,926000,"SPEAKER_03"
924320,927320,"Without those feet, she'd be perfect for a back robbery.",916800,926000,"SPEAKER_03"
927320,931320,"Well, she's getting visible again, so she'll be no good to you at all, stinky.",926000,927600,"SPEAKER_02"
931320,936320,"You couldn't see any of her yesterday, not even the feet.",927900,934500,"SPEAKER_12"
936320,938320,"They're disappearing again.",935800,936400,"SPEAKER_12"
938320,941320,"You have to do a scare of it.",938000,939800,"SPEAKER_03"
941320,944320,"Oh, see? She's gone.",938000,939800,"SPEAKER_03"
944320,947320,"It's all your fault, stinky.",941700,942000,"SPEAKER_06"
947320,951320,"Yes, and like I told you before, she'd make a brilliant back robbery.",944900,963100,"SPEAKER_03"
951320,954320,"Don't you agree? Perfect.",944900,963100,"SPEAKER_03"
954320,957320,"Ninny would never do such a thing as that.",944900,963100,"SPEAKER_03"
957320,960320,"And anyway, Mama's given her one of Granny's magic remedies.",944900,963100,"SPEAKER_03"
960320,963320,"She'll soon be visible again, so they're there.",944900,963100,"SPEAKER_03"
971320,973320,"Whose basket is this?",944900,963100,"SPEAKER_03"
973320,975320,"Mine in little mice.",971700,973200,"SPEAKER_04"
975320,978320,"Well, there's not many of them, but they certainly are pretty.",973600,978500,"SPEAKER_04"
978320,983320,"There weren't many left for us to get, because Ninny has picked them all.",973600,978500,"SPEAKER_04"
983320,986320,"It doesn't really matter how many you've got because you can't eat them.",978900,982500,"SPEAKER_12"
986320,989320,"Let me show you.",983700,987900,"SPEAKER_04"
989320,991320,"Now, this is deadly, tufted toadstool.",983700,987900,"SPEAKER_04"
991320,993320,"And this is cow's bane.",989700,991900,"SPEAKER_04"
993320,997320,"You must remember what they look like.",992200,995700,"SPEAKER_04"
997320,1000320,"Ah, these are movements and sniff, I should think.",992200,995700,"SPEAKER_04"
1000320,1002320,"We didn't pick any poisoners once.",997400,1000400,"SPEAKER_04"
1002320,1007320,"Not quite as many as snorkemaiden and little mice, but this is body fly bane",1000500,1012700,"SPEAKER_04"
1007320,1009320,"and insiduous pepper spunk.",1000500,1012700,"SPEAKER_04"
1009320,1011320,"And you've both got cow's bane, too.",1000500,1012700,"SPEAKER_04"
1011320,1013320,"You must be more careful.",1000500,1012700,"SPEAKER_04"
1013320,1014320,"Now, this is better.",1013300,1025400,"SPEAKER_04"
1014320,1017320,"There's not one mushroom in here that you can't eat.",1013300,1025400,"SPEAKER_04"
1017320,1020320,"How did Ninny manage to do this all on her own?",1013300,1025400,"SPEAKER_04"
1020320,1022320,"What a very clever girl she is.",1013300,1025400,"SPEAKER_04"
1022320,1024320,"Ninny, where are you?",1013300,1025400,"SPEAKER_04"
1024320,1026320,"Come here a minute.",1013300,1025400,"SPEAKER_04"
1026320,1027320,"Ninny, didn't you hear?",1026100,1028800,"SPEAKER_12"
1027320,1029320,"Mama wants you.",1026100,1028800,"SPEAKER_12"
1032320,1035320,"Ninny, this is a beautiful mushroom basket.",1026100,1028800,"SPEAKER_12"
1035320,1037320,"We'll have a feast tonight.",1032700,1036600,"SPEAKER_04"
1039320,1041320,"Her feet have come back.",1032700,1036600,"SPEAKER_04"
1042320,1044320,"Oh, I'm so glad.",1040600,1040700,"SPEAKER_12"
1044320,1046320,"We'll soon be able to see your face.",1043000,1051700,"SPEAKER_04"
1046320,1048320,"It won't take long at all, Ninny.",1043000,1051700,"SPEAKER_04"
1048320,1050320,"And you mustn't worry about stinky one little bit.",1043000,1051700,"SPEAKER_04"
1050320,1052320,"He's all talk.",1043000,1051700,"SPEAKER_04"
1052320,1055320,"If something upsets you, just think of something else.",1043000,1051700,"SPEAKER_04"
1055320,1058320,"At least that's my philosophy in life.",1053000,1058200,"SPEAKER_02"
1058320,1061320,"If somebody upsets you, ignore him.",1058200,1058200,"SPEAKER_04"
1061320,1063320,"That's my philosophy, Ninny.",1059300,1063200,"SPEAKER_12"
1063320,1066320,"Anyone who picks mushrooms like this deserves to be seen.",1059300,1063200,"SPEAKER_12"
1066320,1069320,"You mustn't let anything frighten you when you're with us.",1063500,1066600,"SPEAKER_04"
1069320,1071320,"Do you understand?",1066800,1070600,"SPEAKER_04"
1074320,1077320,"Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.",1073000,1073700,"SPEAKER_12"
1077320,1079320,"That's just great, Ninny.",1075000,1076600,"SPEAKER_12"
1079320,1081320,"Oh, that's wonderful, Ninny.",1077900,1082300,"SPEAKER_03"
1081320,1082320,"Wonderful.",1077900,1082300,"SPEAKER_03"
1082320,1084320,"I can't wait to see all of you.",1082300,1089100,"SPEAKER_04"
1084320,1086320,"It won't be long now.",1082300,1089100,"SPEAKER_04"
1086320,1089320,"But I don't think Mouse Gray is quite your color, you know.",1082300,1089100,"SPEAKER_04"
1100320,1102320,"You just sleep as long as you like, Ninny.",1082300,1089100,"SPEAKER_04"
1102320,1103320,"Good night now.",1082300,1089100,"SPEAKER_04"
1103320,1105320,"If you want anything, you just shout.",1082300,1089100,"SPEAKER_04"
1129320,1132320,"Oh, where's Mom and Mama?",1114900,1115200,"SPEAKER_03"
1159320,1164320,"Well, well, what are you doing?",1149900,1152100,"SPEAKER_07"
1164320,1167320,"I mean, do you know what time it is?",1162100,1166500,"SPEAKER_07"
1167320,1169320,"Do you like this moment, Papa?",1166500,1169000,"SPEAKER_04"
1169320,1170320,"Hmm.",1166500,1169000,"SPEAKER_04"
1170320,1173320,"Yes, it's very nice.",1169400,1170300,"SPEAKER_04"
1173320,1176320,"It's good to have someone in the house to make clothes for it last.",1173300,1176500,"SPEAKER_04"
1176320,1178320,"I hope it'll look pretty on her.",1173300,1176500,"SPEAKER_04"
1178320,1179320,"What's this for?",1176800,1178300,"SPEAKER_04"
1179320,1180320,"Her hair.",1178900,1179900,"SPEAKER_05"
1189320,1191320,"praise.",1179600,1180500,"SPEAKER_04"
1196320,1213320,"ok",1179600,1180500,"SPEAKER_04"

1217320,1218320,"You're very early today.",1217200,1218200,"SPEAKER_07"
1218320,1220320,"You're a burly?",1217200,1218200,"SPEAKER_07"
1220320,1222320,"I can't wait to see her.",1219600,1220400,"SPEAKER_03"
1222320,1223320,"Come on, man.",1220900,1222400,"SPEAKER_12"
1229320,1232320,"It's like waiting for Christmas, isn't it?",1222800,1223400,"SPEAKER_12"
1232320,1235320,"Yeah, I like having presents every day.",1230200,1232200,"SPEAKER_12"
1235320,1237320,"Isn't it, Papa?",1233400,1236800,"SPEAKER_03"
1237320,1240320,"Well, I think it's much more exciting this way.",1233400,1236800,"SPEAKER_03"
1240320,1243320,"We have to wait until she's ready to come down.",1237700,1243100,"SPEAKER_04"
1243320,1246320,"Did you hear that door opening?",1237700,1243100,"SPEAKER_04"
1246320,1248320,"She's awake!",1244700,1246200,"SPEAKER_04"
1250320,1253320,"I hope she found the dress where I left it on the table.",1246800,1247700,"SPEAKER_04"
1253320,1255320,"Oh, good.",1250500,1253100,"SPEAKER_04"
1255320,1257320,"It's all right.",1250500,1253100,"SPEAKER_04"
1257320,1259320,"Now, you know where to look.",1250500,1253100,"SPEAKER_04"
1261320,1263320,"Well, it's time to go to bed.",1250500,1253100,"SPEAKER_04"

1293320,1295320,"Oh.",1290200,1292400,"SPEAKER_11"
1295320,1297320,"Ha! So she can talk!",1294800,1296400,"SPEAKER_11"
1301320,1303320,"They still couldn't see Nini's face.",1301300,1303100,"SPEAKER_01"
