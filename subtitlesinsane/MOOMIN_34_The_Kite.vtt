    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They're for you on your TV.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They are the movements.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So, what do you think?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm not sure.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements, so come with me give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there was the time of year for movement to get restless.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:45.439
Snuff can to leave Mogen Valley on his yearly trek south.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.280
Good morning, Papa. That bonfire looks inviting.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.000
I hear up already.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Mm-hmm.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We're buried in leaves this morning after that wind last night.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Yes, winders on the way.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Oh, this is a lovely bonfire.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Yes, isn't it?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I guess we're hibernating again this winter. Are we moving, Papa?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Hmm, well, of course. We always hibernate in the winter.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.800
If Snuffkin says I could go with him,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.479
couldn't I give this winter a miss

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:32.639
and hibernate longer next year?

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.639
Mawd.

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.719
Oh, please, moving, Papa.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.080
Snuffkin will rather go alone, I think, moving.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.120
But I might get him to change his mind.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.960
But Snuffkin's not really a person

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.520
who likes to be pressed.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.360
Why not?

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.319
Well, he's a very solitary person.

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.039
His winter trip is the only time he can really be alone for a while.

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:56.759
I know, but I was just hoping.

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.840
Snoughkin likes you very much.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.120
I know that.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.080
And I think that's why he stays in Momen Valley

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.120
for the rest of the year.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.000
But at heart, he's a vagabond and he needs time away from us.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
He's not a family man, so he's free to do as he wants.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And as his friend, you should try to understand.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I know you'd like to go with him, but I don't think it is such a good idea.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
He'd really hate to turn you down, I know.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I guess.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
But he'd have to.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Oh.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Oh.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Oh.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Why aren't they biting?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I haven't had a proper catch for days.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Getting too cold is it?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
When are you leaving?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Huh?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
You're about to leave, aren't you?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Yes.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Could I ask you something? What? Don't go without telling me.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
But why?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I'm always sad when you leave, even though I know you'll return in the spring.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Yeah. Me too, sort of.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
That's why this year I'd plan to leave without saying anything.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I'd like to wish you good luck and all that.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I miss you so much when you're away. Please, Nuffkin. But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly. I'd like to wish you good luck and all that.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I miss you so much when you're away.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Please, Snuffkin.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Mumin, I have a better idea.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I won't leave until after you've started hibernating.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Then you won't miss me, will you?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
You're right.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I'll take my great idea, Snuffkin.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Then we won't really part at all, won't we?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Nope.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.680
Because I promised to be back here in Movement Valley before you even woken up.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.519
Wonderful! What a super idea!

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:55.759
Hey, moment!

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.279
Oh, sniff!

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:02.000
Moment, come here a minute! There's something funny caught up in a tree!

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.600
What do you mean, funny?

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.600
I don't know exactly never saw anything like it before.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.800
Snortman and little My found it first, but it's too high to get it down.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.800
Okay, I'll come have a look.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Be careful!

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Careful! What is it, moving?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I know what it is, it's a kite.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Oh what? A kite is something you fly in the sky.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
There's no wings.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:06:07.000
No, you send it up against the wind on a string. Oh, oh a sec!

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Oh, throw it down!

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Yes, all right!

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Oh, song!

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.000
This is what a kite looks like.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Looks broken to me.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I'm sure we can fix it and make it fly.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Let's see.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Oh no, the string must have broken when someone was flying it

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and the wind blew it down into the tree.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Well, why don't we repair it?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Yes, let's.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.600
Looks pretty badly broken to me.

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:48.240
Well I don't know, we'll have to see.

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:56.160
It is a kite isn't it? Hmm. Can we mend it? Maybe.

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:05.000
A very odd kite? It must have come from far away.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
You think it can be repaired?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Of course.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Well, come on, then snork will help you repair it.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I can repair it without your help,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
as long as you can find us some really long string,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
strong but not too thick of possible.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I think I have what you need, some string.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Good, excellent. I'll start immediately. I'm so excited.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Oh, I'm so excited.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Oh, I'm so excited.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Oh, I'm so excited.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Oh, I'm so excited.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Oh, I'm so excited.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Oh, I'm so excited.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Oh, I'm so excited.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.559
Oh, I'm so excited. Oh, I'm so excited. Oh, I'm so excited. This is a really exciting project I haven't flown a kite for years.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.840
I do hope that string is long enough.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.759
Snowark is this okay?

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:39.759
Fine, who's gonna fly it?

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:40.759
I'll do it.

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:42.240
Who cares, sniff?

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.240
Moving?

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.639
Hold the kite up high.

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:45.220
Like this? Hmm. All right, sniff, are you ready? I'll do it! Who cares, Sniff? Moomin, hold the kite up high!

00:08:46.019 --> 00:08:46.779
Like this? Hmm.

00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:48.720
Alright, Sniff, are you ready?

00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:50.740
Yeah, I'm ready.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.500
Don't let go, do I say win?

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.500
Win, moment!

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.500
Ho!

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Uh-oh, it's fallen. Try again and this time start running and when the wind catches the kite you start paying out the light.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Alright fine. Hold it up again, moment.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Right. Ready?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Yeah, I'm ready. Let go of it!

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Easy going up yet!

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
No, it isn't. Stop! Let go of it! Yeezy going up again!

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
No it isn't! Stop, Snap! You're breaking a kite!

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I don't think this kite's any good for anybody!

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The kite's fine! It's just that the wind is too weak!

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
You're right. We'll have to wait for it to get stronger.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Titty though, we certainly had a good strong wind yesterday.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Is it okay?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I think the wind is getting stronger, Moomin. Oh, my God! There it goes!

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
With me, all the strength, little man.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Boy, this wind is really strong! Can I let out the strength now?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Do it slowly, my...

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.200
All right. Boy, this wind is really strong! Can I let out the string now?

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.600
Do it slowly, Mike!

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.600
Alright!

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.200
Let me do it!

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.200
Snip them on!

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.200
It's my turn!

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.600
Let me break your kiln, little boy!

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.600
Why not?

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.600
Because you don't win, I'm taller!

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.600
I'm very strong!

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.600
My gun's quite dry!

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:52.799
You come up with it!

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.200
You're still... Yes, Papa?

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.600
The difficulty could hold it for a while.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.000
Well, yes, you'd like it.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.600
Hold it really tight, then.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
All right, I could do this long before he was born!

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Oops!

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Watch the rain!

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Papa, why did you drop quickly?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And I'm winding, I'm winding!

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:45.279
Faster! Oh, winding Faster, open the faster! With such a strong wind up there, I think we have to lower the centre of gravity a bit.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.480
The kite's all right, Papa!

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.919
Hmm, maybe it would take me with it.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
That's it! I suppose that's to stop it from spinning around, is it snorke? Yes, that's right!

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Hmm...

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
What is it?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Listen, I'm gonna ride that kite!

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
What did you say?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I think it's going to be okay now.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
If I hold on really tight,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I think I could have a wonderful ride on that kite.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Yes, maybe it'd be wonderful while you're up in the sky,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
but you've seen how fast it can come down again.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
But the snork just said it won't fall down again.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Even so!

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I'm gonna do it.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.580
But no one must see me or they might try again. But the snork just said it won't fall down again.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.779
Even so!

00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:48.179
I'm gonna do it.

00:12:48.179 --> 00:12:52.019
But no one must see me or they might try to stop me if they guess what I'm up to.

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:53.480
Oh, please don't do it.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.320
Shh!

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.120
What are you doing?

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.419
Listen carefully.

00:12:57.419 --> 00:12:58.419
Yes.

00:12:59.919 --> 00:13:02.159
When we fly the kite next time...

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:03.600
Huh?

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.000
What are you two whispering about?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
We weren't, Snork Maiden,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I was just saying to Snif that the kite wouldn't fall down again.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
It won't, Snork is fixed it!

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
But you can't be absolutely sure!

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And you'll be holding the kite, won't you, Snif?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Me?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Now then, do you want to do it, Moomin?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Yes, and this time I'll let out all the line.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And Snif, you could hold it up, okay?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Yes, that's fine.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
No!

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.559
I'm counting on you, sniff.

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:34.559
And so am I, sniff.

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:35.559
Hmm.

00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:46.000
Are you sure you'll be alright? Of course I will, silly.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Well I'm not so sure.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Why don't you keep your eyes closed then?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Good idea.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Okay, now let's do it when I say ready.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Hi.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Ready! Yeah! Oh!

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Oh!

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Oh!

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Oh!

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Oh!

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Oh!

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Oh!

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Oh!

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Oh!

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Oh!

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:42.200
Oh! Oh! Oh

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:44.559
That's it that's all of the line

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
It's very high must be some wind up there. It's flying really well, isn't it?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Certainly is. Oh! What's that? Let's see, there's something very strange happening on that kite.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Huh! What is it? I can't see properly from here.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I saw something.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Could it be a bird, maybe?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
The kite is turned again, but it wasn't a bird.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Or a twig or something, then.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
I doubt it.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Can you see the back of the kite from where you are, Sniff?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
No, Mom and Mama, because my eyes are closed.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Oh. I think I know who it is.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Little Mai.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
What?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.600
No, I haven't seen all my fur.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.200
She seems to have disappeared.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.399
Don't ask me anything.

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:41.399
I know nothing at all about it.

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:43.399
Sniff, what do you mean?

00:15:43.399 --> 00:15:46.000
No, she was dead set on riding the it. Sniff, what do you mean?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
No, she was dead set on riding the kite. I couldn't stop her.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
What?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Moment, bring it down very slowly.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Huh?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Take it easy, moving. That wind is strong strong it could break the line.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
But that was what a grand was best stream.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
It's the knot I wore in the board knot.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
The warmth between our line and the bit that was still hanging from the kite when we found it.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:44.320
The knot is fine if the knot is another method. Oh

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Hang on tight little Marl. That wind is getting stronger. Oh, this is more scarier than I thought.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
I'll just have to hang on as best as I can.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Don't move around so much.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I can't help it.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
It's almost down.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I'm going to take a little more. I can't move. Don't move around so much.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I can't help it.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
It's almost down.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
What?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
It's the open.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Come on.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Jeff, get up over.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
All right.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Snort, play yourself together.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Yes, all right.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
She's being blown away towards Lonely Mountain.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Snort me out.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Ooh, I do hope little My really is indestructible.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Where in the world is this guy taking me?

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
All lonely mountains, I'm a long way from home.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Little My! Little Mai!

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Now she's going towards the forest of witches!

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
She'll be alright if she fell into a tree, wouldn't she?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
I can't see her, there's no sign of her!

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Well, I'm almost sure she was heading this way.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
What is it, Sniff?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Imagine she might have fallen somewhere, she might be lying there waiting for help.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Oh, stop imagining things, Sniff.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
She's still up there. I'm sure of it.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Huh?

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
What is it, Papa?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
I saw something up there.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Little Mai?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
No, Sniff.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.299
No, it looked more like the hobg goblin riding his panther through the sky.

00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:46.299
Really?

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:49.299
Did you see that? Did you?

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:51.299
You found me lying.

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:54.799
No, the hob goblin.

00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:55.799
Then it was him.

00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:58.500
Forget the hob goblin. We're looking for little lion.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:26.000
All you can think of is the hob goblin. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, I'm not going to sleep. I'm not going to sleep. I'm not going to sleep.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
I'm not going to sleep.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I'm not going to sleep.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
I'm not going to sleep.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
I'm not going to sleep.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
I'm not going to sleep.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
I'm not going to sleep.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I'm not going to sleep.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
I'm not going to sleep.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I'm not going to sleep. I'm not going to sleep. I'm not going to sleep. Where could she be?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
This is no good. We'll never find her wondering about like this.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Moomin over here.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
You found her?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:10.000
There she is.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Try to cheer up, Snork Maiden. I'll try.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Don't worry, Snork Maiden.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Movement Pupp will find her for sure.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Eh?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Mama, Snork Maiden!

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Feel the light. Mama, snork maiden! Oh, I'm so glad to see you, but I just knew you'd be alright.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:46.400
Like Moomin Mama said, little lie really is indestructible, but just possibly it served her right to have her hair pulled.

00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:53.599
Mmm, there's still no sign of little My?

00:20:53.599 --> 00:20:54.599
No.

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:08.000
Be careful, Momen!

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Doom!

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
What the fuck?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Hang on, Momen! Help me, Momen, Papa!

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Finally, the name was rescued too.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.900
But he almost certainly had a fine worst scare than the

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:46.000
blind. Leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
They're always happy and goes at play

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
The movements are having fun day after day

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
The movements

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
The movements

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
The movements The moon, the moon
