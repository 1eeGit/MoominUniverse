1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,600
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come.

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,880
Come on and sit down here with me, they're for you on your TV, they are the movements,

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,880
they are the movements.

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,120
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:44,480
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:55,840
the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,840
there were the movements.

8
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:39,040
Fall has come to movement valley and the memory of sunshine filled ours fades as the days

9
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,840
become shorter and the nights longer.

10
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,040
The wind blows away the falling leaves and the blue skies of summer are now grey and

11
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,040
cloudy, winter is just around the corner.

12
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,040
Snork maiden!

13
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,040
Where are you going?

14
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Oh I'm just taking my brother, his lunch little my, he must have nearly finished the flying

15
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
ship by now.

16
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Oh no, not even snork works that quickly.

17
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,040
Well have you seen it?

18
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,040
No I haven't, he won't even let me come into his workshop.

19
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,840
Is he afraid it'll disappear if someone sees it?

20
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,320
He hasn't said why but I suppose all great inventors have to be very careful, someone

21
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,040
might want to steal their ideas.

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,040
The woman told me he's dying to have a look at it.

23
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:43,040
Hey woman, open the door, I've got my hands full, come on quickly.

24
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,040
Look what I've got, it's a regular player.

25
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,040
Oh.

26
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Do you think you can get it working dear?

27
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,040
Oh yes of course mom.

28
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Why do people always give me things that are broken, it'd be nice to have something that

29
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,040
worked for a change.

30
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,040
Movement probably will get it working for you.

31
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,040
My auntie said that the record was alright though it stands music, she's had it for ages

32
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
but I've never heard it.

33
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Oh that's nice, it's years since I danced but it seems like only yesterday.

34
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,040
Do you remember what fun it was Papa?

35
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,040
Dancing.

36
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,040
Oh yeah, I see.

37
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Have you fixed it Papa?

38
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
Huh?

39
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
I can hear music.

40
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,040
Doesn't sound like snuffkin.

41
00:03:49,040 --> 00:04:16,040
Right, have you got the idea now?

42
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Yes I think so.

43
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
Me too.

44
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Come on, let's see you then.

45
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,040
What?

46
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Did I do it?

47
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Oh wow.

48
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Look at Papa woman, he's a great dancer.

49
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Well then, can you dance snuff?

50
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,040
I've never tried.

51
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Right, well try now.

52
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,040
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

53
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Yep.

54
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Hi, yeah.

55
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Hi, hi.

56
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Hey, hey.

57
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Hi, hey, hey, hey, hey.

58
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Oh that was fun.

59
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Oh, dancing never used to wear me out like this.

60
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,040
You've got no sense of rhythm at all, Snuff.

61
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,040
It's still dance though, can't I?

62
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Oh, are you ready, Papa?

63
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
I think I'll have to sit this one out, Mama.

64
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,040
All right.

65
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
You all right?

66
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
No, thank you.

67
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
I'll dance on my own.

68
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Well then, why don't you dance with me and dance, Smith?

69
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Ah.

70
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Hmm.

71
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Oh.

72
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Oh, it looks like it's here for the day.

73
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Oh, what horrible weather, snuffkin.

74
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Yes.

75
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
They're having fun.

76
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Well, Smith brought this old record player over and we've been dancing.

77
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
I haven't done it for years and years.

78
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,040
Well, aren't you coming in?

79
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
I can smell winter in the air, Moomin, Papa.

80
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Huh?

81
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Oh, yes.

82
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Yeah, all right.

83
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Snuffkin, why?

84
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Snuffkin, come and dance with me.

85
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
No, thanks.

86
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Sorry.

87
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Oh, you.

89
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Hmm, what's the matter with this?

90
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
I'm afraid it's broken.

91
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Just when we were having so much fun.

92
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Will you be able to fix it again, dear?

93
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
No, even I can't mend it now.

94
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Oh, please, try, Papa.

95
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
Will you?

96
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Hmm, snuffkin, do you know anything about record players?

97
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
No, I'm afraid not.

98
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
Oh, dear.

99
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
But what?

100
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,040
I'll play my harmonic if you want to continue to dance.

101
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
And then you can fiddle around with the machine.

102
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
How would that be?

103
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
Oh, yes, please.

104
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
That'd be great, snuffkin.

105
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
Thanks.

106
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,040
Now then, what would be a good tune to dance to?

107
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
Let's see.

108
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Oh, no.

109
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Oh, no.

110
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Now what's this?

111
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,040
Oh, no.

112
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,040
I give up.

113
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
Me?

114
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Me?

115
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,040
You're thinking about going away again, aren't you, Snuffkin?

116
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Hmm.

117
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I know that you go south every year when winter comes, but I'll still miss you, though,

118
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,040
and I wish you could stay here in Moomin Valley.

119
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
I know, Moomin.

120
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
Where are they?

121
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
How do you find them, I think?

122
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,040
I wonder where they're going.

123
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
I don't know.

124
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
A deserted island, I expect.

125
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
Probably the best place for them.

126
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
When are you leaving, Snuffkin?

127
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Oh, I haven't decided yet.

128
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,040
So, you'll be here for a bit longer then.

129
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Do you know where you're going?

130
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
No.

131
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,040
It must be fun traveling.

132
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
Yes, most of the time.

133
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,040
It's the best way of meeting new people and still being on your own.

134
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,040
I wish we could do that, but even when we hibernate and go to sleep, we're never really alone.

135
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,040
I guess I'd hibernate too if I had to stay up here in Moomin.

136
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
During all the freezing winter snows.

137
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,040
Do you think I could go south with Snuffkin, Papa?

138
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Not really, it's the moment way to hibernate.

139
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,040
It's a family custom passed down through the years by our ancestors.

140
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,040
But Papa, I don't want to go to sleep for months on end.

141
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
I want to travel south with Snuffkin.

142
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
Oh, Moomin.

143
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,040
You promise you'll be back on the first day of spring.

144
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
Oh, Mama!

145
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Does that mean I can really go?

146
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,040
I can't wait to tell Snuffkin.

147
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
I can, can't I?

148
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Well, if you really want to, I don't suppose we'll stop you.

149
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
We'll be Papa.

150
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Now, my parents didn't mind when I traveled around in my youth.

151
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
So, yes, all right, Moomin.

152
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,040
Oh, thank you, Papa.

153
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Mama, thank you, Mama.

154
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,040
That's great, but what will Snuffkin say?

155
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Well, it's a good idea.

156
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,040
And I got to say it'd be fun to have you a long Moomin.

157
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,040
So, I can come with you Snuffkin?

158
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
No.

159
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
What?

160
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,040
I'm sorry, but I've got to go on my own.

161
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
Don't be disappointed, Moomin.

162
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,040
I told you I travel alone.

163
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
I need to.

164
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,040
After spending the rest of the year here, just as I need to be here,

165
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
after spending the winter alone.

166
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,040
And the joy of returning to Moomin Valley is something I wouldn't miss.

167
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Which Snuffkin, I thought.

168
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,040
The time will soon pass, and you'll be asleep through most of it.

169
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
You won't notice I'm not here.

170
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
I'll see you next spring, Moomin.

171
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,040
I'll be back on the first day as usual.

172
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
I promise, as soon as the weather warms.

173
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,040
And when the flowers start to grow, nothing will keep me from Moomin Valley.

174
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,040
Ah, I'm sorry I didn't work out for you, Moomin.

175
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Oh, it's all right.

176
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Oh, come on, Moomin.

177
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
You'll have to tie them a bit tighter than that.

178
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,040
It'll be a cold winter, so we'll need lots of wood

179
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
to keep us going till spring comes.

180
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
I know.

181
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Now you want to stay warm, don't you?

182
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,040
When I grow up, I'll go south on my own, too.

183
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,040
Yes, of course you will.

184
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Ah, ah, ah.

185
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
Is Moomin home?

186
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
Yes.

187
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,040
How is he?

188
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Is he still down in the dumps?

189
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,040
I'm afraid so, grandma's cheer you up, recipe didn't work.

190
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,040
Ah, I think he's being silly just because Snuffkin's going away.

191
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
I suppose he is.

192
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
But don't worry, mama.

193
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,040
He won't be miserable much longer, because I've got a surprise for him.

194
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Are you there, Moomin?

195
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
A moment, don't cry.

196
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Boys don't cry, I suppose.

197
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Of course they do.

198
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Well, I'm not crying so, there.

199
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,040
All right, but I do think you should get up now.

200
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Oh, and why should I?

201
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
I have a surprise for you.

202
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
I don't want any surprises.

203
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,040
Come on, I'm going to go and see Snuffkin his workshop.

204
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
But you know he won't let us in.

205
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,040
I've tried before.

206
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
Oh, yes, he will today.

207
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
I promise.

208
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
What?

209
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,040
You mean Snorkel shows his flying ship at last?

210
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Yes, he said.

211
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Has he really finished it then?

212
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
No, not yet.

213
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
There's still a lot of work to do on him.

214
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Then I wonder why he's letting us see it.

215
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,040
He's always refused before.

216
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,040
What's made him change his mind?

217
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,040
But I asked him this time.

218
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,040
I said I wanted to show it to you.

219
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
It just needed a woman's touch.

220
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
What did you say to him?

221
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
First, he said absolutely not.

222
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
But when I told him how ill you were in that,

223
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
you probably wouldn't be with us much longer.

224
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
He gave in and said we could see it.

225
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,040
Just you and me have claimed not that it'll snorke maiden.

226
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Oh, good.

227
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Because sometimes some people are very depressed

228
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
and just lying bad.

229
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,040
They've done something bad.

230
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Oh, stop it snorke maiden.

231
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Don't say things like that.

232
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
I'm only trying to cheer you up.

233
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,040
So remember, don't tell us all.

234
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
No one else must know anything about it.

235
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Okay.

236
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Let's go.

237
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
No.

238
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Oh, little Mai.

239
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Little Mai.

240
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Trouble.

241
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Big Trouble.

242
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
We must fool her.

243
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Yes, but how?

244
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
What can we do?

245
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
I know what we'll do.

246
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
What?

247
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Quick, Moomin.

248
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,040
You just agree with everything I say snorke maiden.

249
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Oh.

250
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,040
I thought you were in bad Moomin.

251
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,040
No, we're going to see snorke.

252
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
Yes.

253
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
Really?

254
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Yes, he needs to clear a runway

255
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
for when the flying ship is finished.

256
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
We're going to help him do it.

257
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
That's all.

258
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
Yes.

259
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,040
Are you really, Moomin?

260
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
You got out of bad to do that.

261
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,040
I'm afraid I find it very strange that snorke is asked to go along

262
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,040
and help him cut down bushes and dig up roots and things.

263
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,040
You might have noticed I'm not a complete fool.

264
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,040
But it's true, little Mai.

265
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,040
Oh, yes.

266
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Well, at least you could have invented a better lie.

267
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,040
You must think I'm pretty stupid to believe a pathetic story like that.

268
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,040
But it's the truth.

269
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,040
And we need your help.

270
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
Yeah.

271
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
Don't bother, don't bother.

272
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
I don't want to hear anymore.

273
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
I think it's very sad that you have to pretend.

274
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
You're trying to hide something from me

275
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,040
and I'm not interested in what sort of sneaky underhanded thing it is.

276
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
But little Mai.

277
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,040
No, but, and anyway, I'm a little too busy at the moment

278
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,040
to take any notice of what's going on.

279
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Goodbye.

280
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Come on.

281
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Phew, that was close.

282
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Yeah.

283
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Ha, think, thank you.

284
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Keep a secret from me, do they?

285
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Are you alone?

286
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
Of course we are.

287
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,040
I promised, didn't I?

288
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,040
Come in, then.

289
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,040
Wow.

290
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
It's nearly ready, isn't it?

291
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Oh, no, there's a lot more to do.

292
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
The machine isn't half finished yet.

293
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,040
And as you can see, there's a lot to do on the ship itself

294
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,040
but I'm getting there slowly.

295
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,040
I never thought it would be so fantastic, smork.

296
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Well, I suppose you could say the design wasn't a complete failure.

297
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,040
I'm quite sure it'll fly beautifully.

298
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Oh, thank you.

299
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Do you really think it will, woman?

300
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
I can see it now.

301
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,040
High up in the air, dodging in and out of the clouds,

302
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
way up above the world.

303
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Well, I'm glad to see that you're so perceptive and quite right.

304
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Oh, how very thoughtful of me.

305
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Shouldn't you sit down and rest?

306
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
Do you know your illness?

307
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,040
It doesn't help to get too excited.

308
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
Ha, I shouldn't worry, smork.

309
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
There's nothing wrong with him.

310
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Oh, little my, how did you get in here?

311
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Throw that door.

312
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
But I always keep it.

313
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,040
Oh, oh, oh, no.

314
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,040
I must have forgotten to lock it.

315
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,040
And it's a bit late to do it now, isn't it?

316
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,040
But don't worry.

317
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,040
If I wanted to get in, I'd get in locks or no locks.

318
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Oh, you lied to us, little my.

319
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
Of course, but so did you.

320
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
Telling me that stupid story.

321
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,040
Now we're even, right?

322
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Now, listen, little my.

323
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Don't ever tell anybody what you see over here.

324
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
All right.

325
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,040
This invention contains so many outstanding new features

326
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,040
it is difficult to know where to begin.

327
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,040
But let me start with the most exciting part

328
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,040
of the whole construction.

329
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,040
It could go as a dream or rather the concept of a dream

330
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:17,040
thrilling, beautiful, impossible, dangerous.

331
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Can you take the ship down, movement?

332
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,040
I'd like you to land at that side of the lake.

333
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Oh, why do you want to get off?

334
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,040
Aren't you having fun flying about up here?

335
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
I want to be on my own.

336
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
Oh, please stay here.

337
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
I'll let you steer.

338
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
I'll be there.

339
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
I'll be there.

340
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
I'll be there.

341
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
I'll be there.

342
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
I'll be there.

343
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
I'll be there.

344
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
I'll be there.

345
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
I'll be there.

346
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
I'll be there.

347
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
I'll be there.

348
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Oh, please stay here.

349
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
I'll let you steer if you want.

350
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
No, really, movement, please.

351
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Bye now.

352
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
No!

353
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Snuff me!

354
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Oh, oh, oh.

355
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,040
So long then, movement, my friend.

356
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
I'll see you again next year.

357
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,040
The first day of spring.

358
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,040
I'll see you again next year.

359
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Bye!

360
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Goodbye, then, Snuffkin.

361
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,040
Goodbye, then, Snuffkin!

362
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Off for the winter, Asian Nafkin?

363
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,360
Yes, goodbye, Mr. Hemmielin.

364
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,920
We'll be seeing you in the spring.

365
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,400
Yes, when the snows are gone.

366
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,280
Oh, to be young and follow the sun wherever it goes.

367
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,520
And so the snow fell and winter came to Moomin Valley.

368
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,160
And in Moomin's heart, Snuffkin and the spring seemed a long, long way away.

369
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,760
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

370
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:19,440
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

371
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,840
They're always happy and always at play.

372
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,440
The movements are having fun day after day.

373
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,040
The movements.

374
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,040
The movements.

375
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:41,440
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

376
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:49,040
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

377
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,200
They're always happy and always at play.

378
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,800
The movements are having fun day after day.

379
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,640
The movements.

380
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,240
The movements.

381
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,240
The movements.
