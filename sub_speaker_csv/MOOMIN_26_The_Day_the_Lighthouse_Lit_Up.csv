118000,120700,"Dan, do you think it's broken, Papa?",117400,118500,"SPEAKER_12"
120700,124500,"Well, I'm not sure. I've not had a great deal of experience with this sort of thing.",119200,120800,"SPEAKER_12"
130100,133400,"Look over there, Moomin. It's the boy and the fisherman from the boat.",120800,124400,"SPEAKER_08"
135300,136900,"They're a bit strange, aren't they?",135300,136800,"SPEAKER_10"
137000,138900,"They must live somewhere here on the island.",135300,136800,"SPEAKER_10"
141900,142900,"Let's see.",141700,143000,"SPEAKER_08"
148000,148500,"What?",148000,148300,"SPEAKER_04"
158000,162500,"Oh, thank you. Leave it by the door when you haven't quite finished yet.",157900,162700,"SPEAKER_01"
163500,165500,"Well, at least we can see the floor now.",157900,162700,"SPEAKER_01"
166000,168000,"I think the keeper must be lying dead under the desk.",165700,168200,"SPEAKER_12"
170000,173000,"Nobody's cleaned here for a long time. That's for sure.",165700,168200,"SPEAKER_12"
173000,176500,"That probably means the lighthouse lamp hasn't been working for ages either.",170100,176700,"SPEAKER_10"
177500,179500,"I wonder if Papa will be able to fix it.",177300,179200,"SPEAKER_09"
180500,183500,"I wonder if they're going to manage to get the light working all right.",179800,180100,"SPEAKER_09"
186500,189500,"Well, the lighthouse without a lamp is pretty sad, isn't it?",186400,189100,"SPEAKER_09"
194500,196500,"Come on, light, will you?",186400,189100,"SPEAKER_09"
196500,198500,"Right, I'll give you one last chance.",194600,198700,"SPEAKER_08"
202500,206000,"Then I'm getting the big spanner. Now you don't know me, but I don't give in easily.",202400,225900,"SPEAKER_08"
206000,207500,"Especially to machines.",202400,225900,"SPEAKER_08"
207500,216000,"Have you thought brass brain what will happen tonight if there's a storm and there's a ship out there looking for land or trying to keep off the rocks and there's no light to guide them?",202400,225900,"SPEAKER_08"
216000,218000,"You'll be sorry Dan, but it'll be too late.",202400,225900,"SPEAKER_08"
218000,225500,"And all I can say is that if the light hasn't been working for some time that I'm afraid that there could have been many shipwrecks.",202400,225900,"SPEAKER_08"
225500,226500,"Oh, that's awful.",202400,225900,"SPEAKER_08"
226500,230500,"Well, it would be dangerous to come too close to the island without a light to help you.",225900,227100,"SPEAKER_10"
230500,233000,"I wouldn't be surprised if that ghost ship went one of them.",227100,233200,"SPEAKER_08"
234000,240000,"It all seems very strange, and I wonder what made the lighthouse keeper leave in such a hurry.",227100,233200,"SPEAKER_08"
240000,244000,"Unspeakable horror. Please be quiet, little my.",235600,239900,"SPEAKER_07"
244000,249000,"It's obvious. Close, thrown above dishes left unwashed, jigsaw puzzles have finished.",241500,258300,"SPEAKER_12"
249000,253000,"It's an unsolved mystery of the sea, just like the Marie Celeste.",241500,258300,"SPEAKER_12"
253000,258000,"And if you don't understand that, then you're being even stupider. Then usual.",241500,258300,"SPEAKER_12"
258000,262000,"Oh, dear poor man, I wonder what he was like.",241500,258300,"SPEAKER_12"
262000,266000,"He must have been very lonely here on his own.",261200,262400,"SPEAKER_01"
266000,270000,"He scribbled messages over the walls like no side of a ship.",262700,264800,"SPEAKER_07"
270000,276000,"It's Christmas, another month gone. I must clean the lamp, and I need to talk to someone.",267000,275800,"SPEAKER_07"
278000,283000,"Oh, well, if he didn't see many ships, at least they could have been many shipwrecks either.",267000,275800,"SPEAKER_07"
283000,287000,"Oh, I hope not, Papa. That would be one good thing anyway.",278400,283100,"SPEAKER_08"
287000,292000,"Perhaps the sea came and took him on a dark and stormy night, and he was swept out and no one saw him go.",287000,292300,"SPEAKER_12"
292000,299000,"That's rubbish, little my. On dark and stormy nights, lighthouse keeper sits safe by a fire drinking hot tea laced with rum.",287000,292300,"SPEAKER_12"
299000,302000,"He might have run out of rum and gone to get more.",294300,294400,"SPEAKER_12"
302000,309000,"Well, I don't think anything terrible happened to him. He just got more and more lonely and fed up and then went off and got a girlfriend.",299800,302100,"SPEAKER_12"
309000,314000,"Be careful, snuffkin. It's very rough, but not even, and you don't want to fall into the sea.",307900,314400,"SPEAKER_10"
314000,318000,"I certainly don't. Now, watch your step. The rocks are very slippery.",307900,314400,"SPEAKER_10"
318000,322000,"Well, are you all right?",314700,318200,"SPEAKER_07"
322000,326000,"Yes, Lang, so I didn't think they'd be a slippery is all that.",321200,321900,"SPEAKER_07"
326000,331000,"What's the matter? Look over there. There's something moving, but I can't see what it is.",322300,325900,"SPEAKER_10"
331000,333000,"It's probably a boat.",327900,331300,"SPEAKER_10"
333000,336000,"No, that's what I call a real ship.",331800,332900,"SPEAKER_07"
336000,338000,"It's not a real one.",333600,335800,"SPEAKER_10"
338000,339000,"What do you mean?",336600,337600,"SPEAKER_07"
339000,343000,"It's the ghost ship, the one we saw last night.",338200,338900,"SPEAKER_10"
343000,348000,"You're right. Why isn't it come back, snuffkin? What does it want?",341400,343100,"SPEAKER_07"
348000,354000,"I don't know. Perhaps it followed us to the island and for some reason wants to make contact.",346900,348000,"SPEAKER_10"
360000,364000,"Let's go home, snuffkin. I don't like this.",360000,361600,"SPEAKER_10"
373000,379000,"What's up?",362200,363500,"SPEAKER_10"
379000,391000,"Oh, no. Shut up. I'm having a great dream, and you can see the view.",374900,375300,"SPEAKER_11"
391000,395000,"Wait. Oh, it was horrible. Someone stepped on my face.",390600,391800,"SPEAKER_10"
395000,399000,"Well, none of us sleepwalking since we were all asleep. Why don't you just be quiet?",392400,4e+05,"SPEAKER_11"
399000,404000,"They're very odd.",392400,4e+05,"SPEAKER_11"
404000,410000,"No, somebody's on my stomach now. Don't be stupid.",401300,401700,"SPEAKER_10"
410000,416000,"Oh, have a look, snuffkin. There must be something there. Please, snuffkin, please.",404500,409100,"SPEAKER_10"
416000,420000,"I can't see any. What's that?",416000,417200,"SPEAKER_07"
420000,421000,"What is it?",419900,421000,"SPEAKER_10"
421000,425000,"I don't know yet, movement. I think I can see a pair of feet.",421000,421000,"SPEAKER_04"
425000,427000,"A pair of feet.",423400,425000,"SPEAKER_07"
427000,429000,"My legs just feet.",425400,428500,"SPEAKER_07"
429000,431000,"But that means a ghost.",425400,428500,"SPEAKER_07"
431000,434000,"Oh, help. Get it off me. Go away, go away.",430400,437900,"SPEAKER_12"
434000,440000,"Let me at them. Where are they? I'll teach them to spoil my dream.",430400,437900,"SPEAKER_12"
440000,442000,"They're on my face now. Go away, will you?",439900,442100,"SPEAKER_07"
442000,445000,"No. Show me it. But no, stamp on it.",441400,446900,"SPEAKER_12"
445000,446000,"Stop it, move away.",441400,446900,"SPEAKER_12"
446000,449000,"No, it's my fault.",441400,446900,"SPEAKER_12"
457000,467000,"You go fishing again today. No, I'm not.",441400,446900,"SPEAKER_12"
467000,472000,"Oh, do you need me or is it all right if I go and see those people in the lighthouse?",466900,470200,"SPEAKER_09"
472000,474000,"No, I don't want you one.",470600,471500,"SPEAKER_09"
474000,478000,"Okay, goodbye then.",473700,475000,"SPEAKER_09"
481000,484000,"You mean this room is really haunted?",473700,475000,"SPEAKER_09"
484000,486000,"It certainly is.",481600,483700,"SPEAKER_08"
486000,489000,"But we only saw a pair of feet.",485800,487000,"SPEAKER_08"
489000,492000,"I'll sleep here tonight. Don't worry, I'll protect you.",487000,487000,"SPEAKER_07"
489000,492000,"I'll sleep here tonight. Don't worry, I'll protect you.",487000,487900,"SPEAKER_08"
492000,495000,"Are you going to scare it away, Papa?",491800,493800,"SPEAKER_10"
498000,5e+05,"I can't find any good shells.",494000,494800,"SPEAKER_08"
5e+05,502000,"You're me.",498800,501100,"SPEAKER_12"
506000,508000,"What about this one?",502100,502900,"SPEAKER_12"
508000,510000,"Oh yes, that's lovely.",507600,507900,"SPEAKER_11"
511000,514000,"Go on, take it. I don't collect them.",507600,507900,"SPEAKER_11"
517000,518000,"Who are you?",513100,514700,"SPEAKER_07"
518000,520000,"Well, I'm a ghost, sort of.",517400,518300,"SPEAKER_12"
520000,522000,"Are you the rat who walked over us last night?",518700,520900,"SPEAKER_07"
522000,524000,"You were lucky I didn't grab you.",520900,524700,"SPEAKER_12"
524000,527000,"Sorry, it wasn't just me. There were a few of us.",520900,524700,"SPEAKER_12"
527000,528000,"Now walk over each other.",524700,527600,"SPEAKER_07"
528000,530000,"Can I give you a present?",527400,528900,"SPEAKER_12"
530000,532000,"You can't get around me that easily.",529000,530500,"SPEAKER_07"
532000,534000,"You better show yourselves or you'll be sorry.",530700,534700,"SPEAKER_12"
534000,539000,"It's just me. The others have all left me and gone off with the ship.",530700,534700,"SPEAKER_12"
539000,542000,"Ha, so why didn't you go with them?",535300,539100,"SPEAKER_07"
542000,545000,"Oh, I wanted to, but well...",539400,541900,"SPEAKER_12"
545000,546000,"Come on, out with it.",542400,547700,"SPEAKER_12"
546000,547000,"Well...",545300,545800,"SPEAKER_07"
547000,552000,"Never got me and let me all of my own and I was frightened.",546600,547300,"SPEAKER_07"
552000,556000,"Well, I can see why they wouldn't want a drippy thing like you around.",547700,553100,"SPEAKER_07"
556000,558000,"You call yourself a ghost.",552800,556200,"SPEAKER_12"
558000,561000,"I know, I'm sorry.",558000,558000,"SPEAKER_07"
558000,561000,"I know, I'm sorry.",558000,563900,"SPEAKER_08"
561000,564000,"I just can't work out what's wrong with it.",558000,558000,"SPEAKER_07"
561000,564000,"I just can't work out what's wrong with it.",558000,563900,"SPEAKER_08"
564000,567000,"Let's try and see what happens here.",558000,558000,"SPEAKER_07"
564000,567000,"Let's try and see what happens here.",558000,563900,"SPEAKER_08"

575000,576000,"Oh, no!",574500,574600,"SPEAKER_09"
584000,585000,"You were right, Pop-Up!",583200,583900,"SPEAKER_08"
585000,587000,"Oh, thank goodness you are here, quick!",584300,589900,"SPEAKER_08"
587000,589000,"Open all the windows, I'm choking!",586600,587100,"SPEAKER_04"

595000,597000,"Oh, my God.",593300,593300,"SPEAKER_04"
610000,614000,"Mmm, this is great. That soup I've had for ages, Moome and Mama.",593300,593300,"SPEAKER_04"
614000,615000,"Would you like some more?",610300,615600,"SPEAKER_09"
615000,617000,"Oh, he has, please.",610300,615600,"SPEAKER_09"
617000,622000,"Can I have the recipe? I could make some for the fisherman. I know he'd love it.",615700,617200,"SPEAKER_09"
622000,625000,"I'll write it out for you. What's his name?",617900,622000,"SPEAKER_09"
625000,627000,"I don't know. He doesn't say.",622600,624700,"SPEAKER_01"
627000,631000,"I've come from the north. I left about three months ago,",625100,626900,"SPEAKER_09"
631000,636000,"although it seems a lot longer, and I'd been rowing south in my small boat,",628000,630800,"SPEAKER_09"
636000,638000,"trying to reach Moome and Valley.",631700,639400,"SPEAKER_09"
638000,640000,"Oh, really? We live there.",631700,639400,"SPEAKER_09"
640000,643000,"Do you? You're lucky. It must be very nice. I've never been there,",639900,652400,"SPEAKER_09"
643000,645000,"but I've heard that it's beautiful.",639900,652400,"SPEAKER_09"
645000,648000,"Anyway, there was a violent storm in my little boat capsized.",639900,652400,"SPEAKER_09"
648000,652000,"He rescued me, and I've stayed with him in his cabin ever since.",639900,652400,"SPEAKER_09"
652000,656000,"And he doesn't talk about himself at all. That's very strange.",639900,652400,"SPEAKER_09"
656000,659000,"No, but I think he does have a big secret.",653100,656500,"SPEAKER_01"
659000,661000,"How do you know, Taft?",656600,660000,"SPEAKER_09"
661000,666000,"Well, sometimes he just stares and stares at the lighthouse in any sort of size.",660300,660300,"SPEAKER_09"
661000,666000,"Well, sometimes he just stares and stares at the lighthouse in any sort of size.",660300,661400,"SPEAKER_01"
666000,667000,"I wonder why.",661600,673600,"SPEAKER_09"
667000,671000,"I did ask him once, but he glared at me in such a nasty way.",661600,673600,"SPEAKER_09"
671000,673000,"I haven't dared say a word about it since.",661600,673600,"SPEAKER_09"
673000,675000,"You don't want to stay with him then?",661600,673600,"SPEAKER_09"
676000,679000,"Oh, yes. Well, most of the time he's really nice to me,",674100,675700,"SPEAKER_01"
679000,682000,"and since I've been here, I've sort of taken care of him,",676200,684500,"SPEAKER_09"
682000,685000,"because you see he doesn't really look after himself.",676200,684500,"SPEAKER_09"
685000,688000,"Could I have a cup of tea, please, Mama?",676200,684500,"SPEAKER_09"
688000,691000,"Yes, dear. How is the light coming along?",686200,687800,"SPEAKER_08"
691000,694000,"Oh, not very well. There's still a few more things I could try, though.",689600,689600,"SPEAKER_01"
691000,694000,"Oh, not very well. There's still a few more things I could try, though.",689600,697200,"SPEAKER_08"
694000,697000,"Hello. You were on that boat fishing, weren't you?",689600,689600,"SPEAKER_01"
694000,697000,"Hello. You were on that boat fishing, weren't you?",689600,697200,"SPEAKER_08"
697000,7e+05,"Yes, I was. My name is Taft, Mum and Papa.",689600,689600,"SPEAKER_01"
697000,7e+05,"Yes, I was. My name is Taft, Mum and Papa.",689600,697200,"SPEAKER_08"
7e+05,702000,"Oh, please, to meet you.",697600,700500,"SPEAKER_09"
702000,705000,"Is your friend here as well? I wanted to ask him something.",700500,708000,"SPEAKER_08"
705000,707000,"There's something quite important.",700500,708000,"SPEAKER_08"
707000,708000,"Ask him what?",700500,708000,"SPEAKER_08"
708000,710000,"Well, about this lighthouse for one thing.",700500,708000,"SPEAKER_08"
710000,713000,"Well, he won't talk about that. He just refuses to.",708300,710400,"SPEAKER_08"
713000,715000,"Oh, dear, does he?",710300,713300,"SPEAKER_09"
715000,718000,"The thing is, I'm trying to light this beacon, but having no success.",713600,723300,"SPEAKER_08"
718000,721000,"I wondered whether he might know if there's an easy way of doing it.",713600,723300,"SPEAKER_08"
721000,724000,"You never know. I might have missed something.",713600,723300,"SPEAKER_08"
724000,726000,"It's very quiet.",713600,723300,"SPEAKER_08"
727000,729000,"He might be out fishing, you know.",724300,725500,"SPEAKER_08"
729000,731000,"Come on, let's go.",728900,729700,"SPEAKER_10"
731000,732000,"Where are you going, Moomin?",729700,729700,"SPEAKER_07"
732000,734000,"I want to ask that man some questions.",731200,732200,"SPEAKER_07"
734000,737000,"He doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who does a lot of talking.",732300,740000,"SPEAKER_07"
737000,740000,"Do you think he might know something about the lighthouse keeper?",732300,740000,"SPEAKER_07"
740000,742000,"That's what I want to find out.",732300,740000,"SPEAKER_07"
750000,754000,"Hello. My name is Moomin, and this is my friend, Snuffkin.",740200,741700,"SPEAKER_10"
754000,757000,"What's your business here?",750200,754100,"SPEAKER_10"
757000,760000,"I wonder, do you live here?",755000,756500,"SPEAKER_06"
760000,764000,"I suppose you must have met the lighthouse keeper, have you?",757200,759800,"SPEAKER_10"
764000,766000,"I don't want people to have other matters.",763900,765600,"SPEAKER_06"
766000,770000,"We were just curious about why you left the lighthouse. Do you know why?",765600,769200,"SPEAKER_10"
770000,773000,"No, you kept himself to himself.",765600,769200,"SPEAKER_10"
773000,776000,"Oh, so you do know it. When did he leave?",770400,772200,"SPEAKER_06"
776000,778000,"Where did he go? You must know.",773100,775400,"SPEAKER_10"
778000,779000,"Get.",777900,778200,"SPEAKER_06"
779000,783000,"Oh, please. Had the light stopped working before he left?",778600,779600,"SPEAKER_10"
783000,786000,"Why did he leave the door open? Were there any shipwrecks?",780400,812100,"SPEAKER_10"
787000,790000,"Wait a minute, just one more question, please.",780400,812100,"SPEAKER_10"
790000,791000,"Oh, don't go.",780400,812100,"SPEAKER_10"
791000,793000,"There's something very important I need to know.",780400,812100,"SPEAKER_10"
793000,796000,"You're the only other person on the island apart from the ghost ship.",780400,812100,"SPEAKER_10"
796000,798000,"Oh, no, please, come back.",780400,812100,"SPEAKER_10"
798000,802000,"Look, my father is trying to get the lamp working again, but not getting anywhere.",780400,812100,"SPEAKER_10"
802000,806000,"So if you know where the keeper is, or better still, how to light it,",780400,812100,"SPEAKER_10"
806000,807000,"will you please help?",780400,812100,"SPEAKER_10"
807000,811000,"It's not only for us, but for all those ships that might be in danger without it.",780400,812100,"SPEAKER_10"
812000,813000,"Oh.",780400,812100,"SPEAKER_10"
815000,816000,"Moomin.",812100,812700,"SPEAKER_10"
817000,820000,"I don't think that man knows much about anything.",815100,815700,"SPEAKER_07"
820000,824000,"Well, at least he's heard you and knows what you want.",817200,820000,"SPEAKER_10"
824000,825000,"Let's go, Moomin.",820500,823100,"SPEAKER_07"
825000,826000,"Moomin.",824400,825300,"SPEAKER_07"
840000,844000,"Look, over there, what's Moomin Papa doing?",840000,840300,"SPEAKER_07"
844000,847000,"Snort made an a little Maya helping him.",840900,842800,"SPEAKER_07"
847000,848000,"Hiya!",847000,847800,"SPEAKER_12"
849000,850000,"Come on.",847000,847800,"SPEAKER_12"
850000,851000,"Yeah.",849500,849500,"SPEAKER_10"
850000,851000,"Yeah.",849500,849500,"SPEAKER_07"
850000,851000,"Yeah.",849500,850100,"SPEAKER_10"
852000,856000,"It's about time. Where are you two being?",850100,850300,"SPEAKER_12"
856000,858000,"What are you building now?",854600,856600,"SPEAKER_12"
858000,859000,"We're making a raft.",856600,858000,"SPEAKER_10"
859000,860000,"Why?",858200,860000,"SPEAKER_10"
860000,861000,"Because we wanted to stupid.",858200,860000,"SPEAKER_10"
861000,862000,"Why else would we build it?",860100,867400,"SPEAKER_12"
862000,863000,"Do you like it?",860100,867400,"SPEAKER_12"
863000,865000,"But why do you want a raft?",860100,867400,"SPEAKER_12"
865000,867000,"It's not really a raft, is it Papa?",860100,867400,"SPEAKER_12"
867000,871000,"Let me present our very own hand-built ghost ship.",860100,867400,"SPEAKER_12"
871000,872000,"A ghost ship?",867900,871400,"SPEAKER_08"
875000,877000,"He must be here somewhere.",871400,872600,"SPEAKER_12"
877000,880000,"Well, if he's the one that walked on me last night,",876500,877800,"SPEAKER_12"
880000,882000,"I want a word with him.",878000,881600,"SPEAKER_10"
882000,883000,"Yes, sorry.",878000,881600,"SPEAKER_10"
883000,885000,"I'm afraid that was me and my friends.",882100,885700,"SPEAKER_07"
885000,887000,"Oh, where are you?",882100,885700,"SPEAKER_07"
887000,888000,"Show us a bit of leg, at least.",885700,887000,"SPEAKER_12"
888000,890000,"I like to see you I'm talking to.",887500,890600,"SPEAKER_12"
890000,893000,"Yes, all right.",887500,890600,"SPEAKER_12"
893000,897000,"Oh, well, at least he looks like a ghost.",890800,892200,"SPEAKER_10"
897000,898000,"Thank you.",894500,897000,"SPEAKER_10"
898000,901000,"Ghosts look pretty silly when the sun's shining if you ask me.",897400,898500,"SPEAKER_07"
901000,903000,"Well, it was your idea.",898600,901700,"SPEAKER_12"
903000,905000,"I always thought ghosts were frightening me.",902000,903500,"SPEAKER_07"
905000,907000,"Yes, we forgot our chains last night.",903300,905600,"SPEAKER_12"
908000,910000,"It's very hard to be ghostly without them.",905400,911700,"SPEAKER_07"
910000,912000,"We did our best to scare you, though.",905400,911700,"SPEAKER_07"
912000,915000,"The ghost came to this island because the lighthouse was a bit like an ancient castle.",911700,915100,"SPEAKER_12"
915000,917000,"We feel more at home in castle.",911700,915100,"SPEAKER_12"
917000,920000,"And now when they found us here, they changed their minds and gave up.",915200,917400,"SPEAKER_07"
920000,922000,"That's funny, isn't it?",917200,921000,"SPEAKER_12"
922000,924000,"What's the matter?",917200,921000,"SPEAKER_12"
924000,926000,"You look a bit fed up.",922100,925500,"SPEAKER_10"
926000,929000,"That's because he's been left behind by the other ghosts.",922100,925500,"SPEAKER_10"
929000,931000,"They've gone off in the ghost ship.",927900,927900,"SPEAKER_10"
931000,934000,"Wow, they didn't tell me they were going straight away.",930700,936100,"SPEAKER_07"
934000,936000,"And I'd gone to the lighthouse keepers cabin.",930700,936100,"SPEAKER_07"
936000,938000,"The lighthouse keeper?",930700,936100,"SPEAKER_07"
938000,939000,"Why did you go there?",937000,937900,"SPEAKER_10"
939000,942000,"Well, I wanted to tell him that some strange people.",938400,939400,"SPEAKER_07"
942000,943000,"I'm sorry.",939700,953000,"SPEAKER_07"
943000,947000,"I mean, strangers had moved into the lighthouse and that he'd be better off with us",939700,953000,"SPEAKER_07"
947000,949000,"because ghosts don't damage things.",939700,953000,"SPEAKER_07"
949000,951000,"I didn't know you then, of course.",939700,953000,"SPEAKER_07"
951000,953000,"But some people are very kind.",939700,953000,"SPEAKER_07"
953000,954000,"Where is his cabin?",952600,954800,"SPEAKER_10"
954000,955000,"Is it easy to find?",952600,954800,"SPEAKER_10"
955000,957000,"At the southern end of the island.",952600,954800,"SPEAKER_10"
957000,960000,"But it was a waste of time because he wouldn't talk to me.",955400,966200,"SPEAKER_07"
960000,961000,"I shouldn't have bothered.",955400,966200,"SPEAKER_07"
961000,963000,"And then I would have caught the boat.",955400,966200,"SPEAKER_07"
963000,965000,"Anyway, he's not going back to his job.",955400,966200,"SPEAKER_07"
965000,967000,"So that's that.",955400,966200,"SPEAKER_07"
967000,968000,"Bye-bye.",955400,966200,"SPEAKER_07"
968000,970000,"Thanks again for the raft.",967700,967900,"SPEAKER_12"
970000,971000,"Take care.",967700,967900,"SPEAKER_12"
971000,974000,"I hope you catch up with your friends real soon.",970700,974300,"SPEAKER_12"
974000,975000,"Thank you.",970700,974300,"SPEAKER_12"
975000,976000,"You're okay for mortals.",974400,980500,"SPEAKER_07"
976000,979000,"I promise next time we meet up he rallies, Gary.",974400,980500,"SPEAKER_07"
979000,980000,"Chains and all.",978400,978600,"SPEAKER_12"
980000,981000,"Lots of chains.",978400,978600,"SPEAKER_12"
981000,983000,"And we promise to be terrified.",980500,986800,"SPEAKER_12"
983000,986000,"You can come and scare me anytime you want.",980500,986800,"SPEAKER_12"
986000,988000,"Bye-bye.",980500,986800,"SPEAKER_12"
988000,989000,"Relating a charm.",987200,989700,"SPEAKER_12"
989000,990000,"Bye-bye.",987200,989700,"SPEAKER_12"
990000,993000,"He said anything that could float would do.",989700,989900,"SPEAKER_07"
993000,995000,"But that raft seemed a bit flimsy to me.",989700,989900,"SPEAKER_07"
995000,996000,"I wouldn't like to chance it.",993900,1001000,"SPEAKER_08"
996000,998000,"It can be rough out there.",993900,1001000,"SPEAKER_08"
998000,1e+06,"Well, it doesn't matter anyway.",993900,1001000,"SPEAKER_08"
1e+06,1001000,"Ghost can't drown.",993900,1001000,"SPEAKER_08"
1001000,1002000,"Can they?",993900,1001000,"SPEAKER_08"
1002000,1003000,"They're dead already.",1001900,1006100,"SPEAKER_12"
1011000,1012000,"Mama.",1001900,1006100,"SPEAKER_12"
1012000,1014000,"What is it, Moomin, dear?",1001900,1006100,"SPEAKER_12"
1014000,1016000,"Poppa's gone fishing again.",1014000,1014800,"SPEAKER_01"
1016000,1018000,"Well, he's gone fishing again.",1015000,1016400,"SPEAKER_01"
1019000,1021000,"Well, he enjoys it.",1018800,1018800,"SPEAKER_10"
1021000,1024000,"Well, that's all he seems to do these days.",1019300,1020700,"SPEAKER_01"
1024000,1026000,"He's not working on the lamp at all.",1022100,1026000,"SPEAKER_10"
1026000,1029000,"Well, perhaps living in a new place makes him want to do a new thing.",1022100,1026000,"SPEAKER_10"
1029000,1032000,"And he does catch one now and again.",1026700,1031700,"SPEAKER_01"
1038000,1040000,"What are you making, little boy?",1038000,1039500,"SPEAKER_10"
1040000,1041000,"An elevator.",1039600,1040500,"SPEAKER_12"
1041000,1042000,"An elevator?",1039600,1040500,"SPEAKER_12"
1042000,1045000,"Yes, and when that's finished, I'm going to build a house.",1041200,1042100,"SPEAKER_10"
1045000,1047000,"Oh, my goodness.",1042500,1044800,"SPEAKER_12"
1047000,1049000,"A house of my very own.",1047000,1048500,"SPEAKER_12"
1060000,1063000,"Moomin, Papa, doesn't seem his usual happy self,",1059100,1059600,"SPEAKER_04"
1063000,1065000,"even though he enjoys his fishing.",1060300,1063000,"SPEAKER_05"
1065000,1069000,"He's upset that he couldn't make the lamp work and isn't used to failure,",1063300,1065000,"SPEAKER_05"
1069000,1072000,"but nothing he tries makes any difference.",1065800,1069300,"SPEAKER_05"
1072000,1076000,"What a pity it would be to leave the island without seeing the beautiful beams",1069600,1072000,"SPEAKER_05"
1076000,1078000,"shining over the water.",1072400,1077800,"SPEAKER_05"
1079000,1081000,"Oh, my goodness.",1072400,1077800,"SPEAKER_05"
1081000,1083000,"Oh, my goodness.",1072400,1077800,"SPEAKER_05"
1105000,1107000,"Yeah, hey, come and have a look.",1105000,1108500,"SPEAKER_12"
1107000,1109000,"Everyone, I finished my house.",1105000,1108500,"SPEAKER_12"
1110000,1113000,"Hey, Moomin, Papa, come here. The fisherman's coming.",1108900,1109400,"SPEAKER_12"
1113000,1115000,"Wow, the fisherman.",1110700,1113400,"SPEAKER_12"
1118000,1120000,"Yes, and the boy is with him.",1114400,1115500,"SPEAKER_08"
1120000,1121000,"The loft is outside.",1120000,1121000,"SPEAKER_10"
1128000,1130000,"You don't want to do it, do you?",1120000,1121000,"SPEAKER_10"
1130000,1132000,"No, but I've got to do it.",1128300,1130000,"SPEAKER_09"
1134000,1135000,"Right.",1130600,1132000,"SPEAKER_06"
1140000,1141000,"Here you are.",1135700,1135900,"SPEAKER_09"
1149000,1152000,"So, uh, what can we do for you?",1146300,1147300,"SPEAKER_01"
1159000,1160000,"Oh!",1158300,1158700,"SPEAKER_04"
1163000,1166000,"Happy birthday. Happy birthday to you.",1163000,1164800,"SPEAKER_01"
1166000,1167000,"Hmm?",1164800,1165700,"SPEAKER_08"
1167000,1170000,"Tough just told us it's your birthday today,",1166300,1166700,"SPEAKER_08"
1170000,1172000,"so all the best wishes from us.",1167400,1172500,"SPEAKER_08"
1172000,1175000,"My birthday? Is it really?",1167400,1172500,"SPEAKER_08"
1175000,1178000,"Excuse me for asking, but how old are you?",1174800,1174800,"SPEAKER_06"
1178000,1180000,"I just don't remember.",1175400,1178100,"SPEAKER_01"
1181000,1184000,"It doesn't matter. I'm sorry we don't have any presents.",1178800,1180500,"SPEAKER_06"
1187000,1190000,"I haven't had coffee for many, many years.",1181200,1184200,"SPEAKER_01"
1193000,1195000,"Bring the barrel, Moomin, Mama.",1187600,1190300,"SPEAKER_06"
1195000,1196000,"Yes, dear.",1193100,1195600,"SPEAKER_08"
1197000,1200000,"Now, let me see, I found this sauerster.",1197000,1199800,"SPEAKER_08"
1201000,1204000,"I wonder if it suits me. What do you think?",1197000,1199800,"SPEAKER_08"
