1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you are your TV, there are the movements, there are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
With all the excitement of that night, sniffed decided not to go home and was sharing movement's bed.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Snuffkin, as always, preferred to sleep in his tent.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You remember what happened, the horrible grok coming after thingamy and bob and everything freezing?

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
For a moment however, the night wasn't quite over yet.

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Lonely papa, help me, the grok is after me!

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can't run anymore!

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Run anymore!

14
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Why am I on the floor?

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Sniff?

16
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Morning Mama!

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Good morning Moomin, is sniff up yet?

18
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're joking, where is thingamy and bob?

19
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They haven't stirred yet, the poor things are tired out.

20
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Papa's not still asleep is he?

21
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No, he's looking at my rose bushes.

22
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Are they okay papa?

23
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, frozen to death and look.

24
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What?

25
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's where she was standing over there where the grass is dead.

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
She must have been real cold to freeze the roses, what a shame, they were very pretty.

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
There's not much left of them now, we'll have to grow some new ones.

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I dreamed that she was chasing me papa.

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh don't worry Moomin, I think she's only after thingamy and bob.

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So they're not fugitives from justice after all?

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I have a feeling that they would prefer that moment.

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Aren't thingamy and bob coming down?

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes, if they could have breakfast in their room if you didn't mind.

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, what did they tell you?

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What?

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
About why the groke is chasing them.

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, they just looked terrified and wouldn't say anything about her at all.

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You know, we really ought to find out why.

39
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes, you're right.

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Moomin Mama, why don't you take their breakfast up and see if they'll tell you anything

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
if any of us can get it out of the meal can.

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Who's that?

43
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's only me, I've brought you both a nice breakfast.

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Come here.

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Well, what did they say?

46
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It seems that the groke is after the suitcase, not them.

47
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I wonder what's in it, perhaps they've stolen her mummy as well.

48
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And they also said that it did use to belong to her.

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh dear, if they've stolen it.

50
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know about that.

51
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I asked them how they got it, but they wouldn't say another word.

52
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Well, this is too much.

53
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We could be harboring criminals.

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I know they don't look like it, but you never know, do you?

55
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You can ask the groke!

56
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't shout.

57
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No, that's no good.

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We don't want to come back here most definitely.

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's ask the police inspector to question them.

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We don't want to get the police involved.

61
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, you'll suggest something, Anne!

62
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Quit shouting, sniff!

63
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Look, why don't you just wait for them to tell you a moment?

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I know it seems strange, but I've noticed that if you pretend not to be interested,

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
people can't wait to tell you those secrets.

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They told Mama about the suitcase, but they wouldn't say anything to Papa.

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You know something, Moomin?

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They might open up to Snork Maiden.

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
She's someone more their own age.

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You could be right.

71
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hey, Snork Maiden!

72
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Where are you going?

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Moomin house.

74
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'll come with you, but I thought you were living there.

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I was until mumble came back yesterday.

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
How is she?

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Bossy, and she snores, too.

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Moomin!

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Snork Maiden!

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Where are you off to?

81
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Well, I was just on my way to see you.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, that's so nice, and I've come to see you, Moomin.

83
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I brought you a little present, Moomin.

84
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A present for me.

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes, and it's very beautiful.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What is it?

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Something you must never break or lose.

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I promise I won't.

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There you are.

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Thank you.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Go on, open it.

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
A lot of beautiful shell.

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I spent all of yesterday on the beach searching for it just for you.

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Look, we can see ourselves in it.

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So we can.

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Thank you very much, Snork Maiden.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's my heart, and I want you to look after me.

98
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh, I will, Snork Maiden.

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I will.

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll think of you whenever I look at it.

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm Moomin.

102
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I promise you that I'll always kiss the shell before I go to sleep.

103
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It will be my most precious treasure.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Apart from me?

105
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So what shall I do?

106
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Take them for a walk?

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes, but take your time, and don't rush them.

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'll let them cry on my shoulder.

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes, and try and talk to them as well, though.

110
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I feel very important, and a little bit nervous, too.

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Have some tea first.

112
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Thank you, Moomin, Mama.

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Ah!

114
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We don't need your help, Little My.

115
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Ha, that's what you think.

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'd be able to weadle out their secrets.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's not an interrogation.

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We only want to talk to them, you know?

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So you can weadle out their secrets.

120
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll be very quiet.

121
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Little My, have you ever managed to be very quiet?

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Not really, but there's only one way to find out.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You must let me go with Snork Maiden.

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No, this situation needs a tender understanding, Moomin.

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's me, exactly!

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You ready?

127
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I suppose so.

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hello, it's Moomin.

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Can I talk to you for a minute?

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Hello?

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is Snork Maiden.

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
She's a very good friend of mine.

133
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Hello, I'm very happy to meet you both.

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
She's very tender and understanding,

135
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and she'd like to talk to you.

136
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Can she come in?

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, if she has to, Moomin.

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Come in, Maiden.

139
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You pee, you pee, you pee.

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's very beautiful, a perfect heart shape.

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I've never seen anything like it, Moomin.

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Would you like one, Mama?

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No, my dear.

144
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There should only be one shell like this.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Then would you keep it somewhere safe for me?

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Well, self-kin.

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sure Snork Maiden will get it out of him.

148
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I do hope so.

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I think they like it anyway.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I have a feeling in my bones that Groke will be back tonight.

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
If we could find out why she's after them, we'd know what to do.

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Mama won't have any garden left if that monster comes back every night.

153
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Moomin.

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well done, Snork Maiden.

155
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Little Mai.

156
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh no, she'll ruin everything if we don't stop her.

157
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If you win to fear little Mai, I'll never forgive you.

158
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What, interfere? Me? Never.

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Look, let's just leave it up to Snork Maiden now, little Mai.

160
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You'll need me if Snork Maiden's not tender and understanding enough.

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Hey, Moomin.

162
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So, how is Snork Maiden getting on her, taking them for a stroll?

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Where are they?

164
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If we were narrow.

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Papa, if we get much closer.

166
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And the last thing we want is for them to see us.

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Looks like I'll have to go and talk to them, you're all too big.

168
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll come back later and tell you what they said.

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No, don't. You'll upset Snork Maiden.

170
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You're the one who's upsetting her.

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Shh!

172
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
All right. Can I ask you again about the suitcase?

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes.

174
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Does that suitcase belong to you or is it the groaks?

175
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
No.

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes!

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No.

178
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Let's try it another way.

179
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Who's is that suitcase?

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's yours, it's ours.

181
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But you told Moomin Mama that it wasn't yours.

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It was the groaks.

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yes, we did.

184
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Do you mind if I ask you one more time?

185
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Please do.

186
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Right, here we go.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Now, all I want is a simple yes or no.

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Is that suitcase yours or not?

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No, yes.

190
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, take your time, Snork Maiden.

191
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And don't rush them, he said.

192
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What was that, Snork Maiden?

193
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Look, I'm sorry, but can I ask you again?

194
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yes, as many times as you want.

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Thank you. This is the very last time, so please tell me the truth.

196
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Now then, the suitcase.

197
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yes.

198
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You know which one?

199
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes.

200
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Does it belong to you?

201
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes, it does.

202
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So it's not the groaks.

203
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes, it is not the groaks.

204
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
At last, we're getting somewhere, praise the booble.

205
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We're very happy for you.

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Snork Maiden is really having to work hard.

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I wouldn't have, I'd scare them into talking.

208
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You should have let me go.

209
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, but we wanted someone gentle.

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Snork Maiden is nice.

211
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Everybody in this house is nice.

212
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Do you think they'd let us stay here forever?

213
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Of course.

214
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
If we can keep away from the grog.

215
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It took a long time, but in the end they trusted me, and now we're good friends.

216
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Who wouldn't trust you and want to be good friends?

217
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Thank you.

218
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It wasn't easy, though. They kept speaking together and I got rather muddled.

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But they did tell me somehow.

220
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Rather muddled.

221
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I told you, guys, you should have let me do it.

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, I'm afraid I didn't get very much, though.

223
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I knew you wouldn't.

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So what did you find out then, Snork Maiden?

225
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Tell us.

226
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, first of all, the suitcase does seem to be theirs.

227
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That was one thing they made very clear.

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Then Hulk and the grog.

229
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Just a minute, Moomin.

230
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What's in the suitcase on the other hand belongs to the grog.

231
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's the problem.

232
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh, dear. So they do have something belonging to a...

233
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh.

234
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Well, Snork Maiden, what is it?

235
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
They wouldn't tell me what it is, little Mai.

236
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Only that it is the most beautiful thing in the world.

237
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh, is it?

238
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I wonder.

239
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
This is very difficult to understand.

240
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I mean, think of me and Bob don't look like thieves at all, do they?

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So, the grog just wanted back what is hers.

242
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't see how that big ugly monster could own the most beautiful thing in the world.

243
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Well, what they said was that she just happened to have it.

244
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
They didn't say whether it belonged to her or not.

245
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So she might have stolen it herself.

246
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
They shouldn't have taken it, though.

247
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Oh, dear, oh dear.

248
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Bob and Thingamy are very frightened of how she'll take her revenge if she catches them.

249
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But they're very determined to keep what's in the suitcase, Moomin, Papa.

250
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh, this is a fine mess indeed.

251
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The grog is sure to come back tonight.

252
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What can we do?

253
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What can we do?

254
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What can we do?

255
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We can do the same as before.

256
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah, but it's not fair to drive her away.

257
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
If what's in the suitcase really does belong to her?

258
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
She means to get the suitcase and I don't think it will be so easy to get rid of her this time.

259
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And if she stays, we'll have a never-ending winter.

260
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Well, I'll cover up the petunias just in case.

261
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Are you all going to stay here?

262
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'll look after Snork.

263
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I will, Moomin, Mama, I'll stay.

264
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You'll stay, won't you, Snuffkin?

265
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Don't look so clam, everyone.

266
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I've got an idea.

267
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But it would help if we knew what was in that suitcase.

268
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But even if we didn't, it could still work.

269
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What is it, dear?

270
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Just wait, Papa. You'll see.

271
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh!

272
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
She's coming!

273
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Are we?

274
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
She's not far away!

275
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh, I hope Moomin Papa can do something.

276
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's your girl, little mom.

277
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes, I know.

278
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
There's the king and the queen.

279
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Uh, this one.

280
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Uh-oh, she's coming.

281
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Just when I was winning.

282
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You better hide under the table, little my.

283
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Don't be stupid.

284
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
How can I hit her with my rolling pin from there?

285
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Where is she, Papa?

286
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Exactly where she was yesterday.

287
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'll go for a toast, alright, Papa?

288
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Let me go first and then the rest of you can fan out behind me.

289
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Moomin Mama.

290
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What is it, Papa?

291
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Perhaps now's the time to tell us your idea.

292
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
We haven't long.

293
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Wait, Grog.

294
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Don't go away.

295
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We want to talk to you.

296
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
We know that you've come back to get what thing of me and Bob took from you.

297
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That is right, isn't it, huh?

298
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Won't you let them keep it, perhaps?

299
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No, will you sell it to them?

300
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh, dear.

301
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I have some very beautiful things here in my bag.

302
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Maybe you'd like to trade, Grog.

303
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What about this pendant?

304
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Isn't it lovely?

305
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So you don't like that?

306
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What about this then?

307
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Or this?

308
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, alright.

309
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Why don't you choose?

310
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Take anything you want from my handbag, except the hair slide.

311
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Which one do you want, this one?

312
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Let me see with this.

313
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Oh, this one?

314
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Oh, dear.

315
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That's not really mine to give to you.

316
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Snork maiden gave that to a moment.

317
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Is it alright if I give the shell to her moment?

318
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You'll never allow.

319
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Are you alright?

320
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yes, my hand was suddenly frozen.

321
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
No, you've got the shell, Mrs. Grog.

322
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Do you promise not to come back anymore?

323
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Because I'll get you if you do.

324
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh, my God!

325
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, that was a close thing.

326
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm glad that's over.

327
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, you were marvelous, Mama.

328
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm so sorry, Moomin.

329
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I forgot that I had put your precious shell in my handbag to keep it safe.

330
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's alright, Mama.

331
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You gave it in a good cause.

332
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What Snork maiden gonna say, Moomin?

333
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I heard you.

334
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You said you'd never go to sleep without kissing it.

335
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Or something equally stupid.

336
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Well, I'm not gonna tell Snork maiden.

337
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But I think Mama did the right thing.

338
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
She'll find out.

339
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm fed up with secrets.

340
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm always gonna tell the truth from now on, no matter what.

341
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh!

342
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Moomin!

343
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Moomin!

344
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Look!

345
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I found one!

346
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Really?

347
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Well, it's very similar.

348
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But the one Snork maiden gave me was much bigger.

349
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh, a lot bigger, was it?

350
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Moomin had decided that he had to find a shell that was exactly the same as the one Snork maiden had given him.

351
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Then with luck, she would never find out what he'd done with it.

352
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh!

353
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
This is it!

354
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
This is it!

355
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I killed it!

356
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's exactly the same as the other one.

357
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Nothing short of a miracle, isn't it?

358
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But then in Moomin Valley, miracles do happen.

359
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.

360
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

361
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
They're always happy and always at play.

362
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

363
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:43,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.

364
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

365
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
They're always happy and always at play.

366
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

367
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The Moomin's.

368
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The Moomin's.
