00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you are your TV, there are the movements, there are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

00:36.000 --> 00:49.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:49.000 --> 00:59.000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

01:19.000 --> 01:29.000
There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

01:50.000 --> 01:59.000
With all the excitement of that night, sniffed decided not to go home and was sharing movement's bed.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Snuffkin, as always, preferred to sleep in his tent.

02:03.000 --> 02:11.000
You remember what happened, the horrible grok coming after thingamy and bob and everything freezing?

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
For a moment however, the night wasn't quite over yet.

02:18.000 --> 02:28.000
Lonely papa, help me, the grok is after me!

02:28.000 --> 02:38.000
I can't run anymore!

02:38.000 --> 02:58.000
Run anymore!

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Why am I on the floor?

03:01.000 --> 03:12.000
Sniff?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Morning Mama!

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Good morning Moomin, is sniff up yet?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
You're joking, where is thingamy and bob?

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
They haven't stirred yet, the poor things are tired out.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Papa's not still asleep is he?

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
No, he's looking at my rose bushes.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Are they okay papa?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
No, frozen to death and look.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
What?

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
That's where she was standing over there where the grass is dead.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
She must have been real cold to freeze the roses, what a shame, they were very pretty.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
There's not much left of them now, we'll have to grow some new ones.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I dreamed that she was chasing me papa.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Oh don't worry Moomin, I think she's only after thingamy and bob.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
So they're not fugitives from justice after all?

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
I have a feeling that they would prefer that moment.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Aren't thingamy and bob coming down?

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Yes, if they could have breakfast in their room if you didn't mind.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Well, what did they tell you?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
What?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
About why the groke is chasing them.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
Oh, they just looked terrified and wouldn't say anything about her at all.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
You know, we really ought to find out why.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Yes, you're right.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Moomin Mama, why don't you take their breakfast up and see if they'll tell you anything

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
if any of us can get it out of the meal can.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Who's that?

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
It's only me, I've brought you both a nice breakfast.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Come here.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Well, what did they say?

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
It seems that the groke is after the suitcase, not them.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I wonder what's in it, perhaps they've stolen her mummy as well.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
And they also said that it did use to belong to her.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Oh dear, if they've stolen it.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I don't know about that.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
I asked them how they got it, but they wouldn't say another word.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Well, this is too much.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
We could be harboring criminals.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
I know they don't look like it, but you never know, do you?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
You can ask the groke!

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Don't shout.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
No, that's no good.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
We don't want to come back here most definitely.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Let's ask the police inspector to question them.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
We don't want to get the police involved.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Well, you'll suggest something, Anne!

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
Quit shouting, sniff!

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
Look, why don't you just wait for them to tell you a moment?

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
I know it seems strange, but I've noticed that if you pretend not to be interested,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
people can't wait to tell you those secrets.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
They told Mama about the suitcase, but they wouldn't say anything to Papa.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
You know something, Moomin?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
They might open up to Snork Maiden.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
She's someone more their own age.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
You could be right.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Hey, Snork Maiden!

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Where are you going?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Moomin house.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
I'll come with you, but I thought you were living there.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I was until mumble came back yesterday.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
How is she?

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Bossy, and she snores, too.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Moomin!

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Snork Maiden!

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Where are you off to?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Well, I was just on my way to see you.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Oh, that's so nice, and I've come to see you, Moomin.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
I brought you a little present, Moomin.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
A present for me.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Yes, and it's very beautiful.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
What is it?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Something you must never break or lose.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I promise I won't.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
There you are.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Thank you.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Go on, open it.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
A lot of beautiful shell.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
I spent all of yesterday on the beach searching for it just for you.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Look, we can see ourselves in it.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
So we can.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Thank you very much, Snork Maiden.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
It's my heart, and I want you to look after me.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Oh, I will, Snork Maiden.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
I will.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I'll think of you whenever I look at it.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
I'm Moomin.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
I promise you that I'll always kiss the shell before I go to sleep.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
It will be my most precious treasure.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Apart from me?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
So what shall I do?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Take them for a walk?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Yes, but take your time, and don't rush them.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
I'll let them cry on my shoulder.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Yes, and try and talk to them as well, though.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
I feel very important, and a little bit nervous, too.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Have some tea first.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Thank you, Moomin, Mama.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Ah!

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
We don't need your help, Little My.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Ha, that's what you think.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I'd be able to weadle out their secrets.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
It's not an interrogation.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
We only want to talk to them, you know?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
So you can weadle out their secrets.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I'll be very quiet.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Little My, have you ever managed to be very quiet?

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Not really, but there's only one way to find out.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You must let me go with Snork Maiden.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
No, this situation needs a tender understanding, Moomin.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
That's me, exactly!

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
You ready?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
I suppose so.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Hello, it's Moomin.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Can I talk to you for a minute?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Hello?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
This is Snork Maiden.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
She's a very good friend of mine.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Hello, I'm very happy to meet you both.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
She's very tender and understanding,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
and she'd like to talk to you.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Can she come in?

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Well, if she has to, Moomin.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Come in, Maiden.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
You pee, you pee, you pee.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
It's very beautiful, a perfect heart shape.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
I've never seen anything like it, Moomin.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Would you like one, Mama?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
No, my dear.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
There should only be one shell like this.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Then would you keep it somewhere safe for me?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Well, self-kin.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
I'm sure Snork Maiden will get it out of him.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
I do hope so.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I think they like it anyway.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
I have a feeling in my bones that Groke will be back tonight.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
If we could find out why she's after them, we'd know what to do.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
Mama won't have any garden left if that monster comes back every night.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Moomin.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Well done, Snork Maiden.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Little Mai.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Oh no, she'll ruin everything if we don't stop her.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
If you win to fear little Mai, I'll never forgive you.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
What, interfere? Me? Never.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Look, let's just leave it up to Snork Maiden now, little Mai.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
You'll need me if Snork Maiden's not tender and understanding enough.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Hey, Moomin.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
So, how is Snork Maiden getting on her, taking them for a stroll?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Where are they?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
If we were narrow.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Papa, if we get much closer.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
And the last thing we want is for them to see us.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Looks like I'll have to go and talk to them, you're all too big.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I'll come back later and tell you what they said.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
No, don't. You'll upset Snork Maiden.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
You're the one who's upsetting her.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Shh!

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
All right. Can I ask you again about the suitcase?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Yes.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Does that suitcase belong to you or is it the groaks?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
No.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Yes!

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
No.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Let's try it another way.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Who's is that suitcase?

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
It's yours, it's ours.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
But you told Moomin Mama that it wasn't yours.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
It was the groaks.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Yes, we did.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
Do you mind if I ask you one more time?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Please do.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Right, here we go.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Now, all I want is a simple yes or no.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Is that suitcase yours or not?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
No, yes.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
Oh, take your time, Snork Maiden.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
And don't rush them, he said.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
What was that, Snork Maiden?

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Look, I'm sorry, but can I ask you again?

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Yes, as many times as you want.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Thank you. This is the very last time, so please tell me the truth.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Now then, the suitcase.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Yes.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
You know which one?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Yes.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Does it belong to you?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Yes, it does.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
So it's not the groaks.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Yes, it is not the groaks.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
At last, we're getting somewhere, praise the booble.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
We're very happy for you.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Snork Maiden is really having to work hard.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
I wouldn't have, I'd scare them into talking.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
You should have let me go.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, but we wanted someone gentle.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Snork Maiden is nice.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Everybody in this house is nice.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
Do you think they'd let us stay here forever?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Of course.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
If we can keep away from the grog.

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
It took a long time, but in the end they trusted me, and now we're good friends.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Who wouldn't trust you and want to be good friends?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Thank you.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
It wasn't easy, though. They kept speaking together and I got rather muddled.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
But they did tell me somehow.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Rather muddled.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
I told you, guys, you should have let me do it.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Oh, I'm afraid I didn't get very much, though.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I knew you wouldn't.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
So what did you find out then, Snork Maiden?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Tell us.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
Well, first of all, the suitcase does seem to be theirs.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
That was one thing they made very clear.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Then Hulk and the grog.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Just a minute, Moomin.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
What's in the suitcase on the other hand belongs to the grog.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
That's the problem.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
Oh, dear. So they do have something belonging to a...

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Oh.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Well, Snork Maiden, what is it?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
They wouldn't tell me what it is, little Mai.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Only that it is the most beautiful thing in the world.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Oh, is it?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I wonder.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
This is very difficult to understand.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
I mean, think of me and Bob don't look like thieves at all, do they?

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
So, the grog just wanted back what is hers.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
I don't see how that big ugly monster could own the most beautiful thing in the world.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
Well, what they said was that she just happened to have it.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
They didn't say whether it belonged to her or not.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
So she might have stolen it herself.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
They shouldn't have taken it, though.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Oh, dear, oh dear.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
Bob and Thingamy are very frightened of how she'll take her revenge if she catches them.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
But they're very determined to keep what's in the suitcase, Moomin, Papa.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Oh, this is a fine mess indeed.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
The grog is sure to come back tonight.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
What can we do?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
What can we do?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
What can we do?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
We can do the same as before.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Yeah, but it's not fair to drive her away.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
If what's in the suitcase really does belong to her?

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
She means to get the suitcase and I don't think it will be so easy to get rid of her this time.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
And if she stays, we'll have a never-ending winter.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
Well, I'll cover up the petunias just in case.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Are you all going to stay here?

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
I'll look after Snork.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I will, Moomin, Mama, I'll stay.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
You'll stay, won't you, Snuffkin?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Don't look so clam, everyone.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
I've got an idea.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
But it would help if we knew what was in that suitcase.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
But even if we didn't, it could still work.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
What is it, dear?

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Just wait, Papa. You'll see.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Oh!

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
She's coming!

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Are we?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
She's not far away!

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Oh, I hope Moomin Papa can do something.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
It's your girl, little mom.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Yes, I know.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
There's the king and the queen.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Uh, this one.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Uh-oh, she's coming.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Just when I was winning.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
You better hide under the table, little my.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Don't be stupid.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
How can I hit her with my rolling pin from there?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Where is she, Papa?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Exactly where she was yesterday.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I'll go for a toast, alright, Papa?

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Let me go first and then the rest of you can fan out behind me.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Moomin Mama.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
What is it, Papa?

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Perhaps now's the time to tell us your idea.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
We haven't long.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Wait, Grog.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Don't go away.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
We want to talk to you.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
We know that you've come back to get what thing of me and Bob took from you.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
That is right, isn't it, huh?

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Won't you let them keep it, perhaps?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
No, will you sell it to them?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Oh, dear.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
I have some very beautiful things here in my bag.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Maybe you'd like to trade, Grog.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
What about this pendant?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Isn't it lovely?

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
So you don't like that?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
What about this then?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Or this?

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Oh, alright.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Why don't you choose?

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
Take anything you want from my handbag, except the hair slide.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Which one do you want, this one?

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Let me see with this.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Oh, this one?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Oh, dear.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
That's not really mine to give to you.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Snork maiden gave that to a moment.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
Is it alright if I give the shell to her moment?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
You'll never allow.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Are you alright?

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Yes, my hand was suddenly frozen.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
No, you've got the shell, Mrs. Grog.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
Do you promise not to come back anymore?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Because I'll get you if you do.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Oh, my God!

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Well, that was a close thing.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I'm glad that's over.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Oh, you were marvelous, Mama.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I'm so sorry, Moomin.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
I forgot that I had put your precious shell in my handbag to keep it safe.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
It's alright, Mama.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
You gave it in a good cause.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
What Snork maiden gonna say, Moomin?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
I heard you.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
You said you'd never go to sleep without kissing it.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Or something equally stupid.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Well, I'm not gonna tell Snork maiden.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
But I think Mama did the right thing.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
She'll find out.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I'm fed up with secrets.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
I'm always gonna tell the truth from now on, no matter what.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Oh!

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Moomin!

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Moomin!

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Look!

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
I found one!

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Really?

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Well, it's very similar.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
But the one Snork maiden gave me was much bigger.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Oh, a lot bigger, was it?

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
Moomin had decided that he had to find a shell that was exactly the same as the one Snork maiden had given him.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Then with luck, she would never find out what he'd done with it.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Oh!

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
This is it!

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
This is it!

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I killed it!

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
It's exactly the same as the other one.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Nothing short of a miracle, isn't it?

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
But then in Moomin Valley, miracles do happen.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.

22:14.000 --> 22:22.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
They're always happy and always at play.

22:26.000 --> 22:33.000
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

22:33.000 --> 22:43.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.

22:43.000 --> 22:51.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
They're always happy and always at play.

22:55.000 --> 23:02.000
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
The Moomin's.

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
The Moomin's.
