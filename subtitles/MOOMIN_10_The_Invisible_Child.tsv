404160	408160	No! I'd like to know where Ninny's hiding!
411160	413160	Oh, look!
413160	415160	Oh!
418160	425160	That! Come out, Nanny. I've got you. That was a good place. But I saw your ribbon.
425160	431160	Oh! Now for snorkemaiden. She's always easy to find.
434160	437160	Ha! That's only because she wants to be found!
437160	440160	Found you snorkemaiden!
440160	442160	Waaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn,
442160	454160	Two, three, don't wait, nanny, this is my boy.
456160	459160	Four.
463160	466160	Hey, nanny, I'll show you a good place.
466160	468160	Just come with your uncle stinky.
472160	484160	Now don't worry, no one will find you there, it opens up once you're inside.
484160	487160	Come on, it's a bit steep, I'll help you.
488160	491160	Oh, stop!
501160	503160	Right, that should keep you quiet.
503160	505160	You're a bit too visible at the moment.
505160	506160	Oh, let me out.
506160	510160	But I'm sure if you stay here until tomorrow, no one will see it all.
510160	514160	Please don't leave me here, please.
514160	516160	No, it's...
524160	527160	That's it, now tomorrow we'll hit the bank.
536160	538160	Let me out.
538160	540160	Please let me out.
541160	545160	I'm very glad I thought of bringing nanny here.
545160	547160	It's nice to have her here too, Tiki.
547160	549160	She's no trouble at all.
549160	554160	You're all pretty eccentric, and it might be just what she needs to make her want to be seen again.
554160	557160	Oh, and you're very kind, of course.
557160	561160	Well, thank you, I think I suppose we should be flattered, shouldn't we?
561160	563160	Oh, yes, definitely.
563160	566160	She started to talk, but her voice is very weak.
566160	568160	You have to listen very carefully.
569160	572160	Has it always been like that, or just since she was invisible?
572160	575160	I'm not sure, I don't think it was like that before.
575160	580160	Lots of people manage very well without using their heads, so I'm certain nanny will be all right.
580160	583160	Yes, and I'm glad she's got movement in the others to play with.
583160	586160	She's never had anybody before, you know.
586160	589160	I think she'd find it a bit difficult to Tiki.
589160	593160	Well, Mum and Mama, I think that all she needs is something to shock her out of it.
593160	595160	Huh, got you a little, my.
596160	599160	Oh, that bush was too prickly anyway.
599160	601160	I expect I'm the last one, hey.
601160	603160	No, I haven't found nanny yet.
603160	604160	Nanny?
604160	606160	I didn't think nanny would hide so well.
606160	608160	Any luck, Sniff?
608160	610160	There's nowhere else to look, Mum and.
610160	613160	Perhaps she's lost or fallen or hurt herself.
613160	616160	I've looked absolutely everywhere.
616160	618160	I bet she's invisible again.
618160	620160	That's why I can't find her.
620160	622160	I bet Sniff hasn't looked everywhere.
622160	624160	She can't be far.
624160	626160	Do you know where she is, Mum?
626160	628160	No, I haven't seen her at all.
628160	631160	Not since we started.
631160	632160	Nanny!
632160	634160	Come on, we're going home.
634160	636160	We've finished playing.
636160	637160	Nanny!
637160	639160	Oh, my goodness, where could she be?
639160	640160	Nanny!
640160	642160	It's your turn, Sniff, so you've got to find her.
642160	643160	Nanny!
643160	645160	Not once the game's over, I haven't.
645160	646160	Never mind.
646160	647160	We'll all look.
647160	648160	We must find her.
648160	652160	We are supposed to be looking after her, you know?
653160	655160	Oh, come on, Nanny!
655160	657160	The game's over, we've finished!
657160	658160	Nanny!
658160	659160	Nanny!
659160	660160	Nanny!
660160	661160	Hurry up!
661160	663160	We're going home for cookies and lemonade!
663160	664160	Nanny!
664160	665160	Nanny!
679160	680160	Nanny!
680160	681160	Nanny!
681160	682160	Nanny!
682160	684160	Can you hear us?
684160	687160	We weren't supposed to come this far, Snort Maiden.
687160	691160	She might be really lost or frightened or anything.
691160	692160	Nanny!
692160	694160	Where are you, Nanny?
694160	695160	Can you hear me?
695160	696160	Nanny!
698160	699160	Help!
699160	700160	I'm over here!
700160	703160	Did you hear something?
703160	705160	I'm not sure.
705160	706160	Help!
706160	707160	Help!
707160	708160	I'm here!
708160	709160	Help!
710160	711160	That's her!
711160	712160	She's not far away!
712160	713160	Nanny!
713160	715160	Where are you?
715160	716160	Here!
716160	718160	Behind this rock!
718160	720160	Where's her voice coming from?
720160	722160	That way, I think.
722160	723160	Nanny!
723160	725160	I can't hear what you're saying!
725160	727160	Try and shout a bit louder!
727160	729160	I'm over here!
729160	730160	Over here!
730160	732160	Behind the rock!
732160	734160	I still can't hear her properly!
734160	735160	Louder, Nanny!
735160	736160	Louder!
736160	738160	Behind the rock!
738160	740160	Which rock?
740160	741160	Over here!
741160	743160	The big rock!
745160	747160	Over there!
747160	751160	I've never shouted so much in my life!
751160	753160	Nanny!
753160	756160	Nanny, are you behind this rock, Nanny?
756160	757160	Yes!
757160	759160	Stinky block the cave with it!
759160	761160	Don't worry, we'll get you out!
761160	763160	Hang on!
769160	771160	Are you alright, Nanny?
771160	772160	Thank you, Mum!
772160	774160	Oh, thank you!
775160	777160	Your voice seems to be...
777160	778160	Oh, what?
778160	780160	Oh, nothing!
780160	783160	Try and hold on to me, and I'll call you out!
783160	785160	Oh, thank you!
791160	792160	Hey!
792160	793160	What's happened?
793160	794160	Where's your finder?
794160	795160	In the cave!
795160	796160	Wow!
796160	799160	What a brilliant hiding place had you find it!
802160	803160	What's wrong?
803160	805160	Did I say something funny?
807160	810160	Now, that was very mean of Stinky's.
810160	813160	A clever idea, though, of interuser for a van robbery.
813160	814160	Oh, Papa!
814160	816160	Oh, I know Stinky shouldn't have done it,
816160	820160	and it must have been a nasty shopping trapped in the dark in that cave,
820160	823160	but no real harm came to her, and she didn't disappear,
823160	825160	and her voice got much stronger.
825160	826160	You're so loud!
826160	828160	Oh, goodness! Did you, dear?
828160	830160	Yes, Mum and Mama!
830160	834160	Mum told me to yell loudly, so he'd know where I was!
834160	836160	And it was loud, too!
836160	838160	Good for you, Nanny.
838160	840160	It's surprising the things you can do if you have to,
840160	845160	and you ought to remember that people who speak loudly are usually very noticeable.
846160	848160	Go on, yo! I want to see it!
848160	850160	That's a good idea, Nanny.
850160	852160	If shouting brought back your voice,
852160	854160	you never know it might be just what's needed to make the rest of you.
855160	857160	Try and get angry, as well.
857160	860160	Yeah, that's easy. Just think about Stinky.
860160	862160	Yeah, and how horrible he is!
862160	865160	That should make you angry. Very angry!
868160	870160	Just your white Stinky!
870160	872160	I can't help faster than me!
875160	877160	Stinky, wait! We want to talk to you!
877160	879160	I don't want to talk to you!
880160	882160	Help! Help!
882160	884160	Are you all right, Sniff?
886160	888160	You can't get away, Stinky.
889160	892160	The forest is my home ground! You won't catch me in here!
899160	902160	Hold it.
902160	904160	You can't do this to me!
904160	906160	We're only doing what you did to Nanny.
906160	909160	Now look, I needed her to help me. I did, I tell ya.
909160	912160	But she didn't want to, huh?
912160	915160	That's why I put her down this hole to change her mind.
915160	919160	And scare her so much that she'd become totally invisible again.
919160	923160	She had to be invisible for my plan. Now get me out of here!
923160	926160	It's all right, Stinky. See you tomorrow!
926160	928160	No! No!
936160	939160	You crushed few things!
939160	942160	I had such a wonderful plan!
942160	945160	Ah, you're spiteful!
945160	948160	Let's hear them my next job!
948160	953160	But despite all that had happened, Nanny's face was still not to be seen.
956160	959160	Then, about ten days later.
969160	972160	This weather seems to push the nails out.
974160	977160	I haven't seen anyone stare at the sea like Nanny does.
977160	980160	Well, maybe she's never seen it before.
980160	988160	Oh, she's crying now!
1003160	1005160	What's the matter?
1005160	1008160	It's the sea! It's far too big!
1008160	1011160	You don't have to go on it, you know.
1013160	1016160	Mama! Mama! What's up?
1020160	1022160	What's the matter with her?
1022160	1027160	Nothing to worry about. She's never seen the sea before and she's just surprised at how big it is.
1030160	1034160	Well, there's an awful lot of water, that's for sure.
1039160	1044160	Nanny's lucky. I wish there was something to surprise or excite me.
1044160	1047160	Nothing's happened for weeks. Anything would be nice.
1047160	1049160	Mama must be bored.
1049160	1051160	I think you're right.
1051160	1052160	But she never gets bored.
1052160	1055160	Well, she is now. She needs something to happen.
1055160	1058160	I think we should do something to surprise her.
1058160	1060160	Like what?
1060160	1062160	Well, I know what we can do.
1062160	1063160	Well, tell me!
1063160	1066160	We'll creep up behind her and just give her a little push.
1067160	1069160	What, Papa? Push her into the sea?
1069160	1072160	Oh, Papa, you can't. Mama wouldn't like it.
1072160	1073160	Just watch me.
1073160	1076160	But the water's freezing. A mama will get all wet.
1076160	1079160	We never found the water too cold when we were your age.
1079160	1081160	You young people today have no sense of fun.
1081160	1083160	Did you really used to do things like that?
1083160	1085160	All the time.
1085160	1086160	Papa?
1086160	1087160	Yes, Mumann.
1087160	1088160	Oh, nothing.
1088160	1090160	Don't worry, Mumann.
1090160	1094160	It's always a prank. She'll find it very funny. I promise.
1095160	1096160	Oh.
1117160	1119160	I know you don't!
1120160	1122160	No!
1128160	1131160	Don't you dare push her into that big horrible sea.
1131160	1132160	Let me explain to you.
1132160	1134160	There's nothing to explain.
1134160	1137160	You're a big bully. She'd have gone all wet.
1137160	1139160	What a nasty trick.
1139160	1141160	You could never...
1150160	1152160	Nihini.
1158160	1161160	There's her face! Hurry!
1161160	1165160	That must be the sea.
1167160	1170160	What on earth happened? Were you up to something?
1170160	1176160	Oh, nothing much. You know that child has got the sharpest teeth with her without her head.
1177160	1180160	Oh, Mumann. Mumann, at last I'm visible again.
1180160	1182160	For always you won't disappear again.
1182160	1184160	Never, never.
1184160	1185160	Brave girl.
1185160	1187160	And with a good strong set of healthy teeth too.
1187160	1190160	Oh, I'm so happy, Nihini.
1190160	1192160	Mimi dear.
1193160	1194160	Mumann mother.
1194160	1196160	I'm very glad too.
1200160	1202160	Oh.
1202160	1204160	Oh.
1204160	1206160	Oh.
1208160	1210160	Oh.
1211160	1213160	Oh.
1217160	1219160	Oh, you.
1220160	1225160	Stop laughing, you horrible child. You used Sartuth monster.
1229160	1231160	What's so funny, huh?
1235160	1237160	Oh.
1252160	1254160	Really, Nihini laughed.
1254160	1257160	Well, she certainly changed, Mumann, Mama.
1257160	1260160	All she needed was to get angry and she did.
1261160	1263160	I hope Mumann Papa's forgiven, Nihini.
1263160	1266160	Thank you all for taking such good care of her.
1266160	1269160	I hate to say it, but she sounds almost as bad as it'll mine out.
1271160	1274160	Tiki! Nihini!
1279160	1282160	And so Nihini left Mumann house with Tiki.
1282160	1286160	Now that she was completely visible and far from Timid,
1286160	1288160	she was ready for anything.
1288160	1291160	That is except seeing her aunt, she said.
1310160	1312160	Boom!
1319160	1321160	Boom!
