    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're here for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They are the movements.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, what do you think?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.640
I'm going to say that I'm not going to say that. I'm going to say that I'm not going to say that. with me, they're for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:37.280
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:50.000
like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there was the movement, There was the movement, there was the movement,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
There was the movement, there was the movement,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:12.000
There was the movement, Snowton made him was in a very good mood because that day she was off to collect shells

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
of the seizure with Moon.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Moon!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Hey look, the sun's up and there's Gracie.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Oh, Drak.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What's the matter, Papa?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Oh, it's you, moment.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
What are you doing?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I heard you talking to yourself just now.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Huh?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Oh.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You see this? I'm writing a play. I heard you talking to yourself just now. Huh? Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You see this? I'm writing a play.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Writing a play?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You remember the last children?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
That was a very successful play.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Just now I was repeating a line.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Hey, look! Another beautiful day!

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And there goes Gracie.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's a wonderful line, of course.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Don't you agree?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It could be improved.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I think about it.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Tee-hee-hee!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Oh, man, look at this!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.240
Beautiful! Oh, man, look at this! Beautiful. Hey!

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.719
You find anything?

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.919
No, just usual old stuff.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.879
Oh, there's another big one.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.120
Can't you really find anything, moment?

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.199
I'll look somewhere else.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.800
I still think this is the best place.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800
Well, I'm going over there.

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.199
And you're so beautiful.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.599
Oh.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.599
What are you doing, movement?

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.199
I...

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.000
Now that's no shell surely. No.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So why did you dig it out?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Well, once you see it, you won't find out what it is.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
A very odd thing, isn't it?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Not very interesting.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Oh no, I can see what it is.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.599
I gave it a good wash.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.759
I've seen one just like in the fairy tales.

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:29.080
It's an old lamb.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.280
Yes, you remember the story called a maddit?

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.039
He rubbed the lamb and the genie appeared.

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:38.000
The genie might appear for us if we do what Aladdin did.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.479
Don't be silly, Snork Maiden.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:41.759
Hmm.

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:43.000
Hmm.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:04:08.000
But Snork Maiden, that was a fairy tale. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm And I'm sure you have to say some magic words, such as, apricot dapura, spirit come forth, apricot dapura,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
try for all your worth.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
You've chosen the wrong words.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
You should say, come out, say some of your something.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Huh?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness!

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Keep going, Stormy-dark!

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Ah! I am the spirit of the land. What is your command?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Goodness, did you come out of this lamp?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
You got it.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So you really are the spirit of this lamp?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Always have been.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
But I have the book and you're not him.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I can prove it if you're quite sure you want me to.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
By all means, it probably wasn't a good picture.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I'm the one and only spirit of the lamp.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Then you must have the power to make any wish come true, is that so?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Her wish, certainly, but not yours.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
But I'm the one who'll dug you out.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
That's not so important, kid.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
She's the one who summoned me forth from the lamp.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
What are we gonna do about this spirit?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Why? Ask for something. Ask for something you've always wanted.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Uh, let's see. A pearl necklace.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Soight, now your wish is my command. You always wanted. Uh, let's see. A pearl necklace.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Soight me, your wishes, my command.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Hey, wait a minute.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Oh. A pearl necklace is only one of the things I wanted I hadn't decided yet.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Don't worry, Snorkmaidum. I guess you can always send it back.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
If I like the necklace, then it's your turn to rub the lamp.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Then you can wish for whatever you've always wanted. Yes, but where exactly did you rub the lamp?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.480
Right here and very, very slowly.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.759
All right, I'll say spirit come forth.

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.160
It sounds a little better than come out spirit.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.000
Oh!

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Oh!

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.800
Oh, nice.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.000
What was that? Oh, it's back.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
One oil necklace, Miss. Thanks.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
This is incredible.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Right, I do think this is exactly what I wanted.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Oh, thank you ever so much.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
All in a day's wake.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So pleased to oblige, Miss.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Are you going to be able to do this? Oh, thank you ever so much. All in a day's wake. So pleased to oblige, Miss.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Are you going back into the lab?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Yes, I am.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I'm so happy. Now it's my turn to let you out of here.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I'd like to have a wish granted too, please.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Now, wait a minute.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
If getting in and out is a bother, why don't you let me give you my wish right now?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Can't do it, young man. One at a time in the face to call. If getting in and out is a bother, why don't you let me give you my wish right now?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Can't do it, young man, one at a time in the face to call.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Just one at a safe time.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Impossible, young-said.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
But why?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Because I am only able to fulfill one wish a week.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I need my rest. It's hard working though.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Oh well, of course it's tiring.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Perhaps I expected too much from you. Hold on, I wouldn't like you to think that I haven't got the power.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.399
I can do many extraordinary things.

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:11.399
What kind of things?

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:12.399
Not telling you.

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:22.800
Listen, moment, we won't tell a soul about this lamp, all right?

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.199
Of course not. Pee-hee-hee-hee-hee.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:06.000
No! Names don't really matter. Tulip Hydrangea, who cares? No, that's not right yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Oh, yeah.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Oh, yeah.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Oh, yeah.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Oh, yeah.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Oh, yeah.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Oh, yeah.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Oh, yeah.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Oh, yeah.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Oh, yeah.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Hmm. Praise the lad and I didn't tell them I can get out at night.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I'd have no peace at all.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
My leisure time would be totally ruined by these two.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Good thing also I can read their minds so I know what I'm up against.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:58.799
They're up to something I know they are. Oh yes, dear me, dear me. No wonder the young man is worried to death. She wish I better

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:05.000
rewrite this. Oh Edgur Edgur, I do wish you were somebody else.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
This will certainly have to be changed.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
The whole page, really.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
What's going on here? Who did this?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Mum, not you surely. What?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And some rascals been rewriting my play.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Who could that possibly be?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Who indeed in the middle of the night while I was asleep.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
It's very strange, isn't it, Papa?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It can't be you, Mum, can it?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.720
Of course not, Papa.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.919
I am upset.

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:48.279
Who can it be?

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:51.320
Imagine going into your study while you were fast asleep.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.039
It's very rude, isn't it?

00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:56.799
I find it incredible that anyone could do such a thing.

00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:58.840
And all the rewriting was done on those bits

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.120
that I knew weren't perfectly polished.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.679
Listen, dear, I'm sure they were far too good for him

00:10:03.679 --> 00:10:10.000
to improve on. No, no, you're wrong. That's the worst thing. I must admit he did improve them.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Then I think you should feel pleased, dear.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Yes. No, I'm not a bit pleased. A dramatist should write his own plays.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Looks great, Snork Maiden. That is, if you like necklaces.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Thank you, little Maya, it was given to me as a present.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Rather nice. Would you mind if I tried it on for a minute?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Of course not. I'm sure you'll look gorgeous.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I suppose in time one could get to like necklaces.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I could ask for a similar one for you.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Deepers, who's your rich friend?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Yes. I searched the whole house, but I can't find it anywhere.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Someone must have stolen it.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Don't worry, Mrs. Philly-Junk. I fully expect to arrest the thief any minute now.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Good afternoon, Inspector.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Hello, Snort Maiden.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Please, hurry, Inspector.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
The thief has almost certainly left Moomin Valley already.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.799
Oh, dear, oh, dear. nothing is safe in this valley anymore.

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:07.879
Now calm down, Mrs. Philly jog.

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:11.200
Did you just say you've had something stolen, Mrs. Philly jog?

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.639
My pearl necklace, extraordinarily beautiful pearls,

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:16.039
87 of them.

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:19.200
Looks just like the one you're wearing, little my.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.039
You stole it.

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:23.399
Did you?

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:24.399
Hmm?

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:26.000
Oh, oh knew you!

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
What are you doing?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Stop!

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Get off the doctor!

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Arrest your old brother!

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
She's a baby!

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
She's innocent!

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Little Maya, please!

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
The smallest creature up in the most cunning and generous world!

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
This is Snarkman's necklace, you know.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Huh?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
That's very funny, little Maya!

00:11:44.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Is that the best explanation you can think of? No one calls Little Maya thief and gets away with it! It means necklace you know. That's a lie! They stole it Inspector! I've never known them to lie before Mrs. Philly John.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
From a very bad background! You should see their home!

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
So right! I'm gonna see a photo of you!

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Stop it, little man!

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Bad background and you don't tell me that you say that!

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Remember, there's something I want to ask you, little man!

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
What are you doing?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:32.000
The more I have to do a page, you know.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
This is it.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I love to know who did this. He's sitting there going to act with words.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Listen to this. This is a good example.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Hey, look at the sky, the sun's up and there's Gracie.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
That's not great, sounds very ordinary.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
That's what I wrote, Snuffkin.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
That's all right.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Now listen to how he rewrote it.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.240
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks,

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.600
it is the east and Juliet is the sun, a rise,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.480
fair sun, and kill the envious moon

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.720
who is already sick and pale with grief.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.919
Bleh!

00:13:15.919 --> 00:13:17.519
What a sunrise!

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:19.679
And note how clever this writer is to change

00:13:19.679 --> 00:13:21.919
her name from Gracie to Juliet.

00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:24.399
Oh, Gracie's worried because a parents

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:26.500
don't approve of her love Edgar.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.539
I had his names don't matter,

00:13:28.539 --> 00:13:30.940
to you lipid ranges who cares.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.340
But listen to this.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.620
What's in a name?

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.980
That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.080
Much more romantic.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.019
I got a show on your wood.

00:13:42.019 --> 00:13:43.779
What a notheromial cold.

00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:45.200
Oh, it's simply great. Except maybe I wouldn't have on your wood. Well, he knocked a Romeo called. Oh, it's simply great.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.700
Except maybe I wouldn't have mentioned his smell.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.500
Don't you agree, he's an excellent playwright.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.500
Yes, I agree.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.899
He sounds like a very promising playwright.

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:57.299
And then wordy, perhaps, but really good.

00:13:57.299 --> 00:13:59.200
Very good indeed.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.000
Write him a note asking him to carry on.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.600
And there might not be necessary.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.899
You know, all the changes were made in the middle of the night

00:14:05.899 --> 00:14:07.700
while I was fast asleep,

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.500
and usually writers are in their beds

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.000
none of their desks when they're asleep.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.700
Well, yes, that's the only time you're not at your desk, isn't it?

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.700
But there are people you know who walk about at night

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.299
without remembering about it the next morning.

00:14:22.299 --> 00:14:24.000
Sleepwalkers, you mean?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.919
Now I come to think of it, you were rather sleepy

00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:28.240
when you woke up this morning.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.879
You're right, Mum and Mama,

00:14:29.879 --> 00:14:33.000
even sleepier than usual, just so.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.240
You mean you yourself got up at night

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.240
and then went and rewrote the play and you sleep?

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.200
Well, yes, I have been worried about some minor things

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.399
in my play, so my subconsciousness, fairly rich and literary talent,

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:49.600
as we all know, comes to the rescue.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.720
A moment, Papa.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.320
And in my sleep, my imagination runs riot.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.240
I have all sorts of good ideas that make me grab a pen

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.759
in the middle of the night and rush to my room

00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:01.200
to let the real skill throw.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.000
Got it. I got it! I got it!

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
With this I can have anything! I can do anything!

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Get me!

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Stop!

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
When I say stop, you have to stop!

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
He's back dirty!

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
I can be a pun on him.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
We've arrived when he won't get lost!

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Get lost yourself! I my dope time for you.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
The inspector's chasing me.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
What you?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Stop the little boy on the inspector.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
You have to stop the day's old.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
He's not teaching me them.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Don't deny it.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I know why you're running.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
You stole that thing, didn't you?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I know it's true.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
That's from a pure business.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
It's not yours.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.759
But it must be somebody so make it my business. It's not yours. But it must be somebody, so make it my business.

00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:47.240
Get it to me.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.919
Or a sacrifice.

00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:52.080
Please stop me from sending it. Give it back to me.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.279
Oh, no.

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:56.279
Hey, that folks like the lamp we found.

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:59.879
And chase him and specks it up, me.

00:15:59.879 --> 00:16:01.240
Hello?

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.360
Well, man, Stinky's got our magic lamp right after him!

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.440
Yes, we can't let him get away with it or terrible things might happen.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.600
Did you hear that, Snuffkin?

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.080
He said magic lamp or something.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.600
After lamp!

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.799
The magic lamp is mine, just leave me alone!

00:16:18.799 --> 00:16:46.000
Well, you guys, Stinky, help me get the necklace! Oh! You're the spirit of the lamp, aren't you? Yes, my master. What is your wish?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
You his master?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Yes, me! I'm the master. I let him out, so he'll do what I say.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I don't believe a word of this fairy tale's untrue.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Maybe it isn't true, but it works.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
I saw Snorkmaiden wishing for a pearl necklace and her wish was granted.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Uh-huh. So you're a star? Maybe it isn't true, but it works. I saw Snork maiden wishing for a pearl necklace

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
and her wish was granted.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Uh-huh, so you're responsible.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Yeah, and I brought it right away.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Now let me see.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
What do I want more than anything in the world?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Stinky, he can only make one wish a week come true.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
You'll have to wait your turn.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
No, that's very unfair.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Let's get back to the necklace. Where did you steal it from, Mr?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
I don't steal.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Well then tell me where you found it.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Around here somewhere.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Mrs. Philly John's house, baby.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I don't know who lives there.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Oh, then you did steal the necklace.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Well, that's a lot easier, you know.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
How about a magic key that can open anything,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
bolts and safes and stuff, huh?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Listen, there's something I'd like to ask you.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
A sack of gold wouldn't be half as much fun as a key that opens anything.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Tell me, is it possible that you rewrote Woman Popus Play?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Yes, I did. It was really awful.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Oh, come on, now I just needed some polishing.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And what's more, see this young man standing here?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Well, he was really worried about your play, you know?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
I was just trying to help.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Is this true?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Yeah, safer than burglary, of course.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
But then there's professional pride to think of.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I can explain, Papa. I saw you weren't happy about your play,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
and I wanted it to be a big success.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Of course, I didn't want the spirit to write it himself. But I saw you weren't happy about your play, and I wanted it to be a big success.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Of course, I didn't want the spirit to write it himself.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I'm gonna take the key!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I've just realized everybody, the spirit didn't write all that himself.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I've heard it before. I thought it sounded familiar.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Really, is that so?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Yes, he stole it from a play by somebody else.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.440
This spirit is a cheat and a liar.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.680
Oh, damn you.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.680
Well, I can't help being so well read.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.079
Can I go back in the lamp now?

00:18:51.079 --> 00:18:51.680
No!

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.079
Wait!

00:18:52.079 --> 00:18:53.079
Don't forget, though!

00:18:53.079 --> 00:18:55.079
I want next week's list now!

00:18:55.079 --> 00:18:56.839
Sorry, Master Canabline.

00:18:56.839 --> 00:18:59.400
Have them put into an impossible situation.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.559
See you next week!

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.000
But that's ridiculous.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Not next week, nor next month, or even next year.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Stinky, this lamp is not yours.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Besides, I know exactly the sort of thing you'd ask for,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
a master key or something.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Ha!

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Ha! You think you can hide that magic lamp from me, do you?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Well, there's no hiding place good enough for that.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Hmm. No, man, I really do think that lamp is a bit too dangerous to have. You're not going to get left for me, do you? Well, there's no hiding place good enough for that.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Hmm.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Well, then I really do think that lamp is a bit too dangerous to have a rod.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Hmm. I think you're right.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Snuffkin, do you have any good ideas for us? We can summon the spirit again.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
There's the inspector!

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
You do it, Snuffkin.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
I'll be back.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
I'll be back. There's the inspector!

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
You do it, Snuffkin! Cold the spirit!

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Oh, no, not again! What do you want this time?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Can you bring the hobgoblin here?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
I suppose so. I'll be back as soon as I can.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
But why on earth do you want the hobgoblin?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
As far as I can see, there's only one safe place for the lap where no one can find it.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
And that's on another planet, and the only one safe place for the lamp where no one can find it.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And that's on another planet, and the only one who can put it there is the Hobgoblin.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
He's coming any minute!

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Geez, that guy ever hard to find!

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Thank you.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
I've done my wake for this week. See you next week.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Goodbye! And some of the hard-gun took the magic ram away and hid it on some unknown planet.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:47.000
And a good thing too, it would really be very boring if all your wishes were granted, wouldn't it? We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
They're always happy and goes at play

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
The Moons are having fun day after day, the Moons

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
The Moons

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
The Moons.
