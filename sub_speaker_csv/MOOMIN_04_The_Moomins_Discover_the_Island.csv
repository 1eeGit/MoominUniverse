481000,483000,"So then, what's your excuse?",481000,485800,"SPEAKER_02"
483000,485000,"It's not easy rowing against the tide.",481000,485800,"SPEAKER_02"
485000,487000,"You try it.",481000,485800,"SPEAKER_02"
487000,491000,"No, dear, at this rate, I should be lucky to find one rare plant.",486600,490700,"SPEAKER_03"
491000,495000,"Well, Mr. Hamlin, you could always try collecting some seaweed instead.",491000,496000,"SPEAKER_05"
495000,497000,"There's plenty of that.",491000,496000,"SPEAKER_05"

576000,578000,"Hmm, I suppose you're right. This will come in handy.",564400,564900,"SPEAKER_02"
578000,582000,"As I said, Papa, it's always better to rough it with a little bit of luxury.",576200,578900,"SPEAKER_10"
582000,586000,"I wonder if we're the first to set foot on the island.",581900,584800,"SPEAKER_10"
588000,590000,"Thank you, children.",581900,584800,"SPEAKER_10"

602000,605000,"Mama, you said we needed firewood. Is this enough?",597000,603000,"SPEAKER_02"
605000,607000,"My goodness for a lot.",603100,606200,"SPEAKER_05"
612000,615000,"You know, I don't think anyone lives on this island.",606200,607600,"SPEAKER_02"
615000,619000,"I haven't seen anyone unless they're hiding in the bushes.",612300,615100,"SPEAKER_02"
619000,621000,"I've seen someone.",615500,618800,"SPEAKER_09"
621000,623000,"Oh, yeah? Who?",619600,621100,"SPEAKER_05"
623000,625000,"Well, they weren't very big.",621300,626000,"SPEAKER_05"

627000,629000,"Well, same as me.",626100,627400,"SPEAKER_05"
629000,631000,"What did they look like?",628200,638900,"SPEAKER_02"
631000,633000,"Sort of white and ghostly and not very friendly looking either, Moomin.",628200,638900,"SPEAKER_02"
633000,637000,"Well, you probably just thought you saw something a little, Maiden.",628200,638900,"SPEAKER_02"
637000,639000,"I did see them. I did too.",628200,638900,"SPEAKER_02"

703000,706000,"Well, what's this? Goodness, it's a perimeter.",703000,708300,"SPEAKER_03"
706000,711000,"Now, let's see. Rain and storm. Probably broken.",703000,708300,"SPEAKER_03"
718000,721000,"Oh, hello. Who are you?",708700,709900,"SPEAKER_03"

745000,749000,"No, they look kind of like it, but they're really harmless enough.",743100,745000,"SPEAKER_02"
749000,752000,"Oh, leave me alone.",745600,749300,"SPEAKER_09"
752000,754000,"Oh, dear. What on earth was that?",745600,749300,"SPEAKER_09"
