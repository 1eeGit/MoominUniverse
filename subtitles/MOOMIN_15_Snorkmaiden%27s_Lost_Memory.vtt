00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come. Come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you are your TV. They are the movements. They are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
So come with me. Give me your hand. I'll take you up to a movement land.

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
You can fly just like a bird. Sing that song ever. There were the movements.

00:43.000 --> 00:58.000
There were the movements. There were the movements. There were the movements.

01:13.000 --> 01:33.000
There were the movements. There were the movements.

01:33.000 --> 01:48.000
For a whole week, snorkemaiden had been curled up on the sofa, reading fairy tales.

01:48.000 --> 01:59.000
It's a lovely day and at last, movement is persuaded to come out for a walk in the lonely mountains.

01:59.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh, it's beautiful up here. Aren't you glad you came now? This is much better than fairy tales, isn't it snorkemaiden?

02:10.000 --> 02:21.000
Oh, look, movement. It's Adelvice. No, it isn't. That doesn't grow here at all.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm sure it is. I know what it looks like. I'm sorry, but it's not.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
Oh, it's just like in Heidi. No, it's not. It's just a daisy. Oh, come on. I want to pick it.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
Oh, no, it's too dangerous. I know then. You can do it. You're my boyfriend, aren't you, movement?

02:43.000 --> 02:51.000
Well, I suppose we could climb down there, but I promise you it's not Adelvice. That only grows in the Alps and there are hundreds of miles away.

02:51.000 --> 03:09.000
I know it's Adelvice. Be careful. They don't care about danger in fairy tales. That's why they call them fairy tales, silly.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Fairy Princess, please accept this, my humble offering.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
Thank you, Brave Knight. You are right, movement. This isn't Adelvice. See, I told you...

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
It's gonna be hard to get down from here, you know? Can't we go back the way we came?

03:25.000 --> 03:33.000
Well, I think it'll be easier to try to get to that path. If you say so...

03:34.000 --> 03:42.000
It's nearer anyway, and better than going up. I'm surprised you're such a good climber.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, Royalty is good at practically everything.

03:45.000 --> 04:00.000
It's not made of. It's not made of.

04:00.000 --> 04:09.000
It's not made of.

04:09.000 --> 04:24.000
Let me see six petals. What was that, a giant snowball? It can't be, it isn't winter.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
Well, nothing of interest to me. Now, where was I?

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
We start hemulating. Has Snorkmaiden just gone past you?

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
Snorkmaiden, no, I've seen going past. It's a very large snowball.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
That was Snorkmaiden.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
But she's not made of snow?

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Stop! Snorkmaiden, stop!

04:55.000 --> 05:05.000
Snorkmaiden, snorkmaiden!

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
Oh, I'll praise the boobah. She's still breathing. She's just knocked herself out.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Oh, Mum and what's happened to her?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
She's unconscious.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
What are you trying to do?

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
I want to get her home to Mama.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Oh, difficult. She should lose a bit of weight.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
Perhaps she'd come around if we splashed cold water on her face.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Oh, there's nothing to fetch it in.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
Ah, if you cut some bark off a tree trunk, you could make a small container.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
What a good idea. If you stay here, I'll go and do that.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Wake up, Snorkmaiden.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Oh, that's cold.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Has she come around yet, Mr. Hemulet?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
No.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Okay.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Oh, good. It's working.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
How are you feeling, Snorkmaiden?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Are you all right, Snorkmaiden?

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Oh, where am I?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
We're still up in Lonely Mountains.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Who am I?

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
Why Royal Highness the Princess of Lonely Mountains?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
What? A Princess?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Oh, yes, of course.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
And who are you?

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
I am the Prince of Lonely Mountains.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Oh, yeah.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Oh, yeah.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
With that ridiculous shape?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
No, a gesture, perhaps.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
You want?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
You there. Do not laugh.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I think the poor girl must have lost her memory.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Of course not. She's just pretending.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
When does not whisper with royalty present, do you hear?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
So sorry, Royal Highness.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
A poor crafters cabin.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
This is your castle, ma'am.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Royalty doesn't live in shacks.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Snorkmaiden, stop calling us that.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
It's very rude.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Oh, forgive me.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
A royal castle is elsewhere.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Is it not?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
What?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
That must be hunting lodge.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
No, of course, that's what it is.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Good, we accept that.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Are you two going to tell me what you're so busy looking at?

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Send a maid to my room, my good man.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
A maid?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
My good man.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Papa, have you seen Snorkmaiden?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Yes, up there.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
Mama, please would you go on have a word with Snorkmaiden?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Have you been quarreling?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Oh, no.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
It's just that she fell and banged her head.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
And now she thinks she's a royal princess.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
What?

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Ah, Nanette, come here, please.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Nanette?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I'm Boomin, Mama.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Oh, we're too weary for your foolish jokes, girl.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Oh, we are very tired indeed, Nanette.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Please bring our silk nighty with the hand embroidered swans and clowns.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Then you may go.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
I wish you, Mama.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
All right, I'm sure.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
But she seems convinced she's a princess.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Sounds as if it's dangerous, doesn't it, Mama?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Oh, I don't think so.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
I was only joking when I called her a princess.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I'm very glad you didn't call her an opera singer.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Is Snorkmaiden asleep now?

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Oh, yes, in a night gown with crowns and swans embroidered on it.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
And another thing, Boomin, she wants a canopy put up immediately.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
What's that?

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
Oh, a fancy cover over the bed that's draped in silks, envelopes, and tassels.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Oh, she was very upset because there wasn't one there already.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
It might be necessary.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Her memory could have come back by the time she wakes up.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Why don't we wait and see?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
She might be fine after a rest.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I sure hope so.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
But what do we do if it hasn't come back?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Let's think about that if it happens.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
We might not have to build that canopy.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Let me try it.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Try what?

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
To get Snorkmaiden's memory back, what else?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Oh, how?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Well, I think that if she sees me, she'll remember me

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
and then she'll remember everything else too.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Don't be silly little Mai.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
If she doesn't remember me, why should you remember you, eh?

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Simple, because I'm unforgettable.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
There is that, I suppose.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
She's still fast asleep.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Well, I'm glad we made the canopy anyway.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
It looks really great, doesn't it?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Oh, oh, look.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
She's opening her eyes.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Are you awake?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Get up, Snorkmaiden.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Come on.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Let's go down to the beach.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
And who is that person?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Come on.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
You remember me.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I warn you if you know you'll be sorry.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Oh, quite amusing.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Ah, so you remember me now.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Of course we do.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
There you are, I told you.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Who am I then?

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Well, you're another court jester.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Of course.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
Ah, don't be little Mai.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
A court jester.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Oh, very funny.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
She's a better clown than the other one.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
You can perform it our wedding.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
You are a wedding.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I'm stinky.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
What are you doing here?

11:45.000 --> 11:48.500
I'm stinky.

11:48.500 --> 11:52.000
What are you doing here?

11:52.000 --> 12:05.000
Moment asked me to come over to Moment House and propose to some princess.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Moments lost his marbles as well then.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I think he wanted stinky as a contrast.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
You what?

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
You mean to tell me you're both my rivals for the hands of the royal princess?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Well, it's not very original.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
But in order to win the princess and have her kingdom stinky, you'll need to saw three riddles.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
Hey, that's great! What's this kingdom like?

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
All right, sooner number one, you may now enter.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Oh, that's me.

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
Oh, hi, princess. How are you doing?

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
Jester, is this man a suitor?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
He is.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
I fear he does not treat us with respect.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Forgive him, your highness.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
He is from a foreign land and does not know the ways of your kingdom.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Well, all right, very well.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Here is the first riddle. Are you ready?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Fire away!

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
Now then, listen, what is it that is yellow, has four legs and sings?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Oh, dear. And unusual, canary?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
With four legs, you nincomboop.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I don't know any birds with four legs, but I do.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
I don't know.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
I don't know.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
I don't know.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
I don't know.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
I don't know.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
I don't know.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
I don't know.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
With four legs, you nincomboop.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
I don't know any birds with four legs.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Who said it was a bird?

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
All right, then, what's the answer, snark baby?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
He shows no respect.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Throw him into a dungeon and give him no food.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
Your highness, he is temporarily out of his mind after the long journey here.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Hang on, I'm not out of my mind.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
How do I pee?

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
How for what's the answer? That's what I want to know.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Silence, it does not concern you.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
We believe you to be of lowly birth.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Sorry about this, napkin.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Don't worry.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Hmm, no, sir Gellad, but not bad.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
I am honored to be here, your royal highness.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
He'll do.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
An easy riddle to start.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Here it is.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
First, what is the number of which we think?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Take your time.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Two.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
For a faux-gallant night, that is correct.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Now listen, what is the word upon our mind?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Love.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
That's amazing.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
Truly, the suitor has brains as well as looks.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Question three.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
There are two numbers on our mind.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
What do they add up to?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Answer carefully for it.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Could unlock your princess's heart.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
21.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
Oh, was that right, too?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Oh no, it was 22.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
My heart is heavy.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
For chance we should have said it was correct.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
He was rather cute.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Was he not just her?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
It's your turn now, stinky.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
Well, I suppose that even half of Snortiles would be something.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Think she'll ever get her memory back?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Of course she will.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
This is not our idea of a suitor.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
His heart is aching for you, your royal highness.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Ah, let it ache.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Oh, all right.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I'll give him a chance.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Here is a question number one.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
What is the number we are thinking of?

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
Well of all our stupid questions.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
We haven't all day.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Oh, well of...

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Four.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Indeed not.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
It is 3,598,765.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Begone out.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Hey, Snortiles, that's up there.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
It's not fair right there, ma'am.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Go home.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Give me another one I want after.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Oh, what a rude suitor.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
We are no longer in the mood for royal marriage, Jester.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
At least not today.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
A wise decision.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
A princess of the lonely mountains.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
They will be prostrate with grief,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
but bid the other suitors to go home.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Do not let them beg.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
We would not like that.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Very well, your royal highness.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Do it kindly.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
We wish them no pain at all.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
From this day on, we shall devote ourselves to good works

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
and to the well-being of our people.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Oh.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
You, I didn't want to marry you anyway.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Wonder what Snort maintenance up to now?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Upstairs thinking.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
She says she'll devote her life to good works.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Works, what works?

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
I don't know, but she probably wants to be remembered

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
in the history books.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
The princess who was adored by her subjects.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Oh, she's coming down.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Your royal highness, may I assist you?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Send the net to us.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
She is on an errand, your highness.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Then have someone else make soup,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
nourishing but not too rich.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Soup, highness?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Yes indeed.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
And then we shall take it to our poor subjects ourselves.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
What kind of soup?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
We don't know.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
We eat. We don't cook.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
The poor will be happy with anything

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
brought by the princess herself.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Now hurry man, be quick about it.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Now she wants some soup.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
This will be ample.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
The poor do not eat much.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
It would only make the meal.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
I don't know anyone poor around here, your majesty.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Nonsense.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Do what, do what.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Greetings jester.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
What now?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
We're taking soup to the poor.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Made with our own regal fingers.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Do you know where they are jester?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Your fingers?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Oh, I know.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Good, wonderful.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Take us to them now.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
They will be so grateful.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
You back princess.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
That house there.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Oh yes.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
It's nice to know that the poor and my kingdom are so well off.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
Oh you, please come over here.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Hmm?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Who are you?

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
I'm the princess of Lonely Mountain.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Princess?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Oh!

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
What moment you're all highness?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Do not keep us waiting.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
We have a lot to do.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
I'm coming.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
I'm coming.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Forgive me you're all highness.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
I had no idea you were.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
My mind smart maiden.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
That common name again, we are princess.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Little sticks.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
You're not right in the head coming here bothering your elders

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
and betters like this.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Others?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Oh!

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Are you the queen men?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Hmm?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I am Mrs. Philly jog.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Now what do you want?

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
You're just fulfilling our royal duty bringing soup to the poor.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
Giving cheer to those less fortunate that ourselves.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Here my good woman.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Now if you just pour.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Oh, there you call me poor.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
You who doesn't have a stitch of clothing to your name.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
Oh, the rich aroma of the soup must have overcome you Mrs. Philly jog.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Ah!

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Eat it yourself your majesty.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Oh!

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
This is how I treason.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Send for the guard.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Take her to the tower.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Oh!

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Oh!

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
We cannot see.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
I'm afraid that serves you right, Snork maiden.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Snork maiden!

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Don't use that common name.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Help us.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
We cannot see.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Please don't steal.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Your royal highness.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Oh, hold a moment.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Oh, oh, oh.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I think it's stuck moment.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Use the hand.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Ah!

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Stop!

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
You heard it right.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
I'll get it on.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Out of the way.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Ah, wait a minute.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
You can't break that soup, Turin.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
It's a family heirloom.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
And you mustn't hit Snork maiden on the head.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
You might hurt her.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Stop fooling around and get this thing off, will you?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
All right.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Oh, poor smart maiden.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
You didn't have to get up that hard.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Difficult to judge it with a broom.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
I've never hit anyone wearing a soup, Turin, before.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Oh, you will write your royal highness.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Oh, forgive us, your royal highness.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Sprinkle some cold water over her face.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
No, she'd hate that, mama.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Snork maiden.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Ah, it's no good, woman.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I don't think she'll wake up today.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
I'm going to be late.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
I'm going to be late.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
I'm going to be late.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
I'm going to be late.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
I'm going to be late.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
I'm going to be late.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
I'm going to be late.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
I'm going to be late.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
I'm going to be late.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Oh, good, woman.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
I don't think she'll wake up to anything, but your royal highness.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Your highness.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Your highness.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Hang on.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Snork maiden.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
Oh, I'm so glad your royal highness is with us again.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
I hope your royal highness is not badly hurt.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
Where am I?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
In moment, Valley, of course, stupid.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Where do you think?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
That's weird.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
I thought, woman, and I had gone for a walk in the lonely mountains.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Didn't we, woman?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Huh?

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Do you remember who I am, Snork maiden?

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Woman, what are you talking about?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Of course I do.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
And you don't think you're a princess anymore?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Princess?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Have you gone crazy or something?

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
What princess?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
What do you mean, woman?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Hooray!

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
She's back to normal.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Snork maiden's back to normal.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Yes, it's nice to have you back again.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Yes, it's wonderful.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Welcome home.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
What is?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
What's wonderful?

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Have you all gone loopy or something?

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Never mind, Snork maiden.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
You bumped your head, that's all.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
And so Snork maiden's brief spell as a royal princess came to an end.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Except that she was the only one who didn't remember it.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
But everyone else in woman valley breathed a sigh of relief.

22:01.000 --> 22:12.000
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

22:12.000 --> 22:20.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
They're always happy and always at play.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:27.000 --> 22:42.000
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

22:42.000 --> 22:49.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
They're always happy and always at play.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
The movements.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
The movements.

23:04.000 --> 23:10.000
The movements.
