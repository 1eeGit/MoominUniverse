0	8000	Off we go then, Hank is away, he won't have to road too hard, the wind will pick us up soon.
9000	12000	Goodbye, have a good time, everyone.
12000	17000	Goodbye, Snuffkin, now don't forget to shut all the windows if it rains, will you?
17000	18000	No.
23000	25000	Up towards!
31000	36000	Hey! Wait for me, I want to have a good time too!
36000	39000	Hey, wait!
42000	45000	Look, Snuff is still waving.
45000	47000	He's a sweet boy.
48000	51000	Let's keep waving, Moonman, till we're out of sight.
51000	54000	Bye, Snuffkin! Bye, bye!
54000	56000	Bye!
56000	60000	No, I'm not waving goodbye, I want to go too!
60000	63000	Don't eat all the road, Mary Tabo, we're gone!
63000	66000	It's no good shouting little Mai, he can't hear you.
66000	71000	He's giving us a great send-off though, for Snuff, he should have come with us.
76000	79000	Nancy, I'm going off and leaving me here on my own.
85000	89000	Snuffkin, if you wouldn't mind, I think we need some music to send us on our way.
89000	91000	What do you say?
115000	118000	Are you sure we're on the right course for the island, Papa?
118000	122000	Yes, the winds with us and the sails are fine.
122000	126000	I bet if we keep this speed up, we'll be there by tomorrow.
126000	130000	Well, if the wind stays like this, you could be right.
145000	148000	The wind's not dying down at all.
148000	151000	I'm surprised, I never thought we'd keep up this speed.
151000	153000	Now make sure you're allergic.
153000	159000	Of course we will be, Papa, if we carry on like this, perhaps we'll see the light from the lighthouse while it's still dark.
159000	162000	Well, we don't want to hit anything at this speed.
162000	164000	Don't worry, we're watching.
164000	167000	Ah, this is the light.
175000	179000	Papa, the wind's dropped.
179000	184000	Well, that's strange, it shouldn't happen that quickly.
184000	187000	Do you want us to start rowing, Moomin, Papa?
187000	191000	No, Snuffkin, I think we'd better get some sleep.
193000	197000	Stupid wind, I really wanted to see the lighthouse at night.
197000	199000	It's getting foggy too.
199000	201000	I can't even see the stars anymore.
201000	205000	Right, Snuffkin, wake me in two hours and I'll take over.
205000	208000	Okay, Moomin, Papa.
221000	224000	What's the matter, Little My?
226000	228000	I thought I heard something.
229000	232000	It's coming from over there somewhere.
232000	235000	Can you see anything?
235000	239000	No, but I can hear it.
239000	243000	It's so good eye, and it's getting closer.
250000	252000	Little Moomin, Papa, get up, Moomin!
252000	255000	Stop it, Little My! What's the matter with you?
255000	257000	You too, Moomin, quickly, before it's too late!
257000	259000	What's the matter, Little My?
259000	264000	I can hear her ship, I can't see it, but it's very close and getting closer.
264000	266000	A ship? Where?
266000	268000	Over there, and she's bearing down on us.
268000	270000	Quickly, we don't have much time.
273000	275000	Yes, by the boobalier right.
275000	277000	We must let them know we're here, a signal.
277000	279000	Right, all hands on deck.
279000	282000	Maybe if we all shout as loud as we can.
282000	284000	Look!
284000	286000	Oh!
291000	293000	Too late for shouting!
293000	295000	It's huge!
295000	298000	Look out! It's gonna hit us!
299000	301000	I think Moomin's right, what can we do?
301000	305000	It's too late for anything, just brace ourselves and be ready to swim for it.
310000	312000	Quick, get down, Little My!
315000	317000	Oh!
323000	325000	I don't believe it!
325000	327000	Little My!
330000	332000	Huh?
332000	334000	That's hard, the ship didn't hit us.
334000	336000	Oh yes, he did!
336000	337000	What?
337000	339000	It went straight into our rudder when nothing happened!
339000	341000	It went right through us!
341000	345000	Right through us, that's impossible she couldn't have.
345000	348000	I wonder if there was anyone on board that ship.
348000	350000	I can't see any lights.
350000	353000	I know, Snuffkin, I think it's a ghost ship.
353000	355000	A ghost ship?
355000	358000	Well, there's no wash and no damage to us.
358000	360000	It's the only explanation, I think she's right.
360000	363000	A ghost ship, we've actually seen one.
364000	368000	Oh dear, oh dear, I need to sit down, all this excitement's too much.
368000	373000	Papa, don't they say that if you see a ghost ship, something terrible is gonna happen to you?
373000	377000	What happened in the first place to make it become a ghost ship? That's what I wanna know.
377000	380000	Well, that's just some old sailor's tail, Moomin.
380000	384000	If it had been a real ship, we'd probably be sinking now.
384000	386000	Don't you think so, Snuffkin?
386000	388000	Yeah, I suppose.
388000	391000	That's one way of looking at it.
391000	394000	Come on, cheer up you guys, at least it was fun.
394000	396000	What's the matter?
396000	397000	Has something happened?
397000	398000	What are you laughing at?
398000	400000	What's so funny?
400000	402000	Are you going to tell us?
402000	405000	Why didn't you wake me up, Moomin?
405000	406000	Oh!
406000	409000	Well, I think we're doing very well.
409000	411000	We're doing very well.
411000	413000	We're doing very well.
414000	416000	Oh!
416000	419000	Well, I think we're doing very well.
420000	424000	Oh, what a beautiful sky, just look at it.
424000	427000	Oh, the fog is lifting.
444000	448000	Oh, what's it dozed off?
451000	454000	Another beautiful day, not a ghost ship in sight.
458000	461000	The lighthouse.
462000	464000	Hey, wake up everybody, the lighthouse.
464000	467000	I can see the lighthouse we're there.
469000	472000	Oh, the sun shining, we must have slept for hours.
472000	475000	Oh, there it is.
475000	477000	This is ridiculous.
477000	479000	We've been next to it all night.
479000	481000	We could have gone and slept there.
481000	483000	I can't wait to go ashore.
483000	486000	All right, everyone, jump to it.
486000	488000	Man the old.
491000	493000	There's something strange going on here.
493000	495000	What is it, Snuffkin?
495000	496000	I'm not sure.
496000	497000	Moomin Papa.
497000	499000	Our boat didn't move at all last night, did it?
499000	502000	No, it doesn't seem to have moved at all.
502000	504000	So why couldn't we see the light from the lighthouse,
504000	506000	even when the fog cleared?
506000	508000	I can't work it out.
508000	511000	Yes, you're right, Snuffkin, it seems very odd.
511000	513000	We should have seen it.
513000	516000	Well, perhaps the lighthouse keeper forgot to put it on, Moomin Papa.
516000	518000	I don't think so, little Mai.
518000	520000	You can't forget a thing like that.
520000	523000	I suppose it could be broken.
523000	525000	There could be lots of reasons for it.
525000	527000	Why don't we hurry up and get ashore,
527000	530000	and then we can ask the keeper.
533000	536000	Look, there's someone in a boat.
536000	537000	Hmm.
537000	540000	It looks like he's fishing.
540000	542000	He know about the lighthouse.
542000	544000	He probably lives on the island.
544000	546000	Let's get closer.
546000	548000	Easy now.
549000	558000	Now, hoi there, good morning.
558000	561000	Any luck?
561000	566000	Not yet, but it's still early.
566000	569000	Hmm, yes, quite.
569000	571000	I'll ask him straight out.
571000	574000	Do you know if the lighthouse was working last night?
574000	576000	I don't know.
577000	580000	Sorry, I didn't catch that.
581000	583000	He said, no, it wasn't.
583000	584000	What did I tell you?
584000	586000	He forgot to light it.
586000	588000	Oh, it wasn't only last night.
588000	590000	You'll never see a light in that lighthouse.
590000	592000	Not even on stormy nights.
592000	593000	We'll never.
593000	595000	So what does the keeper do then?
595000	596000	Nothing.
596000	598000	There is an lighthouse keeper.
598000	600000	Why?
600000	601000	I'm sorry.
601000	602000	I'm afraid I don't know.
602000	605000	All I can say is I haven't seen one.
605000	607000	Do you live on the island?
607000	609000	Hey, mister.
609000	611000	You're asking too many questions.
611000	613000	Who are you?
613000	617000	I'm Moment Papa from Moment Valley, and this is my family.
617000	620000	We've come a long way in order to do some important work here.
620000	622000	No work on this island.
622000	624000	No, you better go back home.
624000	629000	You see, I've come here to research an epic novel about the sea.
629000	631000	Just turn around and go back.
631000	633000	You're too far from home.
633000	635000	Oh, please, wait.
635000	636000	Shh.
636000	637000	Dear, don't shout.
637000	639000	We mustn't scare the fish away.
639000	641000	Let's go a show and have some breakfast.
641000	643000	I expect we're all hungry.
651000	653000	Bunny, pair.
653000	655000	The old ones lost his marbles.
663000	665000	The old ones lost his marbles.
665000	667000	The old ones lost his marbles.
667000	669000	The old ones lost his marbles.
669000	671000	The old ones lost his marbles.
671000	673000	The old ones lost his marbles.
673000	675000	The old ones lost his marbles.
675000	679000	Look, Moment Papa. There's a path here leading to the lighthouse.
679000	683000	We'll leave this stuff here and we'll go and explore it first.
683000	685000	Right, to the lighthouse, everyone.
685000	687000	Up, bow.
687000	689000	Come on!
689000	691000	What's wrong?
691000	695000	Why do you always get so upset when somebody mentions the lighthouse?
695000	697000	It's not your call, sir.
697000	699000	Business boy doesn't concern you at all.
699000	701000	You were like that when I asked you about it before.
701000	705000	Maybe if you were to tell me, I might be able to understand.
705000	707000	I could try anyway.
707000	709000	Either talk about something else or keep quiet.
709000	711000	You understand that?
721000	725000	It's so very rocky, I don't think it would work.
725000	729000	What? A garden.
739000	741000	Hello there!
741000	743000	Is there anybody at home?
743000	745000	There's nobody here.
745000	749000	That boy was right. It's been empty for ages, I think.
751000	757000	Oh, the door was left unlocked. I know we do it, but most people don't.
757000	759000	Something terrible's happened.
759000	763000	Something terrible! Please, little my, you know I had things like that.
763000	765000	Don't worry, snort maiden.
765000	767000	Little my, it's just trying to scare you.
767000	769000	I don't like hearing about anything horrible.
769000	773000	Flag your ears then, snort maiden, because I haven't finished yet.
773000	775000	And the next bit's really horrible.
775000	777000	Oh, well, where have you been finished there?
777000	781000	Well, the lighthouse keeper is still up there.
781000	783000	He got scurvy and hats and been able to move for months.
783000	785000	And nobody's heard his cries for help.
785000	787000	And with no food, he's almost a skeleton.
787000	793000	If he isn't dead already, he'll be at the top of the stairs, crawling towards his fingers,
793000	795000	lading and ripped up ribbons and flowers, mouth.
795000	797000	God, it's endless, mouth.
797000	799000	Shut up, little my.
799000	801000	That's enough.
801000	803000	It was a good imagination though.
803000	805000	I'll let you use it in your book, if you like.
805000	807000	Come on, tell me what did she say, Moonman?
807000	809000	Oh, nothing, really. Nothing at all.
809000	813000	Tell me, Moonman, but leave out the bits I wouldn't like.
813000	817000	Where are you going, Papa?
817000	819000	Well, listen, everyone.
819000	821000	First, I'm going to get the lamp working.
821000	825000	Then we'll give the place a good clean and then we'll move in.
825000	827000	We'll be the new lighthouse keepers.
827000	833000	And once again, the seas around this island will be safe for ships to navigate in troubled water.
833000	835000	Come on, Papa!
835000	837000	Careful, careful.
837000	839000	Touch anything, that's dangerous.
845000	847000	Oh!
855000	857000	Will Moonman Papa be able to get the light working again?
857000	859000	Where is the lighthouse keeper?
859000	861000	And what could have made him go without locking the door,
861000	867000	leaving the ships in peril and the seas with no one to guide them away from the rocks?
869000	873000	And who is the mysterious fisherman?
875000	881000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the moments.
881000	889000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
889000	893000	They're always happy and always at play.
893000	897000	The movements are having fun day after day.
897000	901000	The movements.
901000	905000	The movements.
905000	909000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
911000	919000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
919000	923000	They're always happy and always at play.
923000	927000	The movements are having fun day after day.
927000	931000	The movements.
931000	935000	The movements.
935000	939000	The movements.
959000	961000	Here they are for one and all.
961000	965000	The movements are about to come.
965000	967000	Come on and sit down here with me.
967000	969000	They're here for you on your TV.
969000	973000	They are the movements.
973000	975000	They are the movements.
975000	977000	So come with me.
977000	979000	Give me your hand.
979000	981000	I'll take you up to a movement land.
981000	985000	You can fly just like a bird.
985000	987000	Sing that song ever.
987000	989000	They're with the movements.
989000	993000	They're with the movements.
993000	999000	They're with the movements.
999000	1003000	They're with the movements.
1003000	1007000	They're with the movements.
1019000	1046840	The movements came to this island to visit a real lighthouse, but when they got there,
1046840	1054840	I found it was completely deserted, no light, and no lighthouse keeper.
1054840	1063840	Woman Papa is going to try and mend the lamp, and the others are all helping to clean up.
1063840	1066840	This is it, then. Do you think it's broken, Papa?
1066840	1075840	Well, I'm not sure. I've not had a great deal of experience with this sort of thing.
1075840	1080840	Look over there, woman. It's the boy and the fisherman from the boat.
1080840	1082840	They're a bit strange, aren't they?
1082840	1085840	They must live somewhere here on the island.
1085840	1090840	Hmm, let's see. Let's see.
1090840	1094840	Oh, my God.
1095840	1108840	Oh, thank you. Leave it by the door when you haven't quite finished yet.
1108840	1111840	Well, at least we can see the floor now.
1111840	1115840	I think the keeper must be lying dead under the dust.
1115840	1118840	Nobody's cleaned here for a long time, that's for sure.
1118840	1122840	That probably means the lighthouse lamp hasn't been working for ages either.
1123840	1126840	I wonder if Papa will be able to fix it.
1126840	1132840	I wonder if they're going to manage to get the light working all right.
1132840	1140840	Well, the lighthouse without a lamp is pretty sad, isn't it?
1140840	1142840	Come on, light, will you?
1142840	1148840	Right, I'll give you one last chance.
1148840	1153840	Then I'm getting the big spanner. Now, you don't know me, but I don't give in easily, especially to machines.
1153840	1162840	Have you thought, brass brain, what will happen tonight if there's a storm and there's a ship out there looking for land or trying to keep off the rocks and there's no light to guide them?
1162840	1164840	You'll be sorry, Dan, but it'll be too late.
1164840	1168840	And all I can say is that if the light hasn't been working for some time,
1168840	1171840	then I'm afraid that there could have been many shipwrecks.
1171840	1173840	Oh, that's awful.
1173840	1177840	It would be dangerous to come too close to the island without a light to help you.
1177840	1181840	I wouldn't be surprised if that ghost ship went one of them.
1181840	1187840	It all seems very strange, and I wonder what made the lighthouse keeper leave in such a hurry.
1187840	1190840	Unspeakable horror, please be quiet, little my.
1190840	1191840	It's obvious.
1191840	1195840	Close thrown above dishes left unwashed, jigsaw puzzles have finished.
1195840	1199840	It's an unsolved mystery of the sea, just like the Marie Celeste.
1199840	1203840	And if you don't understand that, then you're being even stupider.
1203840	1205840	Then usual.
1205840	1208840	Oh dear poor man, I wonder what he was like.
1208840	1212840	He must have been very lonely here on his own.
1212840	1216840	He scribbled messages over the walls like no side of a ship.
1216840	1218840	It's Christmas, another month gone.
1218840	1224840	I must clean the lamp, and I need to talk to someone.
1224840	1229840	Oh, well, if he didn't see many ships, at least they could have been many shipwrecks either.
1229840	1231840	Oh, I hope not Papa.
1231840	1233840	That would be one good thing anyway.
1233840	1238840	Perhaps the sea came and took him on a dark and stormy night, and he was swept out, and no one saw him go.
1238840	1240840	That's rubbish, little my.
1240840	1245840	On dark and stormy nights, lighthouse keeper sits safe by a fire drinking hot tea laced with rum.
1245840	1248840	He might have run out of rum and gone to get more.
1248840	1251840	Well, I don't think anything terrible happened to him.
1251840	1255840	He just got more and more lonely and fed up, and then went off and got a girlfriend.
1255840	1257840	Be careful, snuffkin.
1257840	1260840	It's very rough and not even, and you don't want to fall into the sea.
1260840	1262840	I certainly don't.
1262840	1265840	Now, watch your step. The rocks are very slippery.
1265840	1268840	Are you alright?
1268840	1272840	Yes, Lang, so I didn't think they'd be a slippery as all that.
1272840	1274840	What's the matter?
1274840	1277840	Look over there. There's something moving, but I can't see what it is.
1277840	1279840	It's probably a boat.
1279840	1282840	No, that's what I call a real ship.
1282840	1284840	It's not a real one.
1284840	1286840	What do you mean?
1286840	1289840	It's the ghost ship, the one we saw last night.
1289840	1294840	You're right. Why isn't it come back snuffkin? What does it want?
1294840	1299840	I don't know. Perhaps it followed us to the island and for some reason wants to make contact.
1299840	1309840	Let's go home snuffkin. I don't like this.
1330840	1334840	What's up?
1334840	1338840	I'm having a great dream and you can be with me.
1338840	1341840	Oh, it was horrible. Someone stepped on my face.
1341840	1343840	Well, none of us sleep.
1343840	1345840	We were all asleep. What are you doing?
1345840	1347840	It's very odd.
1350840	1353840	No, somebody's on my stomach now.
1353840	1356840	Don't be stupid.
1356840	1361840	Oh, I have a look snuffkin. There must be something there. Please snuffkin, please.
1361840	1364840	I can't see any.
1364840	1366840	What's that?
1366840	1367840	What is it?
1367840	1371840	I don't know yet, movement. I think I can see a pair of feet.
1371840	1372840	A pair of feet.
1372840	1374840	No legs, just feet.
1374840	1376840	But that means a ghost.
1376840	1379840	Oh, help! Get it off me! Go away, go away!
1379840	1385840	Let me at them! Where are they? I'll teach them to spoil my dream!
1385840	1388840	They're on my face now. Go away, will you?
1388840	1390840	Show me it, but no, stamp on it!
1390840	1391840	Stop it, move!
1391840	1393840	No, it's my foot!
1409840	1411840	You go fishing again today?
1411840	1412840	No, I'm not.
1412840	1416840	Oh, do you need me or is it alright if I go and see those people?
1416840	1417840	In the lighthouse.
1417840	1419840	Oh, don't let you want.
1419840	1421840	Okay, goodbye then.
1427840	1429840	You mean this room is really haunted?
1429840	1431840	It certainly is.
1431840	1433840	But we only saw a pair of feet.
1434840	1437840	I'll sleep here tonight. Don't worry. I'll protect you.
1437840	1439840	Are you going to scare it away, Papa?
1439840	1441840	Mm-hmm.
1443840	1445840	I can't find any good shells.
1445840	1447840	You're me.
1451840	1453840	What about this one?
1453840	1455840	Oh, yes, that's lovely.
1457840	1460840	Go on, take it. I don't collect them.
1463840	1464840	Who are you?
1464840	1466840	Well, I'm a ghost, sort of.
1466840	1468840	Are you the rat who walked over us last night?
1468840	1470840	You were lucky I didn't grab you.
1470840	1472840	Sorry, it wasn't just me.
1472840	1473840	There were a few of us.
1473840	1474840	And walk over each other.
1474840	1476840	Can I give you a present?
1476840	1478840	You can't get around me that easily.
1478840	1480840	You better show yourselves or you'll be sorry.
1480840	1482840	It's just me.
1482840	1484840	The others have all left me and gone off with the ship.
1484840	1487840	Ha, so why didn't you go with them?
1487840	1490840	Oh, I wanted to, but uh, well...
1490840	1492840	Come on, out with it.
1492840	1498840	Never got me and left me all of my own and I was frightened.
1498840	1502840	Well, I can see why they wouldn't want a drippy thing like you around.
1502840	1504840	You call yourself a ghost.
1504840	1507840	No, I'm sorry.
1507840	1510840	I just can't work out what's wrong with it.
1510840	1513840	Let's try and see what happens here.
1513840	1518840	Oh, oh, oh, oh, heavens, oh, my.
1518840	1520840	Oh, good.
1520840	1523840	Oh, no, oh, what?
1529840	1531840	Oh, you were right, papa.
1531840	1533840	Oh, thank goodness you're here, quick.
1533840	1536840	Open all the windows, I'm chocky.
1536840	1543840	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
1550840	1560840	Mmm, this is great. That soup I've had for ages, Moome and Mama.
1560840	1561840	Would you like some more?
1561840	1568840	Oh, he has, please. Can I have the recipe? I could make some for the fisherman. I know he'd love it.
1568840	1571840	I'll write it out for you. What's his name?
1571840	1577840	I don't know. He doesn't say. I've come from the north. I left about three months ago.
1577840	1583840	Although it seems a lot longer, and I'd been rowing south in my small boat, trying to reach Moome and Valley.
1583840	1585840	Oh, really? We live there.
1585840	1590840	Do you? You're lucky. It must be very nice. I've never been there, but I've heard that it's beautiful.
1590840	1598840	Anyway, there was a violent storm in my little boat capsized. He rescued me, and I've stayed with him in his cabin ever since.
1598840	1602840	And he doesn't talk about himself at all. That's very strange.
1602840	1605840	No, but I think he does have a big secret.
1606840	1607840	How do you know, Toft?
1607840	1612840	Well, sometimes he just stares and stares at the lighthouse in any sort of size.
1612840	1613840	I wonder why.
1613840	1617840	I did ask him once, but he glared at me in such a nasty way.
1617840	1619840	I haven't dared say a word about it since.
1619840	1621840	You don't want to stay with him then?
1621840	1630840	Oh, yes. Well, most of the time he's really nice to me, and since I've been here, I've sort of taken care of him, because you see he doesn't really look after himself.
1630840	1633840	Can I have a cup of tea, please, Mama?
1634840	1637840	Yes, dear. How is the light coming along?
1637840	1640840	Oh, not very well. There's still a few more things I could try, though.
1640840	1643840	Hello. You were on that boat fishing, weren't you?
1643840	1646840	Yes, I was. My name is Toft, Mum and Papa.
1646840	1652840	Oh, please, to meet you. Is your friend here as well? I wanted to ask him something. There's something ever quite important.
1652840	1653840	Ask him what?
1653840	1656840	Well, about this lighthouse for one thing.
1656840	1659840	Well, he won't talk about that. He just refuses to.
1659840	1664840	Oh, dear, does he? The thing is, I'm trying to light this beacon, but having no success.
1664840	1669840	I wondered whether he might know if there's an easy way of doing it. You never know. I haven't missed something.
1669840	1672840	It's very quiet.
1672840	1674840	He might be out fishing, you know.
1674840	1676840	Come on, let's go.
1676840	1678840	Where are you going, Moomin?
1678840	1680840	I want to ask that man some questions.
1680840	1683840	He doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who does a lot of talking.
1683840	1686840	Do you think he might know something about the lighthouse keeper?
1686840	1688840	That's what I want to find out.
1690840	1700840	Hello, my name is Moomin, and this is my friend Snuffkin.
1700840	1703840	What's your business here?
1703840	1709840	I wonder, do you live here? I suppose you must have met the lighthouse keeper, have you?
1709840	1711840	I didn't want people to talk about that.
1711840	1715840	We were just curious about why you left the lighthouse. Do you know why?
1715840	1718840	No, he kept himself to himself.
1718840	1723840	Oh, so you do know it. When did he leave? Where did he go? You must know.
1723840	1724840	Get.
1724840	1728840	Oh, please. Had the light stopped working before he left?
1728840	1732840	Why did he leave the door open? Were there any shipwrecks?
1732840	1735840	Oh! Wait a minute. Just one more question, please.
1735840	1739840	Oh, don't go. There's something very important I need to know.
1739840	1742840	You're the only other person on the island apart from the go ship.
1742840	1746840	Oh, please come back. Look, my father is trying to get the lamp working again,
1746840	1750840	but not getting anywhere. So if you know where the keeper is, or better still,
1750840	1754840	how to light it when you please help, it's not only for us, but for all those ships
1754840	1758840	that might be in danger without it.
1760840	1762840	Moomin.
1762840	1765840	I don't think that man knows much about anything.
1765840	1769840	Well, at least he's heard you and knows what you want.
1769840	1771840	Let's go, Moomin.
1777840	1782840	Look, over there, what's Moomin Papa doing?
1782840	1786840	Snork made an a little Maya helping him.
1786840	1788840	Hiya!
1788840	1790840	Come on.
1790840	1792840	Yeah.
1792840	1796840	It's about time. Where are you two being?
1796840	1800840	What are you building now? We're making a raft. Why?
1800840	1804840	Because we wanted to stupid, why else would we build it? Do you like it?
1804840	1806840	But why do you want a raft?
1806840	1809840	It's not really a raft, is it Papa?
1809840	1812840	Let me present our very own hand-built ghost ship.
1812840	1814840	A ghost ship?
1814840	1818840	He must be here somewhere.
1818840	1822840	Well, if he's the one that walked on me last night, I want a word with him.
1822840	1826840	Yeah, sorry. I'm afraid that was me.
1826840	1828840	I want a word with him.
1828840	1831840	Yeah, sorry. I'm afraid that was me and my friends.
1831840	1833840	Oh, where are you?
1833840	1836840	Show us a bit of leg at least. I like to see you I'm talking to.
1836840	1839840	Yes, all right.
1839840	1843840	Oh, well, at least he looks like a ghost.
1843840	1844840	Thank you.
1844840	1847840	Ghosts look pretty silly when the sun's shining if you ask me.
1847840	1849840	Well, it was your idea.
1849840	1851840	I always thought ghosts were frightening.
1851840	1853840	Yes, we forgot our chains last night.
1853840	1855840	It's very hard to be ghostly without them.
1855840	1857840	We did our best to scare you, though.
1857840	1860840	The ghost came to this island because a lighthouse was a bit like an ancient castle.
1860840	1862840	We feel more at home in castle.
1862840	1865840	And now when they found us here, they changed their minds and gave up.
1865840	1867840	That's funny, isn't it?
1867840	1869840	What's the matter?
1869840	1871840	You look a bit fed up.
1871840	1874840	That's because he's been left behind by the other ghosts.
1874840	1876840	They've gone off in the ghost ship.
1876840	1879840	Wow, they didn't tell me they were going straight away.
1879840	1882840	And I'd gone to the lighthouse keepers cabin.
1882840	1884840	The lighthouse keeper?
1884840	1885840	Why did you go there?
1885840	1888840	Well, I wanted to tell him that some strange people.
1888840	1889840	I'm sorry.
1889840	1893840	I mean, strangers had moved into the lighthouse and that he'd be better off with us
1893840	1895840	because ghosts don't damage things.
1895840	1897840	I didn't know you then, of course.
1897840	1898840	But some people are very kind.
1898840	1899840	Where is his cabin?
1899840	1901840	Is it easy to find?
1901840	1903840	At the southern end of the island.
1903840	1906840	But it was a waste of time because he wouldn't talk to me.
1906840	1907840	I shouldn't have bothered.
1907840	1909840	And then I would have caught the boat.
1909840	1912840	Anyway, he's not going back to his job, so that's that.
1913840	1914840	Bye-bye.
1914840	1916840	Thanks again for the raft.
1916840	1917840	Take care.
1917840	1920840	I hope you catch up with your friends real soon.
1920840	1921840	Thank you.
1921840	1922840	You're okay for mortals.
1922840	1925840	I promise next time we meet Abbey Rally's scurry.
1925840	1926840	Chains and all.
1926840	1929840	Lots of chains and we promise to be terrified.
1929840	1932840	You can come and scare me anytime you want.
1932840	1934840	Bye-bye.
1934840	1935840	Relating a try.
1935840	1936840	Bye-bye.
1936840	1937840	Bye-bye.
1937840	1941840	He said anything that could float would do.
1941840	1944840	But that raft seemed a bit flimsy to me.
1944840	1945840	I wouldn't like to chance it.
1945840	1947840	It can be rough out there.
1947840	1949840	Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
1949840	1950840	Those can't drown.
1950840	1951840	Can they?
1951840	1952840	They're dead already.
1959840	1960840	Mama.
1960840	1962840	What is it, Mum and Dia?
1962840	1964840	Papa's gone fishing again.
1964840	1967840	Well, he enjoys it.
1967840	1969840	Well, that's all he seems to do these days.
1969840	1972840	He's not working on the lamp at all.
1972840	1975840	Well, perhaps living in a new place makes him want to do a new thing.
1975840	1978840	And he does catch one now and again.
1983840	1985840	What are you making, little boy?
1985840	1986840	An elevator.
1986840	1988840	An elevator?
1988840	1991840	Yes, and when that's finished, I'm going to build a house.
1991840	1992840	Oh, my goodness.
1992840	1994840	A house of my very own.
2000840	2002840	Mum and Papa doesn't seem his usual happy self,
2002840	2005840	even though he enjoys his fishing.
2005840	2008840	He's upset that he couldn't make the lamp work
2008840	2010840	and isn't used to failure,
2010840	2013840	but nothing he tries makes any difference.
2013840	2015840	What a pity it would be to leave the island
2015840	2018840	without seeing the beautiful beams shining over the water.
2029840	2031840	MUSIC
2050840	2051840	Yeah, hey!
2051840	2053840	Come and have a look, everyone!
2053840	2054840	I finished my house.
2054840	2055840	Huh?
2056840	2057840	Hey, Mum and Papa!
2057840	2059840	Come here, the fisherman's coming!
2060840	2061840	Wow, the fisherman!
2064840	2065840	Yes, and the boy is with them!
2065840	2067840	He's off to his outside?
2074840	2076840	You don't want to do it, do you?
2076840	2078840	No, but I gotta do it.
2080840	2081840	Right!
2088840	2090840	Here you are.
2095840	2098840	So, what can we do for you?
2104840	2105840	Oh!
2108840	2111840	Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you!
2112840	2113840	Hmm?
2113840	2118840	Tough just told us it's your birthday today, so all the best wishes from us.
2118840	2121840	My birthday? Is it really?
2121840	2124840	Excuse me for asking, but how old are you?
2124840	2126840	I just don't remember.
2126840	2130840	It doesn't matter. I'm sorry we don't have any presents.
2133840	2136840	I haven't had coffee for many, many years.
2137840	2140840	Bring the barrel, woman mama.
2140840	2141840	Yes, dear.
2142840	2144840	Now, let me see. I found this...
2144840	2145840	...sawester.
2146840	2149840	I wonder if it suits me. What do you think?
2149840	2150840	Well...
2150840	2153840	I suppose this must belong to the lighthouse keeper.
2156840	2158840	Why don't you try it on?
2158840	2161840	You look good in a sowester. There it suits you.
2161840	2168840	We'd love to know why you left the island and why you didn't come back here.
2168840	2171840	And also why you didn't like the land.
2171840	2175840	We really would like to know if you feel you could tell us.
2177840	2179840	I was so lonely.
2179840	2181840	For years and years.
2181840	2184840	Then I just went away.
2185840	2187840	I'm afraid that's all.
2188840	2192840	But you did come back. Surely that must mean something.
2192840	2197840	I knew I'd lived here for too long. Much too long.
2197840	2200840	You see, I didn't really fit in anywhere else.
2206840	2211840	This is the lighthouse keeper's uniform, isn't it? Why don't you put it on again?
2211840	2215840	And look, it's nice here. I'd like to stay. Would you mind that?
2215840	2217840	I'll stay if you let me.
2217840	2219840	Ah, I'd love that.
2219840	2223840	It'd be fun to see you looking like a lighthouse keeper.
2233840	2236840	Oh, hooray!
2245840	2249840	Three days later, the Moomans left the island.
2249840	2257840	They decided to leave at night with the safe blow of the lighthouse beans guiding their path out and away to Mooman Valley.
2257840	2265840	Mooman Papa had quite forgotten about his epic novel of the sea, but couldn't wait to start again on his memoirs.
2266840	2270840	The Moomans
2271840	2278840	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomans
2278840	2285840	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomans
2286840	2296840	They're always happy and always at play. The Moomans are having fun day after day. The Moomans
2296840	2300840	The Moomans
2300840	2307840	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomans
2307840	2314840	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomans
2315840	2325840	They're always happy and always at play. The Moomans are having fun day after day. The Moomans
2325840	2329840	The Moomans
2329840	2335840	The Moomans
2344840	2369840	Here they are for one and all. The Moomans are about to call. Come on and sit down here with me. They're for you on your TV. They are the Moomans
2369840	2372840	They are the Moomans
2372840	2375840	So come with me, give me your hand
2375840	2378840	I'll take you up to a moment land
2378840	2381840	You can fly just like a bird
2381840	2386840	Sing that song ever, there were the Moomans
2386840	2389840	There were the Moomans
2389840	2392840	There were the Moomans
2392840	2395840	There were the Moomans
2395840	2398840	There were the Moomans
2398840	2401840	There were the Moomans
2407840	2410840	Mom
2413840	2415840	Everything's so boring
2415840	2416840	Let's do something then
2416840	2422840	Like what, for instance, I think we've done everything one could possibly do
2422840	2426840	None of you three can think of a single thing to do. You're useless, aren't you?
2426840	2430840	Well, can you think of anything except catching grasshoppers?
2430840	2433840	There must be something we can do
2433840	2440840	Now we've all had times like this, haven't we? Fortunately, right then, the mailman arrived
2440840	2443840	Hello, a letter for you
2443840	2447840	Oh, a letter that must be from my sister for me
2447840	2450840	Oh no, it's from a woman Papa this time
2450840	2455840	That's all? Who would write to him? A woman? Someone called Jane?
2455840	2456840	Huh?
2456840	2458840	See that he gets it now
2458840	2460840	Who could this Jane possibly be?
2460840	2463840	It's your father's old girlfriend, of course
2463840	2464840	Never
2464840	2466840	Oh, I'm sure he had dozens and dozens
2466840	2469840	Moom and Papa was very kind and handsome young man
2469840	2471840	A voice from the past
2471840	2474840	Moom and Papa, liquid, I've got for you
2475840	2476840	Hmm
2478840	2480840	Oh, no
2480840	2481840	I was right
2481840	2482840	Yeah, you were
2484840	2487840	Moom and Mama, I think you should go back to the kitchen
2487840	2489840	Whatever, for a little lie
2489840	2492840	Because Moom and Papa store me youth is catching up with him
2492840	2495840	Please, Papa, tell us it's not that kind of letter
2495840	2498840	Oh, what would you do?
2499840	2500840	Don't worry
2500840	2505840	Whatever it was, it was a long time ago, long before I ever met you
2505840	2508840	No, it's not that kind of letter
2508840	2510840	What sort of letter is it then?
2510840	2513840	Oh, much worse, it's from Aunt Jane
2513840	2514840	Who's that?
2514840	2517840	Mine, my dear, is on my father's side
2517840	2519840	Oh, how boring
2519840	2522840	You look very pale suddenly, dear
2522840	2525840	Yes, because she's coming for a visit tomorrow
2525840	2530840	Oh, don't worry, there's plenty of time for arranging a welcome party
2530840	2534840	But I don't like her, and I don't want her to come for a visit
2534840	2536840	Moom and Papa, why not?
2536840	2538840	Well, you'll soon see, she's very rich
2538840	2540840	Very rich
2540840	2544840	Yes, and she bosses everyone, and we won't have a moment of peace
2544840	2548840	Oh, maybe she's so rich, she'll give us all wonderful presents
2548840	2553840	Goodness, this is so unexpected, why is she coming here all of a sudden?
2553840	2558840	Oh, she says she wants to discuss money matters, good heavens with me
2558840	2561840	She says there's no one else, so you see, I'm in a very difficult situation
2561840	2564840	Oh, why can't you tell if you're not an expert?
2564840	2568840	You don't tell Aunt Jane things, she tells you when that's that
2568840	2570840	Is that what you explained?
2570840	2572840	When you meet her, you'll know exactly what I mean
2572840	2575840	What do I know about money matters?
2575840	2576840	Nothing
2576840	2578840	Not surprising since we've never had any
2578840	2582840	How can she expect a poor creature like you to know anything about money?
2582840	2585840	Also, she's very, very suspicious
2585840	2588840	And she says money is a terrible burden
2588840	2591840	Oh, I wouldn't mind shouldering her burden
2591840	2594840	Maybe you'll inherit it, and then we could share the money
2594840	2597840	And have a wonderful time together
2598840	2620840	This time, I almost did it
2620840	2650840	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
2650840	2679840	I'm sure she jumped at it. Hmm, there'd be no harm in asking, I guess. What's the matter, Mr.
2679840	2685840	Hamilton, you look so unhappy. I'm stuck, that's my problem. How's that?
2686840	2696840	Stuck in my research, this magnifying glass is very good, of course, but I just can't get any further with my botanical research with this old fashioned equipment.
2697840	2706840	What I really need is a microscope and a laboratory. Hmm, and they're expensive, I guess. Yes, they are, and I don't have any money.
2706840	2713840	Well, moment Papa's aunt is coming over tomorrow, and I know she's got any amount of money. Any amount, Sniff?
2714840	2724840	I'll get her to finance you, Hamilton, and we'll get a big greenhouse, and you'll grow orchids and roses and other things, and then we'll sell them, oh, oh, I'll get rich. You too!
2736840	2764840	Hey, you over there. Hmm, are you talking to me? Of course I am. Who else? I say do you know the way to move in a house young man? Yes, she might say I do. Show me where it is then.
2765840	2773840	Over there, it's tall and blue, just follow that stream and you can't miss it. Good, would you be kind enough to take my suitcase?
2774840	2779840	I'm sorry I can't, I'm too busy. I'll reward you handsomely for your efforts, think again young man.
2780840	2784840	But all I want to do is fish. What? You don't want money?
2785840	2791840	I heard you were coming to visit moment Papa, you're a Jane, aren't you?
2791840	2797840	Oh, well, please to meet you, I'm here to take you to moment house. Is this your suitcase?
2800840	2803840	Wow, this suitcase is very heavy.
2803840	2806840	Should be, it's full of golden coins.
2807840	2813840	Oh, I'll take care of this. Let's go and take.
2822840	2829840	I can't stay in this house, I don't think I can take Aunt Jane. I'm going to hide out in the cave until she's gone.
2830840	2842840	Bye bye, then dear. Careful now Aunt Jane. The banks have been slippery here and there.
2849840	2853840	A roundhouse, how stupid, typical of my nephew.
2853840	2856840	Welcome to moment house Aunt Jane.
2856840	2858840	Welcome Aunt Jane.
2858840	2861840	I'd like you to meet us up in a minute.
2861840	2863840	Please to meet you.
2865840	2867840	She's very small for a daughter.
2867840	2871840	Oh little Mai isn't ours, she just lives here.
2871840	2873840	And I won't get any bigger, either.
2873840	2876840	Hmm, she's like a member of the family.
2876840	2880840	And where's my worthless nephew? Why isn't he here?
2880840	2884840	Oh, well, he's not, is he not at home?
2885840	2888840	Well, no, when will he be back? I don't know.
2888840	2892840	He's away looking for inspiration for his work, so he won't be back for a while.
2892840	2895840	Since when has he worked? I'm here to see him.
2895840	2897840	Maybe you can see me instead.
2897840	2901840	What a splendid idea, how clever of you, moment.
2901840	2903840	Ridiculous, he knows nothing about money.
2903840	2910840	In that case, it is high time he learned. As for his father, I may still disinherit him.
2911840	2915840	I'm a member of his family, too. I could talk to you about money matters.
2915840	2916840	Really?
2916840	2919840	Oh, sniff is a great friend of mine.
2919840	2921840	Hmm.
2921840	2925840	But hardly a member of the family.
2925840	2929840	Hello, moment. And you must be on Jane.
2929840	2934840	I brought my brother to snort with me. He wanted to meet you.
2934840	2937840	This is Aunt Jane, the nice dog.
2938840	2940840	Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane.
2940840	2945840	This is my lovely sister, snort maiden, who is Moomin's special friend.
2945840	2948840	The snorts and the Moomin's may one day be related.
2948840	2951840	So in a way, we're all really family.
2951840	2954840	You maybe, but not to me.
2954840	2959840	I'm an inventor, and due to an accident, I'm looking around for a sponsor.
2959840	2963840	A golden opportunity for anyone with some loose capital.
2963840	2966840	Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane.
2966840	2969840	I'm Hemmielin, a botanist of note.
2969840	2973840	I heard that you might be willing to fund my scientific research, Aunt Jane.
2973840	2977840	A golden opportunity for anyone with some spare money, eh?
2977840	2979840	You'd like me to fund your research?
2979840	2981840	It was my idea.
2981840	2986840	If we built a greenhouse and grow rare orchids and roses, we can make a lot of money.
2986840	2988840	And you'll make a lot of money.
2988840	2990840	Young man, I have a lot of money already.
2990840	2993840	Oh, hasn't sniff discussed this with you, Mom?
2993840	2994840	Yes, sniff.
2994840	2996840	Well, I was just getting around to it, Hemmielin.
2996840	2997840	Confusing?
2997840	3001840	When I am famous for my botanical research, Aunt Jane, I...
3001840	3003840	I don't know that will ever happen.
3003840	3005840	This is very confusing indeed for me.
3005840	3008840	Now, you're snorkemaid and a friend of Moomin, is that right?
3008840	3010840	Oh, no, I'm the snorric snort maiden's brother.
3010840	3012840	I'm a friend of Moomin, Aunt Jane.
3012840	3015840	Did you really explain about my important research, Sniff?
3015840	3018840	Did you really explain that I'm a member of the family?
3018840	3020840	Hey, she got it!
3020840	3024840	So, Aunt Jane would be grateful to all of you and make you a member of the family.
3024840	3026840	Thank you, Aunt Jane.
3038840	3040840	Here's your rule, Aunt Jane.
3040840	3044840	Oh, I do hope you'll be comfortable here.
3044840	3046840	Just call if you need anything.
3051840	3053840	Oh...
3053840	3055840	Come out.
3060840	3062840	Here's your suitcase.
3062840	3063840	It was very heavy.
3063840	3064840	Thank you.
3067840	3069840	Hemm...
3069840	3070840	What is it?
3070840	3071840	You want a reward?
3071840	3073840	No, no, Aunt Jane.
3073840	3077840	I mean, yes, I do, but...
3078840	3079840	Uh...
3079840	3080840	Which is it?
3080840	3082840	Will you make up your mind, young man?
3082840	3085840	I know where Moomin Papa is right now.
3085840	3087840	He's a whale and a trip, I know.
3087840	3089840	No, no. He's somewhere quite near.
3089840	3091840	Quite near here?
3091840	3092840	Well, where is he?
3092840	3095840	Moomin Papa said not to tell you where he's hiding.
3095840	3096840	It's a secret.
3096840	3097840	A secret?
3097840	3098840	Yes.
3098840	3101840	I suppose I could tell you, but he'll be very angry.
3101840	3103840	Where is he? Tell me now.
3103840	3106840	Well, if I tell you I'm taking a big risk...
3106840	3107840	Hmm.
3107840	3108840	Oh, very well.
3108840	3110840	How much do you want?
3110840	3112840	I'll leave that to you.
3134840	3136840	Thank you for the information.
3136840	3138840	Now you shall have your reward.
3138840	3140840	Hold out your hand.
3140840	3143840	Oh, is that all?
3143840	3147840	Until I've seen him for myself with my own eyes.
3147840	3148840	Yes!
3154840	3155840	Huh?
3155840	3156840	What?
3156840	3159840	Oh, there's nobody here.
3159840	3161840	Where is my worthless nephew?
3161840	3164840	Hey, this is very strange.
3164840	3167840	You tricked me, haven't you?
3167840	3170840	Well, no, I swear I would never do that.
3170840	3173840	You certainly deserve no reward.
3173840	3174840	Huh?
3174840	3175840	But no, wait.
3175840	3177840	If we just look around, we'll find him.
3177840	3179840	He's in here somewhere I know it.
3179840	3182840	Hey, Moomin Papa, I got rid of her.
3187840	3189840	Moomin, Mama.
3189840	3191840	Yes, Aunt Jane, what is it?
3191840	3194840	Tell me where my nephew is hiding.
3194840	3196840	Well, as I said before...
3196840	3198840	I want to know the truth.
3198840	3199840	Dear, he's...
3199840	3201840	Now let me see...
3201840	3202840	Come on, hurry up.
3202840	3205840	He's hiding in the cave down by the beach.
3205840	3209840	I've just been there, Moomin Mama, and I can't find him.
3209840	3212840	Then he really must have gone away on a trip.
3212840	3215840	And why should he want to hide from me anyway?
3215840	3218840	I think he might be a little bit afraid of you.
3218840	3219840	Afraid of me?
3219840	3221840	Afraid of his own aunt?
3221840	3223840	But why?
3223840	3225840	Mostly he's afraid of money matters.
3225840	3226840	Incredible.
3226840	3229840	Afraid of me because of money matters?
3229840	3232840	He must be utterly mad.
3232840	3234840	What a family.
3234840	3236840	I don't understand.
3236840	3242840	It seems that only Smith knows anything about money.
3242840	3245840	I know where Moomin Papa is right now.
3245840	3248840	So you want some of my gold, who do you young lady?
3248840	3251840	I couldn't care less about your silly gold.
3251840	3253840	My silly gold indeed.
3253840	3257840	With silly gold, I assure you you can do just anything you want.
3257840	3262840	Seems to me your silly gold doesn't even help you to find Moomin Papa.
3262840	3263840	Hmm?
3263840	3265840	I think you should forget about your money.
3265840	3269840	Young lady, money isn't something you can just forget about.
3269840	3271840	It needs constant looking after.
3271840	3274840	That's why I must talk to Moomin Papa at once.
3274840	3277840	Now take me to that rascal nephew of mine.
3277840	3280840	If you really know where he is, do you hear me?
3280840	3283840	Do you have me?
3283840	3284840	Of course.
3284840	3286840	Oh wow, frivolous.
3286840	3287840	Not really.
3287840	3292840	If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too.
3292840	3295840	Oh well, Frederick and I were frivolous once.
3295840	3296840	Really?
3296840	3297840	Of course.
3297840	3298840	Oh wow, frivolous.
3298840	3299840	Not really.
3299840	3302840	If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too.
3302840	3303840	I'd be frivolous once.
3303840	3304840	Really?
3304840	3308840	If you say so, I suppose I have to believe you.
3311840	3312840	Huh?
3312840	3313840	Look.
3313840	3314840	What?
3314840	3317840	Little May and Anne Jane walking together.
3319840	3321840	What are they doing?
3321840	3323840	Little May is plotting something.
3323840	3324840	Really?
3324840	3326840	Moomin?
3326840	3333840	Sniffs are right, really.
3333840	3338840	But sometimes he just can't withstand the lure of gold.
3338840	3340840	Check me.
3340840	3341840	No.
3341840	3343840	Well you can't be right.
3343840	3345840	Let's go back then.
3345840	3349840	Fine, just take your time.
3349840	3350840	Hi guys.
3350840	3353840	Little May, what's the matter?
3353840	3354840	We have a guest.
3354840	3355840	A guest?
3356840	3358840	Moomin Papa.
3358840	3360840	What?
3360840	3362840	Moomin Papa.
3366840	3368840	Woah.
3368840	3369840	So.
3369840	3372840	This is where you've been hiding.
3372840	3373840	What else?
3373840	3374840	Wait.
3374840	3375840	I have to shoot you.
3375840	3379840	And I have to go back.
3379840	3380840	Wait and Jane.
3380840	3382840	No, you wait first.
3382840	3384480	Oh, no!
3384480	3387220	Ah!
3387220	3388100	Wait, please.
3388100	3390320	Momen Papa was sort of on his way back from a trip
3390320	3392480	and then stopped by to play chess with me.
3392480	3394320	Yes, exactly.
3394320	3395160	No, yes!
3395160	3397220	Momen Mama told her the truth!
3397220	3400460	Oh, I sort of stopped by.
3400460	3403060	Why are you so afraid of me, young man?
3403060	3404700	Well, I'm not not really.
3404700	3406040	I mean, it's not you.
3406040	3406720	It's your money.
3406720	3408680	I'm afraid of it, really scared.
3408680	3410680	Scared of my money?
3410680	3411980	Well, I'm not.
3412840	3416340	It's perfectly good money at all in gold coins.
3416340	3419840	Listen nephew, I'm depending on you as my only relative.
3419840	3421840	Yes, yes, please depend.
3421840	3425340	When I get too old to do it, you must look after my gold for me.
3425340	3426840	I'm relying on you.
3426840	3428840	No, that's not possible.
3428840	3430840	I know and Jane, we can give it all away.
3430840	3432840	Must be those who'd love to have it.
3432840	3435840	Must be those who need it more than we do.
3435840	3437840	Oh, a green pearl!
3443840	3445840	She's crazy.
3445840	3447840	Don't worry, we'll think of something.
3447840	3451840	Oh, you would throw my money away without a cut.
3451840	3453840	Why didn't you mean to hurt you and Jane?
3453840	3455840	I know, let's put it all in the bank.
3455840	3458840	Money likes being in the bank.
3458840	3460840	My money would hate being in a bag.
3460840	3463840	It's a terrible idea.
3463840	3466840	Oh, no, banks are so nice nowadays.
3468840	3469840	They all...
3469840	3474840	Of course, they have flowers and shiny piggy banks and pretty paintings on the wall.
3474840	3477840	Is that really true?
3477840	3479840	Right, come on everybody.
3479840	3483840	Let's hurry home and fix a welcoming party for Jane.
3483840	3485840	Oh, you're right.
3485840	3486840	You're right.
3486840	3487840	You're right.
3487840	3488840	Come on everybody.
3488840	3492840	Let's hurry home and fix a welcoming party for Jane.
3492840	3494840	A party!
3494840	3497840	Yes, any reason is good enough.
3507840	3510840	This was Grandma's best cake recipe.
3510840	3512840	Welcome at Jane.
3512840	3517840	Let's drink a toast to the only millionaire in our small circle.
3517840	3520840	May she live a long and healthy life.
3520840	3521840	Cheers!
3521840	3523840	Cheers!
3529840	3532840	Now, this is your welcoming party at Jane.
3532840	3533840	What's the matter?
3533840	3537840	Never in my life of I and my money felt ourselves as welcomed before.
3537840	3540840	I'm so happy I could cry.
3540840	3544840	Oh, and once you start crying, you just want to go aww.
3544840	3545840	Not again.
3545840	3548840	Please don't be unhappy at Jane, don't cry.
3548840	3550840	Oh, dear!
3550840	3552840	Mum and Papa!
3552840	3554840	Mum and Papa!
3554840	3556840	Yes, and Jane, what is it?
3556840	3562840	I'll put some of my gold in a bank, but you must look after the rest when I'm too old.
3562840	3565840	And why not?
3565840	3566840	All right.
3566840	3570840	We'll keep it in the cellar and make a nice little niche for it with seashells and moss.
3570840	3573840	And I'll have someone go down and look at it every week.
3573840	3576840	Don't you worry, and Jane, your money will be in safe hands.
3576840	3578840	Not quite, but I had in mind.
3578840	3579840	I know.
3579840	3582840	But I suppose it can't be helped.
3582840	3586840	It sounds rather nice, a cozy little niche down in the cellar.
3586840	3592840	And if you take a look every week, but oh, dear, it will miss me.
3592840	3593840	Oh, and Jane.
3593840	3594840	Very well.
3594840	3596840	I have made up my mind.
3596840	3602840	I'm leaving this suitcase with you now, so you and my gold can get certain used to each other.
3602840	3604840	Do what you want with it.
3604840	3606840	Your friends seem to have ideas about how to spend it.
3606840	3610840	Flying ships and botanical research sound rather splendid.
3610840	3612840	Ooh!
3612840	3614840	Wonderful!
3614840	3616840	I'm so happy for you.
3616840	3620840	Darn, I should have let us up better than flowers.
3624840	3628840	So end of the visit of the credit and Jane.
3628840	3634840	And I'm sure Sniff will be able to think of some other use for the gold.
3658840	3670840	The moment, the moment, the moment, the moment.
3688840	3696840	Here they are for one and all.
3696840	3700840	The moments are about to come.
3700840	3702840	Come on and sit down here with me.
3702840	3704840	They're here for you on your TV.
3704840	3706840	They are the moments.
3706840	3710840	They are the moments.
3710840	3712840	So come with me.
3712840	3714840	Give me your hand.
3714840	3716840	I'll take you up to a moment land.
3716840	3720840	You can fly just like a bird.
3720840	3722840	Sing that song ever.
3722840	3724840	There were the moments.
3724840	3728840	There were the moments.
3728840	3732840	There were the moments.
3732840	3736840	There were the moments.
3736840	3740840	There were the moments.
3746840	3760840	One day in Newman Valley, not long before midsummer on a perfectly ordinary day,
3760840	3764840	Sniffkin suddenly announced that he was going on a short trip.
3764840	3766840	Where are you going, Sniffkin?
3766840	3768840	Well, not very far.
3768840	3772840	I'll be back right after midsummer.
3772840	3776840	But Sniffkin, you'll miss the bonfire at the big party.
3776840	3778840	But why in the world are you going away?
3778840	3780840	There's something I've been dying to do for a long time,
3780840	3784840	and it has to be done on midsummer eve.
3784840	3790840	I promise to tell you all about it, as soon as I'm back in Newman Valley.
3790840	3794840	Little did Sniffkin know that before he came back,
3794840	3796840	the underwater volcano which had kept quiet ever since
3796840	3800840	Moon and Papa's youth would wake up again.
3814840	3816840	What's all that smoke?
3816840	3820840	Is it the volcano and your father's memoirs?
3820840	3824840	I don't think I like this.
3824840	3826840	I don't think I like this.
3826840	3828840	I think it's exciting.
3828840	3830840	Well, in that case, you can have it.
3830840	3832840	Moon and Mama.
3832840	3834840	Yes, what is it, dear?
3834840	3836840	This hammock is shaking.
3836840	3838840	It's very unpleasant.
3838840	3840840	I think it's that volcano you told us about.
3840840	3842840	Yes, I guess it must be.
3842840	3844840	Mama!
3844840	3846840	Papa!
3846840	3848840	There's a smoke rising from the city, Papa!
3848840	3850840	No!
3858840	3860840	Oh, that's very odd.
3860840	3862840	What is it, Papa?
3864840	3866840	Let me see!
3866840	3868840	What's going on?
3868840	3870840	I don't know, really.
3870840	3872840	I guess there isn't much we can do.
3872840	3874840	Hey!
3874840	3876840	I can't see.
3876840	3878840	Where is it?
3878840	3880840	Let me see.
3880840	3882840	No, I'm at first.
3882840	3884840	Yes, no, I've got it.
3884840	3886840	Please, let me see!
3886840	3888840	No, I'm at first!
3888840	3892840	Moon and Papa, will these earthquakes begin your youth?
3892840	3894840	No, they certainly weren't.
3894840	3896840	And this one's underwater.
3896840	3898840	Oh, might net cause a tide of waves?
3898840	3900840	A tide of waves.
3900840	3902840	Goodness, I never thought of that.
3902840	3904840	Hey, what are you doing?
3904840	3906840	Snatch at me, lad.
3906840	3908840	What do you think?
3908840	3910840	Can you see anything unusual, Moon and Papa?
3910840	3912840	I've never seen anything like it.
3912840	3914840	This is very unusual.
3914840	3916840	Oh, my!
3916840	3918840	I want to see it too!
3918840	3920840	Come on!
3920840	3922840	How can you bite during a catastrophe?
3922840	3924840	Whatever you do, don't!
3924840	3926840	Right the top!
3926840	3928840	Oh!
3928840	3930840	Oh!
3930840	3932840	Oh!
3932840	3934840	Oh!
3934840	3936840	You're so stupid.
3936840	3938840	You should have let me have it first.
3938840	3940840	It's all your fault, little my.
3940840	3942840	Anyone can see that.
3942840	3944840	How dare you say it was all my fault?
3944840	3946840	It was just fault the whole way.
3950840	3952840	Snort maiden?
3952840	3954840	Yes.
3954840	3956840	So why don't you stay over in Moomin House?
3956840	3958840	You'd be careful.
3958840	3960840	You look after her, won't you, Moomin Papa?
3960840	3962840	Certainly, Snort.
3962840	3964840	I don't like the look of things.
3964840	3966840	No, do I.
3966840	3968840	No, do I.
3968840	3970840	We better get inside, Moomin House quickly.
3970840	3972840	Everybody has to stay together.
3972840	3974840	It's scary.
3974840	3978840	You're in the earthquake, Snort maiden.
3984840	3986840	Snort maiden?
3986840	3988840	Snort maiden?
3988840	3990840	Snort maiden?
3990840	3992840	Snort maiden?
3992840	3994840	Snort maiden?
3994840	3996840	Snort maiden?
3996840	3998840	Snort maiden?
3998840	4000840	Snort maiden?
4000840	4002840	Snort maiden?
4002840	4004840	Snort maiden?
4004840	4006840	Snort maiden?
4006840	4008840	Snort maiden?
4008840	4010840	Snort maiden?
4010840	4012840	Snort maiden?
4012840	4014840	Snort maiden?
4014840	4016840	Snort maiden?
4016840	4018840	Snort maiden?
4018840	4020840	Snort maiden?
4020840	4022840	Snort maiden?
4022840	4024840	Snort maiden?
4024840	4026840	Snort maiden?
4026840	4028840	Snort maiden?
4028840	4030840	Snort maiden?
4030840	4032840	Snort maiden?
4032840	4034840	Snort maiden?
4034840	4036840	Snort maiden?
4036840	4038840	Snort maiden?
4048840	4050840	Oh, yeah!
4050840	4054840	What's that noise?
4054840	4056840	Listen, can you hear?
4056840	4058840	A noise?
4058840	4060840	What noise?
4060840	4062840	I don't know.
4062840	4064840	Sounds like water to me.
4064840	4071840	Oh no! What's happened? Movement House has drifted off to sea.
4073840	4076840	I don't believe this.
4077840	4081840	I think Movement Valley is flooded. It really is.
4084840	4087840	What's happened to the kitchen and dining room?
4087840	4089840	Just because I feared.
4089840	4091840	What are we going to do?
4091840	4094840	Movement Mama can't even prepare breakfast down there.
4094840	4097840	Oh, good morning. You're up early today.
4097840	4101840	Mama, Movement House is flooded. All of Movement Valley is under water.
4101840	4105840	Oh dear, I think you're right, Movement. It's Papa's still asleep.
4105840	4109840	Let's go and wake him up. He definitely wouldn't want to miss it.
4109840	4111840	Boy, I'm sleepy.
4111840	4113840	I'm even sleepy.
4113840	4115840	I didn't sleep a wink because he was snoring.
4115840	4118840	Little Mai was snoring so hard. The whole bed was shaking.
4118840	4121840	I'm going to have a nap as soon as I've had something to eat.
4121840	4124840	Hey, Sniff!
4124840	4127840	What's this? Where am I? What's happened here?
4127840	4129840	Movement House has flooded, Sniff.
4129840	4133840	Oh, Papa! This means I'll have to swim to get home.
4133840	4136840	You'll have to dive to get into your house.
4136840	4139840	Hmm, unless I'm mistaken, the water is still rising.
4139840	4143840	Movement Papa, you've got to do something. Do something right away.
4143840	4146840	I think you better start taking swimming lessons.
4147840	4150840	And don't worry, Sniff. I'll start organizing.
4150840	4152840	What do you want to organize, Movement Mama?
4152840	4155840	Well, dear, I guess we should have some breakfast first of all.
4155840	4156840	Yes!
4156840	4159840	But how do we get into the kitchen, Papa?
4159840	4162840	You just leave that to me.
4164840	4167840	There, your kitchen.
4167840	4170840	I've never seen it from above before.
4170840	4172840	Oh, my goodness.
4172840	4176840	People should look at their rooms from above once in a while.
4176840	4180840	Look, cars of food floating from the cellar.
4180840	4183840	What luck we have a trap door!
4183840	4185840	Mama, shall I dive in and get them?
4185840	4188840	Yes, please, Movement. Be careful, Movement.
4188840	4190840	It's got to be done.
4190840	4194840	Hurry up, Movement. I'm hungry.
4203840	4205840	Could you get us some bowls and plates this time?
4205840	4206840	Sure.
4221840	4224840	And indeed, the water was still rising.
4224840	4227840	It's coming. It's coming. Help!
4229840	4231840	The water's up to the third floor.
4231840	4234840	What are we going to do, Movement Papa? Where's Movement Papa?
4234840	4237840	He's up on the roof, Sniff, with the others.
4237840	4239840	What are they doing up on the roof?
4239840	4241840	Ah, there goes another poorly built house.
4241840	4244840	Why doesn't our house float away, Papa?
4244840	4247840	It's all very simple, dear son. I built it myself.
4247840	4250840	If you hadn't, maybe we wouldn't be about to sink altogether.
4250840	4252840	Here we are.
4252840	4256840	Are you coming to help me, everybody?
4257840	4261840	This is one of Grandma's best plates, so please be extra careful.
4261840	4265840	I know. But where do you think we're going, Mama?
4265840	4270840	Something will float by. Big enough to take all of us. We just have to wait.
4270840	4274840	I'm not gonna wait for that. I think this family's out in touch with reality.
4274840	4277840	Something big enough will float by indeed, huh?
4277840	4280840	I'm gonna sink my old skin while I'm still tired.
4282840	4285840	This is something I should have done immediately, but it's not too late.
4287840	4291840	Look, there's a whole house drifting by.
4291840	4295840	Oh, you're right. It's very odd looking house, though.
4295840	4298840	Yes, it does look funny, but I think we'd better take it.
4298840	4302840	Hmm. That's the one we're getting.
4302840	4305840	Help me!
4305840	4309840	Stop! I'm coming with you!
4309840	4312840	Don't leave me behind.
4313840	4316840	Where's that house?
4316840	4319840	Right over there. Just there. Can't you see it, Sniff?
4319840	4324840	Oh, that house. What? You call that a house?
4338840	4341840	Hurry up, Sniff! What are you doing?
4341840	4344840	I just changed my mind. That one looks like it's going to sink.
4344840	4347840	No, it's fine. We're all aboard. Come on.
4347840	4351840	I don't believe you. Soon as I'm aboard, it'll sink. I can feel it.
4351840	4355840	He's scared of his own shadow. Let's leave him. Move any such a whimp.
4355840	4357840	Come on. It's all right.
4357840	4361840	Now, don't worry about me. You can let go of the ladder. I'm fine.
4361840	4365840	Stay behind if you like, Sniff. Look what about your breakfast?
4366840	4371840	We have all the food here, and you might get hungry, and if you do, there'll be nothing to eat.
4371840	4374840	Why didn't you say so before?
4374840	4379840	And now, hold the ladder steady. I don't want to be abandoned.
4379840	4384840	No, brother. He's gonna make it. You know, what is it he actually ever followed?
4388840	4392840	Hey, I'm falling on it. I'm falling on it.
4392840	4395840	No, don't do the same. Don't shake it.
4395840	4399840	No, don't shake it. Hold the steady.
4402840	4406840	Excuse us. Hello, anybody home.
4406840	4408840	Don't worry. We're not dangerous.
4408840	4412840	Isn't breakfast ready yet? I'm starving to death.
4412840	4414840	There's no one here, Papa.
4414840	4417840	I think you're right. It certainly seems empty.
4417840	4421840	Oh, and the most exciting empty house I've ever seen.
4421840	4428840	Why do you say that? What do you mean exciting? Do you mean interesting or do you mean scary little my?
4428840	4432840	Interesting and scary. Look, Snorgmaiden. Look around.
4432840	4435840	Oh, what a lot of mirrors.
4435840	4438840	This house must have been full of women who loved clothes.
4438840	4443840	Or maybe just one woman, Snorgmaiden, who had as many faces as there are mirrors in this room.
4443840	4448840	I don't like that. Look, every mirror has a chair in front of it.
4448840	4453840	It's like so. This house was full of ladies and each had her own little mirror.
4460840	4463840	Thank goodness we brought some plates with us.
4463840	4469840	Woman, mama, woman, mama. Look what I found. Bread and apples.
4469840	4472840	How nice, sniff. Now we can have a real breakfast.
4472840	4474840	But where is everybody?
4474840	4479840	Well, I don't know. Somewhere around.
4482840	4486840	Whoever lived here must have had a lot of strange hobbies.
4486840	4489840	You're so right.
4489840	4491840	Who said that?
4491840	4495840	Wow, look at that cog wheel. This snork would love that.
4495840	4499840	I wonder what woman will say about this little mind?
4499840	4503840	I'm sure he'll say you look better without anything.
4503840	4507840	But one look at you and he won't even notice anything else.
4507840	4510840	Well, if he has any sense, he will fall for me like a ton of bricks.
4510840	4513840	You want about breakfast, woman, mama?
4513840	4518840	We'll have breakfast as soon as we are all here. I wonder where they can all be.
4518840	4522840	You know, it's very bad for me to go hungry. I always feel unwell if I don't eat.
4522840	4527840	All right, sniff. You go ahead. But mind you don't eat all the apples.
4527840	4529840	Leave some for the others, won't you?
4529840	4534840	Oh, don't worry. Of course I will, mom and mama.
4540840	4542840	This is an apple.
4542840	4545840	Oh, but where on earth did you find them, Sniff?
4545840	4547840	In a frugal.
4547840	4550840	But normal trick to play on people making false fruit.
4550840	4553840	I very upset.
4553840	4556840	Oh, this is not bread.
4556840	4558840	Who?
4562840	4565840	Who could have done such a cruel thing to me?
4565840	4568840	Somebody with a very odd sense of humor, I'd say.
4568840	4570840	Somebody without anything.
4570840	4574840	Have some cheese instead, that at least comes from Moomin Valley.
4574840	4577840	And it looks delicious.
4578840	4581840	Whatever these levers for.
4582840	4584840	Uh-huh.
4584840	4587840	What's that hear you sound? It's creepy.
4588840	4591840	Can't you hear it? It sounds like a new earthquake.
4591840	4593840	Yes, I can hear it.
4593840	4598840	It's scary and spooky and creepy. All you need is try to be out of my mind.
4598840	4602840	Oh, I wonder what it can be. It's very strange indeed.
4602840	4606840	I just don't think I can take another earthquake right now, Moomin.
4606840	4607840	Yeah?
4607840	4610840	Oh, my goodness. Oh, look. What is it, Sniff?
4610840	4613840	Look, Moomin, Moomin, look!
4613840	4615840	Why? Our table is gone.
4615840	4618840	This is a haunted mansion, Moomin, Moomin.
4618840	4622840	Well, they can't take grandma's plates just like that.
4622840	4625840	You could have them laid back, but I'll keep the cheese.
4625840	4627840	I like cheese.
4628840	4631840	This is good cheese. You bet, Moomin, Moomin.
4631840	4633840	Yes, I certainly did.
4633840	4635840	Better not let our food out of sight.
4635840	4638840	Let's get out of this house, please, Moomin, Moomin.
4638840	4640840	What's this?
4640840	4642840	What's happening?
4644840	4646840	Moomin, you'll have to get out of here. What?
4646840	4647840	What?
4647840	4648840	What?
4648840	4649840	What?
4649840	4650840	What?
4650840	4651840	What?
4651840	4652840	What?
4656840	4658840	What?
4658840	4659840	What?
4659840	4660840	What?
4660840	4661840	What?
4661840	4662840	What?
4662840	4663840	What?
4663840	4664840	What?
4664840	4665840	What?
4665840	4666840	What?
4666840	4667840	What?
4668840	4669840	What?
4669840	4670840	What?
4670840	4671840	What?
4671840	4672840	What?
4672840	4673840	What?
4673840	4675840	Papa, was it the witch who was laughing?
4675840	4676840	No.
4676840	4678840	The doctor's coming from that ugly one.
4678840	4679840	What?
4679840	4680840	What?
4680840	4682840	Be behind there.
4689840	4692840	Did I hear someone call me an ugly thing just now?
4692840	4694840	Oh, excuse us, Madam.
4694840	4696840	You must be the owner of this house.
4696840	4697840	No.
4698840	4700840	Indeed, I am not.
4700840	4701840	Most certainly not.
4701840	4702840	You are greatly mistaken.
4702840	4704840	This is no house you fold.
4704840	4705840	This is a theater.
4705840	4706840	A theater?
4706840	4707840	Yes.
4707840	4710840	This is a stage where the heroin receives a standing ovation
4710840	4712840	at the end of the last act.
4712840	4714840	And the bread and the apples are props.
4714840	4717840	And the rumour you are playing is where the actors make themselves
4717840	4719840	up to become totally different people.
4719840	4721840	Kings are murderers.
4721840	4723840	Oh, and you are one of these actors?
4724840	4725840	And actress.
4725840	4727840	You understand less than nothing.
4727840	4729840	See this brum here?
4729840	4731840	This is my only prop.
4731840	4733840	I sweep the dust in this theater.
4733840	4734840	Oh, really?
4734840	4737840	I have wielded this brum for nearly 20 years.
4737840	4739840	Would nobody help me?
4739840	4742840	20 years I have cleaned this theater beautifully.
4742840	4744840	My name is Emma.
4744840	4746840	Emma.
4746840	4747840	And you.
4747840	4750840	You better remember that this is a theater.
4750840	4751840	This is no ordinary house.
4751840	4754840	And it is a great honor for you to be here at all.
4754840	4756840	That's true.
4756840	4759840	Does this mean that we can stay here just for a while?
4759840	4761840	Yes, until the actors return.
4761840	4764840	Today they all came to a low-verset.
4764840	4766840	Wow.
4766840	4768840	Really cool.
4768840	4769840	Yes, it certainly is.
4769840	4771840	We'll try not to bother you, Emma.
4771840	4793840	What have you done?
4793840	4800840	Oh, well, what have you done?
4800840	4805840	We seem to have hit a tree, so the house has stopped.
4805840	4808840	This is a theater not a house.
4808840	4810840	Oh, it's a rowing tree.
4810840	4815840	How lovely it looks, how nice you have crashed into such a beautiful tree.
4815840	4816840	It's gorgeous.
4816840	4818840	And that smell.
4818840	4819840	You know what?
4819840	4822840	I'd like to spend the night in that great idea, movement.
4822840	4824840	I'm coming with you, how exciting.
4824840	4826840	You better stay here.
4826840	4828840	You're bound to fall into the water.
4829840	4830840	Look who's talking.
4830840	4831840	Scary cat.
4831840	4833840	That looks safe.
4833840	4835840	We could easily spend the night here.
4835840	4839840	We better tie the theater to the tree, so it won't drift away.
4839840	4841840	If that's all right with Emma.
4841840	4844840	Emma, is it all right to tie the theater to the tree?
4844840	4845840	Do what you want.
4845840	4848840	As long as you don't damage the theater to get here.
4848840	4850840	All right.
4850840	4853840	Don't whistle you idiot.
4853840	4855840	Don't ever whistle in a theater.
4855840	4857840	That's the worst luck possible.
4857840	4859840	Oh, how dare you.
4859840	4860840	Oh.
4873840	4875840	This is great snorkemaiden.
4875840	4877840	We can look at the moon.
4877840	4878840	And the flowers.
4878840	4880840	They smell so good.
4881840	4883840	What's the matter?
4883840	4885840	I hope that snorke's all right.
4885840	4886840	Don't you worry.
4886840	4890840	He was standing guard over a flying ship after all.
4890840	4894840	All you have to do is get on board and fly away.
4916840	4920840	What's going on here?
4920840	4921840	Huh?
4921840	4928840	No, they're trying to destroy the pamphor's box.
4928840	4930840	I've never seen anything like it.
4930840	4933840	These people are bunch of vandals.
4933840	4934840	Oh.
4946840	4950840	Meanwhile, movement and snorkemaiden are fast asleep,
4950840	4953840	blissfully unaware of what was happening.
4953840	4958840	But whatever will they do, stranded on the treetop?
4958840	4961840	They love those afterruns.
4961840	4964840	They're not the only ones who can get on board.
4964840	4966840	They're the only ones who can get on board.
4966840	4968840	They're the only ones who can get on board.
4968840	4970840	They're the only ones who can get on board.
4970840	4972840	They're the only ones who can get on board.
4973840	4980840	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
4980840	4987840	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
4987840	4991840	They're always happy and goes at play.
4991840	4995840	The movements are having fun day after day.
4995840	5008840	The movements, the movements, the movements.
5025840	5034840	Here they are for one and all.
5034840	5037840	The movements are about to come.
5037840	5040840	Come on and sit down here with me.
5040840	5043840	They're here for you on your TV.
5043840	5045840	They are the movements.
5045840	5048840	They are the movements.
5048840	5051840	So come with me, give me your hand.
5051840	5054840	I'll take you up to a movement land.
5054840	5057840	You can fly just like a bird.
5057840	5059840	Sing that song ever.
5059840	5062840	There were the movements.
5062840	5065840	There were the movements.
5065840	5074840	There were the movements.
5074840	5078840	There were the movements.
5084840	5106280	The sun was high in the sky, and the floating theater had floated away a long time ago.
5106280	5114120	Oh, I feel so good.
5114120	5119320	I really slept like a log all night.
5119320	5127400	It's so lovely to be out in the fresh air with Moomin and a tree in blue.
5127400	5134120	No! No! The house is gone! I mean, the theater is gone!
5134120	5139720	Moomin! What? Wake up, Moomin! Wake up! There's been a catastrophe! Wake up!
5139720	5143000	What's a catastrophe? Look down!
5143000	5146680	The theater's floated off during the night.
5146680	5150120	I don't believe it.
5158600	5163080	It has! It's gone! I can't see it anywhere.
5163080	5170280	It must be far away by now. Moomin, your father's walking stick! Huh?
5170280	5174920	It must have got loose in the middle of the night while everybody was asleep.
5179400	5182120	Crying won't solve the problems, don't made it?
5182120	5185960	But we're stranded in a row and tree with water all around us.
5201080	5201880	Huh?
5207480	5212760	Huh? Oh, no! We're in a drift! We're floating away!
5212760	5214120	We're drifting away!
5217000	5220760	Oh, what are we going to do?
5220760	5224440	Moomin and Snorkmaiden are still up in that beautiful row and tree.
5224440	5225960	That's just typical.
5225960	5228920	Where is it? And the Hagenuim drifted so far away.
5229000	5231320	He whistled last night, didn't you?
5231320	5234920	I told you never to do that in a theater that brings bad luck.
5242920	5244920	Help! Help!
5244920	5248920	Don't get back here, too happy. Let's go upstairs!
5248920	5250920	Stop right here!
5250920	5252920	Oh, little mind!
5255720	5256920	Oh, no!
5257320	5258920	Oh, that was me!
5258920	5260120	Oh, dear!
5260120	5262120	Oh, little mind!
5262120	5265720	Oh, get this hurry! You're so mean and so mean!
5265720	5268920	Little mind is drifting off.
5268920	5271720	Scenes were stranded and that's not a bad thing.
5271720	5273720	The aiders shouldn't swim about like that.
5281720	5284120	I'm too scared to get over to your side.
5284120	5286120	You must be brave, Snorkmaiden.
5286120	5288120	I'll catch you so you want to fall, okay?
5296120	5298120	I told you so, the branch didn't break, did it?
5298120	5300120	Thank you for saving me!
5308120	5310120	Are you all right, Moomin?
5310120	5314120	I can stand up, Snorkmaiden. Look, the water's only ankle deep.
5314120	5315120	Really?
5316120	5318120	Oh!
5322120	5324120	Are you all right, Snorkmaiden?
5324120	5326120	Yes, it's so shallow.
5328120	5332120	I wonder where I'm going to end up.
5332120	5336120	It doesn't matter, I rather like this boat.
5336120	5338120	It's a nice, I'll go back to sleep for a while.
5338120	5348120	It's getting dark, isn't it?
5348120	5350120	Oh?
5354120	5356120	Yes, dry land! Look there!
5356120	5358120	A fire!
5358120	5360120	Must be people over there.
5360120	5362120	Yes!
5368120	5378120	Of course I forgotten tonight's mid-summer eve!
5398120	5406120	What a strange catch!
5412120	5414120	So the Moomin's split up.
5414120	5416120	Are they in trouble, little Mai?
5416120	5418120	Yeah, seems I was probably the luckiest one as usual.
5418120	5420120	More!
5420120	5424120	I'm sorry you can't have any more, that's all I have.
5424120	5426120	I don't believe you, your bag's still full.
5426120	5428120	Yes, but not with food, little Mai.
5428120	5430120	What's in it then?
5430120	5432120	You'll soon find out.
5434120	5436120	Where are we going?
5436120	5438120	To a park.
5438120	5440120	I hope there's a hot dog stand there.
5456120	5460120	Those two over there are the park keeper and his wife.
5460120	5462120	Look, they're always watching.
5462120	5466120	They guard a lot of poor orphans who come to the park every day.
5466120	5468120	Really?
5468120	5470120	Look over there!
5474120	5476120	Unbelievable!
5486120	5490120	Hey, what's this?
5490120	5492120	Hey kids!
5492120	5496120	Come on everybody, we're here to let you out.
5496120	5498120	Come quickly, hurry!
5498120	5500120	We can't go anywhere.
5500120	5502120	We have to sit right here so they can see us.
5502120	5506120	Yeah, otherwise they might lose one of us.
5506120	5510120	What a lot of signs, no walking on grass, no shouting, no running!
5510120	5512120	What a lot of rules!
5512120	5514120	What are they good for, Snuffkin?
5514120	5516120	Nothing, nothing at all.
5516120	5518120	And that's why we're going to pull them up.
5518120	5520120	No, you mustn't.
5520120	5522120	I don't think one is allowed to do that.
5522120	5524120	And you have to walk on the grass.
5524120	5526120	Yes indeed.
5526120	5528120	And I really like walking on the grass.
5528120	5530120	I always have.
5530120	5532120	No buts.
5532120	5534120	Come on everybody, let's make a start.
5540120	5542120	That looks like fun, I'll pull some too.
5542120	5544120	What are you doing?
5544120	5548120	Can't you read, there's a sign saying it's forbidden to pull up times?
5548120	5550120	This one?
5550120	5552120	Yes!
5552120	5554120	Oh, oh, sir!
5554120	5556120	Oh!
5556120	5558120	Oh!
5558120	5560120	Oh!
5560120	5562120	Oh!
5562120	5564120	Oh!
5564120	5566120	I'm beautiful, sir!
5566120	5568120	Bye bye!
5568120	5570120	Oh!
5570120	5572120	Oh!
5572120	5574120	There you free, go run!
5574120	5576120	Okay!
5580120	5582120	Stop!
5582120	5584120	Wait!
5584120	5586120	Oh!
5586120	5588120	What an awesome pose!
5588120	5590120	My goodness!
5590120	5592120	Those little balls are shining!
5592120	5594120	Oh!
5594120	5596120	Oh!
5596120	5598120	Oh!
5598120	5600120	That hurts!
5600120	5602120	Wait, right, those were howdy fat receipts.
5602120	5604120	Come on everybody, run!
5610120	5612120	Oh, get out of here!
5612120	5614120	Someone help!
5614120	5616120	Someone help!
5616120	5618120	They're after me!
5618120	5620120	Get down! Get away!
5620120	5622120	Quick!
5622120	5624120	They're terrible!
5624120	5628120	Where could that floating theater have gone?
5628120	5632120	They're still following us!
5634120	5638120	Come on, you kids, you can go wherever you want!
5638120	5640120	Do what you like!
5640120	5642120	Yeah, but I don't know what I want!
5642120	5644120	Me neither!
5644120	5646120	I think they want to go with you, Snuffkin!
5646120	5648120	But I don't know anything about small children.
5648120	5650120	I'm not sure I even like them!
5650120	5652120	All we have to do is find a theater!
5652120	5654120	Mum and Mama will know what to do!
5654120	5656120	In that case, let's go!
5678120	5680120	A house!
5680120	5682120	The lights are on!
5682120	5684120	Maybe they're celebrating with some relief!
5684120	5686120	Shall we go there?
5686120	5688120	Yes!
5700120	5702120	Oh!
5702120	5704120	At last!
5704120	5706120	Oh!
5706120	5708120	Hello, happy midsummer!
5708120	5710120	What can I do for you?
5710120	5712120	Would you have seen a theater drifting around somewhere, ma'am?
5712120	5714120	A theater?
5714120	5716120	Yes, you see a drifted away in the flood!
5716120	5718120	And my powers are on it!
5718120	5720120	Oh dear, I haven't seen anything like that!
5720120	5722120	Oh, what a pity!
5722120	5724120	Thank you! We'll look elsewhere!
5724120	5726120	Have a nice midsummer party!
5726120	5728120	Party?
5728120	5730120	Oh yes, a party!
5730120	5732120	Thank you very much!
5732120	5734120	Very well then, I'll say goodnight!
5738120	5740120	Did we say something wrong, Mum?
5740120	5742120	I don't know!
5752120	5754120	What's the matter?
5754120	5756120	I think she's crying!
5756120	5758120	Oh!
5758120	5760120	Hello!
5760120	5762120	Is there anything we can do, anything at all?
5762120	5764120	Aren't you having a party, ma'am?
5764120	5766120	No, unfortunately, she's not coming this year either!
5766120	5768120	Who is she?
5768120	5770120	My aunt and my father's side!
5770120	5774120	I invite her every year for a midsummer party, but she never comes!
5774120	5776120	How sad! You must be very fond of her!
5776120	5778120	Oh no! She's an awful person!
5778120	5782120	If that's how you feel about her, why don't you invite someone else?
5782120	5786120	She's my only relative!
5786120	5788120	So invite someone who isn't a relative?
5788120	5792120	Yes, why don't you invite us, for instance?
5792120	5794120	Can one really do things like that?
5794120	5796120	Just like that?
5796120	5798120	Of course one can!
5798120	5800120	Oh, how marvelous!
5800120	5804120	To be perfectly honest, we're very hungry!
5804120	5806120	I've made lots of extra pancakes!
5806120	5808120	Please come in and join me!
5808120	5810120	Thank you!
5810120	5814120	Although we have drifted apart tonight, is midsummer's eve?
5814120	5818120	Let's drink a toast to Mum and Snork Maiden and Little Mai
5818120	5820120	and hope that they're safe!
5820120	5824120	And we better drink to that no-good niece of mine, I guess!
5824120	5826120	Who's that Emma?
5826120	5828120	My only relative!
5828120	5830120	She lives all alone in a small house by the sea!
5830120	5832120	Oh, is she all alone for midsummer?
5832120	5836120	Probably! I always invite me over for pancakes!
5836120	5838120	I don't like relatives and I don't like pancakes!
5838120	5840120	And she's boring, so I don't go!
5840120	5842120	Well, let's toast her anyway!
5842120	5846120	And here's hoping we'll all be together again very soon!
5846120	5848120	Cheers!
5848120	5852120	Oh, that was really good!
5852120	5854120	Everything was delicious!
5854120	5856120	I think I've eaten too much!
5856120	5858120	Oh, please have some more!
5858120	5860120	Oh, this is so nice!
5860120	5862120	I couldn't eat another thing!
5862120	5864120	It's such fun having someone to cook for!
5864120	5866120	I'm so pleased you're not at my door!
5866120	5868120	All that's missing now is a bonfire!
5868120	5872120	We always have one on midsummer eve!
5872120	5874120	What a good idea! Let's have one!
5876120	5877120	Over there!
5878120	5880120	Over there!
5880120	5882120	Over there!
5882120	5884120	Over there!
5884120	5886120	So happy!
5886120	5888120	So glad you came!
5888120	5890120	See these?
5890120	5892120	The flood brought all of them!
5892120	5894120	They were lying all over the place!
5894120	5896120	So I tied them into one big pile!
5896120	5898120	Would they make a good bonfire?
5898120	5900120	Oh, a terrific one!
5900120	5902120	Definitely!
5908120	5910120	Oh, wow!
5928120	5930120	We've walked for miles,
5930120	5932120	but I can't see signs of a theater anywhere!
5932120	5934120	Oh, don't worry! We'll find it soon!
5934120	5936120	Huh?
5936120	5938120	And what's the matter with you?
5938120	5940120	I'm hungry!
5940120	5942120	Me too!
5942120	5944120	I can't walk anymore!
5944120	5946120	We don't have any food if you want food!
5946120	5948120	You'll have to look for yourselves!
5950120	5952120	Oh, don't cry!
5952120	5954120	Look over there, little lion!
5954120	5956120	What?
5956120	5958120	Over there!
5958120	5960120	And the lights are on!
5960120	5962120	We're safe!
5966120	5968120	We're safe!
5968120	5970120	We're safe!
5970120	5972120	We're safe!
5972120	5974120	We're safe!
5974120	5976120	We're safe!
5976120	5978120	We're safe!
5978120	5980120	We're safe!
5980120	5982120	We're safe!
5982120	5984120	Oh!
5984120	5986120	Hey kids!
5986120	5988120	You can't go eating other people's food!
5988120	5990120	You can if they are home,
5990120	5992120	and it's just what's left over from a party!
5992120	5994120	In fact, I will have some myself!
5994120	5996120	It's amazing! I'm always so black!
5996120	5998120	Now we must pick nine flowers!
5998120	6000120	Why is that Snorke-Middon?
6000120	6004120	I don't really know! It's always nine or seven of something!
6004120	6006120	Okay, nine flowers!
6006120	6008120	No, not the same kind!
6008120	6010120	You must pick nine different flowers!
6010120	6012120	And then what do you do?
6012120	6014120	You turn around seven times like this!
6014120	6016120	And then what do you do?
6016120	6018120	You turn around seven times like this!
6018120	6020120	And then what do you do?
6020120	6022120	You turn around seven times like this!
6022120	6024120	And then what do you do?
6024120	6026120	You turn around seven times like this!
6026120	6028120	I get it!
6042120	6046120	And then you walk backward until you reach a well!
6046120	6050120	And then when you look down into the well,
6050120	6054120	there you'll see the man you're going to marry!
6054120	6056120	How did I get him up?
6056120	6060120	I think I see him! What a clever well!
6060120	6062120	That I must try!
6074120	6076120	I'd like someone more romantic!
6076120	6078120	Got you!
6078120	6080120	What are you doing?
6080120	6082120	I'm quietly now!
6082120	6086120	Oh, all we did is pick some unprotected wild flowers!
6086120	6088120	I know what you did!
6088120	6090120	Hey, Snorke-Middon!
6090120	6092120	Moon!
6092120	6094120	Ha! You know each other! That makes it conspiracy!
6094120	6096120	But I tell you, we've done nothing wrong! Nothing at all!
6096120	6098120	We were only celebrating!
6098120	6100120	Better for you, if you hadn't!
6100120	6102120	But why? Can't you light a bonfire here, sir?
6102120	6106120	I must warn you that all you say will be used against you!
6106120	6110120	Yes, yes! I have a complaint from the parkkeeper!
6110120	6112120	You pulled up these signs from his park, and you burnt them!
6112120	6114120	That's not true!
6114120	6118120	It is true that we burnt them, sir, but we didn't take them from any park!
6118120	6120120	They were brought here by the flood!
6120120	6122120	Older-dash! Here's the evidence!
6122120	6126120	I've caught you, and that's that!
6132120	6134120	Oh, I caught something!
6134120	6136120	Oh, it's just a piece of wood!
6136120	6138120	Had any ideas here?
6138120	6140120	Not a single one! How about you, Mama?
6140120	6142120	Same here, I'm afraid!
6142120	6146120	I just can't seem to think of anything at all!
6152120	6156120	You wouldn't have any ideas about what we should do next, would you, Emma?
6156120	6158120	About what?
6158120	6162120	Some ideas about how to let the children know where we are, of course!
6162120	6164120	How does anyone know where a theater is?
6164120	6166120	I don't know!
6166120	6168120	Please tell us!
6168120	6170120	Well, you put on a play!
6170120	6172120	A play?
6172120	6174120	Yes, that is correct!
6174120	6178120	This is a theater, and when you put on a new play, everybody comes flocking to see it!
6178120	6180120	They come to laugh, to cry, to shout, and to applaud!
6180120	6184120	And when your children hear of it, they will be hearing a flash!
6184120	6186120	What a splendid idea, Emma!
6186120	6188120	That's exactly what we'll do!
6188120	6190120	Hmm, I'm sorry, we can't put on a play!
6190120	6192120	Why not?
6192120	6196120	We have no actors! They are pests, but one can't do without them!
6196120	6198120	I can be one!
6198120	6200120	And I'm also quite good at acting!
6200120	6202120	I can act very well!
6202120	6206120	There are only three of you, and not one of you is an experienced professional actor!
6206120	6208120	Don't forget, we have you, Emma!
6208120	6210120	Me?
6210120	6216120	Well, I've always felt that I would make a rather good Shakespearean heroine!
6216120	6220120	And we can each have many parts, as long as they're not all on the stage at the same time!
6220120	6222120	He isn't at so moment, Papa!
6222120	6224120	Of course, it's possible to do it!
6224120	6226120	I want the part that finds the treasure!
6226120	6230120	No, that's impossible, we have no play!
6230120	6232120	Nothing simple enough for the likes of you!
6232120	6236120	A moment, Papa, can write one, he's very talented!
6236120	6240120	No trouble at all, my dear, any number of acts!
6240120	6242120	But we don't want any number, we want three acts!
6242120	6245120	That's what all proper plays always have, moment, Papa!
6245120	6247120	Let's start right away!
6247120	6249120	We got to print posters!
6249120	6251120	And clean the stage!
6251120	6253120	Whatever advice started!
6255120	6261120	And this was how Woman Papa got started on a short career as a playwright!
6275120	6285120	But while the birds carry news of the play far and wide,
6285120	6295120	what has to become of Woman and Snork Maiden?
6295120	6301120	Their troubles are real ones!
6301120	6317120	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements!
6317120	6325120	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements!
6325120	6329120	They're always happy and goes at play!
6329120	6333120	The movements are having fun day after day!
6333120	6337120	The movements!
6337120	6341120	The movements!
6341120	6347120	The movements!
6355120	6365120	Here they are for one and all!
6365120	6375120	The movements are about to come!
6375120	6379120	Come on and sit down here with me!
6379120	6381120	They're for you on your TV!
6381120	6385120	They are the movements!
6385120	6387120	They are the movements!
6387120	6389120	So come with me!
6389120	6391120	Give me your hand!
6391120	6393120	I'll take you up to a moment land!
6393120	6397120	You can fly just like a bird!
6397120	6399120	Sing that song ever!
6399120	6401120	There were the movements!
6401120	6405120	There were the movements!
6405120	6409120	There were the movements!
6409120	6413120	There were the movements!
6413120	6417120	There were the movements!
6423120	6427120	All over moving down, bits of paper were fluttering down!
6427120	6429120	What are you sewing?
6429120	6431120	How are you sewing?
6431120	6433120	Let us know!
6433120	6437120	They were even falling over the lake!
6437120	6441120	What's this?
6441120	6443120	Oh, litter!
6443120	6445120	There's some writing on that piece of paper!
6445120	6447120	I think it's a message!
6447120	6449120	Let's see!
6449120	6453120	Moment, theatre presents, written by Moment Papa!
6453120	6455120	Moment, Papa!
6455120	6457120	The last children of Moment Valley!
6457120	6461120	Starring Moment Papa, Moment Mama, and Sniff!
6461120	6463120	And introducing Emma!
6463120	6465120	Emma?
6465120	6467120	It works in a theatre!
6467120	6469120	Admission fee!
6469120	6471120	Anything edible!
6471120	6473120	They're putting on a play!
6473120	6477120	So they can't be lost!
6477120	6479120	I haven't seen a play since I was a kid!
6479120	6481120	It was wonderful!
6481120	6483120	The best play ever!
6483120	6485120	All about a princess!
6485120	6487120	She fell asleep in a rose bush!
6487120	6489120	She was so lovely!
6489120	6491120	I've got to see that one again!
6491120	6493120	But who will guard my prisoners, I wonder?
6493120	6495120	I'm a good idea, officer!
6495120	6499120	You could take the three of us with you to the theatre to see the play!
6499120	6501120	Good idea!
6501120	6503120	We love the theatre, so we won't try to run away, officer!
6503120	6505120	I promise!
6505120	6507120	Hmm, not possible!
6507120	6509120	I won't let you out of this jail until you write out!
6509120	6513120	It's forbidden to burn signs 5,000 times each!
6513120	6515120	That's the punishment for vandals!
6515120	6519120	Well, in that case, you won't be able to see the play!
6519120	6521120	Ah, who cares?
6521120	6523120	I'll go!
6523120	6525120	Yes, I must see it, I must go!
6525120	6527120	So you'll take us with you?
6527120	6529120	No, you stay right here!
6529120	6531120	Well, then you can't go either, officer!
6531120	6533120	Quiet! You're upsetting me!
6533120	6537120	No, no! This isn't good enough! It's not true drama!
6537120	6539120	Ah, please, moment, papa!
6539120	6541120	I don't want to be just a lion's ugly behind!
6541120	6543120	But, Sniff, I did give you another part!
6543120	6545120	I don't want to be a baby either!
6545120	6549120	And she said you wanted parts without lines!
6549120	6551120	You're the dusting a bit later, Emma, please!
6551120	6553120	He's script should be ready now!
6553120	6557120	We have to start practicing for the opening night tomorrow morning!
6557120	6559120	Don't worry, Emma, it's coming along!
6559120	6561120	I'm only half done!
6561120	6563120	I shall never get ready in time, moment, mama!
6563120	6565120	You're right to worry!
6565120	6567120	For the curtain will rise tomorrow, no matter what!
6567120	6569120	Ha, ha, ha!
6569120	6573120	Women papa will remember to give Emma lots and lots of lines!
6573120	6577120	She's really looking forward to her first performance!
6577120	6581120	Now, leave me, I must be left alone to concentrate!
6581120	6583120	The writer needs peace and quiet!
6583120	6587120	There are some things I don't like about this script!
6587120	6589120	I'll discuss it with you after the performance, Sniff!
6589120	6591120	After!
6591120	6595120	If it's a story about lost children, why do you have to have a stupid lion?
6595120	6599120	I'm too good an actor to be cast as a lion!
6599120	6601120	Keith, I'm out of my hair!
6601120	6603120	He's giving me a headache!
6603120	6605120	You come with me, Sniff! We'll practice our parts!
6605120	6609120	This could be a wonderful play if you'd only skip the lions behind!
6609120	6613120	I've heard enough about this behind!
6613120	6617120	Remember, we have a lion's head too, dying to show his acting skills on the stage!
6617120	6621120	This is my play, and I refuse to write out the lion's butt!
6621120	6623120	I refuse!
6626120	6630120	Here's the key! I want you to keep a keen eye on them until I come back!
6630120	6632120	Do you understand me, cousin?
6632120	6634120	Are they very dangerous?
6634120	6638120	Yes, they certainly are! They bite if you let them out!
6638120	6640120	We certainly wouldn't bite anyone, obviously!
6640120	6642120	I've had enough of your lies!
6642120	6644120	Don't listen to my dear cousin, they do!
6644120	6648120	Well then, now I'm up to the theater to see the play!
6648120	6650120	Take good care of them while I'm gone!
6650120	6652120	Excuse me! You seem to be a very good knitter!
6652120	6654120	Oh, thank you!
6654120	6656120	Nobody ever said that to me before! I enjoy it!
6656120	6658120	What are you making?
6658120	6660120	I'm not sure! I don't really know!
6660120	6662120	Nothing in particular!
6662120	6664120	It's just that, knitting!
6664120	6666120	I'm not sure!
6666120	6668120	I'm not sure!
6668120	6670120	I'm not sure!
6670120	6672120	I'm not sure!
6672120	6674120	I'm not sure!
6674120	6676120	I don't really know!
6676120	6678120	Nothing in particular!
6678120	6682120	It's just that knitting is so reassuring somehow!
6682120	6685120	Nothing bad can happen while you knit, can it?
6685120	6690120	The trouble is I always seem to forget to decide what to make before I start!
6690120	6695120	But it feels nice and warm and I love the color!
6695120	6698120	Couldn't you make socks? It's a very nice sock color!
6698120	6700120	Socks?
6700120	6703120	Yes, it's very, very cold in here!
6703120	6707120	Oh, yes! That's a very good idea!
6708120	6712120	Listen, if I knitted each one of you a pair of warm socks,
6712120	6714120	would you really put them on?
6714120	6715120	Of course!
6715120	6716120	Of course!
6716120	6717120	That would be nice!
6717120	6719120	I'm almost freezing to death in here!
6719120	6721120	It's so very, very cold!
6721120	6723120	Is it really that cold?
6723120	6725120	Yes! My teeth are chattery!
6725120	6726120	So I could hardly talk!
6726120	6728120	Honestly!
6728120	6730120	Oh, dear, dear!
6730120	6732120	What should I do?
6732120	6736120	Maybe some steaming hot black currant juice would help to warm us up a little?
6737120	6741120	Possibly, although it might already be too late!
6757120	6761120	My cousin would be very angry with me if he knew, but I think...
6761120	6763120	But you think why?
6763120	6767120	I think I'll let you out so that we can all be nice and warm indoors!
6767120	6768120	Really?
6771120	6774120	Don't cry now, baby!
6774120	6776120	That's a good boy!
6776120	6780120	Don't cry, honey! That's enough, baby!
6784120	6786120	Whoa!
6786120	6790120	Oh, woman mama, you need to show much more emotion!
6790120	6793120	Try to be more motherly and more loving!
6793120	6796120	Listen to her, this is a very happy baby!
6796120	6798120	How am I doing, woman papa?
6798120	6802120	You're just perfect for the part sniffing your performance was excellent!
6802120	6804120	Whoa!
6804120	6807120	Maybe I should add a part with some lines in it!
6807120	6809120	Whoa!
6809120	6811120	Whoa!
6812120	6814120	Whoa!
6820120	6824120	Look at these! I think they might be ready by now!
6824120	6827120	I hope they're tasty! They don't always come out very well!
6827120	6830120	You're so kind! We've had so much already!
6830120	6832120	But they smell really delicious!
6832120	6834120	They sure do!
6834120	6835120	Thank you so much!
6835120	6837120	Now I feel warm again!
6837120	6839120	How about some more black currant juice?
6839120	6841120	Or maybe one of these freshly baked cookies?
6841120	6843120	It's very kind of you, but no thank you!
6843120	6846120	I couldn't eat another thing I'm so full up!
6846120	6848120	Me too!
6848120	6851120	Oh dear, the party is over then!
6851120	6854120	I'm afraid so!
6854120	6857120	It's really sad, but I have to lock you up again!
6857120	6859120	But at least I know you're warm in there!
6859120	6864120	We're really sorry too, but you don't need to worry because actually we're not going back to jail!
6864120	6866120	Oh, aren't you?
6866120	6870120	We've got other plans! We're going to the theatre! You see my parents play!
6870120	6874120	And I suppose I should say hello to my Aunt Emma, who works there!
6874120	6879120	Oh, what shall I do? My cousin will be very cross with me!
6879120	6883120	But you see, we're innocent! We didn't do anything wrong!
6883120	6884120	You didn't?
6884120	6886120	I swear it!
6886120	6889120	Do I look like someone who pulls up signs in a park?
6889120	6892120	We just burned some flats and left by the flood!
6892120	6894120	But your cousin wouldn't believe it!
6894120	6897120	He jumped to conclusions, wrongful arrest!
6897120	6899120	That's all it was!
6899120	6902120	Oh dear, why didn't you tell me that it was?
6902120	6906120	Ah, people shouldn't go to jail when they haven't done anything wrong!
6906120	6909120	Ah, so we can go to the theatre, is that okay?
6909120	6911120	Of course, better leave right away!
6911120	6915120	My cousin will be very disappointed, but I guess I can't be helped!
6915120	6917120	Wait for me!
6917120	6923120	I think I'd better come along and explain to that cousin of mine that his three prisoners are innocent of the charge against them!
6923120	6929120	That's all right, all right, bring it in!
6929120	6932120	Eh, that's right, Mum! Papa, stop there!
6932120	6933120	Okay, sniff!
6933120	6936120	Mum and Mama, what have you got there?
6936120	6939120	A baby's crib! I want to use this in the play!
6939120	6941120	If that's all right with you!
6941120	6943120	Mum and Papa! Mum and Papa!
6943120	6946120	I've just read your script and I think you have a big problem!
6946120	6950120	Who is going to pay the parts of Mum and Snork Maiden in this play of yours?
6951120	6955120	I don't know yet, we don't have any more children and Sniff can't take the part!
6955120	6957120	Are you utterly mad?
6957120	6962120	We only have a few hours before the curtain goes up and you don't even have actors for all the part!
6962120	6964120	What kind of director is that?
6964120	6967120	Maybe one of us could stand behind something and sort of read their lines!
6967120	6969120	Wait, thank you! I did it!
6969120	6971120	Let's hope the credits are proud!
6976120	6978120	Hold on tight, all of you!
6979120	6980120	No!
6983120	6988120	Listen kids, you can be as noisy as you like out here but once we're at the dinner you have to be quiet!
6988120	6990120	You understand me right?
7009120	7011120	The audience is waiting for us!
7026120	7033120	Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for giving up your valuable time in order to come to our show tonight!
7033120	7036120	The world premiere of the Lost Children!
7036120	7039120	This is a brand new company and the players never been performed before!
7039120	7043120	Ladies and gentlemen, sit back and enjoy the superb acting!
7043120	7044120	What's that?
7044120	7046120	A baby's cradle, it's for you Sniff!
7046120	7047120	For me?
7047120	7051120	We sincerely hope you'll be thrilled by the originality of the plot!
7051120	7054120	And so now dear friends, let's get started!
7054120	7056120	Let's get started!
7059120	7060120	Come on!
7062120	7064120	Come on, come on!
7064120	7066120	Oh, thank you, gentlemen!
7068120	7071120	There's a good boy, don't cry honey!
7071120	7073120	Please, don't cry!
7074120	7079120	Hmm, oh, moment, snork maiden, my darling children!
7079120	7083120	You've been lost for a whole month and we haven't heard a word from either of you!
7083120	7085120	Oh, he's forgotten all about me!
7085120	7086120	Shh!
7087120	7092120	I'd give the whole world to be rid of this most terrible agonizing despair!
7092120	7100120	Oh, I'll make your husband try not to fret, so I'm sure he'll be back before very long!
7100120	7103120	Little children, come and free me from this plight!
7103120	7107120	Your mother worries all day through the baby's awake all night!
7107120	7110120	Come home, come home, my children too!
7110120	7113120	With all our hearts, we're missing you!
7116120	7117120	Hmm?
7117120	7119120	Loud or Sniff?
7119120	7121120	Oh, well, mama!
7121120	7123120	But what's wrong with you, Sniff?
7123120	7125120	This rocket's making me sick!
7125120	7128120	Oh dear, and right in the middle of movement, Papa's play!
7128120	7130120	Oh, oh!
7130120	7134120	Mama, let us set forth and find our loved ones!
7134120	7137120	We cannot leave our baby here!
7137120	7140120	Oh, anyone would love to have him sweet little thing!
7140120	7143120	For how long, pray, do you think we would be gone?
7143120	7148120	For as long as it takes, I can no longer stand being this frightfully upset about my children!
7149120	7151120	Oh, baby!
7153120	7154120	Yeah!
7160120	7162120	Hurry up, Sniff!
7162120	7164120	I'm trying!
7165120	7168120	Hurry, scene two is about to start!
7168120	7171120	Help me, somebody! I can't get out of here!
7171120	7173120	When do they put the princess on?
7173120	7175120	We still have very far to go.
7175120	7177120	I'm afraid so hurry, movement!
7177120	7178120	I am hurrying!
7178120	7179120	It's for bitten!
7179120	7180120	It's for bitten!
7180120	7181120	It's for bitten!
7181120	7182120	It's for bitten!
7182120	7184120	What are you writing on that paper?
7184120	7186120	My cousin won't give up, I'm sure!
7186120	7188120	So I better write this 5,000 times!
7188120	7189120	It's for bitten!
7189120	7190120	It's for bitten!
7190120	7191120	It's for bitten!
7191120	7192120	It's for bitten!
7195120	7197120	A full two weeks has passed!
7197120	7199120	Oh, what shall we do?
7199120	7203120	Our dear children have disappeared from the face of the Earth!
7203120	7206120	Oh, what happened, dear Apple, of my heart?
7207120	7210120	I think I sprained my hands really badly.
7210120	7211120	Oh, it hurts!
7211120	7215120	If you were in trouble, apart from the wolves, we're all alone!
7215120	7216120	I'll put you out!
7216120	7218120	Stop!
7218120	7219120	Stop!
7219120	7221120	Why must this happen in my theater?
7221120	7223120	I've been squeezed in here to make me look smaller!
7223120	7224120	Help!
7224120	7225120	I'm trying to!
7225120	7227120	We can't have the lion on stage without his behind!
7227120	7229120	Wow!
7229120	7230120	I'm so new!
7230120	7231120	Come on!
7231120	7232120	Wow!
7232120	7233120	Wow!
7233120	7238120	We have to face the worst and spend the night right here in the wilderness!
7238120	7240120	Dear husband, will it be all right?
7240120	7243120	Fairly in these unhulled woods, I feel quite greasy!
7245120	7250120	Sweet wife, I too can smell those frightful beasts, howling for a blood!
7250120	7253120	May not just smell them, dear!
7253120	7255120	Anything that I can hear them now!
7258120	7260120	I can hear the howling of those hungry beasts!
7261120	7263120	Wow!
7263120	7267120	Paint is the roar, but I can make it out a lion!
7267120	7268120	Wow!
7268120	7270120	Oh!
7273120	7276120	Oh, sniff, what's up?
7276120	7278120	Where are you going, dear?
7278120	7286120	Oh, listen, I have to go and stop that stupid lion who's roaming around the countryside watching our every move.
7286120	7290120	Hey, don't worry, I'll be right back, my dear.
7290120	7292120	Was he supposed to say that?
7292120	7295120	Hey, what are you doing here, you're supposed to be on stage?
7295120	7298120	It's not my father, he's stuck in his crib!
7298120	7301120	Woman mama stuck on stage, raw lion!
7304120	7308120	That lion sounds very close, my husband must be in great danger!
7308120	7310120	All right, under that stage, both of you.
7315120	7318120	Papa, I can't get this thing off, I feel sick!
7321120	7323120	Ah, what are you doing, woman papa?
7323120	7325120	You can do it with a cradle on, sniff.
7325120	7330120	No, I can't stop it, please don't do it, woman papa, laugh at me out there!
7330120	7334120	Don't worry, nobody knows it's you hiding in there.
7334120	7336120	Come on now, hurry!
7339120	7343120	Ah, lion, a lion is this to be my most untimely end?
7350120	7353120	Don't you dare laugh at me!
7358120	7361120	Whoa, is that lion gonna eat, woman mama?
7362120	7364120	Oh no, what might you do?
7364120	7366120	What should I do, woman papa?
7366120	7368120	I'm scared, can't be bothered to pee!
7368120	7371120	Just run off across the stage, dear!
7371120	7373120	We were supposed to run off together!
7373120	7378120	The situation has changed, I'll have to come to your rescue some other time, dear!
7378120	7381120	Oh, help me out!
7384120	7387120	Oh, help me so much, please!
7387120	7390120	Please, hold out, everyone!
7390120	7392120	I can't really see it!
7400120	7402120	Help me, please!
7402120	7405120	Someone, come quickly before I get killed!
7405120	7406120	Oh!
7406120	7409120	Help me, woman mama!
7413120	7415120	Help me!
7420120	7422120	Oh, it's only snap!
7422120	7425120	Little Maya, I'm so glad you're all right!
7425120	7428120	Shirley, weren't worried about me, woman mama?
7428120	7432120	Well, just a little maybe, but you're such a lucky girl, I knew you'd manage.
7432120	7433120	Mama!
7433120	7434120	Mama!
7434120	7435120	I don't believe it!
7435120	7436120	Mama!
7436120	7437120	It's me, woman!
7437120	7439120	And it's me snorting me in!
7439120	7440120	Mama!
7440120	7441120	Papa!
7441120	7443120	Moments snorting me in!
7443120	7445120	Is it really you?
7445120	7447120	Come here and let me see you!
7450120	7452120	We've come back, mama!
7452120	7454120	I was dying to see you!
7454120	7456120	Oh, it's wonderful to have you back!
7456120	7458120	Isn't that my niece?
7458120	7460120	And Emma!
7460120	7461120	Oh!
7461120	7463120	You look so grown up!
7464120	7468120	And Emma, so sorry to have missed your show, but I have so much to tell you!
7471120	7472120	Hi, everybody!
7472120	7474120	That was a great performance!
7474120	7476120	Snortkin, I'm so glad to see you!
7476120	7477120	Glad you're safe, woman!
7477120	7478120	Help me!
7478120	7479120	Hey!
7480120	7481120	Those are my prisoners!
7481120	7483120	They've escaped from jail!
7483120	7484120	Catch them!
7486120	7487120	No, cousin!
7487120	7490120	I let them out because they swear they're innocent!
7490120	7493120	They didn't pull up a single one of those signs!
7493120	7494120	That's right!
7494120	7496120	I was the one who did that deliberately!
7496120	7498120	And I helped him!
7498120	7499120	Very well!
7499120	7500120	You're both under arrest!
7500120	7501120	No!
7501120	7502120	No!
7502120	7504120	No!
7504120	7506120	Who are these dreadful children?
7506120	7507120	Dear, dear cousin.
7509120	7511120	It's forbidden, it's forbidden.
7511120	7514120	Five thousand times, that's what you wanted.
7514120	7516120	And are you sure there are five thousand?
7516120	7517120	Oh, yes, quite sure.
7517120	7519120	I've counted them.
7520120	7522120	One, two, three, four.
7522120	7524120	Now that we are all together again,
7524120	7527120	I would really like to go back to Moomin Valley.
7527120	7529120	What shall we do with all these little pests?
7529120	7530120	Snortkin?
7530120	7531120	Well, little Mai.
7531120	7533120	Someone might like to foster them.
7534120	7536120	You can leave them in my car, sir.
7536120	7538120	And yours, Emma?
7538120	7539120	Yes!
7539120	7541120	Now I have some acting experience.
7541120	7543120	I think I would like to start an acting school,
7543120	7545120	exactly what this theater needs.
7545120	7546120	What a good idea!
7546120	7548120	Do you think I would be too old to attend?
7548120	7550120	Perhaps character parts.
7550120	7551120	Like in my play.
7551120	7554120	All is arranged for the best, so now we can go home.
7554120	7557120	It is Moomin Papa, I think it's high time.
7557120	7560120	Quiet, please, I've lost my cap.
7560120	7563120	Now I'll have to start again right from the beginning.
7563120	7566120	Moomin Papa, do you think we should thank the audience
7566120	7569120	for their patience because they're still watching us, you know?
7570120	7572120	No, you're right.
7574120	7576120	Ladies and gentlemen, that's all for tonight.
7576120	7579120	I hope you have enjoyed the performance.
7579120	7583120	I think it was very kind of you to stay to the very end.
7595120	7598120	Sometimes I could almost believe the truth is strange
7598120	7600120	or the fiction of it.
7600120	7602120	Well, it is, isn't it, Moomin Papa?
7603120	7606120	No, not really, we writers are no better.
7606120	7608120	Go write more plays.
7608120	7611120	Oh, what a very good idea, Moomin Papa.
7611120	7614120	I think you're as good with plays as you are with memoirs.
7614120	7615120	What are you two?
7615120	7619120	Right, I'll start on the sequel as soon as we're all back home.
7623120	7625120	There it is, I lovely home.
7625120	7627120	At least I got a proper wash.
7627120	7629120	I've never seen it so clean.
7629120	7630120	What about in sign?
7630120	7633120	Oh, redecorated, probably.
7633120	7634120	Yeah.
7634120	7635120	Let's go.
7635120	7638120	The Moomin family spent the whole of the following week
7638120	7640120	making their house cozy and comfortable.
7640120	7643120	And soon each carpet, each cup and saucer
7643120	7647120	and every piece of furniture was back in its proper place once again.
7660120	7665120	No caring and giving the Moomin's.
7665120	7669120	They're always happy and goes at play.
7669120	7672120	The Moomin's are having fun day after day.
7672120	7676120	The Moomin's.
7676120	7680120	The Moomin's.
7680120	7685120	The Moomin's.
7690120	7695120	The Moomin's.
7721120	7725120	The Moomin's.
7725120	7728120	They are the Moomin's.
7728120	7731120	So come with me, give me your hand.
7731120	7734120	I'll take you up to Moomin land.
7734120	7737120	You can fly just like a bird.
7737120	7740120	Sing that song ever.
7740120	7745120	There were the Moomin's.
7745120	7749120	There were the Moomin's.
7749120	7754120	There were the Moomin's.
7754120	7758120	Bop, bop, bop, bop.
7763120	7768120	One night, Moomin was having a dream.
7768120	7772120	What a wonderful feeling to be flying like this.
7772120	7774120	Look over there, Moomin.
7774120	7776120	What a beautiful lake.
7776120	7780120	It's one of the most fantastic experiences I've ever had.
7780120	7781120	Me too.
7781120	7784120	I never knew birds had such a marvelous life.
7784120	7788120	Seeing things from a completely different point of view.
7788120	7791120	We're flying pretty high, aren't we?
7791120	7793120	I'm scared.
7793120	7795120	We're much too high.
7795120	7799120	Let's go down, please. Let's go down at once.
7799120	7803120	I'm not scared of heights.
7803120	7807120	You know, aren't this time you really have succeeded?
7807120	7811120	Well, I could build hundreds of these if you wanted me to.
7811120	7814120	Snork, can I steer just for a little while?
7814120	7816120	Now you can.
7816120	7818120	Oh, thank you.
7818120	7823120	Do you really know how to steer this thing?
7823120	7827120	Hey, stop it, stinky.
7827120	7830120	That's dangerous.
7833120	7836120	This is okay.
7836120	7840120	Really? It's just a dream.
7860120	7862120	Oh gosh, my head hurt so much.
7863120	7865120	What a strange dream.
7865120	7868120	Why would my brother let stinky steer his flying ship?
7868120	7870120	Surely not.
7870120	7873120	I was talking to the snork while I looked away.
7873120	7875120	Suddenly stinky took his place.
7875120	7877120	Oh, and then the thing began tilting.
7877120	7880120	Hmm, but it was just a dream.
7880120	7882120	I don't care. I don't like it.
7882120	7885120	You shouldn't have dreams like that just when my brother's flying ship is almost ready.
7885120	7888120	Dreams often come true, you know.
7888120	7891120	But it was nothing like the ship your brother's building.
7891120	7893120	It was totally different.
7893120	7895120	But tell me what happened to it in the end.
7895120	7897120	Did it fall down?
7897120	7898120	I don't know.
7898120	7901120	I lost sight of it when I fell off and I didn't see it again.
7901120	7904120	Well, surely you could have turned your head to take a look.
7904120	7906120	Well, I didn't.
7906120	7909120	Listen, moment, don't say a word to the snork about this.
7909120	7912120	He's nervous enough as it is.
7912120	7913120	Of course not.
7913120	7915120	Why don't we just forget about it?
7915120	7917120	Pretend it never happened, eh?
7918120	7921120	Oh, snork, it's finally completed.
7921120	7924120	Sure it is. But it hasn't been flown yet, of course.
7924120	7926120	But it will. I won't snork.
7926120	7928120	You don't think there's anything wrong with it?
7928120	7930120	Of course not. But it's just...
7930120	7932120	Is there some problem, snork?
7932120	7934120	Well, there might be.
7934120	7936120	So, what is it?
7936120	7937120	Fuel.
7937120	7938120	Fuel?
7938120	7941120	But you said you had developed a new fuel that was really good.
7941120	7943120	It's good.
7943120	7947120	But you see, you see, it might not be powerful enough.
7947120	7950120	You mean it might not be able to fly?
7950120	7952120	No, it won't. You're quite right.
7952120	7956120	Or it will just be an ordinary ship, not a flying ship.
7956120	7960120	Oh, that would be nice. What can't go up can't possibly fall down.
7960120	7966120	But that's not the point if it won't fly. Everyone will laugh at me. I know they will.
7966120	7968120	I won't laugh, I promise.
7968120	7970120	Maybe not. Others will.
7970120	7975120	But you wouldn't care about that, would you? Who cares what other people think?
7975120	7980120	The thing is, I've already told people that the test flight will be quite soon in public.
7980120	7985120	But I'm sure people will be very nice about it, even if it doesn't get off the ground.
7985120	7988120	That's hardly what I want.
7988120	7991120	Moomin, I'd like to ask you a favor.
7991120	7994120	That's why I sent for you. Will you help me?
7994120	7997120	I'll do anything. You ask snork, of course.
7997120	8001120	What I would like is for you, Moomin, my friend, to be test pilot for me tomorrow.
8001120	8004120	You want me to be a pilot?
8004120	8034120	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
8034120	8064120	Oh, moment! Listen, Stinky, I'm going to steer that ship. Is that perfectly clear? You're not to touch the wheel. I'm a pilot now. What on earth was that about? Wouldn't you find it difficult to steer it? Oh, no, it's real easy. But of course, I'd need to practice before the public demonstration. Is the snorke going to fly his own ship?
8064120	8094120	He has to stay down in the engine room, Snuffkin. I wonder if this ship will really fly. The only problem is the fuel. Only the fuel you say. That's a big problem. I suppose so. Listen, moment. Suppose now the snorke's flying ship really gets off the ground. Well, of course, it's going to, Papa. That something could happen. Something could break or you could fall into an air pocket. It's such a dangerous undertaking. Think, moment.
8094120	8124120	Now listen, it's not natural for moments to fly about up in the air. Is it snuffkin? Quite right. What would you and the snorke do if things went wrong? We will be wearing parachutes, you know? Parachutes. You do know what they are, don't you, Papa? Of course I do. They come down from the sky like this, like this. Exactly. But of course, we won't need a parachute. Because nothing will go wrong. And I will be the first flying ship pilot.
8124120	8154120	Whatever. Oh. Hi there. Hello, my young man. Hello. How do you do? How do you do everybody? Hello, sir. I wonder if you can help me. Do you happen to know where the snorke's factory is? You mean the ship? I must see him. I'm most eager to have a look at his famous flying ship. How do you know about that? It's supposed to be very secret. The information must have leaked out somehow.
8154120	8184120	Oh well. All inventors know about what he is trying to do. He's famous throughout Moomin Valley this snorke. Really? Are you an inventor, too? Indeed I am. One of the more famous. I think maybe the most famous of them all. I am Moomin Papa. How do you do, sir? I'm snuffkin. And my name is Moomin. Please to meet you. A very good day to you, one and all. The muffles, my name.
8184120	8214120	I said I'm the muffle. You mean you've never even heard of me the most famous inventor? Oh yes, I'm sure I am. The muffle isn't it? Yes, it is the muffle. Have you invented anything exciting, muffle, Mr. Muffle? I would be much easier to tell you what I haven't invented, young man. For instance, the pin that can't prick because it has two heads. The newspaper that reads itself the purse that moans and greets me.
8214120	8244080	The bronze, if you take money from it, the adhesive tape that sticks only to itself. This is perhaps the greatest of all my latest inventions. Whatever is that? This is proper self a man-powered fan. Infanible in Moomin Valley. All these are my latest inventions.
8244120	8273080	You didn't know that, did you? No, it isn't. But try and get a handkerchief, the square balloon, the five-wheel car, the hexagonal frying pan, the seven-hole button, and a host of others. Indeed, how interesting. What did you want to see the snork about? I thought I might be able to help him out with one of my inventions. That's what? Oh, dear, which one? My new? No, it's very top-sequence stuff I can't tell you.
8273560	8287800	Now, where is the snork's factory? I'll take you right there. Very kind of you. Come, he'll be so surprised. Must be off, see you again. It's a pleasure to help these buddy-inventors. Snork will be so excited.
8287800	8301240	A famous inventor, eh? What is your opinion, Snuffkin? Have you ever seen a triangular handkerchief, Moomin Papa? No, when I don't want to either. I do wonder what he's cooked up for the snork, though.
8301240	8311720	It is sort of intriguing. Yes, indeed. Moomin will be able to tell us later, I suppose. Yes, but anything could happen before then. Can we wait that long, Snuffkin? You're right.
8315720	8318360	No, wait for me. I'm coming with you.
8322600	8327560	Oh, I thought we had several guests. Now, where in the world are they all gone?
8331240	8333240	Hmm?
8337240	8339240	Hmm?
8343240	8347240	Now, where are they off to, I wonder?
8353240	8355240	Oh, look who's coming!
8361240	8363240	What are you doing here?
8363240	8368240	We're just interested, then. Where are the muffle and the snork?
8368240	8373240	The snork and the muffle are discussing some top-secret project. It's very harsh.
8373240	8379240	Not a triangular handkerchief, I hope. I don't know, Papa. As I said, it's top-secret.
8379240	8381240	Let's see.
8383240	8387240	Oh, bother. The curtains in the way, so I can't see a thing.
8387240	8401240	So this is the powerful fuel you've developed, is it, Mr. Muffle? Yes, it is. Not as original as my other inventions, I admit. But very useful. Yes, useful. I call it Super Fuel.
8401240	8405240	Only trouble is my engine has been designed for liquid fuel.
8405240	8414240	No problem at all, young man. If you dissolve this block of fuel in 10 litres of water, your engine will run for at least 10 hours.
8414240	8418240	For 10 whole hours? That's incredible.
8418240	8424240	If you doubt the word of the muffle, then try it out and see for yourself right now. Right now?
8424240	8431240	Better still, I guarantee that if used as it is in a solid state, your engine will run not for 10, but for 100 hours.
8431240	8441240	100 hours? But that's incredible. You really must be some inventor. Indeed, if what you say is true, it would solve the last problem of my flying ship.
8441240	8448240	Oh, now that I've looked more closely at the padlock, this store isn't locked. No, it isn't.
8448240	8454240	So if one wanted to see the snorke, one could work right here. But why would you want to see him, Papa?
8454240	8462240	Well, why don't you tell us? I don't want snorke falling for one of the muffles crazy ideas, that's why.
8462240	8468240	Well, we'll find out pretty soon. Maybe you don't realise it, but the snorke is pretty clever, you know.
8469240	8475240	I think I know exactly what they're doing in there. Yeah, what?
8475240	8481240	I saw that man pouring something into the flying ship. What was it? Well, I guess it must have been fuel, movement.
8481240	8487240	Well, how come you saw him? There's a crack that's just about wide enough for me. But I won't tell you where.
8487240	8495240	What are those two in there talking about? Oh, yeah. So this is the great super fuel? Wait a minute, snorke. There must be something wrong with it.
8496240	8503240	What the hell is that? What the hell? There you are. Solid fuel indeed, huh? 100 hours? You're an imposter, sir.
8503240	8511240	Oh, it isn't true, if you just let me explain. No, thank you. I know very well why you came over here with that ridiculous story.
8511240	8520240	Off with you right now. Listen to me. It is not ridiculous, and it is not just a story. Maybe we shouldn't have dissolved it in the water.
8521240	8529240	That was a mistake. Imposter, but I'm the muffler. I don't care. Maybe it's just a misunderstanding and the fuel isn't suited for flying ships.
8529240	8536240	Wrong, it suits everything. Forget the fuel. That was just a trick so he could come here and get to see my flying ship.
8536240	8544240	So the muffler has come here to spy, you mean? Ridiculous. I don't steal. Papa, was there anything you wanted to see me about?
8545240	8551240	No, I just dropped by. No cause for excitement. The fuels are done.
8551240	8556240	No, it's not. That's not true. I don't invent guns. What would be the point of inventing them?
8556240	8560240	Oh, listen to me, please. Let's try and use the fuel once more.
8560240	8566240	No, thanks. Once was once too many. I'll have to clean my tanks from your gunge. Get out of my sight.
8575240	8581240	Oh dear, this must have been a bit of a disappointment for the snork. I know.
8589240	8594240	Now listen, stinky. I'm doing this for the snork sake, isn't that so?
8594240	8599240	I don't care if you're doing it for all I want is to get a good look at the famous flying ship.
8599240	8606240	You'd need something very powerful to get a thing like that off the ground. Something so powerful that only I, the muffler, could ever have invented it.
8606240	8610240	Remind me one day to show you my famous triangular handkerchief.
8610240	8615240	Now all we have to do is not dissolve the fuel in water but use the solid fuel.
8615240	8619240	Hurry up with that lock, stinky or maybe I should invent a lock pick.
8619240	8623240	Come on, stinky. Hurry, hurry.
8623240	8625240	There you are done.
8625240	8627240	Good, come. We don't have much time.
8627240	8631240	No, I'm dying to steer this ship.
8631240	8635240	Me up. Take it up to 2,000 meters.
8635240	8638240	Yeah.
8638240	8643240	Oh, stinky, stinky. We're flying at a height of just over 2,000 meters now.
8643240	8645240	Stinky. Yeah, I'm listening. What is it?
8645240	8650240	When you hear me say now, that's when I want you to start off the engine immediately.
8650240	8653240	All right, no problem. I guess it must be this one.
8653240	8655240	No, no, not yet. This is it.
8655240	8658240	Just a drop of water on the fuel block.
8658240	8660240	Now that you do it.
8660240	8662240	Can I start it now?
8662240	8665240	Not yet. All right.
8668240	8671240	Now, start off the engine stinky.
8671240	8674240	Die, answer.
8674240	8678240	Did you really turn on the switch? Yes, I did.
8679240	8683240	The engine won't start. Are you quite sure you turned the one I pointed out to you?
8683240	8686240	I think so. Maybe I turned the wrong one.
8686240	8688240	There. Outside these two as well.
8688240	8690240	Come on, stinky. This is no joke.
8690240	8693240	My reputation as a famous inventor is at stake.
8693240	8697240	This should do it, I think. Is that work, Mr. Mapple?
8697240	8701240	Nothing is happening. I knew I shouldn't have let you do it better to do it myself.
8701240	8706240	You're useless. Like Mr. Mapple, I haven't tried the very last one in the row.
8706240	8708240	This one switched left. What?
8708240	8712240	I better throw that one too. You never know. It might just do the trick.
8720240	8724240	It works. It works. I know it works. I know it works.
8724240	8726240	It is working.
8736240	8740240	I'm not surprised, but I'm so pleased with myself.
8740240	8746240	You should be here, Snork. This is my great moment. You should be here to share it with me.
8746240	8750240	Come on, I can't wait to drive this thing.
8753240	8757240	Incredible. This ship shall rise like a Phoenix.
8757240	8761240	Not the most demanding engine, but this is one of my diesel inventions.
8767240	8772240	Pass that! Come on! Wait for it!
8781240	8785240	Come on, let me go! Come on!
8788240	8792240	This is your power. I don't think engine has started up.
8792240	8795240	I'm very much afraid it's exploding.
8797240	8799240	He's thinking engines exploding.
8799240	8801240	Where is the back of the ship?
8801240	8805240	It's going to explode any minute by wonderful invention.
8827240	8829240	I don't know.
8845240	8849240	Now come to your nice room on the small side, but the very best one.
8849240	8853240	That explosion. It really was most unexpected, officer.
8854240	8858240	Everybody knows you're a great inventor. I wonder if you could help me, Mr. Muffle.
8858240	8859240	But how?
8859240	8863240	Could you think of something to protect my roses while you're staying with us?
8863240	8865240	A non-explosive, of course.
8865240	8866240	Of course I could.
8866240	8868240	Piece of cake, officer.
8870240	8873240	Oh, I really did want to fly.
8875240	8878240	Come, come now. Cheer up, Snork dear.
8878240	8881240	Here you are, a nice cup of tea.
8881240	8882240	Thanks.
8884240	8888240	It's very strange, but I had a dream the other night about a flying ship.
8888240	8892240	Did you really move in? That sounds very interesting.
8892240	8894240	Yes, very interesting.
8894240	8896240	Moment, tell me about it.
8896240	8901240	Yes, it was a peculiar looking ship totally different from your flying ship, Snork.
8901240	8903240	Different? How?
8903240	8907240	Well, it was sort of round like this.
8907240	8911240	It had a propeller and something hanging underneath.
8912240	8914240	And we flew over high mountain.
8915240	8916240	Round?
8916240	8917240	Yes.
8917240	8920240	And you were in a sort of thing hanging underneath.
8920240	8921240	Yes.
8921240	8922240	Round.
8922240	8924240	Round, huh?
8926240	8927240	Round.
8929240	8931240	What if it's the matter, Snork?
8931240	8932240	What?
8932240	8935240	Oh, mama, thanks for the tea.
8935240	8937240	I think I'm getting a new idea.
8937240	8939240	Moment, see you later.
8939240	8941240	Papa, I must go.
8941240	8943240	Oh, fair he goes again.
8943240	8945240	I know that, look, mama.
8945240	8949240	You won't get an intelligent answer out of him for the next month or so, honestly.
8949240	8951240	I'm very happy for him.
8951240	8954240	I must say that was a very clever dream you had, moment.
8954240	8957240	I'm a better inventor than the mobile.
8957240	8960240	You deserve a triangular energy.
8962240	8966240	So the explosion didn't distress the Snork for long.
8966240	8971240	And he was back in his favorite occupation, planning, but planning what?
8971240	8972240	Round.
8980240	8981240	Round.
8984240	8986240	Round.
8989240	8995240	They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.
8996240	9003240	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
9003240	9007240	They're always happy and goes and played.
9007240	9010240	The movements are having fun day after day.
9010240	9014240	The movements.
9014240	9018240	The movements.
9018240	9023240	The movements.
9026240	9032240	The movements.
9032240	9036240	The movements.
9036240	9038240	The movements.
9038240	9041240	The movements.
9041240	9046240	The movements.
9046240	9049240	The movements.
9049240	9053240	Here they are for one and all.
9053240	9056080	Come on and sit down here with me
9056080	9058600	Therefore you aren't your TV
9058600	9061480	They are the movements
9061480	9064480	They are the movements
9064480	9067680	So come with me, give me your hand
9067680	9070760	I'll take you up to a moment land
9070760	9073520	You can fly just like a bird
9073520	9075960	Sing that song ever
9075960	9078880	There were the movements
9078880	9081800	There were the movements
9081800	9086100	There were the movements
9086100	9093140	There were the movement
9093140	9117140	When the henchmen first told Moomin about the golden fish, Moomin thought to himself that it must look something like this.
9117140	9128140	My grandpa told me that his mother had actually seen it.
9128140	9130140	So you never saw it yourself, Mr. Hamlin?
9130140	9132140	No, I'm a botanist.
9132140	9136140	It comes to the surface only under very special conditions.
9136140	9138140	It's very rarely seen.
9138140	9139140	Conditions?
9139140	9140140	Yes.
9140140	9143140	First of all, it must be right between summer and autumn.
9143140	9145140	But that's now.
9145140	9146140	Yes.
9146140	9149140	It has to be in the afternoon sunshine after heavy rain.
9149140	9151140	Oh, yes, that does narrow it down.
9151140	9153140	And there must be no wind.
9153140	9156140	Grandpa said not even a ripple on the water.
9156140	9157140	Oh, dear.
9157140	9162140	And there are some other conditions that he really didn't know about anyway to see it.
9162140	9166140	You must be extremely lucky.
9166140	9167140	Hmm.
9167140	9169140	Just getting to the lake itself isn't too easy.
9169140	9174140	It's way beyond lonely mountains.
9174140	9178140	Going over lonely mountains and back would take at least two days.
9178140	9181140	Not really, because I know a shortcut, Moomin.
9181140	9183140	I could take you there and back in one day.
9183140	9185140	Oh, could you do that?
9185140	9186140	Yes.
9186140	9188140	Have you already been there, Snuffkin?
9188140	9190140	Just once.
9190140	9192140	Oh, will you show me the way?
9192140	9193140	You really want to go?
9193140	9194140	Yes.
9194140	9198140	I must see that golden fish with my own eyes and maybe capture it.
9198140	9200140	It won't be easy to capture.
9200140	9202140	Why not?
9202140	9206140	From what I've heard, the golden fish is far too clever to get caught.
9206140	9208140	I know, but it would be so much fun.
9208140	9209140	You going alone?
9209140	9212140	Well, Snork Maiden said she wanted to come along.
9212140	9214140	She gets these ideas, you know.
9214140	9215140	Just Snork Maiden?
9215140	9216140	Uh, maybe little Mai.
9216140	9218140	What about Sniff?
9218140	9220140	I think he wants to come along too.
9220140	9222140	What would you?
9222140	9225140	In that case, we'd better go across the mountains.
9225140	9226140	Why is that?
9226140	9228140	Why can't we take the shortcut?
9228140	9231140	The path is rather steep and dangerous, you know, Moomin.
9232140	9234140	Especially in the forest of witches.
9234140	9235140	Hide the witches?
9235140	9236140	Not now, maybe.
9236140	9238140	Oh, so it's safe then.
9238140	9242140	But it's a very deep forest dark and scary even in daytime.
9244140	9247140	That's okay, we'll take the shortcut.
9262140	9266140	Oh, dear.
9286140	9288140	Good morning, Snuffkin.
9292140	9294140	Sorry, Snuffkin.
9294140	9295140	Guess I overslept.
9295140	9298140	Snork Maiden, a little Mai, aren't here yet.
9298140	9300140	You're very early.
9300140	9302140	Hmm, I dreamt I caught the golden fish,
9302140	9304140	and then, of course, I couldn't go back to sleep.
9304140	9305140	Well, let's go.
9305140	9308140	Shouldn't we wait for Snork Maiden and little Mai?
9308140	9311140	Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?
9311140	9313140	And anyway, didn't we decide to go back to sleep?
9313140	9314140	Well, let's go.
9314140	9317140	Shouldn't we wait for Snork Maiden and little Mai?
9317140	9319140	Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?
9319140	9323140	And anyway, didn't we decide that we wouldn't wait for anybody?
9323140	9325140	So it might be better this way.
9325140	9327140	What's better this way, woman?
9327140	9329140	Oh, little Mai.
9330140	9331140	Why don't you stay here?
9331140	9333140	This will be a very tough expedition.
9333140	9335140	I'm tougher than you.
9335140	9337140	Wait for me.
9343140	9345140	Hey, walk any faster, Snuffkin.
9345140	9347140	I'm still so sleepy.
9349140	9351140	Why did we have to leave so early, moving?
9351140	9354140	To get there back in a day, Snork Maiden.
9354140	9356140	But we aren't taking the shortcut, are we?
9356140	9359140	Yes, but it still might get dark before we're back.
9359140	9361140	I won't be able to walk back this fast, you know,
9361140	9364140	because my bucket will be full of water for the golden fish.
9364140	9367140	Well, don't be disappointed if you don't catch it.
9367140	9369140	But that's my whole reason for going.
9369140	9371140	But you heard what the Himmielin said, Snuff?
9371140	9375140	We'll be extremely lucky to even catch sight of the golden fish.
9375140	9378140	I heard him, and now's exactly the right time.
9378140	9380140	Maybe the others made too much noise.
9380140	9382140	We'll just have to wait and see.
9382140	9384140	Don't you worry, I'll catch him all right.
9394140	9398140	Where are they going, sorely in the body?
9401140	9403140	How far is the forest of witches?
9403140	9405140	I'd say about two hours.
9406140	9411140	And can you also tell us how long from one end of the forest to the other, Snuffkin?
9411140	9413140	About the same.
9415140	9418140	Are there really such things as witches?
9418140	9419140	No.
9419140	9421140	Baby, because I'm not a bit scared of them.
9421140	9422140	Aren't you?
9422140	9423140	Not the least little bit.
9423140	9425140	There used to be some, though.
9425140	9426140	Well, of course, Sniff.
9426140	9430140	Why else do you think that they call it the forest of witches, huh?
9430140	9433140	And you're absolutely sure that there are no witches now.
9434140	9436140	I haven't heard of any coming back.
9436140	9437140	Mm-hmm.
9437140	9440140	So you're not absolutely sure that there are no witches.
9448140	9450140	Where's Moominer still in bed?
9450140	9453140	He was off before you woke up, Papa.
9453140	9454140	Mm-hmm.
9454140	9457140	Oh, the golden fish.
9457140	9459140	Good morning, dear.
9459140	9460140	I wanted to go with him.
9460140	9463140	But you're writing your memoirs you're far too busy.
9463140	9464140	Mm-hmm.
9464140	9467140	That's very true with the sort of a fish that no one has seen.
9467140	9470140	That might have been a whole chapter.
9470140	9472140	Do you think they'll catch it?
9472140	9475140	No, my doubt it very much is highly unlikely.
9475140	9477140	In that case, you should have gone with them.
9477140	9478140	Mm-hmm.
9478140	9480140	I do know a thing or two bad fishing.
9480140	9483140	Snuffkin does too, but he's still so young.
9483140	9484140	Oh, don't worry.
9484140	9486140	I'm sure Snuffkin will manage.
9487140	9490140	Oh, this is a spooky forest.
9490140	9492140	Maybe the witch is every time.
9492140	9494140	Stop it, little lion.
9494140	9495140	Listen, everybody.
9495140	9496140	Don't stray away from me.
9496140	9498140	Promise you might get lost.
9517140	9518140	Oh!
9522140	9524140	Oh!
9524140	9526140	Oh!
9526140	9529140	Oh, it's so dark in here.
9529140	9531140	Sure isn't so thick.
9531140	9533140	The sun can't get through.
9535140	9537140	That's because of those clouds.
9540140	9543140	I can hear the wind, but we need calm.
9543140	9546140	Yep, but we also need heavy rain.
9546140	9548140	You're right. That's what the hamulin said.
9548140	9550140	It sure looks like rain.
9550140	9552140	Not only looks like...
9554140	9556140	Oh, it's raining.
9557140	9558140	Yeah.
9572140	9573140	Here.
9573140	9574140	Oh, thank you.
9578140	9581140	My god, I saved this rainstorm with very sudden.
9581140	9583140	Don't worry. It won't last that long.
9583140	9584140	How do you know that?
9584140	9586140	Vagabons do.
9586140	9588140	This rain isn't that heavy.
9588140	9590140	No, it's not bad, but we better hurry.
9590140	9593140	We won't get to the lake till noon, and that'll be too late.
9594140	9597140	I don't think we'll get very wet down here, Moon.
9597140	9599140	So why don't we move on?
9599140	9600140	We're so excited.
9600140	9602140	What should we do Snuffkin?
9603140	9605140	Well, we could move on, couldn't we?
9606140	9607140	Yeah.
9613140	9614140	Yeah!
9623140	9625140	We really aren't getting too wet.
9625140	9628140	We better find some shelter quickly.
9628140	9629140	About where can we shelter?
9629140	9631140	There's nothing in this wood except tree.
9631140	9633140	Under a tree, then, I guess.
9634140	9635140	Yeah!
9636140	9638140	What is it, Snuffkin?
9638140	9640140	There's a house over there.
9646140	9648140	It's falling to rock and ruin.
9648140	9651140	Well, at least it'll keep the rain off.
9664140	9666140	Hello there!
9669140	9671140	Anyone home?
9672140	9674140	There's nobody here.
9684140	9687140	No one's lived here for a long time.
9687140	9691140	I wonder who could have been lived here all along.
9694140	9703140	I know who it was, and so do we all.
9703140	9705140	Surely you don't mean.
9705140	9707140	The Witches, of course.
9710140	9717140	Look around for dried spices, magic herbs, brownie sticks, and a black cat, a niren pot.
9717140	9718140	A pile.
9718140	9719140	But no, bro!
9719140	9721140	No, the Witch rode away on it.
9724140	9725140	No!
9726140	9728140	There's someone here.
9728140	9729140	Who is it?
9736140	9738140	Let's get out of here.
9738140	9740140	It came from over there.
9746140	9748140	No, don't! That's okay, Snuffkin.
9748140	9750140	We gotta get out of this place.
9754140	9755140	Oh!
9760140	9762140	I can't move, Snuffkin.
9762140	9763140	Stinky?
9768140	9769140	Pretty good.
9769140	9771140	I bet you were really scared.
9771140	9773140	I wasn't a bit scared, Stinky.
9773140	9776140	It's very rude of sniff to faint when he hears my voice.
9776140	9778140	Where are you after anyway?
9779140	9783140	Oh, come on, tell me.
9783140	9785140	Can't you even take a joke?
9785140	9787140	Come on, wait for me.
9801140	9802140	That way.
9802140	9803140	Okay.
9805140	9806140	Come on.
9808140	9810140	Come on.
9839140	9840140	This is it, isn't it?
9840140	9841140	Yes it is.
9841140	9842140	Where's the golden fish?
9842140	9843140	I really don't know.
9843140	9845140	I've never seen it either.
9845140	9848140	With rain, sunshine, and calm, I'm sure the fish will come.
9848140	9850140	The golden fish?
9850140	9851140	Help me catch it.
9851140	9853140	I just gotta have that golden fish.
9862140	9863140	No!
9869140	9871140	It's deep down in here somewhere.
9880140	9882140	I can't see any fish anywhere.
9882140	9886140	Maybe it was Hemiellin's idea of a very funny joke.
9886140	9889140	The Hemiellin doesn't joke.
9889140	9891140	Let's sit down and wait.
9891140	9893140	I'm sure the golden fish will appear for us.
9893140	9895140	I don't believe it.
9895140	9899140	I mean to say you came all this way here just to see some stupid old fish.
9899140	9900140	I came to catch it.
9900140	9902140	Well, that's even more stupid.
9902140	9904140	Hey, stop making those ripples.
9908140	9912140	So they really got excited and walked all the way, you say?
9912140	9914140	Oh, to be young again.
9914140	9917140	Well, I would have gone with them if I hadn't over slept.
9917140	9921140	I didn't know that you were that young woman, Papa.
9921140	9923140	I'm not exactly old, you know.
9923140	9927140	Pretty interesting to see a fish that hardly anyone's ever seen.
9927140	9932140	Sniff said that he would catch this golden fish if it's the last thing he did.
9932140	9933140	Oh, how?
9933140	9938140	Well, he had a net and a very large bucket to carry at home, then.
9938140	9941140	That's a good one.
9941140	9943140	What do you mean?
9943140	9946140	I guess I must have forgotten to tell you all the details.
9946140	9949140	There's so much you don't know about this fish.
9954140	9956140	Hmm.
9956140	9958140	Can't see it from up here.
9958140	9959140	Hmm.
9959140	9962140	Oh, the hamulan was certainly right.
9962140	9966140	Hardly anyone has seen this golden fish and we're not going to see it either.
9966140	9968140	Maybe somebody ate him years ago.
9968140	9971140	Stinky, be quiet, please.
9973140	9974140	Did you see it?
9974140	9976140	Where did you see it?
9978140	9982140	I saw a fish jump, but I couldn't tell if it was golden.
9982140	9984140	It was much too far away.
9984140	9987140	With the sun over there, we just see the outlines, Nork Maiden.
9987140	9989140	Yes, we couldn't really see the color.
9989140	9991140	Look, everybody, look.
9991140	9994140	I can see a raft over there.
9994140	9997140	Hey, let's take it and go out to the middle of the lake.
9997140	10000140	But it's much too small for all of us.
10000140	10003140	Don't worry, Sniff, this won't sink.
10006140	10007140	I'm staying.
10007140	10011140	You do what you like, but you'll never catch any fish if you're afraid of water.
10012140	10014140	Hmm.
10014140	10016140	Stinky, you can help me.
10016140	10017140	It's gold, you know.
10017140	10021140	We can sell it for a lot of money and then we'll both be very wealthy.
10032140	10035140	I think it was somewhere around here, wasn't it?
10035140	10038140	Or, unless I suppose, hard to say.
10038140	10040140	Well, I can't see anything.
10041140	10042140	I can't see.
10042140	10045140	There's certainly no sign of it now.
10045140	10049140	Well, we'll just have to sit and wait here.
10049140	10051140	We have no choice.
10051140	10053140	And I'm not going home until I've seen it.
10053140	10055140	I'm happy to wait all day.
10055140	10058140	You won't find it by looking up at the sky.
10058140	10059140	You know what?
10059140	10063140	Fish like it in places where there are lots of weeds.
10063140	10065140	Oh, the raft's in the middle of the lake.
10065140	10068140	And they just want to see the fish, but you wait.
10068140	10070140	I'm going to catch it.
10070140	10074140	Maybe somebody's already caught it and you can get it in the tin.
10079140	10080140	What did you see?
10080140	10083140	Over there, something shiny jumping.
10083140	10084140	What did you see?
10084140	10085140	That's all you.
10085140	10086140	Now keep quiet.
10099140	10101140	I hate fishing.
10101140	10107140	Guess we better think about getting back otherwise we'll never get home before nightfall.
10107140	10111140	I don't want to get lost on a raft in the dark on this lonely lake.
10111140	10114140	Perhaps we were expecting too much.
10114140	10118140	Maybe your right's not made in, but I really thought we'd see it.
10118140	10121140	This is the most disappointing day of my life.
10121140	10123140	We can come back.
10123140	10124140	Yes.
10129140	10131140	It's not going to stop.
10143140	10144140	Hang on.
10144140	10146140	Did you see a moment?
10146140	10147140	Shh.
10159140	10160140	Oh.
10167140	10169140	It's gigantic.
10189140	10190140	Oh.
10190140	10191140	Oh.
10191140	10192140	Oh.
10192140	10193140	Oh.
10193140	10194140	Oh.
10194140	10195140	Oh.
10197140	10198140	Oh.
10198140	10199140	Oh.
10199140	10200140	Oh.
10200140	10201140	Oh.
10201140	10202140	Oh.
10202140	10203140	Oh.
10203140	10204140	Oh.
10204140	10205140	Oh.
10205140	10206140	Oh.
10206140	10207140	Oh.
10207140	10208140	Oh.
10208140	10209140	Oh.
10209140	10210140	Oh.
10210140	10211140	Oh.
10211140	10212140	Oh.
10212140	10213140	Oh.
10213140	10214140	Oh.
10214140	10215140	Oh.
10215140	10216140	Oh.
10216140	10217140	Oh.
10218140	10219140	We've seen.
10219140	10220140	We have.
10220140	10221140	Oh.
10221140	10222140	That was right.
10222140	10223140	I really saw it.
10223140	10224140	I saw it.
10224140	10226140	First it was I believe about it.
10226140	10227140	Oh.
10227140	10228140	Oh.
10228140	10229140	Oh.
10231140	10234140	Oh.

10289140	10290140	I love it.
10290140	10291140	I love it.
10291140	10292140	I love it.
10292140	10293140	I love it.
10293140	10294140	I think it was cool.
10294140	10295140	I love it.
10295140	10296140	I think it was cool.
10296140	10297140	I love it.
10297140	10298140	I love it.
10298140	10299140	Well, I envy it.
10299140	10300140	It's cool.
10300140	10301140	I envy it.
10301140	10302140	Well, I envy it.
10302140	10316500	Steth and Stinky never really got over their belief that it was actually the golden fish
10316500	10318000	they had caught.
10318000	10323420	But moving in the others were in no doubt about what they had seen, the aim of the emilence
10323420	10330420	they were in no doubt about what they had seen, the aim of the emilence, they were in no
10330420	10338420	doubt about what they had seen, the aim of the emilence, they were in no doubt about
10338420	10345420	what they had seen, the aim of the emilence, they were in no doubt about what they had seen,
10345420	10352420	the aim of the emilence, they were in no doubt about what they had seen, the aim of the
10352420	10359420	emilence, the movements, the movements.
10382420	10393420	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here
10393420	10402420	with me, they here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.
10402420	10410420	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land, you can fly
10410420	10417420	just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,
10417420	10428420	there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,
10428420	10440420	there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,
10440420	10445420	Snoke made him was in a very good mood because that day she was off to collect shells
10445420	10455420	of the sea shore with me, movement.
10455420	10460420	Hey, look, the sun's up, and there's Gracie.
10465420	10467420	Oh, rat.
10467420	10469420	What's the matter, Papa?
10469420	10471420	Oh, it's your moment.
10471420	10473420	What are you doing?
10473420	10475420	I heard you talking to yourself just now.
10475420	10477420	Huh? Oh.
10479420	10482420	You see this? I'm writing a play.
10482420	10483420	Writing a play?
10483420	10485420	You remember the last children?
10485420	10489420	That was a very successful play, and just now I was repeating a line.
10489420	10493420	Hey, look, another beautiful day, and there goes Gracie.
10493420	10495420	It's a wonderful line, of course.
10495420	10497420	Don't you agree?
10497420	10499420	It could be improved.
10499420	10501420	I think about it.
10514420	10516420	Moment, moment, look at this.
10516420	10518420	Beautiful.
10521420	10522420	You find anything?
10522420	10524420	No, just usual old stuff.
10531420	10533420	Oh, there's another big one.
10533420	10535420	Can't you really find anything, moment?
10538420	10540420	I'll look somewhere else.
10540420	10542420	I still think this is the best place.
10542420	10544420	Well, I'm going off of there.
10546420	10548420	You're so beautiful.
10550420	10552420	Oh.
10554420	10556420	What are you doing, moment?
10556420	10558420	No, that's no shell surely.
10558420	10559420	No.
10559420	10561420	So why did you dig it out?
10561420	10564420	Well, once you see it, you want to find out what it is.
10566420	10568420	A very odd thing, isn't it?
10568420	10570420	Not very interesting.
10573420	10576420	Oh, no, I can see what it is.
10576420	10578420	I gave it a good wash.
10578420	10580420	I've seen one just like it in the fairy tales.
10580420	10582420	It's an old lamb.
10582420	10584420	Yes, you remember the story called him added?
10584420	10586420	He rubbed the lamb and the genie appeared.
10586420	10590420	The genie might appear for us if we do what Aladdin did.
10590420	10593420	Don't be silly, Snork Maiden.
10596420	10600420	But Snork Maiden, that was a fairy tale.
10600420	10603420	Don't laugh. I just want to make absolutely sure.
10603420	10606420	To tell you the truth, I've already tried it.
10606420	10609420	My hands turned green. That's all that happened to me.
10609420	10611420	Maybe you didn't do it the right way.
10611420	10613420	You can't even whip cream properly.
10614420	10617420	And I'm sure you have to say some magic words such as
10617420	10620420	apricot dapura, spirit, come forth.
10620420	10623420	Apricot dapura, try for all your words.
10623420	10625420	You've chosen the wrong words.
10625420	10628420	You should say, come out, say something or something.
10629420	10632420	Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.
10632420	10634420	Keep going, Snork Maiden.
10646420	10648420	I am the spirit of the land.
10648420	10650420	What is your command?
10653420	10656420	Goodness, did you come out of this lamp?
10656420	10657420	You got it.
10657420	10660420	So you really are the spirit of this lamp?
10660420	10661420	Always have been.
10661420	10664420	But I have the book and you're not him.
10664420	10668420	I can prove it if you're quite sure you want me to.
10668420	10671420	By all means, it probably wasn't a good picture.
10671420	10674420	I'm the one and only spirit of the lamp.
10674420	10679420	Then you must have the power to make any wish come true, is that so?
10679420	10681420	Are we certainly but not yours?
10681420	10683420	But I'm the one who dug you out.
10683420	10685420	That's not so important, kid.
10685420	10688420	She's the one who summoned me forth from the lamp.
10688420	10690420	What are we going to do about this spirit?
10690420	10692420	Why, ask for something.
10692420	10694420	Ask for something you've always wanted.
10694420	10696420	Uh, let's see.
10696420	10697420	A pearl necklace.
10697420	10700420	So it may your wishes, my command.
10701420	10703420	Hey, wait a minute.
10703420	10707420	Oh, a pearl necklace is only one of the things I wanted.
10707420	10708420	I hadn't decided yet.
10708420	10710420	Don't worry, Snork Maiden.
10710420	10712420	I guess you can always send it back.
10712420	10715420	If I like the necklace, then it's your turn to rub the lamp.
10715420	10718420	Then you can wish for whatever you've always wanted.
10718420	10719420	Yes.
10719420	10722420	But where exactly did you rub the lamp?
10722420	10724420	Right here, and very, very slowly.
10724420	10725420	All right.
10725420	10727420	I'll say spirit come forth.
10727420	10730420	It sounds a little better than come out, spirit.
10730420	10739420	Oh, that was loud.
10739420	10745420	Oh, he's back.
10745420	10747420	One oil necklace, Miss.
10747420	10748420	Thanks.
10748420	10750420	This is incredible.
10750420	10751420	Right.
10751420	10754420	I do think this is exactly what I wanted.
10754420	10756420	Oh, thank you ever so much.
10756420	10758420	All in a day's wake.
10758420	10762420	So pleased to oblige, Miss.
10762420	10764420	Are you going back into the lamp?
10764420	10765420	Yes, I am.
10765420	10766420	I'm so happy.
10766420	10769420	Now, it's my turn to let you out of here.
10769420	10772420	I'd like to have a wish granted, too, please.
10772420	10773420	Now, wait a minute.
10773420	10778420	If getting in and out is a bother, why don't you let me give you my wish right now?
10778420	10780420	Can't do it, young man.
10780420	10782420	One at a time in the face to call.
10782420	10784420	Just wanted to save time.
10784420	10785420	Impossible, young say.
10785420	10786420	But why?
10786420	10790420	Because I am only able to fulfill one wish a week.
10790420	10791420	I need my rest.
10791420	10793420	It's hard working, though.
10793420	10795420	Oh, well, of course it's tiring.
10795420	10797420	Perhaps I expected too much from you.
10797420	10798420	Hold on.
10798420	10801420	I wouldn't like you to think that I haven't got the power.
10801420	10803420	I can do many extraordinary things.
10803420	10804420	What kind of things?
10804420	10805420	Not telling you.
10812420	10813420	Listen, moment.
10813420	10815420	We won't tell a soul about this lamp, all right?
10815420	10816420	Of course not.
10824420	10825420	No.
10838420	10840420	No, names don't really matter.
10840420	10844420	Tulip, hydranger, who cares?
10844420	10846420	No, that's not right somehow.
10846420	10848420	I'm a geranium of ox glove.
10848420	10850420	Oh, I'm so tired.
10853420	10856040	H.L.D View
10876560	10877800	Hmm.
10879300	10882280	Praise the lad and I didn't tell them I can get out at night.
10882280	10886520	I'd have no peace at all. My leisure time would be totally ruined by these two
10887400	10893260	Good thing also I can read their minds, so I know what I'm up against. They're up to something I know they are
10904780	10909760	Oh, yes, dear me dear me no one did the young man is worried to death
10910760	10913440	She wish I better rewrite this. Oh
10914760	10917920	Edgur Edgur, I do wish you was somebody else
10918600	10922840	This will certainly have to be changed the whole page really
10922840	10945520	What's going on here? Who did this? Mom, not you surely what some
10945520	10952000	Rascals been rewriting my play. Who could that possibly be who indeed in the middle of the night while I was asleep
10952000	10961080	It's very strange, isn't it Papa? It can't be you moment, can't it? Of course not Papa. I am upset. Who can it be?
10961840	10966280	Imagine going into your study while you were fast asleep. It's very rude, isn't it?
10966280	10969360	I find it incredible that anyone could do such a thing
10969880	10974040	And all the rewriting was done on those bits that I knew weren't perfectly polished
10974600	10977880	Listen dear. I'm sure they were far too good for him to improve on
10978600	10984040	No, no, you're wrong. That's the worst thing. I must admit he did improve them
10984240	10986560	Then I think you should feel pleased dear
10987080	10992120	Yeah, no, I'm not a bit pleased and parameter should write his own plays
10992800	10996680	Looks great snorkemaiden that is if you like necklaces
10996920	10999560	Thank you little my it was given to me as a present
11000320	11005440	Rather nice would you mind if I tried it on for a minute? Of course not. I'm sure you'll look gorgeous
11006440	11012320	I suppose in time one could get to like necklaces. I could ask for similar one for you
11013720	11015720	Deepers who's your rich friend
11016440	11020840	Yes, I search the whole house, but I can't find it anywhere
11021320	11027480	Someone must have stolen it. Don't worry Mrs. Philly-Johnk. I fully expect to arrest the thief any minute now
11027680	11035320	Good afternoon inspector. Hello, snorkemaiden. Please hurry inspector. The thief is almost certainly let movement valley already
11035440	11041000	Oh dear. Oh dear. Nothing is safe in this valley anymore. Now calm down Mrs. Philly-Johnk
11041000	11045600	Did you just say you've had something stolen Mrs. Philly-Johnk my pearl necklace?
11046080	11051440	Extraordinarily beautiful pearls eighty-seven of them looks just like the one you're wearing little my
11052200	11054200	You stole it
11055640	11057640	Did you
11057640	11059640	Oh
11059640	11061640	What are you doing?
11064640	11066640	She's innocent
11072640	11074640	Snorkemaiden's necklace
11077640	11082480	The best explanation you can think of no one calls little my a thief and gets away with it
11082840	11090360	Is it really true that this is your necklace snorkemaiden? Of course inspector. It was a present. I swear it who gave it to you
11090360	11093760	That's a secret between me and movement a secret
11094200	11099720	That's a lie. They stole it inspector. I've never known them to lie before Mrs. Philly-Johnk
11099720	11102360	From a very bad background you should see their home
11102360	11104360	So
11109960	11111960	Something I want to ask you
11132480	11134480	I love to know
11138480	11140480	Listen to this. This is a good example
11141120	11144600	Hey look at the sky the sun's up and there's Gracie
11145320	11147320	That's not great sounds very ordinary
11148320	11151480	That's what I wrote snuffkin. Oh, I'm so sorry
11152160	11155200	That's all right now listen to how he rewrote it
11155720	11162720	But soft what light through yonder window breaks it is the east and juliet is the sun a rise
11163000	11168120	Verson and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief
11169120	11174840	What a sunrise and not how clever this writer is to change a name from Gracie to juliet
11176200	11179440	Gracie's worried because appearance don't approve of her love Edgar
11179440	11185080	I had his names don't matter tulip. I'd rangers who cares but listen to this
11185560	11192840	What's in a name that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet much more romantic
11195400	11200440	Not a Romeo called oh, it's simply great except maybe I wouldn't have mentioned his smell
11200880	11203160	Don't you agree is an excellent playwright?
11204640	11211640	Yes, I agree he sounds like a very promising playwright and then wordy perhaps but really good very good indeed
11212440	11216800	Write him a note asking him to carry on and there might not be necessary
11216800	11224840	You know all the changes were made in the middle of the night while I was fast asleep and usually writers are in their beds none of their desks when they're asleep
11226600	11231440	Well, yes, that's the only time you're not at your desk isn't it but there are people
11231440	11236720	You know who walk about at night without remembering about it the next morning sleepwalkers
11236720	11241480	You mean now I come to think of it you were rather sleepy when you woke up this morning
11241640	11250760	You're right mum and mama even sleepier than usual just so you mean you yourself got up at night and then went and rewrote the play and you're sleep
11251360	11256160	Well, yes, I have been worried about some minor things in my play
11256720	11261480	So my subconsciousness fairly rich in literary talent as we all know
11261720	11267000	Comes to the rescue a moment papa and in my sleep my imagination runs riot
11267000	11274840	I have all sorts of good ideas that make me grab a pen in the middle of the night and rush to my room to let the real skill through
11277360	11279360	Got it
11279360	11283800	I got it with this I can have anything I can do anything
11297000	11312360	I know why you're running you stole that thing in you I know it's true
11316200	11318200	But it must be somebody so
11327000	11329000	Like
11340840	11342840	Like
11342840	11344840	Did you hear that enough here?
11345160	11347160	You said magic lamp or something
11357000	11386280	You're the spirit of the lamp aren't you? Yes, my master. What is your wish? You his master? Yes, me
11387000	11393880	I'm the master I let him out so he'll do what I say I don't believe a word of this fairy tales on true
11394520	11401000	Maybe it isn't true, but it works. I saw snork maiden wishing for a pearl necklace and her wish was granted
11401640	11406200	Uh-huh, so you're responsible. Yeah, and I brought it right away
11406840	11408840	God now let me see
11409080	11411320	What do I want more than anything in the world?
11411640	11416040	Stinky he can only make one wish a week come true. You'll have to wait your turn
11416520	11418520	No, that's very unfair
11419480	11425560	Let's get back to the necklace where did you steal it from mr. I don't steal well then tell me where you found it
11426600	11435560	Around here somewhere. Mrs. Philly Johns house, maybe I don't know who lives there. Oh, then you did steal the necklace. Well, that's a lot easier, you know
11437000	11440600	How about a magic key that can open anything bolts and safes and stuff huh?
11441320	11447560	Listen, there's something I'd like to ask you a sack of gold wouldn't be half as much fun as a key that opens anything
11447960	11454920	Tell me is it possible that you rewrote woman poppers play? Yes, I did. It was really awful. Oh come on
11455320	11462360	I just needed some polishing and what's more? See this young man standing here? Well, he was really worried about your play
11462360	11464360	You know, I was just trying to help
11464760	11466760	Is this true
11466840	11473560	Saver the mercury of course, but then there's professional pride to think of I can explain papa
11473560	11477400	I saw you weren't happy about your play and I wanted it to be a big success
11479000	11482920	Of course, I didn't want the spirit to write it himself. I'm gonna take the key
11483080	11487160	Yeah, I've just realized everybody the spirit didn't write all that himself
11487720	11490520	I've heard it before I thought it sounded familiar
11490760	11492760	There's that soul
11492760	11497800	Yes, he stole it from a play by somebody else this spirit is a cheat and a liar
11498840	11500840	Oh, dear me
11501080	11504280	Well, I can't help being so well read can I go back in the lamp now?
11508520	11512440	Sorry, master can't oblige have been put into an impossible situation
11512840	11514840	See you next week
11518040	11522840	But that's ridiculous not next week nor next month or even next year
11523320	11530040	Stinky this lamp is not yours besides I know exactly the sort of thing you'd ask for a master key or something
11531400	11537160	Ha, you think you can hide that magic lamp from me, do you? Well, there's no hiding place good enough for that
11537880	11539880	Hmm
11539880	11543880	Well, then I really do think that lamp is a bit too dangerous to have a rod
11544440	11546440	Hmm, I think you're right
11546840	11549400	Snuffkin, do you have any good ideas for us?
11549400	11551400	I
11563000	11565400	Week is passed so we can summon the spirit again
11575320	11577320	There's the inspector
11580120	11584600	You do it snuffkin cold the spirit
11593640	11596200	Oh, no, not again. What do you want this time?
11596920	11601880	Can you bring the hobgoblin here? I suppose so I'll be back as soon as I can
11609800	11611800	But why an earth do you want the hobgoblin?
11613560	11617880	As far as I can see there's only one safe place for the lamp where no one can find it
11618680	11622440	And that's on another planet and the only one who can put it there is the hobgoblin
11623480	11628120	He's coming any minute. Geez that guy ever hard to find thank you
11628520	11631720	I've done my wake for this week. See you next week goodbye
11639960	11641960	Oh
11651240	11658360	And some of the hobgoblin took the magic ramp away and headed on some unknown planet and a good thing too
11659000	11663240	It would really be very boring if all your wishes were granted wouldn't it
11664200	11666200	You
11666600	11671560	They love the laughter and they love the living the movements
11673640	11678920	We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements
11681240	11688520	They're always happy and goes at play the moments are having fun day after day the
11688520	11690520	movements
11692040	11694040	The
11701560	11703560	No
11718520	11732000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here
11732000	11742240	with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements, so come
11742240	11749440	with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like
11749440	11758960	a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements, there
11758960	11768840	were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,
11769480	11775880	The movements and movements were about to come.
11775880	11799880	Winter was just around the corner, and that was the time of year for movement to get
11799880	11814040	restless. Because this was the time of year for snuffkin to leave
11814040	11832040	movement valley on his yearly trek south.
11832040	11835040	Good morning, Papa. That bonfire looks inviting.
11835040	11838040	No, you're up already.
11838040	11842040	I'm scared and leaves this morning after that wind last night.
11842040	11847040	Yes, winders on the way. Oh, this is a lovely bonfire.
11847040	11850040	Yes, isn't it?
11850040	11854040	I guess we're hibernating again this winter. Are we moving, Papa?
11854040	11858040	Well, of course. We always hibernate in the winter.
11858040	11864040	If snuffkin says I could go with him, couldn't I give this winter a miss and hibernate longer next year?
11865040	11867040	Oh, please, movement, Papa.
11867040	11870040	Snuffkin would rather go alone, I think, movement.
11870040	11873040	Would I might get him to train his mind?
11873040	11877040	That snuffkin's not really a person who likes to be pressed.
11877040	11878040	Why not?
11878040	11885040	Well, he's a very solitary person. His winter trip is the only time he can really be alone for a while.
11885040	11888040	I know, but I was just hoping.
11888040	11891040	Snuffkin likes you very much. I know that.
11892040	11896040	And I think that's why he stays in movement valley for the rest of the year.
11896040	11901040	But at heart, he's a vagabond and he needs time away from us.
11901040	11904040	He's not a family man, so he's free to do as he wants.
11904040	11907040	And as his friend, you should try to understand.
11907040	11911040	I know you'd like to go with him, but I don't think he's such a good idea.
11911040	11914040	He'd really hate to turn you down, I know.
11914040	11915040	I guess.
11915040	11917040	But he'd have to.
11921040	11923040	Oh.
11933040	11936040	Why aren't they biting?
11936040	11939040	I haven't had a proper catch for days.
11939040	11941040	Getting too cold, is that?
11944040	11946040	When are you leaving?
11946040	11948040	You're about to leave, aren't you?
11948040	11950040	Yes.
11952040	11956040	Could I ask you something?
11956040	11958040	What?
11958040	11960040	Don't go without telling me.
11960040	11961040	But why?
11961040	11966040	I'm always sad when you leave, even though I know you'll return in the spring.
11966040	11969040	Yeah. Me too, sort of.
11969040	11972040	That's why this year I'd plan to leave without saying anything.
11972040	11976040	But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly.
11976040	11978040	I'd like to wish you good luck and all that.
11978040	11980040	I miss you so much when you're away.
11980040	11983040	Please, Nuffkin.
11983040	11985040	Moomin, I have a better idea.
11985040	11987040	I won't leave until after you've started hibernating.
11987040	11989040	Then you won't miss me, will you?
11989040	11990040	You're right.
11990040	11992040	I'll take my right idea, Snuffkin.
11992040	11994040	Then we won't really part at all, won't we?
11994040	11995040	Nope.
11995040	11999040	Because I promise to be back here in Moomin Valley before you've even woken up.
11999040	12004040	Wonderful. What a super idea.
12004040	12007040	Hey, Moomin!
12007040	12009040	Oh, Snuff.
12009040	12011040	Moomin, come here a minute.
12011040	12013040	There's something funny caught up in a tree.
12013040	12015040	What do you mean, funny?
12015040	12016040	I don't know exactly.
12016040	12018040	Never saw anything like it before.
12018040	12020040	Snork made a little my-founded first,
12020040	12022040	but it's too high to get it down.
12022040	12024040	Okay, I'll come have a look.
12029040	12031040	Be careful.
12033040	12036040	Be careful. What is it, Moomin?
12036040	12041040	I know what it is. It's a kite.
12041040	12044040	Oh, what?
12044040	12046040	A kite is something you find in the sky.
12046040	12048040	But it has no wings.
12048040	12051040	No, you send it up against the wind on a string.
12058040	12061040	Just a little bit more.
12067040	12069040	Wait a second.
12081040	12083040	Wait a second.
12085040	12087040	I'll throw it down.
12087040	12090040	That's all right.
12091040	12094040	Hey!
12098040	12101040	Oh, song. This is what a kite looks like.
12101040	12103040	Looks broken to me.
12103040	12106040	I'm sure we can fix it and make it fly.
12106040	12107040	Let's see.
12107040	12109040	Oh, no. The string must have broken
12109040	12110040	when someone was flying it
12110040	12112040	and the wind blew it down into the tree.
12112040	12114040	Well, why don't we repair it?
12114040	12115040	Yes, let's.
12115040	12117040	Looks pretty badly broken to me.
12118040	12121040	Well, I don't know. We'll have to see.
12124040	12126040	It is a kite, isn't it?
12126040	12127040	Can we mend it?
12127040	12129040	Maybe.
12132040	12134040	A very odd kite?
12134040	12137040	It must have come from far away.
12137040	12139040	You think it can be repaired?
12139040	12140040	Of course.
12140040	12141040	Well, come on, then.
12141040	12143040	Snork will help you repair it.
12143040	12145040	I can repair it without your help
12145040	12148040	as long as you can find us some really long string,
12148040	12151040	strong but not too thick of possible.
12151040	12154040	I think I have what you need, some string.
12154040	12158040	Good. Excellent. I'll start immediately.
12176040	12177040	Good.
12177040	12178040	Good.
12178040	12179040	Good.
12179040	12180040	Good.
12180040	12181040	Good.
12181040	12182040	Good.
12182040	12183040	Good.
12183040	12184040	Good.
12184040	12185040	Good.
12185040	12186040	Good.
12186040	12187040	Good.
12187040	12188040	Good.
12188040	12189040	Good.
12189040	12190040	Good.
12190040	12191040	Good.
12191040	12192040	Good.
12192040	12193040	Good.
12193040	12194040	Good.
12194040	12195040	Good.
12195040	12196040	Good.
12196040	12197040	Good.
12197040	12198040	Good.
12198040	12199040	Good.
12199040	12200040	Good.
12200040	12201040	Good.
12201040	12202040	Good.
12202040	12203040	Good.
12203040	12204040	Good.
12204040	12205040	Good.
12205040	12206040	Good.
12206040	12207040	Good.
12207040	12208040	Good.
12208040	12209040	Good.
12209040	12210040	Good.
12210040	12211040	Good.
12211040	12212040	Good.
12212040	12213040	Good.
12213040	12214040	Good.
12214040	12215040	Good.
12215040	12216040	Good.
12216040	12217040	Good.
12217040	12218040	Good.
12218040	12219040	Good.
12219040	12224040	This is a really exciting project I haven't flown a kite for years.
12224040	12227040	I do hope that string is long enough.
12227040	12229040	Snork, is this okay?
12229040	12230040	Fine.
12230040	12231040	Who's going to fly it?
12231040	12232040	I'll do it.
12232040	12234040	Okay, sniff.
12234040	12235040	Moving.
12235040	12236040	Hold the kite up high.
12236040	12237040	Like this.
12237040	12238040	Hmm.
12238040	12239040	All right, sniff.
12239040	12240040	Are you ready?
12240040	12241040	Yeah.
12241040	12242040	I'm ready.
12242040	12243040	Don't let go.
12243040	12244040	Do I say win?
12244040	12245040	Hmm.
12245040	12246040	Win, moment.
12246040	12247040	Oh.
12247040	12248040	Oh.
12248040	12249040	Oh.
12249040	12250040	It's falling.
12250040	12251040	Oh.
12251040	12252040	Oh.
12252040	12253040	Oh.
12253040	12254040	Oh.
12254040	12255040	Oh.
12255040	12256040	It's falling.
12256040	12257040	Oh.
12257040	12258040	Oh.
12258040	12259040	It's falling.
12259040	12260040	Try again.
12260040	12263040	And this time, start running them when the wind catches the kite.
12263040	12265040	You start paying out the light.
12265040	12266040	All right.
12266040	12267040	Fine.
12267040	12268040	Hold it up again, moment.
12268040	12269040	Right.
12269040	12270040	Ready?
12270040	12271040	Yeah.
12271040	12272040	I'm ready.
12272040	12274040	Let go of it.
12274040	12276040	Easy going up yet.
12276040	12280040	No, it isn't.
12280040	12282040	Stop, sniff.
12282040	12284040	You're breaking the kite.
12284040	12285040	Hmm.
12285040	12288040	I don't think this kite's any good for anybody.
12288040	12290040	The kite's fine.
12290040	12292040	It's just that the wind is too weak.
12292040	12293040	All right.
12293040	12295040	We'll have to wait for it to get stronger.
12295040	12298040	Pretty though, we certainly had a good strong wind yesterday.
12298040	12300040	Is it okay?
12300040	12301040	Hmm.
12301040	12304040	I think the wind is getting stronger, moment.
12316040	12317040	Oh.
12321040	12322040	There it goes.
12329040	12331040	Let me hold the string, moment.
12334040	12336040	Boy, this wind is really strong.
12336040	12338040	Can I let out the string now?
12338040	12339040	Do it slowly, mind.
12339040	12340040	All right.
12341040	12343040	Let me do it.
12343040	12344040	Snip, come on.
12344040	12345040	It's my turn.
12345040	12346040	Let me break your kiln, little lion.
12346040	12347040	Why not?
12347040	12349040	Because you don't weigh enough to hold it.
12349040	12350040	I'm very strong.
12350040	12351040	The wind is quite dry.
12351040	12352040	You go up with it.
12364040	12365040	You have more sniff.
12365040	12366040	Yes, Papa?
12366040	12368040	It is better to hold it for a while.
12369040	12371040	Well, yes, you'd like it.
12371040	12373040	Hold it really tight, then.
12378040	12379040	All right.
12379040	12381040	I could do this long before it was born.
12382040	12383040	Oops.
12386040	12387040	What's happening?
12389040	12391040	Papa, why did you drop quickly?
12391040	12394040	And I'm winding, I'm winding.
12395040	12397040	Faster, oh, wind it faster.
12408040	12410040	That was definitely not my fault.
12410040	12412040	Of course it wasn't.
12412040	12414040	With such a strong wind up there,
12414040	12417040	I think we have to lower the centre of gravity a bit.
12420040	12422040	The kite's all right, Papa.
12423040	12425040	Hmm, maybe it would take me with it.
12440040	12441040	That's it.
12441040	12444040	I suppose that's to stop it from spinning around.
12444040	12445040	Is it snorke?
12445040	12446040	Yes, that's right.
12453040	12455040	What is it?
12457040	12459040	Listen, I'm going to ride that kite.
12459040	12461040	What did you say?
12461040	12464040	I think it's going to be okay now.
12464040	12466040	If I hold on really tight,
12466040	12469040	I think I could have a wonderful ride on that kite.
12469040	12471040	Yes, maybe it'd be wonderful while you're up in the sky,
12471040	12474040	but you've seen how fast it can come down again.
12474040	12477040	But the snorke just said it won't fall down again.
12477040	12478040	Even so.
12478040	12480040	I'm going to do it.
12480040	12481040	But no one must see me,
12481040	12484040	or they might try to stop me if they guess what I'm up to.
12484040	12486040	Oh, please don't do it.
12486040	12488040	What are you doing?
12488040	12489040	Listen carefully.
12489040	12490040	Yes.
12491040	12494040	When we fly the kite next time.
12494040	12495040	Huh?
12495040	12498040	What are you two whispering about?
12498040	12499040	We weren't snorke-made,
12499040	12503040	and I was just saying to sniff that the kite wouldn't fall down again.
12503040	12505040	It won't, snorke is fixed it.
12505040	12507040	But you can't be absolutely sure.
12507040	12509040	And you'll be holding the kite won't you sniff?
12509040	12512040	Now then, do you want to do it, moving?
12512040	12513040	Yes.
12513040	12515040	And this time I'll let out all the line.
12515040	12518040	And sniff, you could hold it up, okay?
12518040	12520040	Yes, that's fine.
12520040	12521040	No.
12521040	12523040	I'm counting on you, sniff.
12523040	12525040	And so am I, sniff?
12525040	12526040	Hmm.
12535040	12537040	Are you sure you'll be all right?
12537040	12538040	Of course I will, silly.
12538040	12540040	Well, I'm not so sure.
12540040	12542040	Why don't you keep your eyes closed then?
12542040	12543040	Good idea.
12545040	12546040	Okay, sniff.
12546040	12548040	Let go of it when I say ready.
12548040	12549040	Hi.
12554040	12555040	Ready.
12568040	12570040	Hi.
12570040	12572040	Hi.
12572040	12574040	Hi.
12574040	12576040	Hi.
12576040	12578040	Hi.
12578040	12580040	Hi.
12586040	12588040	Hi.
12588040	12590040	Hi.
12590040	12592040	Hi.
12592040	12594040	Hi.
12594040	12595040	That's it.
12595040	12596040	That's all of the line.
12596040	12598040	It's very high.
12598040	12600040	Must be some wind up there.
12600040	12602040	It's flying really well, isn't it?
12602040	12604040	Certainly is.
12604040	12606040	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
12606040	12608040	This is getting bumpy.
12608040	12610040	Oh!
12610040	12614040	What's that?
12614040	12617040	Let's see if there's something very strange happening on that kite.
12617040	12619040	What is it?
12619040	12621040	I can't see properly from here.
12621040	12623040	I saw something.
12623040	12625040	Could it be a bird, maybe?
12625040	12627040	The kite is turned again.
12627040	12629040	But it wasn't a bird.
12629040	12631040	Or a twig or something, then.
12631040	12633040	I doubt it.
12633040	12635040	Don't you see the back of the kite from where you are, sniff?
12635040	12637040	No, Mom and Mama, because my eyes are closed.
12637040	12639040	Oh.
12639040	12641040	I think I know who it is.
12641040	12643040	Little Mai.
12643040	12645040	What?
12645040	12649040	No, I haven't seen one of my four.
12649040	12651040	She seems to have disappeared.
12651040	12653040	Don't ask me anything.
12653040	12655040	Sniff, what do you mean?
12655040	12657040	No, she was dead set on riding the kite.
12657040	12659040	I couldn't stop her.
12659040	12661040	What?
12661040	12663040	Moment, bring it down very slowly.
12663040	12665040	Huh?
12673040	12675040	Take it easy, Moment. That wind is strong.
12675040	12677040	It could break the line.
12679040	12681040	But that was what it planned last best stream.
12681040	12683040	It's the knot I wore in the board knot.
12683040	12689040	The one between our line and the bit that was still hanging from the kite when we found it.
12689040	12693040	The line is fine, if the knot is another one.
12699040	12701040	Oh my God.
12701040	12703040	Oh my God.
12703040	12705040	Oh my God.
12705040	12707040	Oh my God.
12707040	12709040	Oh my God.
12709040	12711040	Oh my God.
12717040	12719040	Hang on tight, little Mai.
12719040	12721040	That wind is getting stronger.
12723040	12727040	Oh, this is more scarier than I thought.
12729040	12733040	I'll just have to hang on as best as I can.
12733040	12735040	Don't move around so much.
12735040	12737040	I can't help it.
12737040	12739040	It's almost down.
12739040	12741040	What?
12741040	12743040	Oh.
12743040	12745040	Oh.
12745040	12747040	Oh.
12747040	12749040	Oh.
12749040	12751040	Oh my God.
12751040	12753040	It opened.
12753040	12755040	Come on.
12755040	12757040	Sniff, get up.
12757040	12759040	All right.
12759040	12761040	Sniff, pull yourself together.
12761040	12763040	Yes, all right.
12763040	12765040	She's being blown away towards lonely mountains.
12765040	12767040	Mama.
12767040	12769040	Oh.
12769040	12771040	I do hope little Mai really is indestructible.
12783040	12787040	Where in the world is this kite taking me?
12787040	12789040	All lonely mountains.
12789040	12791040	I'm a long way from home.
12791040	12793040	I'm a long way from home.
12793040	12795040	Little Mai.
12795040	12797040	Little Mai.
12797040	12799040	And now she's going towards the forest of witches.
12799040	12803040	She'll be all right if she fell into a tree when she...
12803040	12805040	I can't see her.
12805040	12807040	There's no sign of her.
12807040	12809040	Well, I'm almost sure she was heading this way.
12813040	12815040	What is it, Sniff?
12815040	12817040	Imagine she might have fallen somewhere.
12817040	12819040	She might be lying there waiting for help.
12819040	12821040	Oh, stop imagining things, Sniff.
12821040	12823040	She's still up there.
12823040	12825040	I'm sure of it.
12825040	12827040	Huh?
12827040	12829040	What is it, Papa?
12829040	12831040	I saw something up there.
12831040	12833040	Little Mai?
12833040	12835040	No, Sniff.
12835040	12837040	No, it looked more like the Harb Goblin riding his panther through the sky.
12837040	12839040	Really?
12839040	12841040	Did you see that?
12841040	12843040	Did you?
12843040	12845040	You found the Mai.
12845040	12847040	No, the Harb Goblin.
12847040	12848040	Then it was him.
12848040	12850040	Now, Harb Goblin, we're looking for Little Mai.
12850040	12852040	And all you can think of is the Harb Goblin.
12862040	12864040	Oh, come on.
12864040	12866040	I won't you come in.
12878040	12880040	Stop!
12880040	12882040	Stop it!
12882040	12884040	Stop it!
12884040	12886040	Let's go right here!
12886040	12888040	Stop!
12898040	12900040	Where could she be?
12900040	12902040	This is no good.
12902040	12906040	We'll never find her wondering about like this.
12906040	12908040	Moomin, over here.
12908040	12910040	You found her?
12914040	12916040	There she is.
12922040	12924040	Try to cheer up, Snork Maiden.
12924040	12926040	I'll try.
12926040	12928040	Don't worry, Snork Maiden.
12928040	12930040	Moomin, Papa, will find her for sure.
12930040	12932040	Eh?
12932040	12936040	Mama, Snork Maiden!
12936040	12938040	I'm so glad to see you.
12938040	12942040	But I just knew you'd be all right.
12942040	12946040	Like Moomin Mama said, Little Mai really is indestructible.
12946040	12950040	But just possibly it served her right to have her hair pulled.
12962040	12964040	There's still no sign of Little Mai?
12964040	12966040	No.
12972040	12974040	Be careful, Moomin!
12980040	12982040	Come on!
12986040	12988040	Hang on, Moomin!
12988040	12990040	To me, Moomin Papa!
12992040	12996040	Finally, Moomin was rescued too.
12996040	13000040	But he almost certainly had a fine worst scare than Little Mai.
13004040	13010040	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
13010040	13018040	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
13018040	13022040	They're always happy and goes at play.
13022040	13026040	The Moons are having fun day after day.
13026040	13030040	The Moons!
13030040	13034040	The Moons!
13034040	13038040	The Moons!
13048040	13052040	The Moons!
13078040	13082040	So come with me, give me your hand.
13082040	13084040	I'll take you up to Moomin Land.
13084040	13088040	You can fly just like a bird.
13088040	13090040	Sing that song ever.
13090040	13092040	There were the Moons!
13092040	13096040	There were the Moons!
13096040	13098040	There were the Moons!
13098040	13102040	There were the Moons!
13102040	13104040	There were the Moons!
13104040	13108040	There were the Moons!
13122040	13126040	These days, Moomin and Snuffkin were together even more than ever.
13134040	13138040	Winter would hit Moomin valley any day now.
13138040	13142040	And then they would have to part.
13142040	13148040	Moomin to go into hibernation and Snuffkin to leave for his trip south.
13150040	13154040	Little Mai, you look sad for something upset you?
13154040	13156040	Where are you off to, Moomin?
13156040	13158040	To the lonely mountains.
13158040	13162040	How come you two were always stealing off somewhere?
13162040	13164040	We're not stealing off.
13164040	13166040	We're just going for a walk to lonely mountains.
13166040	13168040	Just the two of you?
13168040	13172040	You're even worse than usual, never taking any of us with you.
13172040	13174040	I hadn't noticed are we really doing that?
13174040	13176040	I'm not sure, maybe we are.
13176040	13178040	No, maybe's about it.
13178040	13180040	Let me tell you, it's very rude.
13180040	13182040	But we were just off for a walk.
13182040	13184040	I know.
13184040	13186040	Well then, why are you going?
13186040	13188040	It'll start snowing any day now, little Mai,
13188040	13190040	and then we won't be able to go anywhere, will we?
13190040	13192040	Look at Moomin Valley from above before that happens.
13192040	13194040	A likely story.
13194040	13196040	But it's true, I'm off very soon,
13196040	13200040	and I wanted to see it all, to give me a picture to remember while I'm walking.
13200040	13202040	Hmm.
13202040	13204040	Did you hear that, Snuffkin?
13208040	13210040	Moomin, do you mind if we come along with you?
13210040	13212040	Of course not.
13212040	13214040	You see, we thought you were probably plotting something secret
13214040	13216040	and weren't letting any of us in on it.
13216040	13218040	Oh, come on, we don't have any secrets from you.
13218040	13220040	It's just a, well, you know what I mean.
13220040	13222040	Snuffkin will be leaving for months, months very soon.
13222040	13224040	Never mind, off we go.
13232040	13236040	It would be fun to see it all from here in the middle of winter all white.
13236040	13238040	Must be very beautiful.
13238040	13240040	I don't think so.
13240040	13242040	With everything white and clean.
13242040	13244040	In summer, it's very beautiful.
13244040	13246040	Well, I'm coming back here in winter.
13246040	13250040	Well, I'm coming back here in winter to see it for myself.
13250040	13252040	You can't do that, you're hibernating.
13252040	13254040	Well, maybe not.
13254040	13256040	I thought that this year I tried to keep awake all winter.
13256040	13258040	You mean just like Moomin and I did last year?
13258040	13260040	Yes!
13260040	13262040	You could never do it.
13262040	13264040	What about you? Are you hibernating?
13264040	13268040	I'm not all that mad about the snow and the cold and darks all hibernate.
13270040	13272040	I'm very happy to be going home.
13272040	13274040	I've seen it all now.
13274040	13276040	Well, we didn't ask you to come along little life.
13276040	13280040	Well, I know we go take a look at that beautiful lake against Sniff.
13280040	13282040	The one with the golden fish.
13282040	13284040	Oh, no, that's too far away.
13284040	13286040	Ah, you're just afraid of the forest of witches, aren't you, Sniff?
13286040	13288040	Not at all, I'm not a bit scared.
13288040	13292040	Hey, look! Who's that?
13296040	13298040	Nobody, I know.
13298040	13300040	Wonder what she's doing here.
13300040	13302040	Sitting down.
13302040	13304040	Hello there.
13304040	13306040	Right there.
13306040	13308040	What are you doing up there?
13308040	13310040	Ah, I'm waiting.
13310040	13312040	For what? For grandma?
13312040	13314040	Out here all alone.
13314040	13318040	Well, grandma told me there was a big rock by the path leading up to Lonely Mountains and to wait there.
13318040	13322040	But there are other rocks by the path, you know?
13322040	13324040	Or there?
13324040	13328040	But this is the only one I've seen so far.
13328040	13332040	Your grandma must be crazy or something making you wait in a place like this.
13332040	13336040	No, our house is in the forest and she's coming to show me the way.
13336040	13338040	In the forest?
13338040	13340040	You mean the forest of witches?
13340040	13342040	Yes, I suppose so.
13342040	13344040	It's not very far from here.
13344040	13346040	That's it, definitely.
13346040	13348040	How long have you been waiting here?
13348040	13350040	Oh, about an hour.
13350040	13352040	One hour?
13352040	13354040	She's not very punctual.
13354040	13356040	Perhaps I was early.
13356040	13358040	Yes, she was an hour early.
13358040	13360040	Oh, it's grandma.
13362040	13364040	Welcome, Alicia.
13368040	13372040	Where do you find all these children, my dear?
13372040	13376040	I was waiting here all alone and then they came along the path and wanted to help.
13376040	13378040	Very kind of you, I'm sure.
13378040	13380040	Well, don't just stand there, my dear.
13380040	13382040	Let's go.
13382040	13384040	Come along.
13388040	13390040	Excuse me, ma'am.
13390040	13392040	But don't you live in the forest?
13392040	13394040	Indeed, I do.
13394040	13396040	In what part of it?
13396040	13398040	Let me see.
13398040	13400040	It must be about right in the middle.
13400040	13402040	Interesting.
13402040	13404040	The only place I know of is an old house.
13404040	13408040	The only place I know of is an old house where they say which is used to live.
13408040	13410040	You don't say a man.
13410040	13412040	Well, what do you know?
13412040	13414040	What will he think of next?
13426040	13428040	Her grandmother is...
13428040	13430040	A witch, I think?
13430040	13432040	But surely, they don't exist.
13432040	13436040	Of course not, like dragons don't exist.
13436040	13438040	Well, she doesn't seem like a nasty one.
13438040	13440040	How can you tell, Moments?
13440040	13444040	I don't think that nice girl would have a bad one for a grandma.
13444040	13446040	Perhaps not.
13446040	13450040	So tell me what makes you think she's a witch, eh?
13450040	13454040	Who else could live in that forest, Papa?
13454040	13456040	I can't think of anyone right now, but some people would like it.
13456040	13458040	Yes, I suppose you're right.
13458040	13460040	I hope you are.
13460040	13464040	Well, I've lived in Moomin Valley for a long time and I've never once seen a witch.
13464040	13466040	So they don't exist?
13470040	13472040	Yes.
13472040	13474040	Oh, stop working now, Snork. Dinner's ready.
13474040	13476040	Fine, coming.
13480040	13482040	No wonder it's so light. Look, the moon is up.
13482040	13484040	Snork, Maiden.
13484040	13488040	I think it would be very wise for you to stay with the Moomin's from tonight on.
13488040	13490040	Why on earth do you think that's Snork?
13490040	13494040	I've decided not to hibernate this winter.
13494040	13496040	Why ever not?
13496040	13500040	I want to complete the blueprint for my new flying ship by next spring.
13500040	13504040	For a real inventor, sleep is an unnecessary luxury.
13504040	13508040	Science, my dear Snork Maiden, will not wait while inventors take a nap.
13508040	13512040	But you know, dear Snork, how dependent you are on your sleep.
13512040	13514040	I'll stay with you.
13514040	13517040	Very well, then, this winter I will hibernate with the Moomin's.
13517040	13521040	Excellent. Shall we have dinner? I'm ready now.
13531040	13535040	Well, certainly, Snork. Snork Maiden will be just fine here with us.
13535040	13537040	Thank you.
13537040	13541040	This is nice for Moomin, too. Now he'll have Snork Maiden to keep him company.
13541040	13543040	Yes.
13543040	13547040	But who needs company when they're hibernating? After all, Moomin will be fast asleep.
13547040	13549040	Never the less.
13549040	13553040	Sleeping is much nicer when someone else sleeps in the same room.
13553040	13555040	When do we start hibernating, do you think?
13555040	13557040	With weather like this in another few days, I guess.
13557040	13559040	So early?
13559040	13561040	We'll have snow before the week is out.
13561040	13563040	Well, good luck with your new blueprint, Snork.
13563040	13567040	I look forward to seeing your flying ship in the spring.
13567040	13571040	Come this time next year. I'll definitely be flying about.
13574040	13579040	Thanks again for taking Snork Maiden. That's not trouble at all. Good night, then.
13579040	13581040	Good night, Snork.
13581040	13583040	See you, Snork Maiden.
13583040	13587040	Good luck this winter, Snork.
13591040	13597040	Thank goodness that last I can really concentrate on my work.
13604040	13607040	I don't believe this.
13611040	13613040	Am I hallucinating?
13627040	13629040	Oh!
13634040	13640040	Oh, which I'm sure it was. I'm positive. I'm a broomstick.
13640040	13645040	When the snork gets an idea in his head, it's not much room for anyone or anything else.
13645040	13648040	I hope you'll succeed this time.
13648040	13651040	At least in my dream that rounding really flew well.
13651040	13655040	I often dream that I fly, but I wouldn't dream of trying it out.
13655040	13659040	Snork must have had some sort of a new idea.
13659040	13661040	It's Snork.
13664040	13668040	What's the matter?
13676040	13680040	Oh, that's my piece of cake.
13680040	13683040	You look like you've seen a ghost.
13683040	13686040	Not a ghost. She laughed at me.
13686040	13689040	Where did? She was flying on a broom.
13689040	13690040	No engine at all.
13690040	13692040	Are you talking about the witch?
13692040	13696040	I can't use this no point if you can do it so easily.
13696040	13698040	We're going to jump together.
13698040	13699040	You really swore?
13699040	13700040	Yes.
13700040	13701040	But where?
13701040	13703040	Right near here.
13709040	13714040	I can't see any witch up there, Snork. Just the moon up in the sky.
13723040	13727040	And she was really flying in the sky? Is that what Snork said?
13727040	13730040	Well, he should know about things that fly.
13730040	13733040	But I just can't believe it until I've seen it myself.
13733040	13736040	If she really is a witch, then what about the girl?
13736040	13739040	I mean, no one could be happy living with a witch.
13739040	13742040	I really don't know. I thought witches had to be old.
13742040	13746040	Maybe it's not her real grandmother. She could be adopted.
13746040	13749040	Well, moment, we must get to the bottom of this.
13749040	13751040	Yes, Snuffkin. We must.
13753040	13754040	Hmm.
13758040	13761040	Ha, I caught you at it again, you and your secret plan.
13761040	13763040	Where are you going?
13763040	13765040	Today you can't come with us with a little fly.
13765040	13766040	And why not?
13766040	13768040	Because we're going on a dangerous mission.
13768040	13770040	We're going to the forest of witches.
13770040	13775040	Well, if you're in any danger, then I must certainly come along to look after you, Moon.
13775040	13776040	Come on.
13778040	13781040	Besides, nothing's exciting to happen to me since I went up with that kite.
13782040	13784040	This is so exciting.
13784040	13789040	Ha, sleeping only through a set of four that I must cram in one adventure first.
13789040	13792040	This is what we'll do. I grabbed the witch and while she's helpless,
13792040	13794040	you two grabbed the girl and whisk her away to safety.
13794040	13798040	That sounds great, but we don't know if she is a witch, little Mai.
13798040	13803040	If we grab her and she isn't a witch, it would be embarrassing and we could all be in trouble.
13803040	13808040	Maybe the witch needed an innocent maiden to try out some potions to experiment on her.
13808040	13810040	Maybe, let's find out.
13810040	13811040	How do we find out?
13811040	13813040	By snooping around, I suppose.
13813040	13817040	I hope you'll think of something a bit better than that before we get there.
13817040	13822040	Let's hide as close to the house as we can and then ask the girl as soon as she comes out.
13823040	13826040	And what if she doesn't come out, Snuffkin?
13826040	13828040	Then we'll improvise, little Mai.
13828040	13831040	So this is the famous plan by the great Snuffkin.
13831040	13836040	Look, if she doesn't come out of the house, we'll just go up and knock on the door.
13837040	13841040	Once we're inside, I'm sure we'll be able to tell what's really what.
13841040	13844040	I don't think it's a very good idea.
13844040	13846040	What if she can't just spell on us?
13846040	13851040	Little Mai will wait outside and if we don't come out, she can run back to Moomin Valley for help.
13851040	13855040	That's fine, but Moomin can wait outside and I'll search the house.
13855040	13858040	Oh no, little Mai, you can wait outside and I will search the house.
13858040	13860040	Let's do it this way.
13860040	13863040	You stay outside and if we get caught, try to free us.
13863040	13866040	And run for help as quickly as you can only if you can't.
13866040	13868040	Is that okay?
13868040	13871040	Hmm, that means if you're in trouble, your lives will be in my hands.
13871040	13873040	That's right, little Mai.
13873040	13877040	I don't like this out of this. I'm not sure I want little Mai to be my last hope.
13877040	13880040	Well, I wouldn't help anyone who doesn't trust me, that's for sure.
13880040	13882040	Here's that? See what I mean?
13882040	13885040	Be quiet.
13885040	13887040	There's a house.
13887040	13894040	Look at this.
13894040	13897040	It's very quiet, do you think there's anybody home?
13897040	13900040	I don't know, let's wait a while and see.
13900040	13903040	Do we have to stay absolutely still?
13903040	13908040	But of course we do. We'll feel extremely silly if the house is empty.
13908040	13912040	They've disappeared. They could have told us where they were going.
13912040	13915040	I'm sure I don't care. Little Mai went too, I think.
13915040	13918040	She's betrayed us, that's just like her.
13918040	13921040	Don't worry, I've got a pretty good idea where they were heading for.
13921040	13925040	You know where they've gone? Why didn't you tell me? Where are they?
13925040	13928040	They've gone to the forest of witches.
13928040	13929040	What?
13929040	13932040	They've gone to see whether the woman we met yesterday is a real witch.
13932040	13934040	A real one?
13934040	13939040	Why don't we go there too? I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find my way, Sniff.
13939040	13941040	What is it?
13941040	13944040	I don't know, it's my stomach, I better lie down.
13944040	13949040	Oh, it's very painful.
13949040	13953040	Oh, how much longer we can have to stay here like this?
13953040	13956040	This adventure isn't the least bit exciting.
13956040	13958040	Well, let's wait a little bit longer. Be quiet.
13958040	13960040	At least we know the girl is definitely in there.
13960040	13964040	No, we don't. She might be out. She could be anywhere.
13964040	13967040	I know that's possible, but I don't think so.
13972040	13974040	She's getting some water.
13974040	13977040	As I thought, that way she's working her to the bone.
13977040	13979040	Hey, little boy.
13979040	13981040	She's following that girl.
13981040	13984040	You go with her, Moomin, and find out as much as you possibly can about what's going on.
13984040	13986040	I'll watch the house.
13986040	13988040	Right.
13989040	13992040	Hey, wait for me.
14002040	14004040	Oh.
14025040	14027040	Huh.
14031040	14034040	Oh.
14062040	14066040	If you're looking for Alicia, she's out.
14068040	14073040	Stop. Listen. Wait and see.
14073040	14076040	I wasn't doing anything wrong.
14076040	14079040	Why did you try to run away then?
14083040	14086040	Oh, I'll help you with that.
14086040	14087040	So will I.
14087040	14090040	How kind of you. It is a bit heavy to carry, you know.
14090040	14092040	I think I remember your name.
14092040	14093040	Is it Alicia?
14093040	14096040	Yes, it is. I'm so glad you remembered it.
14096040	14097040	My name is Moomin.
14097040	14098040	And I'm a little mind.
14098040	14100040	What are you doing here in the forest of witches?
14100040	14105040	Well, to be perfectly honest, we came because we were rather worried about you.
14105040	14107040	What about me? Why is that?
14107040	14110040	Is that a woman really your grandmother?
14110040	14111040	Of course.
14111040	14112040	You're quite sure?
14112040	14115040	Yes, of course. She's my mother's mother. Why do you ask?
14115040	14117040	Well, don't you know?
14118040	14120040	He's trying to ask.
14120040	14123040	Well, maybe your grandmother is a witch.
14123040	14125040	Yes, she is.
14125040	14126040	Of course.
14126040	14129040	Oh, I'm sorry. I was a bit taken aback.
14129040	14132040	You don't mind about your grandmother being a real witch?
14132040	14134040	Oh, no. That's what she is.
14134040	14138040	I was husband. I'm going to be one, two, and I'm grown up.
14138040	14142040	Oh, no. You couldn't. Well, you don't look anything like one.
14142040	14144040	Well, that's because I'm not one yet.
14144040	14147040	When you're born into a witch family, that's what you become.
14147040	14149040	But it's not that easy, you know.
14149040	14151040	Oh, this is too much.
14151040	14155040	Now, tell me, what are you doing here in the forest of witches?
14155040	14157040	You don't sound like a witch.
14157040	14159040	Oh, really? What do witches sound like?
14159040	14162040	Well, to be honest, you're the first one I've ever met in my whole life.
14162040	14165040	I'm sure that's just what you think, young man.
14165040	14168040	Is it true that the nice girl is really your granddaughter?
14168040	14171040	Certainly. A very promising young girl.
14171040	14174040	Honest and hardworking, and with a lot of training,
14174040	14176040	she will make an excellent witch someday.
14176040	14179040	But how can you possibly turn such a sweet girl into a witch?
14179040	14181040	The sweetest girls make the best witches.
14181040	14184040	Hello, didn't know you were back, grandma.
14184040	14186040	Thank you for getting the water, Alicia.
14186040	14188040	Oh, who's that?
14188040	14193040	I don't know. Some naive young man out to rescue a damsel in distress now.
14193040	14195040	I remember you, your snuffkin.
14195040	14197040	Yes.
14198040	14202040	Your friend snuffkins in here, why don't you come in, too?
14202040	14204040	In the house? Really?
14204040	14206040	He's brought friends with him, Addy.
14206040	14209040	Self-killed. Whatever they're done to you.
14209040	14211040	I'll take care of that.
14211040	14214040	Wait a second. I'll do it for you.
14214040	14215040	I'll fix it.
14221040	14223040	Wait. I'm gonna need you again.
14223040	14224040	Where'd you go in?
14224040	14227040	I don't think that snake ever got bitten before.
14227040	14229040	I'll get another.
14229040	14232040	I'm very curious. Why are you three here, huh?
14232040	14234040	They came all the way from Moomin Valley
14234040	14236040	because they were really worried about me, grandma.
14236040	14238040	Worried about you?
14238040	14240040	Yes. They thought you might be nasty to me
14240040	14243040	so they came all this way to see if I needed help.
14243040	14245040	This always happens.
14245040	14247040	People treat witches as if they weren't ordinary,
14247040	14250040	respectable, responsible citizens.
14250040	14252040	No, no. We're very sorry.
14252040	14254040	We realize she's quite okay
14254040	14257040	and she's most welcome to visit us in Moomin Valley
14257040	14259040	at any time, isn't she, Snuffkin?
14259040	14261040	Yes, certainly.
14261040	14264040	What? You said you'd visit these people?
14264040	14266040	Oh, yes. I thought I'd go over there sometimes
14266040	14269040	after I finished with my homework, of course.
14269040	14271040	I would never leave my studies half done.
14271040	14275040	Sorry, Alicia, but if you ever want to become a good witch,
14275040	14278040	you mustn't see any ordinary mortals.
14278040	14279040	Oh, why not?
14279040	14282040	I've only just become friends with them, grandma, please.
14282040	14284040	I know. Why don't I wait a year
14284040	14287040	and study to be a witch next year?
14287040	14289040	Alicia.
14291040	14293040	This is family business.
14293040	14295040	So if you don't mind, I would appreciate it
14295040	14297040	if you were to leave.
14297040	14300040	And I'd like you to go immediately if you please.
14310040	14313040	It's snowing.
14313040	14316040	Well, she certainly won't be able to visit us
14316040	14318040	at Moomin Valley is buried in snow,
14318040	14320040	so we might never see her again.
14320040	14322040	No, that's right.
14322040	14326040	And you'll be leaving soon, won't you, Snuffkin?
14326040	14330040	Winter had come once again to Moomin Valley.
14339040	14349040	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
14349040	14356040	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
14356040	14360040	They're always happy and goes at play.
14360040	14364040	The Moons are having fun day after day.
14364040	14367040	The Moons.
14367040	14371040	The Moons.
14371040	14377040	The Moons.
14398040	14402040	Here they are for one and all.
14402040	14405040	The Moomins are about to call.
14405040	14408040	Come on and sit down here with me.
14408040	14411040	They're here for you on your TV.
14411040	14414040	They are the movements.
14414040	14417040	They are the movements.
14417040	14420040	So come with me, give me your hand.
14420040	14423040	I'll take you up to Moomin Land.
14423040	14426040	You can fly just like a bird.
14426040	14428040	Sing thepass song ever.
14428040	14431040	There were the movements.
14431040	14434040	There were the movements.
14434040	14437040	There were the movements.
14437040	14440040	There was the movement.
14440040	14443040	There were the movements.
14443040	14447040	There were the movements.
14448040	14452040	The snow was getting thicker on the ground.
14452040	14456040	and it was high time for the movements to start hibernating.
14477040	14481040	What are you doing, new man? Alicia? What do you do with these pine needles?
14482040	14486040	That's what we always eat before we hibernate. Nobody knows why.
14486040	14488040	So you're going to start hibernating?
14488040	14489040	Yes, tonight.
14489040	14491040	Oh, that's soon?
14491040	14492040	Yes.
14492040	14496040	I'm so glad I've come to see you today instead of leaving until tomorrow then.
14497040	14500040	I must say you came on just the right day, Alicia.
14500040	14505040	We usually have a small party the night we start hibernating and you've arrived just in time.
14505040	14508040	Oh, you mean I can stay for that woman, Mama?
14509040	14515040	And by the way, Alicia is a matter of interest as to which, sorry, your grandmother, I mean, know that you're here?
14515040	14519040	No, I'm afraid I didn't tell her. Better for grown-ups not to know too much.
14519040	14521040	Oh, do you say you're right?
14521040	14524040	I'm afraid she's not very happy for me to come here to Moomin Valley.
14524040	14526040	Why ever not my dear?
14526040	14531040	I guess she's afraid that if I start coming here to play, I shall lose interest in studying hard at my witchcraft.
14531040	14535040	Oh, but you've got a very long time to go before you're a witch?
14535040	14539040	It takes anything between five to seven years nowadays.
14539040	14542040	Are you really sure that's what you want to be, Alicia?
14542040	14543040	Study something out.
14543040	14545040	But I want to be a witch.
14545040	14548040	Perhaps you don't know, but witches aren't terribly popular.
14548040	14552040	Yes, I do, but I won't be like that. I'll be popular.
14554040	14557040	Hey, Snuffkin!
14559040	14561040	You're off to the moments?
14561040	14562040	Yes.
14563040	14565040	I thought you'd gone south already.
14565040	14568040	Last winter you'd gone before the snow started.
14568040	14570040	Not this year, I promised Moomin.
14570040	14571040	Promise?
14571040	14574040	I promised not to leave Moomin Valley until he went into hibernation.
14579040	14582040	Everybody seems to be here, and somebody new.
14582040	14583040	Who's that?
14583040	14585040	Have a guess.
14585040	14588040	Very well, then. It's Alicia, that's my guess.
14588040	14590040	How did you know?
14590040	14592040	What? I'm right?
14592040	14595040	Yes, you are, but I think you peaked and saw her earlier on.
14595040	14599040	I did it. I just named somebody I thought couldn't be here.
14599040	14600040	Clever, huh?
14600040	14604040	Well, she just happened to stop by. She's with Papa, who's showing her around the house.
14604040	14606040	Is the witch here, too?
14606040	14609040	No, she didn't tell the witch she was coming here.
14609040	14611040	Just as well. Thank goodness.
14614040	14619040	Ah, it's you, Snuffkin. I finally came over. I told you I would.
14619040	14620040	Hi.
14620040	14623040	Remember our friend here? He's called Sniff.
14623040	14625040	Hi. How do you do Sniff?
14625040	14630040	Well, you aren't going to use your magic to cast any spells and stuff, are you?
14630040	14632040	No.
14637040	14641040	Actually, they didn't need just pine needles for dinner that evening.
14641040	14645040	They had lots of other nice things, too. All cooked by Moomin Mama.
14645040	14648040	Snuffkin, I'd like to say how story I am.
14648040	14649040	Why?
14649040	14653040	I persuaded you to stay on here instead of going south as you'd planned.
14653040	14655040	I'm leaving tomorrow.
14655040	14657040	But the snow is quite deep.
14657040	14660040	Don't worry, I'm used to deep snow.
14660040	14663040	I'm just worried Alicia will find it hard to get home in this.
14663040	14668040	Well, she could spell the night here, but of course tomorrow will be asleep for the winter, so...
14672040	14673040	Huh?
14673040	14675040	Hmm? Someone's at the door.
14675040	14677040	I'll see who it is.
14678040	14685040	Oh, hello. How are you?
14685040	14691040	Hello indeed, my young man. My granddaughter is here, isn't she?
14691040	14694040	Who is it then, Moomin?
14694040	14696040	Oh, my dear.
14696040	14698040	You must be Moomin Papa.
14702040	14704040	Now, you listen to me, Moomin Papa.
14704040	14708040	I don't want my granddaughter playing with your children under any circumstances.
14708040	14710040	Do I make myself quite clear?
14710040	14712040	But Alicia likes playing with us.
14712040	14713040	Grandma!
14713040	14716040	We're leaving. Can't I stay a little longer?
14716040	14719040	Hello, you're most welcome to stay and have dinner with us.
14719040	14723040	Don't you know I'm a witch? I can't eat that sort of baby food.
14723040	14725040	Alicia quite likes the food.
14725040	14729040	The pine needles look okay. The rest is yucky. Come, Alicia.
14729040	14731040	Please let me stay, Grandma.
14732040	14735040	I've told you before, which is never mixed with people like this,
14735040	14737040	and that goes for novice, which is as well.
14737040	14738040	Never.
14738040	14740040	With their knives, they're really all, Grandma.
14740040	14742040	And I told you, that's the trouble.
14742040	14745040	They are disgustingly, signally good.
14746040	14749040	You will hear a lot more about this when we get home.
14749040	14751040	Come on now.
14751040	14755040	It's really cold out here, and there's a lot more snow on the way.
14756040	14758040	All right, I'm coming, Grandma.
14758040	14759040	Coming.
14759040	14761040	Oh, thank you.
14761040	14762040	Mum and Papa.
14762040	14763040	Yeah?
14763040	14765040	We understand each other now, don't we?
14765040	14767040	I'm sure you understand me.
14767040	14769040	Never mind about that.
14769040	14772040	You and your whole family are never to speak to my granddaughter again.
14772040	14774040	Is that understood?
14774040	14776040	But Grandma!
14776040	14779040	Mind what I say over a vengeance of touch will come upon you,
14779040	14781040	or even the revenge of a serious.
14781040	14784040	If you think cheap threats like that impress Mum and Papa,
14784040	14786040	you're making a grave mistake.
14786040	14789040	Mum and Papa is a highly educated gentleman.
14789040	14792040	But I am a witch with three diplomas.
14792040	14793040	Maybe so.
14793040	14797040	But tell me, how can three diplomas help you to get home with all this snow?
14797040	14800040	Ha! Child's play to an accredited witch.
14800040	14802040	Come, Alicia.
14804040	14807040	I've never seen one of these before, a little pep square.
14808040	14810040	Is that really a witch's broom?
14810040	14811040	Well, I never.
14811040	14813040	Let's go and see.
14817040	14818040	I'm ready!
14818040	14819040	Hold on tight, Alicia.
14819040	14820040	Okay.
14820040	14823040	Can you both ride on that broom?
14823040	14825040	It looks pretty scrappy to me.
14825040	14827040	Could fall to pieces any minute.
14827040	14829040	Do drive slowly in this weather.
14829040	14832040	Oh, please don't fall off, Alicia.
14832040	14834040	But terrible chatterboxes you all are.
14834040	14837040	Please keep quiet out of you.
14837040	14839040	Are you ready, girl?
14839040	14840040	Yeah?
14840040	14842040	Bet they'll never be able to take off.
14842040	14843040	Huh?
14843040	14844040	Ha!
14844040	14846040	Ha!
14866040	14867040	What is it, Grandma?
14867040	14868040	Nothing.
14868040	14869040	Oh!
14872040	14874040	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
14874040	14876040	Just what I thought, they're too heavy.
14876040	14880040	Listen, I could take Alicia's place, I'm not too heavy.
14880040	14883040	Don't worry, I'm happy to walk home, Grandma.
14883040	14885040	Don't be so ridiculous, child.
14885040	14887040	You can't walk home in all this snow.
14887040	14888040	You'll never make it.
14888040	14889040	Only I had some skis.
14889040	14891040	Come on, climb aboard.
14891040	14893040	I'll try another spell.
14893040	14896040	Grandma, are you worried because all those people are watching you?
14896040	14897040	Shut up!
14897040	14899040	I help you say the magic spell.
14899040	14900040	Ah!
14900040	14901040	Ah!
14901040	14902040	Oh, hi!
14902040	14903040	Oh!
14903040	14904040	Oh!
14904040	14905040	Oh!
14905040	14906040	Oh!
14906040	14907040	Oh!
14907040	14908040	Oh!
14908040	14909040	Oh!
14909040	14910040	Oh!
14910040	14911040	Oh!
14911040	14912040	Oh!
14912040	14914040	They're doing it!
14914040	14915040	Oh!
14915040	14916040	Oh!
14916040	14917040	Oh!
14917040	14918040	What?
14918040	14919040	Oh!
14919040	14920040	Oh!
14920040	14921040	Oh!
14921040	14922040	Oh!
14922040	14923040	Oh!
14923040	14924040	Oh!
14924040	14925040	Oh!
14925040	14926040	Oh!
14926040	14927040	Oh!
14927040	14929040	Oh!
14929040	14930540	Where are we going?
14930540	14931540	Oh!
14931540	14932540	Ah!
14932540	14933540	Oh!
14933540	14934540	Oh!
14934540	14935540	Oh!
14935540	14936540	Oh!
14939540	14940540	Oh!
14940540	14941540	Oh!
14941540	14942540	Wow!
14942540	14943540	One!
14943540	14944540	Will you marry everybody goodbye?
14944540	14945540	Wow!
14945540	14946540	Oh!
14946540	14947540	Wow!
14947540	14948540	That's a z fix!
14948540	14952540	She may have three diplomas, but I don't think she's very good, Mama.
14952540	14957780	But I don't think she's very good mama. I wish they'd sing to the ground so I could fly that room
14957980	14961740	Guess they're all right now, woman papa. Let's go back to our dinner
14970740	14974300	Oh, I forgot to thank them for asking me to stand a dinner
14974780	14980640	Thank them indeed. I don't think you're cut out to be a witch over grandma. I don't want to be one
14980640	14984520	Well, I'm quite happy to help with the path will certainly be a difficult one
15010640	15030080	With Alessia and the witch gone home to the Valley of the Witches Snuffkin departed for his trip south and the Moomins went into hibernation
15041480	15049280	They certainly would have slept till the beginning of the spring is usual, but this year
15058240	15061040	Quite unexpectedly something happened
15070640	15072640	Oh
15101640	15103640	Oh
15109920	15111920	Spring here already
15117240	15119240	There's someone at the window
15120080	15122080	Oh
15128120	15130120	It's frozen shut
15139640	15146200	Hey, why did you wake me up? Well, you shouldn't be asleep. Didn't you know Christmas is coming?
15146480	15149080	It's tomorrow, so there's not a minute to be lost
15149880	15153000	Christmas is coming tomorrow, but who on earth is that?
15153560	15159000	Why who is Christmas? This isn't a joke moment. I'm not in the least ready
15159000	15165920	I've lost my mittens and Christmas is coming and I haven't got a firtry yet a firtry. I really must get a firtry
15169240	15172280	How very odd why a firtry
15173240	15175240	Hey
15175240	15177240	Why
15181240	15185520	Well Christmas is almost coming and we don't have a firtry yet Christmas
15186640	15193800	Hmm. Did you say Christmas is coming? Yes, and before that, why must have a firtry? What's this about a firtry?
15194320	15200600	We need one to protect ourselves against this Christmas person moment mama. I am not really quite clear on that point
15200600	15203440	But there's something awful that has to be kept away, right?
15206200	15208200	I better go get a firtry
15222920	15228920	Ha about the time you movements got up. How are you, Gafsey? Pretty good firtry, Dad
15229640	15231640	Oh
15231640	15235840	Thank you, Gafsey, but could you tell me something and what is one supposed to do with it?
15239120	15243580	Really moving papa the way you can joke with such a straight face
15244320	15249200	Joke hey love to stay, but I haven't even finished cooking yet
15252880	15255480	Wasn't joking no one believe me either
15258920	15262920	Would you like a little more, young man?
15262920	15266920	No, thank you very much. I'm really nice and warm again now.
15266920	15270920	I saw Moan Papa and Moan bring up a big tree!
15270920	15272920	But what is one supposed to do with it?
15272920	15274920	Don't you know? No.
15274920	15278920	Why, you decorate it as beautifully as you can.
15278920	15280920	Really?
15283920	15286920	Christmas is coming, so I better be off.
15286920	15288920	Everyone's talking of Christmas.
15288920	15290920	By now, I've got a long way to go.
15292920	15294920	Take care, dear.
15300920	15302920	Hello.
15302920	15304920	Hello.
15306920	15308920	Bye-bye!
15308920	15310920	Bye-bye!
15312920	15314920	Who was that?
15314920	15318920	He was in a hurry to get somewhere before Christmas, so I gave him some tea.
15318920	15320920	Well, that was nice.
15320920	15322920	And he told us what to do with the fir tree.
15322920	15324920	What did he say?
15324920	15326920	To decorate it beautifully.
15326920	15328920	Decorate it, but why should we do that, Moan?
15328920	15332920	I guess we must decorate the tree to make sure we keep Christmas happy.
15332920	15334920	Yes, you're right.
15334920	15336920	We'd better start doing it right away.
15336920	15338920	Yes, I'm sure there's not a moment to lose.
15338920	15340920	No.
15340920	15342920	Yes, dear.
15342920	15344920	They also say we have to cook lots of food for Christmas.
15344920	15346920	Goodness.
15346920	15348920	Well, at least he won't be eating us then.
15358920	15360920	Here.
15360920	15362920	Thank you, Snorkmaid.
15362920	15364920	The ship means rather a lot to me.
15364920	15366920	It will look fantastic on the tree, Papa.
15366920	15368920	Yes, dear. I suppose you're right.
15370920	15380920	Oh, why don't we put this at the top?
15380920	15382920	This is Mars.
15382920	15386920	Don't worry.
15386920	15390920	That looks beautiful.
15390920	15392920	Listen, everybody.
15392920	15396920	I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas too.
15396920	15398920	Really, Mama?
15398920	15402920	I don't wonder what this Christmas will be like.
15402920	15406920	What if it's an awful greedy, beastly monster like the grove?
15406920	15408920	Don't worry, Snorkmaid.
15408920	15412920	We'll give him lots of presents and stuff him full of food.
15414920	15418920	Have you thought of any presents for Christmas yet?
15418920	15420920	I don't know what to give him.
15420920	15422920	Look, a seashell.
15422920	15426920	Oh, that's a beauty.
15427920	15430920	Oh, look, Mama, what I got for Christmas.
15430920	15433920	I'm going to give him a pretty lure for fishing.
15433920	15435920	I'm giving him this book.
15435920	15442920	Great presents. I'm sure he'll be very happy with the moment family and not Thomas at all.
15450920	15453920	I think Christmas will come any moment now.
15453920	15455920	So do I.
15455920	15459920	Oh, dear. I do hope he likes my pumpkin pie.
15459920	15461920	He will.
15461920	15465920	Imagine everyone in Moomin Valley being frightened.
15473920	15475920	Are you sleepy?
15475920	15477920	Yes, I am.
15477920	15479920	I can't stay this scared for much longer.
15479920	15483920	Better come before all the food freezes.
15483920	15489920	Oh, he's coming.
15491920	15495920	I never thought Christmas could be that small.
15495920	15497920	Merry Christmas.
15497920	15500920	Merry Christmas. Is that what he is?
15500920	15502920	Well, it's just what you say.
15502920	15506920	All of my life I have dreamed of seeing all this up close, honestly.
15506920	15510920	I never really thought a Christmas tree could be this beautiful.
15510920	15512920	Brought my friends, too.
15512920	15514920	You're all very welcome.
15514920	15517920	Oh, thank you. Hear that, everybody.
15517920	15519920	We're all very welcome.
15519920	15521920	Oh, man, let's get them.
15521920	15523920	There's some wonderful things here.
15525920	15528920	Oh, what a lot of food you've made.
15528920	15530920	Yes, all the food there is for Christmas.
15530920	15533920	And are those real presents?
15533920	15535920	They are.
15535920	15539920	All of my life, I've sort of wondered about those things called presents.
15539920	15542920	Papa, I don't think these creatures are Christmas.
15542920	15545920	Neither do I.
15552920	15554920	You look sleepy, Mama.
15554920	15558920	I am. Must be well past midnight.
15558920	15561920	What is Christmas doing, Mama?
15561920	15563920	Aren't you sleepy, two little ones?
15563920	15568920	Sleepy with a wonderful Christmas tree like this to look at?
15570920	15571920	Hey, Papa.
15571920	15572920	What is it?
15572920	15575920	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
15575920	15578920	Maybe.
15578920	15581920	Nobody can get really angry this late at night.
15581920	15585920	Surely we'll close the doors and perhaps we'll be safe inside.
15585920	15587920	I'm sure you're right.
15587920	15591920	Listen, my friends, we'd like to give you the tree and the food and the presents.
15591920	15594920	What? All of this?
15594920	15595920	For us?
15595920	15597920	Yes, we want to sleep.
15597920	15599920	We're far more sleepy than scared.
15602920	15604920	Snork, madam.
15604920	15606920	Oh, I see here yet.
15606920	15609920	No, but we decided to go back to hibernating.
15618920	15620920	Papa!
15626920	15630920	I thought Christmas tree should have a star on top.
15630920	15633920	I don't think it makes any difference, you know?
15633920	15636920	A nice rose is just as good as a star.
15636920	15638920	Look at that!
15656920	15658920	Hi!
15661920	15664920	And apparently it didn't make any difference at all
15664920	15669920	because the Moonman family slept as peacefully as ever all through the night
15669920	15673920	without Christmas coming anywhere near them.
15673920	15676920	So probably he went someplace else.
15677920	15685920	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
15685920	15693920	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
15693920	15697920	They're always happy and goes at play.
15697920	15704920	The Moons are having fun day after day, the Moons.
15704920	15707920	The Moons.
15707920	15710920	The Moons.
15735920	15739920	Here they are for one and all.
15739920	15742920	The Moons are about to call.
15742920	15745920	Come on and sit down here with me.
15745920	15748920	They're here for you on your TV.
15748920	15750920	They are the movements.
15750920	15753920	They are the movements.
15753920	15757920	So come with me, give me your hand.
15757920	15760920	I'll take you up to a movement land.
15760920	15763920	You can fly just like a bird.
15763920	15765920	Sing with the song ever.
15765920	15768920	They're with the movement.
15768920	15771920	They're with the movements.
15771920	15774920	They're with the movements.
15774920	15777920	They're with the movements.
15777920	15780920	They're with the movements.
15780920	15783920	They're with the movements.
15793920	15795920	During his long winter sleep,
15795920	15805920	the woman had a dream.
15809920	15813920	And strangely enough, he dreamt that he was sleeping.
15813920	15817920	Moment! Moment! Moment!
15817920	15819920	Huh?
15823920	15829920	Alicia! Alicia! Wow! You can fly on the broomstick now!
15829920	15833920	That's right! I'm a fully fledged witch now, Moment!
15833920	15837920	Wait! Give me a ride, Alicia! Can't do that!
15837920	15841920	Oh, don't be mean, Alicia! Because someone's already riding with me!
15841920	15843920	Oops! Man, it's me!
15843920	15845920	Haha! Little boy!
15845920	15849920	Would you mind if we went a little higher, Alicia? Sure!
15849920	15851920	Oh, wow! Why, Alicia!
15851920	15853920	Oh, you're keeping me going!
15853920	15855920	What?
15855920	15857920	Oh, please, listen!
15857920	15861920	Come back! Please! Give me a ride, Alicia!
15861920	15863920	Haha!
15863920	15865920	Oh!
15865920	15867920	Yeah!
15875920	15877920	Oh, thank you, woman!
15879920	15881920	Will you give me a ride now?
15881920	15883920	Come on, now!
15899920	15903920	Moment, Val, he's really beautiful from up here.
15903920	15905920	Yes, lovely!
15905920	15907920	Oh, Alicia, be careful! Don't do things like that!
15907920	15909920	What are you talking about?
15909920	15911920	We're not doing anything, woman!
15911920	15913920	A little boy, it's you again!
15913920	15915920	No wonder the broom is shaking so much!
15915920	15919920	How do you like it? I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?
15919920	15921920	Where did you get this broom from, little boy?
15921920	15923920	I borrowed it from the witch!
15923920	15925920	I borrowed it for a while!
15925920	15927920	That's the witch, isn't it?
15927920	15929920	Looks like it!
15929920	15931920	Maybe we better get out of here!
15931920	15933920	You're right! Stop!
15933920	15935920	You two little thieves! Give me back my bread at once!
15935920	15937920	No!
15937920	15939920	Yeah!
15939920	15941920	You have your own broom!
15941920	15943920	You witches should learn how to share!
15943920	15945920	But it's not the one who's just a spare!
15945920	15947920	I want my veil from back right now!
15947920	15949920	Finders, keepers, it's my broom!
15949920	15951920	Cut out a broom?
15951920	15953920	Huh! Why don't you take a closer look at it?
15953920	15955920	That's not a broom, huh?
15955920	15957920	What do you mean this is not a broom?
15957920	15959920	Oh!
15961920	15963920	Oh!
15963920	15965920	Oh!
15965920	15967920	Oh, little boy!
15967920	15969920	Hey!
15969920	15971920	Little boy!
15971920	15973920	You're right, little boy!
15973920	15975920	Little boy, isn't he, or a little boy?
15975920	15977920	Oh! Oh!
15977920	15979920	I must have been dreaming!
15979920	15981920	You were yelling out loud!
15981920	15983920	Oh, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to wake you up, Snorkman!
15983920	15985920	Can you see anything?
15985920	15987920	Only snow!
15987920	15989920	Everything's so light!
15989920	15991920	Yes, the moon is up!
15991920	15993920	Oh, what an eerie light!
15993920	15995920	Yes!
15995920	15997920	Spring hasn't arrived yet, has it?
15997920	15999920	Not yet!
15999920	16001920	Everybody else is still asleep then?
16001920	16003920	Yes, most of them anyway!
16003920	16005920	Wonder if my brother's still up!
16005920	16007920	Well, he did say before we started hyprinating
16007920	16009920	he wanted to finish his blooper!
16009920	16011920	Before spring, if he could!
16011920	16013920	I hope he'll succeed this time!
16013920	16015920	When he go out!
16015920	16017920	Huh?
16017920	16019920	Outside, just to see what the snow looks like!
16019920	16021920	Oh, no!
16021920	16023920	I don't really feel like it!
16023920	16025920	It's nice and warm here!
16025920	16029920	Why don't we sleep till spring like the others?
16029920	16033920	Spring is still a long way off!
16033920	16035920	Guess you're right!
16035920	16037920	It is nice and warm in here!
16037920	16039920	It is nice and warm in here!
16039920	16041920	I don't really feel like it!
16041920	16043920	It is nice and warm in here!
16043920	16045920	Spring is still a long way off!
16045920	16047920	Spring is still a long way off!
16047920	16049920	Spring is still a long way off!
16049920	16051920	Spring is still a long way off!
16051920	16053920	Spring is still a long way off!
16053920	16055920	There!
16055920	16059920	It's delicious chocolate cakes my favorite!
16059920	16061920	Yes, I like it!
16061920	16063920	Did you say something, Snorkman?
16063920	16065920	I'm so very hungry moment!
16065920	16074920	Your mother's raspberry juice is really the best.
16074920	16077920	It is, isn't it? Everybody said that last winter too.
16077920	16078920	Hey, Moonman.
16078920	16079920	Yeah?
16079920	16082920	I have a funny feeling. Someone is watching us and I don't like you.
16082920	16083920	One little bit.
16083920	16085920	Moonman Papa could explain it.
16085920	16086920	I'm sure.
16086920	16087920	Of course someone's watching.
16087920	16089920	What the hell? And how do you know?
16089920	16092920	Too thick. He told me all about it last winter snort maiden.
16092920	16097920	She doesn't hibernate, you know. She lives in our bathhouse and watches over us in the winter.
16097920	16101920	She said that many things are too shy to show themselves.
16101920	16103920	Oh, have you seen them yourself?
16103920	16106920	Sort of. Except they were invisible, of course.
16106920	16108920	Like under the sink.
16108920	16110920	Or in the clock, maybe.
16110920	16115920	In the empty fireplace and other dark corners of the room, I can feel it.
16115920	16118920	Did you actually look anywhere for them?
16118920	16120920	Oh, no. They'd be very upset.
16120920	16123920	It's better not to let them know we know where they are.
16123920	16125920	I wonder what these things look like.
16125920	16128920	Some of them look very much like us, too, Tiki said.
16128920	16131920	Old ancestors of ours from way back, she thinks.
16131920	16133920	Some of them look like us, she said.
16133920	16135920	Well, I've never seen them for myself.
16135920	16138920	I wonder if there is good looking as we are.
16143920	16146920	Wouldn't it be a good idea to stay up and wait for the sunrise?
16146920	16148920	A great idea.
16151920	16160920	Now, don't say anything to scare them, but this is one of the movement's ancestors from way back.
16162920	16164920	Is it morning already?
16164920	16165920	Are you sure?
16165920	16166920	I think so.
16166920	16168920	There are no clouds, so why can't we see the sun?
16168920	16172920	I guess maybe the sun doesn't come up at all this time of the year.
16172920	16177920	Mom and I don't like this. I don't like your one little bit.
16178920	16181920	You silly little girl, what do you need this for?
16181920	16184920	Please grandma, I won't be long, I promise.
16184920	16187920	What are you talking about is if you could fly a broom,
16187920	16189920	get back back to me at once.
16189920	16191920	No, I won't give it back.
16191920	16193920	Now give me back that broom and don't be silly.
16193920	16196920	How many times from sight tell you you can't go visiting Moomin Valley?
16196920	16198920	But it's so boring here.
16198920	16200920	I want some company grandma.
16201920	16203920	Come on, broom fly off.
16203920	16205920	Take me to Moomin Valley.
16208920	16212920	Help me up grandma, please.
16214920	16217920	All right, my girl, I'll help you up, shall I?
16222920	16224920	I don't believe it, I'm floating.
16227920	16230920	How far? This is great.
16230920	16231920	Wait.
16231920	16233920	Oh, I'm falling.
16238920	16240920	Oh, how about that?
16240920	16242920	I'll find a bird around here.
16244920	16247920	Or to bury things again, how about this?
16247920	16250920	Oh no, stop the broom grandma, please.
16251920	16254920	Come on, you wanted to ride on the broom, didn't you?
16254920	16255920	You first saw the bike?
16255920	16256920	Well, we did.
16259920	16261920	Mom, please don't.
16267920	16270920	If you want to learn to fly on this broom, Alicia,
16270920	16272920	then forget all about those dreaded Moomin's
16272920	16274920	and really start studying.
16274920	16276920	It's hard work, you know, young woman.
16276920	16278920	You must learn to concentrate.
16284920	16285920	Hey, you up there.
16285920	16287920	Are you making fun of me, too?
16293920	16295920	Oh, I can't climb down there.
16295920	16297920	Of course you can, even if you fall.
16297920	16300920	You can't hurt yourself on this soft snow.
16300920	16302920	Don't shake the ladder, Moomin.
16302920	16303920	This is scary.
16303920	16305920	Slowly does it.
16305920	16307920	Take it easy and don't look down.
16307920	16310920	Maybe going out wasn't such a good idea after all.
16310920	16313920	We can always change our minds and go back to sleep, you know.
16313920	16315920	See, you've made it.
16315920	16318920	It's very cool though to hear Moomin, but I rather like it.
16321920	16324920	Oh, this is the roof over the front door, isn't it?
16324920	16327920	Yes, and everything will be snowed up now to spring.
16327920	16330920	Oh no, what's happened to our firewood?
16335920	16336920	What's the matter?
16336920	16338920	There's not much wood left in here.
16338920	16340920	Someone else must be burning it.
16340920	16343920	Yes, but who and for what I wonder?
16345920	16346920	I can feel it.
16346920	16347920	We're not alone in this forest.
16347920	16349920	I'm sure someone's watching us.
16349920	16351920	All those winter creatures.
16351920	16353920	No, I don't think it's them.
16355920	16357920	The grog.
16362920	16366920	Goodness me, look how big she gets in the wintertime.
16366920	16369920	Moomin, I'm scared.
16369920	16371920	It'll be all right.
16371920	16374920	Grog, stop right there.
16376920	16378920	Don't come any closer if you please.
16378920	16381920	You're much, much too cold for us, you see.
16381920	16383920	You could freeze a stiff, you know.
16385920	16389920	Oh, is it possible that you get lonely all by yourself?
16391920	16394920	I don't think there's anything we can do to help you know,
16394920	16398920	not without fur coats and earmuffs and worn gloves anyway.
16398920	16399920	We must go.
16415920	16417920	Someone's been stealing our firewood.
16417920	16419920	I wonder what they're doing with it.
16419920	16422920	Something bad, there's no doubt about that.
16422920	16425920	Must've been several people did this.
16426920	16428920	We had a lot of fun here in the summer.
16428920	16429920	Remember?
16429920	16432920	Well, the she is still here round the ice.
16432920	16433920	I hope.
16433920	16436920	Too, Tiki! Too, Tiki!
16455920	16456920	There's no one here.
16456920	16457920	Are you sure?
16457920	16458920	Look for yourself.
16461920	16464920	I know they're invisible, but I'm a shroom ice in here.
16464920	16467920	Hard to tell, with things you can't see.
16468920	16470920	Oh, what is it?
16470920	16473920	It felt like something scampering on my back.
16473920	16476920	That's all right, it must be one of the shroom ice.
16480920	16482920	Moomin, Moomin.
16483920	16486920	Oh, where could he have gone?
16488920	16492920	My goodness, I've never seen anything quite like this before.
16492920	16494920	Hi, it's good to see you.
16494920	16496920	You're right, she's fishing.
16496920	16497920	Hi, too, Tiki!
16497920	16499920	Hello, too, Tiki!
16499920	16502920	So this winter's not made in woke up too, huh?
16502920	16504920	I walk her up by mistake.
16504920	16507920	You know that spring is still a long way off, don't you?
16507920	16510920	I thought it might be seeing there's no sun at all.
16510920	16513920	But the sun is gonna come back tomorrow, Moomin.
16513920	16514920	Tomorrow?
16514920	16517920	It's Northmaiden was so worried about the sun not showing.
16517920	16521920	The sun will rise tomorrow, Moomin, but it'll go down very soon.
16521920	16525920	Too, Tiki, you know, I think there must be records in Moomin Valley.
16525920	16527920	Records in winter?
16527920	16530920	There's an enormous pile of firewood up on the hillside.
16530920	16534920	Oh, I know, it took a long time to collect that wood.
16534920	16536920	But some of it belongs to us.
16536920	16539920	Hmm, that doesn't really surprise me, though, Moomin.
16539920	16543920	I'm afraid the winter creatures aren't very careful about ownership.
16543920	16546920	They need a lot, so if they see it, they take it.
16546920	16548920	It's for their big winter bonfire.
16548920	16549920	A bonfire?
16549920	16553920	Yes, and now your firewood can take part in the big celebration.
16553920	16557920	They light it every winter to make sure the sun comes back, you know.
16557920	16561920	Oh, you mean otherwise the sun wouldn't come back, Tiki?
16561920	16566920	Well, since they always light it on this day, you don't really know, do you?
16566920	16568920	Tonight you might see the winter creatures.
16568920	16571920	Okay, we come along as well, Tiki.
16571920	16572920	Yes, you can.
16572920	16575920	If you sit quietly and don't scare them in any way.
16575920	16577920	Wonderful. You're coming along, too, aren't you?
16577920	16579920	It, of course.
16579920	16581920	Stop! Help me!
16581920	16583920	Someone shouting for help?
16583920	16584920	Who could it be?
16584920	16587920	Go away! Get away from me!
16587920	16590920	I didn't do it on purpose! I didn't mean any harm!
16590920	16594920	If you don't leave me alone, Grandma will turn you into a toad!
16594920	16597920	Oh, that's so cold! Go away, please!
16597920	16601920	Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
16605920	16607920	Grow! Leave her alone!
16607920	16609920	What are you doing, Grog?
16612920	16613920	Move, man!
16613920	16614920	Alicia!
16614920	16617920	Now listen, Grog, why can't you be nice to her?
16617920	16618920	Alicia is one of my friends.
16618920	16622920	She was just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis.
16622920	16625920	I nearly bumped into her, but I didn't touch her.
16625920	16626920	That's all right, Alicia.
16626920	16628920	Tell me, Grog, what's gotten into you?
16628920	16630920	Why are you so nasty to such a sweet little girl?
16630920	16632920	It isn't like you at all.
16632920	16638920	I must have startled her, I guess, and I didn't apologize at all, but it made no difference.
16638920	16640920	This is really, very odd.
16640920	16644920	Then I asked if she had seen you, and that's when she started to get mad at me.
16644920	16646920	And she doesn't even know me.
16646920	16647920	It's a mystery.
16647920	16650920	Whatever's the matter with you, Grog.
16650920	16652920	Whoa!
16664920	16666920	Oh, I was so scared.
16666920	16668920	I'm so glad you've come to see us.
16668920	16670920	So am I, women.
16670920	16673920	Somehow I felt certain you hadn't gone into hibernation yet.
16673920	16676920	But what did your grandmother say?
16676920	16679920	Nothing because I didn't tell her I was coming.
16679920	16681920	Thank you for chasing off that terrible monster.
16681920	16684920	The Grog hasn't actually ever attacked anyone.
16684920	16687920	Well, maybe she doesn't like the look of Alicia.
16687920	16689920	Snork maiden.
16689920	16692920	It's really a mystery to me why the Grog was here at all.
16692920	16695920	She was here looking for a moment no doubt.
16695920	16696920	Was she?
16696920	16699920	He suddenly become very popular.
16699920	16700920	Huh?
16700920	16702920	You don't mean...
16702920	16708920	What's the matter with you?
16708920	16711920	I think the Grog may have fallen in love with you, woman.
16711920	16712920	What?
16712920	16714920	Oh, you can't mean that.
16714920	16716920	Please tell me you're not serious.
16716920	16718920	It's out of the question.
16718920	16719920	It's her ridiculous idea.
16719920	16721920	Don't be so silly.
16721920	16741920	Where is all that drumming noise coming from?
16741920	16751640	Where's all that drumming noise coming from?
16751640	16754440	From the invisible shroom ice.
16754440	16756480	How long before everybody arrives?
16756480	16759480	Oh, they're here already, Moomin, all around us.
16759480	16760480	They are?
16760480	16761480	Where?
16761480	16762480	I can't see them.
16762480	16764720	Are they really invisible?
16764720	16769680	I can't see them either, but I can feel their presence all around me.
16770080	16773400	But she's been studying witchcraft, hasn't she?
16773400	16778400	I'm sure you and Moomin will be able to feel their presence quite soon.
16800680	16801680	Oh!
16821680	16825680	I can see some of them looking all over there.
16830680	16831680	Oh!
16835680	16838680	I can't see them, too, you guys.
16843680	16846680	Dootie, can you tell me why can't we see all of them?
16846680	16848680	Well, we can never see them all.
16848680	16852680	I don't understand how did you know earlier on the shroom ice were playing the drums.
16852680	16856680	I just know because they sometimes play them in the batch house as well.
16856680	16858680	What a wonderful celebration.
16858680	16863680	Isn't it lucky I came over here if I had not had missed a most memorable evening?
16878680	16880680	What's going on here?
16880680	16882680	The grog.
16882680	16883680	What?
16884680	16888680	What's she going on here?
16888680	16892680	She must be looking for Moomin again, I guess.
16892680	16895680	No, I think she just wants to warm herself by the fire.
16896680	16899680	But what's she doing?
16920680	16924680	Well, that's the end of the midwinter bonfire.
16924680	16925680	Pull, grog.
16925680	16927680	She freezes everything she touches.
16927680	16933680	Whatever she sits on, even the hottest bonfire turns freezing cold in a matter of seconds.
16933680	16937680	Well, at least she's managed to save some of our wood.
16945680	16949680	Don't hold on tight now, Snorkemaid, and I'm be careful.
16949680	16952680	I can't wait to get into bed.
16952680	16955680	I wanted to stay up until the sun came up again.
16955680	16958680	But I don't know if I could keep awake till then.
16958680	16961680	So long till spring then, Moomin.
16961680	16963680	Goodbye.
16963680	16965680	And take care, Alicia.
16965680	16967680	I will, Moomin.
16967680	16970680	The moon will light my way back.
16982680	16985680	This time, the Moomin's have gone too far.
16985680	16986680	Something must be done.
16986680	16989680	I'll teach them a lesson they'll never forget.
16989680	16992680	They won't get the better at me.
16992680	16997680	Now, what does the witch mean by teach them a lesson?
16997680	17000680	That sounds very ominous.
17000680	17004680	Let's hope at least that she lets them sleep till next spring.
17012680	17015680	Moomin.
17042680	17045680	Moomin.
17045680	17048680	Moomin.
17048680	17051680	Moomin.
17051680	17054680	Moomin.
17072680	17075680	Moomin.
17075680	17078680	Here they are for one and all.
17078680	17081680	The Moomin's are about to call.
17081680	17084680	Come on and sit down here with me.
17084680	17086680	Therefore you are your TV.
17086680	17089680	They are the Moomin's.
17089680	17092680	They are the Moomin's.
17092680	17095680	So come with me, give me your hand.
17095680	17098680	I'll take you up to Moomin land.
17098680	17101680	You can fly just like a bird.
17101680	17104680	Sing that song ever.
17104680	17106680	There were the Moomin's.
17106680	17112680	There were the Moomin's.
17112680	17115680	There were the Moomin's.
17115680	17118680	There were the Moomin's.
17118680	17122680	There were the Moomin's.
17131680	17161680	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
17161680	17191680	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
17191680	17196080	But right now.
17196080	17198580	The witch has come to Moomin Valley.
17198580	17201080	What could she be up to this time?
17201080	17204160	Eldregrapala Zoom! Eldregrapala Zoom!
17204160	17206880	Eldregrapala Zoom! Eldregrapala Zoom!
17206880	17212720	Eldregrapala Zoom! Jazzy Shrimp!
17212720	17217460	Eldregrapala Zoom! Eldregrapala Zoom!
17217460	17219460	He'll just come out as old!
17222020	17225260	Always snowing again. I must get a covered brown.
17247460	17256460	The great thaw had come at last.
17262460	17264460	The Moomin Valley.
17269460	17271460	I think I can smell spring!
17272460	17276460	Oh, I've never seen anything like this one before.
17284460	17286460	Hello there, Mr. Hemielun.
17286460	17289460	Hello, Sniff. You're up early this year?
17289460	17292460	Yes. I think I've even beat Moomin to it.
17292460	17296460	Is that so? Why are the Moomin so late this year?
17302460	17307460	Moomin, wake up! Spring is here! It's time to wake up!
17307460	17308460	Moomin!
17309460	17312460	Maybe Snork Maiden's easier to wake up.
17312460	17314460	Snork Maiden!
17315460	17319460	And I thought I was difficult to wake up. I must get closer.
17319460	17320460	Yes.
17329460	17331460	What are you doing, Sniff?
17331460	17333460	What am I doing? You can see, can't you?
17333460	17335460	Of course I can, but why are you climbing up that?
17335460	17338460	Moomin and Snork Maiden are still asleep. I have to wake them up.
17338460	17342460	Why don't you go this way? It's easier!
17343460	17345460	What are you doing?
17351460	17354460	Funny, even Moomin Mama's still asleep.
17359460	17361460	Wrong room.
17363460	17366460	Come on! Wake up, lazy bones!
17367460	17369460	Moomin, spring has come!
17377460	17380460	We'll look at that! Wake up, you sleepyhead!
17380460	17383460	Oh, you really are impossible!
17383460	17387460	Moomin, Moomin, Moomin! This is odd, even for Moomin!
17390460	17392460	Open the window, little mind!
17397460	17401460	Oh, was I scared?
17402460	17405460	Oh, I haven't you opened them up!
17405460	17407460	I've tried, but they won't!
17408460	17410460	You're kidding!
17412460	17414460	No one can resist this little mind!
17415460	17418460	Wake up, Moomin! I know you're ticklish!
17421460	17423460	Moomin, Moomin!
17423460	17425460	I told you so!
17427460	17431460	Moomin, come on!
17442460	17444460	How strange!
17444460	17446460	How sad!
17446460	17447460	What do you mean?
17447460	17449460	I think...
17451460	17454460	It's hard to tell. I was listening for a heartbeat.
17456460	17458460	He's still breathing.
17459460	17461460	And Snork made it?
17462460	17465460	Wake up, you slug of it!
17465460	17467460	Snork made it!
17468460	17470460	They won't wake up!
17470460	17471460	This is strange!
17471460	17473460	Why don't we go and try the other?
17473460	17474460	Yes, why not?
17474460	17477460	I hate it when others are asleep while I'm up.
17477460	17481460	But then I don't like it much the other way around either, do I, Snip?
17482460	17484460	Moomin, pop up, please wake up!
17484460	17486460	We've tried to wake up, Moomin, but he won't!
17486460	17488460	Wakey, Moomin!
17488460	17490460	Mama breakfast time!
17490460	17492460	Come on, Moomin, pop up!
17492460	17494460	Wake up!
17494460	17496460	This is no use!
17504460	17507460	Goodness, it seems the Moomin's are still hibernating.
17507460	17509460	And so is Snork Maiden.
17509460	17512460	That's odd. She always wakes up even before me.
17512460	17516460	Oh, Moomin, too, but this year it seems to be different.
17516460	17519460	I'll go back home, and I'll come over again in a little while
17519460	17521460	when the Moomin family will have woken up.
17521460	17523460	If they ever do.
17523460	17524460	Huh?
17524460	17526460	We've tried everything to wake them up,
17526460	17528460	short of buckets of water, and there's no moving them.
17528460	17532460	We've shouted and shook and pinched and tickled and stopped!
17532460	17533460	Oh, dear!
17533460	17535460	It's not just strange, it's ominous.
17535460	17537460	Oh, my, surely not.
17538460	17540460	Hello, everybody.
17540460	17542460	How is everyone?
17542460	17543460	What is it?
17543460	17546460	You all look very scared.
17546460	17548460	Huh?
17548460	17551460	Still hibernating?
17554460	17557460	It's all very strange, habulin.
17558460	17560460	Moomin!
17560460	17561460	See?
17561460	17563460	Yes, indeed.
17564460	17568460	How we can really do is wait and see.
17568460	17570460	I suppose you're right.
17570460	17573460	Don't worry, the days are getting longer all the time now,
17573460	17575460	so the Moomin's can't sleep much longer.
17575460	17577460	And Snork Maiden?
17577460	17580460	Cheat too, of course.
17580460	17583460	Bet you anything Moomin wakes up when Snuffkin returns.
17583460	17585460	I think you're right, Sniff.
17585460	17589460	And then, one day about a week later,
17589460	17594460	Snuffkin did come back from his yearly trip south.
17595460	17597460	Snuffkin!
17617460	17619460	Snuffkin!
17625460	17627460	Snuffkin!
17630460	17632460	Snuffkin!
17632460	17634460	Snuffkin!
17655460	17657460	Where's Moomin?
17657460	17659460	He's in bed.
17659460	17661460	Moomin's still asleep.
17661460	17663460	A sleep.
17671460	17674460	They won't wake up no matter what you do.
17674460	17677460	What do you think, Snuffkin?
17677460	17679460	I think they're very sick.
17679460	17681460	That's a possibility.
17681460	17683460	Sleeping sickness, perhaps?
17683460	17685460	It's very difficult to say.
17685460	17687460	To me, though, if you want my honest opinion,
17687460	17690460	I think somebody has cast a very nasty spell on them.
17690460	17692460	A spell?
17692460	17694460	But who would do that?
17694460	17696460	I think I know.
17696460	17697460	Huh?
17697460	17698460	You mean the witch?
17698460	17700460	Alice is grandmother, but why?
17700460	17703460	To tell you the truth, I haven't the biggest idea.
17703460	17706460	How do we find out?
17706460	17709460	I'll go to the forest and see her.
17709460	17712460	And if she did cast a spell, do you think she'd tell you?
17712460	17715460	I really don't know, but we have to do something.
17715460	17718460	We can't just leave them sleeping here forever.
17718460	17720460	I'll go with you.
17720460	17723460	I guess I'd better stay here to take care of things.
17723460	17727460	Well, if they suddenly wake up, somebody needs to be here.
17727460	17729460	Snuffkin.
17729460	17730460	Huh?
17730460	17731460	That's him!
17731460	17732460	At last!
17732460	17733460	Moomin!
17733460	17734460	Moomin!
17734460	17735460	Moomin!
17737460	17739460	He's dreaming.
17739460	17742460	It makes me feel sleepy.
17743460	17748460	Moomin, I promise to get this horrible spell cast off for you.
17770460	17772460	Hush.
17783460	17785460	Where are you going?
17785460	17789460	I've done all the chores, even washed out your old potion jars.
17789460	17791460	So where are you going?
17791460	17792460	Spring is here, Grandma.
17792460	17795460	I thought I'd take some time off to celebrate.
17795460	17797460	But what about your work?
17797460	17800460	I'm just going out for the day, Grandma.
17800460	17802460	And I know where.
17802460	17804460	I only want to see the Moomin's.
17804460	17805460	They're still hibernating.
17805460	17806460	No, they're not.
17806460	17808460	It isn't winter anymore.
17808460	17812460	Winter or spring, I happen to know the Moomin's are still asleep.
17812460	17815460	How could you know what the Moomin's are up to, Grandma?
17815460	17816460	Hm.
17816460	17818460	Oh, which is no everything, my dear girl.
17818460	17819460	Really?
17819460	17821460	Well, I'll go and see.
17821460	17823460	Come here.
17828460	17833460	I have to admit that I can't help being worried about the Moomin's.
17833460	17836460	Their windows are open for the spring.
17836460	17839460	So they can smell the first spring flowers?
17839460	17843460	Well, I suppose I'd miss beginning on.
17847460	17850460	Why didn't you tell them about the witch in the spell?
17850460	17853460	Well, after all, that was just an idea I got.
17853460	17856460	Ideas can be embarrassing if you were wrong.
17856460	17859460	So don't tell anyone for the time being.
17859460	17860460	All right.
17860460	17861460	I'm going.
17863460	17865460	And I'm leaving, too.
17865460	17866460	Okay.
17871460	17873460	There's Alicia.
17873460	17875460	Hi, everyone.
17875460	17876460	It's me.
17876460	17878460	Why do you get a teller?
17878460	17881460	We better tell of the truth, I guess.
17887460	17890460	The best thing would be for me to talk to her first.
17890460	17891460	Yes, I agree.
17891460	17893460	She's unbelievable.
17893460	17894460	How could she?
17897460	17900460	I can hardly believe you could be so mean, Grandma.
17900460	17902460	Calm down, my dear.
17902460	17905460	Why did it all for you, Alicia?
17905460	17907460	You did it for me.
17907460	17909460	If the Moomin's are asleep, why should you go there?
17909460	17912460	Do them a world of good, too, along sleep.
17912460	17914460	How ridiculous, Grandma, there.
17914460	17917460	Alicia, you've done quite well in your studies, and if you keep at it,
17917460	17922460	I see no reason why you shouldn't be a fully fledged witch before a 30.
17923460	17926460	And if I do see the Moomin's, I won't be a witch till I'm 31.
17926460	17927460	Is that what you mean?
17927460	17930460	Now, the Moomin's are very bad influence on you.
17930460	17935460	They are so disgustingly good, and if you want to be a witch, you mustn't see them.
17939460	17942460	And if I promise never to go near Moomin Valley again,
17942460	17944460	will you lift the spell, Grandma?
17944460	17947460	Good girl, that's exactly what I wanted here.
17947460	17949460	You promise me, Dan, Alicia?
17949460	17950460	I promise, Grandma.
17950460	17952460	Right, the spell should be lifted.
17952460	17953460	Snuff head.
17953460	17954460	What do you want?
17954460	17957460	There are two different ways of lifting the spell I cast on the Moomin's.
17957460	17958460	Uh-huh.
17958460	17962460	The first one is that I go to Moomin Valley myself and chant the magic words
17962460	17964460	outside their bedroom window.
17964460	17966460	Oh, Grandma, that's not a good idea.
17966460	17971460	Oh, oh, you mean people who might be upset about me casting a spell on the Moomin's?
17971460	17973460	You may be right.
17973460	17977460	So therefore, Snuff Kid, I have no choice but to ask you to perform the task.
17977460	17978460	Oh.
17978460	17979460	But why me?
17979460	17981460	You do have your harmonica with you?
17981460	17982460	Of course.
17982460	17984460	Let me have it, please.
17988460	17989460	Eldish Cabalasome.
17989460	17990460	Eldish Cabalasome.
17990460	17991460	Eldish Cabalasome.
17991460	17992460	Eldish Cabalasome.
17992460	17993460	Eldish Cabalasome.
17993460	17998460	If you don't stop staring at me, my witchcraft won't be effective.
17999460	18001460	Alicia, get me the next potion now.
18001460	18002460	Oh.
18003460	18004460	Oh.
18004460	18006460	All right, grandmother.
18010460	18011460	Eldish Cabalasome.
18011460	18012460	Eldish Cabalasome.
18012460	18013460	Eldish Cabalasome.
18013460	18014460	Eldish Cabalasome.
18014460	18016460	Oh, she can't do it if we look at her, huh?
18016460	18017460	Eldish Cabalasome.
18017460	18018460	Eldish Cabalasome.
18018460	18020460	Now, listen, Inspector.
18020460	18021460	You must do something.
18021460	18023460	You are the police, aren't you?
18023460	18027460	Well, I have to tell you, waking people up is not really part of our job.
18027460	18029460	But you're our last hope, Inspector.
18029460	18031460	You must do something.
18031460	18034460	Perhaps if you could possibly use your whistle to wake them up.
18034460	18035460	Uh-huh.
18035460	18037460	It's very shrill indoors. Good Friday.
18037460	18039460	And fire your revolver.
18039460	18041460	I'm sure that would do it, Inspector.
18041460	18044460	I don't carry guns. They're dangerous.
18044460	18046460	Oh, dear.
18051460	18052460	Hey!
18052460	18053460	Snuffkin!
18053460	18055460	Little Y!
18055460	18058460	He sounds worried. I bet they're still fast asleep.
18058460	18059460	Hmm.
18063460	18064460	Right, Snuffkin?
18064460	18065460	Get on with it.
18066460	18067460	Hmm.
18067460	18069460	Hmm.
18077460	18078460	Hmm.
18078460	18080460	Hmm.
18080460	18082460	Hmm.
18082460	18083460	Hmm.
18083460	18084460	Hmm.
18084460	18085460	It's not working. Is it?
18085460	18087460	Get my chance, Snuffkin.
18087460	18088460	Hmm.
18088460	18090460	Hmm.
18090460	18093460	Hmm.
18093460	18094460	Hmm.
18094460	18104460	Snorke! Snorke, Maiden! Wake up! Spring is here! Come on!
18114460	18116460	Spring is here already!
18116460	18118460	Good morning, Papa, dear!
18118460	18120460	Good morning!
18120460	18124460	I have a feeling we've over slept. I wonder whether the others are up yet.
18124460	18128460	Oh, she's made a fool of you, Snorke!
18128460	18132460	Oh, shut up, Snorke! Maybe she forgot how to cast off the spell!
18132460	18134460	Hi, Snorke! Hi!
18134460	18136460	Good morning!
18138460	18140460	Good morning, everybody!
18140460	18142460	Hi, Snorke!
18144460	18148460	I'm so glad you were right back already, Snorke!
18148460	18152460	You woke up early, too! Did you hear that?
18152460	18154460	It's you that woke up late, women!
18154460	18156460	Who me?
18160460	18162460	Hmm? Ah!
18162460	18166460	Now I say, women's all ready up and about!
18166460	18168460	What?
18168460	18170460	Oh, hi, Snorke!
18170460	18172460	Oh, it's you, you're awake!
18172460	18174460	I'm glad I didn't blow my whistle!
18174460	18176460	But we did have a reason to be worried, Inspector!
18176460	18178460	He's right! What about Mom and Mama?
18178460	18180460	And Mom and Papa?
18180460	18182460	Hello there, everybody!
18182460	18184460	Is anything the matter?
18184460	18186460	Nothing at all!
18186460	18188460	They're awake! Oh, dear! I don't understand!
18188460	18190460	You don't understand what?
18190460	18194460	We were very worried because you just wouldn't wake up!
18194460	18196460	Oh, really? You do know we always have a night, don't you?
18196460	18198460	We sleep all winter, and we always wake up in the spring!
18198460	18202460	Of course, of course, but this year, Snorke, you're telling!
18202460	18204460	Well, we did have a bit of a problem!
18204460	18206460	You see, Mom and Papa, we couldn't swim!
18206460	18208460	Snorke!
18208460	18210460	Back already!
18210460	18212460	Why don't you listen to us, Mom and Papa?
18212460	18214460	Very well!
18214460	18216460	Why don't you come in and we'll have a nice cup of tea,
18216460	18218460	and then we can discuss your problem properly!
18218460	18220460	But it's your problem, I'm afraid!
18220460	18222460	Not ours!
18222460	18224460	What does he mean?
18224460	18226460	We don't have a problem, do we?
18226460	18228460	Please do come in anyway, everybody!
18228460	18230460	Please!
18230460	18231460	You too! All of you come in!
18231460	18233460	Come in, everybody!
18235460	18237460	Move aside! I'm in Georgia!
18247460	18249460	Whatever happened was this year!
18249460	18251460	Hey, Snorke!
18255460	18257460	Alicia!
18261460	18263460	Mom!
18263460	18265460	We've come to see you, Alicia!
18265460	18267460	That was nice of you!
18269460	18271460	Your grandmother isn't home, is she?
18271460	18273460	No! Then we can play hide and seek!
18273460	18275460	I can't!
18275460	18277460	I promised Grandma there!
18277460	18279460	Yes, I know, Snorke can tell me!
18279460	18281460	That was a really great thing to do!
18281460	18283460	But you didn't promise not to see us!
18283460	18285460	You just promised not to go to Mom and Valley, didn't you?
18285460	18287460	Yeah!
18287460	18289460	And listen, you never promised not to play with us either, did you?
18289460	18291460	No!
18291460	18293460	So, if we came here to see you instead of you to us,
18293460	18295460	then it's alright!
18295460	18297460	And you don't have to break your promise!
18297460	18299460	Oh! I suppose so!
18299460	18301460	Yes, I suppose you're right!
18301460	18303460	Well, let's play!
18303460	18305460	Yeah!
18305460	18311460	13, 4, 7, 5, 8!
18311460	18313460	Oh!
18325460	18329460	That afternoon, they all had the most wonderful time playing hide and seek in the woods!
18329460	18331460	Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
18331460	18335460	I'm Jule!
18335460	18337460	Three!
18337460	18339460	Your titties are!
18339460	18341460	Five!
18341460	18343460	Six!
18343460	18345460	Seven!
18345460	18347460	Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
18347460	18349460	Nine!
18349460	18351460	Ten!
18351460	18353460	Eleven!
18357460	18363460	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements!
18363460	18371460	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements!
18371460	18375460	They're always happy and goes at play!
18375460	18379460	The Moons are having fun day after day!
18379460	18381460	The Moons!
18381460	18385460	The Moons!
18385460	18389460	The Moons!
18389460	18393460	The Moons!
18393460	18395460	The Moons!
18395460	18399460	The Moons!
18399460	18401460	The Moons!
18401460	18405460	The Moons!
18405460	18409460	The Moons!
18409460	18413460	The Moons!
18413460	18417460	Here they are for one and all!
18417460	18421460	The Moons are about to call!
18421460	18423460	Come on and sit down here with me!
18423460	18425460	They're here for you on your TV!
18425460	18429460	They are the movements!
18429460	18431460	They are the movements!
18431460	18433460	So come with me!
18433460	18435460	Give me your hand!
18435460	18437460	I'll take you up to a moment land!
18437460	18441460	You can fly just like a bird!
18441460	18443460	Sing that song ever!
18443460	18445460	There were the movements!
18445460	18451460	There were the movements!
18451460	18455460	There were the movement!
18455460	18457460	There were the movements!
18457460	18461460	There were the movements!
18475460	18483460	Big explosions could be heard in Mumen Valley almost every night and Mumen couldn't sleep a wink.
18483460	18487460	Usually there was just one, but sometimes even two.
18491460	18493460	You heard it too, Mumen, papa.
18493460	18496460	Yes, those loud bangs are keeping me awake.
18496460	18498460	I wonder if there'll be another one.
18501460	18503460	They seem to be coming from the north.
18503460	18505460	Hmm, he's tired, though.
18505460	18507460	Or they could be coming from lonely mountains.
18507460	18511460	If you ask me, I believe they're the work of the witch.
18511460	18514460	The witch? But witches don't make a lot of noise.
18514460	18517460	Never know. They're sneaky characters.
18517460	18520460	Tomorrow I'll have a few words with the inspector.
18520460	18522460	It's up to him to put a stop to it.
18522460	18525460	Papa, why would the witch want to make explosions?
18525460	18526460	Why not?
18526460	18530460	The first bang wakes me up and then I lie awake waiting for the second one,
18530460	18532460	which might not come at all.
18532460	18535460	The bangs might not come from Mumen Valley at all,
18535460	18537460	and they might be just an echo off the mountains.
18537460	18538460	You think so?
18538460	18539460	Yes, I do.
18539460	18541460	Well, at least that's what Snuffkin thinks.
18541460	18543460	I mean, the explosions might come from the sea.
18543460	18545460	That's what Snuffkin figured.
18545460	18548460	He thought it might be pirates or something making the noises.
18548460	18551460	He's already had pirates and they went a long time ago.
18551460	18553460	I'm plumping for the witch.
18553460	18554460	There's no doubt in my mind.
18554460	18556460	Goodness, what are you doing out here?
18556460	18558460	We're waiting for another explosion, Mama.
18558460	18560460	You'll wait in vain, dear.
18560460	18562460	Who do you know that moment, Mama?
18562460	18564460	Well, we had two explosions last night,
18564460	18568460	and we've never had double explosions for two nights in a row.
18569460	18571460	Until now, that is.
18571460	18572460	You heard that.
18572460	18574460	It clearly came from over there.
18574460	18575460	Over there?
18575460	18577460	Oh, no. It certainly came from over there.
18577460	18579460	You couldn't mistake it.
18579460	18581460	I'm sure of it.
18591460	18593460	Good morning, Moomin, lovely day.
18593460	18594460	Morning, Snuffkin.
18594460	18595460	You look very sleepy.
18595460	18597460	So would you be a close explosion
18597460	18599460	that kept you awake for most of the night?
18599460	18602460	Those explosions are really very hard, aren't they?
18602460	18603460	They certainly are.
18603460	18606460	Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?
18606460	18609460	Moomin, Puppers, convinced that she's the one
18609460	18610460	who's making the bangs.
18610460	18611460	I think he's wrong there.
18611460	18612460	That's what I thought.
18612460	18615460	But there's nothing I could say to convince him.
18615460	18618460	So now I'm going to find out what he's doing.
18618460	18621460	So now I'm going to find out for myself.
18621460	18622460	You can certainly ask her,
18622460	18625460	but do you really trust a witch to tell you the truth?
18627460	18628460	Do you, Moomin?
18628460	18631460	But witches don't have to lie, Shirley.
18639460	18641460	Is that you, Little My?
18643460	18645460	And where are you two going?
18645460	18646460	Little My.
18646460	18648460	Are you tailing me full-time or what?
18648460	18651460	Yes, whenever you're sneaking off somewhere,
18651460	18653460	I'm not sneaking. I'm just walking.
18653460	18657460	Well, I've never seen anyone walking in such a sneaky way.
18661460	18665460	Last time the witch tried to keep you from waking up, didn't she?
18665460	18666460	So...
18666460	18669460	So you think now she's trying to keep you from sleeping?
18669460	18671460	Well, if she makes the explosions,
18671460	18674460	it's always possible that someone else is the target.
18674460	18676460	We know very little about witches,
18676460	18679460	and those bangs are probably nothing to do with the Moomons.
18680460	18682460	I think you guessed right,
18682460	18684460	but try telling that to the Moomons.
18684460	18686460	We don't think it's like that at all.
18692460	18694460	Wonder if she's at home.
18694460	18696460	If she isn't, we can visit Alicia instead.
18696460	18698460	Better ask Alicia than the witch.
18698460	18700460	Anyway, she's more likely to tell us the truth.
18700460	18702460	Yes, you're right.
18705460	18707460	Oh, oh, oh.
18710460	18713460	Look, you don't seem to realize this is a witch's house.
18713460	18715460	What do you mean by that?
18715460	18717460	I'll tell you what I mean.
18717460	18721460	What I mean is I don't want to be seen talking with goody-goodies like the Moomons.
18721460	18723460	You think they'll ruin your reputation,
18723460	18725460	is that why you're so worried?
18728460	18731460	There's just something very important we wanted to ask you.
18732460	18734460	And then we'll leave straight away.
18740460	18743460	That room upstairs, is that Alicia's?
18743460	18744460	It is.
18744460	18746460	Is Alicia there now?
18746460	18747460	No, she isn't.
18747460	18748460	Where did she go?
18748460	18750460	She went to get some wolf's vein.
18750460	18751460	When will she be coming back?
18751460	18753460	You're not going to stop her studying.
18754460	18755460	No.
18755460	18759460	We wanted to ask her something about that loud noise we hear every night.
18760460	18761460	Ah, that one.
18761460	18764460	Hey, are you the one making the bangs?
18764460	18766460	I don't make explosions.
18766460	18767460	Who is it then?
18767460	18769460	I really don't know.
18769460	18771460	But why did you say that one then?
18771460	18773460	Because the explosions bother me, too.
18774460	18776460	You think they're coming from near here?
18776460	18779460	I think they're coming from far away from the sea, maybe.
18779460	18781460	That's what snuffkin' things, too.
18781460	18784460	Any sound from the sea echoes off Lonely Mountain,
18784460	18786460	so you think that's where it comes from?
18786460	18788460	Why is young man a few days ago?
18788460	18791460	I went all the way over to the beach to see what was happening.
18791460	18794460	After a whole day's witching and casting magic spells,
18794460	18796460	one needs one sleep, you know.
18796460	18798460	So, what did you find them?
18798460	18799460	Nothing at all.
18799460	18801460	There was only one explosion that night,
18801460	18804460	so when I got there on my brunt, there was nothing more to see.
18804460	18807460	Then we still have no idea who makes the bangs.
18807460	18810460	No, and I really upset you thought it was me.
18810460	18812460	When a witch creates an explosion,
18812460	18814460	it doesn't sound anything like a camel cough.
18814460	18816460	I can tell you.
18816460	18818460	Camel cough, I like that.
18818460	18820460	Camel cough, I like that.
18834460	18836460	Thank you very much, Snort Maiden.
18838460	18841460	This year I want to grow some black tulips.
18841460	18844460	Is there really such a thing as a black tulip?
18844460	18846460	There's such a dark red, they look black.
18846460	18847460	Oh, I see.
18847460	18850460	Although it wouldn't really surprise me, Snort Maiden,
18850460	18852460	if there really were black ones somewhere.
18852460	18854460	We must ask the hamulineal now.
18854460	18856460	Oh, yes.
18856460	18859460	I know it's embarrassing, but I'm so excited.
18859460	18861460	I can't go to sleep at night.
18861460	18863460	Oh, I have no problem going to sleep at night,
18863460	18865460	but that noise wakes me up, Pamuline.
18865460	18866460	What noise is that?
18866460	18868460	I told you that noise.
18869460	18870460	Oh, I see.
18870460	18872460	You're talking about the explosion.
18872460	18874460	You know anything about it, Mr. Hamuline?
18874460	18876460	No, nothing at all.
18876460	18879460	No, those bangs are not what keeps me awake,
18879460	18881460	moment papa.
18881460	18884460	No, I'm waiting for a pie from the botanist federation.
18884460	18885460	Reply?
18885460	18888460	Yes, don't you remember a few months ago?
18888460	18891460	Pouse range, I thought I told you about it.
18891460	18893460	Well, I certainly told everyone else I know.
18893460	18896460	I sent them a brand new species.
18897460	18898460	New species?
18898460	18901460	I'd never seen anything like it in my whole life.
18901460	18905460	A new wild orchid, I'm so excited I can hardly speak.
18905460	18906460	Really?
18906460	18909460	A new wild orchid, how very interesting.
18909460	18910460	Yes, isn't it?
18910460	18913460	Oh, it would be such a great honor for me and for everyone else
18913460	18916460	if they called it Orkydaka-Hemulensis or Himila Formis.
18916460	18918460	No, I'm sure they will.
18918460	18922460	So now you understand why I've had so many sleepless nights.
18922460	18924460	Yes, indeed.
18924460	18926460	The trouble is they should have answered by now.
18926460	18929460	Maybe they're still trying to decide what to call it.
18929460	18932460	Maybe they can't decide between Orkydaka-Hemulensis
18932460	18935460	and Orkydaka-Hemila Formis.
18935460	18936460	Hmm.
18936460	18937460	Oh.
18937460	18939460	What is it?
18939460	18942460	Now I see, at last I understand.
18942460	18945460	I am getting no reply from the botanist federation
18945460	18948460	because it is not a new species.
18948460	18952460	Of course, somebody's already found it.
18952460	18953460	Oh.
18953460	18955460	This is really funny.
18955460	18959460	I'm stupid of him.
18959460	18963460	This is the end of me as a scientist, of course.
18963460	18966460	Calm down, don't upset yourself, Mr. Himulens.
18966460	18970460	Everybody will laugh at me and call me Mr. Himulensis.
18970460	18974460	Now listen, Mr. Himulens, the reply is a long time coming
18974460	18977460	because they must examine your plant most carefully
18977460	18979460	before making a decision.
18979460	18983460	You must read all the books first to be sure.
18983460	18987460	You really think so, Mum and Batman?
18987460	18989460	Could it really take so long, do you think?
18989460	18991460	Of course, these things take time.
18991460	18993460	When did you send it off?
18993460	18994460	A month ago.
18994460	18997460	Oh, there you are, that's no time at all.
18997460	18999460	You have to learn to be patient, Emulensis.
18999460	19000460	You think so?
19000460	19002460	Oh, I feel better already.
19002460	19004460	Oh, I'm so glad you feel happier, Mr. Himulens.
19004460	19006460	Don't you worry, my friend.
19006460	19008460	Mama, great news dear.
19008460	19011460	Mr. Himulens discovered a completely new plant
19011460	19013460	and is going to be called Himulensis.
19013460	19016460	Oh, that's wonderful.
19016460	19018460	Congratulations, Mr. Himulens.
19018460	19020460	Oh, well, it isn't official yet.
19020460	19023460	No, they're just thinking about the name still.
19023460	19024460	Give them time.
19024460	19026460	We should have a party for Mr. Himulens.
19026460	19027460	Shouldn't we, Papa?
19027460	19028460	What?
19028460	19030460	Oh, yes, indeed.
19030460	19032460	When, Papa, tonight?
19033460	19035460	Hmm, let me think.
19035460	19038460	We should wait just a little bit longer perhaps.
19038460	19040460	Oh, why do you say that?
19040460	19041460	Mr. Himulens.
19041460	19043460	You know that rare plant you found?
19043460	19045460	Does it have any flowers?
19045460	19046460	But, of course.
19046460	19047460	Are they pretty?
19047460	19049460	Very pretty.
19049460	19052460	Yes, just like you, Snork Maiden.
19052460	19054460	Oh, Mr. Himulens.
19054460	19059460	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
19060460	19062460	Hey, look, Snork Maiden.
19062460	19065460	Why don't we go and find out about those explosions tonight, huh?
19065460	19066460	All right.
19066460	19068460	You'll need me to find the way.
19068460	19070460	You want to come along?
19070460	19071460	You bet.
19071460	19072460	They come late at night.
19072460	19074460	I won't go to sleep, Ben.
19074460	19076460	What do you think, Snork Maiden?
19076460	19077460	I'm not sure.
19077460	19080460	Isn't there anything you can do to change your mind, movement?
19080460	19081460	I don't know.
19081460	19082460	Listen, little Maiden.
19082460	19083460	You have to be careful.
19083460	19084460	This could be dangerous.
19084460	19086460	Obviously, or I wouldn't come.
19086460	19088460	Would I spoil my sleep?
19088460	19090460	Well, stick close to us, then.
19090460	19091460	Yes, do that.
19091460	19093460	I also went down to the beach late last night
19093460	19095460	to try and find out what was happening.
19095460	19097460	And while I was there, I saw the witch flying around
19097460	19099460	on her broomstick.
19099460	19100460	Oh, really?
19100460	19102460	Why didn't you tell me so I could have come along?
19102460	19103460	I could hide better than you.
19103460	19105460	You're so white.
19105460	19106460	See, movement?
19106460	19109460	I'm not big in white like you.
19109460	19111460	Oh, there's someone coming.
19111460	19113460	Who?
19115460	19117460	It's Alicia.
19117460	19119460	Hey, Alicia.
19119460	19121460	Hi, Alicia.
19121460	19123460	Oh, my man.
19123460	19124460	Hello, Alicia.
19124460	19125460	How are you?
19125460	19127460	Have you three come here to play with me?
19127460	19130460	No, I'm afraid we have, but it's good to see you.
19130460	19131460	Yes, Alicia.
19131460	19132460	Yes?
19132460	19135460	Has your grandmother been kind to you since your last visit to us?
19135460	19136460	Very kind.
19136460	19138460	She's been treating me very well.
19138460	19140460	Ever since I stopped coming to see you.
19140460	19141460	Oh, good.
19141460	19143460	But we do miss you, Alicia.
19143460	19144460	Oh, I miss you, too.
19144460	19146460	But I must keep my promise to her.
19146460	19148460	She'd be upset if I broke it.
19148460	19149460	What are these weeds?
19149460	19150460	They're herbs.
19150460	19152460	Herbs are very important for a witch.
19152460	19154460	And frogs, bellies, and lizard's tails.
19154460	19156460	They're important, too, of course.
19156460	19158460	I think that's licorice.
19158460	19159460	That's right.
19159460	19160460	Very clever, Snuffkin.
19160460	19162460	We use that for heartburn and coughs.
19162460	19164460	The taste smells quite nice.
19164460	19167460	And it also stops cows from giving their milk.
19167460	19168460	I see.
19168460	19169460	That's interesting.
19177460	19178460	Oh, it's right.
19191460	19193460	Hello, Mr. Hillman.
19193460	19195460	Splendid days.
19195460	19197460	Hello, Mr. Hillman.
19197460	19199460	Don't you work so hard.
19199460	19202460	Yeah, I guess I do with that.
19203460	19205460	Wait.
19205460	19206460	Stop.
19206460	19208460	What is it, Mr. Hillman?
19208460	19209460	My letter.
19209460	19211460	I just want my letter.
19211460	19212460	There isn't one.
19212460	19213460	But why not?
19213460	19216460	You didn't have any yesterday or the day before.
19216460	19218460	Yeah, I know that.
19218460	19219460	Nobody's written to you.
19219460	19220460	That's why.
19220460	19222460	Well, somebody should have written.
19222460	19225460	Are you quite, quite sure that you've gone through your bag properly?
19225460	19229460	Don't you know I'm expecting an important letter from an important scientist?
19229460	19231460	It must be in your bag.
19231460	19233460	Ah, all right, then.
19233460	19234460	Go ahead.
19234460	19235460	What?
19235460	19238460	Well, you don't seem to trust me to do my job properly, Mr. Hemulin.
19238460	19239460	Go ahead.
19239460	19241460	Have a look for yourself, then.
19241460	19243460	Oh, but of course I trust you.
19243460	19244460	Sorry.
19244460	19245460	No, no.
19245460	19246460	You better have a look.
19246460	19247460	What do you think I do?
19247460	19249460	Steam them open and read them at night?
19249460	19250460	No.
19250460	19254460	Oh, you seem to have a lot of letters today.
19254460	19258460	Oh, I really think I should ask for a higher salary.
19258460	19260460	I deserve it.
19261460	19262460	Ah!
19262460	19264460	I'm just starving.
19264460	19267460	I might have to go over and visit the moments in a minute.
19273460	19275460	Oh.
19275460	19277460	I'm sleepy, too.
19277460	19279460	I could go on sleeping.
19279460	19280460	Oh!
19280460	19281460	Oh!
19281460	19283460	What do you think you're doing?
19283460	19285460	Oh, I'm sorry.
19285460	19287460	I didn't see you there.
19287460	19288460	Hmm?
19288460	19290460	There's nothing else out here and you didn't see me?
19290460	19291460	I'm sorry.
19291460	19292460	Oh, dear.
19292460	19294460	What does this matter with you?
19294460	19297460	Is this place called Moomin Valley?
19297460	19298460	Yes.
19298460	19299460	That's right.
19299460	19301460	At last, I found it.
19301460	19303460	I never thought I'd really make it.
19303460	19304460	Excuse me.
19304460	19306460	Are you all right?
19306460	19308460	Doctor me, miss.
19308460	19310460	Oh, tell me what's bothering you.
19310460	19311460	Huh?
19311460	19312460	Oh, she's ill.
19312460	19314460	She's got a fever.
19314460	19316460	Please leave me alone.
19316460	19318460	But you can lie here.
19318460	19320460	You should be in bed, young lady.
19320460	19322460	Do you know a man called Hamilton?
19322460	19323460	Yes.
19323460	19326460	Have you walked all the way to Moomin Valley to visit him?
19326460	19328460	So I have come to the right place.
19328460	19330460	He does live here.
19330460	19331460	Oh, yes.
19331460	19332460	He lives very close to here.
19332460	19336460	I'm so glad I must see him immediately here.
19336460	19338460	Oh, what shall I do?
19338460	19339460	I must do something.
19339460	19340460	Come here, someone.
19340460	19342460	Someone help me.
19342460	19344460	Oh, my goodness.
19344460	19347460	Help!
19347460	19350460	Anyone help!
19350460	19353460	Help me somebody!
19363460	19364460	Papa!
19364460	19365460	Papa!
19365460	19367460	He's up in the guest room if you want him.
19367460	19369460	Mama's there as well.
19369460	19370460	What for?
19370460	19372460	I just rescued a girl, you know.
19372460	19373460	A girl?
19373460	19374460	Did you, Sniff?
19374460	19375460	That's right.
19375460	19376460	Very pretty, too.
19376460	19379460	She's ill and I put her to bed myself.
19379460	19380460	I'm going to see her.
19380460	19381460	Me, too.
19383460	19385460	I want another look as well.
19387460	19389460	First, we must bring her fever down.
19389460	19391460	I think you're right.
19391460	19393460	Yes?
19396460	19398460	Sniff just told us about her.
19398460	19399460	Oh, dear.
19399460	19400460	Is she unconscious?
19400460	19401460	Yes.
19401460	19402460	Where'd she come from?
19402460	19404460	We don't know, little Maya.
19404460	19406460	But Sniff said she'd come here to visit the hemeland.
19406460	19407460	That's right.
19407460	19409460	And Snort Maiden's gone to get him.
19409460	19411460	She's pretty, isn't she?
19411460	19412460	You're right.
19412460	19413460	Very.
19413460	19416460	By the way, Moomin, what did the witch say?
19416460	19417460	Oh, dear.
19417460	19419460	Must I really run like this?
19419460	19420460	Oh!
19420460	19422460	Where is the visitor, young girl?
19422460	19425460	Well, if she's sick, why don't you give her some medicine?
19425460	19427460	I don't know any young girls apart from her.
19427460	19428460	Don't!
19428460	19429460	Just keep running!
19433460	19436460	I told you, I do not know this person.
19436460	19437460	Maybe she's changed.
19437460	19439460	I've already told you.
19439460	19441460	I have never known any young girls.
19441460	19444460	Then why do you think she'd want to come to visit you, hemeland?
19444460	19446460	She's a botanist.
19446460	19449460	And obviously, she's heard of me and wants to come and see
19449460	19451460	the famous hemeland for herself.
19451460	19452460	Oh, dear.
19452460	19454460	She can tell us when she wakes up.
19454460	19457460	We must leave her now so that grandma's medicine can work.
19458460	19460460	I think I'll be getting home.
19460460	19462460	Oh, we couldn't let you go just like that.
19462460	19464460	Please, stay and have some tea with us.
19464460	19466460	Thank you, but no, I have some plans to press.
19466460	19469460	And you're sure you're quite sure you don't know this girl?
19469460	19471460	Absolutely certain.
19471460	19473460	I really must go.
19476460	19478460	I'd forgotten all about you.
19478460	19481460	I'm sure you're sure you're sure you don't know this girl.
19481460	19482460	Absolutely certain.
19482460	19484460	I really must go.
19485460	19487460	I'd forgotten all about the bangs.
19487460	19489460	Well, we haven't snuffed Ken and I.
19489460	19491460	I'm going to look for them tonight.
19491460	19493460	I'd like to come too, but I can't.
19493460	19495460	I'm going with them.
19495460	19497460	Are you snort maiden?
19497460	19499460	You'll be hiding on the beach in the middle of the night?
19499460	19500460	Yes.
19500460	19503460	And then we'll rush off to where the bangs are coming from as soon as we hear them.
19503460	19505460	That's the plan.
19505460	19507460	Oh, I'd really love to come.
19507460	19508460	I'd rather go to bed.
19508460	19511460	I'd be a bit scared of the beach in the middle of the night.
19511460	19514460	After all, it's my duty to stay here with Movement Mama.
19514460	19516460	Are you coming, Sniff?
19516460	19518460	Certainly not.
19518460	19520460	Not me.
19522460	19525460	It just occurred to me that's why she's here.
19525460	19527460	Ah.
19537460	19539460	Here, you better take this movement.
19539460	19541460	You might get very hungry.
19541460	19543460	Oh, thank you, Mama.
19543460	19545460	A midnight snack. I really envy you.
19545460	19548460	Well, Grandpa, why don't you come with us?
19548460	19550460	Oh, there's nothing I'd love more.
19550460	19553460	But I'd better not tonight. Right, Mama?
19553460	19555460	Oh, definitely not.
19555460	19559460	What would I do if something happened to the girl while you were away?
19559460	19560460	Exactly.
19560460	19563460	All right, Papa. We'll find out about the bangs for you.
19563460	19565460	Thank you, Momenta.
19572460	19575460	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Good.
19575460	19577460	I think we should save this food for a while.
19577460	19580460	We might have to wait a long time for the explosions.
19580460	19582460	And they might not come tonight.
19582460	19584460	Stop stuffing yourself, Movement.
19584460	19586460	The rest is for a snuffkin and me.
19586460	19588460	But you can't eat anymore?
19588460	19590460	Yes, I can. We must share it in equal parts.
19590460	19592460	Otherwise, it's not fair.
19592460	19595460	I think it should be shared in proportion to how big one is.
19613460	19615460	Oh.
19621460	19623460	Hmm?
19623460	19625460	Ah, what are you back, John Brown?
19625460	19626460	From the sea.
19626460	19627460	Keep a sharp look down.
19627460	19629460	Look over there.
19631460	19633460	What is it?
19633460	19636460	Ah, ah. Wow.
19636460	19638460	Ah.
19639460	19643460	That's what I call fireworks.
19646460	19647460	Come on.
19647460	19649460	Somebody must be out there in a boat.
19659460	19661460	There's a boat.
19661460	19663460	The fireworks must have come from there.
19663460	19666460	Hey, come ashore.
19668460	19670460	Is that the hand you like?
19670460	19671460	No, I don't think so.
19671460	19674460	It looks like him, but he was much younger.
19674460	19677460	And so as a result of their excursion to the beach,
19677460	19679460	they finally learned that the big bangs
19679460	19683460	that had been waking everyone up were fireworks.
19683460	19685460	They also learned that the fireworks were coming
19685460	19688460	from a boat far out to sea.
19688460	19694460	But the man who had sent them up disappeared into the night.
19694460	19701460	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
19701460	19708460	They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.
19708460	19712460	They're always happy and goes at play.
19712460	19716460	The movements are having fun day after day.
19716460	19719460	The movements.
19719460	19723460	The movements.
19723460	19729460	The movements.
