1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're here for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I think it's a good idea.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. Here with me, here for you on your TV They are the movements, they are the movements

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So come with me, give me your hand

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll take you up to a moment land

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You can fly just like a bird

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Sing that song ever, there were the movements

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
There were the movements, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la Now it's very nice to get letters, at least every now and then.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
However, in Mumen Valley, they're rarely sent or received.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And yet they do have letter boxes and even postman.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:25,479
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, All in this time. What? Come on. This way, towards me. Come on.

18
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,000
Come on.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,800
Oh!

20
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
So, my God!

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,960
I got him!

22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,280
Did you take that hole?

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,800
Yeah.

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,639
No, weren't, didn't it?

25
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,439
All right.

26
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,159
Who's responsible for this?

27
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,280
Are you all right?

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,840
Did you take this hole, young woman?

29
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,879
Of course not.

30
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:51,460
Who was it then?

31
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,800
Hi, you I should have known.

32
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,000
Come here, you just wait.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,500
Uh, hold on, Mr. Postman. Can I help my letter please?

34
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:20,199
Just you wait. The past is too late.

35
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:21,400
Here's a letter, Mama.

36
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,960
Hmm.

37
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:24,400
A goodness, a letter.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I think it's from Mumble. Oh, really?

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Where's little my, Mum?

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, she's um...

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So, who's this letter from?

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's from my sister mumble, isn't it?

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, should I know?

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
She went on holiday to get away from me.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I bet she's coming back because she's missed all the fun.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,520
She'd stay away if she had it in the sense.

47
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,000
This is the third time I've fallen into a hole.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,360
Yes, I know.

49
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,280
But this is only the first time I've seen you do it.

50
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,639
What a horrible little child you are.

51
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,319
Artite.

52
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,080
Whoo!

53
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,240
Whoo, that was close.

54
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,159
Go on, fall off.

55
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,000
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Go on, Fola! Whoop!

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Come here, wait till I get my hands on you!

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Mumble says that she's coming back.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
She feels that she's ready to cope with Little My again.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh, that's good news, Mum and Mama.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I think that we should go and give her house a good clean.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,680
Have you told Little My now Mumbles coming?

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,040
She'll be able to go home.

64
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,600
No, I expect the postman is still chasing her

65
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,120
around the garden.

66
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,279
Don't tell me why I don't want to know.

67
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,079
Mama, mama, is the letter from Mumbles?

68
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,480
What does she have to say?

69
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,319
Is she coming home?

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And a few days later, Mumbles Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, That's Mum and Valley over there. It's not full of creepy crawlies, is it?

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Not as far as I know.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Is there a house over there?

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Maybe they have food, let's go.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh, that's Mum and House.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh!

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Are you going to Mumomin Valley, too?

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes, we got me red.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's nice, so am I.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We can go together.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Your suitcase looks very heavy.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Would you like a hand with me?

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No, no, no, no!

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Are they nice the people that live in that house?

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes they are.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Could we stay there?

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sure you can.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
My little sister is staying with them.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Follow me. I know the way. Shall we go?

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What's the matter?

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Nothing. We're following you.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
All right.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Mumbo!

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hello. How are you?

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Fine, you.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,800
Jamnice, rest without me. Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.

97
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,399
Oh, by the way, I'm at two very small strangers who said they were coming here.

98
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,399
Coming here, mumble?

99
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,199
Yes, they're both the same size as little mine.

100
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,600
Both a bit odd and they're carrying a very large suitcase.

101
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,500
Right, I'd better make them up a small double bed then.

102
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Thanks for the tea.

103
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Now are you ready to come home with me now little my?

104
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,000
No, not yet.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,500
We've got to go home and tidy the house.

106
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,000
It hasn't been aired for the whole winter.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,500
It's all right, mumble.

108
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,000
I cleaned and swept the floors the other day and opened all the doors and windows.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Thank you very much. It must have been a relief to be asleep most of the time with Lamai's been staying with you.

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
They said they haven't been bored once since we woke up, and we've had a really good time together.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Isn't that right, Mumen?

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Bye now.

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Well, well.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What does well-well me, Papa?

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Just that I might be able to hear myself think again now.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I know what you mean.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're not thingin' me. No, it's your turn to be great. What if they scream when they see us?

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But the lady told us they were friendly thingamy.

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Go on, do it.

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Excuse me?

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No, no, no.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, no.

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, no.

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, no.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Go on, do it.

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Excuse me?

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No!

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Now, what's the matter with you two?

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:45,080
Don't forget your suitcase, will you? I'm so glad to see you, Mom! What are you doing there? Oh.

130
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,480
Well, nobody said that you did.

131
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,639
Then you haven't come to arrest us.

132
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,840
Have you?

133
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,360
Of course I haven't.

134
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
I've come to see the movement family.

135
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,240
It is our suitcase.

136
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,919
It is.

137
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,639
Of course it is.

138
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,000
Now if you come to see the movements too?

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Hello?

140
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Oh, there you are. I thought it was you.

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Are you expecting these two guests, Smoomin Mama?

143
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I think so. And they've got a suitcase, so they must be staying.

144
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,120
That's nice. You will stay, won't you?

145
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Is it alright with you?

146
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,799
Of course it is. I'm Moomin' Mama.

147
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,320
I'm Dengany, and this is my friend Bob Moomin' Mama.

148
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,159
You're welcome. Come in and make yourselves at home.

149
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,360
I think it'll be okay, Dengany.

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Careful! He must must have drive it!

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
They are a bit strange, aren't they?

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes, definitely.

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So, what can I do for you today, Inspector?

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh, well, I heard that mumble was back from holiday, so...

155
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes, that's right.

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh, do you hear now?

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No inspector, I'm afraid she's gone home with little Mai.

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, right.

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I have to keep an eye on things, you know? Very important.

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Who goes away? Who comes back?

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, I'll say goodbye then, Mum and Baba.

162
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I do believe he's fallen for mumble.

163
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But has she fallen for him?

164
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I wonder.

165
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What if the new guests do he?

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Looking scared mostly.

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Who one, do one, do one. Here you are. I've emptied these drawers for you. There should be enough room. Thank you, Mormon.

168
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Where should we put this suitcase? Let's see.

169
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
In this drawer?

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh, the other place to hide too.

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh look at this.

172
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They made such a pretty bad boy's.

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I like the movements. They didn't scream at all.

174
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You still gotta be careful though. We've had some very strange people staying at our house, but I think these two are really weird.

175
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Well, they're northerners.

176
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I guess so, with names like Thingamy and Bob.

177
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And that suitcase.

178
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They look a lot like fugitives to me, Snuffkin.

179
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And perhaps they're dangerous criminals on the run.

180
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Do you want to see them?

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, I wouldn't mind, movement. Oh.

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Ah, there you are. What are they doing now?

183
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
No idea. I couldn't hear anything, so they must be asleep.

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We think they're fugitives, Moomin Papa. They're probably on the run from the law.

185
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, they are a bit funny about their suitcase.

186
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Gold coins.

187
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Stolen state secrets.

188
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Arsonists. We better hide all the matches, Papa.

189
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,159
Public enemies, numbers one and two,

190
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,840
but they don't look like it, though.

191
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,639
How about some tea, Snuffkin, sniff?

192
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,679
Yes, please.

193
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:36,600
Any cakes as well? Oh

194
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Bename Oh no! This suitcase is gone too! What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? You wake already? What a nerfie you're doing under the bed!

195
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's the safest place!

196
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Something's about to happen there! I can feel her coming.

197
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's what woke me up.

198
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Don't be silly. She can't know we're here.

199
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
She can. And I know she'll be here tonight.

200
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

201
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hmm. It's very windy tonight, moment.

202
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
MMM. You windy tonight, moment.

203
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Mmm, now chilly too, don't you think?

204
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Mmm, oh, hello.

205
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Did you sleep well?

206
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Would you like some tea?

207
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Hey, so that's them!

208
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Don't worry.

209
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
These are good friends of mine.

210
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Let me introduce you.

211
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Sniff and snuff can.

212
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And what's the matter?

213
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
She's coming! Yes, she is.

214
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Well, who is my dear?

215
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The girl. The girl.

216
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yes, she's terrible.

217
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Who?

218
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You know who she is?

219
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yes, I've never seen her, but I've heard she's a scary monster, all right?

220
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Scary monster?

221
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And this Grog is after you.

222
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yes, she is. Now don't you worry she'll think twice before she tangles with me.

223
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We'll see.

224
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
If she's a scary monster.

225
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Monster or not. If you're a guest in Moomin House, nothing will harm you.

226
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Right everyone. Like all the doors and you two go to your room.

227
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Thank you, Moomin Papa.

228
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,600
Nobody is going to get in here. I'm going to get in here. house nothing will harm you. Right everyone, lock all the doors and you two go to your room.

229
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:54,159
Thank you, Moran Papa. Nobody is gonna get in here. Well said. To Am's family, to Am's.

230
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:05,799
Ready for more tea, anyone? What's the matter? We're going to be attacked by a huge scary monster! Heavens!

231
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,700
You'd better get the frying pan, mama.

232
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,200
Oh, dear.

233
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,500
All right.

234
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:46,000
Has everyone got a weapon, huh? I'm going to get you. Well, it's midnight. I don't believe in that stupid grog. I hope you're right.

235
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I hope you're right.

236
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I hope you're right.

237
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I hope you're right.

238
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I hope you're right.

239
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I hope you're right.

240
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I hope you're right.

241
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I hope you're right.

242
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I hope you're right.

243
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I hope you're right.

244
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I hope you're right. I hope you're right.

245
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
She's coming. She's here.

246
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:33,599
Yes, she's very close now.

247
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm going home.

248
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,799
This is silly. We can't wait up all night. Besides, I'm getting very sleepy.

249
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,039
It's up to you. Right. I'm going, man moment papa. Watch your back.

250
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,359
Yes, keep in the open. Huh you guys are only trying to frighten me.

251
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,559
Well, it won't work.

252
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,000
She's here. No, she's not. There are no such things as monsters.

253
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Just a trap blowing a candle, though.

254
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Hmm.

255
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You see? There's nobody there.

256
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Well, in that case, there's nothing to stop you going home, Sniff.

257
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Hmm?

258
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Well, in that case, there's nothing to stop you going home, Sniff.

259
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

260
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You think I'm scared? You're making it up. Come on, admit it. There aren't any...

261
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Groakes!

262
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:56,400
Not at all. Well...

263
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You see? There's no one here at all! Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

264
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Oh.

265
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh.

266
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh.

267
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh.

268
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh, be careful.

269
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Watch what you're doing.

270
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's here.

271
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's here.

272
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Where?

273
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Hey, right outside that door.

274
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Big and black and horrible!

275
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Right.

276
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
No, don't open it!

277
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You'll get in!

278
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Come on, everybody.

279
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Well, there's nobody here, Sniff.

280
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Are you sure?

281
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I can't see anything. I must have scared that silly old Groc away, moment!

282
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That will teach her to come sniffing around here, all right?

283
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What the fash is?

284
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:05,720
WAAAAAAA!

285
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,640
Mm-hmm, Mrs. Groke, we'd like you to go home.

286
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,140
Now you just go on.

287
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,000
You're upsetting our guests.

288
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And you're freezing my roses?

289
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yes, you big bully.

290
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm sorry, but you really must leave.

291
00:20:34,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Please go before I count to ten. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine and a half. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

292
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Hey!

293
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Hey!

294
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Hey!

295
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Hey!

296
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Hey!

297
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Hey!

298
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Hey!

299
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Hey!

300
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Hey!

301
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Hey!

302
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Hey!

303
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Hey!

304
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Hey!

305
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Hey!

306
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Hey!

307
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Hey!

308
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Hey!

309
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Hey!

310
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Hey!

311
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Are you alright, Moomboma? Look at the ground!

312
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's all frozen! Help me, Dad!

313
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Help me, Dad!

314
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's a Groke's voice!

315
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's cold!

316
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Isn't it?

317
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I don't think she'll be back tonight. It's cold, isn't it?

318
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I don't think she'll be back tonight.

319
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Let's all go in and have a hot drink.

320
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The Groke didn't come back that night,

321
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
but what did she want in the movement house?

322
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And will she return perhaps another night

323
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
when they're all asleep.

324
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
