123600	127800	Moomin Papa was a very kind and handsome young man a voice from the past
129280	131280	Moomin Papa liquid. I've got for you
135840	138340	Oh, no, I was
139100	145620	Moomin Mama, I think you should go back to the kitchen. Whatever for a little
145620	151980	My because Moomin Papa's stormy youth is catching up with him. Please Papa tell us it's not that kind of letter
157380	161780	Whatever it was it was a long time ago long before I ever met you
162180	164180	No, it's not that kind of letter
165180	171540	What sort of letter is it then? Oh much worse. It's from Aunt Jane. Who's that?
172020	178820	Mine my dear is on my father's side. Oh, how boring. You look very pale suddenly dear
179460	187060	Yes, because she's coming for a visit tomorrow. Oh, don't worry. There's plenty of time for arranging a welcome party
187700	191460	But I don't like her and I don't want it to come for a visit
191540	196660	Moomin Papa, why not? Well, you'll soon see she's very rich very rich
197620	205220	Yes, and she bosses everyone and we won't have a moment of peace. Oh, maybe she's so rich. She'll give us all wonderful presents
205620	210420	Goodness, this is so unexpected. Why is she coming here all of a sudden? Oh
211300	216580	She says she wants to discuss money matter as good heavens with me. She says there's no one else
216820	221060	So you see I'm in a very difficult situation. Oh, why can't you tell if you're not an expert
222100	228100	You don't tell Aunt Jane things. She tells you when that's that is not explained when you meet her
228180	230180	You'll know exactly what I mean
230420	235380	What do I know about money matters nothing? Not surprising since we've never had any
235940	242580	How can she expect a poor creature like you to know anything about money? Also, she's very very suspicious
243140	245140	And she says money is a terrible burden
245780	248260	Oh, I wouldn't mind shouldering her burden
248900	253700	Maybe you'll inherit it, and then we could share the money and have a wonderful time together
254340	256340	Hey
274260	277460	This time I almost did it
284580	286580	So
287060	291220	Moving Papa has a rich and very interesting
292500	296900	Yes, she's got so much money. She doesn't know what to do with it all. Oh
297700	304180	So snorke, why don't you ask her to invest in your flying ship? You'll need money to rebuild won't you?
304500	310340	It would be a great investment for her. It certainly would be. I'm sure she jump at it. Hmm
311060	313060	There'd be no harm in asking, I guess
313140	315140	Oh
335300	338900	What's the matter, Mr. Hemiellen? You look so unhappy
339700	342340	I'm stuck that's my problem. How's that?
343540	348260	Stuck in my research this magnifying glass is very good, of course
348500	353380	But I just can't get any further with my botanical research with this old-fashioned equipment
354420	357780	What I really need is a microscope and a laboratory
358980	363060	And they're expensive, I guess. Yes, they are and I don't have any money
363620	368900	Well moment Papa's aunt is coming over tomorrow and I know she's got any amount of money
369300	370500	Any amount?
371220	377620	I'll get her to finance you, Hemiellen and we'll get a big greenhouse and you'll grow orchids and roses and other things
377780	381460	And then we'll sell them. Oh, I'll get rich. You too
399860	411460	Hey, you over there. Hmm. Are you talking to me? Of course I am. Who else?
415860	421780	I said you know the way to move in a house young man. Yes, she might say I do show me where it is then
422500	427060	Over there. It's tall and blue. Just follow that stream and you can't miss it
427860	432740	Good would you be kind enough to take my suitcase? I'm sorry. I can't. I'm too busy
433220	436500	I'll reward you handsomely for your efforts. Think again young man
436980	438980	But all I want to do is fish
439220	441220	What you don't want money
445060	449460	I heard you were coming to visit moment papa. You're in Jane, aren't you? Oh well
449860	454420	Please to meet you. I'm here to take you to moment house. Is this your suitcase?
458020	463700	Wow, this suitcase is very heavy. Should they? It's full of golden coins
479460	486260	I can't stay in this house. I don't think I can take Aunt Jane. I'm going to hide out in the cave until she's gone
487140	489140	Oh
492020	494020	Bye-bye, Lindaer
494180	498420	Careful now, Aunt Jane. The banks have been slippery here and there
506500	510100	Around house house stupid typical of my nephew
511460	513940	Welcome to moment house Aunt Jane
513940	515940	Welcome Aunt Jane
516420	518420	I'd like you to meet us on moment
519460	521460	Please to meet you
523060	530500	She's very small for a daughter. Oh little my isn't ours. She just lives here and I won't get any bigger either
532260	537860	She's like a member of the family and was my worthless nephew. Why isn't he here? Oh
538340	545620	Well, he's a not a is he not at home? Well, no when will he be back? I don't know
546020	551620	He's away looking for inspiration for his work. So he won't be back for a while since when has he worked?
551780	558340	I'm here to see him. Maybe you can see me instead. What a splendid idea. How clever of you, movement
558820	564820	Ridiculous. He knows nothing about money in that case. It is high time. He learned as for his father
565060	567060	I may still disinherit him
568420	575700	I'm a member of his family too. I could talk to you about money matters. Really? Oh sniff is a great friend of mine
576260	578260	Hmm
579300	581300	But hardly a member of the family
583060	590100	Hello moment and you must be on Jane. I brought my brother to snark with me. He wanted to meet you
592420	594420	This is Aunt Jane be nice to
595380	602100	Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane. This is my lovely sister snort maiden who is moving special friend
602500	608260	The snorts and the movements may one day be related so in a way we're all really family
608580	610820	You maybe but not to me
611380	619780	I'm an inventor and due to an accident. I'm looking around for a sponsor a golden opportunity for anyone with some loose capital
620340	622900	Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane
623700	633620	I'm him milling a botanist of note. I heard that you might be willing to fund my scientific research and chain a golden opportunity for anyone with some spare money
634260	636260	You'd like me to fund your research
636900	642980	It was my idea if we built a greenhouse and grow rare orchids and roses we can make a lot of money
643460	647460	And you'll make a lot of money young man. I have a lot of money already
647860	651140	Oh, hasn't sniffed discuss this with you ma'am. You sniffed
651300	654500	Well, I was just getting around to it, Hamilton. Confusing
654660	660100	When I am famous for my botanical research and Jane, I don't know that will ever happen
660260	665140	This is very confusing indeed for me now. You're snork maiden a friend of movement is that right?
665300	672660	Oh, no, I'm the snork snort maiden's brother. I'm a friend of Moomin at Jane. Did you really explain about my important research sniff?
672980	675460	Did you really explain that I'm a member of the family?
675460	683060	Hey, she got it. So, Jane would be great if you weren't a member to make your own coin coin everyone
695780	703380	Here's your room, Jane. I do hope you'll be comfortable here. Just call if you need anything
705860	707860	Oh
711700	713700	Come out
718500	721540	Here's your suitcase. It was very heavy. Thank you
724980	726980	And him
727300	734180	What is it you want a reward? No, no, Jane. I mean, yes, I do but
734660	736660	Uh
736660	743620	Which is it will you make up your mind young man? I know where Moomin Papa is right now. He's a whale on a trip
743620	749460	I know. No, no. He's somewhere quite near quite near here. Well, where is he?
750180	755140	Moomin Papa said not to tell you where he's hiding. It's a secret. A secret? Yes
755700	761060	I suppose I can tell you but he'll be very angry. Where is he? Tell me now. Oh, well
761780	763780	If I tell you I'm taking a big risk
765060	768980	Oh, very well. How much do you want? I'll leave that to you
769700	771700	Oh
793460	797460	Thank you for the information now you shall have your reward held out your hand
799860	800980	Oh
800980	805300	Is that all until I've seen him for myself with my own eyes. Yes
811940	813940	Huh
814740	820660	Oh, there's nobody here. Where is my worthless nephew? This is very strange
822580	826740	You tricked me haven't you? Well, no, I swear I would never do that
827220	830420	You certainly deserve no reward
831060	839220	Uh, but no way if we just look around we'll find him. He's in here somewhere. I know it. Hey, Moomin Papa, I got rid of her
845380	850740	Moomin mom. Yes, Aunt Jane. What is it? Tell me where my nephew is hiding
851860	854580	Well as I said before I want to know the truth
855140	858020	There he he's now let me see
858340	859860	Come on hurry up
860100	866180	He's hiding in the cave down by the beach. I've just been there Moomin Mama and I can't find him
867300	872180	Then he really must have gone away on a trip and why should he want to hide from me anyway
872660	878340	I think he might be a little bit afraid of you afraid of me afraid of his own hand
879460	882580	But why mostly he's afraid of money matters
882580	884180	Incredible
884180	886340	Afraid of me because of money matters
887300	889300	He must be utterly mad
890420	892420	What a family
892420	894420	I don't understand
894580	897220	It seems that only Smith knows anything about money
900340	902740	I know where Moomin Papa is right now
902740	905540	So you want some of my gold who do you young lady?
906100	908820	I couldn't care less about your silly gold
908820	910980	My silly gold indeed
910980	914420	With silly gold, I assure you you can do just anything you want
914420	919460	Seems to me your silly gold doesn't even help you to find Moomin Papa
919860	922580	Hmm? I think you should forget about your money
923300	926740	Young lady, money isn't something you can just forget about
926740	928740	It needs constant looking after
928740	931460	That's why I must talk to Moomin Papa at once
931460	933860	Now take me to that rascal nephew of mine
933860	936020	If you really know where he is, do you hear me?
939780	941780	Do you hear me?
941780	944820	Oh yes, I do
944820	946820	Do you hear me?
946820	948820	Of course
950820	952820	Oh wow frivolous
952820	955620	Not really, if I could find a small enough boyfriend
955620	958020	I'd be frivolous just like them too
958020	960820	Oh well, Frederick and I were frivolous once
960820	962820	Really? If you say so
962820	964820	I suppose I have to believe you
969620	970420	Fuck
970420	974820	What? Little May and Anne Jane walking together
976820	978820	What are they doing?
978820	980820	Little May is plotting something
980820	982820	Really?
982820	984820	Moomin?
988820	990820	Sniff's all right really
990820	996820	But sometimes he just can't withstand the lure of gold
996820	998820	Check me
998820	1000820	No, we can't be right
1000820	1002820	Let's go back then
1004820	1006820	Fine, just take your time
1006820	1008820	Hi guys
1008820	1010820	Little May, what's the matter?
1010820	1012820	We have a guest
1012820	1014820	A guest
1014820	1016820	Moomin Papa
1016820	1018820	What?
1018820	1020820	Moomin Papa
1020820	1026820	Oh, so this is where you've been hiding?
1026820	1028820	Oh, what else?
1028820	1030820	You just wait
1030820	1032820	Oh, you shoot
1032820	1036820	Oh, I have seen Moomin
1036820	1038820	Wait a minute
1038820	1040820	No, you wait first
1040820	1042820	Wait a minute
1042820	1044820	Wait please
1044820	1046820	Moomin Papa was sort of on his way back from a trip
1046820	1048820	and then stopped by to play chess with me
1048820	1050820	Yes, exactly
1050820	1052820	No, yes, Moomin Mama told her the truth
1052820	1056820	Oh, I sort of stopped by
1056820	1058820	Why are you so afraid of me, young man?
1058820	1060820	Well, I'm not really
1060820	1062820	I mean, it's not you
1062820	1064820	It's your money, I'm afraid of it
1064820	1066820	Really scares me
1066820	1068820	Scared of my money?
1068820	1070820	Well, I know
1070820	1072820	It's perfectly good money at all in gold coins
1072820	1076820	Listen, nephew, I'm depending on you as my only relative
1076820	1078820	Yes, yes, please depend
1078820	1082820	When I get too old to do it, you must look after my gold for me
1082820	1084820	I'm relying on you
1084820	1086820	No, that's not possible
1086820	1088820	I know, and Jane, we can give it all away
1088820	1090820	Must be those who'd love to have it
1090820	1092820	Must be those who need it more than we do
1092820	1094820	Oh, and green
1094820	1096820	Oh
1096820	1098820	Ah
1098820	1100820	Ah
1100820	1102820	Ah
1102820	1104820	Ah
1104820	1106820	Ah
1106820	1108820	She's crazy
1108820	1112820	Don't worry, we'll think of something
1112820	1116820	Oh, you would throw my money away without a cut
1116820	1118820	Why didn't mean to hurt you, Jane?
1118820	1120820	I know, let's put it all in the bank
1120820	1122820	Money likes being in the bank
1122820	1128820	My money would hate being in a back of a terrible idea
1128820	1132820	Oh no, banks are so nice nowadays
1132820	1140820	Of course, they have flowers and shiny piggy banks and pretty paintings on the wall
1140820	1142820	Is that really true?
1142820	1146820	Right, come on everybody
1146820	1150820	Let's hurry home and fix a welcoming party for Jane
1150820	1154820	Yes, any reason is good enough
1164820	1168820	This was Grandma's best cake recipe, welcome at Jane
1168820	1174820	Let's drink a toast to the only millionaire in our small circle
1174820	1180820	May she live a long and healthy life, cheers, cheers
1186820	1190820	Now, this is your welcoming party at Jane, what's the matter?
1190820	1194820	Never in my life of I and my money felt ourselves as welcome before
1194820	1198820	I'm so happy I could cry
1198820	1202820	And once you start crying, you just want to go on
1202820	1206820	Please don't be unhappy, Jane, don't cry
1206820	1210820	Oh, dear, mum and Papa
1210820	1212820	Mum and Papa
1212820	1214820	Yes, Jane, what is it?
1214820	1218820	I'll put some of my gold in a bank, but you must look after the rest when I'm too old
1218820	1220820	Oh, hmm
1220820	1222820	And why not?
1222820	1228820	All right, we'll keep it in the cellar and make a nice little niche for it with seashells and moss
1228820	1232820	Someone go down and look at it every week, don't you worry, Jane, your money will be in safe hands
1232820	1236820	Not quite, but I had in mind
1236820	1238820	I know
1238820	1240820	But I suppose it can't be helped
1240820	1244820	It sounds rather nice, a cozy little niche down in the cellar
1244820	1248820	And if you take a look every week, but oh dear, it will miss me
1248820	1250820	Oh, and Jane
1250820	1254820	Very well, I have made up my mind
1254820	1258820	Leaving this sickest with you now, so you and my gold can get certain used to each other
1258820	1262820	Do what you want with it, your friends seem to have ideas about how to spend it
1262820	1266820	Flying ships and botanical research sound rather splendid
1266820	1270820	Oh, oh, wonder
1270820	1272820	I'm so happy for you
1272820	1276820	Darn, I should have let us up better than flowers
1276820	1280820	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
1280820	1284820	So ended the visit of the dreaded Anne Jane
1284820	1290820	And I'm sure Sniff will be able to think of some other use for the gold
1292820	1298820	They love the laughter, and they love the living, the movements
1298820	1306820	We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements
1306820	1310820	They're always happy and always at play
1310820	1317820	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements
1317820	1327820	The movements, the movements
