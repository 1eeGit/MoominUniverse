0	21000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me,
21000	29000	Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,
29000	35000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land,
35000	43000	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements,
43000	58000	There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,
58000	59000	Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
88000	118000	da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
118000	120700	Dan, do you think it's broken, Papa?
120700	124500	Well, I'm not sure. I've not had a great deal of experience with this sort of thing.
130100	133400	Look over there, Moomin. It's the boy and the fisherman from the boat.
135300	136900	They're a bit strange, aren't they?
137000	138900	They must live somewhere here on the island.
141900	142900	Let's see.
148000	148500	What?
158000	162500	Oh, thank you. Leave it by the door when you haven't quite finished yet.
163500	165500	Well, at least we can see the floor now.
166000	168000	I think the keeper must be lying dead under the desk.
170000	173000	Nobody's cleaned here for a long time. That's for sure.
173000	176500	That probably means the lighthouse lamp hasn't been working for ages either.
177500	179500	I wonder if Papa will be able to fix it.
180500	183500	I wonder if they're going to manage to get the light working all right.
186500	189500	Well, the lighthouse without a lamp is pretty sad, isn't it?
194500	196500	Come on, light, will you?
196500	198500	Right, I'll give you one last chance.
202500	206000	Then I'm getting the big spanner. Now you don't know me, but I don't give in easily.
206000	207500	Especially to machines.
207500	216000	Have you thought brass brain what will happen tonight if there's a storm and there's a ship out there looking for land or trying to keep off the rocks and there's no light to guide them?
216000	218000	You'll be sorry Dan, but it'll be too late.
218000	225500	And all I can say is that if the light hasn't been working for some time that I'm afraid that there could have been many shipwrecks.
225500	226500	Oh, that's awful.
226500	230500	Well, it would be dangerous to come too close to the island without a light to help you.
230500	233000	I wouldn't be surprised if that ghost ship went one of them.
234000	240000	It all seems very strange, and I wonder what made the lighthouse keeper leave in such a hurry.
240000	244000	Unspeakable horror. Please be quiet, little my.
244000	249000	It's obvious. Close, thrown above dishes left unwashed, jigsaw puzzles have finished.
249000	253000	It's an unsolved mystery of the sea, just like the Marie Celeste.
253000	258000	And if you don't understand that, then you're being even stupider. Then usual.
258000	262000	Oh, dear poor man, I wonder what he was like.
262000	266000	He must have been very lonely here on his own.
266000	270000	He scribbled messages over the walls like no side of a ship.
270000	276000	It's Christmas, another month gone. I must clean the lamp, and I need to talk to someone.
278000	283000	Oh, well, if he didn't see many ships, at least they could have been many shipwrecks either.
283000	287000	Oh, I hope not, Papa. That would be one good thing anyway.
287000	292000	Perhaps the sea came and took him on a dark and stormy night, and he was swept out and no one saw him go.
292000	299000	That's rubbish, little my. On dark and stormy nights, lighthouse keeper sits safe by a fire drinking hot tea laced with rum.
299000	302000	He might have run out of rum and gone to get more.
302000	309000	Well, I don't think anything terrible happened to him. He just got more and more lonely and fed up and then went off and got a girlfriend.
309000	314000	Be careful, snuffkin. It's very rough, but not even, and you don't want to fall into the sea.
314000	318000	I certainly don't. Now, watch your step. The rocks are very slippery.
318000	322000	Well, are you all right?
322000	326000	Yes, Lang, so I didn't think they'd be a slippery is all that.
326000	331000	What's the matter? Look over there. There's something moving, but I can't see what it is.
331000	333000	It's probably a boat.
333000	336000	No, that's what I call a real ship.
336000	338000	It's not a real one.
338000	339000	What do you mean?
339000	343000	It's the ghost ship, the one we saw last night.
343000	348000	You're right. Why isn't it come back, snuffkin? What does it want?
348000	354000	I don't know. Perhaps it followed us to the island and for some reason wants to make contact.
360000	364000	Let's go home, snuffkin. I don't like this.
373000	379000	What's up?
379000	391000	Oh, no. Shut up. I'm having a great dream, and you can see the view.
391000	395000	Wait. Oh, it was horrible. Someone stepped on my face.
395000	399000	Well, none of us sleepwalking since we were all asleep. Why don't you just be quiet?
399000	404000	They're very odd.
404000	410000	No, somebody's on my stomach now. Don't be stupid.
410000	416000	Oh, have a look, snuffkin. There must be something there. Please, snuffkin, please.
416000	420000	I can't see any. What's that?
420000	421000	What is it?
421000	425000	I don't know yet, movement. I think I can see a pair of feet.
425000	427000	A pair of feet.
427000	429000	My legs just feet.
429000	431000	But that means a ghost.
431000	434000	Oh, help. Get it off me. Go away, go away.
434000	440000	Let me at them. Where are they? I'll teach them to spoil my dream.
440000	442000	They're on my face now. Go away, will you?
442000	445000	No. Show me it. But no, stamp on it.
445000	446000	Stop it, move away.
446000	449000	No, it's my fault.
457000	467000	You go fishing again today. No, I'm not.
467000	472000	Oh, do you need me or is it all right if I go and see those people in the lighthouse?
472000	474000	No, I don't want you one.
474000	478000	Okay, goodbye then.
481000	484000	You mean this room is really haunted?
484000	486000	It certainly is.
486000	489000	But we only saw a pair of feet.
489000	492000	I'll sleep here tonight. Don't worry, I'll protect you.
492000	495000	Are you going to scare it away, Papa?
498000	500000	I can't find any good shells.
500000	502000	You're me.
506000	508000	What about this one?
508000	510000	Oh yes, that's lovely.
511000	514000	Go on, take it. I don't collect them.
517000	518000	Who are you?
518000	520000	Well, I'm a ghost, sort of.
520000	522000	Are you the rat who walked over us last night?
522000	524000	You were lucky I didn't grab you.
524000	527000	Sorry, it wasn't just me. There were a few of us.
527000	528000	Now walk over each other.
528000	530000	Can I give you a present?
530000	532000	You can't get around me that easily.
532000	534000	You better show yourselves or you'll be sorry.
534000	539000	It's just me. The others have all left me and gone off with the ship.
539000	542000	Ha, so why didn't you go with them?
542000	545000	Oh, I wanted to, but well...
545000	546000	Come on, out with it.
546000	547000	Well...
547000	552000	Never got me and let me all of my own and I was frightened.
552000	556000	Well, I can see why they wouldn't want a drippy thing like you around.
556000	558000	You call yourself a ghost.
558000	561000	I know, I'm sorry.
561000	564000	I just can't work out what's wrong with it.
564000	567000	Let's try and see what happens here.
568000	575000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, heavens, oh my, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
575000	576000	Oh, no!
584000	585000	You were right, Pop-Up!
585000	587000	Oh, thank goodness you are here, quick!
587000	589000	Open all the windows, I'm choking!
589000	595000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
595000	597000	Oh, my God.
610000	614000	Mmm, this is great. That soup I've had for ages, Moome and Mama.
614000	615000	Would you like some more?
615000	617000	Oh, he has, please.
617000	622000	Can I have the recipe? I could make some for the fisherman. I know he'd love it.
622000	625000	I'll write it out for you. What's his name?
625000	627000	I don't know. He doesn't say.
627000	631000	I've come from the north. I left about three months ago,
631000	636000	although it seems a lot longer, and I'd been rowing south in my small boat,
636000	638000	trying to reach Moome and Valley.
638000	640000	Oh, really? We live there.
640000	643000	Do you? You're lucky. It must be very nice. I've never been there,
643000	645000	but I've heard that it's beautiful.
645000	648000	Anyway, there was a violent storm in my little boat capsized.
648000	652000	He rescued me, and I've stayed with him in his cabin ever since.
652000	656000	And he doesn't talk about himself at all. That's very strange.
656000	659000	No, but I think he does have a big secret.
659000	661000	How do you know, Taft?
661000	666000	Well, sometimes he just stares and stares at the lighthouse in any sort of size.
666000	667000	I wonder why.
667000	671000	I did ask him once, but he glared at me in such a nasty way.
671000	673000	I haven't dared say a word about it since.
673000	675000	You don't want to stay with him then?
676000	679000	Oh, yes. Well, most of the time he's really nice to me,
679000	682000	and since I've been here, I've sort of taken care of him,
682000	685000	because you see he doesn't really look after himself.
685000	688000	Could I have a cup of tea, please, Mama?
688000	691000	Yes, dear. How is the light coming along?
691000	694000	Oh, not very well. There's still a few more things I could try, though.
694000	697000	Hello. You were on that boat fishing, weren't you?
697000	700000	Yes, I was. My name is Taft, Mum and Papa.
700000	702000	Oh, please, to meet you.
702000	705000	Is your friend here as well? I wanted to ask him something.
705000	707000	There's something quite important.
707000	708000	Ask him what?
708000	710000	Well, about this lighthouse for one thing.
710000	713000	Well, he won't talk about that. He just refuses to.
713000	715000	Oh, dear, does he?
715000	718000	The thing is, I'm trying to light this beacon, but having no success.
718000	721000	I wondered whether he might know if there's an easy way of doing it.
721000	724000	You never know. I might have missed something.
724000	726000	It's very quiet.
727000	729000	He might be out fishing, you know.
729000	731000	Come on, let's go.
731000	732000	Where are you going, Moomin?
732000	734000	I want to ask that man some questions.
734000	737000	He doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who does a lot of talking.
737000	740000	Do you think he might know something about the lighthouse keeper?
740000	742000	That's what I want to find out.
750000	754000	Hello. My name is Moomin, and this is my friend, Snuffkin.
754000	757000	What's your business here?
757000	760000	I wonder, do you live here?
760000	764000	I suppose you must have met the lighthouse keeper, have you?
764000	766000	I don't want people to have other matters.
766000	770000	We were just curious about why you left the lighthouse. Do you know why?
770000	773000	No, you kept himself to himself.
773000	776000	Oh, so you do know it. When did he leave?
776000	778000	Where did he go? You must know.
778000	779000	Get.
779000	783000	Oh, please. Had the light stopped working before he left?
783000	786000	Why did he leave the door open? Were there any shipwrecks?
787000	790000	Wait a minute, just one more question, please.
790000	791000	Oh, don't go.
791000	793000	There's something very important I need to know.
793000	796000	You're the only other person on the island apart from the ghost ship.
796000	798000	Oh, no, please, come back.
798000	802000	Look, my father is trying to get the lamp working again, but not getting anywhere.
802000	806000	So if you know where the keeper is, or better still, how to light it,
806000	807000	will you please help?
807000	811000	It's not only for us, but for all those ships that might be in danger without it.
812000	813000	Oh.
815000	816000	Moomin.
817000	820000	I don't think that man knows much about anything.
820000	824000	Well, at least he's heard you and knows what you want.
824000	825000	Let's go, Moomin.
825000	826000	Moomin.
840000	844000	Look, over there, what's Moomin Papa doing?
844000	847000	Snort made an a little Maya helping him.
847000	848000	Hiya!
849000	850000	Come on.
850000	851000	Yeah.
852000	856000	It's about time. Where are you two being?
856000	858000	What are you building now?
858000	859000	We're making a raft.
859000	860000	Why?
860000	861000	Because we wanted to stupid.
861000	862000	Why else would we build it?
862000	863000	Do you like it?
863000	865000	But why do you want a raft?
865000	867000	It's not really a raft, is it Papa?
867000	871000	Let me present our very own hand-built ghost ship.
871000	872000	A ghost ship?
875000	877000	He must be here somewhere.
877000	880000	Well, if he's the one that walked on me last night,
880000	882000	I want a word with him.
882000	883000	Yes, sorry.
883000	885000	I'm afraid that was me and my friends.
885000	887000	Oh, where are you?
887000	888000	Show us a bit of leg, at least.
888000	890000	I like to see you I'm talking to.
890000	893000	Yes, all right.
893000	897000	Oh, well, at least he looks like a ghost.
897000	898000	Thank you.
898000	901000	Ghosts look pretty silly when the sun's shining if you ask me.
901000	903000	Well, it was your idea.
903000	905000	I always thought ghosts were frightening me.
905000	907000	Yes, we forgot our chains last night.
908000	910000	It's very hard to be ghostly without them.
910000	912000	We did our best to scare you, though.
912000	915000	The ghost came to this island because the lighthouse was a bit like an ancient castle.
915000	917000	We feel more at home in castle.
917000	920000	And now when they found us here, they changed their minds and gave up.
920000	922000	That's funny, isn't it?
922000	924000	What's the matter?
924000	926000	You look a bit fed up.
926000	929000	That's because he's been left behind by the other ghosts.
929000	931000	They've gone off in the ghost ship.
931000	934000	Wow, they didn't tell me they were going straight away.
934000	936000	And I'd gone to the lighthouse keepers cabin.
936000	938000	The lighthouse keeper?
938000	939000	Why did you go there?
939000	942000	Well, I wanted to tell him that some strange people.
942000	943000	I'm sorry.
943000	947000	I mean, strangers had moved into the lighthouse and that he'd be better off with us
947000	949000	because ghosts don't damage things.
949000	951000	I didn't know you then, of course.
951000	953000	But some people are very kind.
953000	954000	Where is his cabin?
954000	955000	Is it easy to find?
955000	957000	At the southern end of the island.
957000	960000	But it was a waste of time because he wouldn't talk to me.
960000	961000	I shouldn't have bothered.
961000	963000	And then I would have caught the boat.
963000	965000	Anyway, he's not going back to his job.
965000	967000	So that's that.
967000	968000	Bye-bye.
968000	970000	Thanks again for the raft.
970000	971000	Take care.
971000	974000	I hope you catch up with your friends real soon.
974000	975000	Thank you.
975000	976000	You're okay for mortals.
976000	979000	I promise next time we meet up he rallies, Gary.
979000	980000	Chains and all.
980000	981000	Lots of chains.
981000	983000	And we promise to be terrified.
983000	986000	You can come and scare me anytime you want.
986000	988000	Bye-bye.
988000	989000	Relating a charm.
989000	990000	Bye-bye.
990000	993000	He said anything that could float would do.
993000	995000	But that raft seemed a bit flimsy to me.
995000	996000	I wouldn't like to chance it.
996000	998000	It can be rough out there.
998000	1000000	Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
1000000	1001000	Ghost can't drown.
1001000	1002000	Can they?
1002000	1003000	They're dead already.
1011000	1012000	Mama.
1012000	1014000	What is it, Moomin, dear?
1014000	1016000	Poppa's gone fishing again.
1016000	1018000	Well, he's gone fishing again.
1019000	1021000	Well, he enjoys it.
1021000	1024000	Well, that's all he seems to do these days.
1024000	1026000	He's not working on the lamp at all.
1026000	1029000	Well, perhaps living in a new place makes him want to do a new thing.
1029000	1032000	And he does catch one now and again.
1038000	1040000	What are you making, little boy?
1040000	1041000	An elevator.
1041000	1042000	An elevator?
1042000	1045000	Yes, and when that's finished, I'm going to build a house.
1045000	1047000	Oh, my goodness.
1047000	1049000	A house of my very own.
1060000	1063000	Moomin, Papa, doesn't seem his usual happy self,
1063000	1065000	even though he enjoys his fishing.
1065000	1069000	He's upset that he couldn't make the lamp work and isn't used to failure,
1069000	1072000	but nothing he tries makes any difference.
1072000	1076000	What a pity it would be to leave the island without seeing the beautiful beams
1076000	1078000	shining over the water.
1079000	1081000	Oh, my goodness.
1081000	1083000	Oh, my goodness.
1105000	1107000	Yeah, hey, come and have a look.
1107000	1109000	Everyone, I finished my house.
1110000	1113000	Hey, Moomin, Papa, come here. The fisherman's coming.
1113000	1115000	Wow, the fisherman.
1118000	1120000	Yes, and the boy is with him.
1120000	1121000	The loft is outside.
1128000	1130000	You don't want to do it, do you?
1130000	1132000	No, but I've got to do it.
1134000	1135000	Right.
1140000	1141000	Here you are.
1149000	1152000	So, uh, what can we do for you?
1159000	1160000	Oh!
1163000	1166000	Happy birthday. Happy birthday to you.
1166000	1167000	Hmm?
1167000	1170000	Tough just told us it's your birthday today,
1170000	1172000	so all the best wishes from us.
1172000	1175000	My birthday? Is it really?
1175000	1178000	Excuse me for asking, but how old are you?
1178000	1180000	I just don't remember.
1181000	1184000	It doesn't matter. I'm sorry we don't have any presents.
1187000	1190000	I haven't had coffee for many, many years.
1193000	1195000	Bring the barrel, Moomin, Mama.
1195000	1196000	Yes, dear.
1197000	1200000	Now, let me see, I found this sauerster.
1201000	1204000	I wonder if it suits me. What do you think?
1204000	1205000	Oh.
1205000	1208000	I suppose this must belong to the lighthouse keeper.
1211000	1213000	Why don't you try it on?
1213000	1216000	You look good in a sauerster. There it suits you.
1219000	1221000	We'd love to know why you left the island
1221000	1223000	and why you didn't come back in
1223000	1226000	and also why you didn't like the land.
1226000	1229000	We really would like to know if you feel you could tell us.
1231000	1233000	I was so lonely.
1233000	1235000	For years and years.
1236000	1238000	Then I just went away.
1239000	1241000	I'm afraid that's all.
1243000	1246000	But you did come back. Surely that must mean something.
1247000	1249000	I knew I'd lived here for too long.
1249000	1251000	Much too long.
1252000	1255000	You see, I didn't really fit in anywhere else.
1261000	1264000	This is the lighthouse keeper's uniform, isn't it?
1264000	1266000	Why don't you put it on again?
1266000	1268000	And look, it's nice here.
1268000	1270000	I'd like to stay with you, mind that.
1270000	1272000	I'll stay if you let me.
1272000	1274000	Ah, I'd love that.
1274000	1278000	It'd be fun to see you looking like a lighthouse keeper.
1282000	1284000	Oh, hooray!
1284000	1287000	Oh, hooray!
1294000	1297000	Three days later, the movements left the island.
1297000	1299000	They decided to leave at night
1299000	1302000	with the safe blow of the lighthouse beams guiding their path
1302000	1305000	out in the way to movement valley.
1305000	1308000	Movement papa had quite forgotten about his epic novel of the sea,
1308000	1311000	but couldn't wait to start again on his memoirs.
1325000	1331000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1332000	1339000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1340000	1343000	They're always happy and always at play.
1343000	1347000	The movements are having fun day after day.
1347000	1350000	The movements.
1350000	1354000	The movements.
1354000	1360000	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1362000	1369000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1369000	1373000	They're always happy and always at play.
1373000	1377000	The movements are having fun day after day.
1377000	1380000	The movements.
1380000	1384000	The movements.
1384000	1390000	The movements.
1391000	1396000	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
