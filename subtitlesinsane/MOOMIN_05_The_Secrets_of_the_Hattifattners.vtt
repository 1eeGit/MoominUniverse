    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They're for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:30.239
They are the movements, there are the movements,

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:37.640
so come with me give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just

00:00:37.640 --> 00:01:47.000
like a bird, sing the bass song ever, there were a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la- Bapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapap I think that rope is getting loose. Okay, Moonman, you'd better have a look before this wind has the whole tent down.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I, I, Captain.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
A sudden storm has hit the happy fatness I've had.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Papa, I think that rope is getting loose.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Okay, Moonman, you'd better have a look before this wind has the whole tent down.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.400
I, I, Captain.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.400
A sudden storm has hit the havy fad in this island.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:21.199
Mumen Papa has decided that it would be far safer to stay the night on the island,

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.360
so they put up the tent and moored the boat. This will show us what the weather's up to.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.319
That's as long as it's still working.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.599
I'm sure it's going to die down really soon.

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.520
I wake up, Mr. Hemmler.

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.699
When the storm clears, we must give this barometer

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.879
straight back to the haddy fatness.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.680
Oh, I quite fancy keeping it myself to remind me of the island.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.280
You know, it seems to work after all.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.719
But Mr. Hemelon, that'll only remind you

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.680
of the horrible haddy fatness.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.199
What about all the tons of plants you've found?

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.000
That surely is going to be enough?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Yes, I know, but there was only really one special flower amongst all those plants,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and I nearly missed that one.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Look, he's in a beauty.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I discovered it as I was about to tie up the boat.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Oh, woman, Papa.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Yes, Mr. Hermann.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.439
You know when you all went to put up the tent, you told me to tie up the boat so she was safe.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.000
Yes, of course.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.800
Well, I'm not sure if I did.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.159
Not sure at all.

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.840
Please try to remember, Mr. Hemelin.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.719
I can't. It's all very unclear in my mind.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.939
If the boat's not here, we'll be stuck on the island forever and ever.

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.240
Well, we pulled it well ashore so it should be okay,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.280
but we'd better check on it as soon as we can.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.280
I'll go have a look.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.439
Quickly, Moment. Be careful.

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:02.840
I remember I was just going to do it when I spotted this flower.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.439
Just by a rocket was, oh dear.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:08.759
Mumin.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.399
Boy, that was close.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Tied to the tree and make sure it's tight. That should do it.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Just in time.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
You know the waves must have been huge to reach this far.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Well, we saved the boat.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Yes.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Well, this storm will be over soon.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Is everything okay? Yep, everything's fine.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Oh, thank goodness! So we're not stranded after all.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Huh? No.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
We needn't have worried.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I'm very sorry, really I am.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Are you alright, Snort Maiden?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Now I am. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I'm going to get you.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I'm going to get you.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I'm going to get you.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I'm going to get you.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I'm going to get you.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I'm going to get you.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I'm going to get you.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I'm going to get you.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I'm going to get you.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I'm going to get you. I settle down for the night. But it's much too dark to see anything.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.199
The fresh air will do me good.

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:56.699
Oh, that's a good idea. I could do with some fresh air myself.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.500
Wait for me. I'll come too.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.500
Let me and Crick are the money!

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.439
There's still there hundreds of them all glowing!

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:06.959
The hadifatners.

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:08.519
They're waiting for us.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.040
The lightning must have recharged them.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.279
Look at them all.

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:24.000
I wonder what they're once snuck in.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Such a heavy storm would have given them lots and lots of energy. Gosh, they're ready for anything.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
They're not coming any closer.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
They seem fairly friendly. Maybe they just want to see what we look like.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
No, I know what they're here for. Well, what's that Snuffkin?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
It's their barometer, Moomin Papa. They know we've got it and they've come to get it back from us.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Yes, I think you're right snuffkin. Mr. Hamilton, I do think you'd better give it back to them.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.759
Do I have to? Yes of course. After all it is there, isn't there a lot of them?

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.600
Look, why don't you take it out to them now?

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:18.519
You know the Burrometer does belong to the Mr. Hamilton.

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:23.519
Oh, dear, dear. Give it to me.

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:24.959
Let me do it, Papa.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Well done, my boy.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
You must be careful, my dear.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Don't worry, Mama.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:08:03.839
A boy isn't he brave. I think this is what you come for.

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:04.839
Here you are.

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:07.000
You can have it back now.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Come on! I'm not going to be able to get out of here. I'm not going to be able to get out of here. I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I'm not going to be able to get out of here. I'm not going to be able to get out of here. They didn't hurt you, did they? Ah! Go away!

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Lover alone!

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Are you alright, Snorgmaiden?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
What did he do to you?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Just a bit of shock, that's all.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
What's that funny smell?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Oh my god, it's your hair!

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
What?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.039
What do you mean?

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:07.840
What's happened to it?

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.759
Oh, no, my hair.

00:09:08.759 --> 00:09:10.600
Mama, mama.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.799
Where's your mirror?

00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:12.679
Oh, mama.

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:15.799
Oh, look at what those wicked, haddy fat nurse have done.

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:21.159
It's here in my handbag somewhere.

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:22.360
Hurry, mama.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.639
I must see what's happened to my hair.

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:27.000
Here you are, dear. Look at me. Hurry, mama. I must see what's happened to my hair. Here you are, dear.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.759
Look at me.

00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:29.759
Look at me.

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:30.759
It's awful.

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:31.759
It's horrible.

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:32.759
It's horrible.

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:33.759
Don't worry.

00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:38.759
We'll put some magic ointment on and it'll come back all lovely and curly.

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:41.559
I don't want nasty curly hair.

00:09:41.559 --> 00:10:07.000
I want my long, beautiful hair like it was before. Good, I hope that's the last we see of them. Oh dear, what's happened to Snort Maiden?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:26.000
My ear, my ear, where's my ear? I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I'm going to get you.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I'm going to get you.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
I'm going to get you.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
I'm going to get you.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I'm going to get you.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
I'm going to get you.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
I'm going to get you.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I'm going to get you.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I'm going to get you.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I'm going to get you. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I'm going to go to the next room.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I'm going to go to the next room. We've got to hurry. My wonder where they're going. Perhaps a saving away to a secret island.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.960
Somewhere very far away from here where they can live happily on their own together.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:12:10.000
I'm not sure if I can find a way to find a way to find a way to find a way to find a way Where are they going? Perhaps they're sailing away to a secret island. Something very far away from here where they can live happily on their own together.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.399
Gosh, enough kids, they're really weird.

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:18.799
Well, it depends on how you look at a woman.

00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:32.500
They probably think we're a bit strange too.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.779
Snuffkin, you're really horrible. You knew I wanted to see them.

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:39.120
Come on, you were fast asleep.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.340
Snoring your head off.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.600
That wasn't me snoring.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.639
That was Mr. Him you lnd.

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:44.519
All right.

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:46.759
If you say so.

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:49.600
Well, I hope that's the last I'll see of them.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.240
Me too.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.960
That's a very pretty scarf, Snort Maiden.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.720
Yes, it is, isn't it?

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.440
Can we go exploring, Mama?

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.440
I don't see why not.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.639
It looks as though it'll be a nice day,

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:04.960
and there'll be lots of exciting things

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.500
washed up by the storm. Oh, it'll be a nice day, and there'll be lots of exciting things washed up by the storm.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.000
Oh, that'll be fun.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Let's look for the other side of the island.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:32.000
What a good idea! I might discover some more plants! Mr. Hamillin, hurry up, sir, or it will be dark before we get there.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Ah, you go on, Momen. I just want to have a better look at these flowers.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Yes, alright.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Very interesting.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Just think. We could find all sorts of things lying on the sand. I hope in secret, sunken treasure.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Well, let's hope it's not sunken anymore.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I expect there'll be lots and lots of treasures from shipwrecks and things like that.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
But I find it before you!

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Oh, no, you won't!

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Look at all this! It's all mine!

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I'm gonna die real quick!

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Man, what's that over there?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
It's quite shallow right here.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Well there must be something you've minute.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Oh, dear, it's empty.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
I think I found something here.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Ugh!

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Little lie, little lie.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
What's the matter?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Come and see these beautiful shells I have!

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
I'm too busy hunting for treasuren to bother with shells!

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Hey, what's this?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Oh, look at this one! I've got a real collection here.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Golly, lovely, and Mama's garden.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Wow, watch that.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
What? I can't find any as nice as yours.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.600
Don't be in such an awful hurry, little my.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.100
Snark maiden!

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.100
Snark maiden!

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.100
Look!

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.100
Look what I found!

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.100
A proper treasure!

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.100
Look!

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.100
Oh!

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:43.100
There's snow inside of it!

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:50.559
I found it in a cave! What is it? What's this? It's a ship.

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:56.679
Tell us, go. You can see for miles with it. I'll give it to Papa. It's better than

00:15:56.679 --> 00:16:05.700
anything I got. Hey everybody, I found something. Come on up and have a look.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.200
I wish I could find something interesting.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.200
Have you found some buried treasure?

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.200
What a big lady. Is she dead?

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.000
It's made of wood snork maiden. It's a figurehead from a ship.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
She's like a queen!

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.320
Ha! She hasn't got any legs though

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.960
Why don't we put her on the front of our boat?

00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:54.879
Nah, it's much too heavy. It must have come from a ship that was wrecked

00:16:55.919 --> 00:16:57.919
And sank and see

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.480
perhaps it did

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.880
And all hands were lost. I want to take it home

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
What would you do with it?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Use it to frighten people away.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Help! Somebody help me please!

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
That's old Mr. Hamlin!

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Gosh, I hope it's not more haddy fadders.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Someone help please!

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.380
We're coming!

00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:38.440
Woman, why do you like this old figurehead so much?

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.400
You're staring at her.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.680
She's not all that special, you know?

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.279
Yes, I know.

00:17:44.279 --> 00:17:47.000
She's not even real. Only made of wood.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Do you like her eyes?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Or is it her hair?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Just because I haven't got any?

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Nearly there just a bit further.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Come on, snuff it for me.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Pull harder, come on.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
You're very heavy, Mr. Hemmulin. Oh, thank you, snuff getting safe my life.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Oh!

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Boy, how'd you end up there, Mr. Hemmulin?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
One minute I was looking for plants the next I'd fall and right into that hole.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.099
I think you'd be safe for collecting stamps, Mr. Hemulin.

00:18:27.099 --> 00:18:30.400
Oh no, it's not here. Where is it?

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.400
Oh, oh, oh.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.400
What is it now?

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.400
Tell me.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.599
Uh-huh.

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:38.299
May the mubulp preserve me.

00:18:38.299 --> 00:18:40.200
Calm down, Mr. Hemulin.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.000
Tell me what's the matter?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.099
My sample box, my sample box.

00:18:44.099 --> 00:18:45.599
Oh my goodness!

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.000
You didn't leave it in the hole, did you?

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.200
Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you! Oh dear!

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.400
All my precious samples, I'm so silly! Oh, Snuffkin!

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.400
Oh...

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:01.799
Oh, Snuffkin, would you mind?

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:04.400
Okay, anything for some peace.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.900
Oh dear boy, you are wonderful.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.599
You shall have one of my rarest plants as a reward.

00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:13.599
And indeed you shall, I shall choose a magnificent one for you.

00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:15.500
Thank you very much, Mr. Hamelon.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.500
Gosh, your one-room movement is...

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.500
Oh, there you are. What have you been up to?

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:28.799
He can't take his eyes off that silly wooden lady. He just dares at her.

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:29.799
Really?

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:34.000
I do not. I just think she has a very beautiful face.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.299
Well, Moomin, now that you're here, I could really do with your help.

00:19:38.299 --> 00:19:40.299
What do you want, Snuffkin?

00:19:40.299 --> 00:19:44.299
Mr. Hemmillen dropped his box of samples down this hole and I'm going to try and get it.

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:48.700
I didn't drop it. I fell in the hole and just forgot it when stuff can pull me out.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.700
You're a bit absent-minded, Mr. Hemmulin.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:56.200
No, I'm not. I can remember every Latin name of every single plant, you know.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.200
Okay, I'll go down, Moomin, but you'll have to help me get back up.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.200
Okay.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.000
I'll help you too. Now be careful.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.720
Can you see it yet, Snuffkin?

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.839
I'm not down at the bottom yet.

00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:09.839
Oh, forgive me.

00:20:09.839 --> 00:20:11.079
I'm sorry.

00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:12.799
I found it.

00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:13.799
Wonderful.

00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:14.799
Tell me.

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:16.839
Are the plants all right?

00:20:16.839 --> 00:20:19.839
You can check them yourself in a minute.

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:20.839
Oh.

00:20:20.839 --> 00:20:27.000
Are you all right, Snuffkin? Wait a minute. I found something else.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Oh, look! There's the boat! It's moment, moment, moment, Papa!

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Hello!

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
It's gold!

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Hello! We've been hunting treasure! Go and get Moomin' Pop-I-Found Gold!

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Boy, oh boy, I wonder how much there is.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Moomin' Pop-I-Wall-No?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Well, I'm not going to get a little bit of a reward.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
I'm not going to get a little bit of a reward.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:13.000
I'm not going to get a little bit of a reward. Well, loom and papa, what should we do with all this beautiful gold?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
It would look lovely in the garden, don't you think?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
With all the shells that the snorkemaiden found,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
they look good in amongst the roses.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
What do you think, Mama?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
I'm sure they will, Papa. I'm sure they will.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Moomin, she's only a stupid, legless doll.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
You can have my bowl full of snorkemaiden.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
No, thanks.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Will I look after it for you?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
I can pretend it's my treasure.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.079
Oh.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.480
And that was the end of their first adventure in the new boat.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.160
Moomin Papa decided that it was much more fun

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.079
to set off without maps and sea charts.

00:22:00.079 --> 00:22:26.000
You never know where you might end up. They're always happy and always at play.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
The movements.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
The movements.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
They love the laughter and they love the living.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:52.000
The movements. The living, the movements Believing and sharing and caring and giving the movements

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
They're always happy and goes at play

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
The movements are having fun day after day

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:12.000
The movements The moment, the moment, the moment.
