1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,320
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come.

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:26,560
Come on and sit down here with me, they're here for you on your TV, they are the movements,

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:34,880
they are the movements, so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement

4
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:44,000
land, you can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:55,520
were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:20,240
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

7
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:50,240
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

8
00:01:50,240 --> 00:02:14,960
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

9
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:41,680
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

10
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:57,120
that's the invisible child, I wonder what she really looks like,

11
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,640
oh well good morning everybody, morning lazy bones, we've been up for hours and hours,

15
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:53,840

16
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,880

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:21,040

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,960

28
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,360
yes

29
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
MMM?

30
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
MMM?

31
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
HMM?

32
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
FHHHHH?!

33
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
MMM?

34
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
HMM?

35
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
HMM?

36
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Got you, Little Mike!

37
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,160
No! I'd like to know where Ninny's hiding!

38
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Oh, look!

39
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Oh!

40
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:05,160
That! Come out, Nanny. I've got you. That was a good place. But I saw your ribbon.

41
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,160
Oh! Now for snorkemaiden. She's always easy to find.

42
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,160
Ha! That's only because she wants to be found!

43
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,160
Found you snorkemaiden!

44
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Waaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn,

45
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:34,160
Two, three, don't wait, nanny, this is my boy.

46
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Four.

47
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Hey, nanny, I'll show you a good place.

48
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Just come with your uncle stinky.

49
00:07:52,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Now don't worry, no one will find you there, it opens up once you're inside.

50
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Come on, it's a bit steep, I'll help you.

51
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Oh, stop!

52
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Right, that should keep you quiet.

53
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
You're a bit too visible at the moment.

54
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
Oh, let me out.

55
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,160
But I'm sure if you stay here until tomorrow, no one will see it all.

56
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Please don't leave me here, please.

57
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
No, it's...

58
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,160
That's it, now tomorrow we'll hit the bank.

59
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Let me out.

60
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Please let me out.

61
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,160
I'm very glad I thought of bringing nanny here.

62
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,160
It's nice to have her here too, Tiki.

63
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
She's no trouble at all.

64
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,160
You're all pretty eccentric, and it might be just what she needs to make her want to be seen again.

65
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,160
Oh, and you're very kind, of course.

66
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Well, thank you, I think I suppose we should be flattered, shouldn't we?

67
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Oh, yes, definitely.

68
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,160
She started to talk, but her voice is very weak.

69
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
You have to listen very carefully.

70
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Has it always been like that, or just since she was invisible?

71
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,160
I'm not sure, I don't think it was like that before.

72
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,160
Lots of people manage very well without using their heads, so I'm certain nanny will be all right.

73
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,160
Yes, and I'm glad she's got movement in the others to play with.

74
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,160
She's never had anybody before, you know.

75
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,160
I think she'd find it a bit difficult to Tiki.

76
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Well, Mum and Mama, I think that all she needs is something to shock her out of it.

77
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
Huh, got you a little, my.

78
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Oh, that bush was too prickly anyway.

79
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
I expect I'm the last one, hey.

80
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
No, I haven't found nanny yet.

81
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Nanny?

82
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
I didn't think nanny would hide so well.

83
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Any luck, Sniff?

84
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
There's nowhere else to look, Mum and.

85
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,160
Perhaps she's lost or fallen or hurt herself.

86
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,160
I've looked absolutely everywhere.

87
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
I bet she's invisible again.

88
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
That's why I can't find her.

89
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
I bet Sniff hasn't looked everywhere.

90
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
She can't be far.

91
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Do you know where she is, Mum?

92
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
No, I haven't seen her at all.

93
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Not since we started.

94
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Nanny!

95
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
Come on, we're going home.

96
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
We've finished playing.

97
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Nanny!

98
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,160
Oh, my goodness, where could she be?

99
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Nanny!

100
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
It's your turn, Sniff, so you've got to find her.

101
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
Nanny!

102
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,160
Not once the game's over, I haven't.

103
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Never mind.

104
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
We'll all look.

105
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
We must find her.

106
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,160
We are supposed to be looking after her, you know?

107
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Oh, come on, Nanny!

108
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,160
The game's over, we've finished!

109
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Nanny!

110
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Nanny!

111
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
Nanny!

112
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Hurry up!

113
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
We're going home for cookies and lemonade!

114
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Nanny!

115
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Nanny!

116
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Nanny!

117
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
Nanny!

118
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Nanny!

119
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Can you hear us?

120
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,160
We weren't supposed to come this far, Snort Maiden.

121
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,160
She might be really lost or frightened or anything.

122
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Nanny!

123
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Where are you, Nanny?

124
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
Can you hear me?

125
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Nanny!

126
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Help!

127
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
I'm over here!

128
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,160
Did you hear something?

129
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,160
I'm not sure.

130
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Help!

131
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Help!

132
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
I'm here!

133
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
Help!

134
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
That's her!

135
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
She's not far away!

136
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Nanny!

137
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Where are you?

138
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Here!

139
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
Behind this rock!

140
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
Where's her voice coming from?

141
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
That way, I think.

142
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Nanny!

143
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,160
I can't hear what you're saying!

144
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Try and shout a bit louder!

145
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
I'm over here!

146
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Over here!

147
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Behind the rock!

148
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
I still can't hear her properly!

149
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Louder, Nanny!

150
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
Louder!

151
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
Behind the rock!

152
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
Which rock?

153
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
Over here!

154
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
The big rock!

155
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,160
Over there!

156
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,160
I've never shouted so much in my life!

157
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,160
Nanny!

158
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Nanny, are you behind this rock, Nanny?

159
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Yes!

160
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,160
Stinky block the cave with it!

161
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,160
Don't worry, we'll get you out!

162
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Hang on!

163
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,160
Are you alright, Nanny?

164
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Thank you, Mum!

165
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Oh, thank you!

166
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Your voice seems to be...

167
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Oh, what?

168
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
Oh, nothing!

169
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Try and hold on to me, and I'll call you out!

170
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Oh, thank you!

171
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
Hey!

172
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
What's happened?

173
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Where's your finder?

174
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
In the cave!

175
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
Wow!

176
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,160
What a brilliant hiding place had you find it!

177
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
What's wrong?

178
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
Did I say something funny?

179
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Now, that was very mean of Stinky's.

180
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,160
A clever idea, though, of interuser for a van robbery.

181
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Oh, Papa!

182
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Oh, I know Stinky shouldn't have done it,

183
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,160
and it must have been a nasty shopping trapped in the dark in that cave,

184
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,160
but no real harm came to her, and she didn't disappear,

185
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
and her voice got much stronger.

186
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
You're so loud!

187
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Oh, goodness! Did you, dear?

188
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
Yes, Mum and Mama!

189
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Mum told me to yell loudly, so he'd know where I was!

190
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
And it was loud, too!

191
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Good for you, Nanny.

192
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
It's surprising the things you can do if you have to,

193
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,160
and you ought to remember that people who speak loudly are usually very noticeable.

194
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
Go on, yo! I want to see it!

195
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
That's a good idea, Nanny.

196
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
If shouting brought back your voice,

197
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
you never know it might be just what's needed to make the rest of you.

198
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
Try and get angry, as well.

199
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Yeah, that's easy. Just think about Stinky.

200
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
Yeah, and how horrible he is!

201
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,160
That should make you angry. Very angry!

202
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
Just your white Stinky!

203
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
I can't help faster than me!

204
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Stinky, wait! We want to talk to you!

205
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
I don't want to talk to you!

206
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Help! Help!

207
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Are you all right, Sniff?

208
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
You can't get away, Stinky.

209
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,160
The forest is my home ground! You won't catch me in here!

210
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Hold it.

211
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
You can't do this to me!

212
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
We're only doing what you did to Nanny.

213
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Now look, I needed her to help me. I did, I tell ya.

214
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,160
But she didn't want to, huh?

215
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,160
That's why I put her down this hole to change her mind.

216
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,160
And scare her so much that she'd become totally invisible again.

217
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,160
She had to be invisible for my plan. Now get me out of here!

218
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,160
It's all right, Stinky. See you tomorrow!

219
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
No! No!

220
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,160
You crushed few things!

221
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,160
I had such a wonderful plan!

222
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,160
Ah, you're spiteful!

223
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Let's hear them my next job!

224
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,160
But despite all that had happened, Nanny's face was still not to be seen.

225
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,160
Then, about ten days later.

226
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,160
This weather seems to push the nails out.

227
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,160
I haven't seen anyone stare at the sea like Nanny does.

228
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Well, maybe she's never seen it before.

229
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Oh, she's crying now!

230
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
What's the matter?

231
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,160
It's the sea! It's far too big!

232
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,160
You don't have to go on it, you know.

233
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Mama! Mama! What's up?

234
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
What's the matter with her?

235
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Nothing to worry about. She's never seen the sea before and she's just surprised at how big it is.

236
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Well, there's an awful lot of water, that's for sure.

237
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,160
Nanny's lucky. I wish there was something to surprise or excite me.

238
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Nothing's happened for weeks. Anything would be nice.

239
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Mama must be bored.

240
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
I think you're right.

241
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
But she never gets bored.

242
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,160
Well, she is now. She needs something to happen.

243
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,160
I think we should do something to surprise her.

244
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Like what?

245
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Well, I know what we can do.

246
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
Well, tell me!

247
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,160
We'll creep up behind her and just give her a little push.

248
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
What, Papa? Push her into the sea?

249
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Oh, Papa, you can't. Mama wouldn't like it.

250
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Just watch me.

251
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,160
But the water's freezing. A mama will get all wet.

252
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,160
We never found the water too cold when we were your age.

253
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
You young people today have no sense of fun.

254
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,160
Did you really used to do things like that?

255
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,160
All the time.

256
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Papa?

257
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Yes, Mumann.

258
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
Oh, nothing.

259
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Don't worry, Mumann.

260
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,160
It's always a prank. She'll find it very funny. I promise.

261
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Oh.

262
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,160
I know you don't!

263
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
No!

264
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,160
Don't you dare push her into that big horrible sea.

265
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,160
Let me explain to you.

266
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
There's nothing to explain.

267
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,160
You're a big bully. She'd have gone all wet.

268
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,160
What a nasty trick.

269
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,160
You could never...

270
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Nihini.

271
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,160
There's her face! Hurry!

272
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,160
That must be the sea.

273
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,160
What on earth happened? Were you up to something?

274
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Oh, nothing much. You know that child has got the sharpest teeth with her without her head.

275
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,160
Oh, Mumann. Mumann, at last I'm visible again.

276
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
For always you won't disappear again.

277
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
Never, never.

278
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Brave girl.

279
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,160
And with a good strong set of healthy teeth too.

280
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Oh, I'm so happy, Nihini.

281
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Mimi dear.

282
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Mumann mother.

283
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
I'm very glad too.

284
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Oh.

285
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Oh.

286
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
Oh.

287
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Oh.

288
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Oh.

289
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
Oh, you.

290
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Stop laughing, you horrible child. You used Sartuth monster.

291
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,160
What's so funny, huh?

292
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Oh.

293
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
Really, Nihini laughed.

294
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,160
Well, she certainly changed, Mumann, Mama.

295
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,160
All she needed was to get angry and she did.

296
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,160
I hope Mumann Papa's forgiven, Nihini.

297
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,160
Thank you all for taking such good care of her.

298
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,160
I hate to say it, but she sounds almost as bad as it'll mine out.

299
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Tiki! Nihini!

300
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,160
And so Nihini left Mumann house with Tiki.

301
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,160
Now that she was completely visible and far from Timid,

302
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
she was ready for anything.

303
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,160
That is except seeing her aunt, she said.

304
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,160
Boom!

305
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Boom!

306
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:13,160
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

307
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

308
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,160
They're always happy and always at play.

309
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,160
The movements are having fun day after day.

310
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,160
The movements.

311
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,160
The movements.

312
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:42,160
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

313
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

314
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,160
They're always happy and always at play.

315
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,160
The movements are having fun day after day.

316
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,160
The movements.

317
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,160
The movements.

318
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:11,160
The movements.
