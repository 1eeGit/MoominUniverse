371840	401840	Ah, Mr. Hebblin, I know, woman, papa, you'd like me to do the fireworks. It looks like we're throwing a party. We'll have lots of pretty flowers. Just tell me what you want, mama, and we'll do it.
401840	408840	It's great, those kids will just love it. If they survive, women.
408840	429840	Now then, children, the women are all a little bit odd, so behave properly. Yes, mother, we will. They'll be here soon. Take this in, woman. Okay.
430840	441840	The joke works really well. Oh, good. I must try it. Mmm, these look nice. Oh, stiff. Leave them alone, will you? Oh, all right. Just this one.
445840	453840	Huh? They're here. Come on, everybody. They'll soon be at the door. Right. Come on, children. Help me with the flowers.
453840	462840	Oh, dear. Fireworks now are later on. Oh, later on, I think. You're very old, finally.
468840	479840	Welcome to Moomin House, Mrs. Philly John. It was very kind of you to invite us, Moomin, mama. Come in, please, and make yourselves at home. Oh, thank you all very much indeed.
484840	496840	Welcome to Moomin Valley. Oh, all in my hair. It looks very untidy, doesn't it, mother?
496840	510840	It's a surprise. They should have been rose buds, but we couldn't find any at all. Oh, yes. Dear, what a mess. Mrs. Philly John, let me introduce the children. They all look different.
510840	524840	Well, yes. Only Moomin is really ours. The others are sort of... I'm sure they'll all get on. Oh, I'm afraid my children do not play. They would much rather read or study.
524840	538840	Oh, are you sure they've got to have some time for play? I'm sure. Well, come into the dining room anyway. You can watch the others playing.
539840	543840	Make sure the chairs are clean. Yes, mother, we will.
546840	550840	Won't you let them play at all? No, I will not.
555840	559840	Come on, everybody. Wouldn't you like to have a go on our slide? No.
560840	569840	Hmm. You'd really enjoy it once you got going. I know you would. No, thank you. No, no, not at all. No, definitely not.
570840	579840	And you're really quite sure, are you? Yes. I thought so. Then we've got it all to ourselves.
582840	584840	Yahoo!
590840	594840	Moomin sounds like he's having fun.
604840	610840	Oh, and that's a little Mayan sniff. Your children seem very quiet, Mrs. Philly John.
610840	616840	Good children are seen and not heard, my dear.
617840	621840	That was one of mine. Yippee!
621840	623840	And that was another.
623840	629840	Well, it sounds like they're having fun for once. I have a biscuit, Mrs. Philly John. They have an unusual taste.
629840	632840	I'd run out of flowers, so I used them.
635840	638840	Don't worry. Moomin will look after them.
641840	644840	Go on, it's your turn now.
649840	651840	Oh, my children.
658840	661840	Stop it. It's too dangerous. You might hurt yourself.
662840	664840	No!
667840	669840	Oh, come on. Stop it at once.
669840	674840	Now, don't you worry, Mrs. Philly John. I've got ointment in my bag if I hurt themselves.
674840	676840	Thank you, dear mother.
683840	687840	Stop children. You hear me. We're going home now. Stop it.
688840	690840	Oh, this is great.
693840	698840	I think it's time for the glorious finale, Papa.
699840	701840	I can't say I wasn't warned.
704840	710840	Exposing them to this, Moomin Valley is no place for proper children. No place at all.
711840	713840	Oh, dear, what's this?
713840	716840	Their fireworks in your honor.
716840	717840	Fireworks.
718840	721840	I made them especially to welcome you.
734840	736840	Goodbye. Come back soon.
736840	738840	Yeah, welcome to power.
738840	739840	No, you will not.
741840	743840	I don't think Mrs. Philly John can join her party.
743840	745840	She's very lucky that I didn't bite her.
747840	751840	She should have had a go on the slide. I'm sure she would have loved it.
751840	753840	And then she wouldn't have shouted at her children.
753840	757840	Donuts don't slide down, shoot sniff. They're too afraid of looking silly.
758840	759840	Whoa!
760840	761840	Oh, oh.
762840	763840	Papa.
763840	768840	Oh, I'm very sorry, Moomin, but don't worry, I'll fix it. It is nothing much broken.
768840	770840	What happened, my dear?
770840	775840	No, I thought it had been such a long time since I'd been on the slide that I'd have a go.
777840	780840	I didn't think I'd be too heavy for it. I know.
780840	784840	When we mend it, why don't we make it strong enough for me and Mama to play on as well?
784840	786840	I think she'd like that.
787840	790840	That's a good idea, Papa. But we want to use it too.
791840	795840	Well, that's a course. I just try it out. Now and again.
801840	804840	I want you to stay here while I'm out.
804840	806840	What if somebody asks us to play?
806840	807840	What do you mean?
807840	809840	Play.
810840	813840	I hope you're not thinking of the Moomin's, are you?
813840	818840	I don't want you mixing with those noisy children ever again, do you hear me?
818840	820840	Where are you going, mother?
820840	825840	To look for another house. It was a terrible mistake coming to Moomin Valley.
825840	830840	Look, there's Mrs. Philly junk. Good afternoon.
830840	832840	Please stay away from my children.
832840	837840	Oh, but why? We thought they might like to come and have an adventure with us.
837840	840840	Oh, never mind. Let's go.
843840	845840	I'm going to go.
845840	847840	I'm going to go.
847840	849840	I'm going to go.
849840	851840	I'm going to go.
851840	854840	I'm going to go.
860840	863840	Hey, hang on a minute.
874840	877840	Oh, you're Tarsam.
882840	884840	Oh, no!
890840	892840	I like it.
892840	895840	It's too late for you now, Sniff.
895840	899840	Oh, no, not the Humpty crocodile at the bottom of the Gorge.
899840	901840	We should have brought the Philly junks with us.
901840	903840	But Moomin messes Philly junks.
903840	905840	We need to look tall, her.
905840	908840	Have you been killed and eaten yet, Sniff?
908840	914840	No, I fell on top of the crocodile and knocked him out and then swam me shore.
914840	917840	Sniff, but I thought you couldn't swim.
917840	920840	On your own business.
920840	924840	Hey, that looks like the Philly junks.
928840	930840	Why don't they come over here?
930840	933840	I bet their mother told them not to talk to us.
933840	935840	See if I care you.
939840	941840	Hey, what are you doing?
941840	944840	Why aren't you playing with Moomin and the others?
944840	947840	I don't think they want to play with us.
947840	950840	They didn't call for us when they went past.
950840	953840	Stinky's arrived and wonder what he's doing here.
953840	956840	I bet you it's no fun stuck in that garden.
956840	959840	No, we'd rather be out here playing.
959840	962840	Well, I know somewhere much better than Moomin's.
962840	964840	It's a great place to play.
964840	965840	Do you?
965840	967840	Yes, would I lie to you?
967840	971840	It's a bit of a way off, but it'll be really exciting and lots of fun so do you want to come or not.
971840	973840	Well, it is a bit boring here.
973840	975840	Yes, very.
975840	978840	Do you really think they don't want to play with us?
978840	980840	Doesn't look like it.
980840	984840	Your brother's absolutely right, so come on if you're coming because I can't wait.
984840	986840	What's stinky up to?
986840	988840	I don't trust you.
988840	996840	Don't worry.
996840	998840	Oh, oh, oh.
998840	999840	Oh, oh.
999840	1005840	Oh, oh.
1005840	1009840	Oh, oh.
1009840	1014840	Okay, now this is the place I told you about good, isn't it?

1022360	1024920	that's great i've never been anywhere like this
1027240	1034520	a bit frightening without the thrill where's the fun you need a bit of danger to spice it up
1034520	1037640	gee willikers it looks like the other side is higher than this side
1038760	1044280	yes it's all right you just have to put your legs up that's all who wants to go first
1045640	1052280	i've got it why don't you all go together what the three of us see this way it won't feel so
