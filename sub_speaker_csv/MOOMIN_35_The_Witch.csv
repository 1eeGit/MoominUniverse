1074160,1076160,"Of course.",1073800,1075000,"SPEAKER_04"
1076160,1079160,"Oh, I'm sorry. I was a bit taken aback.",1075000,1083000,"SPEAKER_03"
1079160,1082160,"You don't mind about your grandmother being a real witch?",1075000,1083000,"SPEAKER_03"
1082160,1083160,"Oh, no.",1075000,1083000,"SPEAKER_03"
1083160,1086160,"That's what she is. I was husband.",1083000,1083400,"SPEAKER_16"
1086160,1088160,"I'm going to be one, too, when I'm grown up.",1083600,1088600,"SPEAKER_16"
1088160,1090160,"Oh, no. You couldn't.",1083600,1088600,"SPEAKER_16"
1090160,1092160,"Well, you don't look anything like one.",1089100,1092600,"SPEAKER_16"
1092160,1094160,"Well, that's because I'm not one yet.",1089100,1092600,"SPEAKER_16"
1094160,1097160,"When you're born into a witch family, that's what you become.",1093200,1101300,"SPEAKER_16"
1097160,1099160,"But it's not that easy, you know.",1093200,1101300,"SPEAKER_16"
1099160,1101160,"Oh, this is too much.",1093200,1101300,"SPEAKER_16"
1102160,1105160,"Now, tell me, what are you doing here in the forest of witches?",1093200,1101300,"SPEAKER_16"
1105160,1107160,"You don't sound like a witch.",1102600,1106000,"SPEAKER_16"
1107160,1110160,"Oh, really? What do witches sound like?",1106000,1107500,"SPEAKER_09"
1110160,1113160,"Well, to be honest, you're the first one I've ever met in my whole life.",1107800,1110100,"SPEAKER_16"
1113160,1116160,"I'm sure that's just what you think, young man.",1110300,1113500,"SPEAKER_09"
1116160,1119160,"Is it true that the nice girl is really your granddaughter?",1113900,1114700,"SPEAKER_09"
1119160,1122160,"Certainly. A very promising young girl.",1116500,1119300,"SPEAKER_09"
1122160,1126160,"Honest and hardworking, and with a lot of training, she will make an excellent witch someday.",1120700,1122100,"SPEAKER_16"
1126160,1129160,"But how can you possibly turn such a sweet girl into a witch?",1122600,1126700,"SPEAKER_16"
1130160,1132160,"The sweetest girls make the best witches.",1130100,1130100,"SPEAKER_09"
1130160,1132160,"The sweetest girls make the best witches.",1130100,1131800,"SPEAKER_16"
1132160,1134160,"Hello, didn't know you were back, Grandma.",1131800,1132400,"SPEAKER_09"
1134160,1137160,"Thank you for getting the water, Alicia.",1132500,1136700,"SPEAKER_16"
1137160,1139160,"Oh, who's that?",1132500,1136700,"SPEAKER_16"
1139160,1143160,"I don't know. Some naive young man ought to rescue a damsel in distress now.",1139000,1143500,"SPEAKER_16"
1143160,1146160,"I remember you, your snuffkin.",1139000,1143500,"SPEAKER_16"
1146160,1147160,"Yes.",1144100,1146300,"SPEAKER_16"
1150160,1153160,"Your friend snuffkins in here, why don't you come in, too?",1150100,1160400,"SPEAKER_16"
1153160,1154160,"In the house?",1150100,1160400,"SPEAKER_16"
1154160,1155160,"Really?",1150100,1160400,"SPEAKER_16"
1155160,1157160,"He's brought friends with him, has he?",1150100,1160400,"SPEAKER_16"
1157160,1160160,"Suffkin, whatever they're done to you.",1150100,1160400,"SPEAKER_16"
1160160,1162160,"I'll take care of that.",1150100,1160400,"SPEAKER_16"
1162160,1164160,"Wait a second, I'll do it for you.",1160900,1164700,"SPEAKER_16"
1164160,1166160,"I'll fix it.",1160900,1164700,"SPEAKER_16"
1171160,1173160,"Wait, I'm gonna need you again.",1169800,1174700,"SPEAKER_16"
1173160,1175160,"Where are you going?",1171200,1171500,"SPEAKER_00"
1175160,1178160,"I don't think that snake ever got bitten before.",1173600,1174500,"SPEAKER_10"
1178160,1179160,"I'll get another.",1175400,1179100,"SPEAKER_16"
1179160,1182160,"I'm very curious, why are you three here, huh?",1175400,1179100,"SPEAKER_16"
1182160,1186160,"They came all the way from Moomin Valley because they were really worried about me, Grandma.",1179700,1182400,"SPEAKER_16"
1187160,1188160,"What about you?",1182900,1193400,"SPEAKER_16"
1188160,1194160,"Yes, they thought you might be nasty to me, so they came all this way to see if I needed help.",1182900,1193400,"SPEAKER_16"
1194160,1196160,"This always happens.",1182900,1193400,"SPEAKER_16"
1196160,1201160,"People treat witches as if they weren't ordinary, respectable, responsible citizens.",1194600,1194900,"SPEAKER_03"
1201160,1203160,"No, no, we're very sorry.",1201100,1210000,"SPEAKER_03"
1203160,1210160,"We realize she's quite okay and she's most welcome to visit us in Moomin Valley at any time, isn't she snuffkin?",1201100,1210000,"SPEAKER_03"
1210160,1212160,"Yes, certainly.",1210000,1211000,"SPEAKER_09"
1212160,1215160,"What? You said you'd visit these people?",1210000,1211000,"SPEAKER_09"
1215160,1220160,"Yes, I thought I'd go over there sometimes after I finished with my homework, of course.",1213200,1222300,"SPEAKER_16"
1220160,1222160,"I would never leave my studies half done.",1213200,1222300,"SPEAKER_16"
1222160,1228160,"Sorry, Alicia, but if you ever want to become a good witch, you mustn't see any ordinary mortals.",1213200,1222300,"SPEAKER_16"
1228160,1233160,"Oh, why not? I've only just become friends with them, Grandma, please.",1222300,1237400,"SPEAKER_16"
1233160,1238160,"I know. Why don't I wait a year and study to be a witch next year?",1222300,1237400,"SPEAKER_16"
1238160,1240160,"Alicia.",1238100,1239000,"SPEAKER_16"
1241160,1247160,"This is family business, so if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you were to leave.",1238100,1239000,"SPEAKER_16"
1247160,1251160,"And I'd like you to go immediately if you'd please.",1242500,1247100,"SPEAKER_16"
1261160,1264160,"It's snowing.",1247600,1250500,"SPEAKER_16"
1264160,1271160,"While she certainly won't be able to visit us at Moomin Valley is buried in snow, so we might never see her again.",1262000,1263100,"SPEAKER_03"
1271160,1276160,"No, that's right, and you'll be leaving soon, won't you snuffkin?",1264800,1270400,"SPEAKER_09"
1276160,1281160,"Winter had come once again to Moomin Valley.",1273300,1275600,"SPEAKER_02"
1281160,1284160,"It's snowing.",1279300,1280200,"SPEAKER_00"
1311160,1318160,"The Moons are having fun day after day, the Moons.",1307600,1311600,"SPEAKER_07"
1318160,1321160,"The Moons.",1311700,1317700,"SPEAKER_08"
1321160,1328160,"The Moons.",1318300,1321000,"SPEAKER_08"
