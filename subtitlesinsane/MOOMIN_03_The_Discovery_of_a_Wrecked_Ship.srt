1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Therefore you are on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
They are the movements. I'll take you up to a moment land. You can fly just like a bird.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Sing that song ever.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There were the moments.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There were the moments.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There were the moments.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There were the moments.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There were the moments. There was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement, there was a movement Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba The sun is shining and movement valleys enjoying its usual peace and tranquility.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Wait a minute. Who's this?

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Wait for me, movement!

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Mama! Mama! Are they ready?

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Are what ready?

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
The pancakes!

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,199
Not yet. This hobgoblin wood doesn't seem to burn very well.

19
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,699
Aren't they cooking?

20
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,199
They won't be long. Have some lemonade while you're waiting.

21
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,400
Mama! Are the pancakes ready yet?

22
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh well. Everything seems normal in the movement house.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,500
Oh!

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm a dumb boy. I'm a no-good-meagaboo mini.

25
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,000
No, you're not, Snork. You're very clever.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No, I'm a failure of floppy frightful fraud and a misfit.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But your land ship was a success? Wasn't it?

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Kid stuff!

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Look, if you can make a ship that runs on land,

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
then I'm sure you can make one that flies, I believe in you.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Fatal out of good, that does me snort and maiden.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,159
You know, last night I thought I'd done it, a flagship,

33
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,759
then I looked at it again.

34
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,280
No good, no good.

35
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,439
It was all wrong.

36
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,719
Wouldn't, couldn't fly at all.

37
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:03,199
Or how could someone so intelligent be such an idiot?

38
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,039
Oh dear, oh dear.

39
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,699
Well, they're ready.

40
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,580
Go and tell the others little Mai.

41
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,659
All right, Moomin, Mama.

42
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:16,020
Where's Moomin and Snork Maiden?

43
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,699
Snork Maiden's fallen again.

44
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,819
Come on, Snork Maiden, cheer up.

45
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,580
I'm sure Snork will get over it.

46
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,719
Inventors always feel down in the dumps when something doesn't work.

47
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,719
Does Moomin Papa do you think?

48
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,479
He invents stories, doesn't he, Moomin?

49
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,199
Well, where Moomin was really?

50
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,840
Snork Maiden, do you want some pancakes?

51
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,199
Oh, yes, please, Moomin Mama.

52
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,000
Moomin, go and get Papa.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,800
I have a feeling he's writing his gut stuck again.

54
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,000
OK, Mama.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now, what's the matter, Snork Maiden?

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The sun returned to the eastern sky when morning came

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and everything started to get lighter and louder.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Dear, everybody knows that, even the stupidest retard, really.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I have absolutely no literary talent. I'm an ignorant, Miss Son a literate, dilettant, nor an illiterate idiot.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's high time I gave up writing, though.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes?

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Papa?

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What is it, moment?

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Uh, Mama said to tell you the pancakes are ready.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Well, I can't stop now.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm being creative.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll eat later.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,500
Oh, really? Yes. Anything else? Uh, Mama said to tell you the pancakes are ready. Well, I can't stop now. I'm being creative. I'll eat later.

69
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh, really?

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes, anything else?

71
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Yeah. No. I thought you said something.

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,000
Mom in! Wait. I'm going out.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm coming!

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No, you can't.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Snuffkin and I are going on an adventure, and it could be dangerous.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hi, Snuffkin!

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hello, Moome.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Hello, Moome.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Hello, Moome.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hello, Moome.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,240
Hello, Moome. Hello, Moome. Hello, Moome. Hello, Moome. Hello, Moome. and it could be dangerous.

82
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,199
Nice, Nuffkin!

83
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,000
Hello, Moomin. Didn't think you were coming. Sorry, I'm late. What's that?

84
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,079
A leaf boat. Look, it sails on the river just like a real one.

85
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,680
I bet it goes all the way down to the sea,

86
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,800
and maybe even to some foreign lands.

87
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,519
Gosh, Nuffkin, I'd like to do that one day.

88
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,279
Let's go then, shall we?

89
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,920
Little my wanted to come, but I told her it was too dangerous.

90
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,040
Hmm, perhaps that wasn't the best thing to say.

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Look!

92
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Where are you?

93
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Where are you?

94
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
I brought these two of them on.

95
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,040
I thought they could use a bit of fun.

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,000
Wait, woman!

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Are we really gonna climb up there?

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Look, I don't think we can all go. It'll just be moving in me.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm not climbing up there. Well, I am.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Wouldn't you like to keep me company instead?

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,100
Look, there's a cave just a little bit further along this path.

102
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,399
Why don't you two girls wait for a sec? We won't be long.

103
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,899
But if you can walk to it, why on earth climb to it?

104
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,300
Ah, difficult for a girl to understand.

105
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,300
Well, I think boys are difficult to understand.

106
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,300
We're not sure we can reach it from above.

107
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Well, we'll soon find out.

108
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,439
Are you coming with us, Sniff? Oh, I think I'll guard the rear. Protect the it from above. Well, we'll soon find out. Are you coming with us, Sniff?

109
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,639
Oh, I think I'll guard the rear.

110
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,720
Protect the cave from below.

111
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,240
Oh, yeah.

112
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, someone has to look after the girls.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:07:01,800
Someone responsible. Oh my goodness, it's dark in there. Let's go in then. I don't like the look of it.

114
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,519
We'd better stay out here. You never know who might live in there.

115
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,600
Don't be silly.

116
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,319
No one lives in there.

117
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,600
That's what I don't like.

118
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,920
Yes, exactly a place with no one living in it is really scary.

119
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,480
I think we must be right above the cave here.

120
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,439
Maybe.

121
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,360
I can't find a hole, though.

122
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's look a bit more over that way moving

123
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,920
Wow, I never seen a shell like this before

124
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,120
Look at that one they must be worth a fortune come over here and look little mind

125
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:46,060
Where's little my eyes Nork made and she went into the Sniff. Oh, no, she can't do that.

126
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,300
It might be dangerous.

127
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:53,699
Little my, little my, come out.

128
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,100
No, you come in, scaredy cat.

129
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,860
You can't just go in like that.

130
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,300
You can't.

131
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,899
So tell me, how would you go in then, Mr. No, at all?

132
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,259
Stay where you are.

133
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:05,699
We'll rescue you.

134
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,000
Uh, you're coming too, aren't you, Snork Maiden?

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You can't stay here alone.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,800
I suppose so.

137
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,300
Right then, let's go.

138
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,800
Uh, shall I hold your hand in case you get frightened?

139
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,199
Little Mai! Where are you?

140
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:46,000
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Stop it, please! You're frightening Snork Maiden! Little Miiiight! Where are you? I can hear something. Me too. Perhaps it's the wind.

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No, Snork Maiden. It sounds like someone moaning.

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You get scared me like that. No one lives here.

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Who want to live here anyway? It's dark and cold.

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's moment and snuffkin.

145
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They've climbed out and we can hear their voices in the distance.

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So we needn't worry. Why would they be moaning?

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,500
No, it's not them.

148
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,600
I'm gonna go and investigate.

149
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,100
Don't little like, please, please stop it.

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Pull hard, Moomin. Will this do?

151
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Right, who's going first?

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Me.

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay, but please be careful.

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I will. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Newman? Yes, of course! Ooh!

155
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Ah!

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Ah!

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Ah!

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Ah!

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Ah!

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Ah!

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Ah!

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Ah!

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Ah!

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Ah!

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Ah!

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Help!

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Help me!

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Moment! What's happened? Talk to me!

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Moment! Are you alright?

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh, I don't know. I think so. My bottom's a little bit sore though.

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm sure I heard somebody scream just now.

172
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Well, the Himmulin was down here having a nap.

173
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,960
The Himmulin? If this is another of your games, woman, I don't like it.

174
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,320
Mr. Himmulan, we were climbing down from the top.

175
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,840
We didn't know you were asleep.

176
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,000
That's not quite right.

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,120
I wasn't asleep.

178
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,200
I wasn't at all comfortable, you know.

179
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,360
Well, what were you doing here then?

180
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,840
Well, to tell you the truth,

181
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,360
I really haven't been quite myself lately.

182
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,960
You haven't lost any more rare stamps, have you, Mr. Himmulan?

183
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:11,000
Unaccontrary, Roman. I have them all. Even the rarest, every single one.

184
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Then what's wrong? That's good, isn't it? I mean, my collection is complete.

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And no one in the world has a better stamp collection than you have, Mr. Himulin?

186
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No, of course not mine is perfect.

187
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,919
There isn't a stamp I haven't got.

188
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,799
Rare ones, old ones, misprinted ones, I have them all.

189
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,399
I still don't understand.

190
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,200
There's no challenge, nothing to search for.

191
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,799
You're too young and you don't collect stamps.

192
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,799
Oh dear, me, dear me.

193
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm beginning to understand.

194
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
Hmm?

195
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,000
He's not a collector anymore.

196
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He's got all the stamps he could ever want.

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's the trouble.

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's not half as much fun.

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's why you're sad, isn't it, Mr. Hemmungen?

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes, it is. No fun.

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No fun at all.

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Now I understand.

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can see why you're upset.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And me falling on top of you like that didn't really help, did it?

205
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Not exactly, Moomin.

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Look who was taking a nap in the cave.

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Oh, it's you, Mr. Amulin.

208
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So it must have been his snoring that we heard.

209
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What a noise he was making.

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'd never ever snore.

211
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You certainly do! Yeah, always! Sit it! Sit it!

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Sit it!

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Sit it!

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Sit it!

215
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Sit it!

216
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Sit it!

217
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Sit it!

218
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Sit it!

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Sit it!

220
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Sit it!

221
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,960
Sit it! Sit it! But you know you can't always tell. The keel doesn't look too good. Yes, we could take it out to see a no-time. The sales got holes in it.

222
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,639
Hey, I can't find any owners.

223
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,399
You can paddle all-steer.

224
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,240
Look out, friends. It's going over!

225
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Hey!

226
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Hang on, everybody.

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I've lost my confidence and it makes me feel very unhappy. Well, it can happen to anyone, you know.

228
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Even to you?

229
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, not much, of course.

230
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Lucky you. I just don't know what to do.

231
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,539
How can I get it back? There must be a way.

232
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:53,299
It's hard to say. Everybody's different, but with me it just happens.

233
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:00,340
I don't think I'll ever invent anything again.

234
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,779
Perhaps I'll have a break from my memoirs too.

235
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Tea time? Oh dear, what's the matter with you, Choo?

236
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You look a bit down in the dumps.

237
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You know I might have been a bit overconfident.

238
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Me too, I think.

239
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh.

240
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, hey there!

241
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Mum and mama!

242
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Mum and papa!

243
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
There's no need to yell. We can hear you, watch the matter sniff.

244
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
We found a boat on the beach, come and have a look!

245
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
A shipwreck washed up on the shore.

246
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's not a wreck and it's got a white sail.

247
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh-ho.

248
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We're gonna repair it and then it'll be ours.

249
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
All right, I'm coming.

250
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Come on, snork, let's take a look at this boat.

251
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,039
It could be just the thing that cheer us both up.

252
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,879
So it's got a sail.

253
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:51,679
A white sail, you say.

254
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,320
That could be extremely interesting.

255
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,120
It's a sturdy little craft.

256
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,440
It's nicely built.

257
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,200
Well designed.

258
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,279
She's a bounding.

259
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,000
So does that mean we can keep her?

260
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It seems to be in pretty good condition except for the hole in the bottom.

261
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You know, maybe that's why she was abandoned here.

262
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You could be right, Southkin.

263
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Finder's keepers, you guys. Of course it makes it our boat.

264
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,840
It'd have to wait to see if anyone claims it first little mine. What shall we do then Papa?

265
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:35,000
Well first things first we must prepare the hole and then tire up securely in case there's a storm

266
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:41,600
Absolutely then if the owner comes we are to give her back to him

267
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,200
Mind you might know she's here.

268
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,840
So what are we gonna do when we've repaired her?

269
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,440
It's bad for boats not to be yours,

270
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,840
but we could sail the seven seas.

271
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,039
Woo!

272
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,039
We need no power, Big Sheen.

273
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,639
I'd be happy just to explore around here.

274
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,039
Don't worry, Snork Maiden.

275
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:07,120
If we get big waves, we can sail between them, isn't that right?

276
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,960
Mom and Papa!

277
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,639
Well, in a way.

278
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,159
No, come on, let's get to work.

279
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,399
How about you, Snork? Will you help us?

280
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,960
Yes, of course.

281
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,679
Can I do anything for you, Mom and Papa?

282
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,080
Yes, if you'd like to, Mr. Hemmulon.

283
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,000
Well, I'm afraid I'm not much of a builder, but if there is something I could do.

284
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Well, let's get her out of the water first, shall we?

285
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah, mom!

286
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Let's do it!

287
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And we'll need some big logs to go under her.

288
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I think tin should be enough.

289
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'll be sure.

290
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Let's go, Prime!

291
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yes, you'll need to be safe to work on,

292
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,299
so we'll want something strong to keep her upright as well.

293
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,799
And lots of tools.

294
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,500
I'll go home and get some,

295
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,000
and I think we'll need a bucket and a shovel.

296
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll come with you, help you, tools.

297
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,500
Yes, you go.

298
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:27,000
I'll stay and keep guard in case the owner comes back. Sleep well.

299
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Man, the top sales.

300
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What?

301
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Are they all in bed, my dear? Yes, dear, sleeping like logs. I'm not surprised. They all work very, very hard today.

302
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I can't wait until the boat's ready and we can sail off somewhere.

303
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
My dear, we'll go anywhere in the world you like.

304
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Anywhere at all you've only got to say and off will jolly will go.

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It doesn't have to be far, dear.

306
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,440
Let's get to bed too. We've got an early stay. the world you like. Anywhere at all you've only got to say and off will Jolly will go.

307
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,240
It doesn't have to be far dear. Let's get to bed too. We've got an early start

308
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,920
at the morning. Oh, intellect was like me, aren't used to this hard work.

309
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,839
Oh, I'm tired out and I can hardly move. Mama, I better put these tired legs to bed.

310
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,960
Good night dear Moomin Papa. This will be good for him, I think.

311
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,559
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

312
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,480
A perfect fit if I may sit, so. Yeah, well now for the rest of her.

313
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
Right.

314
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Look at me, Mum, I'm doing the Tari. I know, little Mai. I'm only doing where you can't reach.

315
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Oh, alright then. Sniff you lazy land lever. Bring me some more Tari.

316
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
No, I won't. Get it yourself, you lazy thing. You wanted to do it.

317
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,160
I didn't want to carry Tari though anyway I'm the painter come on hurry up

318
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Mom and mama try cat it all out. Yes, please nook me Hey, feeling all right, Mr. Hemmielin?

319
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Yes, thank you.

320
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You're fixing the boat very quickly.

321
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, we sure are.

322
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I should be finished very soon.

323
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes, I'm sure it will.

324
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That's what I was afraid of.

325
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What shall I do then, Snuffkin?

326
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Well, maybe you can start collecting something else.

327
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What do you think?

328
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm sure it will.

329
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm sure it will.

330
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,500
That's what I was afraid of. What shall I do then, Snuffkin.

331
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,000
Well, maybe you could start collecting something else. What you think?

332
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Something else, like what?

333
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Well, I don't know.

334
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Anything, really? How about butterflies?

335
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
No, my second cousin does that, and he's a complete idiot.

336
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It has to be something interesting. Ornumans?

337
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Ornumans?

338
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah, you could collect those forever.

339
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,099
Not scientific.

340
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:11,099
Well, it's up to you, but I think you really ought to collect something, Mr. Hemmielin.

341
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,099
Uhhh...

342
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,700
Mama!

343
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,500
Mama!

344
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,099
Mama, quick hurry up!

345
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:26,000
We're gonna launch the new boat!

346
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Alright, wait for me, I'm coming!

347
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The sail you men at is perfect, Mom! Come on!

348
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Are you ready, everybody? I'll count to three, then push as hard as you can!

349
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,000
One, two, three! Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, my God!

350
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Oh, my God!

351
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Oh!

352
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Oh!

353
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Oh!

354
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Oh!

355
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Oh!

356
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And so, with their new boat, finally repaired and uncleaned,

357
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,920
Moomin and the others began to get very excited about their trip from the world.

358
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,319
Even Snork and Mr. Hemmulin were in unusually high spirits.

359
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,920
All aboard for a trial run!

360
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,359
I've decided what I'm going to collect.

361
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,039
Flowers, look, here's my first sample.

362
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:25,000
It's a sweet fryer. Rosa Robiganosa.

363
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That's great. Good for you.

364
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Snork maiden, I've just had a new idea for my flying ship. I'm certain it'll work this time.

365
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Of course it will, Snork. Good luck.

366
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I better get on. Right, start paddling everyone.

367
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
We'll be back soon, my dear, moment mama.

368
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Take as long as you like, Papa.

369
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll prepare something cold for when you get back.

370
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
One, two, one, two.

371
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Away, away, in the deep blue yonder.

372
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:08,000
One, two, three.

373
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements. Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

374
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
They're always happy and always at play.

375
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

376
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The movements.

377
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The movements.

378
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
They love the laughter and they love the living.

379
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The movements. the living, the movements believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements

380
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
they're always happy and goes at play

381
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:13,000
the movements are having fun day after day, the moment, the moment.
