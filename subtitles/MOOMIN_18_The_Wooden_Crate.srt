1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come. Come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you on your TV they are the movements. They are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So come with me give me your hand. I'll take you up to a moment land. You can fly just like a bird. Sing the best song ever.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There were the movements. There were the movements. There were the movements.

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:31,000
There were the movements. There were the movements.

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It was the end of summer but still every day seemed hotter than the last.

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Movement Valley had had no rain for weeks and finally the river had dried up.

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Papa says this weather is a catastrophe.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh not really.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But it is. He says movement Valley will turn into a desert if it carries on.

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't think that will happen movement.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Papa can't ever remember it so hot even the river has dried up.

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No that does worry me. I can't fish anymore.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
In all my travels I found that droughts like this are always followed by a real heavy downpour.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well it's too hot for me anyway.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh it's so hot I can't think.

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I can I can always think of something.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well well even the weeds are wilting.

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The sea never dries up does it?

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Of course not stupid wherever the fish go.

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm going swimming.

22
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Here you are.

23
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Watch this.

24
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Ah!

25
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Ah!

26
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Ah!

27
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ouch that hurt.

28
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What's this stupid box doing here?

29
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think it's floated from foreign lands.

30
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What's it got in it?

31
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Perhaps it's full of priceless jewels.

32
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No it wouldn't float so high in the water if it was.

33
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
A tiara packed in wood shavings.

34
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I can use a new comb too.

35
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What have you found you too?

36
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I treasure it.

37
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No we don't think so. It's not heavy enough.

38
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But you never know snork maiden.

39
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's open it and see.

40
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Come on Slays push me a shore.

41
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Perhaps it's gold nuggets in here.

42
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Are diamonds or something to eat?

43
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What is this?

44
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Well seeds maybe.

45
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What sort of seeds?

46
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well at first glance I'd say they might be tropical plants.

47
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Really?

48
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What plants are tropical?

49
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Well species like banana or mango.

50
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Banana and mango.

51
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Well I haven't done a lot of research on tropical plants so I can't be sure but they do look like it.

52
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I know mama. Why don't we plant them?

53
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Good idea woman.

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The thing is we don't have a tropical climate.

55
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm afraid they wouldn't grow here at all.

56
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's plant them shall we?

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They won't bear any fruit so don't get too excited.

58
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh well it seems tropical enough to me Mr. Hanuman.

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
At least we can try can't we?

60
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I want to see what papaya looks like and ugly fruit.

61
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I want mangoes growing all around my banjo window.

62
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Let's plant them shall we?

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I tell you they're strictly tropical they won't take root at all.

64
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It certainly seems that mama is enjoying herself Mr. Hanuman.

65
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't think it'll be much use.

66
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Well perhaps not but it's still worth the fun in trying.

67
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Imagine woman valley a tropical jungle.

68
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Huh huh.

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh Mr. Hanuman.

70
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Do you think these seeds will grow into real fruit trees?

71
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Let me see.

72
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What have you got here little my?

73
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I could very well be mistaken but I think this one is a mango seed.

74
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Thanks.

75
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And why do you want to know a little my?

76
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Because I'm only growing fruit trees.

77
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hmm thanks.

78
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And why do you want to know a little my?

79
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Because I'm only growing fruit.

80
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I want to be sure I'm not planning stupid orchids or passion flowers or something.

81
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Mr. Hemuman.

82
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Can you tell me which one of these is banana?

83
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah I'm not really too sure but I think it's this one.

84
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You want to grow an orchid too snorke maiden?

85
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I just want to plant a banana tree in a really special place.

86
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's Moon's favorite fruit.

87
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I think she'll be disappointed bananas won't grow here.

88
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This weather doesn't belong here either.

89
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If it gets any hotter I'll melt.

90
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I can't wait for dusk so it'll cool down a bit.

91
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Hmm.

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Isn't it wonderful to go to sleep looking at the stars?

93
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And it's not so hot anymore.

94
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll sleep like a log tonight.

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You always do don't you little my?

96
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Well sleep like an extra heavy log then.

97
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Snorke maiden, why don't you sleep under that tree with moon men and little my?

98
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Because I can't see the stars from there and it makes me feel romantic looking at them.

99
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But you're going to get very wet if it starts raining in the night.

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You're joking surely mama.

101
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Not at all.

102
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But it hasn't rained for ages and there aren't any clouds or anything.

103
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Just stars.

104
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
All the toothpicks fell on the floor and that's a sure sign of rain.

105
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Snorke maiden won't mind if she gets all wet.

106
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Moon Mama, that should be happy.

107
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Who, why is that?

108
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Because then she'll know that the special tree will start growing and that's very important to her.

109
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's true.

110
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Good night everyone.

111
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I hope you sleep well.

112
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Good night everybody.

113
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Good night woman.

114
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Good night, don't snorke.

115
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's too hot to sleep.

116
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why don't you sleep outside like the children?

117
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think I will.

118
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
A thunderstorm.

119
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I told you the toothpicks are never wrong.

120
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hey it's raining movement.

121
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Wake up movement.

122
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh is it morning?

123
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The sun's really bright.

124
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
No it's raining.

125
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Rainy?

126
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Look at that.

127
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You look I'm getting wet I'm going inside.

128
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So mama was right about the rain.

129
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Hey snorke maiden.

130
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Doesn't she look sweet?

131
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Snorke maiden.

132
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Is it raining?

133
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's very clever.

134
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Your mother knows everything doesn't she?

135
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
She does.

136
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Not yet.

137
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I want to feel the rain on my face.

138
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's been so long.

139
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You want to feel it much longer?

140
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's raining.

141
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's raining.

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Mangoes.

143
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's impossible.

144
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Gosh.

145
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
By my tail a jungle that's a tropical jungle.

146
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Wake up, wake up you two.

147
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There's a jungle outside.

148
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
We've planted a jungle.

149
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
A jungle.

150
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You're right moment.

151
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Those seeds have not only sprouted.

152
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I know they're big trees.

153
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I've never known trees to grow like that.

154
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's bad.

155
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I know.

156
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I've never known trees to grow like that.

157
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's...

158
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's...

159
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I think I'll go and play Tarzan.

160
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I wish my lettuce seeds would do that move in papa.

161
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
There's magic here somewhere mama.

162
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Let's go and explore.

163
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's rain drumming on the campus.

164
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It must be.

165
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Snuffkin?

166
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What a nurse all this.

167
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Well, we found a crate of tropical seeds

168
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and planted them last night.

169
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And this morning while you can see it's like magic.

170
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's fantastic.

171
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I know.

172
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
We can go on a safari.

173
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I've seen nothing like it.

174
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What kind of flower is this?

175
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It looks like an orchid to me.

176
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This is a real tropical jungle isn't it Snuffkin?

177
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Not quite.

178
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What do you mean?

179
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Well, Moomin, a real jungle would have wild animals in it, wouldn't it?

180
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh yeah, like tigers and snakes.

181
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
This is more of a tropical botanical garden, I suppose.

182
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's Moomin's little mind.

183
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
He can have the peel.

184
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This is a life.

185
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Stop, little mind.

186
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, well.

187
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What are you looking for dear?

188
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
My solar toady.

189
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You what?

190
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
My sun helmet, I can't go into the jungle without it.

191
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I didn't know you had one.

192
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I used it for a fancy dress party once I know.

193
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I put it in a box somewhere.

194
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh, here it is.

195
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Very dashing dear.

196
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I thought so too.

197
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh, I know.

198
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

199
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Splendid protection is hat.

200
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Papa, what in earth are you doing?

201
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I want to get into the cellar.

202
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What for?

203
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
To get my gun.

204
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Your gun?

205
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Only fools venture into the jungle without a proper gun.

206
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I don't think you need a gun, Papa.

207
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And why not?

208
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Because there aren't any wild animals.

209
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Well, one of the seas might have been an egg or something.

210
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Look at these, for instance, they look very animal.

211
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Very odd animals.

212
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
More of an odd plant, I think.

213
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'd stay away from them.

214
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
They could be very dangerous.

215
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But they've got eyes.

216
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Careful.

217
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I think they're man-eating plants.

218
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Man-eating.

219
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Stop that.

220
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Help.

221
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Help.

222
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, they're trying to eat me.

223
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
They want to feed me to their young.

224
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, help me.

225
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh, help.

226
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They're tearing my tail.

227
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

228
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, oh, dear.

229
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

230
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Help.

231
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh!

232
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh, no, oh, oh, oh, oh.

233
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

234
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Well done, my little maya.

235
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Just saved my life.

236
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Well, I saved your tail, anyway.

237
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh.

238
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh.

239
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh.

240
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, oh.

241
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,600
Oh! It's something to jam this door shut!

242
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,540
Come on! Hurry!

243
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,800
Oh! Oh! Oh, no! We... you can't hold on much longer!

244
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Hmm.

245
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Hmm.

246
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Huh?

247
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Hmm.

248
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Hmm.

249
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Hmm.

250
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Hmm.

251
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Hmm.

252
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Hmm.

253
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
That should keep them in now, shouldn't it?

254
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
Well, I don't think they could push their way through that lot.

255
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Hmm. They had a very strong grip on my tail.

256
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
He mustn't underestimate them.

257
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Anything wrong?

258
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,800
You bet! The seller's full of man-eating plants tried to gobble up moment papa!

259
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Oh!

260
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Oh my goodness!

261
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
What's the matter?

262
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
You can get straight from the seller into the kitchen.

263
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,800
What? Oh no, mama!

264
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Oh my gosh!

265
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Oh, hello!

266
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Cue, we got here just in time!

267
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,800
What ever's the matter with you? Are you all playing Tarzan?

268
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Oh no, mama!

269
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,800
I'm making grandmas if you ever get a tropical fruit recipe.

270
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,800
And perhaps now it's rained I can wash this dirty floor.

271
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Ah! Ah! By the great bumble I don't believe this a tropical rainforest!

272
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Ah! Ah!

273
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Ah! Ah! Transcendentia megaloids!

274
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
And yes, a dispensia florian wonder!

275
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Goodness me, I can collect a whole tropical hermoreum right here in Moomin Valley!

276
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Ah, Trowel, that's what I need. I'll get one from the Moomins!

277
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

278
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

279
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Yeah.

280
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Yeah.

281
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,000
Must say they're not the tiniest family.

282
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,240
I'll have to move this.

283
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,040
Oh, this old furniture.

284
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Yeah.

285
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Yeah.

286
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Yeah.

287
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
Yeah.

288
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Huh.

289
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
Huh.

290
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Huh.

291
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
Huh.

292
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,040
Huh.

293
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Huh.

294
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Huh.

295
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,040
Huh.

296
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Huh.

297
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Huh.

298
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Huh.

299
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Huh.

300
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Huh.

301
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Huh.

302
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Huh.

303
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Huh.

304
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Huh.

305
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
Huh.

306
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Huh.

307
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Oh, here we go.

308
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Me get out with Ormysik.

309
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,040
Huh.

310
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
Huh.

311
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Huh.

312
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Huh.

313
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Help!

314
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
I've got many things planned after this.

315
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
What?

316
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
They must have got out.

317
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Huh.

318
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Huh.

319
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Huh.

320
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Huh.

321
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Huh.

322
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
Huh.

323
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Huh.

324
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Huh.

325
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Huh.

326
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Huh.

327
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Huh.

328
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Huh.

329
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Huh.

330
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Huh.

331
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
They were in the cellar.

332
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Did you open the door, Mr. Hamilin?

333
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
Well, yes.

334
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,040
I wanted to borrow a trowel.

335
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,040
Mr. Hamilin, you know all about plants.

336
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Do you have any idea how we can get rid of them?

337
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
They're man-eaters, you know?

338
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Can't rid of them.

339
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Huh.

340
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
Well, let's see.

341
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
We are in a bit of a fix.

342
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,040
I have heard that they have reacted to music.

343
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Music.

344
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Snoopkin, you could play your harmonica.

345
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Hmm.

346
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Hmm.

347
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Look, they've started dancing.

348
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,040
Keep it up, Snoopkin.

349
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:27,040
What will they do if he stops playing?

350
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
I really don't know.

351
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
Oh, what's this?

352
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Oh.

353
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Oh.

354
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,040
They're rather sweet when they don't try to eat you.

355
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,040
And that was how a tropical jungle grew

356
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,040
and surrounded movement house in one night.

357
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Is it going to stay?

358
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
And for how long?

359
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,040
And what will the man-eating plants do

360
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,040
if Snoopkin stops playing?

361
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,040
They love the laughter

362
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:15,040
and they love the living, the movements.

363
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Believing in sharing and caring

364
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,040
and giving the movements.

365
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,040
They're always happy and always at play.

366
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,040
The movements are having fun day after day.

367
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,040
The movements.

368
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,040
They love the laughter

369
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,040
