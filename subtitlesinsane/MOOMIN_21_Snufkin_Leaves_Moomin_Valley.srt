1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're here for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm going to say that I'm not going to say that. I'm going to say that I'm not going to say that. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:01:39,000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird, there was a movement, there was a movement, there la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, The fall has come to Moon Valley, and the memory of sunshine filled ours fades as the days

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,799
become shorter and the nights longer.

11
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:48,120
The wind blows away the falling leaves, and the blue skies of summer are now gray and cloudy.

12
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,640
Winter is just around the corner.

13
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,920
Snork maiden!

14
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,560
Where are you going?

15
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,319
Oh, I'm just taking my brother, his lunch little my.

16
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,519
Hmm.

17
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,120
He must have nearly finished the flying ship by now.

18
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,240
Oh no, not even Snork works that quickly.

19
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,599
Well, have you seen it?

20
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,800
No, I haven't.

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,039
He won't even let me come into his workshop.

22
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,800
Is he afraid it'll disappear if someone sees it?

23
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,639
He hasn't said why, but I suppose all great inventors

24
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,960
have to be very careful.

25
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,879
Someone might want to steal their ideas.

26
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,139
Moment told me he's dying to have to be very careful. Someone might want to steal their ideas.

27
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:46,560
Movement told me he's dying to have a look at it. I've got my hands full. Come on, quickly! Look what I've got! It's a record player!

28
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,000
Ah!

29
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,800
Do you think you can get it working, dear?

30
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Oh, yes, of course, Mama.

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,400
Why did people always give me things that are broken?

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,919
It'd be nice to have something that worked for a change.

33
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,879
Movement, Papa will get it working for you.

34
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,479
My auntie said that the record was all right, though.

35
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,599
It's dance music.

36
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,080
She's had it for ages, but I've never heard it.

37
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Oh, that's nice.

38
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,599
It's years since I danced, but it seems like only yesterday.

39
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,039
Do you remember what funny was Papa?

40
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,199
Dancing.

41
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,360
Oh, yeah.

42
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,680
I see.

43
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,000
Have you fixed it, Papa?

44
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:41,719
Huh?

45
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,879
I can hear music.

46
00:03:42,879 --> 00:04:07,000
Doesn't sound like snuffkin! Right, have you got the idea now?

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes, I think so. Me too!

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Come on! Let's see you then.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,000
May I? Come on! Well, let's see you then.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Meal?

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Did I eat it?

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, wow!

53
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Look at Papa Moon and he is a great dancer. Well, man, can you dance, Sniff?

54
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
I've never tried.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Right, well, try now. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, yeah.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, yeah.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, yeah.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh, yeah.

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, yeah.

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, yeah.

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, yeah.

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, yeah.

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, yeah.

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh!

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Baby, baby, baby.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh, that was fun. Oh, Dan, you still wear me out like this.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You've got no sense of rhythm at all, Sniff.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I can still dance, though, can I?

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh, are you ready, Papa?

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I think I'll have to sit this one out, Mom. All right.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Little Mide, no, thank you.

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll dance on my own.

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Well then, why don't you dance with me and dance, Smith?

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Ah!

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Hmm.

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh. Oh, it looks like it's here for the day.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, what horrible weather, Snuffkin.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They're having fun.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, sniff brought this old record player over,

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and we've been dancing.

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I haven't done it for years and years,

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and well, aren't you coming in?

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I can smell winter in the air, Moomin' Papa.

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Huh?

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, yes, you're right.

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Snuffkin, why?

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Snuffkin, come and answer me! No thanks, it's mine.

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Sorry! I'm sorry!

91
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh, you!

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Hmm, what's the matter with this?

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm afraid it's broken. Just when we were having so much fun. Will you be able to fix it again, dear? No, even I can't mend it now.

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh, please, dry papa, will you?

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hmm.

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Snuffkin, do you know anything about record players?

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
No, I'm afraid not.

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh, dear.

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But what?

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll play my harmonic if you want to continue to dance.

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And then you can fiddle around with the machine.

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
How would that be? I'll play my harmonic if you want to continue to dance,

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and then you can fiddle around with the machine.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How would that be?

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, yes, please.

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That'd be great, Snuffkin.

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Thanks.

108
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,500
Now then, what would be a good tune to dance to?

109
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's see. Oh Now what's this? Oh, no, I give up.

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
May I?

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, no.

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I give up.

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
May I?

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, no. You're thinking about going away again, aren't you, Snowfken?

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,779
I know that you go south every year when winter comes,

116
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,299
but I'll still miss you, though,

117
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:11,600
and I wish you could stay here in Moomin Valley.

118
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,379
I know, Moomin.

119
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,820
Who are they?

120
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,259
How do you fathomers, I think?

121
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,000
I wonder where they're going.

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't know. A deserted island I expect.

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Probably the best place for them.

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
When are you leaving, self-kin?

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh, I haven't decided yet.

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So you'll be here for a bit longer then.

127
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Do you know where you're going?

128
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No. It must be fun traveling.

129
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes, most of the time.

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's the best way of meeting new people and still being on your own.

131
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I wish we could do that, but even when we hibernate and go to sleep, we're never really alone.

132
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I guess I'd hibernate too if I had to stay up here a moment.

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
During all the freezing winter snows.

134
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,720
Do you think we could have a good time? Stay up here, movement. During all the freezing winter snows.

135
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:17,519
Do you think I could go south with Snuffkin, Papa?

136
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,440
Not really. It's the moment way to hibernate.

137
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,399
It's a family custom passed down through the years

138
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,000
by our ancestors.

139
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But Papa, I don't want to go to sleep for months on end. I want to travel south with Snuffkin.

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh, movement.

141
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You promise you'll be back on the first day of spring.

142
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, Mama! Does that mean I can really go?

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I can't wait to tell Snuffkin. I can, can't I?

144
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,740
Well, if you really want to, I don't suppose we'll stop you.

145
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,740
We'll be Papa.

146
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,580
Now my parents didn't mind when I traveled around in my youth,

147
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,580
so yes, or I'd more than...

148
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,580
Oh, thank you, Papa! Oh, thank you, Mama!

149
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:09,000
That's great, but what was Snuffkin say?

150
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Well, it's a good idea. And I gotta say it'd be fun to have you a long woman.

151
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So I can come with you, Snuffkin?

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No.

153
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What?

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm sorry, but I've got to go on my own.

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,799
Don't be disappointed, movement. I told you I travel alone.

156
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,799
I need to.

157
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,299
After spending the rest of the year here,

158
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:29,600
just as I need to be here,

159
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,299
after spending the winter alone,

160
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:33,299
and the joy of returning to movement valley

161
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,799
is something I wouldn't miss.

162
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,000
What's not, Ken? I thought...

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,500
The time will soon pass,

164
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,799
and you'll be asleep through most of it.

165
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,500
You won't notice I'm not here.

166
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,639
I'll see you next spring, movement. I'll be back on the first

167
00:11:46,639 --> 00:12:06,000
day as usual, I promise, as soon as the weather waromin. Oh, it's all right. Oh, come on, Moomin.

168
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You'll have to tie them a bit tighter than that.

169
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It'll be a cold winter, so we'll need lots of water.

170
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'll be right back.

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'll be right back.

172
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'll be right back.

173
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'll be right back.

174
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll be right back. a bit tighter than that.

175
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It'll be a cold winter, so we'll need lots of wood to keep us going till spring colors.

176
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I know.

177
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Now you want to stay warm, don't you?

178
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
When I grow up, I'll go south on my own, too.

179
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yes, of course you will.

180
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Is Mom in home? Yes.

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
How is he? Is he still down in the dumps?

182
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm afraid so. Grandmoss cheer you up, recipe didn't work.

183
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh, I think he's being silly just because Snuffkin's going away.

184
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I suppose he is.

185
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But don't worry, mama.

186
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:39,500
He won't be miserable much longer because I've got a surprise for him. Ah. Hmm.

187
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:44,100
Are you there, Mom? A moment, don't cry.

188
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,000
Boys don't cry, I suppose. Of course they do. Well, I'm not crying, so they're...

189
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
All right, but I do think you should get up now.

190
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh, and why should I?

191
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I have a surprise for you!

192
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't want any surprises.

193
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Come on, I'm going to go and see Snorkin' his workshop.

194
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But you know he won't let us in.

195
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I've tried before.

196
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh yes, he will today.

197
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I promise.

198
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What?

199
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You mean Snorko's show is over?

200
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm not going to let him in. I'm not going to let him in. I'm not going to let him in. I'm not going't let us in. I've tried before. Oh yes, he will today. I promise.

201
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What? You mean Snorkel shows his flying ship at last?

202
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yes, he said. Has he really finished it then?

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
No, not yet. There's still a lot of work to do on it.

204
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Then I wonder why he's letting us see it. He's always refused before.

205
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What's made him change his mind?

206
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,799
But I asked him this time.

207
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,440
I said I wanted to show it to you.

208
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,159
It just needed a woman's touch.

209
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,120
What did you say to him?

210
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
First he said absolutely not.

211
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,679
But when I told him how ill you were

212
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:37,159
and that you probably wouldn't be with us much longer,

213
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:39,600
he gave in and said we could see it just you and me

214
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,360
of climb up.

215
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,080
That little snork maiden.

216
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,200
Oh good.

217
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,299
Because sometimes, and people are very depressed

218
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:46,460
and just lying bad.

219
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,100
They've done something bad.

220
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,659
Oh, stop it snorked, maiden.

221
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,100
Don't say things like that.

222
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,580
I'm only trying to cheer you up.

223
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,860
So remember, don't tell us all.

224
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,820
No one else must know anything about it.

225
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:07,000
Okay. Let's go.

226
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
No.

227
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
A little my.

228
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Little my.

229
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Trouble. No. Oh, little my. Little my.

230
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Trouble.

231
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Big Trouble.

232
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
We must fool her.

233
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yes, but how?

234
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What can we do?

235
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I know what we'll do.

236
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What?

237
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Quick, Moomin!

238
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You just agree with everything I say, Snork Maiden.

239
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh.

240
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I thought you were in bad Moomin.

241
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
No, we're going to see Snork.

242
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes.

243
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Really?

244
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yes, he needs to clear a runway for when the fly ship is finished.

245
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We're going to help him do it, that's all.

246
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes.

247
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Are you really, mumen?

248
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You got out of bad to do that.

249
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm afraid I find it very strange that snork has asked to go along and help him cut down bushes and dig up roots and things.

250
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You might have noticed I'm not a complete fool.

251
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,879
But it's true, little migh. Oh, yes things. You might have noticed I'm not a complete fool.

252
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,320
But it's true, little mime.

253
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Oh, yes.

254
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,679
Well, at least you could have invented a better lie.

255
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,120
You must think I'm pretty stupid to believe a pathetic story like that.

256
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,840
But it's the truth.

257
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,039
And we need your help.

258
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,039
Yeah.

259
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,039
Don't bother, don't bother.

260
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,559
I don't want to hear anymore.

261
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:24,159
I think it's very sad that you have to pretend.

262
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,399
You're trying to hide something from me,

263
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,480
and I'm not interested in what sort of sneaky underhanded thing it is.

264
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,559
But little mime?

265
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,320
No, but...

266
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,600
And anyway, I'm a little too busy at the moment to take any notice of what's going on.

267
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Goodbye!

268
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,759
Come on.

269
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,840
Oh, that was close.

270
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah! Phew, that was close. Yeah.

271
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Ha! Think, thank you. Keep a secret from me, do they?

272
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Are you alone? Of course we are. I promised, didn't I?

273
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Come in then.

274
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Wow!

275
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's nearly ready, isn't it?

276
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh no, there's a lot more to do.

277
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The machine isn't half finished yet.

278
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And as you can see, there's a lot to do on the ship itself,

279
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
but I'm getting there slowly.

280
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I never thought it would be so fantastic, smork.

281
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Well, I suppose you could say the design wasn't a complete failure.

282
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm quite sure it'll fly beautifully.

283
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, thank you. Do you really think it will, woman?

284
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I can see it now. High open the air, dodging in and out of the clouds.

285
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Way up above the world.

286
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Well, I'm glad to see that you're so perceptive and quite right.

287
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh, how very thoughtful of me.

288
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Shouldn't you sit down and rest? You know your illness?

289
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It doesn't help to get too excited.

290
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Ha, I shouldn't worry, Snork. There's nothing wrong with him.

291
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh, little my, how did you get in here?

292
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Throw that door!

293
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,039
But I always keep it oh oh oh no I

294
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,680
Must have forgotten to lock it and it's a bit late to do it now, isn't it?

295
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,759
But don't worry if I wanted to get in I'd get in locks or no locks

296
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:41,319
Oh, you like to us little my of course, but so did you telling me that stupid story now or even right?

297
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,000
Now listen little my don't ever tell anybody what you see over here.

298
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
All right!

299
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Ugh!

300
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
This invention contains so many outstanding new features

301
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
it is difficult to know where to begin.

302
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But let me start with the most exciting part of the whole construction.

303
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It could go as a tree or rather the concept of a tree, thrilling, beautiful, impossible, dangerous. Can you take the ship down, Moonman? I'd like you to land at that side of the lake. Oh, why do you want to get off?

304
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Aren't you having fun flying about up here?

305
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I want to be on my own.

306
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh, please stay here.

307
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'll let you steer if you want.

308
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
No, really, Moonman, please.

309
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Bye now.

310
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No!

311
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Snowpeer! Bye now. No!

312
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Snuff me!

313
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Ugh! So long then, Moonman, my friend. I'll see you again next year. The first day of spring. Oh. Go by then, Snuffkin.

314
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Off for the winter, eh, Snuffkin. Yes, goodbye Mr. Hemelin.

315
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
We'll be seeing you in the spring.

316
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yes, when the snow's are gone.

317
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh, to be young and winter came to Moomin Valley.

318
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And in Moomin's heart, snuffing and the spring seemed a long, long way away

319
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
They love the laughter and they love the living The movements

320
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements

321
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
They're always happy and always at play

322
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,279
The movements are having fun day after day

323
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,480
The movements

324
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,640
The movements

325
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,319
They love the laughter and they love the living

326
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,839
The movements

327
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:44,880
They're leaving and sharing and caring

328
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,000
And giving the movements.

329
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
They're always happy and goes at play.

330
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The Moons are having fun day after day.

331
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The Moons. The move is the move is
