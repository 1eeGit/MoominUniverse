00:00.000 --> 00:18.600
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come.

00:18.600 --> 00:26.880
Come on and sit down here with me, they're for you on your TV, they are the movements,

00:26.880 --> 00:29.880
they are the movements.

00:29.880 --> 00:36.120
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

00:36.120 --> 00:44.480
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were

00:44.480 --> 00:55.840
the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:55.840 --> 00:58.840
there were the movements.

01:25.840 --> 01:39.040
Fall has come to movement valley and the memory of sunshine filled ours fades as the days

01:39.040 --> 01:41.840
become shorter and the nights longer.

01:41.840 --> 01:47.040
The wind blows away the falling leaves and the blue skies of summer are now grey and

01:47.040 --> 01:51.040
cloudy, winter is just around the corner.

01:51.040 --> 01:54.040
Snork maiden!

01:54.040 --> 01:59.040
Where are you going?

01:59.040 --> 02:05.040
Oh I'm just taking my brother, his lunch little my, he must have nearly finished the flying

02:05.040 --> 02:06.040
ship by now.

02:06.040 --> 02:10.040
Oh no, not even snork works that quickly.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.040
Well have you seen it?

02:12.040 --> 02:15.040
No I haven't, he won't even let me come into his workshop.

02:15.040 --> 02:17.840
Is he afraid it'll disappear if someone sees it?

02:17.840 --> 02:22.320
He hasn't said why but I suppose all great inventors have to be very careful, someone

02:22.320 --> 02:25.040
might want to steal their ideas.

02:25.040 --> 02:32.040
The woman told me he's dying to have a look at it.

02:32.040 --> 02:43.040
Hey woman, open the door, I've got my hands full, come on quickly.

02:43.040 --> 02:50.040
Look what I've got, it's a regular player.

02:51.040 --> 02:57.040
Oh.

02:57.040 --> 03:00.040
Do you think you can get it working dear?

03:00.040 --> 03:02.040
Oh yes of course mom.

03:02.040 --> 03:06.040
Why do people always give me things that are broken, it'd be nice to have something that

03:06.040 --> 03:10.040
worked for a change.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.040
Movement probably will get it working for you.

03:13.040 --> 03:18.040
My auntie said that the record was alright though it stands music, she's had it for ages

03:18.040 --> 03:19.040
but I've never heard it.

03:19.040 --> 03:23.040
Oh that's nice, it's years since I danced but it seems like only yesterday.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.040
Do you remember what fun it was Papa?

03:26.040 --> 03:28.040
Dancing.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.040
Oh yeah, I see.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.040
Have you fixed it Papa?

03:41.040 --> 03:42.040
Huh?

03:42.040 --> 03:43.040
I can hear music.

03:43.040 --> 03:46.040
Doesn't sound like snuffkin.

03:49.040 --> 04:16.040
Right, have you got the idea now?

04:16.040 --> 04:18.040
Yes I think so.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.040
Me too.

04:20.040 --> 04:25.040
Come on, let's see you then.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.040
What?

04:28.040 --> 04:31.040
Did I do it?

04:31.040 --> 04:39.040
Oh wow.

04:39.040 --> 04:45.040
Look at Papa woman, he's a great dancer.

04:49.040 --> 04:54.040
Well then, can you dance snuff?

04:54.040 --> 04:56.040
I've never tried.

04:56.040 --> 05:00.040
Right, well try now.

05:01.040 --> 05:06.040
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.040
Yep.

05:10.040 --> 05:15.040
Hi, yeah.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.040
Hi, hi.

05:18.040 --> 05:22.040
Hey, hey.

05:22.040 --> 05:27.040
Hi, hey, hey, hey, hey.

05:27.040 --> 05:32.040
Oh that was fun.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.040
Oh, dancing never used to wear me out like this.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.040
You've got no sense of rhythm at all, Snuff.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.040
It's still dance though, can't I?

05:41.040 --> 05:43.040
Oh, are you ready, Papa?

05:43.040 --> 05:45.040
I think I'll have to sit this one out, Mama.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.040
All right.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.040
You all right?

05:51.040 --> 05:52.040
No, thank you.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.040
I'll dance on my own.

05:53.040 --> 05:56.040
Well then, why don't you dance with me and dance, Smith?

05:56.040 --> 05:58.040
Ah.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.040
Hmm.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.040
Oh.

06:09.040 --> 06:13.040
Oh, it looks like it's here for the day.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.040
Oh, what horrible weather, snuffkin.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.040
Yes.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.040
They're having fun.

06:29.040 --> 06:33.040
Well, Smith brought this old record player over and we've been dancing.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.040
I haven't done it for years and years.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.040
Well, aren't you coming in?

06:37.040 --> 06:39.040
I can smell winter in the air, Moomin, Papa.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.040
Huh?

06:41.040 --> 06:43.040
Oh, yes.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.040
Yeah, all right.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.040
Snuffkin, why?

06:58.040 --> 07:00.040
Snuffkin, come and dance with me.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.040
No, thanks.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.040
Sorry.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.040
I'm sorry.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.040
Oh, you.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.040
Hmm, what's the matter with this?

07:26.040 --> 07:27.040
I'm afraid it's broken.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.040
Just when we were having so much fun.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.040
Will you be able to fix it again, dear?

07:31.040 --> 07:33.040
No, even I can't mend it now.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.040
Oh, please, try, Papa.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.040
Will you?

07:36.040 --> 07:40.040
Hmm, snuffkin, do you know anything about record players?

07:40.040 --> 07:42.040
No, I'm afraid not.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.040
Oh, dear.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.040
But what?

07:44.040 --> 07:47.040
I'll play my harmonic if you want to continue to dance.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.040
And then you can fiddle around with the machine.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.040
How would that be?

07:50.040 --> 07:51.040
Oh, yes, please.

07:51.040 --> 07:53.040
That'd be great, snuffkin.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.040
Thanks.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.040
Now then, what would be a good tune to dance to?

07:56.040 --> 07:57.040
Let's see.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.040
Oh, no.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.040
Oh, no.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.040
Now what's this?

08:32.040 --> 08:34.040
Oh, no.

08:34.040 --> 08:35.040
I give up.

08:36.040 --> 08:38.040
Me?

08:38.040 --> 08:39.040
Me?

08:59.040 --> 09:02.040
You're thinking about going away again, aren't you, Snuffkin?

09:02.040 --> 09:03.040
Hmm.

09:04.040 --> 09:08.040
I know that you go south every year when winter comes, but I'll still miss you, though,

09:08.040 --> 09:11.040
and I wish you could stay here in Moomin Valley.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.040
I know, Moomin.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.040
Where are they?

09:23.040 --> 09:24.040
How do you find them, I think?

09:24.040 --> 09:26.040
I wonder where they're going.

09:26.040 --> 09:27.040
I don't know.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.040
A deserted island, I expect.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.040
Probably the best place for them.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.040
When are you leaving, Snuffkin?

09:35.040 --> 09:37.040
Oh, I haven't decided yet.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.040
So, you'll be here for a bit longer then.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.040
Do you know where you're going?

09:43.040 --> 09:44.040
No.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.040
It must be fun traveling.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.040
Yes, most of the time.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.040
It's the best way of meeting new people and still being on your own.

09:52.040 --> 09:58.040
I wish we could do that, but even when we hibernate and go to sleep, we're never really alone.

09:58.040 --> 10:01.040
I guess I'd hibernate too if I had to stay up here in Moomin.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.040
During all the freezing winter snows.

10:09.040 --> 10:12.040
Do you think I could go south with Snuffkin, Papa?

10:17.040 --> 10:20.040
Not really, it's the moment way to hibernate.

10:21.040 --> 10:25.040
It's a family custom passed down through the years by our ancestors.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.040
But Papa, I don't want to go to sleep for months on end.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.040
I want to travel south with Snuffkin.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.040
Oh, Moomin.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.040
You promise you'll be back on the first day of spring.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.040
Oh, Mama!

10:37.040 --> 10:40.040
Does that mean I can really go?

10:40.040 --> 10:42.040
I can't wait to tell Snuffkin.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.040
I can, can't I?

10:43.040 --> 10:47.040
Well, if you really want to, I don't suppose we'll stop you.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.040
We'll be Papa.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.040
Now, my parents didn't mind when I traveled around in my youth.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.040
So, yes, all right, Moomin.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.040
Oh, thank you, Papa.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.040
Mama, thank you, Mama.

10:59.040 --> 11:02.040
That's great, but what will Snuffkin say?

11:09.040 --> 11:11.040
Well, it's a good idea.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.040
And I got to say it'd be fun to have you a long Moomin.

11:14.040 --> 11:17.040
So, I can come with you Snuffkin?

11:17.040 --> 11:18.040
No.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.040
What?

11:19.040 --> 11:22.040
I'm sorry, but I've got to go on my own.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.040
Don't be disappointed, Moomin.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.040
I told you I travel alone.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.040
I need to.

11:27.040 --> 11:30.040
After spending the rest of the year here, just as I need to be here,

11:30.040 --> 11:32.040
after spending the winter alone.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.040
And the joy of returning to Moomin Valley is something I wouldn't miss.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.040
Which Snuffkin, I thought.

11:37.040 --> 11:41.040
The time will soon pass, and you'll be asleep through most of it.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.040
You won't notice I'm not here.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.040
I'll see you next spring, Moomin.

11:45.040 --> 11:48.040
I'll be back on the first day as usual.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.040
I promise, as soon as the weather warms.

11:50.040 --> 11:54.040
And when the flowers start to grow, nothing will keep me from Moomin Valley.

12:13.040 --> 12:16.040
Ah, I'm sorry I didn't work out for you, Moomin.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.040
Oh, it's all right.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.040
Oh, come on, Moomin.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.040
You'll have to tie them a bit tighter than that.

12:27.040 --> 12:30.040
It'll be a cold winter, so we'll need lots of wood

12:30.040 --> 12:32.040
to keep us going till spring comes.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.040
I know.

12:33.040 --> 12:36.040
Now you want to stay warm, don't you?

12:36.040 --> 12:39.040
When I grow up, I'll go south on my own, too.

12:39.040 --> 12:42.040
Yes, of course you will.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.040
Ah, ah, ah.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.040
Is Moomin home?

13:01.040 --> 13:03.040
Yes.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.040
How is he?

13:04.040 --> 13:06.040
Is he still down in the dumps?

13:06.040 --> 13:09.040
I'm afraid so, grandma's cheer you up, recipe didn't work.

13:09.040 --> 13:13.040
Ah, I think he's being silly just because Snuffkin's going away.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.040
I suppose he is.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.040
But don't worry, mama.

13:18.040 --> 13:22.040
He won't be miserable much longer, because I've got a surprise for him.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.040
Are you there, Moomin?

13:42.040 --> 13:44.040
A moment, don't cry.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.040
Boys don't cry, I suppose.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.040
Of course they do.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.040
Well, I'm not crying so, there.

13:49.040 --> 13:52.040
All right, but I do think you should get up now.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.040
Oh, and why should I?

13:54.040 --> 13:56.040
I have a surprise for you.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.040
I don't want any surprises.

13:57.040 --> 14:00.040
Come on, I'm going to go and see Snuffkin his workshop.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.040
But you know he won't let us in.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.040
I've tried before.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.040
Oh, yes, he will today.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.040
I promise.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.040
What?

14:08.040 --> 14:11.040
You mean Snorkel shows his flying ship at last?

14:11.040 --> 14:12.040
Yes, he said.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.040
Has he really finished it then?

14:15.040 --> 14:16.040
No, not yet.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.040
There's still a lot of work to do on him.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.040
Then I wonder why he's letting us see it.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.040
He's always refused before.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.040
What's made him change his mind?

14:24.040 --> 14:26.040
But I asked him this time.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.040
I said I wanted to show it to you.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.040
It just needed a woman's touch.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.040
What did you say to him?

14:31.040 --> 14:33.040
First, he said absolutely not.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.040
But when I told him how ill you were in that,

14:35.040 --> 14:37.040
you probably wouldn't be with us much longer.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.040
He gave in and said we could see it.

14:39.040 --> 14:42.040
Just you and me have claimed not that it'll snorke maiden.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.040
Oh, good.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.040
Because sometimes some people are very depressed

14:45.040 --> 14:46.040
and just lying bad.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.040
They've done something bad.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.040
Oh, stop it snorke maiden.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.040
Don't say things like that.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.040
I'm only trying to cheer you up.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.040
So remember, don't tell us all.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.040
No one else must know anything about it.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.040
Okay.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.040
Let's go.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.040
No.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.040
Oh, little Mai.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.040
Little Mai.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.040
Trouble.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.040
Big Trouble.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.040
We must fool her.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.040
Yes, but how?

15:32.040 --> 15:33.040
What can we do?

15:34.040 --> 15:36.040
I know what we'll do.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.040
What?

15:37.040 --> 15:38.040
Quick, Moomin.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.040
You just agree with everything I say snorke maiden.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.040
Oh.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.040
I thought you were in bad Moomin.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.040
No, we're going to see snorke.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.040
Yes.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.040
Really?

15:48.040 --> 15:49.040
Yes, he needs to clear a runway

15:49.040 --> 15:51.040
for when the flying ship is finished.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.040
We're going to help him do it.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.040
That's all.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.040
Yes.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.040
Are you really, Moomin?

15:55.040 --> 15:56.040
You got out of bad to do that.

15:56.040 --> 16:00.040
I'm afraid I find it very strange that snorke is asked to go along

16:00.040 --> 16:03.040
and help him cut down bushes and dig up roots and things.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.040
You might have noticed I'm not a complete fool.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.040
But it's true, little Mai.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.040
Oh, yes.

16:08.040 --> 16:10.040
Well, at least you could have invented a better lie.

16:10.040 --> 16:14.040
You must think I'm pretty stupid to believe a pathetic story like that.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.040
But it's the truth.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.040
And we need your help.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.040
Yeah.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.040
Don't bother, don't bother.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.040
I don't want to hear anymore.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.040
I think it's very sad that you have to pretend.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.040
You're trying to hide something from me

16:25.040 --> 16:28.040
and I'm not interested in what sort of sneaky underhanded thing it is.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.040
But little Mai.

16:29.040 --> 16:32.040
No, but, and anyway, I'm a little too busy at the moment

16:32.040 --> 16:34.040
to take any notice of what's going on.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.040
Goodbye.

16:35.040 --> 16:38.040
Come on.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.040
Phew, that was close.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.040
Yeah.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.040
Ha, think, thank you.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.040
Keep a secret from me, do they?

17:02.040 --> 17:03.040
Are you alone?

17:03.040 --> 17:04.040
Of course we are.

17:04.040 --> 17:07.040
I promised, didn't I?

17:07.040 --> 17:10.040
Come in, then.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.040
Wow.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.040
It's nearly ready, isn't it?

17:27.040 --> 17:29.040
Oh, no, there's a lot more to do.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.040
The machine isn't half finished yet.

17:31.040 --> 17:34.040
And as you can see, there's a lot to do on the ship itself

17:34.040 --> 17:37.040
but I'm getting there slowly.

17:37.040 --> 17:41.040
I never thought it would be so fantastic, smork.

17:41.040 --> 17:46.040
Well, I suppose you could say the design wasn't a complete failure.

17:46.040 --> 17:49.040
I'm quite sure it'll fly beautifully.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.040
Oh, thank you.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.040
Do you really think it will, woman?

17:53.040 --> 17:55.040
I can see it now.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.040
High up in the air, dodging in and out of the clouds,

17:58.040 --> 18:00.040
way up above the world.

18:00.040 --> 18:03.040
Well, I'm glad to see that you're so perceptive and quite right.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.040
Oh, how very thoughtful of me.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.040
Shouldn't you sit down and rest?

18:07.040 --> 18:09.040
Do you know your illness?

18:09.040 --> 18:11.040
It doesn't help to get too excited.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.040
Ha, I shouldn't worry, smork.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.040
There's nothing wrong with him.

18:16.040 --> 18:19.040
Oh, little my, how did you get in here?

18:19.040 --> 18:21.040
Throw that door.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.040
But I always keep it.

18:22.040 --> 18:25.040
Oh, oh, oh, no.

18:25.040 --> 18:28.040
I must have forgotten to lock it.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.040
And it's a bit late to do it now, isn't it?

18:31.040 --> 18:32.040
But don't worry.

18:32.040 --> 18:35.040
If I wanted to get in, I'd get in locks or no locks.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.040
Oh, you lied to us, little my.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.040
Of course, but so did you.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.040
Telling me that stupid story.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.040
Now we're even, right?

18:42.040 --> 18:44.040
Now, listen, little my.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.040
Don't ever tell anybody what you see over here.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.040
All right.

18:48.040 --> 18:53.040
This invention contains so many outstanding new features

18:53.040 --> 18:57.040
it is difficult to know where to begin.

18:57.040 --> 19:00.040
But let me start with the most exciting part

19:00.040 --> 19:03.040
of the whole construction.

19:07.040 --> 19:12.040
It could go as a dream or rather the concept of a dream

19:12.040 --> 19:17.040
thrilling, beautiful, impossible, dangerous.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.040
Can you take the ship down, movement?

19:30.040 --> 19:33.040
I'd like you to land at that side of the lake.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.040
Oh, why do you want to get off?

19:35.040 --> 19:38.040
Aren't you having fun flying about up here?

19:38.040 --> 19:40.040
I want to be on my own.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.040
Oh, please stay here.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.040
I'll let you steer.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.040
I'll be there.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.040
I'll be there.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.040
I'll be there.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.040
I'll be there.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.040
I'll be there.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.040
I'll be there.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.040
I'll be there.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.040
I'll be there.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.040
I'll be there.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.040
I'll be there.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.040
Oh, please stay here.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.040
I'll let you steer if you want.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.040
No, really, movement, please.

20:00.040 --> 20:02.040
Bye now.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.040
No!

20:07.040 --> 20:09.040
Snuff me!

20:14.040 --> 20:18.040
Oh, oh, oh.

20:25.040 --> 20:29.040
So long then, movement, my friend.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.040
I'll see you again next year.

20:31.040 --> 20:34.040
The first day of spring.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.040
I'll see you again next year.

20:57.040 --> 21:00.040
Bye!

21:00.040 --> 21:03.040
Goodbye, then, Snuffkin.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.040
Goodbye, then, Snuffkin!

21:21.040 --> 21:23.040
Off for the winter, Asian Nafkin?

21:23.040 --> 21:25.360
Yes, goodbye, Mr. Hemmielin.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.920
We'll be seeing you in the spring.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.400
Yes, when the snows are gone.

21:36.800 --> 21:41.280
Oh, to be young and follow the sun wherever it goes.

21:53.840 --> 21:57.520
And so the snow fell and winter came to Moomin Valley.

21:57.520 --> 22:02.160
And in Moomin's heart, Snuffkin and the spring seemed a long, long way away.

22:05.760 --> 22:11.760
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

22:12.720 --> 22:19.440
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.840
They're always happy and always at play.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.440
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:27.440 --> 22:31.040
The movements.

22:31.040 --> 22:35.040
The movements.

22:35.040 --> 22:41.440
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

22:42.240 --> 22:49.040
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:49.840 --> 22:53.200
They're always happy and always at play.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.800
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:56.800 --> 23:00.640
The movements.

23:00.640 --> 23:04.240
The movements.

23:04.240 --> 23:10.240
The movements.
