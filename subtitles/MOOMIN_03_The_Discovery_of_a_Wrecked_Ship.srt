32
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,920
a leaf boat look it sails on the river just like a real one

33
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,920
I bet it goes all the way down to the sea and maybe even to some foreign lands

34
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,920
gosh snuffkin I'd like to do that one day let's go then shall we little my wanted to come

35
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:37,920

36
00:05:37,920 --> 00:06:03,920
I'm not climbing up there well I am wouldn't you like to keep me company instead look

37
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,720
there's a cave just a little bit further along this path why don't you two girls wait for a

38
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,560
sec we won't be long but if you can walk to it why on earth climb to it difficult for a girl to

39
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,920
understand well I think boys are difficult to understand we're not sure we can reach it from above

40
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:28,080
well we'll soon find out are you coming with a sniff oh I think I'll guard the rear protect the

44
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:18,320
what I don't like yes exactly a place with no one living in it is really scary I think we must be

45
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:25,000
right above the cave here maybe I can't find a hole though let's look a bit more over that way moving

00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,040
you can't scare me like that no one lives here who want to live here anyway it's dark and cold

56
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,840

64
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:33,800
movement what's happened talk to me movement are you all right oh I don't know I think so

65
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,240
my bottom's a little bit sore though I'm sure I heard somebody scream just now well the

66
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,880
hamilin was down here having a nap the hamilin if this is another of your games movement I don't like

67
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,920
Mr. Hamilin we were climbing down from the top we didn't know you were asleep that's not quite right

68
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,600
I wasn't asleep I wasn't at all comfortable you know well what were you doing here then well

69
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,080
to tell you the truth I really haven't been quite myself lately you haven't lost any more rare

70
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:10,760
stabs have you Mr. Hamilin on the contrary movement I have them all even the rarest every single one

71
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:18,840
then what's wrong that's good isn't it I mean my collection is complete I know one in the

72
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:25,240
world has a better stamp collection than you have Mr. Hamilin no of course not mine is perfect there

73
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,560
isn't a stamp I haven't got rare ones old ones misprinted ones I have them all I still don't

74
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,720
understand there's no challenge nothing to search for you're too young and you don't collect stamps

75
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:46,200
oh dear me dear me I'm beginning to understand he's not a collector anymore he's got all the stamps

76
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:53,000
he could ever want that's the trouble it's not half as much fun that's why you're sad isn't it Mr.

77
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Hamilin yes it is no fun no fun at all now I understand I can see why you're upset and me falling

78
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,400
on top of you like that didn't really help did it not exactly moment look who was taking a

79
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:18,680
nap in the cave oh it's you Mr. Hamilin so it must have been his snoring that we heard what a noise

80
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:25,320
he was making I'd never ever snore you certainly do

81
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:42,360
Robbys look if you promise not to tell anyone I'll take you to see something very special what is it

82
00:12:42,360 --> 00:13:02,200
I think it could be repaired of course it could easy but you know you can't always tell the keel

83
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:08,280
doesn't look too good yes we could take it out to see a no time the sales got holes in it hey I

84
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:16,760
can't find any owners you can paddle all steer look out friends it's going over

85
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,200
hey hang on everybody

86
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:38,440
I've lost my confidence and it makes me feel very unhappy well it can happen to anyone you know

87
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:46,120
even to you well not much of course lucky you I just don't know what to do how can I get it back

88
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:53,240
there must be a way it's hard to say everybody's different but with me it just happens

89
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:03,320
I don't think I'll ever invent anything again perhaps I'll have a break from my memoirs too

90
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,440
tea time oh dear what's the matter with you too you look a bit down in the dance you know I might

91
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:26,120
have been a bit overconfident me too I think there's no need to yell we can hear you watch

92
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:33,480
the matter sniff we found a boat on the beach coming have a look a shipwreck washed up on the

93
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,680
shore it's not a wreck and it's got a white sail oh we're going to repair it and then it'll be ours

94
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,840
all right I'm coming come on snort let's take a look at this boat it could be just the thing

95
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:53,160
to cheer us both up so it's got a sail a white sail you say that could be extremely interesting

96
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:04,680
hmm it's a sturdy little craft is nicely built well designed she's abandoned so does that we can keep her

97
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,960
well it seems to be in pretty good condition except for the hole in the bottom you know maybe

98
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:22,200
that's why she was abandoned here you could be right stuff can finders keepers you guys of course it

99
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,160
makes it our boat you'd have to wait to see if anyone claims it first little mine what shall we do

100
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:34,680
then papa well first things first we must repair the hole and then tire up securely in case there's a

101
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:44,840
storm absolutely then if the owner comes we are to give her back to him mine you might know she's here

102
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,600
so what are we going to do when we've repaired her oh it's bad for boats not to be yours don't we

103
00:15:52,600 --> 00:16:04,200
could sail the seven seas I'd be happy just to explore around here don't worry snort maiden if we

104
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:12,120
get big waves we can sail between them isn't that right moment papa well in a way now come on let's

105
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:20,680
get to work how about you snort will you help us yes of course can I do anything for you moment papa

106
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,960
yes if you'd like to Mr. Himmelon well I'm afraid I'm not much of a builder but if there is

107
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:33,800
something I could do well let's get her out of the water first shall we and we'll need some

108
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:42,280
big logs to go under her I think ten should be enough I'll be so let's go prime she'll need to

109
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:49,800
be safe to work on so we'll want something strong to keep her upright as well and lots of tools

110
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,160
now go home and get some and I think we'll need a bucket and a shovel or I'll come with you

111
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,320
help you choose yes you go I'll stay and keep guard in case the owner comes back

112
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:33,480
sleep well man the top cells what

113
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:52,680

114
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:59,880
hard today I can't wait until the boat's ready and we can sail off somewhere my dear will go anywhere
