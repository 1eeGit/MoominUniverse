1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They're for you on your TV.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm not sure.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,640
I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. with me, they're for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:37,280
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:01:47,000

Where are you, Moomin? It's Nork Maiden!

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The rhino and the tigers that stinky set free from the zoo are now living in the jungle

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that has grown up around Moomin house and have settled into the restful life of Moomin Valley.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hey, have you seen Moomin?

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No, you haven't seen him all evening.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hmm.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I wonder where they got to.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Meanwhile, Moomin and Snorkmaiden chased by the snake

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and are swimming as fast as they can out to sea.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I can't swim another.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Soon most noteworthy you must.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hey! Hey you there! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, The hippos reported missing from the zoo lately. Just a bit further, Snorke made it.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We made it.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I didn't know hippos could climb so well.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, thank you so much.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There was a huge snake chasing us.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,439
Yes, we saw you were lucky we came along when we did.

29
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:09,080
Thank you for your help. Who's ship is this?

30
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,840
ours. We're from the zoo.

31
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
The zoo?

32
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,080
Oh, you've got one of the crocodiles.

33
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,639
Yes, and a lot of trouble he gave us as well.

34
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,520
There's another one around here somewhere. We saw them.

35
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,879
Yes, we know there is, but we haven't been able to find him yet.

36
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,000
Oh, boy. I wish they'd come as quietly as you hippos did.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hippos? Hippos?

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Which do you from? I bet they'd pay well to get you back.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Now look here, I'm a Mormon, not a hippo.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Are you saying that I look like a hippo?

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, perhaps they don't look exactly like hippos.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No, but they're close enough, Captain.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,939
I'm sure they've escaped from Azoo somewhere, though.

44
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:47,939
Yes, sir.

45
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,139
We haven't escaped from anywhere, certainly not Azoo.

46
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:53,340
We live in Moomin Valley. We're Moomin's.

47
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,180
It's all right, Snork Maiden. I'll not be taken for a hippo.

48
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,780
Come on, let's run for it.

49
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,479
Hey, wait. There's a nice cozy cage already for ya.

50
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,780
Hurry, Snork Maiden.

51
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,379
Ask to them.

52
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,560
Stop them now. Don't let them get away.

53
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,400
Where are we going, Mumin?

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,000
Now to the sea.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,800
Quickly, man, lower the light boat.

56
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,800
If they're not going to put us in any zoo.

57
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,000
Why did you come back? I thought you were on the boat.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh no! Don't worry, I never read anything when I'm not swimming.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Are you sure? I'm sure I know where's this ship.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh, they're catching up with us. They want to put us in a cage and take us to the zoo.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Me too, I expect. They're always trying to get me.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They've got one of the crocodiles. Oh, did they? They were my friends. Right. Hang on to me, I expect. They're always trying to get me. They've got one of the crocodiles.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, did they? They were my friends.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Right. Hang on to me, you two.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,500
I'm certainly not going back to any zoo.

66
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,000
Never, let's go.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh no!

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hold on tight.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Come back! You horrible rascal! Come back!

70
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,000
Moments been caught by a big snake. Yes, Mama snorked maiden as well.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,500
Dear stinky that's not true is it?

72
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,000
I wish people wouldn't realize that I almost never lie. I'm sorry about them, but I thought I'd better tell you.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, there aren't any snakes that big in Momen Valley.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,459
There are tigers here right there. Well, there's big snakes too.

75
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:28,040
You brought the snake here, didn't you?

76
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,839
Papa, I'm not saying that I believe him, but I think we'd better look for them just to be on the safe side, don't you?

77
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:38,379
Okay, don't believe me. I told you so my conscience is clear.

78
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,959
We're exactly to the snake attack them, Stiggy.

79
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,000
Down in the swamp by the sea.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,459
Let's go, mama.

81
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,279
I'll come with you. No, you'd better stay little my until

82
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,399
I'm moving where we've gone if he comes back. He'll only worry if there's no one here.

83
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,040
And stinky, you show us where to go.

84
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Big friend, please come in as much of you as you like. Stinky just told us that you and Snorkman

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
had been caught by a big snake, so we...

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Where are you going, Stinky?

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
She did chase us at first, then we managed to get on a boat,

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
but they wanted to put us in a cage,

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
so we jumped back in the sea, met the snake again,

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
then they tried to catch her too,

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
so she helped us to get away, and now she's our friend.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Who are they?

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,459
Men from the zoo.

94
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:50,660
They've come to recapture all the animals and take them away from the jungle and put them in cages again.

95
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,860
Nice.

96
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,860
Secondly, don't want to go back to the zoo.

97
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,360
Papa, we've got to protect our friends.

98
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,860
Yes, we have.

99
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,500
I'm sure that the tigers and that nice rhino don't want to go back even.

100
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Oh, of course they don't.

101
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,439
They want to be free and live again our jungle. Why don't you go and explore it? I'm sure it'll to go back even. Oh, of course I don't. They want to be free and let begin our jungle.

102
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,040
Why don't you go and explore it?

103
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sure it'll be just like home.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,079
And if you see the zoo people, you can come back here,

105
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,079
cut you.

106
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm sure you'll like it here, Mrs. Snake.

107
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,600
Yes, I'm sure I will.

108
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,839
Come on, I'll show you the jungle.

109
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,839
Eh.

110
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,360
I'm so relieved that you're both all right at home.

111
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,920
So are we, Mama, but there's something we haven't told you.

112
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,199
Yes, they thought we were hippopotamuses.

113
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,040
What?

114
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,879
Who did?

115
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,480
They need their eyes, Destin.

116
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,079
The men from the zoo.

117
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,959
They thought we had escaped from another zoo,

118
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:48,639
and we're trying to catch us, and they nearly succeeded. Now, a rude, well not at all like hippos, the cheek of it.

119
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,920
So these men were only trying to capture our new friends, but you and Snork Maiden as well.

120
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,120
And me and Papa if they'd known about us?

121
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,279
That's right, Mama.

122
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,339
There idiots.

123
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:03,360
Hippopotamuses don't wear aprons or right memoirs. That's really made me angry.

124
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,199
I bet they never faced the wrath of a movement papa before.

125
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,079
I want to see you wrap yourself round and choke somebody.

126
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,120
I know, how about the tiger?

127
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,439
He do.

128
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:20,240
I'd rather not, we became friends in the zoo.

129
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,439
Oh, I know, choke stinky, that would be much better.

130
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,560
Yes, my dewey did let us out of the zoo!

131
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,440
Well, you're a great disappointment to me. I let you out because I thought you'd attack the movements,

132
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,799
but you have tea with them instead. You're pathetic, you know that?

133
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,679
I'm sorry, but we were brought up in captivity, and we never had to hunt for our food.

134
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,919
All our meals are brought to us, you see.

135
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,480
But your tigers, what do you eat, them?

136
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,120
Well, we love cat food.

137
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,879
Cat food.

138
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,039
Oh, I don't believe it.

139
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:57,240
Yes, it's easy to chew, and it leaves our fur all sleep

140
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,919
and shiny.

141
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,759
We like the yellow tins with the black cat.

142
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,799
Don't we, honey?

143
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,279
Yes, it's our favorite.

144
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,000
You wouldn't happen to have any on you, would you?

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Mama! Pop-, quickly!

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
They're here! The zoo men are here!

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Get all the animals into the house first, you!

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Hurry, moment!

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay, Papa.

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The zoo men have come to get you!

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hurry, you'll be safe in the moment house.

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Quick as you can, Rhino, into the house.

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Go on.

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Now, Rhino, push him.

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm sorry. Oh, my God.

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Um, I don't think that's a good place to hide, Mrs. Snake.

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm afraid that doesn't look quite right, Tiger. I thought I might just look like a thick rug.

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll just lie here like a beautiful porcelain ornament.

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
They'll never know we're here, darling.

160
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, they'd never expect to find a rhino under there.

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's what I thought.

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Where are they?

163
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
They can't just have vanished into thin air.

164
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hmm. Look, up there!

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
In the chimney.

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So they're in there, are they? Papa! They've seen the snake! They're nearly here!

167
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Now I want you to calm down and be quiet, everyone.

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We won't let them take you away. I promise you they'll have a fight on the hands if they try.

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Teeth, please, my love.

170
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Of course, dear. We won't let them take you away. I promise you they'll have a fight on the hands if they try.

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Teeth, please, my love.

172
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
A poor steer.

173
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Hello?

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Hello? Hello. Hello. Hello.

175
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Hello.

176
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Hello.

177
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Having a picnic are you?

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's lovely day for you.

179
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Not at all. We're all here from the zoo, sir.

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh, are you on some sort of expedition?

181
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,039
Excuse me, but are you the owner of this house?

182
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:07,519
Yes, indeed I am. I'm movement pop-o.

183
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,720
Well, why could I do for you?

184
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,320
Why, you could send out the animals hiding in your house.

185
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,080
That'll do for a start.

186
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,120
Animals?

187
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,879
Oh, no. We have firm believers that they belong outside.

188
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,600
Sir, you can't see from where you are,

189
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,879
but I can assure you that there is a python

190
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,200
sticking its head out of your chimney. A python?

191
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,700
Yes, that's right.

192
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,399
No, it isn't.

193
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,700
It isn't.

194
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,700
No, it's my daughter.

195
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,700
She happens to look like a python.

196
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,200
Not all the time you understand.

197
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Right, come on, man.

198
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
We'll go and get the zoo's property.

199
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,700
No, you will not enter my house.

200
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,000
All right, well, you let the animals out. We won't have to.

201
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's up to you, sir.

202
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
There are no animals, and you won't enter my house.

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Now, wait a minute.

204
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I do believe, yes, you're one of those hippos, aren't you?

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I am not.

206
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm movement papa, and I am the owner of this house.

207
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
No, you're not.

208
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You're a hippopotamus.

209
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
How dare?

210
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
A hippo who owns a house, and it's also running an illegal zoo.

211
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,840
Break down the doors. You're not your hippopotamus, how dare? A hippo who owns a house, and it's also running in an illegal zoo!

212
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,440
Break down the doors!

213
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,039
Huh, that is against the law!

214
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,039
Oh it is, isn't?

215
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:16,279
Well, there's a nice cage winning for you as well, woman, pop a hippo.

216
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,840
I warn you, if you touch that door, you'll regret it.

217
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,639
Go, yeah?

218
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,759
Great boys, let's go in!

219
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:25,720
Charge!

220
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Oh!

221
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,559
Oh!

222
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,399
Oh!

223
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,240
Oh!

224
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,080
Oh!

225
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Oh!

226
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
Oh!

227
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
Oh!

228
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Oh!

229
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
Oh!

230
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Oh!

231
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Oh!

232
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
Oh!

233
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Oh!

234
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Oh!

235
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Oh!

236
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Oh!

237
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
Oh!

238
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
Oh!

239
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh! Oh! Oh! God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

240
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh, my God!

241
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh, my God!

242
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, my God!

243
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, my God!

244
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh, my God!

245
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh, my God!

246
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh, my God!

247
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh, my God!

248
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, my God!

249
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,500
Oh, my God! Oh, have you know that's willful destruction of property, my good man?

250
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,940
It's not willful, we're from the zoo. We gotta get in somehow.

251
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, have you, and can you be sure that there are zoo animals in there?

252
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,240
You just take a look up there at the chimney. That's all I'm sure.

253
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,279
Go on.

254
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,960
See that python's head sticking out?

255
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,000
That's all. I can't see a python's head sticking out? That's odd.

256
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I can't see a python's head.

257
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But there was a python's head up there, I saw it!

258
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Ugh, I can't breathe.

259
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Now you're listening to me, zoom in.

260
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Either you stop bothering my friends or I'll arrest you.

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Is that clear? Well, is it?

262
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,700
Yes, sir it is. but what about the zoo animals?

263
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,500
You heard the inspector now go away.

264
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Do you see that?

265
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,200
See what?

266
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
The hippopotamus.

267
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
What?

268
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
The hippopotamus.

269
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
He's a fellow's been hiding all our zoo animals.

270
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,700
We got a nice cage lined up for him as well inspector.

271
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Oh so that's your plan, is it?

272
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,200
Ha, they want to take them all.

273
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Moomin's, Nork, Me, Mama, and Papa.

274
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,120
Hmm, the criminal conspiracy.

275
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,200
Conspiracy?

276
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,679
It would probably be called kidnapping.

277
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,759
Once you can't kidnap a hippo?

278
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,759
That's a movement!

279
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,679
It could be white slavery, though.

280
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,320
I'm sure I could add incitement to riot to the list.

281
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,480
Now, I hate paperwork, so I'll tell you one.

282
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,000
If you're gone within 10 minutes, I won't arrest you.

283
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,519
Why don't you put them in the deepest dungeon, Inspector?

284
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,919
The one with all the rats and spiders and scorpions

285
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,159
that'll teach them to put mullens and cages.

286
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,919
That's a good idea, little mind.

287
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,360
They like animals.

288
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,840
I'll start counting now.

289
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,120
One, two, three.

290
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,559
Get around men quickly.

291
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,000
We'll have to think quickly on this one, men.

292
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,500
Come on now, does anybody have any smart ideas?

293
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Come on, we're running out of time!

294
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
One minute!

295
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Look guys, we're gonna figure something out right now!

296
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Ready and look!

297
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
One minute, thirty seconds!

298
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Two minutes!

299
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,500
Three minutes, thirty seconds!

300
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Look!

301
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,360
Leave us alone, way we're conferring.

302
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,879
Alright, six minutes and fifty seconds.

303
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,080
Time's up.

304
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,240
You're cheating.

305
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,000
The police don't cheat, and now you've got...

306
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,240
Nine minutes and thirty seconds.

307
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,679
How about that?

308
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,840
Nine minutes, fifty bucks? I give up!

309
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,360
Everybody beat it!

310
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,039
But we're still discussing it.

311
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,879
No, we're not. We're getting out.

312
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:27,000
Look, everyone, the zoom in, they're running off.

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Great.

314
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You've got to come and see this, Mama.

315
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No, it's $50.5 seconds.

316
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And don't come back. We'll be the dungeon for you.

317
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And I make that 10 minutes up to you.

318
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You saved his little mind.

319
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It was really clever of you to fetch the inspector.

320
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, there were too many of them for me to fight.

321
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Okay, everyone, keep the money out!

322
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh, oh, oh, yeah!

323
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And so everyone was saved,

324
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and eventually they all came out of the house

325
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
to go and have fun in the jungle again.

326
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
As long as the warm weather lasted,

327
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,599
there were plenty of things to do, but one day the weather changed,

328
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,799
and cold winds blew down Moomin Valley.

329
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,400
Ugh, it feels like autumn has arrived.

330
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,599
The jungle won't like the cold weather.

331
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,200
Do you think it will die, Mama?

332
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm afraid it will, little my.

333
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,500
It grew very quickly,

334
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,000
so perhaps it will go the same way.

335
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And it did. The whole jungle with it and died in just one night.

336
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I think I've done a cold coming, Mama.

337
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm sorry, I can't get the house any hotter.

338
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,039
I missed the zoo, at least it was warm now. Yes, this cold is awful

339
00:17:47,440 --> 00:18:25,000
It would warm them up if we weren't the dead jungle Now they're happy again. But for how long? Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys.

340
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's cold again.

341
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It was warm in our cages.

342
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What are you afraid here?

343
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yes, free to have pneumonia.

344
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spending the winter here.

345
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And so all the animals decided to return to the zoo.

346
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spending the winter here.

347
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And so all the animals decided to return to the zoo.

348
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Perhaps we'll like to come back next summer, Mrs. Snake.

349
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I like that when it's warmer.

350
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Hey, look, the animals are on their way back!

351
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Oh, Ray! That wonderful! Oh, it's good to see you. Hey look the animals are on their way back! Alright!

352
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That wonderful!

353
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh it's good to see you!

354
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You don't know how much we missed you!

355
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh good!

356
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Gosh!

357
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Welcome back Rhino O'Fallets!

358
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's good to see you!

359
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Come on now!

360
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Get back to your cages quickly!

361
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
We've been keeping them nice and warm for you!

362
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Go on off your go now!

363
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You look alright but I'm sure you must all be starving.

364
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We'll do you a special meal tonight, alright?

365
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Ah, the hippos too!

366
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
For the last time, we're movements, not hippos.

367
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You must be cold as well. We'll warm up a cage for you. It'll be nice and cozy there.

368
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
No. No, it just came to send the animals off.

369
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Hey, get a cage ready for the hippos. Well, you're nice and warm.

370
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,119
At the risk of sounding repetitive, we are movements.

371
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,720
Don't be ridiculous, you mullet here.

372
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,319
But we're nothing like hippos.

373
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,920
We know you're not purebred, but the public will never be able to tell.

374
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,799
Do we have to stay here forever, Papa?

375
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:08,000
Of course not, Momen. Don't worry, I'll think of something.

376
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You will, won't you? Have you got any ideas?

377
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Well, not yet, but I am a writer, you know.

378
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Don't cry, Snorth maiden. I'm sure there won't be only, hey, to eat.

379
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,519
I don't mind as long as we're

380
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:31,880
together but what if they put us in separate cages? Oh! That would be awful. They wouldn't

381
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,839
do that. Well perhaps the inspector will come looking for us. When he realizes that

382
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:43,400
we've gone as well as the animals he'll bring the full power of the Lord to bear on them.

383
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,359
Oh look there's someone coming.

384
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,359
It's Snoughkin! And Hamulun! And a little Mai! Snoughkin!

385
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,240
Hi, Moomin. Don't worry. We'll have you guys out in just a minute.

386
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,640
Please come out.

387
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,539
Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to let you out.

388
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:08,779
I'm in charge of this zoo.

389
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:11,299
I'm afraid it was quite an understandable mistake,

390
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:13,579
but please accept this token of apology

391
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:14,980
from the Board of Trustees.

392
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,980
Here you are, madam.

393
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,059
Mr. Hemmielin and I went to the Royal Academy of Science

394
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:22,299
just to sort all this out.

395
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:24,059
We've been given a letter from the President

396
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,000
stating that you are not hippos.

397
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,079
Mr. Hamillon's scientific background helped persuade him.

398
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,000
So you can all come home now.

399
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,599
Well, it just goes to show you must never judge

400
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,079
by appearances alone.

401
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,960
Mama.

402
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,799
Yes, Papa?

403
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,720
Do you think I should grow a beard?

404
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:52,599
No, Papa. Do you think I should grow a beard? No, Papa.

405
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:58,160
And so autumn came to Moomin Valley, a new season with different weather and different

406
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:12,000
pleasures. They love the laughter and they love the living the moments

407
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the moments

408
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
They're always happy and always at play The movements are having fun day after day

409
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The movements

410
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The movements

411
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
They love the laughter and they love the living

412
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The movements

413
00:22:42,000 --> 00:23:10,000
They're leaving and sharing and caring The moon, the moment
