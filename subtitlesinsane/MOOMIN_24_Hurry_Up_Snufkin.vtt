Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come. Come on and sit down here with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:01:58.200

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:08.319
is awake and enjoying the sunshine of the flowers. Everyone that is except for Mumin was in bed with a terrible cold.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.319
Ha, ha, ha.

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:24.719
Oh, dear, Mumin, that's a nasty cough.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.000
My throat is very sore.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.479
This will help soothe it.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:31.319
It's one of grandma's best potions.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.719
Yeah, it's hard.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:36.719
Never mind.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.520
Nice tasting medicines don't always work as well.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.639
I wanted to go out, it's spring.

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.379
I know dear, but you'd catch pneumonia or something.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.379
Oh, Mama.

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.379
Mm-hmm.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.719
Does anyone know why Snuffkin hasn't come back yet?

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:55.719
No.

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:00.560
Perhaps Spring came earlier this year and he wasn't ready.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.000
Snuffkin had always come back to Moonomin Valley on the very first day of spring.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But not this year.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Snuffkin.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.379
I'm Moomin Papa. Is Moomin any better? No, I I'm afraid not he's still got a nasty

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.039
car I go up and see him no you'd better not you might catch it

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:39.680
Papa's right sniffing you know how poorly you get when you're ill it's best not

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.419
to take the risk I should think he'll be up and about before very long. Yes, it's better to be safe than sorry.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.199
Moments shouldn't have gone out in the winter, should he, Mama?

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.560
No, but he couldn't go back to sleep.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.219
Snow would have that effect on anyone.

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:59.360
I knew little Mai was out in the cold with him, and look at her.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.199
She seems healthy enough.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:06.000
I'll take these flowers to moon later.. Little mice too small to catch a cold.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
This is boring! I can't believe that movement sick.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And Snuffkin's not back either.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I sure wonder what's happened to him.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I bet you moment gets better as soon as Snuffkin arrives in moment valley.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I'm not going to be able to do that.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I'm not going to be able to do that.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I'm not going to be able to do that.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I'm not going to be able to do that. I sure wonder what's happened to him.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I bet you, Momen gets better as soon as Snuffkin arrives in Momen Valley.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
He's never been this late coming back before.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Perhaps he's got fed up with you guys.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Impossible. He's very fond of me.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
He's told me so lots of times.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
He likes Momen too, of course.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
He might have been captured by a highwayman.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Let's go and look for him.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
The highwayman?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
First napkin, silly.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
He's got to come back so a moment will get better.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
We must find him.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
But where do we look, Snork Maiden?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
In the south.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
It's a big place. He could be anywhere.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Well, I don't care how big it is. I'm going anyway.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
You're being silly.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
No, I'm not. I don't think your brother will like it'm going anyway. You're being silly. No, I'm not.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I don't think your brother will like it.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
In fact, I know he won't.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Have you gone completely bananas?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
No, I haven't.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And you'll just have to make your own muffins.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
There's more to food than muffins.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I was speaking figuratively.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Anyway, I'm going to your brother

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and nothing you can do or say will stop me.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.199
It's for Mumin.

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.800
That's a sort of hair-brain scheme that could only have been dreamed up by you.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.399
What good will it do? You don't even know where he is.

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:35.399
It is not. Mumin is pining for Snuffkin.

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:38.600
Rubbish. Men don't pine for their friends.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.000
If he isn't back yet, then he isn't coming.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And if he isn't going to come, what's the point of looking for him?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.160
You won't find him anyway.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.800
He will come when he knows that Moon is sick.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.600
Black males just like a sister.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.879
Something done for love could never be black male.

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.040
Oh no, you're not going and that's fine.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.839
Look, why don't you and little Mai go by yourselves?

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:03.399
Oh, well I didn't really make a definite decision.

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:05.399
I just sort of said that I might come along.

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:07.480
But if Snort Maiden isn't going, then there

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.720
doesn't seem any point, does there?

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.360
And I'm not going because I think it's stupid and hair

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.120
brain, too.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.720
Snuff can come back soon.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.959
Not Snort Maiden.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.959
What do you say to that?

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:18.959
Oh.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:46.000
How is Momen feeling any better? He's asleep now, but the cough doesn't seem so bad. And his temperature? Still quite high. Hmm. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. Snark in! Snark in! Snark in!

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Snark in!

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Snark in!

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Snark in!

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Snark in!

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Snark in!

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Am I pleased to see you, Moonman?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
You look like you needed a lift.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
This magic cloud must be one of those we got from the Hobgoblins top hat.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
That's right. I had one of them away.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
What a good idea, Moomin. You are clever.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Well, it was so much fun the last time, wasn't it?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Hi, Moomin! Hi!

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Oh, look, Snuffkin. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I'm not going to do it.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I'm not going to do it.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I'm not going to do it.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I'm not going to do it.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I'm not going to do it.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I'm not going to do it.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I'm not going to do it.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I'm not going to do it.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I'm not going to do it.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. Oh. Not just a dream.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Snuff can.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Oh.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
You look blousy, moment.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Oh, thanks, stinky. You'd better keep away.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
There's no need bugs and things like that. Stay away from me.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
They're probably frightened of someone so healthy.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.240
Mama isn't letting anyone in here.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.079
It's very dull.

00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:28.439
You followed a bed or something?

00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:29.600
Yes, I did.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.279
I know.

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:32.080
You were dreaming, weren't you?

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.320
Unfortunately, yes.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.279
I know how you feel.

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:38.279
I have that dream a lot.

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:39.879
Oh.

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:43.039
You stand on a windowsill getting ready to break the glass

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.000
and inside there's diamonds.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And then moment you fall.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
It's not the same dream at all, stinky.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Snuffkin hasn't come back yet.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Have you heard anything from him? It's very late.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Ah, Snuffkin, um.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Huh, you know something, don't you?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
All I know is that he went away as usual last autumn and hasn't come back yet.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And then...

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Yes, what?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.200
Snark Maiden wanted to go looking for him

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.399
because she thinks that if Snork Kid comes back

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:11.500
he won't be sick anymore, but Snork with a letter.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.500
Snork Maiden?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.399
He snorked Maiden way!

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:20.399
Snork me!

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
You're not serious, are you? I feel perfectly alright. You look like that's warmed up if you ask me. Thanks a lot.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Now Stinky, tell me which way does Snuff can normally travel south?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Hey, are you going looking for him?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Yes, it's not really spring in Moomin Valley if he's not around.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
It's just not right somehow.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Okay, you're all as mad as each other.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
But you'll help me?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.440
I'll help you. Yes, it's not really spring in Moomin Valley if he's not around. It's just not right somehow.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.039
Okay, you're all as mad as each other.

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:51.980
But you'll help me. I've got to try and find him, Stinky.

00:09:52.139 --> 00:09:55.019
Yes, all right, but don't tell your parents I helped you.

00:09:55.179 --> 00:10:08.000
Don't worry, I'm fine. Here's your lunch, movement. How are you feeling?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Movement?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Papa, come here quickly.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Hmm.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Oh, sorry, stinky. Are you okay?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Oh, I'm fine.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Here's your lunch, movement. How are you feeling?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Movement? Papa, Mummenn. How are you feeling? Mummenn?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Papa, come here quickly!

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Mmm.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Oh, Papa, Mummenn's gone. He's not in his bed.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Not in his bed? Are you sure, Mama?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Of course I am. His room is empty and there's no sign of him.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Perhaps he's in one of the other rooms. Don't worry mama, I'll find him.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:56.000
You're home, Mumin! Mumin!

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Hi, you're Mumin, Papa!

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Oh, little Mai!

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
What's wrong? You look worried!

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
A moment's gone off somewhere.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
I expect you must have gone to look for Snaftkin.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Snaftkin?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Well, you know how crazy Moomin is about him.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Bits stupid if you ask me.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:45.000
But he's not well. He's got a fever. I'm sure this is the right way?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Of course I'm sure I live in this forest, don't I?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Why don't we miss each other somewhere?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Well if you think you might, don't go there and it's up to you.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
But I've got to...

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Moments!

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Oh, snort me, little.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Huh?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Huh?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Where are you taking him, Stinky?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
You can see he's not well.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I'm not taking him. He insisted on going. I came to look after him.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Is that really right, Boomin?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Yes, I wanted to find Snuffkin, so he'd come back.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Well, I was going to find him for you. Little mine's sniff were coming too, but they chickened out so I came on my own.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
What did Snork say about that? I bet he wasn't happy.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Oh, he made a big fuss and I just let him.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So you just walked out and came on your own?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Brothers, always think they can tell you what to do.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I just ignore him.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Did you tell your parents where you were?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Ah, no.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Did you put him up to this stinky? It's just a sort of thing you do.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
No, I did not.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
That's true, Snork Maiden.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I don't know how you did it stinky, but I know you and I know you're to blame and I don't think I won't find out.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
That's not fair, Snark Maiden. It was nothing to do with me at all.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Oh, he's right, Snark Maiden. He didn't want to show me the way, but I made him.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I'm taking you home.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Oh, but Snark Maiden. Look.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
No, buts. You're sick and you should be in bed and your parents must be very worried.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Look!

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Moving!

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It's Papa, it isn't that snorke behind him.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Yes it is.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Oh, it's time I wasn't here.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I'm glad you hadn't gone too far, Moomer. I might never have found you.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I'm very sorry, Papa.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
I have a feeling you're behind this stinky come on quickly out with it.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.600
Why doesn't anyone believe me it was moments I'd be I swear it was.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.600
It was Papa I wanted to find snuffkin.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.899
Are you alright moment?

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.899
Snork me.

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:42.899
Here we go again.

00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:46.639
Snork me what are you doing here I thought I told you not to go on this silly jump.

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:48.080
Well, I didn't say I wouldn't.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.679
Did I?

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.799
Listen to me, Snark.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.360
Oh, you're looking guilty, stinky.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.440
How did you persuade her to disobey me?

00:13:55.559 --> 00:13:56.960
See, I told you.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.840
You stay nice and warm in bed,

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.000
and I'll mix them of grandma's potion with honey for you.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
You'll have to be better soon because I have a feeling Snuffkin's on his way.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
My wish Snuffkin would hurry up then we could all get back to normal at last.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
My sentiment's exactly.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:31.039
So where is snuffkin well he's on his way back to woman valley but he's had a

00:14:31.039 --> 00:15:18.000
very long walk and is getting very tired now Poor Snuffkin. He's had a terrible cold as well. This feeling rather weak. Hello, I know you don't I?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:35.279
Oh yes, your snuffkin!

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Isn't that water still a little cold for that? You'd better come by the fire and keep warm or you'll catch cold. This is nice!

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Just think I'll be the one that's set by Snuffkin's fire.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And he told me to keep warm and that catch cold. Just Nick, I'll be the one that's that by Snuffkin's fire.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And he told me to keep warm and not catch cold.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Hmm, that's no big thing, little fella.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
It's a pretty chilly night out here.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Oh, it is.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I've heard so many stories about you from everybody.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And each year I try to watch you go past, but I've never been brave enough to talk to you before.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Stories from everybody.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.120
I don't know if I like that.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.200
In fact, I'm sure I don't.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.440
What's your name, little fella?

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.080
Oh, well, I haven't got one.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.519
I'm so small that nobody's ever asked me before.

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:38.559
I've always wanted to have a name, you know?

00:16:38.559 --> 00:16:40.240
And it was you who asked me.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.159
And I've actually met you and sat next to it.

00:16:42.159 --> 00:16:43.360
You're countifying.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.639
Oh, it's so wonderful.

00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:47.120
You don't know how happy it makes me meeting you like this.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.799
Aw, come on. You do go on a bit old fella. You just get warm now.

00:16:50.799 --> 00:16:55.120
Do you think Snuffkin? Oh, I don't know whether I should ask you. I don't want to offend you.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.879
Oh, well, why not? Yes, I will.

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:03.759
Perhaps you'd be kind enough to it. I mean, would it be too much trouble for you to think of a name for me?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
There. I've said it be too much trouble for you to think of a name for me? There. I've said it now.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Well choosing a name is important. I'd have to think carefully about that.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
But it will be easy for you. You know everything!

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Now listen to me. You can't look up to people too much if you want to be yourself. It's not right.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
But Snuffkin, you're so clever. You can do anything, anything at all. I know you can.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
I've always wanted to be free like you to do whatever I feel.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Oh, I'm sorry I'm talking too much. I want to listen to you too. All about your travels for a start.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I know you're on your way to the Moon Valley to see all your friends. The hedgehog told me the Moon

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
stayed out for most of the winter. Just waiting for you to come back.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.359
Now, isn't that wonderful?

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:49.359
What?

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:51.240
I'd love to have someone that missed me so much

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.279
they were miserable until I came back.

00:17:53.279 --> 00:17:56.759
You don't know how lucky you are that you're so special.

00:17:56.759 --> 00:17:58.599
Well, perhaps I'm not going there.

00:17:58.599 --> 00:18:00.839
I might have somewhere else to visit instead.

00:18:04.279 --> 00:18:08.000
Oh, moment will be very sad if you don't go back.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Yes, but you've got to have time to be on your own as well.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Of course you have, and I've taken up too much of yours now.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Wait, I think I'll be off.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Okay, thanks.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Goodbye, Snuffkin. Good night, little fella. Hey, wait a minute. What about your name?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
You remember it!

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Well, what do you think of TD Wu, my friend?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Yes, TD Wu.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
I'm not sure if you remember it.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
I'm not sure if you remember it.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
I'm not sure if you remember it.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
I'm not sure if you remember it.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
I'm not sure if you remember it. I'm not sure if you remember it. What about your name? You remembered! Well, what do you think of TDW, my friend?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Yes, TDW.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
It's nice and happy to start with, and then a little sadness.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
TDW.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
That's right. TDW.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
TDW.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
TDW.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:27.839
TDW! TD-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-Woo! T-T-Woo! T-T-W anyone a name. Yeah! I think I'll build a house and then I can put up a real name plate that says

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:28.839
TDWOO!

00:19:28.839 --> 00:19:32.519
Ah, good idea TDWOO. About what I said before.

00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:33.519
Huh?

00:19:33.519 --> 00:19:39.200
You know, not going back to Moomin Valley? Well I am. I've missed Moomin and all my friends.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.640
Oh, I didn't take that seriously. You just got upset at something I said. I'm afraid

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.000
that happens a lot. I guess I talked too much.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Maybe you do.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
I'll be going back to Moomin Valley a bit behind schedule, and this year's spring came along early too.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
But I suppose it's better late than never, as they say.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Moomin will be happy. Say hello to everyone from TDW.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.640
I will, and I'll tell them how it came about.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.839
That's where you keep your harmonica, isn't it, Snuffkin?

00:20:09.839 --> 00:20:11.599
It's really famous, you know?

00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:13.519
I didn't realize that.

00:20:13.519 --> 00:20:14.279
Do you know?

00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:16.279
I've never ever heard any music.

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:21.279
Really?

00:20:21.279 --> 00:20:22.599
What would you like me to play?

00:20:22.599 --> 00:20:23.640
Anything.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.720
Oh, I know.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:21:02.400
What about women's favorite? Oh

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
That's Smokin! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Oh!

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Oh!

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Oh!

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Oh!

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Oh!

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Oh!

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Oh!

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Oh!

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Oh!

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Oh!

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Oh!

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Oh!

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Oh!

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Oh!

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Oh!

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Oh!

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Oh!

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Oh!

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I'm not getting it. I'm not getting it. I'm not getting it.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
I'm not getting it.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
I'm not getting it.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
I'm not getting it.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
I'm not getting it.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I'm not getting it.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
I'm not getting it.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
I'm not getting it.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
I'm not getting it.
