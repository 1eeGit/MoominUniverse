    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Therefore you are your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:30.000
They are the movements, they are the movements,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.920
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly

00:00:36.920 --> 00:01:52.200
just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there was the movement, there was the movement, there was the movement, there was the movement La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la The weather was far too beautiful for a woman Papa to concentrate on writing his memoirs,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200
so he went for a walk instead.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.400
Good morning, Mr. Hamilton.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.480
Ah, a woman Papa.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.200
Have you found a new plan or something?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm afraid not, and I think I must have examined every single plant in Moomin Valley.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I know what you mean. There isn't a single person living here that I don't know.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Oh, yes, yes, quite.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Look, why don't you come over and have a cup of tea, Mr. Evelyn? Hmm? Isn't that moment a little, my?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Yes, I think it is.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Really, a moment, Papa, peeping into people's homes.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Oh, it's an empty house, Mr. Hemmellon.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Moment, what are you looking at?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Oh, hello, Papa. Nobody's lived in there for years. Somebody's just moved in.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Oh, really?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Let me have a look.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Oh, goodness.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
How tidy they are.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Perhaps the children will play with us.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Well, they might, but they seem a bit too well behaved for that.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I must have a closer look at them.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Me too, Mum and Papa, but I'm not going to be able to they might, but they seem a bit too well behaved for that.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I must have a closer look at them.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Me too, Moomin Papa, but the trouble is they never come outside the fence.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Well, in that case, we'll have to go in.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
How do we do that, Papa?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
We can't just walk in there.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
See, you want to borrow some sugar? That should do it.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Oh, Mr. Hamilton, where's your imagination?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Will you please lend me your magnifying glass?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But surely. Here it is.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Oh, that should do it.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
What are you going to do, Papa?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Now then, you all stay out here.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
My plan will only work if it looks as though I'm on my own.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Oh, but what is your plan, Papa?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I hope Papa knows what he's doing.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
They don't look that friendly to me. Me neither.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Mama, there's someone coming.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Oh! What do you want, my good man? Come on, tell me quickly. Do you hear me?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Hmm. Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I didn't think anyone lived here.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Well, we do know. You know we just moved in.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Really? Oh, do forgive me, madame. I certainly didn't mean to trespass.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Ah, so what are you doing here in the garden, man?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Researching the travel system of ants.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.279
I didn't know they had one.

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:48.759
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's fascinating.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.000
How they find their way and build their roads,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.680
and they're not here now, of course.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.160
But this is their main road.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.920
It's very quiet at the moment, but at busy times, it's packed.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.600
I'm afraid I can't see any main road.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.720
Oh, you would if you were an expert.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.399
Anyway, I'll point it out to you next time they're on the move.

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:09.199
If I'm in the vicinity, of course, but it's worth looking out for.

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.800
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.300
I'm your next door neighbor, though.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.800
We live quite a long way away.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.800
I'm Moomin.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.300
Ah! So you must be Moomin Papa, are you?

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.300
Ah, yes.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.300
That's me.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.800
Ha, ha, how did you know?

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.800
Ha, ha, ha.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.759
Did someone mention my name to you?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.560
We were told the moments were a bit unusual. Very nice, they said though.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.800
How very flattering, thank you.

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:37.279
And you're Mrs.

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:40.040
Billy John, mother and housewife.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.000
Well, it's an honor to meet you. Mrs. Philly John.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Well done, Papa. It looks like you found us some new friends to play with.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Oh, welcome, party.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Don't you think it's a good idea? We haven't had a party for ages, Mama.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But you hardly know them, and I've never even met them.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But, Mama, how can we show them that they're really welcome

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.199
and they could meet everyone at a party, couldn't they?

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.360
And I could take care of all the children.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.360
I know just what to do.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.120
Splendid moment.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.079
Ah, Mr. Hebblin, I know, moment papa.

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:17.079
You'd like me to do the fireworks.

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:18.800
It looks like we're throwing a party.

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:28.000
We'll have lots of pretty flowers. Just tell me what you want, mama, and we'll do it.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It's great! Those kids will just love it!

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:45.000
If they survive, mumen! It's great! Those kids will just love it!

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
If they survive, movement!

00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Now then, children! The movements are all a little bit odd, so behead properly!

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Yes, mother, we will!

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
They'll be here soon. Take this in, movement! Yes, mother, we will.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
They'll be here soon. Take this in, Mummett. Okay.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
The joke works really well.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Oh, good. I must try it.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Mmm, these look nice.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Oh, stiff. Leave them alone, will you?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Oh, all right. Just this one.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.240
Huh? Huh?

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.980
They're here.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.180
Come on, everybody.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.279
They'll soon be at the door.

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:32.139
Right.

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:33.439
Come on, children.

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:34.839
Help me with the flowers.

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:38.920
Oh, dear.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.079
Fireworks now are later on.

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:47.000
Oh, later on, I think you'll very hold finally. Welcome to Moomin House, Mrs. Philly John. It was very kind of you to invite us, Moomin Lama.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Come in, please, and make yourselves at home.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Oh, thank you all very much indeed.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.699
Welcome to Moomin Valley. Welcome to Moomin Valley. Welcome to Moomin Valley. Welcome to Moomin Valley. Welcome to Moomin Valley. Welcome to Moomin Valley. You're watching, Deed.

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:12.300
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.100
All in my hair. It looks very untidy, doesn't it, mother?

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.300
It's a surprise.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.500
They should have been rose buds,

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.199
but we couldn't find any at all.

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:23.500
Oh, yes.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.199
Dear, what a mess. Mrs. Mrs. Philly chunk let me introduce the

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:32.759
children. They all look different. Well yes only

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:39.639
movement is really ours the others are sort of I'm sure they'll all get on. Oh

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:45.840
I'm afraid my children do not play. They would much rather read or study.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.799
Oh, are you sure they've got to have some time for play?

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:50.559
I'm sure.

00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:57.360
Well, come into the dining room anyway.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.679
You can watch the others play.

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:01.759
Make sure the chairs are clean.

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:03.080
Yes, Mother, we will.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Won't you let them play at all?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
No, I will not.

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:17.000
Come on, everybody.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Wouldn't you like to have a go on our slide?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
No.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Hmm.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
You'd really enjoy it once you got going.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I know you would.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
No, thank you. No, no, not at all.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
No, definitely not.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And you're really quite sure, are you?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Yes.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I thought so.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Then we've got it all to ourselves.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Yahoo! No! No! No!

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
No!

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
No!

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
No!

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
No!

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
No!

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
No!

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
No!

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
No!

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
No!

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
No! No! Oh, and that's little May and sniff.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Your children seem very quiet, Mrs. Philly junk.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Good children are seen and not heard right here.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
That was one of mine.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And that was another.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Well, it sounds like they're having fun for once.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
To have a biscuit Mrs. Philly junk.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
They have an unusual taste.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I'd run out of flowers, so I used them.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Oh!

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Don't worry.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Move them a little bit after them.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Oh!

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Go on.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
It's your turn now.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Wee!

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Wee! Wee! Oh! Go on, it's your turn now.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Yay!

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Yay!

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Whoa!

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Oh, my children!

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Yay!

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Oh!

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Oh!

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Stop it, it's too dangerous.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
You might hurt yourself.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.159
Yay! Oh, come on! It's too dangerous. You might hurt yourself. I see. No!

00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:06.159
Ha ha!

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:09.960
Oh, come on! Stop it at once!

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.799
Now, don't you worry, Mrs. Villageunk.

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:14.720
I got ointment in my bag if I hurt themselves.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.480
But you'll hear mother.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.240
Ha ha ha ha!

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:27.000
Stop children! You hear me? We're going home now.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Stop it.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Oh, this is really hard for us to kill them.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:40.000
I think it's time for the glorious finale, Papa.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
I can't say I wasn't warned.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.320
Exposing them to this,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.279
Movement Valley is no place for proper children.

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:50.799
No place at all.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.600
Oh, dear, what's this?

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.799
There are fireworks in your honor.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:57.840
Fireworks?

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:14.720
I made them especially to welcome you.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.639
Goodbye! Come back soon!

00:12:18.919 --> 00:12:20.080
Yeah, welcome to the park! No, you will not!

00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:24.279
I don't think Mrs. Philly John can enjoy her party.

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:26.000
She's very lucky that I didn't think Mrs. Philly John can join her party. She's very lucky that I didn't bite her.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
She should have had a go on the slide.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I'm sure she would have loved it.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And then she wouldn't have shouted at her children.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Don't up, don't slide down, shoot sniff.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
They're too afraid of looking silly.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Whoa!

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Oh, oh.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Papa.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Oh, I'm very sorry, moment, but don't worry, I'll fix it.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It is nothing much broken.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
What happened, my dear?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Well, I thought it had been such a long time since I'd been on the slide that I'd have a go.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I didn't think I'd be too heavy for it.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I know. When we mend it, why don't we make it strong enough for me and Mama to play on as well?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
I think she'd like that.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
That's a good idea, Papa. But we want to use it too.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Well, that's a course. I just try it out. Now and again.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I want you to stay here while I'm out. What if somebody asks us to play? What do you mean? Play.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
I hope you're not thinking of the mommens, are you?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I don't want you mixing with those noisy children ever again.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
You hear me?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Where are you going, mother?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
To look for another house.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.059
It was a terrible mistake coming to Mumen Valley. again do you hear me where are you going mother to look for another house it

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:50.000
was a terrible mistake coming to move in valley

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:04.080
look there's Mrs. Philly drunk good afternoon please stay away from my

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.000
children but why?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
We thought they might like to come and have an adventure with us.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Oh, never mind. Let's go.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Hey, hang on a minute!

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Hey!

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Oh, your tar-sa! Yeah!

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Oh, no!

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Oh, no!

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I can't see!

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
It's too late for you now, Sniff!

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Oh, no, not the hungry crocodile at the bottom of the porch!

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
We should have brought the Philly Junks with us.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.200
But Moon and Mrs. Philly Junks... We need to look tall, her.

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:09.000
Have you been killed and eaten yet, Sniff?

00:15:09.399 --> 00:15:13.799
No, I fell on top of the crocodile and knocked him out, and then swam ashore.

00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:18.200
Sniff, but I thought you couldn't swim.

00:15:18.799 --> 00:15:20.399
On your own business.

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:29.000
Hey, that looks like the Philly Junks!

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Why don't they come over here? I bet their mother told them not to talk to us.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Huh? See if I care you!

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.960
Hey! What are you doing? Why aren't you playing with Mormon and the others?

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.440
I don't think they want to play with us.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.639
They didn't call for us when they went past.

00:15:56.639 --> 00:16:00.000
Stinky's arrived and wonder what he's doing here.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.960
I bet you it's no fun stuck in that garden.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.679
No, we'd rather be out here playing.

00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:08.559
Well, I know somewhere much better than moments.

00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:10.399
It's a great place to play.

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:11.200
Do you?

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.720
Yes, would I lie to you?

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.279
It's a bit of a way off, but it'll be really exciting

00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:18.000
and lots of fun so do you want to come or not.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.080
Well, it is a bit boring here.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.080
Yes, very.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.000
Do you really think they don't want to play with us?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Doesn't look like it.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Your brother's absolutely right.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
So come on if you're coming, because I can't wait.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
What stinky up, too?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I don't trust him. Okay, now this is the place I told you about. Good, isn't it? Now, if you hang on to that rope, you can swing over to the other side and back again. Don't worry, it's quite safe.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
That's great. I've never been anywhere like this.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
A bit frightening.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Without the thrill, where's the fun?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
You need a bit of danger to spice it up.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Gee, Willikers, it looks like the other side is higher than this side.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Yes, I bet it's all right. You just have to put your legs up. That's all.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.799
Who wants to go first?

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.599
I've got it. Why don't you all go together?

00:17:28.599 --> 00:17:29.440
What?

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.519
The three of us?

00:17:30.519 --> 00:17:33.799
See, this way it won't feel so scared, will you?

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:35.799
No, not together.

00:17:35.799 --> 00:17:38.720
Well, why don't you go one at a time then?

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.720
That way it's always more fun.

00:17:42.839 --> 00:17:44.279
Can you do it, stinky?

00:17:44.279 --> 00:17:47.119
Don't be silly. Of course I can. I do it all the time.

00:17:47.119 --> 00:17:52.720
One of the things I'm best at. Even if I do say so myself. So why don't you show us Stinky?

00:17:54.319 --> 00:17:59.680
Moonin! I didn't know you were such a rop swinger Stinky. I'm sure he didn't either.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:07.000
So this is your usual place, is it? Well, sort of.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
You know something? If you hadn't said that you'd done this lots of times,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
I wouldn't have believed that I could have done it myself.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Come on, Stinky, show us how you do it.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
If you go first, I'll be second.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
No, it's alright. You can go first, Mom.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
But I want to see how it's done. Then throw me the rope and I'll follow.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Now, tell the truth. You've never done it. Have you stinky?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Of course I've done it, stupid!

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Now come on, come on. Don't be such a spoiled sport.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
We're all here waiting to cheer you on.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.839
Alright, everybody. I give you the brave, evolved Tarzan Stinky.

00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:47.279
You watching?

00:18:47.279 --> 00:18:49.400
Are you ready, Stinky?

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.079
A big cheer, everyone!

00:18:51.079 --> 00:18:51.599
Ready?

00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:53.640
Yeah!

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.680
Oh, Stinky, my big brave here, oh, jump!

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.640
Well, go on, we're all waiting for you, Stinky.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.160
Come on, Stinky, show us how to jump.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.720
Come on, Stinky, come on, you can do it.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.720
Come on, you can do it.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.200
Jump! Stinky shorts out. Come on, Stinky! Come on, you can do it. You can do it. You can do it.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.200
Whoa!

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.200
Huh?

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.200
Huh?

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.200
Huh?

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.200
Huh?

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.200
Whoa!

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.200
Whoa!

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.000
Oh, so this is how you've done it lots of times before, is it?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Yes, the rope is the straw!

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
He was trying to fool you.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
It was a dangerous game, and he knew very well it couldn't be done.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
I did it!

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Now, why don't you come with us and play properly?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
You're gonna be tired, as long as you like!

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
And when you get tired, just let go of the rope!

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
All right, Steve?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Mama, take it!

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Yeah!

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
You can't just leave me here, you fuck!

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Uh, uh, innocent, fair please!

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Help! Don't leave me here!

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Woo!

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Woo! Woo! Woo!

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Woo!

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Woo! Yeah!

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
But Stinky was left on his own to decide whether to climb up the rope or drop into the river.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And the Phyllis-Jong children had more fun than they'd ever had before,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
but they didn't get home until very late in the evening.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Bye, we'll see you tomorrow.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.519
Okay, mommy. Okay, Moomin.

00:20:25.519 --> 00:20:26.599
Bye, Moomin.

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:28.720
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:34.920
Oh, my dear children, I told you to stand home.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.400
What earth have you been?

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.920
Where have you been?

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.559
With movement and the others.

00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:41.400
They kidnapped you, did they?

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.000
No, we've been playing with them.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.039
Well, you can just forget about the movements.

00:20:46.039 --> 00:20:48.539
We're moving out as soon as we possibly can.

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:50.279
Moving, mother?

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:52.240
Yes, right away from this valley,

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.819
this is no place for a spotless and well-ordered home.

00:20:56.819 --> 00:20:59.220
What's the matter?

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.259
No, we don't want to move.

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:02.619
Ah.

00:21:02.619 --> 00:21:04.460
We want to stay, mother.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.000
Oh!

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Muminhouse is nice and dusty.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
We want to stay in Mumin Valley forever.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Oh, please, mother. We love it here.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Oh, after all I've done for you children.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:22:05.000
And my experience children usually get what they want. What? And that was how Phila Junk and her three children became permanent residents of Mumen Valley.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
