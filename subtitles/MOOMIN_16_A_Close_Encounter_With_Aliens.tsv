0	20560	here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with
20560	32800	me here for you on your TV they are the movements they are the movements so come with me give me your hand
32800	41680	I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there with the
41680	56880	movements there was a movement there was a movement there was a movement
71760	74240	Ba ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba threat
74240	103680	With all the planets in outer space, there must be other forms of life different
103680	113280	that on earth. We don't know what they look like because no one from here has ever seen them.
119520	124480	However, we do know that they don't look like this because this is sniffed one of
124480	126480	women's friends.
154480	173280	So, it looks as though the rumor was right.
173280	176480	What rumor was that?
176480	180480	That we were about to be invaded by aliens from outer space.
180480	184480	Oh, dear, do you mean that thing that was chasing me might have been one of them?
184480	186480	Well, yes.
186480	188480	I thought they were just after me.
188480	192480	I wouldn't have thought you'd have been that important to them sniff,
192480	194480	but I suppose you never know, knew you.
196480	204480	It says here in this book that aliens from outer space are very civilized and peace-loving and would never want to invade us.
204480	206480	It seemed as though they're quite happy where they are.
206480	208480	I do, it's not a very scientific book.
208480	212480	Well, it was definitely attacking me, Mom and Papa, I know it was.
212480	216480	Well, it might have been a civilization from another planet sniff.
216480	218480	They were just hungry.
218480	224480	Huh? Well, the inspector told me that he thought we were being invaded by aliens, and he shouldn't know.
224480	226480	I'm sure he's exaggerating.
226480	228480	I wonder what they look like.
228480	232480	Why don't you come and help me in the garden?
232480	234480	You never know, we might see one.
234480	236480	Mama, wait for me!
250480	252480	Mama, what's that?
252480	254480	Well, I would say it's not a vegetable, that's for sure.
254480	256480	It looks like a flying saucer.
258480	260480	I wonder if there are any aliens in it.
260480	262480	They might be heard, Mama.
262480	264480	Let's have a look.
276480	278480	I think there's something there.
282480	284480	This looks odd. I wonder what it is.
284480	286480	It's a bit like a radio, isn't it?
286480	288480	Oh yeah, an alien radio.
288480	292480	Do you think there's anyone in there moving?
292480	296480	Anybody there?
296480	298480	It seems to have been deserted.
298480	302480	There's a funny noise coming from it.
302480	306480	Well, it doesn't look to me like it could fly again.
306480	308480	It could be repaired.
308480	310480	You'd need to know about flying saucers.
310480	312480	Papa could do it?
312480	316480	I don't think flying saucers should make that sort of noise.
316480	318480	Do you, woman?
318480	320480	I don't think so.
320480	322480	But I don't know very much about them.
322480	324480	It does seem a bit odd.
324480	328480	As if they've said it to be blown up so that no one would be able to steal it.
328480	330480	Because they want to keep the design a secret.
330480	332480	Do you think it will?
332480	334480	Oh!
334480	336480	I'm not sure, Mama.
336480	338480	But let's get away in case it does explode.
338480	340480	That's why it's empty.
340480	342480	It landed in the Asparagus patch.
342480	344480	I'll take the radio with me.
350480	352480	It won't be too long now, Mama.
352480	354480	No, it won't.
354480	356480	It won't be long.
360480	362480	It's vanished.
362480	364480	Less my soul.
364480	368480	Papa's book said they could be a very advanced life form.
370480	372480	There's nothing to show.
372480	374480	It was ever here.
374480	376480	Except the hole in the ground.
376480	378480	And this radio thing.
382480	384480	Hmm.
384480	386480	Is it a radio, Papa?
386480	388480	I don't know.
388480	390480	It looks a bit like one.
390480	394480	Let's try pressing one of these buttons.
394480	396480	The red one first, I think.
396480	398480	Oh!
412480	414480	Papa, where have you gone?
414480	416480	I'm right here.
416480	418480	I wonder what happens if I press this one.
418480	422480	Well, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't see you either, dear.
422480	424480	What?
426480	428480	Oh, I see.
432480	434480	So if you press the red button, you become invisible.
434480	436480	What a fascinating machine.
436480	438480	Papa, I think I'd rather see you, dear.
438480	440480	Well, of course you would.
440480	444480	Well, let's try the yellow one.
444480	446480	Can you see me now?
446480	448480	No, Papa.
448480	450480	Oh, that's hard.
450480	452480	Do you want me to try, Papa?
452480	454480	Please, Mama.
454480	456480	Oh, Papa.
456480	458480	That's a very dangerous machine.
458480	460480	I don't want to disappear ever again.
460480	462480	It's not a nice experience.
462480	464480	No, dear. I didn't like you vanishing like that.
464480	466480	Well, we must put it somewhere safe, Mama,
466480	468480	where the children can't find it.
468480	470480	Yes, dear.
470480	472480	Oh, Papa.
472480	474480	That's a very dangerous machine.
474480	476480	I don't want to disappear ever again.
476480	478480	It's not a nice experience.
478480	480480	No, dear. I didn't like you vanishing like that.
480480	482480	Even forgotten.
482480	484480	Mumon.
484480	486480	Snortmaiden, what an earth's the matter.
486480	488480	We found a strange creature.
488480	490480	Strange creature.
490480	492480	I think it's an alien.
492480	494480	Does it look like a jellyfish?
494480	496480	No, not at all.
496480	498480	Little mice keeping an eye on it.
498480	500480	C'mon!
500480	504480	Where are you going, Mumon, Papa?
504480	506480	Going me out.
506480	508480	What do you mean?
508480	509640	Moving, Mum and Papa.
509640	511440	Going me? Oh, no, Especial.
511440	512840	Moving, Mum, I'll hang on.
512840	515240	I've got a few questions for you.
515240	516640	Really, Inspector?
519480	521400	I was told that a flying saucer
521400	522840	had landed in your garden,
522840	525080	but all I can see is a big hole.
525080	526080	Where is it?
526080	527840	What have you done with the saucer?
527840	528920	Nothing.
528920	530120	Well, where is it?
530120	531960	It's not there now.
531960	534920	It was there, but then it just vanished.
534920	536120	Darnished?
536120	538120	Yes, that's right.
538120	541440	When you say vanished, you mean it flew away again?
541440	544320	No, it just went, woof, gone.
544320	546320	Moments are it, too.
546320	547400	That's very odd.
547400	548760	Yes, it was.
548760	552040	Did you see any aliens on board by any chance?
552040	553280	No.
553280	555160	Are you telling me the truth?
555160	556200	Of course.
556200	557960	Why should I lie to you?
557960	559560	Well, I can't.
559560	560760	Think of any reason.
560760	563240	I'm sorry, but it's upsetting aliens
563240	565040	invading Moment Valley.
565040	566120	Yes, it is.
566120	567400	Can we go now?
567400	569920	Certainly.
569920	572440	Where are you all going, by the way?
572440	575400	Oh, only to the beach to collect shells.
575400	578000	See you, Inspector.
578000	581640	Collecting shells, indeed, while I'm hunting for aliens.
584080	586080	Ah, over here!
586080	588280	Ah, Mom!
588280	589600	Ah, Mom!
590440	591840	Hey.
591840	594200	Oh, Aunt Lady, where are you now?
594200	596920	Where are you now?
596920	598400	Where are you now?
598400	599800	Is that an alien?
599800	602600	It certainly is, but not like it says in the book.
602600	604040	Have you tried talking to it?
604040	605840	Yes, but it wouldn't answer.
605840	607320	Let me try.
607320	610440	Are you from outer space?
610440	611560	G-so, what aÂçï.
611560	612840	Why are you acting like a dacha-dacha-dacha-dali?
612840	613400	No-din.
613400	617520	Yes, it's not going to happen to me a little bit.
617520	624600	Looks like an alien child to me more like a lamp poor thing. He must be hungry. Let's take him home
625000	627320	Yeah, well, we don't want the inspector to see him
648520	654520	I'm sorry we can't understand you, but I'm sure you'll like me up even if you don't speak English
654520	656520	Just try it and see
659520	661520	I think he's missing his home
661520	667520	Wherever in the universe that might be I wonder where his parents are he can't have come on his own
667520	669520	He seems far too little for that
669520	671520	Well, I don't know
671520	674520	But he's obviously missing them and he seems very unhappy
674520	678520	Do you think the inspector would really arrest him moving papa?
678520	681520	Possibly, he would think it is duty
681520	684520	Well, that would be horrible of him
684520	686520	I know
689520	691520	Oh, it's inspector
691520	694520	Oh dear, he mustn't find him here
696520	698520	And he's got stinky with him
698520	701520	Oh, stinky? Well, that means trouble
701520	704520	Quick, he can hide in the kitchen
704520	706520	We gotta do something!
706520	708520	And quickly
708520	710520	I know what to do
710520	713520	What mama? We'll use the machine
713520	715520	Oh yeah
725520	730520	We'll just keep him out of sight
732520	734520	Now with him, this one is right
740520	742520	Oh dear
742520	744520	I think they're here
744520	751520	Oh, moving papa, I heard there was an alien here with what?
751520	753520	What's happening?
757520	759520	What's happened to me?
760520	764520	Oh dear, yes, how very, very strange
764520	766520	You look like a great big goldworm
766520	770520	An inspector in shining armor, you mean little my?
770520	772520	That's just what I thought
772520	775520	You'll never need a lamp to be seen, inspector
775520	778520	I like it, criminals will be afraid of me
778520	782520	I can't wait to get back to the station and show the constables
782520	784520	Handy for reading in bed, too
784520	787520	Well, duty calls, bye
789520	796520	D-D-D-D-D- im-d-D-D-D-D-D D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D
797520	798520	What are you doing?
798520	801520	I didn't know that the machine was still working
801520	803520	Or you can speak English
803520	804520	Of course I can
804520	806520	It's just that I need my language converted to help me translate
806520	809520	And if you hadn't taken it from my ship and hidden it
809520	811520	I would have been able to talk sooner
811520	813520	That's a good way to learn, isn't it?
813520	815520	Where are you going?
815520	817520	To see that nice, shiny man
817520	818520	But he'll arrest you!
818520	823520	He came here looking for you, but he forgot about it when the machine started him glowing
826120	829120	No, don't go there. Hey, why?
838520	840520	What is it?
841520	842520	What?
843520	845520	Oh, you're so bright and beautiful, Inspector.
846520	847520	Oh, you think so?
848520	850520	Everyone shimmers like that, everyone.
850520	852520	Well, that must be very nice for them.
853520	854520	I want to pose you, please.
855520	858520	I'm sorry, I'm too busy, but it was nice talking to you.
859520	863520	You see, the aliens have invaded Moomin Valley and I must find them.
864520	867520	Oh, I just remembered.
867520	870520	I was tipped off that there was one of them in Moomin House.
877520	879520	The inspector's coming back.
880520	881520	What about the alien?
881520	882520	He's running after him.
882520	884520	Has he been handcuffed, Moomin?
884520	886520	I don't think so.
892520	895520	Open up in the name of the law, Moomin Papa.
895520	900520	Well, certainly for you, Inspector. Come on in. You're very welcome.
901520	906520	Moomin Papa, I have information from a reliable source, well, sort of reliable.
906520	909520	That you have been harping a fugitive.
909520	910520	I'm sorry.
910520	914520	In other words, I believe you have been hiding an alien here.
914520	919520	Oh, Inspector, I don't think hiding is the right word. That suggests we are trying to keep something from you.
919520	920520	Well, Mama.
920520	922520	Would we do that, Inspector?
926520	928520	That stinky is tricked me again.
930520	932520	Isn't it lucky he didn't find you?
932520	934520	I want a nice inspector.
934520	938520	Look, how many times must I tell you? He'll lock you up in an nasty cell.
938520	940520	I like him. I want to see him.
940520	942520	No, don't.
951520	954520	Perhaps if we press the yellow button, he'll stop shining.
954520	957520	A good idea, Papa. Be quick, Mama.
958520	959520	The yellow button.
959520	961520	You girls.
972520	976520	You don't want him now that he stopped shining. Do you, little fella?
976520	977520	No.
977520	979520	Let's go home, then.
979520	984520	Well, Mama, come and look. We've saved the alien.
984520	990520	Well, Mama, the inspector's not glowing anymore. Isn't that something?
990520	992520	Mama?
997520	999520	Mama, where are you?
999520	1001520	I'm here.
1001520	1006520	Hey, what? Where are you, Mama?
1006520	1008520	Well, Mama.
1008520	1010520	Right here.
1011520	1015520	Mama? Oh, no. What's happened to you?
1015520	1018520	I don't know. Probably that machine again.
1018520	1022520	Oh, so it shrinks you as well as making you invisible, does it? Well, well.
1022520	1025520	Oh, dear. I need an apron.
1025520	1029520	Papa, can you get a handkerchief from my handbag?
1029520	1032520	You really are quite small.
1032520	1035520	That you look very cute, of course, Mama.
1035520	1037520	Would you like to stay like that for a while?
1037520	1042520	No, I would not. Push another button quickly before anyone sees me.
1042520	1044520	Go on now. Hurry up, Papa.
1044520	1047520	Yeah. Oh, dear.
1047520	1049520	What's up?
1049520	1051520	The machine's gone.
1054520	1057520	Hey, you! Take me back!
1057520	1059520	Hey!
1059520	1060520	Papa!
1060520	1063520	Don't worry, Mama. I'll get it back.
1065520	1067520	Hey!
1067520	1069520	Hey!
1069520	1071520	Oh, thank you.
1071520	1073520	Look at that way.
1073520	1077520	Stop him, Mama. Stop him. He stole the machine.
1077520	1081520	We'll get him, Papa.
1081520	1084520	Hey, sniff!
1084520	1086520	Don't let steam keep getting away.
1086520	1089520	Right.
1089520	1092520	Leave it to me.
1095520	1098520	Please let me pass, sniff. I'll give you a gold stopper.
1098520	1100520	A gold stopper?
1100520	1102520	I mean, free. No, no. Five.
1102520	1106520	No. Give me the machine, Stinky.
1112520	1116520	Where is it, moment? What's happened to the machine?
1117520	1120520	It's at the bottom of the river, Papa.
1120520	1123520	Oh, poor Mama. Poor Mama.
1123520	1125520	What's wrong with her?
1125520	1128520	Well, she needs the machine to get back to normal.
1128520	1130520	Normal?
1135520	1140520	Well, at least this is a chance to do some really fine embroidery.
1140520	1144520	Don't worry, Mama. I promise we'll look after you.
1145520	1147520	It's all right, Moomin. I'll manage.
1147520	1150520	I'll have to get some smaller pots and pans, though,
1150520	1152520	and we'll have to have smaller helpings.
1152520	1155520	But that might not be a bad idea.
1161520	1164520	Oh.
1175520	1186520	Here, here, my parents come for me.
1186520	1189520	Mama, Papa.
1205520	1208520	It's like the one we saw in the garden.
1226520	1228520	Mama, Papa.
1228520	1231520	Oh, my God.
1232520	1234520	Oh, my God.
1234520	1236520	I'm sorry.
1236520	1238520	I'm sorry.
1238520	1241520	I'm sorry.
1250520	1254520	My parents were still thank you for looking after me.
1254520	1257520	They're telling you off, aren't they?
1257520	1260520	Yes, because I took a flying saucer.
1260520	1263520	You ask your parents to make Mama a normal size again.
1263520	1266520	Yes, of course.
1266520	1269520	Fiddle grassy, grassy girl.
1278520	1281520	Oh, well, that's more like it.
1281520	1284520	Oh, no. Oh, dear.
1284520	1286520	Oh, no. Stop. It's too much.
1286520	1288520	Oh, well, I'm sorry.
1288520	1290520	But could you try again, please?
1290520	1291520	I know.
1291520	1293520	The more of Mama there is a better one.
1293520	1294520	She's getting very large.
1294520	1295520	Very large indeed.
1295520	1297520	Oh, yeah.
1297520	1299520	Oh, oh, oh.
1314520	1317520	So, Mum and Valley hadn't really been invaded at all.
1317520	1321520	And the movements and the friends that found out where aliens really looked like.
1326520	1332520	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
1332520	1340520	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1340520	1344520	They're always happy and always at play.
1344520	1347520	The movements are having fun day after day.
1347520	1351520	The movements.
1351520	1355520	The movements.
1355520	1362520	They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.
1362520	1370520	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1370520	1373520	They're always happy and always at play.
1373520	1377520	The movements are having fun day after day.
1377520	1380520	The movements.
1380520	1384520	The movements.
1384520	1390520	The movements.
