00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
You can fly just like a bird, sing the best song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

00:46.000 --> 01:02.000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
The snow was getting thicker on the ground and it was high time for the movements to start hibernating.

01:16.000 --> 01:38.000
What are you doing now man, Alicia? What are you doing with these pine needles? That's what we always eat before we hibernate nobody knows why.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
So you're going to start hibernating? Yes tonight. Oh that's soon? Yes.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm so glad I've come to see you today instead of leaving until tomorrow then.

01:50.000 --> 01:58.000
I must say you came on just the right day, Alicia. We usually have a small party the night we start hibernating and you've arrived just in time.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Oh you mean I can stay for that woman, Mama?

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
And by the way Alicia is a matter of interest, is the witch, sorry your grandmother I mean, know that you're here?

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
No I'm afraid I didn't tell her, better for grownups not to know too much.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Oh do you say you're right?

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
I'm afraid she's not very happy for me to come here to move in valley.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Why ever not my dear?

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
I guess she's afraid that if I start coming here to play I shall lose interest in studying hard at my witchcraft.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Oh but you've got a very long time to go before you're a witch?

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
It takes anything between five to seven years nowadays.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Are you really sure that's what you want to be Alicia?

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Study something out. But I want to be a witch.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Perhaps you don't know but witches aren't terribly popular.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
Yes I do but I won't be like that, I'll be popular.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
Hey, stop here.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
You're off to the moments?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Yes.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
I thought you'd gone south already, last winter you'd gone before the snow started.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Not this year I promised Moomin.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Promise?

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
I promised not to leave Moomin Valley until he went into hibernation.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Everybody seems to be here and somebody knew.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Who's that?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Have a guess.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Very well then, it's Alicia that's my guess.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
How did you know?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
What? I'm right?

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Yes you are but I think you peaked and saw her earlier on.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
I did it. I just named somebody I thought couldn't be here.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Clever huh?

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
Well she just happened to stop by. She's with Papa who's showing her around the house.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Is the witch here too?

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
No she didn't tell the witch she was coming here.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Just as well thank goodness.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
Ah it's you snuffkin. I finally came over. I told you I would.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Hi.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Remember our friend here? He's called Sniff.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Hi, how do you do Sniff?

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Well you aren't going to use your magic to cast any spells and stuff are you?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
No.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Actually they didn't eat just pine needles for dinner that evening.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
They had lots of other nice things too. All cooked by Moomin Mama.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Snuffkin I'd like to say how story I am.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Why?

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
I persuaded you to stay on here instead of going south as you'd planned.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I'm leaving tomorrow.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
But the snow is quite deep.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Don't worry I'm used to deep snow.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
I'm just worried Alicia will find it hard to get home in this.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Well she could spell the night here but of course tomorrow will be asleep for the winter so...

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Huh?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Hmm? Someones is a door.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I'll see who it is.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
Oh hello. How are you?

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
Hello indeed my young man. My granddaughter is here isn't she?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Who is it then Moomin?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Oh my dear.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
You must be Moomin Papa.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Now you listen to me Moomin Papa.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
I don't want my granddaughter playing with your children under any circumstances.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Do I make myself quite clear?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
But Alicia likes playing with us.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Grandma!

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
We're leaving. Can't I stand a little longer?

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Hello you're most welcome to stay and have dinner with us.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
Don't you know I'm a witch? I can't eat that sort of baby food.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Alicia quite likes the food.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
The pine needles look okay. The rest is yucky. Come Alicia.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Please let me stay grandma.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Not young lady. I've told you before which is never mixed with people like this.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
And that goes for novice which is as well.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Never.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
With their knives they're really all grandma.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
And I told you that's the trouble.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
They are disgustingly sicknessly good.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
You will hear a lot more about this when we get home.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Come on now.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
It's really cold out here and there's a lot more snow on the way.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
All right I'm coming grandma.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Coming.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Oh thank you.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Mum and Papa.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yeah?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
We understand each other now don't we?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I'm sure you understand me.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Never mind about that.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
You and your whole family are never to speak to my granddaughter again.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Is that understood?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
But grandma.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Mind what I say over a vengeance of touch will come upon you.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Or even the revenge of a serious.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
If you think cheap threats like that impress Mum and Papa.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
You're making a grave mistake.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
And Papa is a highly educated gentleman.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
But I am a witch with three diplomas.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Maybe so.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
But tell me how can three diplomas help you to get home with all this snow.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Ha! Child's play to an accredited witch.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Come, Alicia.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
I've ever seen one of these before, a little pep square.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Is that really a witch's broom?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Well, never.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Let's go and see.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
I'm ready.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Hold on, Ditalisia.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Okay.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Can you both ride on that broom?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
It looks pretty scrappy to me.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Could fall to pieces any minute.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Do drive slowly in this weather.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Oh, please don't fall off, Alicia.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
But terrible chatterboxes you all are.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Please keep quiet out of you.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Are you ready, girl?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Bet they'll never be able to take off.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Huh?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Huh?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Oh...

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
What is it, Grandma?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Nothing.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Oh!

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Oh!

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Oh!

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Oh!

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Just what I thought, they're too heavy.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
Listen, I could take Alicia's place, I'm not too heavy.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Don't worry, I'm happy to walk home, Grandma.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Don't be so ridiculous, child.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
You can't walk home in all this snow.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
You'll never make it.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Only I had some skis.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Come on, climb aboard.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I'll try another spell.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Grandma, are you worried because all those people are watching you?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Shut up!

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I help you say the magic spell.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Oh!

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Oh!

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Oh!

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Oh!

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Oh!

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Oh!

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Oh!

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Oh!

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Oh!

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Oh!

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Oh!

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Oh!

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Oh!

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
They're doing it!

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
They're doing it!

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Oh!

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Oh!

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Oh!

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
What?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Oh!

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Oh!

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Oh!

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Oh!

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Oh!

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Oh!

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Oh!

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Oh!

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Oh!

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Oh!

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Where'd we go?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Oh!

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Oh!

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Oh!

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Oh!

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Oh!

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Oh!

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Oh!

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Oh!

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Oh!

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Oh!

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Oh!

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Oh!

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Oh!

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Oh!

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Oh!

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Oh!

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Oh!

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Oh!

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Oh!

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Oh!

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
She may have three diplomas, but I don't think she's very good, Mom.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
I wish they'd sing to the ground so I could fly that broom.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Guess they're all right now, Mum and Papa.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Let's go back to our dinner.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Oh!

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
I forgot to thank them for asking me to stand at dinner!

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Thank them indeed!

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
I don't think you're cut out to be a witch!

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Oh, but Grandma, I don't want to be one!

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Well, I'm quite happy to help, but the path will certainly be a difficult one.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Oh!

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Oh!

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Oh!

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Oh!

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Oh!

10:23.000 --> 10:43.000
With Alessia and the witch gone home to the Valley of the Witches, Snuffkin departed for his trip south, and the Moomins went into hibernation.

10:54.000 --> 11:03.000
They certainly would have slept till the beginning of the spring as usual, but this year.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Quite unexpectedly, something happened.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Oh!

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Oh!

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Spring here already?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
There's someone at the window!

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Oh!

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
It's frozen shut!

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Hey!

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Why did you wake me up?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Well, you shouldn't be asleep!

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Didn't you know Christmas is coming?

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
It's tomorrow, so there's not a minute to be lost!

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Christmas is coming tomorrow?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
But who on earth is that?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Why?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Who is Christmas?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
This isn't a joke moment!

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I'm not in the least ready!

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
I've lost my mittens and Christmas is coming and I haven't got a fertry yet!

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
A fertry, I really must get a fertry!

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
How very odd!

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Why a fertry?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Hey!

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Why?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Oh, what's that, Moomins?

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
Well, Christmas is almost coming and we don't have a fertry yet!

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Christmas?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Hmm.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Did you say Christmas is coming?

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Yes, and before that, one must have a fertry!

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
What's this about a fertry?

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
Well, you need one to protect ourselves against this Christmas person, Moomins Mama.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I am not really quite clear on that point.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
But there's something awful that has to be kept away, right?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
I better go get a fertry!

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Ha!

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
About time you Moomins got up?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
How are you going to see?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Pretty good fertry, Dad!

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Well, thank you, Gavsie, but could you tell me something?

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
What is one supposed to do with it?

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Oh, really, Moomins Papa!

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
The way you can joke with such a straight face!

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Joke?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Eh?

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Love to stay, but I haven't even finished cooking yet!

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I wasn't joking.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
No one believed me either!

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Would you like a little more, young man?

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
No, thank you very much. I'm really nice and warm again now.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
I saw Moomins Papa and Moomins bring up a big tree!

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
But what is one supposed to do with it?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Don't you know?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
No!

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Why are you decorated as beautifully as you can?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Really?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Christmas is coming, so I better be off!

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Everyone's talking of Christmas!

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
By now, I've got a long way to go!

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Take care, dear!

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Hello!

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Hello!

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Bye-bye!

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Bye-bye!

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Good-bye!

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Who was that?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
I don't know!

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
He was in a hurry to get somewhere before Christmas!

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
So I gave him some tea!

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
That was nice!

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
And he told us what to do with the fir tree!

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
What did he say?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
To decorate it beautifully!

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Decorate it, but why should we do that, Mama?

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
I guess we must decorate the tree to make sure we keep Christmas happy!

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Yes, you're right!

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
We'd better start doing it right away!

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Yes, I'm sure there's another moment to lose!

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
No!

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Mama!

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Yes, dear!

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
They also say we have to cook lots of food for Christmas!

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Goodness!

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Well, at least he won't be eating us then!

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Here!

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Thank you, Snorkmaid!

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Oh!

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
The ship means rather a lot to me!

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
It will look fantastic on the tree, Papa!

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Yes, dear, I suppose you're right!

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Oh!

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Why don't we put this at the top?

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
This is Mama's!

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Don't worry!

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Mmm, that looks beautiful!

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Listen, everybody!

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas, too!

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Really, Mama?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Yes, I do!

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas, too!

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Really, Mama?

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
I don't wonder what this Christmas will be like!

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
What if it's an awful greedy, beastly monster like the grove?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Don't worry, Snorkmaid!

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
We'll give him lots of presents and stuff him full of food!

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Have you thought of any presents for Christmas yet?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I don't know what to give him!

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Look, a seashell!

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Oh, that's a beauty!

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Oh, look, Mama, what I got for Christmas!

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
I'm going to give him a pretty lure for fishing!

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
I'm giving him this book!

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Great presents!

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
I'm sure he'll be very happy with the moment family and not Thomas at all!

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I think Christmas will come any moment now!

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
So do I!

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Oh, dear!

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
I do hope he likes my pumpkin pie!

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
He will!

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Imagine everyone in Moomin Valley being frightened!

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Mmm!

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Mmm!

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Are you sleepy?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Yes, I am!

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
I can't stay this scared for much longer!

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Better come before all the food freezes!

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Oh!

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
He's coming!

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
I never thought Christmas could be that small!

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Merry Christmas!

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Merry Christmas! Is that what he is?

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Well, it's just what you say!

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
All of my life I have dreamed of seeing all this up close, honestly!

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
I never really thought a Christmas tree could be this beautiful!

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Brought my friends, too!

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
You're all very welcome!

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Oh, thank you!

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Hear that, everybody?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
We're all very welcome!

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Woo!

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Man, let's get him!

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
There's some wonderful things here!

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Yeah!

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Oh, what a lot of food you've made!

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Yes, all the food there is for Christmas!

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
And are those real presents?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Yeah!

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
All of my life, I've sort of wondered about those things called presents!

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
Papa, I don't think these creatures are Christmas!

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Neither do I!

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
You look sleepy!

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I am!

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Must be well past midnight!

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
What is Christmas doing, Mama?

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Aren't you sleepy, too, little ones?

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Sleepy with a wonderful Christmas tree like this to look at!

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Hey, Papa!

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
What is it?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Hmm, maybe.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Nobody can get really angry this late at night, surely!

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
We'll close the doors and perhaps we'll be safe inside!

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I'm sure you're right!

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
Listen, my friends, we'd like to give you the tree and the food and the presents!

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
What?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
All of this?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
For us?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Yes, we want to sleep!

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
We're far more sleepy than scared!

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Snort, Ma'am?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Oh, I see here yet!

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
No, but we decided to go back to hibernating!

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Bye-bye!

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
I thought Christmas tree should have a star on top!

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
I don't think it makes any difference, you know?

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
A nice rose is just as good as a star!

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Look at that!

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
And apparently it didn't make any difference at all!

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Because the moon and family slept as peacefully as ever!

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
All through the night, without Christmas!

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Coming!

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Anywhere!

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Hi!

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
And apparently it didn't make any difference at all!

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Because the moon and family slept as peacefully as ever!

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
All through the night, without Christmas!

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Coming anywhere near them!

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
So probably, he went someplace else!

21:32.000 --> 21:38.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements!

21:38.000 --> 21:46.000
You're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements!

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
They're always happy and always at play!

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
The movements are having fun day after day!

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
The movements!

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
The movements!

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
The movements!
