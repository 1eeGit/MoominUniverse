    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They're here for you on your TV.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They are the movements.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They are the movements.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So come on.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Come on.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come you are your TV. They are the movements. They are the movements.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:38.399
So come with me, give me your hand. I'll take you up to a moment land. You can fly just like a bird.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:50.000
Sing that song ever. There were the movements. There were the movements. There were the movements, there was the movements

I asked her if she wanted to play with us, and she said yes!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Danny, come on!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We're going to have some fun! She wanted to play with us, and she said yes!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Minnie, come on! We're going to have some fun!

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Right, let's go.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Ninny, who became invisible because of her sarcastic ant, was now visible up to the neck.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
But no matter how much of Granny's remedy she took

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
or how nice the movements were to her,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:53.000
her head still remained invisible. So...

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
That's the invisible child. I wonder what she really looks like.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Ugh, well good morning everybody.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.400
Morning, lazy bones. We've been up for hours and hours.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.719
We're going to play hide and seek in the woods.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.120
Great.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.680
Nini, are you all right?

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.319
Yes, thanks.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.439
Hmm.

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:14.280
This is dumb.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.039
If I could see your face, I wouldn't have to ask.

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:18.280
Doesn't help with you, Sniff.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:43.000
You always ask silly questions. It's a bit big for hide and seek isn't it?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
But that's so good about it!

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Okay, this is a good place to start, but we've got a new rule for the game.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Once you find somewhere to hide, you've got to stay in the same place, no moving about anyone.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Do you understand, Ninny?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Right, you're to go first, Sniff.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Huh? Why isn't always me first?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
We'll have a practice for nanny's sake.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Show her what to do.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Uh, I didn't see it because an easy game.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Not for nanny, it isn't. She's never played it before.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
What? Never ever?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
No, and not just hide and seek.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
She hasn't played any games at all.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Not even when she was visible?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
No, nothing.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.040
Oh, that's terrible. So, will you was visible? No nothing. Oh that's terrible. So will you go first?

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:34.879
No I won't. Oh okay I'll go first then. I'll count to 10 slowly so you'll have plenty of time to find somewhere.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:47.000
One, two, Mini. Hurry up. For!

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Five!

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I can still see you.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Six!

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Seven!

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Good, good, good! Hello, Minnie.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Don't be frightened.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Why don't you hide in that bush over there?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
He'll never find you.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I'm coming.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Thank you. Oh, my God! God, you sniff! Eh.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Huh?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Huh?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Huh?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Huh?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Huh?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Huh?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Huh?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Huh?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Huh?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Huh?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Huh?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Huh?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Huh?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Huh?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Huh?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Huh?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Huh?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Oh, I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I'm so excited.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I'm so excited.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I'm so excited.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I'm so excited.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I'm so excited.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I'm so excited.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I'm so excited.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I'm so excited.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I'm so excited.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I'm so excited. I'm so excited. Oops!

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Got you, little Mike.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I'd like to know where Ninny's hiding.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Oh, look. Oh!

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Ah, come out, Ninny.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I've got you.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
That was a good place, but I saw your ribbeth.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Oh! Now for snork maiden. She's always easy to find.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Ha! That's only because she wants to be found.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Found you snork maiden. One.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Two.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Don't wait, nanny, this is my bush.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Four.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Hey, nanny, I'll show you a good place. Just come with your uncle stinky.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Now don't worry, no one will find you there.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
It opens up once you're inside.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:06.319
Come on, it's a bit steep, I'll help you.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.000
Oh!

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Oh!

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Oh!

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Oh!

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Oh!

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Oh!

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Oh!

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Oh!

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Oh!

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Oh!

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Oh!

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Oh!

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Oh!

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Oh!

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Oh!

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Oh!

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Oh!

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Oh!

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Right, that should keep you quiet. You're a bit too visible at the moment.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Oh, let me out.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But I'm sure if you stay here until tomorrow,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
no one will see it all.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Please don't leave me here.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Please.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Oh, it's...

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Oh, please.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
That's it.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Now tomorrow we'll hit the bank!

00:08:47.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Let me out! Please let me out!

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I'm very glad I thought of bringing Ninny here.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It's nice to have her here too, Tiki.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
She's no trouble at all.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
You're all pretty eccentric,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and it might be just what she needs to make her want to be seen again.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Oh, and you're very kind, of course.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Well, thank you. I think, I suppose we should be flattens, shouldn't we?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Oh, yes, definitely.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.159
She started to talk, but her voice is very weak.

00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:28.960
You have to listen very carefully.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.639
Has it always been like that?

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:32.240
Or just since she was invisible?

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.000
I'm not sure.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.440
I don't think it was like that before.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.000
Lots of people manage very well without using their heads,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.480
so I'm certain any will be all right.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.679
Yes, and I'm glad she's got movement in the others to play with.

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:46.000
She's never had anybody before, you know.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.299
I think she'd find it a bit difficult to tickle.

00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:53.000
Well, Moomin, Mama, I think that all she needs is something to shock her out of it.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Huh. Got you little, my.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Oh, that bush was too prickly anyway.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I expect I'm the last one, hey.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
No, I haven't found any yet.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Mini?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.600
I didn't think Mini would hide so well.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.100
Any luck, Sniff?

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.379
There's nowhere else to look, Momen.

00:10:10.379 --> 00:10:13.500
Perhaps she's lost or fallen or hurt herself.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.139
I've looked absolutely everywhere.

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:18.139
I bet she's invisible again.

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:20.480
That's why I can't find her.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.080
I bet Sniff hasn't looked everywhere.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.519
She can't be far.

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:26.000
Do you know where she is, Moomin?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
No, I haven't seen her at all. Not since we started.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Nanny! Come on, we're going home. We've finished playing.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Nanny!

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Oh my goodness, where could she be?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Nanny!

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
It's your turn, Sniff, so you've got to find her.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Nanny!

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Not once the game's over, I haven't.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.399
Never mind. We'll all look. We must find her.

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:51.399
We are supposed to be looking after her, you know?

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:53.399
Ugh.

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:57.799
Aw, come on. Nanny, the game's over. We've finished.

00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:02.600
Nanny, Nanny, hurry up. We're going home for cookies and lemonade.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.600
Nanny, Nanny! Nanny!

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.600
Nanny!

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.600
Nanny!

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.600
Nanny!

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.600
Nanny!

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.600
Nanny!

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600
Nanny!

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.600
Nanny!

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.600
Nanny!

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.600
Nanny!

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.600
Nanny!

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.600
Nanny!

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600
Nanny!

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.600
Nanny!

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.600
Nanny!

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.600
Nanny!

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.600
Nanny!

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.600
Nanny!

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.600
Nanny!

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.600
Can you hear us?

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.000
We weren't supposed to come this far, Snork Maiden. Nanny! Nanny! Can you hear us?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
We weren't supposed to come this far, Snork Maiden.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
She might be really lost or frightened or anything!

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Nanny! Where are you, Nanny?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Can you hear me? Nanny!

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Help! I'm over here!

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Did you hear something?

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:46.279
I'm not sure. Help!

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:47.279
Help!

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:48.279
I'm here!

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:50.720
That's her!

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.919
She's not far away!

00:11:52.919 --> 00:11:53.919
Lenny!

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:55.320
Where are you?

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.320
Here!

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.320
Behind this rock!

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.360
Of course her voice coming from!

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.200
That way I think!

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200
Lenny!

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.460
I can't hear what you're saying.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.460
Try and shout a bit louder.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.360
I'm over here!

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.639
Over here!

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:12.200
Behind the rock!

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.200
I still can't hear properly.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.200
Louder than any louder!

00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:18.740
Behind the rock!

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.240
Which rock?

00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:21.899
Over here!

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:23.399
The big rock!

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Over there!

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I've never shouted so much in my life!

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Nanny!

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Nanny, are you behind this rock, Nanny?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Yes! Stinky block the cave with it!

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Don't worry, we'll get you out.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:49.600
Hang on!

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.200
Are you alright, Lily? Thank you, Mum.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.500
Oh, thank you!

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.299
Your voice seems to be...

00:12:57.799 --> 00:12:59.899
Oh, what? Oh, nothing.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.299
Try and hold on to me, and I'll pull you out.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.500
Oh, thank you!

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Hey, what's happened?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Where'd you find her?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
In the cave.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Wow, what a brilliant hiding place had you find it!

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
What's wrong? Did I say something funny?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Now that was very mean of stinking. The clever idea though, I meant to use it for a ban robbery.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Oh, Papa!

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Oh I know stinky shouldn't have done it,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and it must have been a nasty shopping trapped in the dark in that cave,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
but no real harm came to her and she didn't disappear,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and her voice got much stronger.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.639
Because she yelled so loud.

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:49.200
Oh, goodness, did you, dear?

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.080
Yes, Mum and Mama.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.840
Mum and told me to yell loudly so he'd know where I was.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.679
And it was loud too.

00:13:56.679 --> 00:13:58.320
Good for you, Nanny.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.919
It's surprising the things you can do if you have to, and you ought to remember that

00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:05.000
people who speak loudly are usually very noticeable.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Go on, yeah, I want to see it.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
That's a good idea, Ninny.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
If shouting brought back your voice, you never know it might be just what's needed to make the rest of you visible.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Try and get angry as well.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Yeah, that's easy. Just think about stinky.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Yeah, and how horrible he is.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
That should make you angry. Very angry.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Just your white stinky!

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
I can't help faster than me!

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Stinky, wait! We want to talk to you!

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I don't want to talk to you!

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
No!

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Come on!

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Oh, you are right, sniff!

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
You can't get away, stinky.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
The forest is my home ground. You won't catch me in here.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Ah!

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I did it.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:25.440
Hold it. This hole to change your mind and scare her so much that she'd become totally invisible again

00:15:25.679 --> 00:15:31.559
She had to be invisible for my plan now get me out of here. It's all right. Stinking. See you tomorrow

00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:46.000
You crux you things I had such a wonderful plan! Ah! Ah! They're spiteful!

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Oh, let's hear them my next job!

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
But despite all that had happened,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Ninny's face was still not to be seen.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Then, about ten days later... This weather seems to push the nails out.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:18.000
I haven't seen anyone stare at the sea like Minnie does.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Well maybe she's crying now.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:36.000
What's the matter?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:47.000
It's the sea. It's far too big! You don't have to go on it, you know.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Mama! Mama! What's up?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Hmm?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
What's the matter with her?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Nothing to worry about. She's never seen the sea before

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and she's just surprised at how big it is.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.759
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What's the matter with her? Nothing to worry about. She's never seen the sea before, and she's just surprised at how big it is.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.400
Well, there's an awful lot of water, that's for sure.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.400
Oh.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.599
Nanny's lucky.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:24.400
I wish there was something to surprise or excite me.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.559
Nothing's happened for weeks. Anything would be nice.

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:29.279
Mama must be bored.

00:17:29.279 --> 00:17:30.799
I think you're right.

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:32.480
But she never gets bored.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.240
Well, she is now. She needs something to happen.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.319
I think we should do something to surprise her.

00:17:38.319 --> 00:17:39.640
Like what?

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.000
Well, I know what we can do.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.119
Well, tell me.

00:17:43.119 --> 00:17:47.000
We'll creep up behind her and just give her a little push.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
What, Papa?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Push her into the sea?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Oh, Papa, you can't.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Mama wouldn't like it.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Just watch me.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
But the water's freezing.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
A mama will get all wet.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
We never found the water too cold when we were your age.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
You young people today have no sense of fun.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Did you really used to do things like that?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.980
All the time. Papa?

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:06.980
Yes, Mumann?

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:07.980
Oh, nothing.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.480
Don't worry, Mumann.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.160
Mumann, Joy's a prank.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:40.000
You'll find it very funny, I promise. I know you don't!

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
No! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Don't you dare push your end to that big horrible scene.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Let me explain to me.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
There's nothing to explain.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
You're a big bully.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
She'd have gone all wet.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
What a nasty trick.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
You could never, never. I'm sorry. Yeah. What? What? What?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
What?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
What?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
What?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
What?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
What?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
What?

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
What?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
What?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
What?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
What?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
What?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
What?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
What?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
What?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
What?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
What?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
What?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
What?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
What?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
What? What? What? What? What? I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
I'm sorry!

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
What on earth happened? Were you up to something?

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Oh, nothing much.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
You know, that child has got the sharpest teeth

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
with the without our head.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
A woman?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
A woman at last? I'm visible again.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:48.039
We're always you won't disappear again. Never, I'll never. Brave girl, and with a good strong set of healthy teeth too.

00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:50.720
Oh, I'm so happy, nanny.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.640
Mimi dear.

00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:55.799
I'm very glad too.

00:20:00.839 --> 00:20:01.359
Oh.

00:20:04.359 --> 00:20:25.000
Oh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Stop laughing you horrible child you use Sartuth monster.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:47.000
What's so funny? Really? Ninny laughed? Well, she certainly changed, Moomin, Mama.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
All she needed was to get angry, and she did.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
I hope Moomin poppies forgiven Ninny.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Thank you all for taking such good care of her.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
I hate to say it, but she sounds almost as bad as it'll mine out.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. all for taking such good care of her.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
I hate to say it, but she sounds almost as bad as it'll mine out.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Tiki! Nini!

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
And so Nini left movement house with Tiki.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.920
Now that she was completely visible and far from Timid,

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.920
she was ready for anything.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.400
Anything that is except seeing her aunt, she said.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.400
Hey.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.400
Hmm.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.400
Hmm.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.400
Hmm.
