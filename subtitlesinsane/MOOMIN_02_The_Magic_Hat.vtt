Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They hear for you on your TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:30.000
They are the movements, there are the movements,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.159
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land, you can fly

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.040
He likes being on his own and is decided to stay there until winter comes.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.879
Happy and a peace with the world.

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:04.159
Mumin loves to spend as much time as he can, his friend Snuffkin.

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.159
Snuffkin? Snuffkin?

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:07.799
Snuffkin?

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.400
Where are you?

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.000
He must have forgotten I was coming and got off somewhere.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.400
How can he enjoy being here on his own?

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.599
I'd like to be alone now and then you know.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.400
Oh, silly. Let's go and explore.

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.800
Let's leave it till tomorrow, Snork Maiden.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.060
But we said we'd go today.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.740
Yeah, we did too, Moomin.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.740
You are the one that said it, you know.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.039
Hmm, you did. I didn't.

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:33.300
You did too.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.699
Oh, you must come.

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.340
We're going to collect shells on the beach.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.900
Come on, it'll be fun.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.139
Oh, no.

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.139
What?

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.639
Do what?

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:44.939
Hey!

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.000
It's sniff. Where are you guys going?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Oh, I envy Snuffkin.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Oh, why?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Why just do?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I wonder where Snuffkin has gone.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I wonder if we'll ever find anything as exciting as the hat.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Yeah, it was exciting as the hat.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Yeah, it was very special that hat.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Did you really throw it in the river?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Yeah.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I wish you hadn't.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It was much too dangerous to keep.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Look at the horrible things it did to me.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But what about the eggshells it turned into clowns?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Yeah, it was good fun flying around.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Perhaps I'll find an oyster with a huge pearl inside. Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Oh!

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Oh!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Mom!

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Mom!

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Mom!

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Mom!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Wake up!

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Snorkmaid needs help!

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
What?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
What's happened?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We were playing tag and she fell into an outline hole.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
We've got to get her out quickly.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.800
Come on, Mom! Nearly there, Snort-baiting just a bit further.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.800
Help me, Sniff!

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800
Give me your hand!

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.800
Hurry!

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.800
Look out!

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.800
It's the head, Lion!

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.800
Look what you're doing to my whole...

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.800
I'm sorry.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.800
I'll be out soon.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.800
Stop yelling and kicking like that.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:30.000
You're scaring off my prey!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Are you alright, Snark Maiden? I can't reach her!

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I don't have to have ants for lunch, you know!

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Don't be moving, please!

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
You better get in there, Sniff!

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
What? Me?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.339
Don't worry. I'll hold on to you. You're the only one tall enough, Sniff what me don't worry I'll hold on to you. You're the only one tall enough sniff come on

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:49.879
I sent tasty I'll eat you and step

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:25.279
Get in there. You're big I'm gonna die for you! I'm gonna die for you! Stay keeping!

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:45.000
Come on, nearly! A bit! Where have you been, Stuffkin? That's a big secret, movement.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I won't tell anyone.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
All right. It's the magic hat.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
It's on a sandbank further down the river.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Gosh!

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
But something terrible is happening.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
What? What is it?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Oh, dear.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I'm going to get a little bit of a ride.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I'm going to get a little bit of a ride. Oh gosh! But something terrible is happening. What? What is it?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Oh dear, perhaps we shouldn't have thrown it in the river.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It's too late now.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Let's get there cooking. There it is. It's caught on a branch in the middle.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Where? Oh, Smoughkin, I can see it. Look at the water, it's all red.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Hmm, seems to be coming from the hat. I wonder what it is, Moody.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I'll go and get it. Be careful.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.839
Shall I come too?

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:47.759
No, you stay there.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.339
Have you got it?

00:06:55.339 --> 00:07:23.480
Uh-huh. Wow! It's raspberry juice! What should we do with the hat?

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.000
Well, I don't think it's a good idea to leave it lying around.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Somebody might crawl into it.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
But if we put water in it, we can have as much rasp-reduced as we can drink.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Well, that would be nice. But you know, Moomin,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
it could only be river water that does that. You know what I mean, Moomin?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Well, I think it's worth experimenting.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
What's the matter, Moonin? You look very tired. I woke up in the night and couldn't get back to sleep.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Ha! Pardon? Couldn't get back to sleep. Ha! Pardon?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Couldn't get back to sleep.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Ha! What are you talking about?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I was awake last night too.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And I know why you're so tired.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
You must have been dreaming.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Thanks, mama.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Where are you going, Moomin?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Moomin!

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Somewhere you can't come.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Somewhere private.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So what was that all about, huh?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Oh, nothing really important, Moomin, Papa.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I think I'll go out. Ha ha, nobody hides anything from little, my.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Snoffkin!

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Hey, I found out who's had it is.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Who's?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
The hobgoblins.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The hobgoblins?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Yeah, I asked the who's had it is.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Who's?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
The Hobgoblins.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
The Hobgoblins?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Yeah, I asked the Hemmielin and he told me that he saw him once long ago wearing that.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I heard about the wizard who flies in the sky.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Yeah, on the back of a black panther.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
The Hobgoblins is hundreds of years old and cares only for rubies.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.159
He rides all over the world, searching for them. He's truly awesome.

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:34.799
And so when he dropped his hat? He must have been looking for some rubies right here in

00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:41.279
Mumen Valley. Do you think he's got a lot of hats, Snuffkin? Gee, I don't know. Well, do you think

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:46.000
perhaps he doesn't know where he dropped his hat? Yeah, I suppose that's possible.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Snuffkin, there's something I would like to try with the hat.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Just don't put it on. Will you?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
He's in there somewhere. At glions are pretty stupid, you know.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Yes, Moomin Papa told me it takes him hours to dig themselves into the sand.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Oh no, it doesn't. It only takes the one hour.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Only an hour? You're kidding.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Well, of course, an hour is a long time to spend digging.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Are you talking about me?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Yes. About how quickly you could dig yourself into a hole in the sand.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.539
A lot quicker than you think it'll take.

00:10:25.539 --> 00:10:28.000
Mumin here says it takes you only one hour

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.120
to dig a hole in the sand, but I can't believe that.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.360
Huh.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.360
Snuffkill says it takes several hours,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.960
but I think he's wrong.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.360
I'll show you how long.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.600
Gosh, that was rather fast.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.720
Yeah, but it's obvious he's already

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.919
got a ready-made hole hidden there.

00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:47.919
Don't you ant lion.

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:51.919
No, I do not.

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:55.320
I can dig myself in anywhere, anywhere at all.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.320
Where?

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:03.320
How about here?

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.440
Yeah, OK.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.000
Under this rock. All right?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Anywhere. Just show me.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Okay. Start from here.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Yeah. Just there if you don't mind.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
All right. Start counting.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Yeah.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Wow. You only took a second and a half.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
He's really something, isn't he?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.440
He certainly is. I'd better sit on it a half. He's really something, isn't he? He certainly is.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.919
I'd better sit on it.

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:29.440
Yeah, he'll be really mad.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:47.000
So you've caught the outline. I've been watching.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Little boy.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Right.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Did you follow us last night?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Yes.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Oh, did you tell the others?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Oh, don't be silly you guys. I haven't said a word yet.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
But you will if we don't let you join in with us.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
That's what she's doing, movement.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.899
No. As if I do such a thing. Of course. I'm forgetting how nice and kind you are.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.700
Hey, what is that?

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:28.399
Nope. No hat anywhere.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.200
There's gallons of water. Gosh, there sure must be a lot of sand in there.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
He must have changed into something else by now.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Probably.

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:40.799
There must have been a long enough, oh, jump off.

00:12:43.799 --> 00:12:48.879
He isn't strong enough to move the rock by himself. Shall we help him?

00:12:48.879 --> 00:13:06.000
No don't! Come on let's do it. What's happened to him? Let's turn it over. Oh no I can't look.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.500
Uhhh!

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Oh!

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
It's a hedgehog! It's a headchump. It's a headchump. It's a headchump.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
It's a headchump.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
It's a headchump.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
It's a headchump.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
It's a headchump.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
It's a headchump.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
It's a headchump.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
It's a headchump.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
It's a headchump.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
It's a headchump.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
It's a headchump. It's a headchump. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Oh, my God!

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Oh, my God!

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Oh, my God!

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Muleman!

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I was stopping. Don't push me, Lily. Why?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:25.000
A moment. I'm afraid so. I hope you hit it well. The seller.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Will it be safe there?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Well, only the seller can't get away.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
I'm afraid so.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I'm afraid so. I hope you hit it well.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
The seller.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Will it be safe there?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Well, only the seller can't get away.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.500
I'm afraid so. I hope you hit it well. The seller.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.100
Will it be safe there?

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.200
Well, only little my and us two know where it is.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.899
Hmm.

00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:06.000
The red?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000
I wonder if it's possible to change it into spaghetti.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Huh?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Hmm. Not exactly spaghetti. Mama! Mama!

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
There's something I think you oughta know.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
What is it, dear?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
There are strange things happening in the house.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
In the house?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.860
There's a tree in the cellar.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.840
A tree?

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.840
That's nice.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.340
What did you say, a real tree?

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.840
Yes, and it seems to be growing and growing.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.039
What have you done, little lie?

00:15:59.039 --> 00:16:01.879
Just dropped a bit of thread into the magic hat.

00:16:01.879 --> 00:16:03.919
But movement threw it away.

00:16:03.919 --> 00:16:04.879
Yeah, we did.

00:16:04.879 --> 00:16:06.279
But we sort of found it again

00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:08.120
and put it in the cellar.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.679
Oh, dear.

00:16:09.679 --> 00:16:12.720
We must tell Moomin Papa before it's too late.

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:17.360
Come in.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.279
It's not locked.

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:24.600
Keep going, tree.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.000
You can grow as big as you like. And just tell me if you're thirsty or anything!
