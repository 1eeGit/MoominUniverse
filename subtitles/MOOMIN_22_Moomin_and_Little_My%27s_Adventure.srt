00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,120
here they are for one and all the moments are about to come on and sit down here with me

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:28,080
they're here for you on your TV they are the moments they are the moments

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:38,640
so come with me give me your hand i'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just like a bird

4
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,520
sing that song ever there were the moments there were the moments

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:57,920
there were the moments there were the moments

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,160

bye bye bye bye

8
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:26,360
About what is this it looks like movement as restless as if something has disturbed him I wonder what he was dreaming about

9
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:41,880
I wonder what time it is oh it nearly 20 after 2

10
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,880
I wonder whether it's morning or afternoon.

11
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,880
It doesn't really matter, I suppose.

12
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
Oh, it stopped.

13
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Oh, it's frozen.

14
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,880
It looks really dark out there.

15
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,880
Mama, Mama, please wake up.

16
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Papa, Papa.

17
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,880
Mama, Mama.

18
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Mama, what's wrong with me? I feel way too weak.

19
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,880
It's very odd. I don't usually wake up when I'm hibernating.

20
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,880
Oh, dear. The whole house is buried in snow.

21
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,880
Oh, no.

22
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Oh, no.

23
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,880
Oh, Papa!

24
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

25
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,880
This doesn't look like Moomin Valley.

26
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,880
And it's so quiet.

27
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,880
What was that?

28
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Perhaps I better go home.

29
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,880
No, what's the matter with me?

30
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,880
Everyone's asleep, and the furniture's all covered up,

31
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,880
and Moomin's don't give up.

32
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Oh, I wish Northkin were here.

33
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,880
He's probably in the far south where it's warm and sunny.

34
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,880
I wonder what that is.

35
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Oh.

36
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,880
That sounds like...

37
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Oh, yes, it's little Mai.

38
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
By the bobble, what are you doing here, Moomin?

39
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
What am I doing here?

40
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,880
I heard strange noises and came to see what it was.

41
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Then you crashed into me like an avalanche,

42
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,880
and I've just lifted the box off you.

43
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,880
Oh, don't be stupid, Moomin.

44
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,880
I mean, why are you out in the snow and not hibernating like the others?

45
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Spring's not for ages.

46
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,880
Oh, I don't know. I just woke up and couldn't get back to sleep.

47
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,880
But what about you, sliding about like that, you should be asleep too.

48
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
Yes, I should, but I just woke up as well.

49
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Probably to look after you.

50
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,880
I tried to wake my stupid sister, but she kept on snoring.

51
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
But I think this snow is really great.

52
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Well, I don't. It's cold, it's slippy, much too bright,

53
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,880
and it's everywhere and far too quiet.

54
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,880
I saw the grok.

55
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,880
Wow, that horrible freezing monster.

56
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,880
She should feel at home in this, and there's no point in her trying to freeze anything.

57
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,880
I saw her on the hill.

58
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Then it was her voice, I heard.

59
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Yes, and the trouble with the horror thing is that she's so cold,

60
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,880
I wouldn't even want to touch her, Moomin.

61
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,880
It's her!

62
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Oh!

63
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
I'm getting cold shivers all over.

64
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Wow, why do you expect in the snow?

65
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
No, it's the grok's fault. She's done it.

66
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Look at my skin, it's all goose bumpy.

67
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,880
It's not like that in the summer, it's smooth, not lumpy.

68
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,880
It's not the snow that makes me feel so cold, it's her staring at me.

69
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
I'm scared.

70
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,880
That was great.

71
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,880
Good, isn't it?

72
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
You can have as much as you like.

73
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,880
We picked more raspberries than ever this year,

74
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,880
and Mama made lots of juice.

75
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,880
Thanks.

76
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,880
Oh.

77
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Ah!

78
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
I want that.

79
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
Mama's silver tray?

80
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Yeah.

81
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
What do you want it for?

82
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
To slide on the snow with a coarse stupid.

83
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,880
But it's a sort of family treasure and heirloom.

84
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Well, you never use it and it's so shiny.

85
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,880
It'll make a great sled and go really fast.

86
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Doesn't look like they'll wake up till spring.

87
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
They're lucky, they're still sleeping.

88
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,880
I think it's very unfair that I woke up like this.

89
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
So, what should we do now?

90
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,880
I want to go look at the sea.

91
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
Good idea.

92
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
At least that won't be covered in snow.

93
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
I bet the great cold was just like this.

94
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Oh no!

95
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
What's the matter?

96
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
I forgot the tray.

97
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Never mind.

98
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,880
You couldn't use it as a boat anyway and it would sink.

99
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
Yes, you could.

100
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
What?

101
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
How?

102
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Oh look!

103
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
There's the sink!

104
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
But it's all frozen.

105
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,880
So we'll be able to slide on it.

106
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
What's that over there?

107
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Huh?

108
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
Huh?

109
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
Doe ticky!

110
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
Hello, you too.

111
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
You're not hibernating, either?

112
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,680
Oh, no. I haven't got time to spend four months sleeping.

113
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,280
Why not? Little Mayan, I just woke up and now we don't know what to do.

114
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,080
I'm sure you can think of something.

115
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,480
You suppose so?

116
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,280
I've never seen the sea frozen before.

117
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Did you make that horse too, Tiki?

118
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Yes, I did.

119
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Can I sit on it?

120
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,680
No, you can't. I need it for the lady of the cold.

121
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,280
Oh, I see.

122
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
I suppose you've heard of her.

123
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,480
Yes, she's very beautiful, but if she looks into your eyes, you're turned into a block of ice.

124
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,280
She's not a very nice lady.

125
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,480
That's right, Little Mayan.

126
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
Spring can never come while she's here.

127
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,080
It waits for her to go.

128
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Oh, I see.

129
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,480
And are you hoping she'll ride away on this horse, then?

130
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,680
Yes, and it will take her back to the north, where she stays until she comes here again next winter and drives the sun away.

131
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,280
The horse doesn't look very solid to me, Tiki.

132
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Well, that's why I'm going to pour water over it when it gets really cold and then it'll be solid.

133
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,480
When is the lady of the cold coming?

134
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,480
You can never tell, but soon, tonight, perhaps, it feels much colder already.

135
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,680
What's happened to the sun, Tiki?

136
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,080
Do you know when the sun will come back again?

137
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:09,880
It's in the south, shining on snuffkin, but it'll be back soon, and then it will stay a bit longer each day.

138
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,080
Good, I can't wait.

139
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,280
Now, there'll be a full moon tonight, and we'll be able to see everything.

140
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,880
Great, I can get my tray up.

141
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
I can't wait to try it on the sea.

142
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,680
What do you mean, your tray?

143
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,080
Well, let's move in, Mama's tray, but I'm using it.

144
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,080
I'm going to put a sail on it and slide across the ice.

145
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,480
Why not wait till tomorrow?

146
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,680
Wait until tomorrow?

147
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,480
No.

148
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,680
When I want to do something, I do it now.

149
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,680
What if the ice suddenly melts or something?

150
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
I like it here.

151
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,080
It's warm and cozy.

152
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,280
I hope Mom and Papa doesn't mind me using it.

153
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,280
This is Papa's bathhouse.

154
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,280
He built it himself, and he'd be very glad to know you're using it.

155
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,880
It's great.

156
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
The window paints a different colors.

157
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,680
If you look out through one, the world is red, and through another one, the world is green.

158
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:13,280
Oh, you don't hibernate either, do you?

159
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Now scram, the horrible lady of the cold is coming and if she looks you in the eye, you'll

160
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
turn to ice.

161
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Go on, go away.

162
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Moomin, two-tiggy, Moomin, Moomin, do-tiggy, where are you?

163
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,680
Little Mike, we're over here, huh?

164
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,680
What are you doing down there?

165
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,680
Do-tiggy's trying to catch some fish.

166
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,680
If she does, she's going to cook us some dinner.

167
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Right.

168
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,480
I've got to get sailing, man.

169
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,480
I'd better go see what she's doing to Mama Silver Trey.

170
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Okay.

171
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Ah, got one.

172
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Oh dear, me.

173
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
It's cold and wet under that ice.

174
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,480
How are you doing, Little Mike?

175
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,480
Very well, thank you.

176
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
How can you get under the ice anyway?

177
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,480
I guess the water must be low and there's a gap left there.

178
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
Oh, how?

179
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,480
I don't know, but perhaps the tide was in when the sea froze and some of it got stuck to the shore.

180
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,480
Oh, I suppose it's possible.

181
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Do-tiggy told me that she has fish soup every day in the wintertime.

182
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
I know.

183
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
I'll go see if the horse is frozen yet.

184
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,480
Make sure you shut the door behind you.

185
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Oh, my thumb!

186
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
I don't think it's hard enough yet.

187
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,480
It'll collapse if the lady of the cold gets on it now.

188
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,480
Oh, it's getting colder and colder.

189
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,480
Oh, it's getting colder and colder.

190
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,480
Oh, it's getting colder and colder.

191
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
The grog.

192
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
Don't tell me you want to ride the horse.

193
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,480
I don't think you'd better.

194
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
This is for the lady of the cold, you know.

195
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,480
There's no telling what she'd do to you.

196
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Look you in the eye, probably.

197
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,480
Even the grog is frightened of the lady of the cold.

198
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,480
Ah, now it looks frozen.

199
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Wee!

200
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
Yee-hee!

201
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Wee!

202
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
Great, isn't it, movement?

203
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Yeah, that old tree really moves.

204
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
Wanna go?

205
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
No, thanks, I'm too big.

206
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Come on, now the fish soup is ready and it's time you were inside, little my.

207
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
Keep it warm for me, I'm having another go.

208
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,480
No, little my.

209
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Why not?

210
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,480
Have you forgotten what I told you the lady of the cold may be coming?

211
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Oh.

212
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Well, I want to see her, I'm not scared of her.

213
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
I'll be moving so fast she won't get a chance.

214
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,480
No, now listen to me, little my.

215
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,480
All you have to do is not let her look you in the eye.

216
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,480
But what happens if you're not quick enough and she catches you before you turn away?

217
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,480
I know, if we watch her from the bathhouse, she won't see us.

218
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Please, little my.

219
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Come in, she's almost here.

220
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
We can watch it from inside.

221
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
That's no good, I want to see her properly.

222
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
No, little my.

223
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Don't go.

224
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Don't go.

225
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Come back, little my.

226
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
Oh dear.

227
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,480
Come on, let's get back in the cabin before it's too late.

228
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
Wee!

229
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Mom, mom, mom.

230
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,480
Oh, the lady of the cold.

231
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,480
I saw her face, I saw her face.

232
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,480
I saw her and she didn't turn away to eye.

233
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
Press little my to get away with it.

234
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
I don't know how she does it.

235
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,480
I think her nerves are made of steel.

236
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,480
I hope she's on her face.

237
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,480
I saw her face, I saw her face.

238
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,480
I saw her and she didn't turn away to eye.

239
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
I think her nerves are made of steel.

240
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
I hope she's alright.

241
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,480
She should try not to make so much noise out there.

242
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Oh, oh.

243
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

244
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
Oh, oh, oh.

245
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
Yeah, I know her face.

246
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
I know her face.

247
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,480
I know her face.

248
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,480
I know her face.

249
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,480
Oh, oh, oh.

250
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Come on, Mom, we, oh, now just out there.

251
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
So wait a while.

252
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
This is it.

253
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,480
Little boy.

254
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:29,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

255
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Oh, oh, oh.

256
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
Little my.

257
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Little my.

258
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Come on, please.

259
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Wake up, please.

260
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
Oh, please, don't stay frozen, little my.

261
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
Don't worry, little my.

262
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
We'll thought you out.

263
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
Don't worry.

264
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
It's nice and warm here.

265
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,480
Let's go.

266
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
Ow!

267
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
That's hot, moment.

268
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,480
Praise the bull, Bob.

269
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
You come back.

270
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
So little my came back from the cold.

271
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
Little the worse for where.

272
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
The movement need not have worried.

273
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,480
For the little mysers world are practically indestructible.

274
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:12,480
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

275
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:19,480
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

276
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,480
They're always happy and always at play.

277
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,480
The movements are having fun day after day.

278
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,480
The movements.

279
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,480
The movements.

280
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:42,480
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

281
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,480
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

282
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,480
They're always happy and always at play.

283
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,480
The movements are having fun day after day.

284
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,480
The movements.

285
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,480
The movements.

286
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,480
The movements.
