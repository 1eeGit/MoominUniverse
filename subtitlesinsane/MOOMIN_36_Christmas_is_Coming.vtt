    00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Therefore you are your TV.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They are the movements.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So what do you think?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I think it's a good idea.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good They are the movements. They are the movements.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So come with me, give me your hand. I'll take you up to a moment land. You can fly just like a bird.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Sing the best song ever. There were the movements. There were the movements. There were the movements, there was the movements,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
there was the movements, there was the movements,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
there was the movements, there was the movements.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:28.799
The snow was getting thicker on the ground and it was high time for the What are you doing, Neumann? Alicia! What are you doing with these pine needles?

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:38.799
That's what we always eat before we hibernate, nobody knows why.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.799
So you're gonna start hibernating?

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.799
Yes tonight.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.799
Oh, that's soon?

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.799
Yes.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm so glad I've come to see you today instead of leaving until tomorrow then.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I must say you came on just the right day, Alicia.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
We usually have a small party the night we start hibernating,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and you've arrived just in time.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Oh, you mean I can stay for that, woman, mama?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And by the way, Alicia is a matter of interest,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
as to which, sorry, your grandmother, I mean, is the witch, sorry, at your grandmother,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I mean, know that you're here?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
No, I'm afraid I didn't tell her.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Better for grownups not to know too much.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Oh, do you say you're right?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm afraid she's not very happy for me to come here to Moomin Valley.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Why, I have a not my dear.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I guess she's afraid that if I start coming here to play,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I shall lose interest in studying hard at my witchcraft.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.840
Oh, but you've got a very long time to go before you're a witch.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.439
It takes anything between five to seven years, nowadays.

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.599
Are you really sure that's what you want to be, Alicia?

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.080
Study something out.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.560
But I want to be a witch.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.759
Perhaps you don't know, but witches aren't terribly popular.

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:44.360
Yes, I do, but I won't be like that. I'll be popular.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Hey, Snuffkin!

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You're off to the moments?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Yes.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I thought you'd gone south already.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Last winter you'd gone before the snow started.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Not this year, I promised movement.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Promise?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.939
I promised not to leave Moomin Valley

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.840
until he went into hibernation.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.840
Huh.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.280
Everybody seems to be here, and somebody knew...

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.080
Who's that?

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.580
Have a guess.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.080
Hmm.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.080
Very well, then.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.080
It's Alicia, that's my guess.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.580
How did you know?

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.419
What?

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:25.180
I'm right?

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.539
Yes, you are, but I think you peaked and saw her earlier on.

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:29.539
I did it!

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:31.740
I just named somebody I thought couldn't be here!

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.740
Clever, huh?

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.500
Well, she just happened to stop by.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.340
She's with Papa, who's showing her around the house.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.180
Is the witch here, too?

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.780
No, she didn't tell the witch she was coming here.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.780
Just as well, thank goodness.

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.800
Ah, it's you, Snuffkin. I finally came over. I told you I would.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.800
Hi. Remember our friend here? He's called Sniff.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.800
Hi. How do you do Sniff?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.400
Hello. You aren't going to use your magic to cast any spells and stuff, are you?

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.199
No.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.199
Actually they didn't eat just pine needles for dinner that evening. They had lots of other nice things too.

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.199
All cooked by Mum and Mama.

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.000
Snuff can I like to say how story I am.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.800
Why?

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.000
I persuaded you to stay on here instead of going south as you'd planned. I'm leaving tomorrow. But the snow is quite deep. Don't worry, I'm used to deep snow.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I'm just worried Alicia will find it hard to get home in this.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Well, she could spell the night here, but of course tomorrow will be asleep for the winter.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So...

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Huh?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Hmm? Someone's at the door.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I'll see who it is.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.500
I'm going to get a little bit of a room. So... Huh?

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.500
Hmm.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.000
Someone's at the door.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.500
I'll see who it is.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Oh, hello.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
How are you?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.500
Hello and did my young man.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.000
My granddaughter is here, isn't she?

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.120
Who is it then, Momen?

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.079
Oh, my dear.

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.560
You must be Momen Papa.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.279
Now you listen to me, Momen Papa.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:19.600
I don't want my granddaughter playing with your children

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.040
under any circumstances.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.879
Do I make myself quite clear?

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.920
But at least your life's playing with us.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.639
Grandma! We're leaving. Can I make myself quite clear? But Alicia likes playing with us. Grandma!

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:26.720
We're leaving.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.639
Can't I stand a little longer?

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.800
Hello, you're most welcome to stay and have dinner with us.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.519
Don't you know I'm a witch?

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:35.800
I can't eat that sort of baby food.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.160
Alicia quite likes the food.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.600
The pine needles look okay.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.800
The rest is yucky.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.680
Come, Alicia.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.480
Please let me stay, Grandma.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.480
Certainly not, young lady.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.720
I've told you before, which is never mixed with people

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.600
like this, and that goes for novice, which is as well.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.100
Never.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.560
With their knives, they're really all, Grandma.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.759
And I told you, that's the trouble.

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:59.720
They are disgustingly, signally good.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.639
You will hear a lot more about this when we get home.

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.800
Come on now.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.600
It's really cold out here, and there's a lot more snow on the way.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.120
All right, I'm coming, Grandma.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.920
Coming.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.639
Oh, thank you.

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.120
Mum and Papa.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.920
Yeah?

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.279
We understand each other now, don't we?

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.240
I'm sure you understand me.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.680
Never mind about that.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.560
You and your whole family are never

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.339
to speak to my grand-daughter again.

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:26.939
Is that understood?

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:28.600
But Grandma!

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.680
Mind what I say over a venge of touch will come upon you, or even the revenge of a serious.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.560
If you think cheap threats like that impress Moomin Papa, you're making a grave mistake.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.600
Moomin Papa is a highly educated gentleman.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.160
But I am a witch with three diplomas.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
Maybe so. But tell me

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.000
how can three diplomas help you to get home with all this snow.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.920
Ha! Child's play with a cruddy and a witch. Come, Alicia.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.720
I've ever seen one of these before, a little pep square.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:27.000
Is that really a witch's broom? Well, I never. Let's go and see. Drive slowly in this weather. Oh, please don't fall off, Alicia. But terrible chatterboxes you all are.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.439
Please keep quiet all of you.

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:31.680
Are you ready, girl?

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.279
Yeah.

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:34.839
Bet they'll never be able to take off.

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:35.839
Huh?

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:36.360
Oh.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.839
Ah.

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:37.839
Ah.

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:38.839
Ah.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:39.839
Mm.

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:40.839
Ah.

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:41.839
Ah.

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:42.839
Ah.

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:43.839
Ah.

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:44.839
Ah.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.000
Ah. Ah. Ah! Ah!

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Ah!

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Ah!

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Ah!

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Ah!

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
What is it, Grandma?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Nothing!

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Oh!

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Just what I thought, they're too heavy.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Listen, I could take Alicia's place, I'm not too heavy.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Don't worry, I'm happy to walk home, Grandma.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Don't be so ridiculous, child.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
You can't walk home in all this snow.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
You'll never make it.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Only I had some skis.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Come on, climb aboard.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I'll try another spell.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Grandma, are you worried because all those people are watching you?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Shut up!

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And help me say the magic spell.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
What happened?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Oh!

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Oh!

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Oh!

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Oh!

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Oh! They! Oh!

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Let's do it!

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Let's do it!

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Oh!

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Oh!

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
What?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Yeah!

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
What?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Oh!

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Oh!

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Oh!

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Oh!

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Oh!

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Oh!

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Oh!

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Oh!

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Oh!

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Where do we go?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Oh! Oh! going? Oh!

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Oh!

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Oh!

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Oh!

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Oh!

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Oh!

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Oh!

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Oh!

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Oh!

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Oh!

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Stop it, Grandma!

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
She may have three diplomas, but I don't think she's very good, Mama.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.500
I wish they'd sink to the ground so I could fly that broom.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.000
Guess they're all right now, Mum and Papa.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.500
Let's go back to our dinner.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.000
Oh, I forgot to sack them for asking me to stand a dinner.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Thank them indeed. I don't think you're cut out to be a witch.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Oh, but Grandma, I don't want to be one.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Well, I'm quite happy to help with the path.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We'll certainly be a difficult one.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Oh. Oh.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Oh! Grandma!

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:39.600
Oh! Help! With Alessia and the witch gone home to the valley of the witches, Snuffkin departed

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:56.000
for his trip south, and the mmins went into hibernation.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:26.000
They certainly would have slept till the beginning of the spring as usual, but this year... Quite unexpectedly, something happened. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Oh, yeah.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Oh, yeah.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Oh, yeah.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Oh, yeah.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Oh, yeah.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Oh, yeah.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Oh, yeah.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Oh, yeah.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Oh, yeah.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Oh, my God.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Oh, my God.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Oh, my God.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Oh, my God.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Oh, my God.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Oh, my God.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Oh, my God.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Oh, my God.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Oh, my God.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Spring here already?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
There's someone at the window.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
It's frozen shut!

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Oh, no!

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Oh, no!

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Oh, no! Oh, no! It's frozen shut. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Ugh.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Ugh.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Ugh.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Hey.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Hey!

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Why did you wake me up?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Well, you shouldn't be asleep.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Did you know Christmas is coming?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
It's tomorrow, so there's not a minute to be lost.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Christmas is coming tomorrow.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.299
But who on earth is that?

00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:50.299
Why? Who is Christmas? This isn't a joke moment.

00:12:50.299 --> 00:12:56.000
I'm not in the least ready. I've lost my mittens and Christmas is coming and I haven't got a fertry yet.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
A fertry I really must get a fertry.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
How very odd.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Why a fern tree?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Hey!

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Why?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Oh, what's that, moving?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Well, Christmas is almost coming and we don't have a fern tree yet. Christmas?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Hmm. Did you say Christmas is coming?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Yes, and before that, why must have a fern tree?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
What's this about a fern tree? Did you say Christmas is coming? Yes, and before that, one must have a fir tree.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
What's this about a fir tree?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
You need one to protect ourselves against this Christmas person, Mum and Mama.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
I am not really quite clear on that point.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
But there's something awful that has to be kept away, right?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Uh, keep her up.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:56.000
I better go get a firtree.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Ha! About time you've moved, Scotty. How are you, Gafsey?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Pretty good firtree, Dad.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Well, thank you, Gafsey, but could you tell me something?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
What is one supposed to do with it?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
I'm really moving, Papa.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
The way you can joke with such a straight face!

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Joke?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Eh?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
I love to stay, but I haven't even finished cooking yet.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.120
I wasn't joking. No yet Wasn't joking no one believe me either

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:39.340
Would you like a little more young man no, thank you very much. I'm really nice warm again now

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.799
I saw a moment pop I'm moment bring up a big tree

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:45.600
But what is one supposed to do with it?

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.039
Don't you know?

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:48.360
No!

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.240
Why are you decorated as beautifully as you can?

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.559
Really?

00:14:57.039 --> 00:14:59.440
Christmas is coming, so I better be off.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.240
Everyone's talking of Christmas.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.440
By now, I've got a long way to go.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.679
Take care, dear.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:15.440
Hello.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:15.940
Hello.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.120
Bye, bye.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.120
Bye, bye.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.600
Bye. Who was that? I don't know. Bye bye!

00:15:26.799 --> 00:15:31.600
Who was that? I don't know. He was in a hurry to get somewhere before Christmas, so I gave him some tea.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.200
Oh, that was nice.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.600
And he told us what to do with the fur tree.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.200
Hmm, what did he say?

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.200
To decorate it beautifully.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.399
Decorate it, but why should we do that, Mama?

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:46.000
I guess we must decorate the tree to make sure we keep Christmas happy.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Yes, you're right.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
We'd better start doing it right away.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Yes, I'm sure there's not a moment to lose.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
No.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Mama?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Yes, dear.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
They also say we have to cook lots of food for Christmas.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Goodness!

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Well, at least he won't be eating us then. Here.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Thank you, Snork mate. Oh, the ship means rather a lot to me.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
It will look fantastic on the tree, Papa.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:28.200
Yes, dear, I suppose you're right.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.399
Oh!

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:34.799
Why don't we put this at the top?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.200
This is Mars.

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:40.799
Don't worry.

00:16:42.799 --> 00:16:43.399
Hmm, that looks beautiful.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Listen everybody, I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas too. Really mama? I don't wonder what this Christmas will be like.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
What if it's an awful greedy, beastly monster like the grove?

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:08.799
Don't worry Snorkmaiden, we'll give him lots of presents and stuff him full of food.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.799
Have you thought of any presents for Christmas yet? I don't know what to give him.

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:15.000
Look, a seashell.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.599
Oh, that's a beauty.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Oh, look, Mama, what I got for Christmas.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.599
I'm going to give him a pretty lure for fishing.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:28.200
I'm giving him this book.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.799
Oh, great presents.

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:32.400
I'm sure you'll be very happy with the moment family

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.799
and not harmless at all.

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:35.799
Heh heh heh.

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:47.000
I think Christmas will come any moment now.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
So do I.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Oh dear, I do hope he likes my pumpkin pie.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
He will.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Imagine everyone in movement Valley being frightened.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Mmm.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Are you sleepy? Yes, I am. I can't stay this scared for much longer.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Better come before all the food freezes.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Oh!

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
He's coming!

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
I never thought Christmas could be that small.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Merry Christmas!

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
I'm going to have a good time. He's coming!

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
I never thought Christmas could be that small.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Is that what he is?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Well, it's just what you say!

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
All of my life I have dreamed of seeing all this up close, honestly!

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
I never really thought a Christmas tree could be this beautiful!

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.440
Brought my friends too.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.640
You're all very welcome.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.079
Oh, thank you.

00:18:49.079 --> 00:18:50.440
Hear that, everybody?

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.000
We're all very welcome.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.839
Woo!

00:18:52.839 --> 00:18:54.119
Man, let's get them.

00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:55.920
There's some wonderful things here.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.920
Yeah!

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.359
Oh, what a lot of food you've made.

00:19:01.359 --> 00:19:04.119
Yes, all the food there is for Christmas.

00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:07.440
And are those real presents?

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.519
Hey, huh.

00:19:08.519 --> 00:19:10.319
Tell of my life, I've sort of wondered

00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:12.680
about those things called presents.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.720
Papa, I don't think these creatures are Christmas.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.920
Neither do I.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.799
You look sleepy. I am. Must be well past midnight. What is Christmas doing, Mama?

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:37.000
Aren't you sleepy too, little ones?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.400
Sleepy with a wonderful Christmas tree like this to look at?

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.599
Hey, Papa.

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:45.000
What is it? Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Maybe.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Nobody can get really angry this late at night.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Surely we'll close the doors and perhaps we'll be safe inside.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
I'm sure you're right.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Listen, my friends.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
We'd like to give you the tree and the food and the presents.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
What? All of this?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
For us? Yes, we'd like to give you the tree and the food and the presents.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
What? All of this? For us?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Yes, we want to sleep. We're far more sleepy than scared.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Snort, madam.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Oh, I see here yet.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:41.500
No, but we decided to go back to hibernating.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.000
I thought Christmas tree should have a star on top. I don't think it makes any difference, you know.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
A nice rose is just as good as a star.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:18.160
Look at that! And apparently it didn't make any difference at all because the
