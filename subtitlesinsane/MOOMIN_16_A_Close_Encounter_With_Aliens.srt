1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Therefore you are your TV.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So what do you think?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I think it's a good idea.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I think it's a good idea.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:01:43,920

on Earth.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We don't know what they look like, because no one from here has ever seen them.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:25,000
However, we do know that they don't look like this because this is sniff one of woman's friends Whoa! Whoa! Ah!

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Ah!

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Whoa!

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Whoa!

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Ah!

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Ah!

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ah!

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Ah!

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Ah!

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Ah!

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Ah!

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Ah! Ah! Ah!

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Ah!

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hmm.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So it looks as though the rumor was right.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, what rumor was that?

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That we were about to be invaded by aliens from outer space.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Huh? Oh dear, do you mean that thing that was chasing me might have been one of them?

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well yes.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I thought they were just after me.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I wouldn't have thought you'd have been that important to them sniff, but I suppose you never know, knew you.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It says here in this book that aliens from out of space are very civilized and peace loving and would never want to invade us.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,919
It seemed as though they're quite happy where they are.

38
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,319
I do, it's not a very scientific book.

39
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,319
Well, it was definitely attacking me, moment papa, I know it was.

40
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, it might have been a civilization from another planet sniff.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,960
They were just hungry.

42
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,719
Well, the inspector told me that he thought we were being invaded by aliens,

43
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,000
and he shouldn should know.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sure he's exaggerating.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I wonder what they look like.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Why don't you come and help me in the garden?

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You never know, we might see one.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mama, wait for me!

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Mama, what's that? Well, I would say it's not a vegetable that's for sure.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It looks like a flying saucer.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I wonder if there are any aliens in it.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
They might be heard, Mama.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's have a look.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I think there's something there.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This looks odd. I wonder what it is.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's a bit like a radio, isn't it?

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh yeah, an alien radio.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Do you think there's anyone in there, Mumen?

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Anybody there?

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It seems to have been deserted.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
There's a funny noise coming from it.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,560
Well, it doesn't look to me like it could fly again.

63
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,759
It could be repaired.

64
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,160
You'd need to know about flying saucers.

65
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,360
Papa could do it.

66
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,639
I don't think flying saucers should make that sort of noise.

67
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,839
Do you, woman?

68
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,199
I don't think so.

69
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,199
But I don't know very much about them.

70
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,000
It does seem a bit odd as if they've said it to be blown up so that no one would be able to steal it

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,399
because they want to keep the design a secret.

72
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,000
Do you think it will?

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh!

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm not sure, Mama, but let's get away in case it does explore.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's why it's empty, but I wish it hadn't landed in the Asparagus patch.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,199
I'll take the radio with me.

77
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,959
It won't be too long now, Mama. No, it won't.

78
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,439
The blue men.

79
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,839
It's vanished.

80
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,120
Less my soul.

81
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,000
Papa's book said they could be a very advanced life form.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
There's nothing to show it was ever here, except the hole in the ground.

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And this radio thing?

84
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,399
Me, is it a radio, Papa?

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't know. It looks a bit like one.

86
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,000
Let's try pressing one of these buttons.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The red one first, I think. Oh!

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Papa, where have you gone? I'm right here, boom.

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I wonder what happens if I press this one.

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't see you either, dear.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What?

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, I see. Sorry, but I'm afraid I can't see you either, dear. What?

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, I see.

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So if you press the red button, you become invisible. What a fascinating machine.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Papa, I think I'd rather see you, dear.

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, of course you would.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Well, then let's try the yellow one.

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I think.

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Can you see me now?

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No, Papa.

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh, that's hard.

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Do you want me to try Papa?

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Please, Mama.

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There, that's it.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, Papa. That's a very dangerous machine. I don't want to disappear ever again.

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's not a nice experience.

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No, dear.

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I didn't like you vanishing like that.

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We must put it somewhere safe, Mama,

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
where the children can't find it.

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes, dear.

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Mom!

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Snort made it. What an earth for a matter. We found it. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Mom!

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Mom!

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Mom!

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Mom!

118
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Mom!

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Mom!

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Mom!

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Mom!

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Mom!

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Mom!

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Mom!

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Mom!

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Mom!

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Mom!

128
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Mom!

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Mom!

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Mom!

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Mom!

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Mom!

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,680
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Come on!

134
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,319
Where are you going, Moomin, Papa? Going me? Oh, no, Especial.

135
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,720
Moomin, Mama, hang on. I've got a few questions for you.

136
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,679
Really, Inspector?

137
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,759
I was told that a flying saucer had landed in your garden,

138
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,919
but all I can see is a big hole.

139
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,000
Where is it? What have you done with the saucer had landed in your garden. But all I can see is a big hole.

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Where is it?

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,759
What have you done with the saucer?

142
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,840
Nothing.

143
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,039
Well, where is it?

144
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,879
It's not there now.

145
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,840
It was there, but then it just vanished.

146
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,039
Vanished?

147
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,039
Yes, that's right.

148
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,399
When you say vanished, you mean it flew away again?

149
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,279
No, it just went woof, gone.

150
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,200
Moomin saw it too. That's very odd. No, it just went woof. Gone. Moomin saw it too.

151
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,299
That's very odd.

152
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:08,600
Yes, it was.

153
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,000
Did you see any aliens onboard by any chance?

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,200
No.

155
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,100
Are you telling me the truth?

156
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Of course.

157
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,899
Why should I lie to you?

158
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:19,500
Well, I can't.

159
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,700
Think of any reason.

160
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,200
I'm sorry, but it's upsetting aliens

161
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,000
invading Moomin Valley. Yes, it is. Can we go now?

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Certainly.

163
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Where are you all going by the way?

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, only to the beach to collect shells.

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
See you in spags, eh?

166
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Collecting shells indeed while I'm hunting for aliens.

167
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Ah! Over here!

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Look! Look!

169
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I thought you did the thing you know.

170
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't know if I know.

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Is that an alien?

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It certainly is, but not like it says in the book.

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Have you tried talking to it?

174
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,960
Yes, but it wouldn't answer.

175
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,399
Let me try.

176
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,519
Are you from outer space?

177
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,399
Go show Waterley.

178
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,879
Watery, dry sheet, ducky, ducky, ducky, ducky, ducky,

179
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,440
nodding.

180
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,519
Yes, in the gala, ruff, and gala, little bit.

181
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,320
It looks like an alien child to me.

182
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,559
More like a lamp.

183
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,440
Poor thing.

184
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,799
He must be hungry.

185
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,039
Let's take him home.

186
00:10:25,039 --> 00:11:06,500
Yeah, well, we don't want the inspector to see him. That is nothing, snutter, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll love you, l'll I think he's missing his home. Wherever in the universe that might be. I wonder where his parents are.

187
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,000
He can't have come on his own.

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He seems far too little for that.

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,500
Well, I don't know.

190
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
But he's obviously missing them,

191
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
and he seems very unhappy.

192
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,000
Do you think the inspector would really arrest him,

193
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Moon Papa?

194
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Possibly.

195
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He would think it is duty.

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,500
Well, that would be horrible of him.

197
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:46,000
I know. Well, that means trouble. Quick! He can hide in the kitchen. We gotta do something!

198
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And quickly!

199
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I know what to do.

200
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What, Mama? We'll use the machine.

201
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh, yeah! We'll just keep him out of sight.

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Now, then, this one, right?

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh, there.

204
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I think they're here.

205
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, moving papa.

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I heard there was...

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
...a...an alien here with...

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What? What's happening?

209
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What's happened to me?

210
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Goodness, Inspector, you're very shiny.

211
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh dear, yes! How very, very strange!

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,899
You look like a great big glow worm.

213
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,700
An inspector in shining armor, you mean, little my?

214
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,100
That's just what I thought.

215
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,100
You will never need a lamp to be seen, inspector.

216
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
I like it.

217
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,799
Criminals will be afraid of me.

218
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,039
I can't wait to get back to the station

219
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,940
and show the constables.

220
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,940
Handy for reading in bed, too.

221
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:26,000
Well, duty calls. Bye! Oh, you can speak English. Of course I can. It's just that I need my language converted to help me to translate.

222
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And if you hadn't taken it from my ship and hidden it, I would have been able to talk sooner.

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's a good way to learn, isn't it?

224
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Where are you going?

225
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
To see that nice shiny man.

226
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But he'll arrest you!

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He came here looking for you, but he forgot about it when the machine started him glowing.

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No! Don't go there! Hey wait!

229
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I love that light of shimmer. It's just like, oh, it makes me feel really safe.

230
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hello! Hello and spend there!

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes, what is it?

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Take me with you.

233
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What?

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,299
Oh, oh, you're so bright and beautiful in Spector.

235
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:08,019
Oh, you think so?

236
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:10,139
At home, everyone's shimmers like that.

237
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:10,740
Everyone.

238
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,220
Well, that must be very nice for them.

239
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,320
I want to go with you, please.

240
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,259
I'm sorry, I'm too busy, but it was nice talking to you.

241
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,100
You see, the aliens have invaded Movement Valley,

242
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,659
and I must find them.

243
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:25,600
Oh. I just remembered. Aliens have invaded Moomin Valley and I must find them. Ooh.

244
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,799
I just remembered.

245
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:31,200
I was tipped off that there was one of them in Moomin House.

246
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Huh.

247
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,600
The inspector's coming back.

248
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,600
What about the alien?

249
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,000
He's running after him.

250
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Has he been handcuffed, Mumin?

251
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't think so.

252
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Open up in the name of the law, Mumin Papa.

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Well, certainly for you, Inspector.

254
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Come on in. You're very welcome.

255
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Mumin Papa, I have information from a reliable source,

256
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
well, sort of reliable.

257
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That you have been harping a fugitive.

258
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
In other words, I believe you have been hiding an alien here.

260
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, Inspector, I don't think hiding is the right word.

261
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That suggests we are trying to keep something from you.

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Well, Mama.

263
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Would we do that, Inspector?

264
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,679
Hmm, that stinky is tricked me again. Well, Mama? Would we do that, Inspector?

265
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,440
That stinky is tricked me again.

266
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,559
Isn't it lucky he didn't find you? I want a nice inspector.

267
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,600
Look, how many times must I tell you?

268
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,559
He'll lock you up in an nasty cell.

269
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,399
I like him.

270
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,080
I want to see him.

271
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:52,000
No, don't!

272
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Perhaps if we press the yellow button he'll stop sharing. Good idea, Papa. Be quick, Mama.

273
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The yellow button.

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:12,799
Your girls.

275
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You don't want him now that he stopped shining. Do you little fella?

276
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Let's go home then.

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Well, my mama, come and look, we've saved the alien.

278
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,080
Well, my mama, the inspector's not glowing anymore.

279
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,679
Isn't that something?

280
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,679
Mama?

281
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,080
Mama, where are you?

282
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,320
I'm here.

283
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,600
Hey, what?

284
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,000
Where are you, mama? Mama! Right here. Wait, where are you, Mama?

285
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Mama!

286
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Right here.

287
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Mama!

288
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, no, what's happened to you?

289
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't know.

290
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Probably that machine again.

291
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, so it shrinks you as well as making you invisible, does it?

292
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Well, well.

293
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh, dear.

294
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,039
I need an apron Papa can you get

295
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:13,839
a handgrip from my handbag you really are quite small that you look very

296
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,619
cute of course mama would you like to stay like that for a while no I would not

297
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:27,839
push another button quickly before anyone sees me go Go on now hurry up Papa. Yeah oh dear. What's up?

298
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:37,039
The machine's gone. Hey you! Take it, give it back!

299
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:48,000
Don't worry mama, I'll get it back.

300
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Oh, thank you. Oh, look at that, P.

301
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yeah.

302
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Stop him, Moments. Stop him.

303
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
He stole the machine.

304
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
We'll get him, Papa.

305
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Hey, Sniff! Sniff! Don't let Steve get away!

306
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Right!

307
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Mimicery!

308
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh!

309
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Please let me pass, Sniff. I'll give you a gold stopper and...

310
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
A gold stopper?

311
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I mean, Frieden. No, no, five!

312
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Five! No! Give me the machine, Stinky!

313
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh!

314
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh!

315
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Where is it, moment? What's happened to the machine?

316
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's at the bottom of the river, Papa!

317
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Oh, poor Mama! Poor Mama!

318
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,559
What's wrong with her?

319
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,880
Well, she needs the machine to get back to normal.

320
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Normal?

321
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,240
Well, at least this is a chance to do some really fine embroidery.

322
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,319
Don't worry, Mama.

323
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:08,000
I promise we'll look after you. It's alright, Moomin, I'll manage.

324
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'll have to get some smaller pots and pans though, and we'll have to have smaller

325
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
helping, but that might be a bad idea.

326
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Hmm.

327
