101680	113920	la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. It's spring again in
113920	120620	Mumen Valley and after their long winter hibernation, everyone is awake and enjoying the sunshine
120620	123500	in the flowers.
123500	128220	Everyone that is except for mumen was in bed with a terrible cold.
141980	144620	Oh dear mumen, that's a nasty cough.
144620	147180	My throat is very sore.
147180	148380	This will help soothe it.
148380	150940	It's one of grandma's best potions.
154780	155500	It's hard.
155500	158940	Never mind, nice tasting medicines don't always work as well.
162300	164540	I wanted to go out, it's spring.
164540	167740	I know dear, but you'd catch pneumonia or something.
168940	174060	Oh mama, does anyone know why snuff can't come back here?
174780	179020	No, perhaps spring came earlier this year and he wasn't ready.
183020	187020	Snuff can not always come back to mumen valley on the very first day of spring,
188220	189100	but not this year.
194220	195260	Snuff kill.
195260	204940	I'm mumen papa, is mumen any better?
204940	207580	No, I'm afraid not, he's still got a nasty cough.
207580	209180	Can I go up and see him?
209180	210940	No, you'd better not, you might catch it.
216060	219020	Papa's right, sniff, and you know how poorly you get when you're ill.
219020	220460	It's best not to take the risk.
220460	222700	I should think he'll be up and about before very long.
223500	226540	Yes, it's better to be safe than sorry.
226540	228860	Woman shouldn't have gone out in the winter, should he mama?
230620	232540	No, but he couldn't go back to sleep.
232540	234780	Snow would have that effect on anyone.
235740	240700	Not you, little Mai was out in the cold with him and look at her, she seems healthy enough.
243260	245020	I'll take these flowers to mumen later.
245820	247820	Little Mai's too small to catch a cold.
253340	257340	This is boring.
258300	260780	I can't believe that mumen's sick.
260780	262780	And Snuff gets not back either.
263500	265740	I sure wonder what's happened to him.
265740	269340	I bet you mumen gets better as soon as Snuff can arrive in mumen valley.
269900	272380	He's never been this late coming back before.
273660	275420	Perhaps he's got fed up with you guys.
276220	278380	Impossible, he's very fond of me.
278380	280460	He's told me so lots of times.
280540	282380	He likes mumen too, of course.
283260	285420	He might have been captured by a highway man.
286940	288300	Let's go and look for him.
288940	290060	The highway man?
290060	291340	First Snuff can silly.
291340	293420	He's got to come back so mumen will get better.
293420	295020	We must find him.
295020	296620	But where do we look Snork Maiden?
297340	298300	In the south.
298300	299340	It's a big place.
299340	300380	He could be anywhere.
301100	302620	Well, I don't care how big it is.
302620	303740	I'm going anyway.
303740	305020	You're being silly.
305020	305900	No, I'm not.
305900	307500	I don't think your brother will like it.
307500	308700	In fact, I know he won't.
309660	311900	Have you gone completely bananas?
311900	313340	No, I haven't.
313340	315340	And you'll just have to make your own muffins.
315340	317340	There's more to food than muffins.
317340	319580	I was speaking figuratively.
319580	321580	Anyway, I'm going to your brother
321580	323980	and nothing you can do or say will stop me.
323980	325580	It's for mumen.
325580	327820	That's a sort of hairbrain scheme
327820	329580	that could only have been dreamed up by you.
329580	330620	What good will it do?
330620	332220	You don't even know where he is.
332220	333100	It is not.
333100	334780	Mumen is pining for Snuffkin.
334780	336460	Rubbish.
336460	338220	Men don't pine for their friends.
338620	340940	If he isn't back yet, then he isn't coming.
340940	342140	And if he isn't going to come,
342140	343980	what's the point of looking for him?
343980	345420	You won't find him anyway.
347980	350380	He will come when he knows that Mumen is sick.
350380	352220	Black males just like a sister.
353180	355900	Something done for love could never be black male.
355900	358060	Oh no, you're not going and that's fine.
358060	360940	Look, why don't you and little Mai go by yourselves?
360940	363340	Oh, well, I didn't really make a definite decision.
363340	365260	I just sort of said that I might come along
365260	366780	that if Snort Maiden isn't going,
367180	368540	there doesn't seem any point.
368540	369580	Does there?
369580	372940	And I'm not going because I think it's stupid and hairbrain too.
372940	374620	Snuffkin will come back soon.
374620	375820	Not Snort Maiden.
375820	376940	What do you say to that?
384940	387020	How is Mumen feeling any better?
387020	389660	He's asleep now, but the cough doesn't seem so bad.
389660	391660	And is temperature still quite high?
397100	398220	Already.
416460	418140	Snort Maiden Moan.
425500	426500	Snort Maiden.
426780	430780	And my pleas to see you, Moomin.
430780	432780	You look like you needed a lift.
432780	436780	This magic cloud must be one of those we got from the Hobgoblins top hat.
436780	438780	That's right. I hid one of them away.
438780	441780	What a good idea, Moomin. You are clever.
441780	444780	Well, it was so much fun to last time, wasn't it?
444780	447780	Hi, Moomin! Hi! Hi!
447780	451780	Oh, look, Snuffkin. I didn't know they were here, too.
451780	454780	Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
454780	457780	Snuffkin!
457780	460780	Oh! Oh! Oh!
460780	463780	Moomin!
463780	465780	Snuffkin!
465780	467780	Oh, oh!
467780	470780	Oh! Oh!
470780	472780	Moomin!
472780	474780	Snuffkin!
474780	476780	Oh! Oh!
476780	478780	Oh! Oh!
478780	480780	Oh! Oh!
480780	482780	Oh!
482780	484780	That was just a dream.
484780	486780	Snuffkin!
486780	488780	Oh!
492780	494780	You look blousy, Moomin.
494780	498780	Oh, thanks, stinky. You'd better keep away.
498780	501780	There's no need bugs and things like that. Stay away from me.
501780	503780	They're probably frightened of someone so healthy.
503780	506780	Mama isn't letting anyone in here. It's very dull.
506780	508780	You followed a bed or something? Yes, I did.
508780	511780	I know. You were dreaming, weren't you?
511780	513780	Unfortunately, yes.
513780	515780	I know how you feel.
515780	517780	I have that dream a lot.
517780	519780	Oh.
519780	522780	You stand on a windowsill getting ready to break the glass
522780	524780	and inside there's diamonds.
524780	526780	And then, Moomin, you fall.
526780	528780	It's not the same dream at all, stinky.
528780	530780	Snuffkin hasn't come back yet.
530780	532780	Have you heard anything from him? He's very late.
532780	534780	Ah, Snuffkin.
534780	536780	You know something, don't you?
536780	539780	All I know is that he went away as usual last autumn
539780	541780	and hasn't come back yet.
541780	542780	And then...
542780	543780	Yes, what?
543780	545780	Snork Maiden wanted to go looking for him
545780	547780	because he thinks that if Snuffkin comes back,
547780	550780	he won't be sick anymore, but snork with a letter.
550780	553780	Snork Maiden?
555780	557780	Hey, Snork Maiden!
557780	559780	Snork Maiden!
563780	565780	You're not serious, are you?
565780	567780	I feel perfectly all right.
567780	570780	You look like that's warmed up if you ask me.
570780	572780	Thanks a lot.
572780	576780	Now, stinky, tell me which way does Snuffkin normally travel south?
576780	578780	Hey, are you going looking for him?
578780	582780	Yes, it's not really spring in Moomin Valley if he's not around.
582780	584780	It's just not right somehow.
584780	587780	Okay, you're all as mad as each other.
587780	589780	But you'll help me?
589780	591780	I've got to try and find him, stinky.
591780	594780	Yes, all right, but don't tell your parents I helped you.
594780	597780	Don't worry, I want to say a thing.
613780	615780	Sorry, stinky. Are you okay?
615780	617780	No, I'm fine.
618780	622780	Here's your lunch, Moomin. How are you feeling?
622780	624780	Moomin?
624780	627780	Papa, come here quickly.
627780	630780	Mmm.
630780	634780	Oh, Papa, Moomin's gone. He's not in his bed.
634780	637780	Not in his bed? Are you sure, Mama?
637780	642780	Of course I am. His room is empty and there's no sign of him.
642780	644780	Perhaps he's in one of the other rooms.
644780	647780	Don't worry, Mama, I'll find him.
649780	653780	Yo, Moomin.
653780	656780	Moomin.
656780	658780	Hi, Moomin, Papa.
658780	660780	Oh, little Mai.
660780	662780	What's wrong? You look worried.
662780	664780	A moment's gone up somewhere.
664780	667780	I expect you must have gone to look for Snuffkin.
667780	668780	Snuffkin?
668780	671780	Well, you know how crazy Moomin is about him.
671780	673780	Bit stupid if you ask me.
673780	676780	But he's not well, he's got a fever.
676780	686780	You're sure this is the right way?
686780	688780	Of course I'm sure.
688780	691780	I'll see you tomorrow.
691780	695780	Bye.
695780	697780	Bye.
697780	701780	Bye.
701780	705380	Are you sure this is the right way?
705380	707980	Of course I'm sure. I live in this forest, don't I?
707980	709980	Why don't we miss each other somewhere?
709980	712980	Well, if you think you might, don't go then. It's up to you.
712980	714480	But I've got to...
714980	716680	H-h-h-h-h-h-h!
716680	718180	Mumin!
718180	720280	Oh, snorke me, son!
720280	721280	Uh-huh.
721280	722280	Uh-huh.
722280	725280	Where are you taking him, Stinky? You can see he's not well.
725280	729280	I'm not taking him. He insisted on going. I came to look after him.
729280	731280	Is that really right, Mumin?
731280	735080	Yes, I wanted to find snuffkins, so he'd come back.
735080	738080	Well, I was going to find him for you. Little mind's sniff were coming too,
738080	740280	but they chickened out, so I came on my own.
740280	742280	What did Snorke say about that?
742280	743280	I bet he wasn't happy.
743280	745280	Oh, he made a big fuss, and I just let him.
745280	747280	So you just walked out and came on your own?
747280	749280	Brothers, always think they can tell you what to do.
749280	752280	Well, I just ignored him. Did you tell your parents where you were?
752280	754280	Ah, no.
754280	757280	Did you put him up to this stinky? It's just a sort of thing you do.
757280	758280	No, I did not.
758280	760280	That's true, Snark Maiden.
761280	763280	Well, I don't know how you did it stinky, but I know you,
763280	766280	and I know you're to blame, and I don't think I won't find out.
766280	769280	That's not fair, Snark Maiden. It was nothing to do with me at all.
769280	771280	Oh, you're right, Snark Maiden.
771280	774280	He didn't want to show me the way, but I made him.
776280	778280	I'm taking you home.
778280	780280	Oh, but Snark Maiden, look.
780280	782280	No, buts, you're sick, and you should be in bed,
782280	784280	and your parents must be very worried.
784280	786280	Ah, look.
786280	787280	Moomin!
787280	790280	Oh, it's Papa. It isn't that Snark behind him.
790280	792280	Oh, yes, it is.
792280	794280	Oh, oh, it's time I wasn't here.
794280	797280	I'm glad you hadn't gone too far, Moomin.
797280	798280	I might never have found you.
798280	800280	I'm very sorry, Papa.
801280	803280	Ah!
803280	805280	I have a feeling you're behind this stinky.
805280	806280	Come on quickly, I'll win it.
806280	808280	Why doesn't anyone believe me?
808280	810280	It was Moomin's idea. I swear it was.
810280	813280	It was, Papa. I wanted to find Snark Maiden.
814280	816280	Are you all right, Moomin?
816280	818280	Snark Maiden!
819280	822280	Ah, here we go again.
822280	824280	Snark Maiden, what are you doing here?
824280	826280	I thought I told you not to go on this silly jump.
826280	829280	Well, I didn't say I wouldn't. Did I?
829280	831280	Listen to me, Snark.
831280	833280	Ah, you're looking guilty, stinky.
833280	835280	How did you persuade her to disobey me?
835280	837280	See, I told you.
843280	845280	You stay nice and warm in bed, and I'll mix them
845280	847280	of grandma's potion with honey for you.
847280	849280	You'll have to be better soon,
849280	852280	because I have a feeling snuffkins on his way.
857280	859280	My wish snuffkin would hurry up,
859280	861280	then we could all get back to normal at last.
861280	863280	My sentiment's exactly.
864280	866280	So where is Snuffkin?
866280	869280	Well, he's on his way back to Moomin Valley.
869280	871280	But he's had a very long walk,
871280	873280	and is getting very tired now.
886280	889280	Poor Snuffkin, he's had a terrible cold as well,
889280	892280	and is feeling rather weak.
893280	894280	Hello, I know you don't I?
894280	895280	Oh?
895280	897280	Yes, you're snuffkin.
923280	924280	Oh!
935280	938280	Isn't that water still a little cold for that?
946280	948280	You'd better come by the fire and keep warm,
948280	950280	or you'll catch cold.
953280	955280	This is nice!
962280	966280	Just think, I'll be the one that's set by Snuffkin's fire,
966280	969280	and he told me to keep warm and not catch cold.
969280	971280	Hmm, that's no big thing, little fella.
971280	973280	It's a pretty chilly night out here.
973280	974280	Oh, it is!
974280	977280	I've heard so many stories about you from everybody,
977280	979280	and each year I try to watch as you go past,
979280	982280	but I've never been brave enough to talk to you before.
982280	984280	Stories from everybody.
984280	986280	I don't know if I like that.
986280	988280	In fact, I'm sure I don't.
988280	990280	What's your name, little fella?
990280	992280	Oh, well, I haven't got one.
992280	995280	I'm so small that nobody's ever asked me before.
995280	998280	I've always wanted to have a name, you know?
998280	1000280	And it was you who asked me,
1000280	1002280	and I've actually met you and sat next to it.
1002280	1003280	You're countifying!
1003280	1004280	Oh, it's so wonderful!
1004280	1007280	You don't know how happy it makes me meeting you like this!
1007280	1009280	Aw, come on, you do go on a bit old, fella.
1009280	1010280	You just get warm now.
1010280	1011280	Do you think, Snuffkin?
1011280	1013280	Oh, I don't know whether I should ask you.
1013280	1015280	I don't want to offend you.
1015280	1016280	Oh, well, why not?
1016280	1018280	Yes, I will.
1018280	1020280	Perhaps you'd be kind enough to it.
1020280	1022280	I mean, would it be too much trouble for you
1022280	1025280	to think of a name for me?
1025280	1026280	There.
1026280	1030280	I've said it now.
1030280	1032280	Well, choosing a name is important.
1032280	1034280	I'd have to think carefully about that.
1034280	1036280	But it will be easy for you.
1036280	1037280	Now, everything!
1037280	1038280	Now, listen to me.
1038280	1041280	You can't look up to people too much if you want to be yourself.
1041280	1042280	It's not right.
1042280	1044280	But Snuffkin, you're so clever.
1044280	1046280	You can do anything, anything at all.
1046280	1047280	I know you can.
1047280	1052280	I've always wanted to be free like you to do whatever I feel.
1052280	1054280	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm talking too much.
1054280	1056280	I want to listen to you too.
1056280	1058280	All about your travels for a start.
1058280	1061280	I know you're on your way to the Moon Valley to see all your friends.
1061280	1064280	The hedgehog told me the Moon stayed out for most of the winter.
1065280	1067280	Just waiting for you to come back.
1067280	1068280	Now, isn't that wonderful?
1068280	1069280	What?
1069280	1071280	I'd love to have someone that missed me so much
1071280	1073280	they were miserable until I came back.
1073280	1076280	You don't know how lucky you are that you're so special.
1076280	1078280	Well, perhaps I'm not going there.
1078280	1081280	I might have somewhere else to visit instead.
1084280	1088280	Oh, moment, I'll be very sad if you don't go back.
1088280	1091280	Yes, but you've got to have time to be on your own as well.
1091280	1095280	Of course you have, and I've taken up too much of yours now.
1095280	1097280	Wait, I think I'll be off.
1097280	1098280	Okay, thanks.
1103280	1104280	Goodbye, Snuffkin.
1104280	1106280	Good night, little fella.
1106280	1111280	Hey, wait a minute.
1111280	1113280	What about your name?
1113280	1115280	You remembered.
1115280	1119280	Well, what do you think of TD Wu, my friend?
1119280	1121280	Yes, TD Wu.
1121280	1125280	It's nice and happy to start with, and then a little sadness.
1125280	1126280	TD Wu.
1126280	1127280	дом?
1127280	1128280	T-T Wu.
1128280	1129280	T-T Wu.
1129280	1130280	T-T Wu.
1130280	1132280	T-T Wu.
1132280	1135280	T-T Wu.
1135280	1137280	T-T Wu.
1137280	1140280	T-T Wu, T-T Wu.
1140280	1142280	T-T Wu.
1142280	1144280	T-T Wu.
1144280	1146280	T-T Wu.
1146280	1148280	T-T Wu.
1148280	1149280	T-T Wu.
1149280	1151280	T-T Wu.
1151280	1156280	Oh, that's great! It's a wonderful name, Titi Woo!
1156280	1161280	Titi Woo, I'm glad you like it. It's the first time I've ever given anyone a name.
1162280	1169280	Yeah! I think I'll be able to house and then I can put up a real name plate that says Titi Woo!
1169280	1172280	Ah, good idea, Titi Woo. About what I said before.
1172280	1173280	Huh?
1173280	1179280	You know, not going back to Moomin Valley? Well, I am. I've missed Moomin and all my friends.
1180280	1187280	Oh, I didn't take that seriously. You just got upset at something I said. I'm afraid that happens a lot. I guess I talked too much.
1187280	1188280	Maybe you do.
1188280	1194280	Oh, I'll be going back to Moomin Valley a bit behind schedule. And this year's spring came along early too.
1194280	1198280	But I suppose it's better late than never, as they say.
1198280	1202280	Moomin will be happy. Say hello to everyone from Titi Woo!
1202280	1206280	I will. And I'll tell them how it came about.
1206280	1211280	That's where you keep your harmonica, isn't it, Snuffkin? It's really famous, you know?
1211280	1213280	I didn't realize that.
1213280	1216280	Do you know? I've never ever heard any music.
1220280	1222280	Really? What would you like me to play?
1222280	1226280	Anything. Oh, I know. What about Moomin's favorite?
1236280	1240280	Oh, that's Snuffkin!
1267280	1268280	Oh, God!
1278280	1280280	Don't move!
1293280	1295280	Snuffkin!
1296280	1298280	Snuffkin!
1318280	1323280	Now at last, spring really has come to Moomin Valley.
1324280	1331280	They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.
1331280	1338280	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.
1338280	1342280	They're always happy and always at play.
1342280	1349280	The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.
1349280	1359280	They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.
1359280	1367280	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.
1367280	1371280	They're always happy and always at play.
1371280	1378280	The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.
1379280	1382280	The Moomin's.
1382280	1388280	The Moomin's.
