00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with

00:21.000 --> 00:30.800
me here for you on your TV they are the moments they are the moments so come

00:30.800 --> 00:37.600
with me give me your hand I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just

00:37.600 --> 00:45.040
like a bird sing the best song ever there were the moments there were the

00:45.040 --> 00:58.180
moments there was the moments there was the moments there was the moments

01:15.040 --> 01:45.040
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

01:45.040 --> 01:57.920
la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la lㅋㅋㅋㅋ

01:58.920 --> 02:03.840
papa, I think that rope is getting loose. Okay momen, you'd better have a look before this wind has the whole tent down.

02:03.840 --> 02:07.560
me yes captain

02:07.560 --> 02:10.560
The sudden storm has hit the hafifat in his island.

02:16.560 --> 02:20.560
Moomin Papa has decided that it would be far safer to stay the night on the island,

02:20.560 --> 02:23.560
so they put up the tent and moored the boat.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.560
This will show us what the weather's up to.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.560
That's as long as it's still working.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.560
I'm sure it's going to die down really soon.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.560
Oh, wake up, Mr. Hemelon.

02:43.560 --> 02:48.560
When the storm clears, we must give this barometer straight back to the hafifatness.

02:48.560 --> 02:53.560
Oh, I quite fancy keeping it myself to remind me of the island.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.560
You know, it seems to work after all.

02:55.560 --> 03:00.560
But Mr. Hemelon, that'll only remind you of the horrible hafifatness.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.560
What about all the tons of plants you've found?

03:02.560 --> 03:05.560
That surely is going to be enough?

03:05.560 --> 03:10.560
Yes, I know, but there was only really one special flower amongst all those plants,

03:10.560 --> 03:12.560
and I nearly missed that one.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.560
Look, isn't it a beauty?

03:14.560 --> 03:17.560
I discovered it as I was about to tie up the boat.

03:17.560 --> 03:19.560
Oh, Moomin Papa.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.560
Yes, Mr. Hemelon.

03:21.560 --> 03:28.560
You know when you all went to put up the tent, you told me to tie up the boat so she was safe.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.560
Yes, of course.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.560
Well, I'm not sure if I did.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.560
Not sure at all.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.560
Please try to remember Mr. Hemelon.

03:38.560 --> 03:42.560
I can't, it's all very unclear in my mind.

03:42.560 --> 03:46.560
If the boat's not here, we'll be stuck on the island forever and ever.

03:46.560 --> 03:52.560
Well, we pulled it well ashore so it should be okay, but we'd better check on it as soon as we can.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.560
I'll go have a look.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.560
Quickly, Moomin, be careful.

03:58.560 --> 04:02.560
I remember I was just going to do it when I spotted this flower.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.560
Just by a rocket was whole dear.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.560
Moomin.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.560
Boy, that was close.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.560
Tie it to the tree and make sure it's tight.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.560
Oh, that should do it.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.560
Just in time.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.560
You know the waves must have been huge to reach this far.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.560
Well, we saved the boat.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.560
Yes.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.560
Well, this storm will be over soon.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.560
Is everything okay?

04:52.560 --> 04:54.560
Yep, everything's fine.

04:54.560 --> 04:58.560
Oh, thank goodness, so we're not stranded after all.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.560
Huh? No.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.560
We needn't have worried.

05:02.560 --> 05:06.560
I'm very sorry, really I am.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.560
Are you alright, Snort Maiden?

05:09.560 --> 05:11.560
Now I am.

05:22.560 --> 05:31.560
According to this, the storm is blowing over now and it should stop raining soon.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.560
Well, the wind seems to have dropped.

05:33.560 --> 05:37.560
Oh, good. All that thunder and lightning is so noisy.

05:37.560 --> 05:43.560
Ah, right. I think I'll just go for a bit of a walk before I settle down for the night.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.560
But it's much too dark to see anything.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.560
The fresh air will do me good.

05:50.560 --> 05:54.560
Oh, that's a good idea.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.560
I could do with some fresh air myself.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.560
Wait for me. I'll come too.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.560
Let me increase the water.

06:01.560 --> 06:05.560
There's still there hundreds of them all glowing.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.560
The Hattie Fat News.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.560
They're waiting for us.

06:10.560 --> 06:20.560
The lightning must have recharged them.

06:20.560 --> 06:26.560
Look at them all. I wonder what they want, Snort Maiden.

06:26.560 --> 06:30.560
Such a heavy storm would have given them lots and lots of energy.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.560
Gosh, they're ready for anything.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.560
They're not coming any closer.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.560
They seem fairly friendly. Maybe they just want to see what we look like.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.560
No, I know what they're here for.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.560
Oh, what's that, Snuffkin?

06:42.560 --> 06:44.560
It's their barometer, Moomin Papa.

06:44.560 --> 06:49.560
They know we've got it and they've come to get it back from us.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.560
Yes, I think you're right, Snuffkin.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.560
Mr. Hamilton?

06:54.560 --> 06:57.560
I do think you'd better give it back to them.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.560
Do I have to?

06:59.560 --> 07:06.560
Yes, of course. After all it is there isn't there are a lot of them.

07:06.560 --> 07:11.560
Look, why don't you take it out to them now?

07:14.560 --> 07:18.560
You know the barometer does belong to the Mr. Hamilton.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.560
Oh, dear, dear.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.560
Give it to me.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.560
Let me do it, Papa.

07:25.560 --> 07:29.560
Well done, my boy.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.560
You must be careful, my dear.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.560
Don't worry, Mama.

07:33.560 --> 07:36.560
Boy, isn't he brave?

07:59.560 --> 08:02.560
I think this is what you've come for.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.560
Here you are. You can have it back now.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.560
Moomin!

08:20.560 --> 08:24.560
Moomin! Are you all right, Moomin?

08:24.560 --> 08:26.560
I'll tell you something.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.560
I'm real glad there's no electricity where we live.

08:29.560 --> 08:33.560
Oh, they didn't hurt you, did they?

08:33.560 --> 08:35.560
Ah! Go away!

08:35.560 --> 08:37.560
They were alone.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.560
Are you all right, Moomin?

08:41.560 --> 08:43.560
I'll tell you something.

08:43.560 --> 08:46.560
I'm real glad there's no electricity where we live.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.560
Oh, they didn't hurt you, did they?

08:48.560 --> 08:50.400
Are you all right, Snorgmaiden?

08:50.400 --> 08:51.760
What did he do to you?

08:51.760 --> 08:54.200
Just a bit of shock, that's all.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.880
What's that funny smell?

08:56.880 --> 08:57.880
Huh.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.080
Oh my god, it's your hair.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.080
What?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.240
What do you mean?

09:05.960 --> 09:07.760
What's happened to it?

09:07.760 --> 09:08.720
Oh no, my hair.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.520
Mama, mama!

09:10.520 --> 09:11.760
Where's your mirror?

09:11.760 --> 09:12.640
Oh, mama.

09:12.640 --> 09:16.360
Oh, look at what those wicked, hatty fat nurse have done.

09:18.560 --> 09:21.080
It's here in my handbag somewhere.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.280
Hurry, mama!

09:22.280 --> 09:24.560
I must see what's happened to my hair.

09:24.560 --> 09:25.800
Here you are, dear.

09:27.240 --> 09:28.440
Look at me!

09:28.440 --> 09:29.840
Look at me!

09:29.840 --> 09:31.040
It's awful!

09:32.840 --> 09:33.840
It's horrible!

09:33.840 --> 09:34.600
It's horrible!

09:34.600 --> 09:36.840
Don't worry, we'll put some magic ointment on

09:36.840 --> 09:39.000
and it'll come back all lovely and curly.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.520
I don't want nasty curly hair.

09:41.520 --> 09:45.280
I want my long, beautiful hair like it was before.

09:45.440 --> 09:49.760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

09:49.760 --> 09:53.280
Do you know it really doesn't matter to me, Snort Major?

09:53.280 --> 09:58.640
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.520
Gun.

09:59.520 --> 10:00.360
Oh, good.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.680
I hope that's the last we see of them.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.440
Oh dear, what's happened to Snort Major?

10:06.440 --> 10:26.440
My hair, my hair, where's my hair?

10:26.440 --> 10:31.440
My hair, my hair, where's my hair?

10:56.440 --> 11:06.440
My hair, my hair.

11:26.440 --> 11:41.440
Wake up, woman. We got hurry.

11:57.440 --> 12:01.440
My wonder where they're going.

12:01.440 --> 12:04.440
Perhaps they're sailing away to a secret island.

12:04.440 --> 12:12.440
Somewhere very far away from here where they can live happily on their own together.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.440
Gosh, napkin, they're really weird.

12:15.440 --> 12:18.440
Well, it depends on how you look at a woman.

12:18.440 --> 12:25.440
They probably think we're a bit strange, too.

12:32.440 --> 12:36.440
Snuffkin, you're really horrible. You knew I wanted to see them.

12:36.440 --> 12:39.440
Come on, you were fast asleep snoring your head off.

12:39.440 --> 12:43.440
That wasn't me snoring. That was Mr. Himulin.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.440
All right. If you say so.

12:46.440 --> 12:49.440
Well, I hope that's the last I'll see of them.

12:49.440 --> 12:53.440
Me, too. That's a very pretty scarf snort made of.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.440
Yes, it is, isn't it?

12:55.440 --> 12:57.440
Can we go exploring, Mama?

12:57.440 --> 12:59.440
I don't see why not.

12:59.440 --> 13:02.440
It looks as though it'll be a nice day,

13:02.440 --> 13:06.440
and there'll be lots of exciting things washed up by the storm.

13:06.440 --> 13:10.440
Oh, that'll be fun. Let's look for the other side of the island.

13:10.440 --> 13:14.440
What a good idea. I might discover some more plants.

13:16.440 --> 13:23.440
Mr. Himulin, hurry up, sir, or it will be dark before we get there.

13:23.440 --> 13:28.440
Ah, you go on, Momen. I just want to have a better look at these flowers.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.440
Yes, all right.

13:31.440 --> 13:36.440
Very interesting.

13:36.440 --> 13:40.440
Just think.

13:41.440 --> 13:45.440
Very interesting.

13:45.440 --> 13:50.440
Just think. We could find all sorts of things lying on the sand.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.440
I hope in secret, sunken treasure.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.440
Well, let's hope it's not sunken anymore.

13:55.440 --> 13:59.440
I expect there'll be lots and lots of treasures from shipwrecks and things like that.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.440
But I find it before you.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.440
Oh, no, you won't.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.440
Look at all this. It's all mine.

14:13.440 --> 14:17.440
I'm going to dive in.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.440
What's that over there?

14:20.440 --> 14:23.440
It's quite shallow right here.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.440
Well, there must be something admit it.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.440
Oh, dear, it's empty.

14:28.440 --> 14:32.440
I think I found something here.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.440
Little lie, little lie.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.440
What's a matter?

14:40.440 --> 14:43.440
Come and see these beautiful shells I have.

14:43.440 --> 14:47.440
I'm too busy hunting for treasure to bother with shells.

14:55.440 --> 14:58.440
Hey, what's this?

15:04.440 --> 15:06.440
Oh, look at this one.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.440
I've got a real collection here.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.440
Lovely and mama's garden.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.440
Wow, watch that.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.440
What?

15:21.440 --> 15:24.440
I can't find any as nice as yours.

15:24.440 --> 15:27.440
Don't be in such an awful hurry, little lie.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.440
Snark maiden!

15:29.440 --> 15:32.440
Snark maiden! Look! Look what I found.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.440
A proper treasure.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.440
Look!

15:38.440 --> 15:42.440
Oh, there's snow inside of it.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.440
I found it in a cave.

15:45.440 --> 15:48.440
What is it?

15:48.440 --> 15:50.440
What's this?

15:50.440 --> 15:52.440
It's a ship telescope.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.440
You can see for miles with it.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.440
I'll give it to Papa.

15:56.440 --> 16:00.440
It's better than anything I got.

16:00.440 --> 16:04.440
Hey, everybody, I found something.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.440
Come on up and have a look.

16:06.440 --> 16:09.440
I wish I could find something interesting.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.440
Have you found some buried treasure?

16:21.440 --> 16:24.440
What a big lady. Is she dead?

16:24.440 --> 16:26.440
It's made of wood, Snark maiden.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.440
It's a figurehead from a ship.

16:37.440 --> 16:42.440
She's like a queen.

16:42.440 --> 16:46.440
Ha, she hasn't got any legs, though.

16:46.440 --> 16:50.440
Why don't we put her on the front of our boat?

16:50.440 --> 16:52.440
Nah, it's much too heavy.

16:52.440 --> 16:55.440
It must have come from a ship that was wrecked.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.440
And sank and sea?

16:58.440 --> 17:01.440
Perhaps it did.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.440
And all hands were lost.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.440
I want to take it home.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.440
What would you do with it?

17:08.440 --> 17:13.440
Use it to frighten people away.

17:13.440 --> 17:17.440
Help! Somebody help me, please!

17:17.440 --> 17:19.440
That's old, Mr. Hamilton.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.440
Gosh, I hope it's not more haddy fattiners.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.440
Someone help, please!

17:24.440 --> 17:27.440
We're coming!

17:34.440 --> 17:38.440
Woman, why do you like this old figurehead so much?

17:38.440 --> 17:40.440
You're staring at her.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.440
She's not all that special, you know?

17:42.440 --> 17:44.440
Yes, I know.

17:44.440 --> 17:48.440
She's not even real. Only made of wood.

17:48.440 --> 17:49.440
Ah.

17:49.440 --> 17:52.440
Do you like her eyes?

17:52.440 --> 17:54.440
Or is it her hair?

17:54.440 --> 17:57.440
Just because I haven't got any?

17:57.440 --> 17:59.440
Nearly there, just a bit further.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.440
Come on, snuff it for me.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.440
For her, if you want.

18:06.440 --> 18:09.440
You're very heavy, Mr. Hamilton.

18:11.440 --> 18:14.440
Thank you, snuff kid. You saved my life.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.440
Boy, how'd you end up there, Mr. Hamilton?

18:19.440 --> 18:23.440
One minute, I was looking for plants the next I'd fall and right into that hole.

18:23.440 --> 18:27.440
I think you'd be safe for collecting stamps, Mr. Hamilton.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.440
Oh no, it's not here. Where is it?

18:31.440 --> 18:33.440
What is it now?

18:33.440 --> 18:36.440
Tell me.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.440
Make a move and preserve me.

18:38.440 --> 18:42.440
Calm down, Mr. Hamilton. Tell me what's the matter?

18:42.440 --> 18:46.440
My sample box, my sample box. Oh my goodness.

18:46.440 --> 18:48.440
You didn't leave it in the hole, did you?

18:48.440 --> 18:52.440
Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you. Oh dear.

18:52.440 --> 18:57.440
All my precious samples, I'm so silly. Oh, snuff kid.

18:57.440 --> 19:01.440
Oh, snuff kid, would you mind?

19:01.440 --> 19:04.440
Okay, anything for some peace.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.440
Oh dear boy, you are wonderful.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.440
You shall have one of my rarest plants as a reward.

19:09.440 --> 19:13.440
And indeed you shall, I shall choose a magnificent one for you.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.440
Thank you very much, Mr. Hamilton.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.440
Gosh, your one-room movement is.

19:20.440 --> 19:23.440
Oh, there you are. What have you been up to?

19:23.440 --> 19:26.440
He can't take his eyes off that silly wooden lady.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.440
He just stares at her.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.440
Really?

19:29.440 --> 19:33.440
I do not. I just think she has a very beautiful face.

19:33.440 --> 19:38.440
Well, woman, now that you're here, I could really do with your help.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.440
What do you want, snuff kid?

19:40.440 --> 19:44.440
Mr. Hamilton dropped his box of samples down this hole and I'm going to try and get it.

19:44.440 --> 19:49.440
I didn't drop it. I fell in the hole and just forgot it when Stuffkin pulled me out.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.440
You're a bit absent-minded, Mr. Hamilton.

19:51.440 --> 19:56.440
No, I'm not. I can remember every Latin name of every single plant, you know.

19:56.440 --> 20:00.440
Okay, I'll go down, woman, but you'll have to help me get back up.

20:00.440 --> 20:01.440
Okay.

20:01.440 --> 20:06.440
I'll help you too. Now be careful. Can you see it yet, Snuffkin?

20:06.440 --> 20:08.440
I'm not down at the bottom yet.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.440
Oh, forgive me. I'm sorry.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.440
I found it.

20:12.440 --> 20:16.440
Wonderful. Tell me, are the plants all right?

20:16.440 --> 20:19.440
You can check them yourself in a minute.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.440
Oh.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.440
Are you all right, Snuffkin?

20:27.440 --> 20:32.440
Wait a minute. I found something else.

20:32.440 --> 20:38.440
Oh, look. There's the boat. It's moment, moment, moment, Papa.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.440
Hello.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.440
It's gold.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.440
Hello. We've been hunting treasure.

20:52.440 --> 20:55.440
Go and get movement, Papa. I found gold.

20:55.440 --> 20:58.440
Boy, oh, boy, I wonder how much there is.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.440
Moomin, Papa, we'll know.

21:09.440 --> 21:13.440
Well, Moomin, Papa, what should we do with all this beautiful gold?

21:13.440 --> 21:16.440
It would look lovely in the garden, don't you think?

21:16.440 --> 21:21.440
With all the shells that the snorkemaiden found, they'll look over it in amongst the roses.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.440
What do you think, Mama?

21:23.440 --> 21:25.440
I'm sure they will, Papa.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.440
I'm sure they will.

21:31.440 --> 21:34.440
Moomin, she's only a stupid, legless doll.

21:34.440 --> 21:37.440
You can have my bowl full of snorkemaiden.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.440
No, thanks.

21:39.440 --> 21:43.440
Well, I'll look after it for you. I can pretend it's my treasure.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.440
Oh.

21:47.440 --> 21:53.440
And that was the end of their first adventure in the new boat.

21:53.440 --> 21:59.440
Moomin, Papa, decided that it was much more fun to set off without maps and sea charts.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.440
You never know where you might end up.

22:07.440 --> 22:14.440
They love the laughter and they love the living, the moments.

22:14.440 --> 22:21.440
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:21.440 --> 22:25.440
They're always happy and always at play.

22:25.440 --> 22:29.440
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:29.440 --> 22:32.440
The movements.

22:32.440 --> 22:36.440
The movements.

22:36.440 --> 22:43.440
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

22:44.440 --> 22:51.440
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

22:51.440 --> 22:55.440
They're always happy and always at play.

22:55.440 --> 22:59.440
The movements are having fun day after day.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.440
The movements.

23:02.440 --> 23:06.440
The movements.

23:06.440 --> 23:12.440
The movements.

23:14.440 --> 23:19.440
The movements.
