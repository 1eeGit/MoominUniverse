Here they are for one and all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The movements are about to come.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They're for you on your TV.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They are the movements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They are the movements.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, what do you think?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm not sure.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm not sure.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.640
I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. with me, they're for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

Where are you, Moomin? It's Nork Maiden!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The rhino and the tigers that stinky set free from the zoo are now living in the jungle

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that has grown up around Moomin house and have settled into the restful life of Moomin Valley.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Hey, have you seen Moomin?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
No, you haven't seen him all evening.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Hmm.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I wonder where they got to.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Meanwhile, Moomin and Snorkmaiden chased by the snake

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and are swimming as fast as they can out to sea.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I can't swim another.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Soon most noteworthy you must.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Hey! Hey you there! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, The hippos reported missing from the zoo lately. Just a bit further, Snorke made it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We made it.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I didn't know hippos could climb so well.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Oh, thank you so much.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
There was a huge snake chasing us.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.439
Yes, we saw you were lucky we came along when we did.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.080
Thank you for your help. Who's ship is this?

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.840
ours. We're from the zoo.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.840
The zoo?

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.080
Oh, you've got one of the crocodiles.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.639
Yes, and a lot of trouble he gave us as well.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.520
There's another one around here somewhere. We saw them.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.879
Yes, we know there is, but we haven't been able to find him yet.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.000
Oh, boy. I wish they'd come as quietly as you hippos did.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Hippos? Hippos?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Which do you from? I bet they'd pay well to get you back.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Now look here, I'm a Mormon, not a hippo.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Are you saying that I look like a hippo?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Well, perhaps they don't look exactly like hippos.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
No, but they're close enough, Captain.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.939
I'm sure they've escaped from Azoo somewhere, though.

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:47.939
Yes, sir.

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.139
We haven't escaped from anywhere, certainly not Azoo.

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.340
We live in Moomin Valley. We're Moomin's.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.180
It's all right, Snork Maiden. I'll not be taken for a hippo.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.780
Come on, let's run for it.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.479
Hey, wait. There's a nice cozy cage already for ya.

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.780
Hurry, Snork Maiden.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.379
Ask to them.

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.560
Stop them now. Don't let them get away.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.400
Where are we going, Mumin?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.000
Now to the sea.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.800
Quickly, man, lower the light boat.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.800
If they're not going to put us in any zoo.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.000
Why did you come back? I thought you were on the boat.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Oh no! Don't worry, I never read anything when I'm not swimming.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Are you sure? I'm sure I know where's this ship.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Oh, they're catching up with us. They want to put us in a cage and take us to the zoo.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Me too, I expect. They're always trying to get me.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
They've got one of the crocodiles. Oh, did they? They were my friends. Right. Hang on to me, I expect. They're always trying to get me. They've got one of the crocodiles.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Oh, did they? They were my friends.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Right. Hang on to me, you two.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.500
I'm certainly not going back to any zoo.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.000
Never, let's go.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Oh no!

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Hold on tight.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Come back! You horrible rascal! Come back!

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.000
Moments been caught by a big snake. Yes, Mama snorked maiden as well.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.500
Dear stinky that's not true is it?

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.000
I wish people wouldn't realize that I almost never lie. I'm sorry about them, but I thought I'd better tell you.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Oh, there aren't any snakes that big in Momen Valley.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.459
There are tigers here right there. Well, there's big snakes too.

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:28.040
You brought the snake here, didn't you?

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.839
Papa, I'm not saying that I believe him, but I think we'd better look for them just to be on the safe side, don't you?

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:38.379
Okay, don't believe me. I told you so my conscience is clear.

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:40.959
We're exactly to the snake attack them, Stiggy.

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:43.000
Down in the swamp by the sea.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.459
Let's go, mama.

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:48.279
I'll come with you. No, you'd better stay little my until

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:53.399
I'm moving where we've gone if he comes back. He'll only worry if there's no one here.

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:56.040
And stinky, you show us where to go.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:26.000
Okay. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Big friend, please come in as much of you as you like. Stinky just told us that you and Snorkman

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
had been caught by a big snake, so we...

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Where are you going, Stinky?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
She did chase us at first, then we managed to get on a boat,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
but they wanted to put us in a cage,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
so we jumped back in the sea, met the snake again,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
then they tried to catch her too,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
so she helped us to get away, and now she's our friend.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Who are they?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.459
Men from the zoo.

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:50.660
They've come to recapture all the animals and take them away from the jungle and put them in cages again.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.860
Nice.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.860
Secondly, don't want to go back to the zoo.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.360
Papa, we've got to protect our friends.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.860
Yes, we have.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.500
I'm sure that the tigers and that nice rhino don't want to go back even.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.500
Oh, of course they don't.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.439
They want to be free and live again our jungle. Why don't you go and explore it? I'm sure it'll to go back even. Oh, of course I don't. They want to be free and let begin our jungle.

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:08.040
Why don't you go and explore it?

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.000
I'm sure it'll be just like home.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.079
And if you see the zoo people, you can come back here,

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:14.079
cut you.

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:16.480
I'm sure you'll like it here, Mrs. Snake.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.600
Yes, I'm sure I will.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.839
Come on, I'll show you the jungle.

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:23.839
Eh.

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:27.360
I'm so relieved that you're both all right at home.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.920
So are we, Mama, but there's something we haven't told you.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.199
Yes, they thought we were hippopotamuses.

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:35.040
What?

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.879
Who did?

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:38.480
They need their eyes, Destin.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.079
The men from the zoo.

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:41.959
They thought we had escaped from another zoo,

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:48.639
and we're trying to catch us, and they nearly succeeded. Now, a rude, well not at all like hippos, the cheek of it.

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:53.920
So these men were only trying to capture our new friends, but you and Snork Maiden as well.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.120
And me and Papa if they'd known about us?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.279
That's right, Mama.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:58.339
There idiots.

00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:03.360
Hippopotamuses don't wear aprons or right memoirs. That's really made me angry.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.199
I bet they never faced the wrath of a movement papa before.

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:12.079
I want to see you wrap yourself round and choke somebody.

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:14.120
I know, how about the tiger?

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.439
He do.

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:20.240
I'd rather not, we became friends in the zoo.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.439
Oh, I know, choke stinky, that would be much better.

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:26.560
Yes, my dewey did let us out of the zoo!

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:33.440
Well, you're a great disappointment to me. I let you out because I thought you'd attack the movements,

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.799
but you have tea with them instead. You're pathetic, you know that?

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:41.679
I'm sorry, but we were brought up in captivity, and we never had to hunt for our food.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.919
All our meals are brought to us, you see.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.480
But your tigers, what do you eat, them?

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.120
Well, we love cat food.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.879
Cat food.

00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:54.039
Oh, I don't believe it.

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:57.240
Yes, it's easy to chew, and it leaves our fur all sleep

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.919
and shiny.

00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:59.759
We like the yellow tins with the black cat.

00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:00.799
Don't we, honey?

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:02.279
Yes, it's our favorite.

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:05.000
You wouldn't happen to have any on you, would you?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Mama! Pop-, quickly!

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
They're here! The zoo men are here!

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Get all the animals into the house first, you!

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Hurry, moment!

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Okay, Papa.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
The zoo men have come to get you!

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Hurry, you'll be safe in the moment house.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Quick as you can, Rhino, into the house.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Go on.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Now, Rhino, push him.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I'm sorry. Oh, my God.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Um, I don't think that's a good place to hide, Mrs. Snake.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I'm afraid that doesn't look quite right, Tiger. I thought I might just look like a thick rug.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I'll just lie here like a beautiful porcelain ornament.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
They'll never know we're here, darling.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Well, they'd never expect to find a rhino under there.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
That's what I thought.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Where are they?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
They can't just have vanished into thin air.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Hmm. Look, up there!

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
In the chimney.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So they're in there, are they? Papa! They've seen the snake! They're nearly here!

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Now I want you to calm down and be quiet, everyone.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
We won't let them take you away. I promise you they'll have a fight on the hands if they try.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Teeth, please, my love.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Of course, dear. We won't let them take you away. I promise you they'll have a fight on the hands if they try.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Teeth, please, my love.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
A poor steer.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Hello?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Hello? Hello. Hello. Hello.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Hello.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Hello.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Having a picnic are you?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
It's lovely day for you.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Not at all. We're all here from the zoo, sir.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Oh, are you on some sort of expedition?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.039
Excuse me, but are you the owner of this house?

00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:07.519
Yes, indeed I am. I'm movement pop-o.

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:09.720
Well, why could I do for you?

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.320
Why, you could send out the animals hiding in your house.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.080
That'll do for a start.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.120
Animals?

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.879
Oh, no. We have firm believers that they belong outside.

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:20.600
Sir, you can't see from where you are,

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.879
but I can assure you that there is a python

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:26.200
sticking its head out of your chimney. A python?

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.700
Yes, that's right.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.399
No, it isn't.

00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:30.700
It isn't.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.700
No, it's my daughter.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.700
She happens to look like a python.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.200
Not all the time you understand.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.200
Right, come on, man.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.200
We'll go and get the zoo's property.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.700
No, you will not enter my house.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.000
All right, well, you let the animals out. We won't have to.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
It's up to you, sir.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
There are no animals, and you won't enter my house.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Now, wait a minute.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I do believe, yes, you're one of those hippos, aren't you?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I am not.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
I'm movement papa, and I am the owner of this house.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
No, you're not.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
You're a hippopotamus.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
How dare?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
A hippo who owns a house, and it's also running an illegal zoo.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.840
Break down the doors. You're not your hippopotamus, how dare? A hippo who owns a house, and it's also running in an illegal zoo!

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.440
Break down the doors!

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.039
Huh, that is against the law!

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:12.039
Oh it is, isn't?

00:13:12.039 --> 00:13:16.279
Well, there's a nice cage winning for you as well, woman, pop a hippo.

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:19.840
I warn you, if you touch that door, you'll regret it.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.639
Go, yeah?

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:24.759
Great boys, let's go in!

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:25.720
Charge!

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.720
Oh!

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.559
Oh!

00:13:27.559 --> 00:13:28.399
Oh!

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:29.240
Oh!

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.080
Oh!

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.080
Oh!

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.080
Oh!

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.080
Oh!

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.080
Oh!

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.080
Oh!

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.080
Oh!

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.080
Oh!

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.080
Oh!

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.080
Oh!

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.080
Oh!

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.080
Oh!

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.080
Oh!

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.080
Oh!

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.080
Oh!

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.000
Oh! Oh! Oh! God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Oh, my God!

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Oh, my God!

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Oh, my God!

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Oh, my God!

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Oh, my God!

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Oh, my God!

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Oh, my God!

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Oh, my God!

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Oh, my God!

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.500
Oh, my God! Oh, have you know that's willful destruction of property, my good man?

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.940
It's not willful, we're from the zoo. We gotta get in somehow.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.000
Oh, have you, and can you be sure that there are zoo animals in there?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.240
You just take a look up there at the chimney. That's all I'm sure.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.279
Go on.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.960
See that python's head sticking out?

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.000
That's all. I can't see a python's head sticking out? That's odd.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
I can't see a python's head.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
But there was a python's head up there, I saw it!

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Ugh, I can't breathe.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Now you're listening to me, zoom in.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Either you stop bothering my friends or I'll arrest you.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Is that clear? Well, is it?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.700
Yes, sir it is. but what about the zoo animals?

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.500
You heard the inspector now go away.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.500
Do you see that?

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.200
See what?

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.200
The hippopotamus.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.200
What?

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.200
The hippopotamus.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.200
He's a fellow's been hiding all our zoo animals.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.700
We got a nice cage lined up for him as well inspector.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.700
Oh so that's your plan, is it?

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.200
Ha, they want to take them all.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.200
Moomin's, Nork, Me, Mama, and Papa.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.120
Hmm, the criminal conspiracy.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.200
Conspiracy?

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.679
It would probably be called kidnapping.

00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:11.759
Once you can't kidnap a hippo?

00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:13.759
That's a movement!

00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:15.679
It could be white slavery, though.

00:15:15.679 --> 00:15:19.320
I'm sure I could add incitement to riot to the list.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.480
Now, I hate paperwork, so I'll tell you one.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.000
If you're gone within 10 minutes, I won't arrest you.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.519
Why don't you put them in the deepest dungeon, Inspector?

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:28.919
The one with all the rats and spiders and scorpions

00:15:28.919 --> 00:15:31.159
that'll teach them to put mullens and cages.

00:15:31.159 --> 00:15:32.919
That's a good idea, little mind.

00:15:32.919 --> 00:15:35.360
They like animals.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.840
I'll start counting now.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.120
One, two, three.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.559
Get around men quickly.

00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:46.000
We'll have to think quickly on this one, men.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.500
Come on now, does anybody have any smart ideas?

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.500
Come on, we're running out of time!

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.500
One minute!

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.500
Look guys, we're gonna figure something out right now!

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.500
Ready and look!

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.500
One minute, thirty seconds!

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Two minutes!

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.500
Three minutes, thirty seconds!

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.500
Look!

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.360
Leave us alone, way we're conferring.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.879
Alright, six minutes and fifty seconds.

00:16:07.879 --> 00:16:09.080
Time's up.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.240
You're cheating.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.000
The police don't cheat, and now you've got...

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.240
Nine minutes and thirty seconds.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.679
How about that?

00:16:16.679 --> 00:16:18.840
Nine minutes, fifty bucks? I give up!

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.360
Everybody beat it!

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.039
But we're still discussing it.

00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:23.879
No, we're not. We're getting out.

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:27.000
Look, everyone, the zoom in, they're running off.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Great.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
You've got to come and see this, Mama.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
No, it's $50.5 seconds.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And don't come back. We'll be the dungeon for you.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And I make that 10 minutes up to you.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
You saved his little mind.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
It was really clever of you to fetch the inspector.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Well, there were too many of them for me to fight.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Okay, everyone, keep the money out!

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Oh, oh, oh, yeah!

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And so everyone was saved,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
and eventually they all came out of the house

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
to go and have fun in the jungle again.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
As long as the warm weather lasted,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.599
there were plenty of things to do, but one day the weather changed,

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:09.799
and cold winds blew down Moomin Valley.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.400
Ugh, it feels like autumn has arrived.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.599
The jungle won't like the cold weather.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:20.200
Do you think it will die, Mama?

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.000
I'm afraid it will, little my.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.500
It grew very quickly,

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.000
so perhaps it will go the same way.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
And it did. The whole jungle with it and died in just one night.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
I think I've done a cold coming, Mama.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I'm sorry, I can't get the house any hotter.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.039
I missed the zoo, at least it was warm now. Yes, this cold is awful

00:17:47.440 --> 00:18:25.000
It would warm them up if we weren't the dead jungle Now they're happy again. But for how long? Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
It's cold again.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
It was warm in our cages.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
What are you afraid here?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Yes, free to have pneumonia.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spending the winter here.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
And so all the animals decided to return to the zoo.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spending the winter here.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
And so all the animals decided to return to the zoo.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Perhaps we'll like to come back next summer, Mrs. Snake.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
I like that when it's warmer.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Hey, look, the animals are on their way back!

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Oh, Ray! That wonderful! Oh, it's good to see you. Hey look the animals are on their way back! Alright!

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
That wonderful!

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Oh it's good to see you!

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
You don't know how much we missed you!

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Oh good!

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Gosh!

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Welcome back Rhino O'Fallets!

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
It's good to see you!

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Come on now!

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Get back to your cages quickly!

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
We've been keeping them nice and warm for you!

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Go on off your go now!

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
You look alright but I'm sure you must all be starving.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
We'll do you a special meal tonight, alright?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Ah, the hippos too!

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
For the last time, we're movements, not hippos.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
You must be cold as well. We'll warm up a cage for you. It'll be nice and cozy there.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
No. No, it just came to send the animals off.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Hey, get a cage ready for the hippos. Well, you're nice and warm.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.119
At the risk of sounding repetitive, we are movements.

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:49.720
Don't be ridiculous, you mullet here.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.319
But we're nothing like hippos.

00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:55.920
We know you're not purebred, but the public will never be able to tell.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.799
Do we have to stay here forever, Papa?

00:20:03.799 --> 00:20:08.000
Of course not, Momen. Don't worry, I'll think of something.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
You will, won't you? Have you got any ideas?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Well, not yet, but I am a writer, you know.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Don't cry, Snorth maiden. I'm sure there won't be only, hey, to eat.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.519
I don't mind as long as we're

00:20:25.519 --> 00:20:31.880
together but what if they put us in separate cages? Oh! That would be awful. They wouldn't

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:38.839
do that. Well perhaps the inspector will come looking for us. When he realizes that

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:43.400
we've gone as well as the animals he'll bring the full power of the Lord to bear on them.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.359
Oh look there's someone coming.

00:20:45.359 --> 00:20:49.359
It's Snoughkin! And Hamulun! And a little Mai! Snoughkin!

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.240
Hi, Moomin. Don't worry. We'll have you guys out in just a minute.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.640
Please come out.

00:21:04.319 --> 00:21:07.539
Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to let you out.

00:21:07.539 --> 00:21:08.779
I'm in charge of this zoo.

00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:11.299
I'm afraid it was quite an understandable mistake,

00:21:11.299 --> 00:21:13.579
but please accept this token of apology

00:21:13.579 --> 00:21:14.980
from the Board of Trustees.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.980
Here you are, madam.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.059
Mr. Hemmielin and I went to the Royal Academy of Science

00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:22.299
just to sort all this out.

00:21:22.299 --> 00:21:24.059
We've been given a letter from the President

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:26.000
stating that you are not hippos.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.079
Mr. Hamillon's scientific background helped persuade him.

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:32.000
So you can all come home now.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.599
Well, it just goes to show you must never judge

00:21:34.599 --> 00:21:36.079
by appearances alone.

00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:39.960
Mama.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.799
Yes, Papa?

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:43.720
Do you think I should grow a beard?

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:52.599
No, Papa. Do you think I should grow a beard? No, Papa.

00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:58.160
And so autumn came to Moomin Valley, a new season with different weather and different

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:12.000
pleasures. They love the laughter and they love the living the moments

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the moments

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000
They're always happy and always at play The movements are having fun day after day

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
The movements

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
The movements

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
They love the laughter and they love the living

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
The movements

00:22:42.000 --> 00:23:10.000
They're leaving and sharing and caring The moon, the moment
