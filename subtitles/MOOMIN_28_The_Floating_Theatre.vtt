woman snork maiden who had as many faces as there are mirrors in this room I don't like that look

12:44.320 --> 12:50.160

13:27.120 --> 13:34.960

13:34.960 --> 13:40.880

owner of this house no oh indeed I am not most certainly not you are greatly mistaken this

is no house you fool this is a theater as the editor yes this is a stage where the heroine

17:07.920 --> 17:13.200
receives a standing ovation at the end of the last act and the bread and the apples are props

17:13.200 --> 17:17.840
and the rumor you are playing is where the actors make themselves up to become totally different

17:17.840 --> 17:26.160

17:26.160 --> 17:34.400

18:01.040 --> 18:09.520

18:09.520 --> 18:39.520
all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we're all we

18:39.520 --> 18:41.180
oh yeah!

18:41.180 --> 18:43.380
it reminds me of NASA, but it reminds me of, it reminds me of...

18:43.380 --> 18:44.900
but it reminds me of a brainwarming scene in the sensual house

18:44.900 --> 18:46.700
and it reminds me of a brain of a brainwarming scene in the sensual house

18:46.700 --> 18:48.360
and it reminds me of a brainwarming scene

18:49.400 --> 18:50.500
and it reminds me of a brain nerd

18:50.500 --> 18:51.740
and it reminds me of a brainrü 떨어�ives

18:51.740 --> 18:52.900
And it reminds you of a Mary projections

18:54.420 --> 18:56.500
I remember this

18:56.500 --> 18:58.080
when I first saw...

18:58.080 --> 18:59.100
a cat who threw her shoes

18:59.100 --> 19:00.700
under my shoes

19:00.700 --> 19:02.700
and it reminds me of a brain [(Shortcutting their shoes by himself-)]

19:03.140 --> 19:04.260
and it reminds me of...?

19:04.260 --> 19:04.940
I remember Gabriel Peng and his brother

19:04.940 --> 19:06.040
when I first saw him

19:06.040 --> 19:07.320
when I first saw him

19:07.320 --> 19:08.900
when I first saw him

19:08.900 --> 19:12.900
That looks safe. We could easily spend the night here.

19:12.900 --> 19:18.900
We'd better tie the theatre to the tree so it won't drift away if that's all right with Emma.

19:18.900 --> 19:22.900
Emma, is it all right to tie the theatre to the tree?

19:22.900 --> 19:26.900
Do what you want, as long as you don't damage the theatre to here.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.900
All right.

19:28.900 --> 19:33.900
Don't whistle you idiot. Don't ever whistle in a theatre.

19:33.900 --> 19:37.900
That's the worst luck possible. How dare you?

19:37.900 --> 19:39.900
Oh.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.900
This is great snork maiden. We can look at the moon.

19:55.900 --> 19:59.900
And the flowers, they smell so good.

19:59.900 --> 20:01.900
What's the matter?

20:01.900 --> 20:03.900
I hope that snorks all right?

20:03.900 --> 20:08.900
Don't you worry. He was standing guard over a flying ship after all.

20:08.900 --> 20:13.900
All you have to do is get on board and fly away.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.900
What's going on here?

20:38.900 --> 20:41.900
Huh?

20:41.900 --> 20:49.900
No, they're trying to destroy the pamphor's box. I've never seen anything like it.

20:49.900 --> 20:53.900
These people are bunch of vandals.

21:03.900 --> 21:23.900
Meanwhile, movement and snork maiden are fast asleep, blissfully unaware of what was happening.

21:23.900 --> 21:27.900
But whatever they do, stranded on the treetop.

21:27.900 --> 21:37.900
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

21:37.900 --> 21:45.900
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

21:45.900 --> 21:49.900
They're always happy and goes at play.

21:49.900 --> 21:56.900
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

21:56.900 --> 22:06.900
The movements. The movements.
