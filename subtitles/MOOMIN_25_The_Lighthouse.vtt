WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.500
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with

00:20.500 --> 00:30.340
me here for you on your TV they are the moments they are the moments so come

00:30.340 --> 00:37.180
with me give me your hand I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just

00:37.180 --> 00:44.540
like a bird sing that song ever there were the moments there were the

00:44.540 --> 00:57.660
moments there were the moments there was the moments

01:14.540 --> 01:31.340
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba,

01:32.500 --> 01:35.500
All is peaceful in moving valley.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.080
Mama waters the flowers

01:40.060 --> 01:43.540
while Papa relaxes in the shade on the porch.

01:43.540 --> 01:46.540
Look, Mama, Moomin Papa is sleeping again.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.540
Hmm.

01:48.540 --> 01:50.540
You had a long nap yesterday.

01:50.540 --> 01:51.540
I think it must be the weather.

01:51.540 --> 01:53.540
It's too hot and sunny for me.

01:53.540 --> 01:55.540
I wonder if he's worried about anything.

01:55.540 --> 01:56.540
Hmm.

01:56.540 --> 01:59.540
You don't sleep if you're worried you do something about it.

02:02.540 --> 02:05.540
But Moomin Papa does have something on his mind,

02:05.540 --> 02:07.540
although it doesn't keep him awake.

02:07.540 --> 02:15.540
He's having a nice dream as well.

02:32.540 --> 02:35.540
Oh, a lighthouse.

02:35.540 --> 02:37.540
Oh, that's it.

02:37.540 --> 02:40.540
Oh, that's it, a lighthouse.

02:40.540 --> 02:42.540
What about a lighthouse, Papa?

02:42.540 --> 02:44.540
We're going to visit one.

02:44.540 --> 02:45.540
When?

02:45.540 --> 02:46.540
Right now.

02:46.540 --> 02:48.540
Well, as soon as I find one anyway.

02:48.540 --> 02:51.540
That should stop you being bored, Mama.

02:51.540 --> 02:53.540
Oh, I'm not really dear, but it would be nice.

02:53.540 --> 02:54.540
Yeah.

02:54.540 --> 02:57.540
Oh, I'm really excited.

02:57.540 --> 03:00.540
Just think I'm letting lovely water.

03:01.540 --> 03:05.540
Yeah, I'll write an exciting, epic novel of the sea.

03:05.540 --> 03:07.540
I'm sure it will be a great success.

03:07.540 --> 03:10.540
If he puts some action in it, misses out the romantic stuff.

03:21.540 --> 03:23.540
Stop it!

03:23.540 --> 03:25.540
Stop it!

03:26.540 --> 03:29.540
Tell me.

03:29.540 --> 03:33.540
Does Moomin Papa want all of you to go away to this lighthouse?

03:33.540 --> 03:34.540
Oh, yes.

03:34.540 --> 03:35.540
It'll be great fun.

03:35.540 --> 03:37.540
Just think of all the ships we'll be able to see.

03:37.540 --> 03:39.540
Yes, that will be good.

03:39.540 --> 03:42.540
Papa says he wants to write an exciting story about the sea,

03:42.540 --> 03:44.540
with ships and storms and stuff.

03:44.540 --> 03:46.540
Probably pirates too.

03:46.540 --> 03:49.540
Oh, he's stuck writing his memoirs again, is he?

03:49.540 --> 03:52.540
Well, I guess that might have something to do with it,

03:52.540 --> 03:54.540
but I think he just wants another adventure.

03:55.540 --> 03:57.540
Well, it sounds a bit odd to me, Moomin.

03:57.540 --> 03:58.540
No, it's not.

03:58.540 --> 04:01.540
We're going to live in a real lighthouse and save ships

04:01.540 --> 04:04.540
from the rocks and being wrecked in terrible storms.

04:04.540 --> 04:05.540
Oh, I see.

04:05.540 --> 04:08.540
What do you think the lighthouse keeper might say about you moving in?

04:08.540 --> 04:10.540
Oh, he won't mind at all.

04:10.540 --> 04:13.540
It'll be company for it, and I'm sure he'd like someone to talk to,

04:13.540 --> 04:16.540
looking after lighthouses a very lonely job.

04:16.540 --> 04:21.540
Ah, but if you thought Moomin, that might be exactly why he chooses to do it.

04:22.540 --> 04:26.540
You mean that he might want to be on his own all the time?

04:26.540 --> 04:28.540
Well, some people like it like that.

04:28.540 --> 04:31.540
Sometimes I like being on my own.

04:31.540 --> 04:33.540
Not for long, though.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.540
It'll be a lot of fun.

04:35.540 --> 04:38.540
Snuffkin, why don't you come with us?

04:38.540 --> 04:40.540
What to a lonely lighthouse?

04:40.540 --> 04:42.540
Yes.

04:43.540 --> 04:47.540
Oh, no, which one is it?

04:47.540 --> 04:49.540
There, that's the one.

04:49.540 --> 04:50.540
Where?

04:50.540 --> 04:53.540
So small, you can hardly see it.

04:53.540 --> 04:56.540
How long would it take us to get their Moomin, Papa?

04:56.540 --> 04:58.540
A day or two, I should say.

04:58.540 --> 04:59.540
It depending on the window.

04:59.540 --> 05:00.540
But it looks so tiny.

05:00.540 --> 05:01.540
Oh, I don't know.

05:01.540 --> 05:03.540
Well, I think so.

05:03.540 --> 05:05.540
How we know which one is which.

05:05.540 --> 05:07.540
Oh, don't you worry about that.

05:07.540 --> 05:11.540
I've got an old compass somewhere, and we've got the map,

05:11.540 --> 05:14.540
then at night we'll be able to see the light itself.

05:14.540 --> 05:15.540
Anyway, an old sailor.

05:15.540 --> 05:16.540
An old sailor?

05:16.540 --> 05:18.540
Well, I'm not really that young.

05:18.540 --> 05:20.540
And you're no sailor.

05:20.540 --> 05:21.540
Is this mutiny?

05:21.540 --> 05:24.540
Don't be stupid.

05:24.540 --> 05:26.540
How long do you think you'll want to stay, Papa?

05:26.540 --> 05:27.540
About a month.

05:27.540 --> 05:31.540
Oh, we all need to take lots and lots of food, then.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.540
Well, bless me.

05:33.540 --> 05:35.540
I think that'll be enough, Mama.

05:35.540 --> 05:37.540
Surely there'll be somebody living there already.

05:37.540 --> 05:38.540
Don't be stupid.

05:38.540 --> 05:39.540
Of course there is.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.540
A lighthouse must have a keeper.

05:41.540 --> 05:44.540
Yes, a man dedicated to the sea,

05:44.540 --> 05:46.540
suffering loneliness and hardship,

05:46.540 --> 05:49.540
countless lives with no regard for his own.

05:54.540 --> 05:55.540
Huh?

05:55.540 --> 05:56.540
Is that you, Sniff?

05:56.540 --> 05:58.540
Yes, hi, Mr. Hamilton.

05:58.540 --> 06:01.540
I thought you'd be busy packing for the trip to the lighthouse.

06:01.540 --> 06:04.540
No, well, I'm not going with them this time.

06:04.540 --> 06:06.540
I've decided to stay here.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.540
Oh, dear me, really?

06:08.540 --> 06:09.540
Sniffkin said he was going.

06:09.540 --> 06:11.540
Well, I have something very important to do.

06:11.540 --> 06:12.540
Important?

06:12.540 --> 06:14.540
Sniff is just a big whip, that's all.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.540
Oh, shut up, little mind.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.540
Ah, don't tell me to shut up.

06:18.540 --> 06:20.540
I don't listen to whims.

06:20.540 --> 06:23.540
Hmm, now, now children, no squabbling.

06:23.540 --> 06:25.540
It wouldn't be fair to the others.

06:25.540 --> 06:26.540
I'm not a very good swimmer.

06:26.540 --> 06:28.540
You mean if you fell and then we're drowning,

06:28.540 --> 06:30.540
we'd have to jump in and save you.

06:30.540 --> 06:31.540
Don't fall in, then.

06:31.540 --> 06:33.540
Anyway, you can hang on to an or something.

06:33.540 --> 06:35.540
What if it got swept away?

06:35.540 --> 06:37.540
We'll put a life jacket on you stupid.

06:37.540 --> 06:38.540
Don't worry.

06:38.540 --> 06:39.540
What about the sharks?

06:39.540 --> 06:41.540
They might take a fancy to me.

06:41.540 --> 06:42.540
Wait a minute.

06:42.540 --> 06:45.540
I've not as aologist, but I don't think there are any sharks around here.

06:45.540 --> 06:47.540
I'm sure I would have heard if there were.

06:53.540 --> 06:56.540
Well, it's a real fine day for sailing.

06:56.540 --> 06:58.540
We're a mama and the others.

06:59.540 --> 07:01.540
Don't worry, Mum. There's no hurry.

07:01.540 --> 07:04.540
Are you sure that isn't too heavy for you, Sniff?

07:04.540 --> 07:06.540
No, not at all, mama.

07:06.540 --> 07:08.540
It's a shame that you're not coming with us,

07:08.540 --> 07:10.540
but if you've got something important to do, you must do it.

07:10.540 --> 07:12.540
It won't be the same without you, though.

07:12.540 --> 07:14.540
We'll miss you, Sniff.

07:14.540 --> 07:15.540
Thank you.

07:15.540 --> 07:17.540
Oh, dear, I left a jar of strawberry jam

07:17.540 --> 07:20.540
and a whole batch of pancakes on the kitchen table.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.540
Do you think you could manage to eat them?

07:22.540 --> 07:23.540
Leave it to me.

07:23.540 --> 07:26.540
Hi, y'all be lucky if there's any food left in the lard or mama.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.540
He's a my.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.540
Off we go, then.

07:30.540 --> 07:32.540
Ike is away.

07:32.540 --> 07:34.540
You won't have to road too hard.

07:34.540 --> 07:36.540
The wind will pick us up soon.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.540
Goodbye, I have a good time, everyone.

07:40.540 --> 07:42.540
Goodbye, Sniff.

07:42.540 --> 07:45.540
Now, don't forget to shut all the windows if it rains.

07:45.540 --> 07:46.540
Will you?

07:46.540 --> 07:47.540
No.

07:51.540 --> 07:53.540
I'm on it.

08:00.540 --> 08:02.540
Hey! Wait for me.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.540
I want to have a good time too.

08:05.540 --> 08:07.540
It's my way.

08:07.540 --> 08:08.540
Huh?

08:11.540 --> 08:13.540
Look, Sniff is still waving.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.540
He's a sweet boy.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.540
Let's keep waving, Moon.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.540
Tell her we're out of sight.

08:20.540 --> 08:21.540
Bye, Sniff.

08:21.540 --> 08:22.540
Bye, bye.

08:22.540 --> 08:23.540
Bye.

08:23.540 --> 08:24.540
Bye.

08:25.540 --> 08:27.540
No, I'm not waving good bye.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.540
I want to go too.

08:29.540 --> 08:31.540
Don't eat on the road, Mary Tabo.

08:31.540 --> 08:32.540
We're gone.

08:32.540 --> 08:34.540
It's no good shouting, little my.

08:34.540 --> 08:35.540
He can't hear you.

08:35.540 --> 08:38.540
He's giving us a great send-off, though.

08:38.540 --> 08:40.540
For Sniff, he should have come with us.

08:45.540 --> 08:48.540
Nancy, I'm going off and leaving me here on my own.

08:49.540 --> 08:50.540
Sniff.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.540
Sniff can, if you wouldn't mind,

09:01.540 --> 09:04.540
I think we need some music to send us on our way.

09:04.540 --> 09:05.540
What do you say?

09:19.540 --> 09:20.540
Sniff.

09:28.540 --> 09:32.540
Are you sure we're on the right course with the island, Papa?

09:32.540 --> 09:36.540
Yes, the winds with us and the sails are fine.

09:36.540 --> 09:40.540
I bet if we keep this speed up, we'll be there by tomorrow.

09:41.540 --> 09:45.540
Well, if the wind stays like this, you could be right.

09:48.540 --> 09:51.540
The wind's not dying down at all.

09:51.540 --> 09:54.540
I'm surprised. I never thought we'd keep up this speed.

09:54.540 --> 09:56.540
Now, make sure you're allergic to them.

09:56.540 --> 09:58.540
Of course we will be, Papa.

09:58.540 --> 10:01.540
If we carry on like this, perhaps we'll see the light from the lighthouse

10:01.540 --> 10:02.540
while it's still dark.

10:02.540 --> 10:04.540
Well, we don't want to hit anything at this speed.

10:04.540 --> 10:06.540
Don't worry. We're watching.

10:06.540 --> 10:07.540
We're watching.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.540
We're watching.

10:08.540 --> 10:09.540
We're watching.

10:09.540 --> 10:10.540
We're watching.

10:10.540 --> 10:11.540
We're watching.

10:11.540 --> 10:12.540
We're watching.

10:12.540 --> 10:13.540
We're watching.

10:13.540 --> 10:14.540
We're watching.

10:14.540 --> 10:15.540
We're watching.

10:15.540 --> 10:16.540
We're watching.

10:16.540 --> 10:18.540
Don't worry. We're watching.

10:18.540 --> 10:20.540
Ah, this is the life.

10:26.540 --> 10:28.540
Papa, the wind's dropped.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.540
Well, that's strange.

10:30.540 --> 10:32.540
It shouldn't happen that quickly.

10:33.540 --> 10:35.540
Do you want us to start rowing, Moomin, Papa?

10:35.540 --> 10:39.540
No, Snuffkin. I think we'd all better get some sleep.

10:42.540 --> 10:45.540
Stupid wind. I really wanted to see the lighthouse at night.

10:46.540 --> 10:48.540
It's getting foggy too.

10:48.540 --> 10:50.540
I can't even see the stars anymore.

10:50.540 --> 10:53.540
Right, Snuffkin. Wake me in two hours, and I'll take over.

10:53.540 --> 10:55.540
Okay, Moomin, Papa.

11:10.540 --> 11:12.540
What's the matter, Little My?

11:13.540 --> 11:15.540
I thought I heard something.

11:15.540 --> 11:16.540
Oh.

11:16.540 --> 11:19.540
It's coming from over there somewhere.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.540
Can you see anything?

11:22.540 --> 11:25.540
No, but I can hear it.

11:27.540 --> 11:30.540
It's so good I, and it's getting closer.

11:37.540 --> 11:38.540
Little.

11:38.540 --> 11:40.540
Moomin, Papa. Get up, Moomin.

11:40.540 --> 11:43.540
Stop it, Little My. What's the matter with you?

11:43.540 --> 11:46.540
You too, Moomin, quickly, before it's too late.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.540
What's the matter, Little My?

11:48.540 --> 11:52.540
I can hear her ship. I can't see it, but it's very close, and getting closer.

11:52.540 --> 11:54.540
A ship? Where?

11:54.540 --> 11:56.540
Over there, and she's bearing down on us.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.540
Quickly, we don't have much time.

12:01.540 --> 12:03.540
Yes, by the boobalier right.

12:03.540 --> 12:05.540
We must let them know we're here, a signal.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.540
Right? All hands on deck.

12:07.540 --> 12:10.540
Maybe if we all shout as loud as we can.

12:11.540 --> 12:12.540
Look.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.540
Too late for shouting.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.540
It's huge.

12:24.540 --> 12:27.540
Look out, it's gonna hit us.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.540
I think Moomin's right. What can we do?

12:30.540 --> 12:34.540
It's too late for anything. Just brace ourselves and be ready to swim for it.

12:38.540 --> 12:39.540
Huh?

12:39.540 --> 12:41.540
Quick, get down, Little My.

12:52.540 --> 12:54.540
I don't believe it.

12:54.540 --> 12:55.540
Little My.

12:59.540 --> 13:00.540
Huh?

13:01.540 --> 13:03.540
That's hard. The ship didn't hit us.

13:03.540 --> 13:04.540
Oh, yes, he did.

13:04.540 --> 13:05.540
What?

13:05.540 --> 13:08.540
It went straight into our rudder when nothing happened.

13:08.540 --> 13:10.540
It went right through us.

13:10.540 --> 13:14.540
Right through us. That's impossible she couldn't have.

13:14.540 --> 13:17.540
I wonder if there was anyone on board that ship.

13:17.540 --> 13:19.540
I can't see any lights.

13:19.540 --> 13:22.540
I know, Snuffkin. I think it's a ghost ship.

13:22.540 --> 13:23.540
A ghost ship?

13:23.540 --> 13:26.540
Well, there's no wash and no damage to us.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.540
It's the only explanation. I think she's right.

13:28.540 --> 13:31.540
A ghost ship. We've actually seen one.

13:36.540 --> 13:41.540
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I need to sit down. All this excitement's too much.

13:41.540 --> 13:46.540
Papa, don't they say that if you see a ghost ship, something terrible is gonna happen to you?

13:46.540 --> 13:50.540
What happened in the first place to make it become a ghost ship? That's what I wanna know.

13:50.540 --> 13:57.540
Well, that's just some old sailor's tail, Moomin. If it had been a real ship, we'd probably be sinking now.

13:57.540 --> 13:59.540
Don't you think so, Snuffkin?

13:59.540 --> 14:02.540
Yeah, I suppose that's one way of looking at it.

14:03.540 --> 14:06.540
Come on, cheer up you guys. At least it was fun.

14:13.540 --> 14:16.540
What's the matter? Has something happened? What are you laughing at?

14:16.540 --> 14:20.540
It's so funny. Are you going to tell us?

14:20.540 --> 14:23.540
Why didn't you wake me up, Moomin?

14:25.540 --> 14:28.540
Well, I think it would be very rude.

14:29.540 --> 14:33.540
Oh, what a beautiful sky. Just look at it.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.540
Oh, the fog is lifting.

14:37.540 --> 14:39.540
Oh, I said, don't stop.

15:00.540 --> 15:03.540
Another beautiful day, not a ghost ship in sight.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.540
The lighthouse.

15:11.540 --> 15:16.540
Hey, wake up everybody. The lighthouse. I can see the lighthouse. We're there.

15:18.540 --> 15:21.540
Oh, the sun shining. We must have slept for hours.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.540
Oh, there it is.

15:24.540 --> 15:29.540
This is ridiculous. We've been next to it all night. We could have gone and slept there.

15:29.540 --> 15:31.540
I can't wait to go ashore.

15:31.540 --> 15:35.540
All right, everyone. Jump to it. Manly old.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.540
There's something strange going on here.

15:42.540 --> 15:43.540
What is it, Snuffkin?

15:43.540 --> 15:47.540
I'm not sure. Moomin Papa. Our boat didn't move at all last night. Did it?

15:47.540 --> 15:50.540
No, it doesn't seem to have moved at all.

15:50.540 --> 15:54.540
So why couldn't we see the light from the lighthouse, even when the fog cleared?

15:54.540 --> 15:56.540
I can't work it out.

15:56.540 --> 16:00.540
Yes, you're right, Snuffkin. It seems very odd. We should have seen it.

16:01.540 --> 16:05.540
Well, perhaps the lighthouse keeper forgot to put it on, Moomin Papa.

16:05.540 --> 16:09.540
I don't think so, little Mai. You can't forget a thing like that.

16:09.540 --> 16:11.540
I suppose it could be broken.

16:11.540 --> 16:18.540
There could be lots of reasons for it. Why don't we hurry up and get ashore, and then we can ask the keeper.

16:22.540 --> 16:24.540
Look, there's someone in a boat.

16:24.540 --> 16:26.540
Hmm.

16:26.540 --> 16:28.540
It looks like he's fishing.

16:29.540 --> 16:33.540
He knows about the lighthouse. He probably lives on the island.

16:33.540 --> 16:36.540
Let's get closer. Easy now.

16:44.540 --> 16:46.540
Hi there, good morning.

16:49.540 --> 16:50.540
Any luck?

16:52.540 --> 16:54.540
Not yet, but it's still early.

16:55.540 --> 16:59.540
Hmm, yes, quite. I'll ask him straight out.

16:59.540 --> 17:03.540
Do you know if the lighthouse was working last night?

17:03.540 --> 17:07.540
I don't know. Sorry, I didn't catch that.

17:09.540 --> 17:12.540
He said, no, it wasn't.

17:12.540 --> 17:14.540
What did I tell you? He forgot to light it.

17:14.540 --> 17:20.540
Oh, it wasn't only last night. You'll never see a light in that lighthouse, not even on stormy nights.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.540
Never. So what does the keeper do then?

17:24.540 --> 17:27.540
Nothing. There isn't a lighthouse keeper.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.540
Why?

17:29.540 --> 17:34.540
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't know. All I can say is I haven't seen one.

17:34.540 --> 17:36.540
Do you live on the island?

17:36.540 --> 17:42.540
Hey, mister. You're asking too many questions. Who are you?

17:42.540 --> 17:46.540
I'm Moment Papa from Moment Valley, and this is my family.

17:46.540 --> 17:49.540
We've come a long way in order to do some important work here.

17:49.540 --> 17:53.540
No work on this island. No, you better go back home.

17:53.540 --> 17:58.540
You see, I've come here to research an epic novel about the sea.

17:58.540 --> 18:02.540
Just turn around and go back. You're too far from home.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.540
Oh, please, wait!

18:04.540 --> 18:08.540
Shh, dear. Don't shout. We mustn't scare the fish away.

18:08.540 --> 18:12.540
Let's go ashore and have some breakfast. I expect we're all hungry.

18:20.540 --> 18:24.540
Bonnie, pair. The old ones lost his marbles.

18:43.540 --> 18:47.540
Look, Moment Papa. There's a path there leading to the lighthouse.

18:48.540 --> 18:51.540
We'll leave this stuff here and we'll go and explore it first.

18:51.540 --> 18:54.540
Right. To the lighthouse, everyone. Up.

18:54.540 --> 18:55.540
Oh!

18:55.540 --> 18:57.540
Come on!

18:59.540 --> 19:03.540
What's wrong? Why do you always get so upset when somebody mentions the lighthouse?

19:03.540 --> 19:07.540
It's not your call, sir. Business boy doesn't concern you at all.

19:07.540 --> 19:11.540
You were like that when I asked you about it before. Maybe if you were to tell me,

19:11.540 --> 19:14.540
I might be able to understand. I could try anyway.

19:15.540 --> 19:19.540
Either talk about something else or keep quiet. Do you understand that?

19:34.540 --> 19:37.540
It's so very rocky. I don't think it would work. What?

19:37.540 --> 19:39.540
A garden.

19:45.540 --> 19:52.540
Hello there. Is there anybody at home?

19:52.540 --> 19:57.540
There's nobody here. That boy was right. It's been empty for ages, I think.

20:00.540 --> 20:05.540
Oh, the door was left unlocked. I know we do it, but most people don't.

20:05.540 --> 20:10.540
Something terrible's happened. Something terrible. Please, little my. You know I hate things like that.

20:10.540 --> 20:15.540
Don't worry, snorke may done. Little my is just trying to scare you.

20:15.540 --> 20:18.540
I don't like hearing about anything horrible.

20:18.540 --> 20:23.540
Flag your ears and snorke made, because I haven't finished yet, and the next bit's really horrible.

20:23.540 --> 20:26.540
Oh, well, where have you been finished there?

20:26.540 --> 20:32.540
Well, the lighthouse keeper is still up there. He got scurvy and had to be able to move for months.

20:32.540 --> 20:36.540
And nobody's heard his cries for help, and with no food, he's almost a skeleton.

20:36.540 --> 20:41.540
If he isn't dead already, he'll be at the top of the stairs, crawling towards his fingers,

20:41.540 --> 20:45.540
lading and ripped up ribbons and flowers, mouth, garbage, that was tearless mouth.

20:45.540 --> 20:46.540
Shut up, little my.

20:46.540 --> 20:49.540
Reminds right, that's enough.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.540
It's a good imagination, though.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.540
I'll let you use it in your book, if you like.

20:53.540 --> 20:56.540
Oh, come on. Tell me what did she say, Moonman?

20:56.540 --> 20:58.540
Oh, nothing, really. Nothing at all.

20:58.540 --> 21:02.540
Tell me, Moonman, but leave out the bits I wouldn't like.

21:02.540 --> 21:05.540
Where are you going, Papa?

21:05.540 --> 21:07.540
Well, listen, everyone.

21:07.540 --> 21:10.540
First, I'm going to get the lamp working.

21:10.540 --> 21:13.540
Then we'll give the place a good clean, and then we'll move in.

21:13.540 --> 21:18.540
We'll be the new lighthouse keepers, and once again, the seas around this island

21:18.540 --> 21:21.540
will be safe for ships to navigate in troubled water.

21:21.540 --> 21:22.540
Good old Papa!

21:22.540 --> 21:23.540
Great!

21:23.540 --> 21:24.540
Careful, everyone.

21:24.540 --> 21:26.540
Take anything, that's dangerous.

21:32.540 --> 21:33.540
Oh!

21:33.540 --> 21:34.540
Oh!

21:43.540 --> 21:46.540
Will Moonman Papa be able to get the light working again?

21:46.540 --> 21:48.540
Where is the lighthouse keeper?

21:48.540 --> 21:51.540
And what could have made him go without locking the door,

21:51.540 --> 21:56.540
leaving the ships in peril and the seas with no one to guide them away from the rocks?

21:58.540 --> 22:01.540
And who is the mysterious fisherman?

22:04.540 --> 22:10.540
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moonman's

22:10.540 --> 22:18.540
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moonman's

22:18.540 --> 22:22.540
They're always happy and always at play

22:22.540 --> 22:29.540
The Moonman's are having fun day after day, the Moonman's

22:29.540 --> 22:39.540
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moonman's

22:39.540 --> 22:47.540
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moonman's

22:47.540 --> 22:51.540
They're always happy and always at play

22:51.540 --> 22:58.540
The Moonman's are having fun day after day, the Moonman's

22:58.540 --> 23:08.540
The Moonman's
