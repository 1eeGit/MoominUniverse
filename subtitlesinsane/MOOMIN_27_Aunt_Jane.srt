1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come. Come on and sit down here with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:47,000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird, there was a moment

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There was a moment, there was a moment

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
There was a moment Oh, my God.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Mom.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Everything's so boring. Let's go something, then.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Like what, your instance. I think we've done everything one could possibly do.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
None of you three can think of a single thing to do. You're useless, aren't you?

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,900
Well, can you think of anything

10
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,900
except catching grasshoppers?

11
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,700
Hmm, there must be something we can do.

12
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,500
Now, we've all had times like this, haven't we?

13
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Fortunately, right then, the mailman arrived.

14
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Hello, a letter for you.

15
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,700
Oh, a letter! That must be from my sister for me!

16
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, no, it's from Oomoppa this time.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's so. Who would write to him?

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
A woman? Someone called Jane?

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What? See that he gets it now.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Who could this Jane possibly be?

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's your father's old girlfriend, of course.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Never. Oh, I'm sure he had dozens and dozens.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,760
Oomoppa was very kind and handsome young man.

24
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,400
A voice from the past.

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,680
Moomin' Papa, liquid, I've got for you.

26
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,039
Moomin' Papa.

27
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,560
Oh, no.

28
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,400
I was right.

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,240
Yes, you were.

30
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,759
Moomin' Mama, I think you should go back to the kitchen.

31
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,000
Whatever for a little bit. Because Moomin' Papa's stormy youth is catching up with him.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Please, Papa, tell us it's not that kind of letter.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, what do you have?

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, what a hurry.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Whatever it was, it was a long time ago, long before I ever met you.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No, it's not that kind of letter.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,599
What sort of letter is it then? Oh, much worse it's from Aunt Jane. Who's that?

38
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,879
Mine, my dear, is on my father's side. Oh, how boring. You look very pale suddenly, dear.

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,400
Yes, because she's coming for a visit tomorrow. Oh, don't worry. There's plenty of time

40
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,599
for arranging a welcome party.

41
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,599
But I don't like her, and I don't want it to come for a visit.

42
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,199
Lumen, Papa, why not?

43
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,000
Well, you'll soon see. She's very rich.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,599
Very rich?

45
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,400
Yes, and she bosses everyone.

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
We won't have a moment of peace.

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,199
Oh, maybe she's so rich.

48
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,680
She'll give us all wonderful presents.

49
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,639
Goodness, this is so unexpected. Why is she coming here all of a sudden?

50
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,879
Oh, she says she wants to discuss money matters. Good heavens with me. She says there's no one else.

51
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,199
So you see, I'm in a very difficult situation. Oh, why can't you tell if you're not an expert.

52
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,000
You don't tell Aunt Jane things.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
She tells you when that's that.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Is that what explained?

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
When you meet her, you'll know exactly what I mean.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What do I know about money matters?

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Nothing.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Not surprising since we've never had any.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
How can she expect a poor creature like you to know anything about money?

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Also, she's very, very suspicious.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And she says money is a terrible burden.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, I wouldn't mind children her burden.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Maybe you'll inherit it,

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and then we could share the money

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and have a wonderful time together.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Eh?

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Help! This time I almost did it. We love it brother, we love it!

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So moving Papa has a rich aunt. Very interesting. Yes, she's got so much money she doesn't know what to do with it all.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh!

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So snorke, why don't you ask her to invest in your flying ship?

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,560
You'll need money to rebuild, won't you? It would be a great investment for her.

72
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,839
It certainly would be. I'm sure she jump at it.

73
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:39,800
Hmm. There'd be no harm in asking, I guess. What's the matter, Mr. Hemiellen? You look so unhappy.

74
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,879
I'm stuck, that's my problem.

75
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,639
How's that?

76
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,480
Stuck in my research.

77
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,560
This magnifying glass is very good, of course.

78
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,240
But I just can't get any further

79
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,480
with my botanical research with this old-fashioned equipment.

80
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,120
What I really need is a microscope and a laboratory.

81
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,639
And they're expensive, I guess.

82
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,680
Yes, they are, and I don't have any money.

83
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,000
Well, moment Papa's aunt is coming over tomorrow,

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and I know she's got any amount of money.

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Any amount, now?

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll get her to finance you, Hamilton,

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and we'll get a big greenhouse,

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and you'll grow orchids and roses and other things,

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and then we'll sell them, oh, oh, I'll get rich.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You too! Rich, are you two? Hey, you over there. Hmm? Are you talking to me? Of course I am. Who else?

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I said you know the way to move in a house young man.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes, she might say I do.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Show me where it is then.

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Over there, it's tall and blue.

95
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Just follow that stream and you can't miss it.

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,959
Good. Would you be kind enough to take my suit? I'm not sure. I do. Show me where it is, then. Over there, it's tall and blue. Just follow that stream, and you can't miss it.

97
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,459
Good.

98
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,079
Would you be kind enough to take my suitcase?

99
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,160
I'm sorry, I can't.

100
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,399
I'm too busy.

101
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,399
I'll reward you handsomely for your efforts.

102
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,160
Think again, young man.

103
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,199
But all I want to do is fish.

104
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,920
What?

105
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,439
You don't want money?

106
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,000
I heard you were coming to visit more than probably. You're in Jane, aren't you? You don't want money?

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I heard you were coming to visit Moment Papa here in Jane, aren't you? Ooh, ow.

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Please, to meet you, I'm here to take you to Moment House.

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Is this your suitcase?

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Wow!

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This suitcase is very heavy!

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Should be. It's full of golden coins. Huh?

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll take care of this.

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's go, eh?

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Kate!

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I can't stay in this house.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't think I can take Aunt Jane.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm going to hide out in the cave until she's gone.

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm going to hide out in the cave.

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,600
I'm going to hide out in the cave. I'm going to hide out in the cave. I'm going to hide out take Aunt Jane. I'm going to hide out in the cave until she's gone.

121
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,240
Bye, bye, Linda here.

122
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,319
Careful, now Aunt Jane.

123
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,839
The banks have been slippery here and there.

124
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:45,000
Uh, uh, what? Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! She's very small for a daughter. Oh, little Mai isn't ours. She just lives here.

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And I won't get any bigger, either.

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Hmm.

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
She's like a member of the family.

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And where's my worthless nephew? Why isn't he here?

129
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, well, he's not at home.

130
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, no. When will he be back?

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't know.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,139
He's away looking for inspiration for his work. So he won't home? Well, no. When will he be back?

133
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:06,100
I don't know.

134
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,620
He's away looking for inspiration for his work,

135
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,259
so he won't be back for a while.

136
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,899
Since when has he worked?

137
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,379
I'm here to see him.

138
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:15,419
Maybe you can see me instead.

139
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,019
What a splendid idea.

140
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,860
How clever of you, Mument.

141
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,740
Ridiculous.

142
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,179
He knows nothing about money.

143
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:24,019
In that case, it is high time he learned.

144
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:25,919
As for his father, I may still

145
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:33,200
disinherit him. I'm a member of his family too. I could talk to you about money matters. Really?

146
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, sniff is a great friend of mine. But hardly a member of the family. Hello, Moon. And you must be on Jane.

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I brought my brother to snorke with me.

148
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He wanted to meet you.

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is a Jane Be nice to her.

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Welcome to Moon in Valley and Jane.

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is my lovely sister, Snorke Maiden,

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
who is Moon in special friend.

153
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,500
The Snorkes and the Moon movements may one day be related,

154
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
so in a way we're all really family.

155
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,500
You, baby, but not to me.

156
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm an inventor, and due to an accident,

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,500
I'm looking around for a sponsor.

158
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,000
A golden opportunity for anyone with some loose capital.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,500
Welcome to Woman Valley and Chain.

160
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,399
I'm Hemmielin, a botanist of note.

161
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,399
I heard that you might be willing to fund my scientific research and Chain.

162
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,000
A bold and opportunity for anyone with some spare money.

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,500
Eh?

164
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
You'd like me to fund your research?

165
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
It was my idea.

166
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,500
If we built a greenhouse and grow rare orchids and roses, we can make a lot of money.

167
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,080
You'll make a lot of money. Young man, can make a lot of money. And you'll make a lot of money.

168
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,679
Young man, I have a lot of money already.

169
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,320
Oh, hasn't Sniff discussed this with you, ma'am?

170
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Sniff.

171
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,679
Well, I was just getting around to it, Hamulun.

172
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,720
Confusing.

173
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,519
When I am famous for my botanical research, Angie, I...

174
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,320
I doubt it.

175
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
That will ever happen.

176
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,360
This is very confusing indeed for me.

177
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,000
Now, you're Snorkmaid and a friend of Movin' is that right?

178
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh, no, I'm the snorkemaid's brother.

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm a friend of Movin' Ad-Jane.

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Did you really explain about my important research, Sniff?

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Did you really explain that I'm a member of the family?

182
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Hey, she got it!

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So, and, Jane, it would be great if you were a member to make your way to Movin' Ad-Jane! We need your help! We need your help!

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Here's your rule, Vaget.

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I do hope you'll be comfortable here. Just call if you need anything. Come out.

186
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Here's your suitcase. It was very heavy.

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Thank you.

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Him. What is it? You want a reward? Very heavy. Thank you. And him.

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What is it?

190
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You want a reward?

191
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
No, no, Aunt Jane.

192
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I mean, yes, I do, but...

193
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Which is it? Will you make up your mind, young man?

194
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I know where a moment Papa is right now.

195
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He's a whale on a trip, I know.

196
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,559
No, no. He's somewhere quite near. Quite near, here.

197
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,159
Well, where is he?

198
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,879
Moment Papa said not to tell you where he's hiding.

199
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:33,919
It's a secret.

200
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,919
A secret?

201
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:35,879
Yes.

202
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:38,799
I suppose I can tell you, but he'll be very angry.

203
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,639
Where is he?

204
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,679
Tell me now.

205
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh, well, if I tell you I'm taking a big risk. Hmm. Oh, very well. How much do you want?

206
00:12:47,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll leave that to you. I'm not sure if I can get it. I'm not sure if I can get it. I'm not sure if I can get it.

207
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

208
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

209
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

210
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

211
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

212
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

213
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

214
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

215
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm not sure if I can get it.

216
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm not sure if I can get it. I'm not sure if I can get it. Oh, is that all? Until I've seen him for myself with my own eyes, yes!

217
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Huh?

218
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What?

219
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh, there's nobody here.

220
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Where is my worthless nephew?

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This is very strange.

222
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You tricked me, haven't you?

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Well, no, I swear I would never do that.

224
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You certainly deserve no reward.

225
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But no, wait!

226
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
If we just look around, we'll find him.

227
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He's in here somewhere I know it!

228
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Hey, moment Papa, what is it? Tell me where my nephew is hiding.

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Well, as I said before, I want to know the truth.

230
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Dear, he's...

231
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Now let me see...

232
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Come on, hurry up.

233
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
He's hiding in the cave down by the beach.

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I've just been there, Mom and Mama, and I can't find him.

235
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Then he really must have gone away on a trip.

236
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,399
I'm not going to I can't find him.

237
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,799
Then he really must have gone away on a trip.

238
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,399
And why should he want to hide from me anyway?

239
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,600
I think he might be a little bit afraid of you.

240
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,000
Afraid of me?

241
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,799
Afraid of his own aunt?

242
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,600
But why?

243
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Mostly he's afraid of money matters.

244
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,799
Incredible.

245
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,440
Afraid of me because of money matters?

246
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,480
He must be utterly mad.

247
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
What a family.

248
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,639
I don't understand.

249
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,360
It seems that only Smith knows anything about money.

250
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,759
I know where Moomin' Poppy is right now.

251
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,799
So you want some of my gold, who do you young lady?

252
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:08,600
I couldn't care less about your silly gold.

253
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
My silly gold indeed.

254
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,200
With silly gold, I assure you you can do just anything you want.

255
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,600
Seems to me, your silly gold doesn't even help you to find Moomin' Poppy.

256
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Hmm?

257
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,799
I think you should forget about your money.

258
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,799
Young lady, money isn't something you can just forget about.

259
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,840
It needs constant looking after.

260
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,440
That's why I must talk to Moom and Papa at once.

261
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,879
Now take me to that rascal nephew of mine.

262
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:45,000
If you really know where he is. Do you have me? Of course. Oh, wow, frivolous. Not really.

263
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too.

264
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh, well, Frederick and I were frivolous once.

265
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Really?

266
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If you say so, I suppose I have to believe you.

267
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Huh?

269
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Huh? Really? If you say so, I suppose I have to believe you.

270
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

271
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Huh?

272
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Look!

273
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What?

274
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Little May and Anne Jane walking together.

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What are they doing?

276
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Little May is plotting something.

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Really?

278
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,899
No, man!

279
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,399
Sniff's all right, really. But sometimes he just can't withstand the lure of gold.

280
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,399
Check me!

281
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,399
No!

282
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,899
Wait, it can't be right!

283
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,200
Let's go back then.

284
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Hmm, hmm.

285
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,460
Fine, just take your time. Hi, guys! Little mind! You can't be right. Let's go back then. Mm-hmm. Fine.

286
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,799
Just take your time.

287
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,100
Hi, guys.

288
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,039
Little Mai.

289
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,080
What's the matter?

290
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,279
We have a guest.

291
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,039
A guest.

292
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,080
Movement, papa.

293
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,399
What?

294
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,039
Movement, papa.

295
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So this is where you've been hiding. Oh, you just wait.

296
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, you shoot.

297
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm a single man.

298
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Wait a minute.

299
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
No, you wait first.

300
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Wait, please.

301
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Moomin Papa was sort of on his way back from a trip and then stopped by to play chess with me. Oh! Wait, please.

302
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Mumin' Papa was sort of on his way back from a trip

303
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and then stopped by to play chess with me.

304
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yes, exactly.

305
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No, yes.

306
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Mumin' Mama told her the truth.

307
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Oh, I sort of stopped by.

308
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Why are you so afraid of me, young man?

309
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Well, I'm not really.

310
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I mean, it's not you.

311
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,740
It's your money. I'm afraid of it. Really scared. Scared of my money? Well, I'm not, not really. I mean, it's not you. It's your money. I'm afraid of it really scares me.

312
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,240
Scared of my money?

313
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:48,579
Well, I'm...

314
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,220
It's perfectly good money at all in gold coins.

315
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,779
Listen, nephew, I'm depending on you as my only relative.

316
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:59,119
Yes, yes, please depend.

317
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,059
When I get too old to do it, you must look after my gold for me. I'm relying on you.

318
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:08,000
No, that's not possible. I know, Anne Jane. We can give it all away.

319
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Must be those who'd love to have it. Must be those who need it more than we do.

320
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh, a green pearl!

321
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Grrrr!

322
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
She's crazy. Don't worry, we'll think of something.

323
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh, you would throw my money away without a cut.

324
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Why didn't mean to hurt you, Aunt Jane?

325
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I know, let's put it all in the bank.

326
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Money likes being in a bank.

327
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
My money would hate being in a back of a terrible idea.

328
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh no.

329
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm not going to be a good man.

330
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,440
I'm not going to of a terrible idea. Oh, no banks are so nice nowadays

331
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,119
They are of course they have flowers and shiny piggy banks and pretty paintings on the wall

332
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,359
Is that really true?

333
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Right come on everybody.

334
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Let's hurry home and fix a welcoming party for At Jane.

335
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
A party!

336
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes, any reason is good enough.

337
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
This was Grandma's best cake recipe. Welcome at Jane. Let's drink a toast to the only millionaire in our small circle.

338
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Nayshy live a long and healthy life. Cheers! Cheers!

339
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Cheers!

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Cheers!

341
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Now, this is your welcoming party at Jane. What's the matter?

342
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Never in my life of I and my money felt ourselves as welcome before.

343
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm so happy I could cry.

344
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, and once you start crying, you just want to go on.

345
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Not again.

346
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Please don't be unhappy, Jane.

347
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Don't cry.

348
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Dear, oh dear, moment papa.

349
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Moment papa.

350
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yes, Aunt Jane, what is it?

351
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'll put some of my gold in a bag,

352
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
but you must look after the rest when I'm too old.

353
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Oh, hmm.

354
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And why not?

355
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
All right.

356
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,119
We'll keep it in the cellar and make a nice little niche

357
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,279
for it with seashells and moss.

358
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:30,759
And I'll have someone go down and look at it every week.

359
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,000
Don't you worry, Anjane.

360
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,839
Your money will be in safe hands.

361
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,920
Not quite, but I had in mind.

362
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,119
I know.

363
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,079
But I suppose it can't be helped.

364
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,319
It sounds rather nice, a cozy little niche down in the cellar.

365
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,960
And if you take a look every week, but oh dear, it will miss me.

366
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,279
Oh, and shame.

367
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,000
Very well. I have made up my mind.

368
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,880
I'm leaving this sickest with you now.

369
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,759
So you and my goal can get certain used to each other.

370
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,119
Do what you want with it.

371
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,000
Your friends seem to have ideas about how to spend it,

372
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,039
flying ships and botanical research

373
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,359
sound rather splendid.

374
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,359
Oh, boy!

375
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,359
Wonderful!

376
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,359
I'm so happy for you.

377
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:22,480
Darn, I should have let us up better than flowers.

378
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,000
So ended the visit of the dreaded Aunt Jane.

379
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And I'm sure Sniff will be able to think of some other use for the call.

380
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:39,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

381
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,000
We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

382
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
They're always happy and always at play

383
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The moments are having fun day after day, the movements

384
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The movements, the movements The most
