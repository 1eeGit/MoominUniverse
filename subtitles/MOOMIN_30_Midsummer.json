theater presents written by moment papa moment papa the last children of moment Valley starring moment papa moment mama and sniff and introducing Emma Emma I'm sure that's my ad she works in a theater admission fee anything edible they're putting on a play so they can't be lost I haven't seen a play since I was a kid it was wonderful the best play ever all about a princess she fell asleep in a rose bush she was so lovely I've got to see that one again but who will guard my prisoners I wonder I'm a good idea officer you could take the three of us with you to the theater to see the play good idea we love the theater so we won't try to run away officer I promise not possible I won't let you out of this jail until you write out it's forbidden to burn signs five thousand times each that's the punishment for vandals well in that case you won't be able to see the play who cares although yes I must see it I must go so you'll take us with you no you stay right here well then you can't go either officer right you're upsetting me no no this isn't good enough it's not true drama please woman papa I don't want to be just a lion's ugly behind but sniff I did give you another part I don't want to be a baby either and she said you wanted parts with that lines it could you do the dusting a bit later Emma please he's script should be ready now we have to start practicing for the opening night tomorrow morning don't worry Emma it's coming along I'm only half done I shall never get ready in time moment mama you're right to worry for the curtain will rise tomorrow no matter what women papa will remember to give Emma lots and lots of lines she's really looking forward to her first performance all right now leave me I must be left alone to concentrate the writer needs peace and quiet there are some things I don't like about this script I'll discuss it with you after the performance sniff after if it's a story about lost children why do you have to have a stupid lion I'm too good an actor to be cast as a lion keep them out of my hair when indeed he's giving me a headache you come with me sniff we'll practice our parts this could be a wonderful play if you'd only skip the lions behind I've heard enough about this behind remember we have a lion's head too dying to show his acting skills on the stage this is my play and I refuse to write out the lion's part I refuse here's the key I want you to keep a keen eye on them until I come back do you understand me cousin are they very dangerous yes they certainly are they bite if you let them out okay we certainly wouldn't bite anyone obviously I've had enough of your lies don't listen to my dear cousin they do well then now I'm up to the theater to see the play take good care of them while I'm gone excuse me you seem to be a very good knitter oh thank you nobody ever said that to me before I enjoy it what are you making I'm not sure I don't really know nothing in particular it's just that knitting is so reassuring somehow nothing bad can happen while you knit can it trouble is I always seem to forget to decide what to make before I start but it feels nice and warm and I love the color couldn't you make socks it's a very nice sock color socks yes it's very very cold in here oh yes that's a very good idea listen if I knitted each one of you a pair of warm socks would you really put them on of course that will be nice I'm almost freezing to death in here it's so very very cold is it really that cold yes my teeth are chattering so I could hardly talk honestly oh dear oh dear what should I do maybe some steaming hot black currant juice would help to warm us up a little possibly although it might already be too late my cousin would be very angry with me if he knew but I think but you think why I think I'll let you out so that we can all be nice and warm indoors really don't cry now baby there's a good boy don't cry honey that's enough baby oh woman mama you need to show much more immersion it's right to be more motherly and more loving listen dear this is a very happy baby how am I doing woman papa you're just perfect for the part sniffing your performance was excellent maybe I should add a part with some lines in it look at these I think they might be ready by now I hope they're tasty they don't always come out very well you're so kind we've had so much already but they smell really delicious they sure do thank you so much now I feel warm again how about some more black currant juice or maybe one of these freshly baked cookies it's very kind of you but no thank you I couldn't eat another thing I'm so full up me too oh dear the party is over then I'm afraid so it's really sad but I have to lock you up again but at least I know you're warm in there we're really sorry too but you don't need to worry because actually we're not going back to jail oh aren't you we've got other plans we're going to the theater to see my parents play and I suppose I should say hello to my Aunt Emma who works there oh what shall I do my cousin will be very cross with me but you see we're innocent we didn't do anything wrong you didn't I swear it do I look like someone who pulls up signs in a park we just burned some flats and left by the flood but your cousin wouldn't believe it he jumped to conclusions wrongful arrest that's all it was oh dear why didn't you tell me that it once oh people shouldn't go to jail when they haven't done anything wrong so we can go to the theaters that okay of course better leave right away my cousin will be very disappointed but I guess I can't be helped wait for me I think I'd better come along and explain to that cousin of mind that his three prisoners are innocent of the charge against them all right all right bring it in that's right momma stop there okay sniff moment mama what have you got there a baby's crib I want to use this in the play if that's all right with you moment papa moment papa I just read your script and I think you have a
