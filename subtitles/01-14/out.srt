1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:58,000
there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-a!

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Have you ever heard of Moon and Valley?

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Deep white snow covers the whole valley, and everyone goes to sleep so that they keep warm.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Look, there's a woman house.

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
There's a woman, our hero.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A woman, a woman, a woman.

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A woman, a woman.

13
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
A woman, a woman.

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And this little bundle must be little my.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think before our story starts, we better wake everyone up with some spring sunshine.

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh!

17
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
At last! It's spring!

18
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Wake up, everyone! It's spring time!

19
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
A woman, a woman.

20
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
A woman.

21
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh, little my, you're up.

22
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's hard to stay asleep with you yelling.

23
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I can't help it if I'm happy.

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So yeah, woke me.

25
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I was having a lovely dream about living in a watermelon.

26
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But it's beautiful outside.

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh, gee, isn't. Is it really, woman?

28
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes, it's all fresh. The flowers are out and the sun is shining.

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, I like being asleep.

30
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But it's spring. You said you wanted me to wake you as soon as spring was here.

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh, boy, did I?

32
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes, you did, little my. You said you wanted to be a welcome as soon as spring was here.

33
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Really? Yes, you did.

34
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Did I say something like that?

35
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You can go back to bed if you want to. Nobody's making you get up, little my.

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No, there's really no point, movement. I'm not sleepy anymore.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, there you are then.

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Mama!

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Good spring, movement.

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Movement, mama. I'm starving. Have you got any watermelon?

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No, but there's lots of other things.

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We'll all have a nice big breakfast.

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I can hear a snuffkin.

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Good spring.

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Wouldn't it be quicker to use the stairs?

46
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
More fun this way.

47
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Are you going home now?

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes, thanks very much for letting me spend the winter here.

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't think your sister will be back yet, though. I'll go anyway.

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Snuffkin!

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh, hello, movement.

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's really good to see you, snuffkin.

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And you too?

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're back, Arley.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Aren't you having a good time?

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes, I was.

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But I didn't want to miss spring time in movement valley.

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What did you do?

59
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll tell you later.

60
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's go wake up, Snuff, and think of something exciting to do.

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't think I'll like it.

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He's still snoring, movement. I'll do it again.

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, that's done it.

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Come on, Snuff, it's spring. Snuffkin's here.

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Please go away, you two.

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We're going to do something really exciting.

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Like what, moment?

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I can think of more exciting things to do than this.

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, let's imagine that we're the first ever to climb this mountain.

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's such a clear day.

71
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We'll be able to see all of movement valley when we get to the top and the sea.

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Good morning, Mr. Emulance.

73
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Morning, moment.

74
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Are your father and mother up?

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes.

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Mama was when I came out.

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Good.

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll never understand how you can sleep for months on end.

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We like it.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh, yes.

81
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why do they always have to do something exciting?

82
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What a gorgeous view.

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It really is.

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hey, look, they're smoke coming from moment house.

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We should have stayed at home.

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The moment Mama's cooking something good.

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Look.

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What is it?

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We're not the first here after all.

90
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Look over there.

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
A top hat.

92
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hmm, a rather large one.

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I wonder who's how it is.

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't know, but I know papa would like it.

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Hmm, it's much too big.

96
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh dear, what's that?

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I can really get inside it.

98
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You see, I cover it for my old one.

99
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, I can't moment it.

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Stop, moment.

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No, that's enough nonsense as it can't take it off now.

102
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, damn.

103
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What's the matter?

104
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I can't move it. It's stuck, moment.

105
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll give you a hand.

106
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's harder.

107
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh, that's better.

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Thank you.

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What's all this noise?

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Papa's head got stuck in the hat, Mama.

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh, yes, and where did that come from?

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Oh, moment, Mama.

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The children found it when they were out and brought it back for me.

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's very smart.

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What shall we do with it, Papa?

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
There is something strange about it.

117
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Shall I throw it away then?

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, no. It's too good for that.

119
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Do we know anyone with a very big head?

120
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No, moment, Papa.

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I know what we can do with it.

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's a...

123
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
A waste paper basket, Mooma Mama.

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's right.

125
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well done, Snuffkin.

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That was easy.

127
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Come on, Snuffkin.

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Come and have some breakfast with us.

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Hmm, beautiful.

130
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes.

131
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Sorry to disturb you, but I'm going to see Moomin.

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Uh-huh.

133
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Do you want to come with me, Snork?

134
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Uh-huh.

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Or would you rather stay here?

136
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Uh-huh.

137
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Well, are you coming or not?

138
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Uh-huh.

139
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Not coming, man?

140
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Uh-huh.

141
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Snork?

142
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, you know my flying ship is almost finished.

143
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It'll be ready this year.

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You'll see.

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is an historic moment.

146
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh, dear.

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Perhaps it needs a little more work.

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I wonder if you really can make a flying ship.

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Don't be silly, of course you can't.

150
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
A little, my Snorks always dreamed about doing it.

151
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Dreams were all right.

152
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes, as long as they're not impossible.

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know.

154
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yes, as long as they're not impossible.

155
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I suppose so.

156
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hmm.

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Sniff, you're not still feeding your face, are you?

158
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Do you ever dream, Sniff?

159
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Only nightmares about having no food at all, little my.

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Hmm.

161
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I wonder who dropped this.

162
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Where can I put it?

163
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh, there you are.

164
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Just a thing.

165
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Wow.

166
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Golly, what are they?

167
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
They're clouds.

168
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Be careful.

169
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Don't touch it.

170
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It might be poisonous.

171
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It feels like cotton.

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, ee.

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is great.

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm floating.

175
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Wonderful.

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh.

177
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Can I try it?

178
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes.

179
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Wow.

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Golly, what are they?

181
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
They're clouds.

182
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Be careful.

183
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't touch it.

184
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It might be poisonous.

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It feels like cotton.

186
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, ee.

187
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is great.

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Can I try it?

189
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Are you ready, Snork Maiden?

190
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Here we go.

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah.

192
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What have you got to hide?

193
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
My phone.

194
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Wait for me.

195
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Hey.

196
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
There's a wait for me.

197
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Whoa.

198
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Whoa.

199
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Whoa.

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Hey, wait for me.

201
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Let me get on.

202
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Whoa.

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Whoa.

204
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Help!

205
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm falling.

206
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Mumen Papa is in his study trying to write his memoirs.

207
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
A lot has happened to him over the years.

208
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
An awful lot.

209
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And he's trying to remember it.

210
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What was that?

211
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Mumen.

212
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Hi, Papa.

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What are you doing out there?

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We're flying.

215
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The clouds just came out of the house.

216
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Try and get mirrors so I can reach you.

217
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Oh.

218
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No, I'm alright.

219
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Why don't you come for a ride?

220
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Stop.

221
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Wait a minute.

222
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's great.

223
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You feel like a bird.

224
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Mumen.

225
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh.

226
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Come on, Papa.

227
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Jump or you'll fall.

228
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I hate it.

229
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's alright.

230
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh.

231
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Whoa.

232
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Mumen Mama quickly.

233
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What's the matter?

234
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Have you seen what the children are doing?

235
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes.

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Look at them.

237
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
They're flying about on clouds.

238
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It can't be safe.

239
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Don't worry, Papa.

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's alright.

241
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I told them to be careful.

242
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Come on, Snappy.

243
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Come on.

244
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I won.

245
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I won.

246
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I won.

247
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Whoa.

248
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Hey, wait a minute.

249
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Little cloud.

250
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Wait for me.

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Don't go away.

252
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh.

253
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, I got you.

254
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That is three cotton.

255
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm going to climb right up here.

256
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And I'm going to get you right there.

257
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Come on.

258
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Come on, little cloud.

259
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm going to take you with me.

260
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Hey, come on.

261
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You just keep coming back.

262
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yeah.

263
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm going to take you.

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yeah.

265
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I got you now.

266
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You are going to get away from me.

267
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Here I go.

268
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Come on.

269
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
All of that ledge.

270
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Come on.

271
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I want you to play.

272
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh.

273
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh.

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh.

275
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh.

276
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Oh.

277
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh.

278
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh.

279
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh, boy.

280
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What's happening?

281
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
My cloud's starting to go.

282
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh.

283
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Whoa.

284
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That was fun.

285
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yeah, it was, but I wasn't ready to stop.

286
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Look.

287
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
There's movement in snorkemaiden.

288
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Hey.

289
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hey.

290
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why have they still got cloud snuffed in?

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
There's a starting to go as well.

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I think they'd better get off.

293
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Hey.

294
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Right.

295
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll start counting.

296
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
One, two, three.

297
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Do you want something little mind?

298
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes.

299
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
A place to hide.

300
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Five, six, seven.

301
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Boy, I don't think there's any place to hide.

302
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And here is there.

303
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
No.

304
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh.

305
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's too dirty in there.

306
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I know.

307
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'll hide in the head.

308
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Ooh.

309
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Ooh.

310
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Ooh.

311
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Ooh.

312
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
One, two, one, two, one.

313
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Hey.

314
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Huh?

315
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Huh?

316
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Huh?

317
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Huh?

318
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Huh?

319
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Huh?

320
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Huh?

321
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Huh?

322
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Huh?

323
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Huh?

324
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Huh?

325
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Huh?

326
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Huh?

327
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Huh?

328
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Huh?

329
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Huh?

330
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Huh?

331
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Huh?

332
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Huh?

333
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Huh?

334
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Huh?

335
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Huh.

336
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Huh.

337
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Huh?

338
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Huh?

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Uh-huh.

340
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Gotcha.

341
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Huh?

342
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Huh?

343
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Huh?

344
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Slork made.

345
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:30,480
Well, last time I saw him, he was hiding in the fireplace.

346
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,280
Have you found him yet?

347
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,880
Have you looked in the cellar?

348
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,080
Yes, I have.

349
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,720
Wait a minute, did you hear someone laughing?

350
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,560
Where'd it come from?

351
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,760
G.I. better go home.

352
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Oh, is there anything wrong?

353
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,800
Yes, I can't find moment anywhere.

354
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,200
Well, he's too fat to be most places.

355
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:58,200
To come in from under the hat.

356
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:05,040
Well, here I am, sniff.

357
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,240
Oh, on earth are you.

358
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,480
I one land didn't I.

359
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,080
You looked everywhere in the house, and you couldn't find me, couldn't you?

360
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,080
So I won.

361
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,280
Who would want to find you anyway?

362
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,720
Well, you were trying hard enough, weren't you?

363
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,920
What is this in your game?

364
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,920
My name's Snork Maiden.

365
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,200
What's yours?

366
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm the King of Moomin Valley, my pretty one.

367
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,160
You're too ugly to be the King of anything.

368
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,120
Well, now, that's not a very nice thing to say to your friend.

369
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,320
Is it Papa?

370
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,080
Now, you'd better tell me what you have done with Moomin.

371
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,360
But I'm here.

372
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,560
Where?

373
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,640
Right here.

374
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:54,040
Who are you, and where is Moomin?

375
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
Papa.

376
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,080
I'm certainly not your Papa.

377
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,080
Yes, you are.

378
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,760
Come on.

379
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,720
I'm Moomin.

380
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,120
I don't know who you are, but you're not Moomin.

381
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,880
He's nice and handsome and nothing like you.

382
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,160
Have you looked at yourself in a mirror?

383
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,880
But where's my nose gone?

384
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,720
Oh, there's nothing there anymore.

385
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,920
Oh, no, my tail's all pushy.

386
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,080
Oh, no!

387
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,920
Oh!

388
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,320
Here!

389
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,320
This is terrible!

390
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Oh!

391
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,920
Who are you?

392
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,720
What have you done with me?

393
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,920
It must be a nightmare!

394
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,320
I want to come back.

395
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,520
Go away, you're horrible.

396
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,840
Dear me, what's all this noise?

397
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,520
What's happened?

398
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,840
Mama!

399
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,680
Mama!

400
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,160
Mama!

401
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,720
What earth is this?

402
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,080
He says he's Moomin, but just look at him.

403
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,120
You don't look like I'm Moomin.

404
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,680
I am, I am.

405
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,600
Please believe me, Mama.

406
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,080
I am Moomin.

407
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,720
Well, I don't know.

408
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,120
I'm sure.

409
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,280
Something's happened to me.

410
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,080
Why do I look so different?

411
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,920
Now then calm down.

412
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,480
This won't help at all.

413
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,200
We don't need all this noise.

414
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,080
If you really are Moomin, then everything will be all right.

415
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,200
Just give me a minute or two and I'll know.

416
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,480
Mama, call me Moomin, please.

417
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,560
I don't know what's happened, but I am me.

418
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,960
Honestly, I am.

419
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,600
Mama, please believe me.

420
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,000
I am Moomin.

421
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,320
Let me see.

422
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,480
Oh, Mama, you do know it's me.

423
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,400
You must, you can't forget your little Moomin,

424
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,640
please, Mama, please, Mama.

425
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,680
Oh, hush now, hush now.

426
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,680
Mama!

427
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Shh!

428
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,480
Yes, you're my little Moomin, all right.

429
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh, Mama!

430
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,480
Ah!

431
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,760
Ah!

432
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Oh!

433
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
A Moomin!

434
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Papa?

435
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,160
A Moomin, my boy.

436
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Where were you hiding?

437
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,160
In there.

438
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
In the hat?

439
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Let's hope it's the last we'll see of it.

440
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,080
Moomin, Papa, decided that although it was a fine hat,

441
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,440
it was too dangerous to keep.

442
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,240
So Moomin threw it in the river and it floated away.

443
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
He wasn't too sure about it, though,

444
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,240
because it was a rather special hat.

445
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,240
They love the laughter and they love the laughter.

446
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,240
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.

447
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:21,240
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

448
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,240
They're always happy and always at play.

449
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:32,240
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

450
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:42,240
They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.

451
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

452
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,240
They're always happy and always at play.

453
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:01,240
The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.

454
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,240
The Moomin's.

455
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,240
The Moomin's.

456
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:21,240
The Moomin's.

457
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:29,240
The Moomin's.

458
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,240
Here they are for one and all.

459
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,240
The Moomin's are about to call.

460
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,240
Come on and sit down here with me.

461
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,240
They're here for you on your TV.

462
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,240
They are the Moomin's.

463
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,240
They are the Moomin's.

464
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,240
So come with me, give me your hand.

465
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,240
I'll take you up to Moomin land.

466
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,240
You can fly just like a bird.

467
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Sing that song ever.

468
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,240
There were the Moomin's.

469
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,240
There were the Moomin's.

470
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:14,240
There were the Moomin's.

471
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
There were the Moomin's.

472
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

474
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,240
Mumin loves to spend as much time as he can with his friend, Snuffkin.

475
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
Snuffkin?

476
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,240
Snuffkin?

477
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
Where are you?

478
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,240
He must have forgotten I was coming and gone off somewhere.

479
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
How can he enjoy being here on his own?

480
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,240
I'd like to be alone now and then you know.

481
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
Oh, silly. Let's go and explore.

482
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,240
Let's leave it till tomorrow, Snark Maiden.

483
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,240
But we said we'd go today.

484
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
Yeah, we did too, Mumin.

485
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
You are the one that said it, you know.

486
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,240
Hmm, you did. I didn't.

487
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
You did too.

488
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
Oh, you must come.

489
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
We're going to collect shells on the beach.

490
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Come on. It'll be fun.

491
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,240
Oh, no.

492
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Hey!

493
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
It's Snuff.

494
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Where are you guys going?

495
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Oh, I envy Snuffkin.

496
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
Oh, why?

497
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,240
I just do.

498
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
I wonder where Snuffkin has gone.

499
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,240
I wonder if we'll ever find anything as exciting as the hat.

500
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Yeah, it was very special that hat.

501
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,240
Did you really throw it in the river?

502
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Yeah.

503
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
I wish you hadn't.

504
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
It was much too dangerous to keep.

505
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,240
Look at the horrible things it did to me.

506
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,240
But what about the eggshells it turned into clouds?

507
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Yeah, it was good fun flying around.

508
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,240
Perhaps I'll find an oyster with a huge pearl inside.

509
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
Snuffkin.

510
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Moment.

511
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
Moment.

512
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Moment.

513
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,240
Moment.

514
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Wake up.

515
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Snork made me tell.

516
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
What?

517
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
What's happened?

518
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,240
We were playing tag and she fell into an ant lion hole.

519
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
We've got to get her out quickly.

520
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
Come on, moving.

521
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Nearly there, Snork Maiden.

522
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
Just a bit further.

523
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Help me, Snuff.

524
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Give me your hand.

525
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Hurry.

526
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Look out.

527
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
It's the ant lion.

528
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
Look what you're doing to my hole.

529
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
I'm sorry.

530
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
I'll be out soon.

531
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Stop yelling and kicking like that.

532
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
You're scaring off my prey.

533
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
Are you all right, Snork Maiden?

534
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
I can't reach her.

535
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,240
I don't have to have ants for lunch, you know.

536
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Don't be a woman, please.

537
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,240
You better get in there, Sniff.

538
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
What?

539
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Me?

540
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,240
Don't worry.

541
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
I'll hold on to you.

542
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
You're the only one tall enough, Sniff.

543
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
Come on.

544
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
You look nice and tasty.

545
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
I'll eat you and Sniff.

546
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
You look nice and tasty.

547
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
I'll eat you and Sniff.

548
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
Good Sniff.

549
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Look, hi.

550
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Get in there.

551
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
You're big.

552
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
Where you from?

553
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,400
You thought you called me a bigWhen.

554
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,240
Woah!

555
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,240
You gotta grab.

556
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
Scoughter Right now.

557
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Snork Me.

558
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
Thank you.

559
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,240
Thank you.

560
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Right.

561
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
Are you ready?

562
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
Hold tight.

563
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Come on, nearly a bit.

564
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Ah!

565
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
Ah!

566
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
Come on, nearly a bit.

567
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,240
Ah!

568
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
Ah!

569
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
Ah!

570
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,240
Where have you been, self-kin?

571
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
That's a big, secret movement.

572
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
I won't tell anyone.

573
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
All right. It's the magic hat.

574
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
It's on a sandbank further down the river.

575
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
Gosh!

576
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
But something terrible is happening.

577
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,240
What? What is it?

578
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,240
Oh dear, perhaps we shouldn't have thrown it in the river.

579
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
It's too late now.

580
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Let's go.

581
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,240
It's too late now.

582
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
Let's get there, cooking.

583
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,240
There it is. It's caught on a branch in the middle.

584
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,240
Where? Oh, Smovkin, I can see it.

585
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,240
Look at the water. It's all red.

586
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,240
Hmm. Seems to be coming from the hat.

587
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
I wonder what it is, move.

588
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
I won't get it.

589
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,240
Be careful.

590
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,240
Shall I come too?

591
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,240
No, you stay there.

592
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Have you got it?

593
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,240
Uh-huh.

594
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Wow! It's raspberry juice.

595
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
What should we do with the hat?

596
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Well, I don't think it's a good idea to leave it lying around.

597
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,240
Somebody might crawl into it.

598
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,240
But if we put water in it, we can have as much raspberry juice as we can drink.

599
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,240
Well, that would be nice.

600
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,240
But you know, movement.

601
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,240
It could only be river water that does that.

602
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,240
You know what I mean, movement?

603
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,240
Well, I think it's worth experimenting.

604
00:30:51,240 --> 00:31:00,240
...

605
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,240
What's the matter, moving? You look very tired.

606
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,240
I woke up in the night and couldn't get back to sleep.

607
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Ha, pardon?

608
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
Couldn't get back to sleep.

609
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,240
Ha, what are you talking about?

610
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,240
I was awake last night too.

611
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
And I know why you're so tired.

612
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,240
You must have been dreaming.

613
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

614
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,240
Thanks, mama.

615
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,240
Where are you going, Moomin?

616
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
Moomin!

617
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
Somewhere you can't come.

618
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
Somewhere private.

619
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,240
So, what was that all about, huh?

620
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,240
Oh, nothing really important, Moomin, Papa.

621
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
I think I'll go out.

622
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
Ha, ha.

623
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,240
Nobody hides anything from little, my.

624
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
Snopkin!

625
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
Hey, I found out who's had it is.

626
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,240
Who's?

627
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,240
The Hobgoblins.

628
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
The Hobgoblins.

629
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:30,240
Yeah, I asked the Hemmielin and he told me that he saw him once, long ago wearing that.

630
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,240
I heard about the wizard who flies in the sky.

631
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,240
Yeah, on the back of a black panther.

632
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,240
The Hobgoblins is hundreds of years old and cares only for rubies.

633
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,240
He rides all over the world, searching for them.

634
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
He's truly awesome.

635
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
And so, when he dropped his hat?

636
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,240
He must have been looking for some rubies right here in Moomin Valley.

637
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,240
Do you think he's got a lot of hats, Snopkin?

638
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Gee, I don't know.

639
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,240
Well, do you think perhaps he doesn't know where he dropped his hat?

640
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,240
Yeah, I suppose that's possible.

641
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,240
Snopkin!

642
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,240
There's something I would like to try with the hat.

643
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240
Just don't put it on.

644
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,240
Will you?

645
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
He's in there somewhere.

646
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,240
Hat lions are pretty stupid, you know.

647
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,240
Yes, Moomin Papa told me it takes him hours to dig themselves into the sand.

648
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
Oh, no, it doesn't.

649
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,240
It only takes him one hour.

650
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Only an hour?

651
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
You're kidding.

652
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,240
Well, of course, an hour is a long time to spend, digging.

653
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,240
Are you talking about me?

654
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,240
Yes, about how quickly you could dig yourself into a hole in the sand.

655
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,240
A lot quicker than you think it'll take.

656
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Moomin here says it takes you only one hour to dig a hole in the sand.

657
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
But I can't believe that.

658
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,240
Snopkin says it takes several hours, but I think he's wrong.

659
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,240
I'll show you how long.

660
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Gosh, that was rather fast.

661
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,240
Yeah, but it's obvious he's already got a ready-made hole hidden there.

662
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
Don't you ant lion.

663
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
No, I do not.

664
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,240
I can dig myself in anywhere, anywhere at all.

665
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
How about here?

666
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,240
Yeah, okay.

667
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,240
Under this rock.

668
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,240
All right?

669
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,240
Anywhere.

670
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,240
Just show me.

671
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,240
Okay, start from here.

672
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
Yeah, just there if you don't mind.

673
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,240
All right, start counting.

674
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Wow, you only took a second and a half.

675
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,240
He's really something, isn't he?

676
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
He certainly is.

677
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,240
I'd better sit on it.

678
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,240
Yeah, he'll be a really mad.

679
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,240
So you've caught the ant lion.

680
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
I've been watching.

681
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
Little boy.

682
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
Right.

683
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,240
Did you follow us last night?

684
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,240
Yes.

685
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
Oh, did you tell the others?

686
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,240
Oh, don't be silly you guys.

687
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,240
I haven't said a word yet.

688
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,240
But you will if we don't let you join in with us.

689
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
That's what she's doing, movement.

690
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,240
No, as if I do such a thing.

691
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,240
Of course, I'm forgetting how nice and kind you are.

692
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,240
Hey.

693
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
Hey, what is that?

694
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,240
Nope, no hat anywhere.

695
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,240
There's gallons of water.

696
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,240
Gosh, there sure must be a lot of sand in there.

697
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,240
He must have changed into something else by now.

698
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,240
Probably.

699
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,240
It must have been long enough.

700
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Oh, jump off.

701
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,240
He isn't strong enough to move the rock by himself.

702
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
Shall we help him?

703
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,240
No, don't.

704
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
Come on, let's do it.

705
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,240
What's happened to him?

706
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,240
Let's turn it over.

707
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Oh, no, I can't look.

708
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,240
I'll give it a try.

709
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
Oh.

710
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
It's a hedgehog.

711
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,240
It's a sword.

712
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,240
It's a sword.

713
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,240
Shoot.

714
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
You!

715
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
You!

716
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
Waaaah!

717
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240
It's a cow!

718
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,240
Yeah!

719
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,240
You!

720
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,240
Waaaah!

721
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,240
You!

722

00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:53,960
you came along when you did mr. hub goblin you're most kind madam I don't suppose you'd have

768
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,080
any uncommonly large rubies here would you you finding my hat here must be an omen

769
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:11,400
here you are mr. hub goblin my husband moman papa gave it to me it is fine indeed and you are

770
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:17,560
lucky to have it but I'm afraid it is not the king's ruby I am looking for what do you mean king's

771
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:24,440
ruby I have searched for it for hundreds of years moman mama I'm afraid I am obsessed by it and cannot

772
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:30,760
find it anywhere well if we see it we'll light a signal fire you are most kind madam and I feel

776
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,160
and so the hub goblin's hat finally disappeared from moman valley

777
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,480
moman rather missed having an ever-ending supply of raspberry juice but his parents were more

778
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,480

779
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,480

00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:07,480
believing in sharing and caring and giving the moman

782
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:17,480

792
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:21,240

nice snuffkin hello moman didn't think you were coming sorry I'm late what's that

827
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:54,240
a leaf boat look it sails on the river just like a real one

828
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:00,240
I bet it goes all the way down to the sea and maybe even to some foreign lands

829
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,240
gosh snuffkin I'd like to do that one day let's go then shall we

830
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:10,240
little my wanted to come but I told you it was too dangerous

831
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:16,240
hmm perhaps it wasn't the best thing to say look

832
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:24,240
I thought they could use a bit of fun wait oh man

833
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:32,240
are we really going to climb up there look I don't think we can all go it'll just be

834
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:38,240
moving in me I'm not climbing up there well I am wouldn't you like to keep me

835
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,240
company instead look there's a cave just a little bit further along this path

836
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,240
why don't you two girls wait for a sec we won't be long

837
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,240
but if you can walk to it why on earth climb to it

838
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,240
difficult for a girl to understand well I think boys are difficult to understand

839
00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:00,240
we're not sure we can reach it from above well we'll soon find out

840
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,240
are you coming with a sniff oh I think I'll guard the rear protect the cave

841
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:12,240
from below oh yeah well someone has to look after the girls someone responsible

842
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:36,240
oh my goodness it's dark in there let's go in then I don't like the look of it

843
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:42,240
we'd better stay out here you never know who might live in there don't be silly

844
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,240
no one lives in there that's what I don't like yes exactly a place

845
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:55,240
with no one living in it is really scary I think we must be right above the cave

846
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:03,240
here maybe I can't find a hole though let's look a bit more over that way moving

847
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:10,240

866
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:17,240
I'm sure I heard somebody scream just now well the Himmelin was down here having a nap

867
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:22,240
the Himmelin if this is another of your games woman I don't like it Mr. Himmelin

868
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,240
we were climbing down from the top we didn't know you were sleep

869
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:30,240
that's not quite right I wasn't asleep I wasn't the tall comfortable you know well

870
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:35,240
what were you doing here then well to tell you the truth I really haven't been quite

871
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:40,240
myself lately you haven't lost any more rare stabs have you Mr. Himmelin

872
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:47,240
and the contrary movement I have them all even the rarest every single one

873
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:53,240
then what's wrong that's good isn't it I mean my collection is complete

874
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:58,240
and no one in the world has a better stab collection than you have Mr. Himmelin

875
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:04,240
no of course not mine is perfect there isn't a stamp I haven't got rare ones old ones

876
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:09,240
misprinted ones I have them all I still don't understand there's no challenge

877
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:15,240
nothing to search for you're too young and you don't collect stamps oh dear me dear me

878
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:22,240
I'm beginning to understand he's not a collector anymore he's got all the stamps

879
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:28,240
he could ever want that's a trouble it's not half as much fun that's why you're sad

880
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:37,240
isn't it Mr. Himmelin yes it is no fun no fun at all no I understand I can see

881
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:41,240
why you're upset and me falling on top of you like that did it really help did

882
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:48,240
it not exactly moment look who was taking a nap in the cave

883
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:54,240
oh it's you Mr. Himmelin so it must have been his snoring that we heard what a

884
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:04,240
noise he was making I'd never ever snore you certainly do

885
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:11,240
Robbys look if you promise not to tell anyone I'll take you to see something very special

886
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,240
what is it

887
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:37,240
I think it could be repaired of course it could easy but you know you can't always tell

888
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:42,240
the keel doesn't look too good yes we could take it out to see a no time the sales

889
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:51,240
got holes in it hey I can't find any owners you can paddle all steer look out friends

890
00:59:51,240 --> 01:00:10,240
it's going over hang on everybody I've lost my confidence and it makes me feel very

891
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:17,240
unhappy well it can happen to anyone you know even to you well not much of course

892
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:23,240
lucky you I just don't know what to do how can I get it back there must be a way

893
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:34,240
it's hard to say everybody's different but with me it just happens I don't think

894
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:41,240
I'll ever invent anything again perhaps I'll have a break from my memoirs too

895
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,800
tea time oh dear what's the matter with you too you look a bit down in the

896
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:54,240
dance you know I might have been a bit overconfident me too I think

897
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:03,240
there's no need to yell we can hear you watch the matter sniff

898
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:10,240
we found a boat on the beach come and have a look a shipwreck washed up on the shore

899
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:17,240
it's not a wreck and it's got a white sail we're going to repair it and then it'll be ours

900
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:22,240
all right I'm coming come on snork let's take a look at this boat it could be

901
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:27,240
just the thing the chair is both up so it's got a sail a white sail you say

902
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:36,240
that could be extremely interesting it's a sturdy little craft is nicely built well

903
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:46,240
designed she's abandoned so does that we can keep her

904
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:51,240
it seems to be in pretty good condition except for the hole in the bottom you

905
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:56,240
know maybe that's why she was abandoned here you could be right softkin finders

906
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:01,240
keepers you guys of course it makes it our boat you'd have to wait to see if anyone

907
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:06,240
claims it first little mine what shall we do then papa well first things first

908
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:13,240
we must repair the hole and then tire up securely in case there's a storm absolutely

909
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:20,240
then if the owner comes we ought to give her back to him mind you she might know

910
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:27,240
she's here so what are we going to do when we've repaired her it's bad for boats not

911
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:38,240
to be yours we could sail the seven seas I'd be happy just to explore around here

912
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:43,240
don't worry snork maiden if we get big waves we can sail between them isn't that right

913
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:52,240
moment papa well in a way come on let's get to work how about you snork will you help us

914
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:59,240
yes of course can I do anything for you moment papa yes if you'd like to Mr. Emulane well

915
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:04,240
I'm afraid I'm not much of a builder but if there is something I could do well let's

916
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:11,240
get her out of the water first shall we and we'll need some big logs to go under

917
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:21,240
I think ten should be enough I'll be safe to work on so we'll want something strong

918
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:28,240
to keep her upright as well and lots of tools I'll go home and get some and I think we'll

919
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:35,240
need a bucket and a shovel I'll come with you help you choose yes you go I'll stay

920
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,240
and keep guard in case the owner comes back

921
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:25,240
sleep well man the top sales what are they all in bed my dear yes dear sleeping

922

968
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:26,840
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

969
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:44,760
It was a lovely day, and Mumen, his family and friends decided to go for a trip in the

970
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:49,560
boat they'd found washed up on the beach. They didn't know where they were going, and thought

971
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,320
it would be much more fun that way.

972
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,720
Momma, we're not going away forever, you know.

973
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,920
I hope not.

974
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,320
I don't think we'll need all these pots and pans.

975
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,480
It's best to be prepared at sea.

976
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,360
What do you mean?

977
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,800
Well, you'll only complain if you don't get a hot meal.

978
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,080
I never complain.

979
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:11,080
And you know how hungry the sea air made you all last time we went out on a boat.

980
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,520
You'd have been glad of food then.

981
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,040
You got to rough it a bit if you want an adventure.

982
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,760
Yes, but it will be more fun with coffee and pancakes.

983
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,880
Aren't you too ready yet?

984
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,080
Hello, Mumen!

985
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,320
Hi, snorkebagel!

986
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,760
Whoa!

987
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,200
Must you use that ladder?

988
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:51,960
I'm all right.

989
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,520
Mumen, you're going to hurt yourself one of these days.

990
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,560
It's good practice.

991
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,760
It's not coming with us.

992
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:01,000
He says he hasn't got time for sailing boats at the moment.

993
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,760
I'd much rather a real sailing boat than a paper flying ship any day.

994
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,640
Our mama and papa are ready yet?

995
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,640
They're packing a path the kitchen.

996
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,640
Oh, it's too full.

997
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,880
Have we got to take all that with us?

998
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,640
Our mama thinks it's better to be safe than sorry and she's usually right.

999
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,840
Tell me, Mumen, where exactly are we going?

1000
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,360
We haven't decided yet.

1001
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,320
That's right.

1002
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,360
Wait and see.

1003
01:13:37,320 --> 01:14:02,760
Mr. Hamulin, have you found a rare plan for your collection yet?

1004
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,360
Unfortunately not.

1005
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,840
There are lots of these in Mumen Valley already.

1006
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,400
Goodness, where are you taking all that?

1007
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,080
We're going sailing.

1008
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:14,360
How exciting, charting new seas and exploring desert islands.

1009
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,800
Never know.

1010
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:26,040
If I help you load up the boat, can I please come with you?

1011
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:43,560
Captain of Ridge, down the yard arm, hankers away, sailors beware, splice the manbrace,

1012
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,880
all hands on deck, full speed ahead.

1013
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,280
Hey, Sniff, any sun of the movements?

1014
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,080
Not yet.

1015
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,240
It's a great day to go sailing.

1016
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,080
I wonder where we're going.

1017
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,840
I don't have any idea.

1018
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:59,160
I don't actually like sailing much.

1019
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,160
Do you get sick?

1020
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,520
Well, not really sick.

1021
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,440
It's just that I can't swim.

1022
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,480
And if it's rough, it frightens me and I panic a bit.

1023
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,240
It looks like it's going to stay calm.

1024
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,120
So don't worry.

1025
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,440
Right, that's the lot.

1026
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,280
Now, all aboard.

1027
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:24,040
Mama, little Mai, Stafkin, Moomin,

1028
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,800
Snork Maiden, and Mr. Hambylin' of course.

1029
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,320
Isn't he a bit old for adventures?

1030
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,040
Not at all.

1031
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:34,360
No, Moomin' Papa has promised to find a deserted island where I shall search for rare plants.

1032
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:39,480
Don't you want to go?

1033
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,320
Do you want to go?

1034
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:41,960
No, move it, you.

1035
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,280
Come on, Sniff, hurry up.

1036
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:50,440
There's no rum.

1037
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,200
Don't be silly, Sniff.

1038
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:52,840
Of course there is.

1039
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:58,200
It looks very full, almost thinking.

1040
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,600
There's no way this boat could sink.

1041
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,880
Now, come on, get him.

1042
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:02,680
Oh.

1043
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,360
Really?

1044
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,360
I promise it'll be all right.

1045
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:09,360
Won't it, Papa?

1046
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,360
Well, if it stays like this, it will.

1047
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,360
Moment.

1048
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,360
I'll come next time.

1049
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,360
Let's go, moment, Papa.

1050
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,360
He's just a scary cat.

1051
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,360
Hmm.

1052
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,360
We'll go without you then, Snape.

1053
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,360
Hmm.

1054
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,360
I think that will be best.

1055
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,360
Anyway, someone had better stay and look after moment house

1056
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,360
and it might just as well be me.

1057
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,360
That's very thoughtful of you.

1058
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,360
There's a pancake on the kitchen table

1059
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,360
that you can have for lunch.

1060
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,360
Thank you, Mama.

1061
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,360
Have a nice trip.

1062
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,360
I wish Sniff had come.

1063
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,360
He's a big softie.

1064
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:51,360
Well, he's not very good at swimming

1065
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,360
and he does eat rather a lot.

1066
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,360
This is the life, isn't it, Mama?

1067
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,360
It certainly is, dear.

1068
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,360
This is the life, isn't it, Mama?

1069
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,360
It certainly is, dear.

1070
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:34,360
Oh, look, not a breath of wind.

1071
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,360
Shall I start rowing, Papa?

1072
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,360
Yes, you'd better get Sniffkin to help you.

1073
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,360
Aye-aye, Captain.

1074
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,360
It's hardly moving.

1075
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,360
You'll have to do better than that.

1076
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,360
We're doing our best.

1077
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:52,360
You two would be useless as galley slaves.

1078
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,360
It's good that we're not then, isn't it?

1079
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,360
So then, what's your excuse?

1080
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,360
It's not easy rowing against the tide.

1081
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,360
You try it.

1082
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:03,360
No, dear, at this rate, I should be lucky

1083
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,360
to find one rare plant.

1084
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,360
Well, Mr. Hamlin, you could always try

1085
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,360
collecting some seaweed instead.

1086
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,360
There's plenty of that.

1087
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,360
I have heard tales that if you whistle,

1088
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,360
those who perished at sea will send you a wind.

1089
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,360
Land! Ahoy!

1090
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,360
Look, Moomin, Papa!

1091
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:26,360
That's too small to be any good.

1092
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,360
You're right.

1093
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,360
Hey, look, Papa! We're moving again!

1094
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,360
The tide's turned and the wind's up.

1095
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,360
What a beautiful island!

1096
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,360
And a perfect place to land, too.

1097
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:52,360
Oh, I bet this place has got some rare plants.

1098
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,360
Be careful when you explore.

1099
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,360
There could be wild animals there.

1100
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,360
Now it's time to go.

1101
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,360
Let's go.

1102
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,360
I'll be careful when you explore.

1103
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,360
There could be wild animals there.

1104
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,360
Now if someone will go and collect some wood,

1105
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,360
I'll get a fire started.

1106
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:13,360
I bet none of you will say no to coffee and pancakes.

1107
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,360
Watch me, you land lovers.

1108
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,360
I'll go and pull the boat ashore.

1109
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,360
I suppose you're right.

1110
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,360
As I said, Papa, it's always better to rough it

1111
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,360
with a little bit of luxury.

1112
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,360
I wonder if we're the first to set foot on the island.

1113
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,360
Thank you, children.

1114
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,360
Is there anything else you want us to do?

1115
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,360
No, I don't think so.

1116
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,360
Is it okay if I go explore the island?

1117
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,360
Of course, off you go.

1118
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,360
Coming, Snork, may done.

1119
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,360
I'll stay and help Moomin Mama with the cooking.

1120
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,360
Mama, you said we needed firewood.

1121
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,360
Is this enough?

1122
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,360
My goodness for a lot.

1123
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,360
You know, I don't think anyone lives on this island.

1124
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:14,360
I haven't seen anyone unless they're hiding in the bushes.

1125
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,360
I've seen someone.

1126
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:17,360
Oh yeah?

1127
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,360
Who?

1128
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,360
Well, they weren't very big.

1129
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,360
What do you mean, this big?

1130
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,360
Well, same as me.

1131
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,360
What did they look like?

1132
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,360
Sort of white and ghostly and not very friendly looking either.

1133
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:29,360
Well, you probably just thought you saw something a little mic.

1134
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,360
I did see them. I did too.

1135
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,360
Keep your hair on.

1136
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,360
I'm not saying you didn't see anything.

1137
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:41,360
Goodness, this is magnificent.

1138
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:44,360
Oh, what a find.

1139
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:48,360
And what's this?

1140
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,360
I don't know.

1141
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,360
Oh, I don't know anything.

1142
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,360
What's this?

1143
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:07,360
What's this?

1144
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:15,360
Oh, well, well, well.

1145
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,360
I've never seen such rare and beautiful mountains.

1146
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:22,360
It's never seen such rare and beautiful plants.

1147
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,360
Well, what's this? Goodness, it's a perimeter.

1148
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:45,360
Now, let's see. Rain and storm. Probably broken.

1149
01:21:48,360 --> 01:22:02,360
Oh, hello. Who are you? Oh, I see. This is your perimeter, isn't it? Now watch it. Mind you don't travel on those flowers, will you?

1150
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:11,360
Oh, no, no, no. They're coming to get me. Don't go away. Don't go away.

1151
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:23,360
I think what little my saw was a hatty fattener. They're not ghosts, are they snuffkin? No, they look kind of like it, but they're really harmless enough movement.

1152
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:30,360
Oh, dear, what on earth was that? It sounded like Mr. Hamulin.

1153
01:22:41,360 --> 01:23:10,360
That's it, that's what I saw. It's Mr. Hamulin. Help, get me down.

1154
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:20,360
Why are they after you, Mr. Hamulin? What'd you do to them? I don't know. I just tapped on this post and asked them to be careful with the flowers.

1155
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:26,360
They seem a bit angry to me. Well, then I tapped the marrometer to check the weather, and they came at me.

1156
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:31,360
Well, I don't think it's a flower somat about. Maybe they thought you were trying to steal the marrometer.

1157
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:38,360
I don't want it to keep it. My goodness, I'm collecting flowers, not marrometers. Well, hang on.

1158
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:46,360
I can't hang on much longer, hurry, please. They don't look so easily frightened. No, now let me think.

1159
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:50,360
Hurry, I'm slipping.

1160
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:58,360
I've got it, Mr. Hamulin. The hatty fattener can't see or hear very well, but they are very sensitive. We'll have to try and frighten them.

1161
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:07,360
I suggest you shake the post as hard as you can. Harder, harder, Mr. Hamulin.

1162
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:14,360
Look, they can feel the ground moving. Keep going, Mr. Hamulin.

1163
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:20,360
I'm getting very tired. I've been touched if I can't.

1164
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:25,360
They're not going, it's no fun. Are you sure this will work?

1165
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:42,360
You can stop now, Mr. Hemmilan.

1166
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:44,360
Mr. Hemmilan!

1167
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,360
Oh dear!

1168
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:51,360
Hey, are you all right, Mr. Hemmilan?

1169
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,360
What disgusting creatures!

1170
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:57,360
I have a good mind to take their precious barometer.

1171
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,360
I don't think that's such a good idea.

1172
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,360
It's no good anyway, it's not working.

1173
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,360
How do you know that, Mr. Hemmilan?

1174
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,360
Look, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?

1175
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:12,360
But according to this barometer, it should be pouring down with rain.

1176
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,360
This is the way to explore real home cooking.

1177
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,360
It just takes a little thought.

1178
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:24,360
And woman papa is always prepared, aren't you dear?

1179
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:28,360
Double zero, it can't get any lower than that.

1180
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,360
What does that mean?

1181
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:33,360
If it was working, it would mean being for a terrible storm.

1182
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:39,360
I think the reading might be right after all, Mr. Hemmilan.

1183
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:43,360
See the way the sky is darkening.

1184
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,360
Look at those storm clouds.

1185
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,360
We better go before it's too late.

1186
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,360
But there won't be time to get home.

1187
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,360
We'll be shipwrecked, woman papa.

1188
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,360
Surely there's still time.

1189
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:01,360
We don't want to go back to moving valley yet.

1190
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,360
We've only explored half the island.

1191
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:07,360
Besides, you never know what we might find, Snort Maiden.

1192
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:10,360
I wanted to get my hands on those happy fat nurse.

1193
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:13,360
That's the last thing I wanted to do, little mind, the very last.

1194
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,360
I think we ought to leave now.

1195
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,360
What do you think, mama?

1196
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:20,360
Well, you're the captain, dear. It's up to you.

1197
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,360
So I am. Now, let me think.

1198
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,360
Oh.

1199
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,360
Right, we'll stay.

1200
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,360
Oh, can we?

1201
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,360
Yes, but we must put the tent up before it starts raining.

1202
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,360
What tent?

1203
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:58,360
Always be prepared. That's my motto.

1204
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,360
You're very clever to think of everything.

1205
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:05,360
First, we must lower the sails and pull the boat up

1206
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,360
so that she's out of harm's way.

1207
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,360
That should do it.

1208
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:30,360
Well done, everybody. It should be safe here.

1209
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:34,360
Now hurry with the tent, the storm's nearly here.

1210
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,360
Are you all right, Mr. Himulan?

1211
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,360
You stay here and rest.

1212
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:42,360
We'll manage without you.

1213
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,360
I am a bit tired.

1214
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:50,360
You get your breath back first, but don't forget to tie the boat to that tree before you come up.

1215
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:53,360
It looks bad. A real humdinger.

1216
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,360
You can trust me.

1217
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,360
Right, let's get that tent up.

1218
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,360
Oh, dear, what a day.

1219
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,360
Oh, what's this here?

1220
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,360
Oh, yes.

1221
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:30,360
Well, fans, see that I've never seen one of these before.

1222
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,360
Snuffkin?

1223
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:41,360
What's happening?

1224
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:46,360
It's coming really fast. Look at the rain over the sea.

1225
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:48,360
We're going to get soaked if we stay here.

1226
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,360
Just a minute.

1227
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,360
But we'll get wet.

1228
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:55,360
I know, but it's so exciting.

1229
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,360
Things which you have no control over.

1230
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:00,360
You can see this great big storm coming towards you.

1231
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:03,360
And you can't do anything about it.

1232
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,360
No.

1233
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,360
You have to time it just right.

1234
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:12,360
When to make a run for shelter, you mean?

1235
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,360
I knew you'd understand.

1236
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:21,360
I wonder what the Hattie Fatterners are doing.

1237
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,360
Waiting for the thunderstorm.

1238
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,360
Why?

1239
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:27,360
Because they get energy from the electricity and the lightning.

1240
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,360
Really?

1241
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:32,360
That's it. Come on.

1242
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:35,360
I've never seen rain like this.

1243
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:38,360
It'll be over soon enough, Momen.

1244
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:41,360
You're dressed, Mom.

1245
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,360
I know.

1246
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,360
It's all right.

1247
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,360
I'll look for you.

1248
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,360
I know.

1249
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,360
It's all right.

1250
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,360
I'll look for you.

1251
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,360
I'll look for you.

1252
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,360
I'll look for you.

1253
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,360
I'll look for you.

1254
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:00,360
I'll look for you.

1255
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:01,360
I'll look for you.

1256
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,360
All right.

1257
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,360
I'll look after you.

1258
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:59,360
That was a close one.

1259
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,360
Too close.

1260
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:01,660
Too close.

1261
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:04,160
I think it's over, Snork Maiden.

1262
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:08,760
What a find I made today!

1263
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:37,760
If, like the movements and their friends, you're stranded on the desert island in a huge storm, all you can do is wait until it's blown itself out.

1264
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:43,760
But what if the waves are so high that your boat is caught up and washed out to sea?

1265
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,760
That is a different story altogether.

1266
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:21,760
The movements, believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements, they're always happy and always at play.

1267
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:32,760
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements, the movements.

1268
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:50,760
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements, believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements, they're always happy and always at play.

1269
01:32:50,760 --> 01:33:07,760
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements, the movements, the movements.

1270
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:50,760
The movements are having fun day after day, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the

1271
01:33:50,760 --> 01:34:15,380
movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements

1272
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:50,760
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

1273
01:34:50,760 --> 01:35:12,440
bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba I think that Royal

1274
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,780
He's getting loose.

1275
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:15,840
OK, Moonman, you'd better have a look

1276
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,160
before this wind has the whole tent down.

1277
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:18,960
The eye, Captain.

1278
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,640
A sudden storm has hit the hafifat in his island.

1279
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,400
Moonman Papa has decided that it would be far safer

1280
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,520
to stay the night on the island,

1281
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,840
so they put up the tent and moored the boat.

1282
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,840
This will show us what the weather's up to.

1283
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,840
That's as long as it's still working.

1284
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:49,840
I'm sure it's going to die down really soon.

1285
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,840
Oh, wake up, Mr. Hemelon.

1286
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,640
When the storm clears, we must give this barometer

1287
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:56,640
straight back to the hafifat in his.

1288
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:01,640
Oh, I quite fancy keeping it myself to remind me of the island.

1289
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:04,640
You know, it seems to work after all.

1290
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:08,640
But Mr. Hemelon, that'll only work for you.

1291
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,640
What about all the tons of plants you found?

1292
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:13,640
That surely is going to be enough.

1293
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:17,640
Yes, I know, but there was only really one special flower

1294
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:20,640
amongst all those plants, and I nearly missed that one.

1295
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:22,640
Look, isn't it a beauty?

1296
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:25,640
I discovered it as I was about to tie up the boat.

1297
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:28,640
Oh, woman, Papa.

1298
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:30,640
Yes, Mr. Hemelon.

1299
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:33,640
You know, when you all went to put up the tent,

1300
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:36,640
you told me that I was about to tie up the boat.

1301
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,640
So she was safe.

1302
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,640
Yes, of course.

1303
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:43,640
Well, I'm not sure if I did.

1304
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,640
Not sure at all.

1305
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:49,640
Please, try to remember, Mr. Hemelon.

1306
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:50,640
I can't.

1307
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,640
It's all very unpear in my mind.

1308
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:57,640
If the boat's not here, we'll be stuck on the island forever and ever.

1309
01:36:57,640 --> 01:37:01,640
Oh, we pulled it well ashore, so it should be okay.

1310
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:04,640
But we'd better check on it as soon as we can.

1311
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,640
I'll go have a look.

1312
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:07,640
Quickly, moment.

1313
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:09,640
Be careful.

1314
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:10,640
I remember.

1315
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:13,640
I was just going to do it when I spotted this flower.

1316
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:15,640
Just by a rocket was...

1317
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:16,640
Oh, dear.

1318
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:19,640
Woman.

1319
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,640
Woman.

1320
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,640
Boy, that was close.

1321
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:42,640
Tie it to the tree and make sure it's tight.

1322
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:45,640
That should do it.

1323
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:47,640
Just in time.

1324
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:50,640
You know the waves must have been huge to reach this far.

1325
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,640
Well, we saved the boat.

1326
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,640
Yes.

1327
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:58,640
Well, this storm will be over soon.

1328
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:06,640
Is everything okay?

1329
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:08,640
Yep, everything's fine.

1330
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,640
Oh, thank goodness.

1331
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:12,640
So we're not stranded after all.

1332
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:14,640
Huh? No.

1333
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,640
We needn't have worried.

1334
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:18,640
I'm very sorry.

1335
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,640
Really, I am.

1336
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:23,640
Are you alright, Snort Maiden?

1337
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:25,640
Now I am.

1338
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:43,640
According to this, the storm is blowing over now

1339
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:45,640
and it should stop raining soon.

1340
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:47,640
Well, the wind seems to have dropped.

1341
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:51,640
Oh, good. All that thunder and lightning is so noisy.

1342
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:53,640
Ah, right.

1343
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:58,640
I think I'll just go for a bit of a walk before I settle down for the night.

1344
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:01,640
But it's much too dark to see anything.

1345
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:04,640
The fresh air will do me good.

1346
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,640
That's a good idea.

1347
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:11,640
I could do with some fresh air myself.

1348
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:13,640
Wait for me. I'll come too.

1349
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:15,640
Let me in quicker than mine.

1350
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:19,640
There's still there hundreds of them all glowing.

1351
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:21,640
The hatty fat nurse.

1352
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:23,640
They're waiting for us.

1353
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:34,640
The lightning must have recharged them.

1354
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:36,640
Look at them all.

1355
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:39,640
I wonder what they want, Snort Maiden.

1356
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:44,640
Such a heavy storm would have given them lots and lots of energy.

1357
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:46,640
Gosh, they're ready for anything.

1358
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:49,640
They're not coming any closer.

1359
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:51,640
They seem fairly friendly.

1360
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:53,640
Maybe they just want to see what we look like.

1361
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:55,640
No, I know what they're here for.

1362
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:57,640
Oh, what's that, Snuffkin?

1363
01:39:57,640 --> 01:39:59,640
It's their barometer, Moomin Papa.

1364
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:03,640
They know we've got it and they've come to get it back from us.

1365
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:06,640
Yes, I think you're right, Snuffkin.

1366
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,640
Mr. Hamilton?

1367
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:12,640
I do think you'd better give it back to them.

1368
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,640
Do I have to?

1369
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:16,640
Yes, of course.

1370
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:20,640
After all it is there isn't there are a lot of them.

1371
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:24,640
Look, why don't you take it out to them now?

1372
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:32,640
You know the barometer does belong to the Mr. Hamilton.

1373
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,640
Oh, dear, dear.

1374
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:36,640
Give it to me.

1375
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:39,640
Let me do it, Papa.

1376
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:41,640
Well done, my boy.

1377
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:45,640
You must be careful, my dear.

1378
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:47,640
Don't worry, Mama.

1379
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,640
A boy isn't he brave.

1380
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,640
I think this is what you've come for.

1381
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:19,640
Here you are.

1382
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,640
You can have it back now.

1383
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:34,640
Moomin!

1384
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:39,640
Moomin!

1385
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:42,640
Are you all right, Moomin?

1386
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:44,640
I'll tell you something.

1387
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:47,640
I'm real glad there's no electricity where we live.

1388
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:50,640
Oh, they didn't hurt you, did they?

1389
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,640
Ah! Go away!

1390
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:54,640
Leave her alone!

1391
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:57,640
Are you all right, Snorkemaiden?

1392
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,640
What did he do to you?

1393
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:01,640
Just a bit.

1394
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:04,640
Are you all right, Snorkemaiden?

1395
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:05,640
What did he do to you?

1396
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:08,640
Just a bit of shock, that's all.

1397
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:11,640
What's that funny smell?

1398
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:15,640
Oh, my god, it's your hair.

1399
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:16,640
What?

1400
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:19,640
What do you mean?

1401
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:21,640
What's happened to it?

1402
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:22,640
Oh, no, my hair.

1403
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:24,640
Mama, Mama!

1404
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:25,640
Where's your mirror?

1405
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,640
Oh, Mama.

1406
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:30,640
Oh, look at what those wicked, hatty fat nurse have done.

1407
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:34,640
It's here in my handbag somewhere.

1408
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,640
Hurry, Mama!

1409
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:38,640
I must see what's happened to my hair.

1410
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,640
Here you are, dear.

1411
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,640
Look at me!

1412
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:43,640
Look at me!

1413
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:45,640
It's awful!

1414
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:48,640
It's horrible!

1415
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,640
Don't worry, we'll put some magic ointment on

1416
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,640
and it'll come back all lovely and curly.

1417
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:55,640
I don't want nasty curly hair.

1418
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:59,640
I want my long, beautiful hair like it was before.

1419
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:06,640
You know, it really doesn't matter to me, Snort Maiden.

1420
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:16,640
Oh, God, oh, God, I hope that's the last we see of them.

1421
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:20,640
Oh, dear, what's happened to Snort Maiden?

1422
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:27,640
My hair, my hair, where's my hair?

1423
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:54,640
My hair, my hair.

1424
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:24,640
My hair, my hair.

1425
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:53,640
Wake up, woman.

1426
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,640
We've got to hurry.

1427
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:15,640
I wonder where they're going.

1428
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:18,640
Perhaps we're saving a way to a secret island.

1429
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:21,640
Somewhere very far away from here where they can live happily

1430
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:23,640
on their own together.

1431
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:29,640
Gosh, Snort Maiden, they're really weird.

1432
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:32,640
Well, it depends on how you look at it, woman.

1433
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:35,640
They probably think we're a bit strange, too.

1434
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:40,640
Snort Maiden, you're a bit strange, too.

1435
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,640
Snort Maiden, you're really horrible.

1436
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:50,640
You knew I wanted to see them.

1437
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:53,640
Come on, you were fast asleep.

1438
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:54,640
Snoring your head off.

1439
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:57,640
That wasn't me snoring that was Mr. Himulin.

1440
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:58,640
All right.

1441
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:00,640
If you say so.

1442
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:03,640
Well, I hope that's the last I'll see of them.

1443
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:04,640
Me, too.

1444
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:07,640
That's a very pretty scarf, Snort Maiden.

1445
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:09,640
Yes, it is, isn't it?

1446
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:12,640
Can we go exploring, Mama?

1447
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:14,640
I don't see why not.

1448
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:16,640
It looks as though it'll be a nice day

1449
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:20,640
and there'll be lots of exciting things washed up by the storm.

1450
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,640
Oh, that'll be fun.

1451
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:24,640
Let's look for the other side of the island.

1452
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,640
What a good idea.

1453
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:28,640
I might discover some more plants.

1454
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:37,640
Mr. Himulin, hurry up, sir.

1455
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:40,640
Or it will be dark before we get there.

1456
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:42,640
You go on, Momen.

1457
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:45,640
I just want to have a better look at these flowers.

1458
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:48,640
Yes, all right.

1459
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:52,640
Very interesting.

1460
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:58,640
Just think we could find all sorts of things lying on the sand.

1461
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:01,640
I hope it's secret, sunken treasure.

1462
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:03,640
Well, let's hope it's not sunken anymore.

1463
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:05,640
I expect there'll be lots and lots of treasures

1464
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:07,640
from shipwrecks and things like that.

1465
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:10,640
But I find it before you.

1466
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:12,640
Oh, no, you won't.

1467
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:27,640
Look at all this.

1468
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:30,640
I'm going to dive in.

1469
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:34,640
What's that over there?

1470
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:37,640
It's quite shallow right here.

1471
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:40,640
Well, there must be something admit it.

1472
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:42,640
Oh, dear, it's empty.

1473
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:45,640
I think I found something here.

1474
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:51,640
Little lie, little lie.

1475
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:54,640
What's the matter?

1476
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:56,640
Come and see these beautiful shelves I have.

1477
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:58,640
I'm too busy hunting for treasure

1478
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:01,640
to bother with shells.

1479
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:11,640
Hey, what's this?

1480
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:14,640
What?

1481
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:19,640
Oh, look at this one.

1482
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:21,640
I've got a real collection here.

1483
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:24,640
Got a lovely mama's garden.

1484
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:33,640
Wow, watch that.

1485
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:35,640
What?

1486
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:38,640
I can't find any as nice as yours.

1487
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:41,640
Don't be in such an awful hurry, little lie.

1488
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:43,640
Shnark maiden!

1489
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:44,640
Shnark maiden!

1490
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:45,640
Look!

1491
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:47,640
Look what I found.

1492
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:49,640
A proper treasure.

1493
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:51,640
Look!

1494
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:53,640
Whoa!

1495
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:56,640
There's snow inside of it.

1496
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:59,640
I found it in a cave.

1497
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:02,640
What is it?

1498
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,640
What's this?

1499
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,640
It's a ship telescope.

1500
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:08,640
You can see for miles with it.

1501
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,640
I'll give it to Papa.

1502
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:13,640
It's better than anything I got.

1503
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:18,640
Hey, everybody, I found something.

1504
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:20,640
Come on up and have a look.

1505
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:23,640
I wish I could find something interesting.

1506
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:30,640
Have you found some buried treasure?

1507
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:37,640
What a big lady.

1508
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:38,640
Is she dead?

1509
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:40,640
It's made of wood, Snork maiden.

1510
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:43,640
It's a figurehead from a ship.

1511
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:51,640
She's like a queen.

1512
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:55,640
Ha!

1513
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:58,640
She hasn't got any legs, though.

1514
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:02,640
Why don't we put her on the front of our boat?

1515
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:04,640
Nah, it's much too heavy.

1516
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:07,640
It must have come from a ship that was wrecked.

1517
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:09,640
And Sank had seen?

1518
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:12,640
Perhaps it did.

1519
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:15,640
And all hands were lost.

1520
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:18,640
I want to take it home.

1521
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:20,640
What would you do with it?

1522
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:23,640
Use it or frighten people away.

1523
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:31,640
Help! Somebody help me, please!

1524
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:33,640
That's old, Mr. Hamilton.

1525
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:36,640
Gosh, I hope it's not more haddy fattiners.

1526
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:38,640
Someone help, please!

1527
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:40,640
We're coming!

1528
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:49,640
Woman, why do you like this old figurehead so much?

1529
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:51,640
You're staring at her.

1530
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:53,640
She's not all that special, you know?

1531
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:55,640
Yes, I know.

1532
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:56,640
She's not even real.

1533
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:58,640
Only made of wood.

1534
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:03,640
Do you like her eyes?

1535
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:05,640
Or is it her hair?

1536
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:08,640
Just because I haven't got any?

1537
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:10,640
Nearly there, just a bit further.

1538
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:12,640
Come on, snuffed it for you.

1539
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:15,640
You're very heavy, Mr. Hamilton.

1540
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:17,640
Oh, thank you, Snuffed Kid.

1541
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:19,640
You saved my life.

1542
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:21,640
Oh!

1543
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:24,640
Boy, how'd you end up there, Mr. Hamilton?

1544
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:26,640
One minute, I was looking for plants.

1545
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:29,640
The next I'd fall and ride into that hole.

1546
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:32,640
I think you'd be safe for collecting stamps, Mr. Hamilton.

1547
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:34,640
Oh, no, it's not.

1548
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:36,640
It's not.

1549
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:38,640
It's not.

1550
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:41,640
You'd be safe for collecting stamps, Mr. Hamilton.

1551
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:43,640
Oh, no, it's not here.

1552
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:45,640
Where is it?

1553
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:48,640
What is it now?

1554
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:50,640
Tell me.

1555
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:52,640
Make a move and preserve me.

1556
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:54,640
Calm down, Mr. Hamilton.

1557
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:56,640
Tell me what's the matter?

1558
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:58,640
My sample box, my sample box.

1559
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:00,640
Oh, my goodness.

1560
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:03,640
You didn't leave it in the hole, did you?

1561
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:05,640
Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

1562
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:07,640
Oh, dear.

1563
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:08,640
Oh, she's samples.

1564
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:09,640
I'm so silly.

1565
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:11,640
Oh, Snuffed Kid.

1566
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:14,640
Oh.

1567
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:16,640
Oh, Snuffed Kid, would you mind?

1568
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,640
Okay.

1569
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:18,640
Anything for some peace.

1570
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:21,640
Oh, dear boy, you are wonderful.

1571
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:24,640
You shall have one of my rarest plants as a reward.

1572
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:25,640
Indeed, you shall.

1573
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:27,640
I shall choose a magnificent one for you.

1574
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:29,640
Thank you very much, Mr. Hamilton.

1575
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:32,640
Gosh, your one-word movement is.

1576
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:36,640
Oh, there you are.

1577
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:37,640
What have you been up to?

1578
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:41,640
He can't take his eyes off that silly wooden lady.

1579
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:43,640
He just dares at her.

1580
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:44,640
Really?

1581
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:45,640
I do not.

1582
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:48,640
I just think she has a very beautiful face.

1583
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:52,640
Well, Moomin, now that you're here, I could really do with your help.

1584
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:54,640
What do you want, Snuffed Kid?

1585
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:58,640
Mr. Hamilton dropped his box of samples down this hole and I'm going to try and get it.

1586
01:52:58,640 --> 01:52:59,640
I didn't drop it.

1587
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:03,640
I fell in the hole and just forgot it when Snuffed can pull me out.

1588
01:53:03,640 --> 01:53:05,640
You're a bit absent-minded, Mr. Hamilton.

1589
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:06,640
No, I'm not.

1590
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:10,640
I can remember every Latin name of every single plant, you know.

1591
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:12,640
Okay, I'll go down, Moomin.

1592
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:14,640
But you'll have to help me get back up.

1593
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:15,640
Okay.

1594
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:17,640
I'll help you too.

1595
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:18,640
Now be careful.

1596
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:20,640
Can you see it yet, Snuffed Kid?

1597
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,640
I'm not down at the bottom yet.

1598
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:23,640
Oh, forgive me.

1599
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:24,640
I'm sorry.

1600
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:25,640
I found it.

1601
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:27,640
Wonderful.

1602
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:30,640
Tell me, are the plants all right?

1603
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:32,640
You can check them yourself in a minute.

1604
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:37,640
Oh.

1605
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:41,640
Are you all right, Snuffed Kid?

1606
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:42,640
Wait a minute.

1607
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:44,640
I found something else.

1608
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:47,640
Oh, look.

1609
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:49,640
There's the boat.

1610
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:51,640
It's Moomin, Moomin, Papa.

1611
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,640
Hello.

1612
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:00,640
It's gold.

1613
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:01,640
Hello.

1614
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:03,640
We've been hunting treasure.

1615
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:09,640
Go and get Moomin, Papa. I found gold.

1616
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:12,640
Boy, oh boy, I wonder how much there is.

1617
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:14,640
Moomin, Papa, we'll know.

1618
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:27,640
Well, Moomin, Papa, what should we do with all this beautiful gold?

1619
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:30,640
It would look lovely in the garden, don't you think?

1620
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:33,640
With all the shells that the snork made and found,

1621
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:35,640
they'll look good in amongst the roses.

1622
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:37,640
What do you think, Mama?

1623
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:39,640
I'm sure they will, Papa.

1624
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:40,640
I'm sure they will.

1625
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:48,640
Moomin, she's only a stupid, legless doll.

1626
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:52,640
You can have my bowl full of snowsknot, Maiden.

1627
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,640
No, thanks.

1628
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:55,640
Well, I'll look after it for you.

1629
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:57,640
I can pretend it's my treasure.

1630
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:58,640
Oh.

1631
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:08,640
And that was the end of their first adventure in the new boat.

1632
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:13,640
Moomin, Papa, decided that it was much more fun to set off without maps and sea charts.

1633
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:16,640
You never know where you might end up.

1634
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:28,640
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

1635
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:35,640
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1636
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:39,640
They're always happy and always at play.

1637
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:43,640
The movements are having fun day after day.

1638
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:46,640
The movements.

1639
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:50,640
The movements.

1640
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:57,640
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

1641
01:55:57,640 --> 01:56:04,640
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1642
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:09,640
They're always happy and always at play.

1643
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:12,640
The movements are having fun day after day.

1644
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:16,640
The movements.

1645
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:20,640
The movements.

1646
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:26,640
The movements.

1647
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:48,640
Here they are for one and all.

1648
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:51,640
The movements are about to come.

1649
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:54,640
Come on and sit down here with me.

1650
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:56,640
They're here for you on your TV.

1651
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:59,640
They are the movements.

1652
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:02,640
They are the movements.

1653
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:05,640
So come with me, give me your hand.

1654
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:08,640
I'll take you up to a moment land.

1655
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:11,640
You can fly just like a bird.

1656
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:13,640
Sing that song ever.

1657
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:16,640
There were the movements.

1658
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:19,640
There were the movements.

1659
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:22,640
There were the movements.

1660
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:25,640
There were the movements.

1661
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:29,640
There were the movements.

1662
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:04,640
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

1663
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:18,640
Now it's very nice to get letters

1664
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:20,640
at least every now and then

1665
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:25,640
however in Moomin Valley they're rarely sent or received

1666
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:28,640
and yet they do have letterboxes

1667
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:30,640
and even postman

1668
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:38,640
Oho! Moomin!

1669
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:43,640
Hello! Is that for me?

1670
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:50,640
A letter for the Moomin!

1671
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:53,640
He's gonna fall in this time!

1672
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:54,640
What?

1673
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:57,640
Come on, this way, towards me, come on!

1674
01:58:58,640 --> 01:58:59,640
Come on!

1675
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:02,640
Oh! I got him!

1676
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:04,640
Did you dig that hole?

1677
01:59:04,640 --> 01:59:06,640
Yeah, no work, didn't it?

1678
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:10,640
All right, who's responsible for this?

1679
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:12,640
Are you all right?

1680
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:15,640
Did you dig this hole, young Moomin?

1681
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:16,640
Of course not!

1682
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:18,640
Who was it then?

1683
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:21,640
I knew I should have known!

1684
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:23,640
Come here, you just wait!

1685
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:25,640
Uh, hold on, Mr. Postman!

1686
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:27,640
Can I help my letter, please?

1687
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:29,640
Just do wait!

1688
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:51,640
Here's the letter, Mama!

1689
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:55,640
Hmm?

1690
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:57,640
A goodness, a letter!

1691
01:59:57,640 --> 01:59:59,640
I think it's from Mumble!

1692
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:01,640
Oh, really?

1693
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:03,640
Where's Little Mai, Moomin?

1694
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:05,640
Well, she's um...

1695
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:08,640
So, who's this letter from?

1696
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:10,640
It's from my sister Mumble, isn't it?

1697
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:12,640
Oh, should I know?

1698
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:14,640
She went on holiday to get away from me!

1699
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:17,640
I bet she's coming back because she's missed all the fun!

1700
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:20,640
She'd stay away if she had at least sensed!

1701
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:23,640
This is the third time I've fallen into a hole!

1702
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:28,640
Yes, I know, but this is only the first time I've seen you do it!

1703
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:31,640
What a horrible little child you are!

1704
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:33,640
Archie!

1705
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:34,640
Whoop!

1706
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:35,640
That was close!

1707
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:37,640
Go on, follow us!

1708
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:38,640
Whoop!

1709
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:40,640
Whoop!

1710
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:41,640
Whoop!

1711
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:44,640
Come here, wait till I get my hands on you!

1712
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:47,640
Mumble says that she's coming back!

1713
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:50,640
She feels that she's ready to cope with Little Mai again!

1714
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:52,640
Oh, that's good news, Moomin, Mama!

1715
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:55,640
I think that we should go and give her house a good clean!

1716
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:58,640
Have you told Little Mai now Mumble's coming?

1717
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:00,640
She'll be able to go home!

1718
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:04,640
No, I expect the postman is still chasing her around the garden!

1719
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:07,640
Don't tell me why I don't want to know!

1720
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:10,640
Mama!

1721
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:11,640
Mama!

1722
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:13,640
Is the letter from Mumble?

1723
02:01:13,640 --> 02:01:15,640
What does she have to say?

1724
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:17,640
Is she coming home?

1725
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:24,640
And a few days later, Mumble returned to Moomin Valley.

1726
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:30,640
Now Mumble is a lot bigger and prettier than Little Mai,

1727
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:33,640
and what's more, she's a lot quieter.

1728
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:38,640
That's Moomin Valley, over there!

1729
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:41,640
It's not full of creepy crawlies, is it?

1730
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:43,640
Not as far as I know!

1731
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:46,640
Is there a house over there?

1732
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:48,640
Maybe there have food, let's go!

1733
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:50,640
Oh, that's Moomin House!

1734
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:58,640
Are you going to Moomin Valley, too?

1735
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:02,640
Yes, we thought we would!

1736
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:04,640
That's nice, so am I!

1737
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:06,640
We can go together!

1738
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:09,640
Your suitcase looks very heavy!

1739
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:11,640
Would you like a hand with me?

1740
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:15,640
Okay!

1741
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:18,640
Are they nice to people that live in that house?

1742
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:20,640
Yes, they are!

1743
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:22,640
Can we stay there?

1744
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:23,640
I'm sure you can!

1745
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:25,640
My little sister is staying with them!

1746
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:27,640
Follow me, I know the way!

1747
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:28,640
Shall we go?

1748
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:35,640
What's the matter?

1749
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:37,640
Nothing! We're following you!

1750
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:39,640
All right!

1751
02:02:46,640 --> 02:02:48,640
Mumbo!

1752
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:54,640
Hello, how are you?

1753
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:55,640
Fine, you!

1754
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:56,640
Fine!

1755
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:58,640
Do you have a nice rest without me?

1756
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:00,640
Come on, everybody's waiting to see you!

1757
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:06,640
Oh, by the way, I'm at two very small strangers who said they were coming here!

1758
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:09,640
Coming here, Mumbo?

1759
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:13,640
Yes, they're about the same size as Little Mai!

1760
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:17,640
Both a bit odd and they're carrying a very large suitcase!

1761
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:21,640
Right, I'd better make them up a small double bed then!

1762
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:23,640
Thanks for the tea!

1763
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:26,640
Now, are you ready to come home with me now, Little Mai?

1764
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:28,640
No, not yet!

1765
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:30,640
We've got to go home and tidy the house!

1766
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:32,640
It hasn't been aired for the whole winter!

1767
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:34,640
It's all right, Mumbo!

1768
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:39,640
I cleaned and swept the floors the other day and opened all the doors and windows!

1769
02:03:39,640 --> 02:03:41,640
Thank you very much!

1770
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:46,640
It must have been a relief to be asleep most of the time with Little Mai's been staying with you!

1771
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:49,640
They said they haven't been bored once since we woke up!

1772
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:51,640
And we've had a really good time together!

1773
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:53,640
Isn't that right, Mumbo?

1774
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:58,640
Bye now!

1775
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:02,640
Well, well!

1776
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:04,640
There's well, well me, Papa!

1777
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:08,640
Just that I might be able to hear myself think again now!

1778
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:10,640
I know what you mean!

1779
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:18,640
You're not, thingamy!

1780
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:20,640
No, it's your turn to be great!

1781
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:22,640
What if they scream when they see us?

1782
02:04:22,640 --> 02:04:25,640
But the lady told us they would friendly thingamy!

1783
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:34,640
Go on, do it!

1784
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:40,640
Excuse me?

1785
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:54,640
Now, what's the matter with you, too?

1786
02:04:54,640 --> 02:04:57,640
Don't forget your suitcase, will you?

1787
02:04:58,640 --> 02:05:00,640
What can we do?

1788
02:05:00,640 --> 02:05:04,640
It's all right, don't be frightened, I won't eat you!

1789
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:08,640
I'm the police inspector here, been in the valley for years!

1790
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:10,640
Police!

1791
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:11,640
Oh no!

1792
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:13,640
We're not thieves!

1793
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:15,640
I'm all in the same day!

1794
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:17,640
I'm all in the same day!

1795
02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:20,640
Well, nobody said that you did!

1796
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:23,640
Then you haven't come to arrest us!

1797
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:24,640
Have you?

1798
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:26,640
Of course I haven't!

1799
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:28,640
I've come to see the movement family!

1800
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:34,640
It is ours, suitcase!

1801
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:35,640
It is!

1802
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:37,640
Of course it is!

1803
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:39,640
Now, have you come to see the movements, too?

1804
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:42,640
Hello?

1805
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:47,640
Oh, there you are, I thought it was you!

1806
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:52,640
Are you expecting these two guests, movement mama?

1807
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:54,640
I think so!

1808
02:05:54,640 --> 02:05:57,640
And they've got a suitcase, so they must be staying!

1809
02:05:57,640 --> 02:05:58,640
That's nice!

1810
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:00,640
You will stay, won't you?

1811
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:02,640
Is it all right with you?

1812
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:04,640
Of course it is!

1813
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:06,640
I'm movement mama!

1814
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:09,640
I'm thingany, and this is my friend Bob, movement mama!

1815
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:10,640
You're welcome!

1816
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:13,640
Come in and make yourselves at home!

1817
02:06:13,640 --> 02:06:16,640
I think it'll be okay, thingany.

1818
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:20,640
Careful!

1819
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:21,640
Hi!

1820
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:26,640
They are a bit strange, aren't they?

1821
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:28,640
Yes, definitely!

1822
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:30,640
So, what can I do for you today, Inspector?

1823
02:06:30,640 --> 02:06:35,640
Oh, well, I heard that mumble was back from holiday, so...

1824
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:37,640
Yes, that's right!

1825
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:38,640
Oh!

1826
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:40,640
Are you here now?

1827
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:44,640
No inspector, I'm afraid she's gone home with little Mai!

1828
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:45,640
Oh, right!

1829
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:48,640
I have to keep an eye on things, you know?

1830
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:49,640
Very important!

1831
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:52,640
Who goes away? Who comes back?

1832
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:58,640
Well, I'll say goodbye then, movement mama!

1833
02:07:00,640 --> 02:07:03,640
I do believe he's fallen for mumble!

1834
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:05,640
But has she fallen for him?

1835
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:06,640
I wonder!

1836
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:07,640
What are the new guests doing?

1837
02:07:07,640 --> 02:07:09,640
Looking scared mostly!

1838
02:07:09,640 --> 02:07:11,640
Who one...

1839
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:12,640
Do one...

1840
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:14,640
Do one...

1841
02:07:19,640 --> 02:07:21,640
Do one...

1842
02:07:30,640 --> 02:07:31,640
Here you are!

1843
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:33,640
I've emptied these drawers for you!

1844
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:34,640
There should be enough room!

1845
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:36,640
Thank you, movement!

1846
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:45,640
Where should we put this suitcase?

1847
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:47,640
Let's see!

1848
02:07:48,640 --> 02:07:50,640
In this drawer?

1849
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:55,640
It's a good place to hide, too!

1850
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:57,640
Oh, look at this!

1851
02:07:57,640 --> 02:07:59,640
It made such a pretty bad voice!

1852
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:01,640
I like the movements!

1853
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:03,640
They didn't scream at all!

1854
02:08:07,640 --> 02:08:09,640
You still gotta be careful, though!

1855
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:22,640
We've had some very strange people staying at our house,

1856
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:25,640
but I think these two are really weird!

1857
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:27,640
Well, they're Northerners!

1858
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:30,640
I guess so, with names like Thingamy and Bob!

1859
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:32,640
And that suitcase?

1860
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:36,640
They look a lot like fugitives to me, Snuffkin!

1861
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:39,640
And perhaps they're dangerous criminals on the run?

1862
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:41,640
Do you want to see them?

1863
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:44,640
Yeah, I wouldn't mind, movement!

1864
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,640
Ah!

1865
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:13,640
Ah, there you are!

1866
02:09:13,640 --> 02:09:15,640
What are they doing now?

1867
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:16,640
No idea!

1868
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:20,640
I couldn't hear anything, so they must be asleep!

1869
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:22,640
We think they're fugitives, movement, Papa!

1870
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:24,640
They're probably on the run from the law!

1871
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:28,640
Well, they are a bit funny about their suitcase!

1872
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:30,640
Gold coins!

1873
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:32,640
Stolen state secrets!

1874
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:33,640
Arsonists!

1875
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:36,640
We better hide all the matches, Papa!

1876
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:38,640
Public enemies, numbers one and two,

1877
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:41,640
but they don't look like it, though!

1878
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:43,640
How about some tea?

1879
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:44,640
Snuffkin? Smith?

1880
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:45,640
Yes, please!

1881
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:47,640
Any cakes as well?

1882
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:10,640
Thingamy?

1883
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:16,640
Oh!

1884
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:20,640
Oh no!

1885
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:22,640
This suitcase is gone, too!

1886
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:23,640
What am I going to do?

1887
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:24,640
Oh!

1888
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:26,640
What am I going to do?

1889
02:10:26,640 --> 02:10:28,640
What am I going to do?

1890
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:29,640
You wake already?

1891
02:10:29,640 --> 02:10:30,640
Oh!

1892
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:33,640
What a nerfie you're doing under the bed!

1893
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:35,640
It's the safest place!

1894
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:37,640
Something's about to happen, though!

1895
02:10:37,640 --> 02:10:38,640
Ah!

1896
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:39,640
I can feel her coming!

1897
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:41,640
That's what woke me up!

1898
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:42,640
Don't be silly!

1899
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:43,640
She can't know we're here!

1900
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:44,640
Yeah!

1901
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:45,640
She can!

1902
02:10:45,640 --> 02:10:47,640
And I know she'll be here to hide!

1903
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:58,640
Well, it's very windy tonight, moment!

1904
02:10:58,640 --> 02:11:00,640
Well, chilly, too!

1905
02:11:00,640 --> 02:11:01,640
Don't you think?

1906
02:11:01,640 --> 02:11:04,640
Oh, hello!

1907
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:09,640
Did you sleep well?

1908
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:11,640
Would you like some tea?

1909
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:13,640
Hey, so that's them!

1910
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:14,640
Don't worry!

1911
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:16,640
These are good friends of mine!

1912
02:11:16,640 --> 02:11:17,640
Let me introduce you!

1913
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:19,640
Sniff and Snuffkin!

1914
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:23,640
And what's the matter?

1915
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:28,640
She's coming!

1916
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,640
Yes, she is!

1917
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:32,640
Well, who is my dear?

1918
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:33,640
The girl!

1919
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:34,640
The girl!

1920
02:11:34,640 --> 02:11:36,640
Yes, she's terrible!

1921
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:37,640
Who?

1922
02:11:38,640 --> 02:11:40,640
Oh, you know who she is?

1923
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:42,640
Yes, I've never seen her!

1924
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:44,640
But I've heard she's a scary monster, all right?

1925
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:45,640
Scary monster?

1926
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:47,640
And this, uh, grope is after you!

1927
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:49,640
Yes, she is!

1928
02:12:02,640 --> 02:12:03,640
Now, don't you worry!

1929
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:06,640
She'll think twice before she tangles with me!

1930
02:12:06,640 --> 02:12:07,640
Well, see?

1931
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:09,640
If she's a scary monster!

1932
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:11,640
Monster or not?

1933
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:14,640
If you're a guest in Moomin House, nothing will harm you!

1934
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:15,640
Right, everyone!

1935
02:12:15,640 --> 02:12:18,640
Lock all the doors and you two go to your room!

1936
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:20,640
Thank you, Moomin Papa!

1937
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:22,640
Nobody is going to get in here!

1938
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:24,640
Well said!

1939
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:27,640
To Am's family, to Am's!

1940
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:30,640
Ready for more tea, anyone?

1941
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:34,640
What's the matter?

1942
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:37,640
We're going to be attacked by a huge scary monster!

1943
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:38,640
Heavens!

1944
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:41,640
You'd better get the frying pan, Mama!

1945
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:43,640
Oh dear!

1946
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:51,640
All right, has everyone got a weapon?

1947
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:07,640
Alright, now, let's finish the list before we go!

1948
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:29,640
What?

1949
02:13:34,640 --> 02:13:36,640
Well, it's midnight.

1950
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:39,640
I don't believe in that stupid grog.

1951
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:41,640
I hope you're right.

1952
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:51,640
She's coming! She's here!

1953
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:53,640
Yes, she's very close now.

1954
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:07,640
I'm going home.

1955
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:10,640
This is silly.

1956
02:14:10,640 --> 02:14:12,640
We can't wait up all night.

1957
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:14,640
Besides, I'm getting very sleepy.

1958
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:16,640
It's up to you.

1959
02:14:16,640 --> 02:14:18,640
Right. I'm going, man. Mom and Papa.

1960
02:14:18,640 --> 02:14:19,640
Watch your back.

1961
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:23,640
Yes. Keep in the open.

1962
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:26,640
You guys are only trying to frighten me.

1963
02:14:28,640 --> 02:14:29,640
Well, it won't work.

1964
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:36,640
She's here.

1965
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:38,640
No, she's not.

1966
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:40,640
There are no such things as monsters.

1967
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:43,640
Just a trap blowing a candle, though.

1968
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:55,640
You see? There's nobody there.

1969
02:14:56,640 --> 02:15:00,640
Well, in that case, there's nothing to stop you going home, Sniff.

1970
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:07,640
Do you think I'm scared?

1971
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:08,640
You're making it up.

1972
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:09,640
Come on, admit it.

1973
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:10,640
There aren't any grog.

1974
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:13,640
Not at all.

1975
02:15:28,640 --> 02:15:30,640
You see? There's no one here at all.

1976
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:35,640
Oh.

1977
02:15:49,640 --> 02:15:52,640
Oh, be careful. Watch what you're doing.

1978
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:54,640
It's here. It's here.

1979
02:15:54,640 --> 02:15:55,640
Where?

1980
02:15:55,640 --> 02:15:59,640
Right outside that door. Big and black and horrible.

1981
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:00,640
Right.

1982
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:05,640
No, don't open it. You'll get in.

1983
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:08,640
Come on, everybody.

1984
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:16,640
Well, there's nobody here, Sniff.

1985
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:17,640
Are you sure?

1986
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:25,640
I can't see anything.

1987
02:16:26,640 --> 02:16:30,640
Well, I must have scared that silly old grog away, moment.

1988
02:16:31,640 --> 02:16:34,640
That will teach her to come sniffing around here, all right?

1989
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:36,640
No, that she is.

1990
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:53,640
Mm-hmm. Mrs. Groke, we'd like you to go home.

1991
02:16:53,640 --> 02:16:55,640
Now, you just go on.

1992
02:16:57,640 --> 02:16:59,640
You're upsetting our guests.

1993
02:16:59,640 --> 02:17:01,640
And you're freezing my roses.

1994
02:17:01,640 --> 02:17:03,640
Yes, you've been bullied.

1995
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:07,640
I'm sorry, but you really must leave.

1996
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:09,640
Please go before I count to ten.

1997
02:17:09,640 --> 02:17:22,640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine and a half.

1998
02:17:24,640 --> 02:17:26,640
All right.

1999
02:17:47,640 --> 02:17:50,640
All right.

2000
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:52,640
Hey.

2001
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:54,640
What?

2002
02:17:55,640 --> 02:17:57,640
Hey, are you all right, moment?

2003
02:17:57,640 --> 02:17:59,640
Look at the ground.

2004
02:18:01,640 --> 02:18:03,640
It's all frozen.

2005
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:16,640
That's a Groke's voice.

2006
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:18,640
It's cold.

2007
02:18:18,640 --> 02:18:19,640
Isn't it?

2008
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:21,640
I don't think she'll be back tonight.

2009
02:18:21,640 --> 02:18:24,640
Let's all go in and have a hot drink.

2010
02:18:25,640 --> 02:18:28,640
The Groke didn't come back that night.

2011
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:31,640
But what did she want in movement house?

2012
02:18:31,640 --> 02:18:38,640
And will she return perhaps another night when they're all asleep?

2013
02:18:39,640 --> 02:18:45,640
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

2014
02:18:46,640 --> 02:18:53,640
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2015
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:57,640
They're always happy and always at play.

2016
02:18:57,640 --> 02:19:01,640
The movements are having fun day after day.

2017
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:04,640
The movements.

2018
02:19:04,640 --> 02:19:08,640
The movements.

2019
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:14,640
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

2020
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:22,640
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2021
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:26,640
They're always happy and always at play.

2022
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:30,640
The movements are having fun day after day.

2023
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:33,640
The movements.

2024
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:37,640
The movements.

2025
02:19:37,640 --> 02:19:44,640
The movements.

2026
02:19:44,640 --> 02:19:51,640
The movements.

2027
02:19:51,640 --> 02:19:57,640
The movements.

2028
02:19:57,640 --> 02:20:03,640
The movements.

2029
02:20:03,640 --> 02:20:09,640
The movements.

2030
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:12,640
The movements.

2031
02:20:12,640 --> 02:20:15,640
They're for you on your TV.

2032
02:20:15,640 --> 02:20:18,640
They are the movements.

2033
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:21,640
They are the movements.

2034
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:24,640
So come with me, give me your hand.

2035
02:20:24,640 --> 02:20:27,640
I'll take you up to a moment land.

2036
02:20:27,640 --> 02:20:30,640
You can fly just like a bird.

2037
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:33,640
Sing that song ever.

2038
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:36,640
There were the movements.

2039
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:39,640
There were the movements.

2040
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:42,640
There were the movements.

2041
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:45,640
There were the movements.

2042
02:20:45,640 --> 02:20:49,640
There were the movements.

2043
02:21:09,640 --> 02:21:19,640
There were the movements.

2044
02:21:19,640 --> 02:21:23,640
There were the movements.

2045
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:44,640
With all the excitement of that night,

2046
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:49,640
Sniff decided not to go home and was sharing movement's bed.

2047
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:53,640
Snuffkin, as always, preferred to sleep in his tent.

2048
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:55,640
You remember what happened?

2049
02:21:55,640 --> 02:22:01,640
The horrible grok coming after thingamy and bob and everything freezing?

2050
02:22:01,640 --> 02:22:08,640
For a moment, however, the night wasn't quite over yet.

2051
02:22:09,640 --> 02:22:13,640
Mommy, papa, help me.

2052
02:22:13,640 --> 02:22:18,640
The grok is after me.

2053
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:26,640
I can't run anymore.

2054
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:31,640
I can't run anymore.

2055
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:52,640
Why am I on the floor?

2056
02:22:52,640 --> 02:22:55,640
Sniff?

2057
02:22:57,640 --> 02:23:01,640
Good morning, mama.

2058
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:03,640
Good morning, moving.

2059
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:04,640
Is Sniff up yet?

2060
02:23:04,640 --> 02:23:06,640
You're joking.

2061
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:08,640
Where's the thingamy and bob?

2062
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:10,640
They haven't stirred yet.

2063
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:15,640
The poor things are tired out.

2064
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:17,640
Papa's not still asleep, is he?

2065
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:22,640
No, he's looking at my rose bushes.

2066
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:24,640
Are they okay, papa?

2067
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:27,640
No, frozen to death and look.

2068
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:28,640
What?

2069
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:35,640
That's where she was standing over there where the grass is dead.

2070
02:23:35,640 --> 02:23:38,640
She must have been real cold to freeze the roses.

2071
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:40,640
What a shame. They were very pretty.

2072
02:23:40,640 --> 02:23:42,640
There's not much left of them now.

2073
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:45,640
We'll have to grow some new ones.

2074
02:23:45,640 --> 02:23:48,640
I dreamed that she was chasing me, papa.

2075
02:23:48,640 --> 02:23:49,640
Oh, don't worry, moment.

2076
02:23:49,640 --> 02:23:52,640
I think she's only after thingamy and bob.

2077
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:55,640
So they're not fugitives from justice after all?

2078
02:23:55,640 --> 02:23:59,640
I have a feeling that they would prefer that moment.

2079
02:24:07,640 --> 02:24:09,640
Aren't thingamy and bob coming down?

2080
02:24:09,640 --> 02:24:12,640
Yes, if they could have breakfast in their room if you didn't mind.

2081
02:24:12,640 --> 02:24:14,640
Well, what did they tell you?

2082
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:15,640
What?

2083
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:17,640
About why the groke is chasing them.

2084
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:22,640
Oh, they just looked terrified and wouldn't say anything about her at all.

2085
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:25,640
You know, we really ought to find out why.

2086
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:27,640
Yes, you're right.

2087
02:24:27,640 --> 02:24:31,640
Mom and mom, why don't you take their breakfast up and see if they'll tell you anything

2088
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:34,640
if any of us can get it out of the mucan?

2089
02:24:47,640 --> 02:24:49,640
Who's that?

2090
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:52,640
It's only me. I've brought you both a nice breakfast.

2091
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:13,640
Well, what did they say?

2092
02:25:13,640 --> 02:25:16,640
It seems that the groke is after the suitcase.

2093
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:17,640
Not them.

2094
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:21,640
I wonder what's in it, perhaps they've stolen her mummy as well.

2095
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:25,640
And they also said that it did use to belong to her.

2096
02:25:25,640 --> 02:25:28,640
Oh, dear, if they've stolen it.

2097
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:30,640
I don't know about that.

2098
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:34,640
I asked them how they got it, but they wouldn't say another word.

2099
02:25:34,640 --> 02:25:35,640
Well, this is too much.

2100
02:25:35,640 --> 02:25:37,640
We could be harboring criminals.

2101
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:41,640
I know they don't look like it, but you never know, do you?

2102
02:25:41,640 --> 02:25:43,640
You can ask the groke.

2103
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:45,640
Shh, don't shout.

2104
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:50,640
No, that's no good. We don't want to come back here most definitely.

2105
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:53,640
Let's ask the police inspector to question them.

2106
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:55,640
We don't want to get the police involved.

2107
02:25:55,640 --> 02:25:57,640
Well, you'll suggest something, Anne.

2108
02:25:57,640 --> 02:25:59,640
Quit shouting, sniff.

2109
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:06,640
Look, why don't you just wait for them to tell you a moment?

2110
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:11,640
I know it seems strange, but I've noticed that if you pretend not to be interested,

2111
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:13,640
people can't wait to tell you their secrets.

2112
02:26:13,640 --> 02:26:17,640
They told Mama about the suitcase, but they wouldn't say anything to Papa.

2113
02:26:17,640 --> 02:26:19,640
You know something, Moomin?

2114
02:26:19,640 --> 02:26:21,640
They might open up to Snark Maiden.

2115
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:23,640
She's someone more their own age.

2116
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:25,640
You could be right.

2117
02:26:29,640 --> 02:26:31,640
Hey, Snark Maiden.

2118
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:32,640
Where are you going?

2119
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:34,640
Moomin house.

2120
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:35,640
I'll come with you.

2121
02:26:35,640 --> 02:26:38,640
But I thought you were living there.

2122
02:26:38,640 --> 02:26:40,640
I was until Mumble came back yesterday.

2123
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:42,640
How is she?

2124
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:45,640
She's not bossy, and she snores too.

2125
02:26:45,640 --> 02:26:47,640
Moomin.

2126
02:26:47,640 --> 02:26:48,640
Snark Maiden.

2127
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:50,640
Where are you off to?

2128
02:26:50,640 --> 02:26:52,640
Well, I was just on my way to see you.

2129
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:56,640
Oh, that's so nice, and I've come to see you, Moomin.

2130
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:59,640
I brought you a little present, Moomin.

2131
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:01,640
A present for me.

2132
02:27:01,640 --> 02:27:03,640
Yes, and it's very beautiful.

2133
02:27:03,640 --> 02:27:04,640
What is it?

2134
02:27:04,640 --> 02:27:06,640
Something you must never break or lose.

2135
02:27:06,640 --> 02:27:08,640
I promise I won't.

2136
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:09,640
There you are.

2137
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:10,640
Thank you.

2138
02:27:10,640 --> 02:27:12,640
Come on, open it.

2139
02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:19,640
A lot of beautiful shell.

2140
02:27:19,640 --> 02:27:23,640
I spent all of yesterday on the beach searching for it just for you.

2141
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:25,640
Look, we can see ourselves in it.

2142
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:26,640
So we can.

2143
02:27:26,640 --> 02:27:28,640
Thank you very much, Snark Maiden.

2144
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:31,640
It's my heart, and I want you to look after her.

2145
02:27:31,640 --> 02:27:33,640
Oh, I will, Snark Maiden.

2146
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:34,640
I will.

2147
02:27:34,640 --> 02:27:36,640
I'll think of you whenever I look at it.

2148
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:37,640
I'm Moomin.

2149
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:43,640
I promise you that I'll always kiss the shell before I go to sleep.

2150
02:27:43,640 --> 02:27:46,640
It will be my most precious treasure.

2151
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:49,640
Apart from me?

2152
02:27:49,640 --> 02:27:51,640
So what shall I do?

2153
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:53,640
Take them for a walk?

2154
02:27:53,640 --> 02:27:56,640
Yes, but take your time and don't rush them.

2155
02:27:56,640 --> 02:27:58,640
I'll let them cry on my shoulder.

2156
02:27:58,640 --> 02:28:00,640
Yes, and try and talk to them as well, though.

2157
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:04,640
I feel very important and a little bit nervous, too.

2158
02:28:04,640 --> 02:28:06,640
Have some tea first.

2159
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:09,640
Thank you, Moomin, Mama.

2160
02:28:19,640 --> 02:28:21,640
We don't need your help, little Mai.

2161
02:28:21,640 --> 02:28:22,640
Ah, that's what you think.

2162
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:24,640
I'd be able to weedle out their secrets.

2163
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:26,640
It's not an interrogation.

2164
02:28:26,640 --> 02:28:28,640
We only want to talk to them, you know.

2165
02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:30,640
So you can weedle out their secrets.

2166
02:28:30,640 --> 02:28:31,640
I'll be very quiet.

2167
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:35,640
Little Mai, have you ever managed to be very quiet?

2168
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:38,640
Not really, but there's only one way to find out.

2169
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:40,640
You must let me go with Snork Maiden.

2170
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:45,640
No, this situation needs a tender understanding, Moomin.

2171
02:28:45,640 --> 02:28:48,640
That's me, exactly.

2172
02:28:48,640 --> 02:28:49,640
You ready?

2173
02:28:49,640 --> 02:28:51,640
I suppose so.

2174
02:28:51,640 --> 02:28:52,640
Hello, it's Moomin.

2175
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:56,640
Can I talk to you for a minute?

2176
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:59,640
Hello?

2177
02:28:59,640 --> 02:29:01,640
This is Snork Maiden.

2178
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:03,640
She's a very good friend of mine.

2179
02:29:03,640 --> 02:29:06,640
Hello, I'm very happy to meet you both.

2180
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:08,640
She's very tender and understanding,

2181
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:10,640
and she'd like to talk to you.

2182
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:13,640
Can she come in?

2183
02:29:13,640 --> 02:29:18,640
Well, if she has to, Moomin.

2184
02:29:18,640 --> 02:29:22,640
Come in, Mai.

2185
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:27,640
You pee, you pee, you pee.

2186
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:31,640
It's very beautiful, a perfect heart shape.

2187
02:29:31,640 --> 02:29:34,640
I've never seen anything like it, Moomin.

2188
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:36,640
Would you like one, Mama?

2189
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:37,640
No, my dear.

2190
02:29:37,640 --> 02:29:39,640
There should only be one shell like this.

2191
02:29:39,640 --> 02:29:42,640
Then would you keep it somewhere safe for me?

2192
02:29:48,640 --> 02:29:51,640
Well, Snork Maiden.

2193
02:29:51,640 --> 02:29:54,640
I'm sure Snork Maiden will get it out of him.

2194
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:55,640
I do hope so.

2195
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:58,640
I think they like it anyway.

2196
02:29:58,640 --> 02:30:02,640
I have a feeling in my bones that Groke will be back tonight.

2197
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:06,640
If we could find out why she's after them, we'd know what to do.

2198
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:11,640
Mama won't have any garden left if that monster comes back every night.

2199
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:14,640
Moomin.

2200
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:24,640
Well done, Snork Maiden.

2201
02:30:25,640 --> 02:30:28,640
Little Mai.

2202
02:30:31,640 --> 02:30:35,640
Oh no, she'll ruin everything if we don't stop her.

2203
02:30:39,640 --> 02:30:42,640
If you interfere, little Mai, I'll never forgive you.

2204
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:45,640
What, interfere? Me? Never.

2205
02:30:45,640 --> 02:30:48,640
Look, let's just leave it up to Snork Maiden now, little Mai.

2206
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:52,640
You'll need me if Snork Maiden's not tender and understanding enough.

2207
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:55,640
Hey, Moomin.

2208
02:30:55,640 --> 02:30:59,640
So, how is Snork Maiden getting on her, taking them for a stroll?

2209
02:30:59,640 --> 02:31:02,640
Where are they?

2210
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:11,640
If we were narrow.

2211
02:31:11,640 --> 02:31:13,640
Papa, if we get much closer.

2212
02:31:13,640 --> 02:31:17,640
And the last thing we want is for them to see us.

2213
02:31:17,640 --> 02:31:20,640
Looks like I'll have to go and talk to them. You're all too big.

2214
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:22,640
I'll come back later and tell you what they said.

2215
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:25,640
No, don't. You'll upset Snork Maiden.

2216
02:31:25,640 --> 02:31:27,640
You're the one who's upsetting her.

2217
02:31:27,640 --> 02:31:29,640
Shh.

2218
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:33,640
All right. Can I ask you again about the suitcase?

2219
02:31:33,640 --> 02:31:34,640
Yes.

2220
02:31:34,640 --> 02:31:37,640
Does that suitcase belong to you or is it the Groakes?

2221
02:31:37,640 --> 02:31:39,640
No.

2222
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:45,640
Let's try it another way. Who's is that suitcase?

2223
02:31:45,640 --> 02:31:48,640
It's ours, it's ours.

2224
02:31:48,640 --> 02:31:53,640
But you told Moomin Mama that it wasn't yours. It was the Groakes.

2225
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:55,640
Yes, we did.

2226
02:31:55,640 --> 02:31:57,640
Oh.

2227
02:31:57,640 --> 02:32:01,640
Do you mind if I ask you one more time?

2228
02:32:01,640 --> 02:32:03,640
Please do.

2229
02:32:03,640 --> 02:32:05,640
Right. Here we go.

2230
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:08,640
Now, all I want is a simple yes or no.

2231
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:10,640
Is that suitcase yours or not?

2232
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:12,640
No, yes.

2233
02:32:12,640 --> 02:32:14,640
Oh.

2234
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:16,640
Take your time, Snork Maiden.

2235
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:18,640
Don't rush them, he said.

2236
02:32:18,640 --> 02:32:20,640
What was that Snork Maiden?

2237
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:24,640
Look, I'm sorry, but can I ask you again?

2238
02:32:24,640 --> 02:32:26,640
Yes, as many times as you want.

2239
02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:29,640
Thank you. This is the very last time.

2240
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:31,640
So please tell me the truth.

2241
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:36,640
Now then, the suitcase.

2242
02:32:36,640 --> 02:32:37,640
Yes.

2243
02:32:37,640 --> 02:32:38,640
You know which one?

2244
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:39,640
Yes.

2245
02:32:39,640 --> 02:32:41,640
Does it belong to you?

2246
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:42,640
Yes, it does.

2247
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:44,640
So it's not the Groakes.

2248
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:45,640
Yes, it is not the Groakes.

2249
02:32:45,640 --> 02:32:49,640
At last, we're getting somewhere, praise the booble.

2250
02:32:49,640 --> 02:32:52,640
We're very happy for you.

2251
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:55,640
Snork Maiden is really having to work hard.

2252
02:32:55,640 --> 02:32:57,640
I wouldn't have, I'd scare them into talking.

2253
02:32:57,640 --> 02:32:59,640
You should have let me go.

2254
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:01,640
Yeah, but we wanted someone gentle.

2255
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:03,640
Snork Maiden is nice.

2256
02:33:03,640 --> 02:33:06,640
Everybody in this house is nice.

2257
02:33:06,640 --> 02:33:09,640
Do you think they'd let us stay here forever?

2258
02:33:09,640 --> 02:33:10,640
Of course.

2259
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:13,640
If we can keep away from the Groak.

2260
02:33:15,640 --> 02:33:19,640
It took a long time, but in the end they trusted me, and now we're good friends.

2261
02:33:19,640 --> 02:33:22,640
Who wouldn't trust you and want to be good friends?

2262
02:33:22,640 --> 02:33:25,640
Thank you. It wasn't easy, though.

2263
02:33:25,640 --> 02:33:28,640
They kept speaking together, and I got rather muddled.

2264
02:33:28,640 --> 02:33:30,640
But they did tell me somehow.

2265
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:31,640
Rather muddled.

2266
02:33:31,640 --> 02:33:33,640
I told you guys, you should have let me do it.

2267
02:33:33,640 --> 02:33:36,640
Oh, I'm afraid I didn't get very much, though.

2268
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:38,640
I knew you wouldn't.

2269
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:42,640
So what did you find out then, Snork Maiden?

2270
02:33:42,640 --> 02:33:43,640
Tell us.

2271
02:33:43,640 --> 02:33:46,640
Well, first of all, the suitcase does seem to be theirs.

2272
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:48,640
That was one thing they made very clear.

2273
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:50,640
Then Hulk and the Groak, just a minute movement,

2274
02:33:50,640 --> 02:33:54,640
what's in the suitcase on the other hand, belongs to the Groak.

2275
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:56,640
That's the problem.

2276
02:33:56,640 --> 02:33:57,640
Oh, dear.

2277
02:33:57,640 --> 02:34:00,640
So they do have something belonging to a...

2278
02:34:00,640 --> 02:34:02,640
Well, Snork Maiden, what is it?

2279
02:34:02,640 --> 02:34:04,640
They wouldn't tell me what it is, little Mai.

2280
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:08,640
Only that it is the most beautiful thing in the world.

2281
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:09,640
So, is it?

2282
02:34:09,640 --> 02:34:11,640
I wonder.

2283
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:14,640
This is very difficult to understand.

2284
02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:18,640
I mean, thingamy and Bob don't look like thieves at all, do they?

2285
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:21,640
So, the Groak just wanted back what is hers.

2286
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:26,640
I don't see how that big ugly monster could own the most beautiful thing in the world.

2287
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:29,640
Well, what they said was that she just happened to have it.

2288
02:34:29,640 --> 02:34:32,640
They didn't say whether it belonged to her or not.

2289
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:34,640
So she might have stolen it herself.

2290
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:36,640
They shouldn't have taken it, though.

2291
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:38,640
Oh, dear, oh dear.

2292
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:43,640
Bob and Thingamy are very frightened of how she'll take her revenge if she catches them.

2293
02:34:43,640 --> 02:34:47,640
But they're very determined to keep what's in the suitcase, Moomin Papa.

2294
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:50,640
Oh, this is a fine mess indeed.

2295
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:52,640
The Groak is sure to come back tonight.

2296
02:34:52,640 --> 02:34:53,640
What can we do?

2297
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:55,640
What can we do?

2298
02:34:55,640 --> 02:34:56,640
What can we do?

2299
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:58,640
We can do the same as before.

2300
02:34:58,640 --> 02:35:00,640
Yeah, but it's not fair to drive her away.

2301
02:35:00,640 --> 02:35:04,640
If what's in the suitcase really does belong to her?

2302
02:35:04,640 --> 02:35:09,640
She means to get the suitcase and I don't think it will be so easy to get rid of her this time.

2303
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:13,640
And if she stays, we'll have a never-ending winter.

2304
02:35:13,640 --> 02:35:16,640
Well, I'll cover up the petunias just in case.

2305
02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:18,640
Are you all going to stay here?

2306
02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:19,640
I'll look after Snork.

2307
02:35:19,640 --> 02:35:21,640
I will, Moomin Mama, I'll stay.

2308
02:35:21,640 --> 02:35:23,640
You'll stay, won't you, Snefkin?

2309
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:25,640
Don't look so clump, everyone.

2310
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:26,640
I've got an idea.

2311
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:29,640
But it would help if we knew what was in that suitcase.

2312
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:31,640
But even if we didn't, it could still work.

2313
02:35:31,640 --> 02:35:33,640
What is it, dear?

2314
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:36,640
Just wait, Papa. You'll see.

2315
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:35,640
Oh!

2316
02:36:47,640 --> 02:36:49,640
She's coming!

2317
02:36:49,640 --> 02:36:50,640
Are we?

2318
02:36:50,640 --> 02:36:52,640
She's out of her way!

2319
02:36:52,640 --> 02:36:54,640
Oh, I hope Moomin Papa can do something.

2320
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:56,640
It's your girl, little mom.

2321
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:59,640
Yes, I know. There's the king and the queen.

2322
02:36:59,640 --> 02:37:01,640
Uh, this one.

2323
02:37:01,640 --> 02:37:03,640
Uh-oh, she's coming.

2324
02:37:03,640 --> 02:37:05,640
Just when I was winning.

2325
02:37:05,640 --> 02:37:08,640
You better hide under the table, little my.

2326
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:12,640
Don't be stupid. How can I hit her with my rolling pin from there?

2327
02:37:21,640 --> 02:37:23,640
Where is she, Papa?

2328
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:25,640
Exactly where she was yesterday.

2329
02:37:25,640 --> 02:37:27,640
I'll go for a toast, alright, Papa?

2330
02:37:27,640 --> 02:37:32,640
Let me go first, and then the rest of you can fan out behind me.

2331
02:37:32,640 --> 02:37:34,640
Moomin Mama.

2332
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:35,640
What is it, Papa?

2333
02:37:35,640 --> 02:37:38,640
Perhaps now's the time to tell us your idea.

2334
02:37:38,640 --> 02:37:40,640
We haven't long.

2335
02:37:53,640 --> 02:37:55,640
Wait, Grog.

2336
02:37:55,640 --> 02:37:58,640
Don't go away. We want to talk to you.

2337
02:37:58,640 --> 02:38:04,640
We know that you've come back to get what thing of me and Bob took from you.

2338
02:38:04,640 --> 02:38:07,640
That is right, isn't it, huh?

2339
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:12,640
Won't you let them keep it, perhaps?

2340
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:17,640
No, will you sell it to them?

2341
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:21,640
Oh, dear.

2342
02:38:21,640 --> 02:38:25,640
I have some very beautiful things here in my bag.

2343
02:38:25,640 --> 02:38:28,640
Maybe you'd like to trade, Grog.

2344
02:38:37,640 --> 02:38:39,640
What about this pendant?

2345
02:38:39,640 --> 02:38:41,640
Isn't it lovely?

2346
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:47,640
So you don't like that?

2347
02:38:47,640 --> 02:38:49,640
What about this then?

2348
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:54,640
Or this?

2349
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:04,640
Alright, why don't you choose?

2350
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:08,640
Take anything you want from my handbag, except the hair slide.

2351
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:19,640
Which one do you want, this one?

2352
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:22,640
Let me see with this.

2353
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:26,640
Oh, this one?

2354
02:39:28,640 --> 02:39:31,640
Oh, dear, that's not really mine to give to you.

2355
02:39:31,640 --> 02:39:33,640
Snork maiden gave that to Moomin.

2356
02:39:33,640 --> 02:39:36,640
Is it alright if I give the shell to her Moomin?

2357
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:40,640
Oh, you'll never allow.

2358
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:42,640
Are you alright?

2359
02:39:42,640 --> 02:39:45,640
Yes, my hand was suddenly frozen.

2360
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:48,640
No, you've got the shell, Mrs. Grog.

2361
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:51,640
Do you promise not to come back anymore?

2362
02:39:54,640 --> 02:39:57,640
Because I'll get you if you do.

2363
02:39:58,640 --> 02:40:02,640
Oh, my God!

2364
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:14,640
Well, that was a close thing.

2365
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:16,640
I'm glad that's over.

2366
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:19,640
Oh, you are marvelous, Mama.

2367
02:40:21,640 --> 02:40:23,640
I'm so sorry, Moomin.

2368
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:27,640
I forgot that I had put your precious shell in my handbag to keep it safe.

2369
02:40:27,640 --> 02:40:29,640
It's alright, Mama.

2370
02:40:29,640 --> 02:40:31,640
You gave it in a good cause.

2371
02:40:32,640 --> 02:40:35,640
What Snork maiden gonna say, Moomin?

2372
02:40:36,640 --> 02:40:37,640
I heard you.

2373
02:40:37,640 --> 02:40:39,640
You said you'd never go to sleep without kissing it.

2374
02:40:39,640 --> 02:40:41,640
Or something equally stupid.

2375
02:40:42,640 --> 02:40:44,640
Well, I'm not gonna tell Snork maiden.

2376
02:40:44,640 --> 02:40:47,640
But I think Mama did the right thing.

2377
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:49,640
She'll find out.

2378
02:40:49,640 --> 02:40:51,640
I'm fed up with secrets.

2379
02:40:51,640 --> 02:40:54,640
I'm always gonna tell the truth from now on, no matter what.

2380
02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:05,640
Moomin, Moomin!

2381
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:07,640
Look, I found one.

2382
02:41:07,640 --> 02:41:08,640
Really?

2383
02:41:09,640 --> 02:41:11,640
Well, it's very similar.

2384
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:14,640
But the one Snork maiden gave me was much bigger.

2385
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:16,640
Oh, a lot bigger, was it?

2386
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:21,640
Moomin had decided that he had to find a shell that was exactly the same as the one Snork maiden had given him.

2387
02:41:21,640 --> 02:41:25,640
Then with luck, she would never find out what he'd done with it.

2388
02:41:39,640 --> 02:41:41,640
This is it!

2389
02:41:41,640 --> 02:41:42,640
This is it!

2390
02:41:42,640 --> 02:41:44,640
I killed it!

2391
02:41:47,640 --> 02:41:49,640
It's exactly the same as the other one!

2392
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:52,640
Nothing short of a miracle, isn't it?

2393
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:55,640
But then in Moomin Valley, miracles do happen.

2394
02:41:58,640 --> 02:42:04,640
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

2395
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:11,640
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2396
02:42:12,640 --> 02:42:16,640
They're always happy and always at play.

2397
02:42:16,640 --> 02:42:20,640
The movements are having fun day after day.

2398
02:42:20,640 --> 02:42:23,640
The movements.

2399
02:42:23,640 --> 02:42:27,640
The movements.

2400
02:42:27,640 --> 02:42:34,640
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

2401
02:42:34,640 --> 02:42:40,640
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2402
02:42:42,640 --> 02:42:45,640
They're always happy and always at play.

2403
02:42:45,640 --> 02:42:49,640
The movements are having fun day after day.

2404
02:42:49,640 --> 02:42:52,640
The movements.

2405
02:42:52,640 --> 02:42:56,640
The movements.

2406
02:42:56,640 --> 02:43:02,640
The movements.

2407
02:43:12,640 --> 02:43:17,640
The movements.

2408
02:43:22,640 --> 02:43:25,640
Here they are for one and all.

2409
02:43:25,640 --> 02:43:28,640
The movements are about to come.

2410
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:31,640
Come on and sit down here with me.

2411
02:43:31,640 --> 02:43:36,640
There for you on your TV they are the movements.

2412
02:43:36,640 --> 02:43:39,640
They are the movements.

2413
02:43:39,640 --> 02:43:42,640
Don't come with me, give me your hand.

2414
02:43:42,640 --> 02:43:45,640
I'll take you up to Moomin Land.

2415
02:43:45,640 --> 02:43:48,640
You can fly just like a bird.

2416
02:43:48,640 --> 02:43:50,640
Sing that song ever.

2417
02:43:50,640 --> 02:43:53,640
There were the movements.

2418
02:43:53,640 --> 02:43:56,640
There were the movements.

2419
02:43:56,640 --> 02:43:59,640
There were the movements.

2420
02:43:59,640 --> 02:44:02,640
There were the movements.

2421
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:05,640
There were the movements.

2422
02:44:05,640 --> 02:44:08,640
There were the movements.

2423
02:44:08,640 --> 02:44:38,640
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

2425
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:10,640
Oops!

2426
02:45:10,640 --> 02:45:12,640
Oh, thank you, Mama.

2427
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:14,640
We weren't looking where we were going.

2428
02:45:14,640 --> 02:45:16,640
That's all right.

2429
02:45:18,640 --> 02:45:19,640
Here's your bag.

2430
02:45:19,640 --> 02:45:20,640
Thank you, Thingamy.

2431
02:45:20,640 --> 02:45:21,640
Are you going out?

2432
02:45:21,640 --> 02:45:23,640
Yes, for a walk.

2433
02:45:23,640 --> 02:45:24,640
We'll have fun.

2434
02:45:30,640 --> 02:45:35,640
It seems that Thingamy and Bob are well and truly part of Movement House now.

2435
02:45:35,640 --> 02:45:37,640
Luckily, they don't eat a lot.

2436
02:45:37,640 --> 02:45:43,640
And they're small enough to find the pencils that fall between the floorboards in the porch.

2437
02:45:47,640 --> 02:45:49,640
Hey, this looks like a great hiding place.

2438
02:45:49,640 --> 02:45:51,640
Nobody would ever find it here.

2439
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:56,640
Come on, Bob. Let's go get the suitcase, man.

2440
02:45:56,640 --> 02:45:58,640
Are you sure it's not safe for an alarm?

2441
02:46:00,640 --> 02:46:03,640
What would you say if someone went in when we weren't there?

2442
02:46:03,640 --> 02:46:05,640
You wouldn't like it, would you?

2443
02:46:07,640 --> 02:46:11,640
I think the Moomons are much too nice to do anything like that.

2444
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:14,640
It's not them. It's the guests I'm thinking about.

2445
02:46:14,640 --> 02:46:17,640
You know the Moomons let anybody stay.

2446
02:46:19,640 --> 02:46:21,640
Snork Maiden.

2447
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:24,640
You lied to me, little Mai.

2448
02:46:24,640 --> 02:46:25,640
Who me?

2449
02:46:25,640 --> 02:46:28,640
Moomons still has the shell that I gave him.

2450
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:30,640
But you said that he didn't.

2451
02:46:30,640 --> 02:46:31,640
And possible.

2452
02:46:31,640 --> 02:46:33,640
Moom and Mama gave it to the croak.

2453
02:46:33,640 --> 02:46:35,640
I was there when she did it.

2454
02:46:35,640 --> 02:46:38,640
Look, I saw it. He showed it to me.

2455
02:46:38,640 --> 02:46:40,640
Are you really sure? Was it the same one?

2456
02:46:40,640 --> 02:46:43,640
Of course it was. I'm not stupid, you know.

2457
02:46:43,640 --> 02:46:47,640
That's very odd. I saw her do it with my own eyes.

2458
02:46:47,640 --> 02:46:50,640
Well, I'll go and ask Moomons right now, little Mai.

2459
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:54,640
It's a bit awkward. But if I'm going to be honest, Snork Maiden.

2460
02:46:54,640 --> 02:47:00,640
What? Well, I've decided that from now on I'm only going to tell the truth.

2461
02:47:00,640 --> 02:47:01,640
Oh, yes.

2462
02:47:01,640 --> 02:47:03,640
And I found something you might be interested in.

2463
02:47:03,640 --> 02:47:05,640
Well, what is it?

2464
02:47:05,640 --> 02:47:07,640
Mungle and I were down on the beach yesterday.

2465
02:47:07,640 --> 02:47:10,640
And you remember all those things we found washed up by the storm?

2466
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:14,640
Do you mean on the Hattie Fatter's island that we sailed to?

2467
02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:18,640
Yes. And do you remember the figurehead that Moomon liked best of all?

2468
02:47:18,640 --> 02:47:21,640
You know, the lady made of wood and painted.

2469
02:47:21,640 --> 02:47:23,640
She was really lovely, wasn't she?

2470
02:47:23,640 --> 02:47:25,640
Yes, I remember.

2471
02:47:25,640 --> 02:47:26,640
Moomon wanted to keep it.

2472
02:47:26,640 --> 02:47:28,640
So what about it?

2473
02:47:28,640 --> 02:47:29,640
Well, it's here on the beach.

2474
02:47:29,640 --> 02:47:31,640
It was still the same.

2475
02:47:32,640 --> 02:47:34,640
As beautiful as ever.

2476
02:47:34,640 --> 02:47:35,640
Was it the same one?

2477
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:37,640
Yes, I remember her pretty face.

2478
02:47:37,640 --> 02:47:38,640
No legs, though.

2479
02:47:38,640 --> 02:47:40,640
She's just a silly wooden doll.

2480
02:47:40,640 --> 02:47:42,640
Oh, I know that.

2481
02:47:42,640 --> 02:47:45,640
But she's got those gorgeous eyes in lovely long hair.

2482
02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:49,640
Little Mai, why all this fuss about this silly figurehead?

2483
02:47:49,640 --> 02:47:50,640
Trust him.

2484
02:47:50,640 --> 02:47:53,640
Only someone as stupid as Moomon could fall in love with a figurehead.

2485
02:47:53,640 --> 02:47:56,640
It's probably still dreaming about her every night.

2486
02:47:56,640 --> 02:47:58,640
Do you think it's still there?

2487
02:47:58,640 --> 02:48:01,640
Charles Nork Maiden, if no one else has found her already.

2488
02:48:01,640 --> 02:48:05,640
Do you think the ocean might come and wash her away again?

2489
02:48:05,640 --> 02:48:08,640
Why all these silly questions, Nork Maiden?

2490
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:11,640
Moomon would go and rescue her if he knew.

2491
02:48:11,640 --> 02:48:12,640
So?

2492
02:48:12,640 --> 02:48:13,640
That would be terrible.

2493
02:48:13,640 --> 02:48:15,640
I couldn't bear it at all.

2494
02:48:15,640 --> 02:48:16,640
I really couldn't.

2495
02:48:16,640 --> 02:48:18,640
How pathetic.

2496
02:48:18,640 --> 02:48:23,640
He'll probably take her home and keep her in his room forever.

2497
02:48:23,640 --> 02:48:26,640
My expect she's too big to go through the door.

2498
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:30,640
He'll just sit and stare at her with that lovesick look on his face.

2499
02:48:30,640 --> 02:48:31,640
I know he will.

2500
02:48:31,640 --> 02:48:32,640
Oh!

2501
02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:33,640
Where are you going now?

2502
02:48:33,640 --> 02:48:35,640
I thought you were going to Moomon house.

2503
02:48:35,640 --> 02:48:38,640
I was, but there's something more important I have to do.

2504
02:48:43,640 --> 02:48:45,640
Okay, it's Chris.

2505
02:48:46,640 --> 02:48:49,640
Hey, you two, you're not leaving, are you?

2506
02:48:49,640 --> 02:48:51,640
No, we're just, uh, we're going.

2507
02:48:51,640 --> 02:48:54,640
Why have you got the suitcase, then?

2508
02:48:54,640 --> 02:48:57,640
Look, Moomon, would you help us with something?

2509
02:48:57,640 --> 02:48:59,640
Of course.

2510
02:49:02,640 --> 02:49:04,640
Thank you very much, Moomon.

2511
02:49:04,640 --> 02:49:05,640
Oh, that's okay.

2512
02:49:05,640 --> 02:49:08,640
It's a bit too big for you to go.

2513
02:49:08,640 --> 02:49:10,640
I'm sorry.

2514
02:49:10,640 --> 02:49:12,640
Thank you very much, Moomon.

2515
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:13,640
Oh, that's okay.

2516
02:49:13,640 --> 02:49:15,640
It's a bit too big for you to carry.

2517
02:49:15,640 --> 02:49:17,640
We can take it from here.

2518
02:49:17,640 --> 02:49:18,640
It's all right.

2519
02:49:18,640 --> 02:49:20,640
It's not very heavy.

2520
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:23,640
Oh, silly me.

2521
02:49:23,640 --> 02:49:26,640
It wouldn't be a very secret place if I'd seen it.

2522
02:49:26,640 --> 02:49:27,640
Would it?

2523
02:49:27,640 --> 02:49:28,640
I'll see you later.

2524
02:49:28,640 --> 02:49:29,640
Don't be too long now.

2525
02:49:29,640 --> 02:49:31,640
How much you won't tell anyone, will you?

2526
02:49:31,640 --> 02:49:33,640
Of course I won't.

2527
02:49:33,640 --> 02:49:35,640
Oh, oh, oh.

2528
02:49:35,640 --> 02:49:39,640
Hey, what are you doing up there, little my?

2529
02:49:39,640 --> 02:49:40,640
I'm coming down.

2530
02:49:40,640 --> 02:49:42,640
What does it look like?

2531
02:49:42,640 --> 02:49:44,640
You're much too small to do, there.

2532
02:49:44,640 --> 02:49:47,640
The rungs are too far apart for you to reach.

2533
02:49:47,640 --> 02:49:48,640
Just you watch me.

2534
02:49:48,640 --> 02:49:49,640
Oh.

2535
02:49:49,640 --> 02:49:50,640
Oh.

2536
02:49:50,640 --> 02:49:51,640
Oh.

2537
02:49:51,640 --> 02:49:52,640
Oh.

2538
02:49:52,640 --> 02:49:53,640
Oh.

2539
02:49:53,640 --> 02:49:54,640
Oh.

2540
02:49:54,640 --> 02:49:55,640
Oh.

2541
02:49:55,640 --> 02:49:56,640
Oh.

2542
02:49:56,640 --> 02:49:57,640
Oh.

2543
02:49:57,640 --> 02:49:58,640
Oh.

2544
02:49:58,640 --> 02:49:59,640
Oh.

2545
02:49:59,640 --> 02:50:01,640
Hey, what are you doing up there, little my?

2546
02:50:02,640 --> 02:50:03,640
Oh.

2547
02:50:03,640 --> 02:50:05,640
Oh.

2548
02:50:08,640 --> 02:50:11,640
Moonman, I have a problem.

2549
02:50:11,640 --> 02:50:13,640
Do you mind if I ask you something?

2550
02:50:13,640 --> 02:50:14,640
Go ahead.

2551
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:18,640
Did Moonman Mama give Snorkman's hard shape shell to the goat?

2552
02:50:18,640 --> 02:50:20,640
Yes, she did.

2553
02:50:20,640 --> 02:50:23,640
So you and the Groek can't both have it, can you?

2554
02:50:23,640 --> 02:50:26,640
That's just where you're wrong.

2555
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:30,140
But that's simply impossible you can't have.

2556
02:50:30,140 --> 02:50:32,940
The Groke's simply got another one.

2557
02:50:32,940 --> 02:50:34,740
That's not true!

2558
02:50:34,740 --> 02:50:38,340
All right, but it would only upset Snorke made an if she knew.

2559
02:50:38,340 --> 02:50:40,140
So I'm not going to tell her.

2560
02:50:40,140 --> 02:50:41,340
You rotten thing!

2561
02:50:41,340 --> 02:50:43,340
Why don't you just tell me the truth?

2562
02:50:43,340 --> 02:50:44,940
Because it's a secret.

2563
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:46,340
But I want to know, Moomin!

2564
02:50:47,340 --> 02:50:48,340
Look, Moomin!

2565
02:50:48,340 --> 02:50:52,340
Now, why don't you tell me your secret and then I'll tell you mine!

2566
02:50:52,340 --> 02:50:53,340
What is it?

2567
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:55,140
Really very top secret.

2568
02:50:55,140 --> 02:50:56,940
Go on then, tell me.

2569
02:50:57,740 --> 02:50:59,140
Tell me yours first.

2570
02:50:59,340 --> 02:51:01,340
No, you tell me first.

2571
02:51:01,340 --> 02:51:03,540
I know, let's say them together.

2572
02:51:03,540 --> 02:51:04,740
All right.

2573
02:51:04,740 --> 02:51:06,140
Ready?

2574
02:51:06,140 --> 02:51:07,940
One, two, three.

2575
02:51:07,940 --> 02:51:10,140
After we go to the show and I went to the beach yesterday,

2576
02:51:10,140 --> 02:51:11,140
I would like to be there.

2577
02:51:11,140 --> 02:51:12,340
We'll find something that you like.

2578
02:51:12,340 --> 02:51:14,340
Please, so I'll have a bigger head later.

2579
02:51:14,340 --> 02:51:15,340
I just like it.

2580
02:51:16,340 --> 02:51:17,340
What did you say?

2581
02:51:17,340 --> 02:51:18,340
The figurehead?

2582
02:51:18,340 --> 02:51:19,340
Yes, by the K.

2583
02:51:20,740 --> 02:51:21,740
Wait a minute!

2584
02:51:21,740 --> 02:51:23,740
You didn't finish telling me your secret!

2585
02:51:23,740 --> 02:51:25,140
I'll tell you later!

2586
02:51:25,140 --> 02:51:26,140
That's not there!

2587
02:51:26,140 --> 02:51:28,140
You've got to tell me now!

2588
02:51:30,140 --> 02:51:31,140
Oh!

2589
02:51:51,140 --> 02:51:53,140
What do you think Moomin's doing?

2590
02:51:53,140 --> 02:51:54,140
I don't know.

2591
02:51:54,140 --> 02:51:56,140
Maybe he's looking for shells again.

2592
02:51:57,140 --> 02:51:59,140
I don't think so.

2593
02:51:59,140 --> 02:52:01,140
He looks a bit worried to me.

2594
02:52:01,140 --> 02:52:04,140
Maybe he's lost something important.

2595
02:52:08,140 --> 02:52:11,140
How much further do we have to go?

2596
02:52:11,140 --> 02:52:13,140
As far as you can road.

2597
02:52:13,140 --> 02:52:15,140
We're a long way out already, you know.

2598
02:52:15,140 --> 02:52:18,140
I want to make sure that the lady will never turn up again.

2599
02:52:18,140 --> 02:52:20,140
We must go further out.

2600
02:52:20,140 --> 02:52:22,140
We must be far enough by now.

2601
02:52:22,140 --> 02:52:23,140
I'm tired.

2602
02:52:24,140 --> 02:52:25,140
No!

2603
02:52:25,140 --> 02:52:27,140
The curds could still drag her in from here.

2604
02:52:27,140 --> 02:52:28,140
Keep going!

2605
02:52:38,140 --> 02:52:40,140
He looks very unhappy.

2606
02:52:40,140 --> 02:52:41,140
We've got to cheer him up.

2607
02:52:41,140 --> 02:52:42,140
But how?

2608
02:52:42,140 --> 02:52:44,140
There's only one way, Bob.

2609
02:52:44,140 --> 02:52:46,140
Yes, you're right, thing of me.

2610
02:52:54,140 --> 02:52:56,140
Hello.

2611
02:52:56,140 --> 02:52:58,140
You look so sad, Moomin.

2612
02:52:58,140 --> 02:53:01,140
But we thought we'd try to make you happy again.

2613
02:53:04,140 --> 02:53:06,140
You don't mind, do you?

2614
02:53:06,140 --> 02:53:08,140
No, but you don't have to.

2615
02:53:08,140 --> 02:53:10,140
I'm alright, really.

2616
02:53:12,140 --> 02:53:14,140
How about this then, Moomin?

2617
02:53:14,140 --> 02:53:16,140
We're going to show you what's in our suitcase.

2618
02:53:16,140 --> 02:53:17,140
Go!

2619
02:53:17,140 --> 02:53:18,140
Would you like that, Moomin?

2620
02:53:18,140 --> 02:53:20,140
It's very interesting.

2621
02:53:20,140 --> 02:53:22,140
Oh my gosh!

2622
02:53:22,140 --> 02:53:24,140
Will you?

2623
02:53:32,140 --> 02:53:34,140
Do you need some help in there?

2624
02:53:34,140 --> 02:53:36,140
No, I think we can manage.

2625
02:53:41,140 --> 02:53:43,140
Thank you, Moomin.

2626
02:53:44,140 --> 02:53:45,140
Now we'll open it.

2627
02:53:45,140 --> 02:53:46,140
Yes, now.

2628
02:53:46,140 --> 02:53:48,140
One, two, three.

2629
02:53:48,140 --> 02:53:50,140
Oh gosh!

2630
02:53:50,140 --> 02:53:52,140
By my tail.

2631
02:53:54,140 --> 02:53:55,140
Do you like it?

2632
02:53:55,140 --> 02:53:57,140
Oh boy, do I like it?

2633
02:53:57,140 --> 02:53:59,140
Then you're not sad anymore, Moomin.

2634
02:53:59,140 --> 02:54:00,140
Oh no!

2635
02:54:00,140 --> 02:54:02,140
That's good, isn't it?

2636
02:54:02,140 --> 02:54:04,140
Yes, very good.

2637
02:54:08,140 --> 02:54:11,140
It was such a beautiful ruby.

2638
02:54:11,140 --> 02:54:15,140
How it changed color from soft red to soft red blue

2639
02:54:15,140 --> 02:54:16,140
and then to pink?

2640
02:54:16,140 --> 02:54:19,140
One minute, it was like a flame leaping out of the center.

2641
02:54:19,140 --> 02:54:21,140
Then suddenly it was like a blood tulip.

2642
02:54:21,140 --> 02:54:22,140
It was...

2643
02:54:22,140 --> 02:54:25,140
Hmm, perhaps that's the king's ruby.

2644
02:54:25,140 --> 02:54:28,140
It was just beautiful.

2645
02:54:28,140 --> 02:54:30,140
That's the one the hob goblin is searching for.

2646
02:54:30,140 --> 02:54:32,140
Oh, no.

2647
02:54:32,140 --> 02:54:36,140
However far away he is, he'll come back on his black panther, looking for it.

2648
02:54:36,140 --> 02:54:38,140
And he's sure to find it.

2649
02:54:38,140 --> 02:54:41,140
Because he'll know that thing of me and Bob have it.

2650
02:54:41,140 --> 02:54:43,140
First the Groke and now the hob goblin.

2651
02:54:43,140 --> 02:54:45,140
What are we going to do?

2652
02:54:49,140 --> 02:54:51,140
No more than a week later,

2653
02:54:51,140 --> 02:54:53,140
and like a bolt from the blue,

2654
02:54:53,140 --> 02:54:56,140
a real catastrophe hit Moomin Valley.

2655
02:55:00,140 --> 02:55:02,140
Hmm.

2656
02:55:02,140 --> 02:55:04,140
No, it's not in the bedroom either.

2657
02:55:04,140 --> 02:55:06,140
Oh, that's very odd.

2658
02:55:06,140 --> 02:55:08,140
Where did you see it last?

2659
02:55:08,140 --> 02:55:10,140
I'm sure it was here somewhere, Papa.

2660
02:55:10,140 --> 02:55:13,140
Well, perhaps it's in the garden.

2661
02:55:15,140 --> 02:55:18,140
No, I haven't been out here all day.

2662
02:55:19,140 --> 02:55:21,140
Moomin Mama's handbag is missing.

2663
02:55:21,140 --> 02:55:25,140
Full of useful things like socks and sweets and string.

2664
02:55:29,140 --> 02:55:30,140
What's the matter, Mama?

2665
02:55:30,140 --> 02:55:33,140
I can't find my handbag and I'm lost without it.

2666
02:55:33,140 --> 02:55:34,140
We've looked everywhere.

2667
02:55:34,140 --> 02:55:37,140
Will I get a reward if I find it, Moomin Mama?

2668
02:55:37,140 --> 02:55:40,140
Yes, we'll have a big party for everyone

2669
02:55:40,140 --> 02:55:42,140
with cakes, jelly, and everything.

2670
02:55:42,140 --> 02:55:46,140
And as a special treat, no one has to wash or go to bed early.

2671
02:55:47,140 --> 02:55:48,140
I'll find it, Mama.

2672
02:55:48,140 --> 02:55:49,140
No, I will.

2673
02:55:56,140 --> 02:55:58,140
Moomin Mama, I've checked the cellar.

2674
02:55:58,140 --> 02:55:59,140
It's not there.

2675
02:55:59,140 --> 02:56:01,140
Oh, dear, where could it be?

2676
02:56:01,140 --> 02:56:03,140
I haven't been in the cellar for days,

2677
02:56:03,140 --> 02:56:05,140
so I didn't think it would be there,

2678
02:56:05,140 --> 02:56:07,140
but thank you, dear Snork.

2679
02:56:16,140 --> 02:56:19,140
Word got round Moomin Valley of the missing handbag,

2680
02:56:19,140 --> 02:56:22,140
and soon everyone was helping to look for it.

2681
02:56:25,140 --> 02:56:27,140
What a lot of people.

2682
02:56:27,140 --> 02:56:29,140
I wonder what they're looking for.

2683
02:56:38,140 --> 02:56:40,140
What's everybody looking for?

2684
02:56:40,140 --> 02:56:42,140
My handbag, thingamy.

2685
02:56:42,140 --> 02:56:45,140
The one with the two nice little pockets?

2686
02:56:45,140 --> 02:56:46,140
Yes, that's the one.

2687
02:56:46,140 --> 02:56:48,140
It's been missing for days.

2688
02:56:48,140 --> 02:56:50,140
Will you two help us look?

2689
02:56:53,140 --> 02:56:57,140
It makes such a lovely place to sleep, and don't you think?

2690
02:57:00,140 --> 02:57:02,140
Moomin Mama looks very sad.

2691
02:57:02,140 --> 02:57:04,140
Perhaps we better give it back.

2692
02:57:16,140 --> 02:57:17,140
Oh.

2693
02:57:21,140 --> 02:57:24,140
Oh, you found it.

2694
02:57:25,140 --> 02:57:28,140
Look, everybody, thingamy and Bob have found it.

2695
02:57:34,140 --> 02:57:36,140
Oh, thank you.

2696
02:57:36,140 --> 02:57:38,140
Where on earth did you find it?

2697
02:57:38,140 --> 02:57:40,140
In the bush under the white birch tree.

2698
02:57:40,140 --> 02:57:43,140
It's a very, very nice handbag.

2699
02:57:43,140 --> 02:57:48,140
Let's have a party tonight to celebrate the return of Mama's handbag.

2700
02:57:50,140 --> 02:57:54,140
As you all know, this party is in honor of thingamy and Bob,

2701
02:57:54,140 --> 02:57:56,140
finding Moomin Mama's handbag,

2702
02:57:56,140 --> 02:57:59,140
and to thank everyone who took part in the big search.

2703
02:58:00,140 --> 02:58:02,140
Let's raise our glasses to our heroes.

2704
02:58:02,140 --> 02:58:04,140
Is to thingamy and Bob,

2705
02:58:04,140 --> 02:58:07,140
who found Moomin Mama's handbag without which Moomin Valley

2706
02:58:07,140 --> 02:58:09,140
would never be the same again.

2707
02:58:10,140 --> 02:58:11,140
Cheers.

2708
02:58:14,140 --> 02:58:17,140
Now, I think Moomin would like to say a few words.

2709
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:18,140
Moomin.

2710
02:58:18,140 --> 02:58:22,140
We're very pleased that Mama's handbag is back again.

2711
02:58:22,140 --> 02:58:25,140
And thank you to our northern friends, Thingamy and Bob.

2712
02:58:25,140 --> 02:58:28,140
You're seeing as how this is a very special occasion,

2713
02:58:28,140 --> 02:58:31,140
and also as a thank you for the party they have decided to show us

2714
02:58:31,140 --> 02:58:33,140
what is in their suitcase,

2715
02:58:33,140 --> 02:58:36,140
and I'm sure you'll all be astounded by what you see.

2716
02:58:36,140 --> 02:58:38,140
Come closer, everyone.

2717
02:58:38,140 --> 02:58:41,140
Now, thingamy and Bob, are you ready?

2718
02:58:45,140 --> 02:58:47,140
Ready, everyone?

2719
02:58:47,140 --> 02:58:48,140
Ready, everyone?

2720
02:58:48,140 --> 02:58:50,140
One, two, three!

2721
02:58:50,140 --> 02:58:52,140
Ooh!

2722
02:58:54,140 --> 02:58:56,140
How wonderful!

2723
02:58:56,140 --> 02:59:00,140
I don't know how the globe could swap that for an old seashell.

2724
02:59:00,140 --> 02:59:05,140
Oh, I don't know how the globe could swap that for an old seashell.

2725
02:59:07,140 --> 02:59:11,140
By my, that must be the King's Ruby.

2726
02:59:26,140 --> 02:59:29,140
The King's Ruby. I found it.

2727
02:59:29,140 --> 02:59:31,140
It's the Hub Goblin!

2728
02:59:35,140 --> 02:59:38,140
Yes, this is it. The ruby I've sworn to find.

2729
02:59:40,140 --> 02:59:42,140
Don't touch it! It's ours!

2730
02:59:42,140 --> 02:59:44,140
Go away, you nasty Hub Goblin!

2731
02:59:44,140 --> 02:59:47,140
But that King's ruby belongs only to me!

2732
02:59:47,140 --> 02:59:54,140
No, it doesn't. The Groke gave it to sing-a-me-in-bob-in-fair exchange for a heart-shaped shell, Mr. Hub Goblin.

2733
02:59:54,140 --> 02:59:57,140
Did he say a heart-shaped shell?

2734
02:59:57,140 --> 02:59:59,140
I think so.

2735
02:59:59,140 --> 03:00:02,140
Anyway, I saw her give it to them with my own eyes.

2736
03:00:02,140 --> 03:00:04,140
Show it belongs to them, not you.

2737
03:00:04,140 --> 03:00:10,140
I've spent 300 years day and night searching everywhere for this ruby.

2738
03:00:10,140 --> 03:00:13,140
Well, that's very sad, but it still is.

2739
03:00:13,140 --> 03:00:19,140
Now then, let's see, would you exchange the ruby for, say, two diamond mines?

2740
03:00:19,140 --> 03:00:22,140
No! We don't mind anything else!

2741
03:00:28,140 --> 03:00:32,140
No, I can't do it. I can't take it by force.

2742
03:00:34,140 --> 03:00:37,140
It's been so long. What can I do?

2743
03:00:48,140 --> 03:00:52,140
Would you like some punch? It's very nice.

2744
03:00:53,140 --> 03:00:58,140
That's very kind of you, woman, mama. I haven't had any for 85 years.

2745
03:01:05,140 --> 03:01:07,140
Ah, quince.

2746
03:01:07,140 --> 03:01:11,140
That's part of it, Mr. Hub Goblin. Have some more, please.

2747
03:01:11,140 --> 03:01:14,140
No, thank you. Hub Goblins don't really drink very much.

2748
03:01:14,140 --> 03:01:18,140
Well, this is a splendid punch and a splendid party.

2749
03:01:18,140 --> 03:01:21,140
In return, I shall show you a little magic.

2750
03:01:21,140 --> 03:01:24,140
I will give out three presents.

2751
03:01:24,140 --> 03:01:30,140
Now what I can do is grant three wishes, so I want three of you to come forward and make a wish.

2752
03:01:30,140 --> 03:01:34,140
You're not afraid, are you?

2753
03:01:34,140 --> 03:01:39,140
How you look old enough not to be frightened, Mr. Emulane?

2754
03:01:39,140 --> 03:01:41,140
Just let me think.

2755
03:01:41,140 --> 03:01:46,140
Oh, yes, Mr. Hub Goblin. I broke the spade. I borrowed from woman, papa.

2756
03:01:47,140 --> 03:01:50,140
No, Mr. Emulane, never make a proper wish.

2757
03:01:50,140 --> 03:01:53,140
I would like a new spade, if you please.

2758
03:01:53,140 --> 03:01:55,140
Very well. Here you are.

2759
03:01:55,140 --> 03:02:00,140
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Hub Goblin.

2760
03:02:00,140 --> 03:02:02,140
Here you are, woman, papa.

2761
03:02:02,140 --> 03:02:04,140
Right. Who's next?

2762
03:02:04,140 --> 03:02:06,140
Excuse me?

2763
03:02:08,140 --> 03:02:11,140
Yes, and what can I do for you, young lady?

2764
03:02:11,140 --> 03:02:14,140
Well, I'm afraid it might be a little difficult.

2765
03:02:14,140 --> 03:02:17,140
Huh, for me?

2766
03:02:17,140 --> 03:02:19,140
Is that really what you want?

2767
03:02:19,140 --> 03:02:20,140
Please.

2768
03:02:20,140 --> 03:02:23,140
All right, then close your eyes.

2769
03:02:23,140 --> 03:02:28,140
Your wish has now come true, young lady.

2770
03:02:28,140 --> 03:02:29,140
Oh.

2771
03:02:29,140 --> 03:02:31,140
Oh, snorke-may.

2772
03:02:31,140 --> 03:02:33,140
Oh, snorke-may done.

2773
03:02:33,140 --> 03:02:37,140
I've wanted eyes like that wouldn't lay to you think it's so beautiful.

2774
03:02:37,140 --> 03:02:40,140
Do you think I'm beautiful now, woman?

2775
03:02:40,140 --> 03:02:44,140
Well, I, well, give me a mirror, someone.

2776
03:02:44,140 --> 03:02:47,140
They're quite nice, really.

2777
03:02:51,140 --> 03:02:53,140
Huh?

2778
03:02:53,140 --> 03:02:57,140
This is horrible, horrible.

2779
03:02:57,140 --> 03:03:01,140
Please, Mr. Hub Goblin, please give me my eyes back.

2780
03:03:01,140 --> 03:03:05,140
I'm sorry, but I can only grant one wish per person.

2781
03:03:05,140 --> 03:03:09,140
Oh, that's really me. No, please.

2782
03:03:09,140 --> 03:03:13,140
Mr. Hub Goblin, can I make a wish now?

2783
03:03:13,140 --> 03:03:18,140
Certainly. A golden chariot. A rock crystal goblet. Anything at all.

2784
03:03:18,140 --> 03:03:22,140
A sack full of gold coins. You can be rich, woman. Really rich.

2785
03:03:22,140 --> 03:03:25,140
I'm sorry, but movements is the last wish.

2786
03:03:25,140 --> 03:03:28,140
I know. Why don't you ask for two sackfuls of gold, woman?

2787
03:03:28,140 --> 03:03:31,140
Then we can have one each. What do you think?

2788
03:03:31,140 --> 03:03:34,140
No, sniff. I know what I'm going to wish.

2789
03:03:34,140 --> 03:03:35,140
Oh, man.

2790
03:03:35,140 --> 03:03:38,140
Mr. Hub Goblin, please change snorke-may done's eyes back to her own.

2791
03:03:38,140 --> 03:03:43,140
Never mind her, she can see all right. Get the gold coins.

2792
03:03:43,140 --> 03:03:47,140
The wish is made and fulfilled.

2793
03:03:49,140 --> 03:03:51,140
There you are. Have a look.

2794
03:03:51,140 --> 03:03:52,140
Oh.

2795
03:03:52,140 --> 03:03:56,140
The next time. Think before you make a wish.

2796
03:03:56,140 --> 03:03:58,140
Momen.

2797
03:04:00,140 --> 03:04:02,140
Mr. Hub Goblin.

2798
03:04:02,140 --> 03:04:04,140
Yes, think of me.

2799
03:04:04,140 --> 03:04:06,140
If you can grant wishes like that,

2800
03:04:06,140 --> 03:04:09,140
why don't you make a wish for yourself?

2801
03:04:09,140 --> 03:04:12,140
I'm afraid my magic only works for other people.

2802
03:04:12,140 --> 03:04:16,140
Mr. Hub Goblin, can we make a wish for you then? Please, there we can.

2803
03:04:16,140 --> 03:04:17,140
Please.

2804
03:04:17,140 --> 03:04:18,140
I suppose so.

2805
03:04:18,140 --> 03:04:20,140
Oh, please. It's important.

2806
03:04:20,140 --> 03:04:23,140
Very well, as it is not for you.

2807
03:04:23,140 --> 03:04:26,140
We wish for a movie just like yours.

2808
03:04:26,140 --> 03:04:28,140
You shall have it.

2809
03:04:29,140 --> 03:04:31,140
This is for you, Hub Goblin.

2810
03:04:31,140 --> 03:04:34,140
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

2811
03:04:34,140 --> 03:04:40,140
And so that was how, after three hundred years, the Hub Goblin search came to an end.

2812
03:04:40,140 --> 03:04:45,140
And Momen Valley had never had such a celebration.

2813
03:04:45,140 --> 03:04:47,140
Oh, thank you.

2814
03:04:47,140 --> 03:04:48,140
Thank you.

2815
03:04:48,140 --> 03:04:53,140
And so that was how, after three hundred years,

2816
03:04:53,140 --> 03:04:59,460
Goblin's search came to an end, and Moomin Valley had never had such a celebration.

2817
03:04:59,460 --> 03:05:06,460
Everyone was happy, except possibly Sniff, who would have quite liked a sack full of gold coins.

2818
03:05:23,140 --> 03:05:31,140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

2819
03:05:31,140 --> 03:05:35,140
They're always happy and always at play.

2820
03:05:35,140 --> 03:05:42,140
The Moomin's are having fun day after day. The Moomin's.

2821
03:05:42,140 --> 03:05:46,140
The Moomin's.

2822
03:05:46,140 --> 03:05:53,140
They love the laughter and they love the living the Moomin's.

2823
03:05:53,140 --> 03:06:01,140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.

2824
03:06:01,140 --> 03:06:04,140
They're always happy and always at play.

2825
03:06:04,140 --> 03:06:11,140
The Moomin's are having fun day after day. The Moomin's.

2826
03:06:11,140 --> 03:06:18,140
The Moomin's.

2827
03:06:18,140 --> 03:06:21,140
The Moomin's.

2828
03:06:41,140 --> 03:06:46,140
They are for one and all. The Moomin's are about to call.

2829
03:06:46,140 --> 03:06:54,140
Come on and sit down here with me. Therefore you are your TV. They are the Moomin's.

2830
03:06:54,140 --> 03:06:57,140
They are the Moomin's.

2831
03:06:57,140 --> 03:07:03,140
So come with me, give me your hand. I'll take you up to a Moomin land.

2832
03:07:03,140 --> 03:07:11,140
You can fly just like a bird. Sing that song ever. There were the Moomin's.

2833
03:07:11,140 --> 03:07:14,140
There were the Moomin's.

2834
03:07:14,140 --> 03:07:17,140
There were the Moomin's.

2835
03:07:17,140 --> 03:07:20,140
There were the Moomin's.

2836
03:07:20,140 --> 03:07:23,140
There were the Moomin's.

2837
03:07:23,140 --> 03:07:26,140
There were the Moomin's.

2838
03:07:33,140 --> 03:07:38,140
There were the Moomin's.

2839
03:07:38,140 --> 03:07:43,140
There were the Moomin's.

2840
03:07:43,140 --> 03:07:48,140
There were the Moomin's.

2841
03:07:48,140 --> 03:07:53,140
There were the Moomin's.

2842
03:07:53,140 --> 03:07:59,140
There were the Moomin's.

2843
03:07:59,140 --> 03:08:09,140
There were the Moomin's.

2844
03:08:09,140 --> 03:08:15,140
There were the Moomin's.

2845
03:08:15,140 --> 03:08:24,140
There were the Moomin's.

2846
03:08:24,140 --> 03:08:28,140
Come on, man. We're here already. This is Mum and House.

2847
03:08:31,140 --> 03:08:33,140
It has been raining since lunchtime,

2848
03:08:33,140 --> 03:08:37,140
and Mum and his friends had spent all afternoon in Mum and House,

2849
03:08:37,140 --> 03:08:39,140
waiting for the Sunday to come out.

2850
03:08:42,140 --> 03:08:46,140
So, Tutiki's arrival was very welcome.

2851
03:08:47,140 --> 03:08:50,140
Good evening, Mum and Tutiki. Come here.

2852
03:08:50,140 --> 03:08:51,140
Come in.

2853
03:08:53,140 --> 03:08:55,140
Mum, don't take his hair.

2854
03:08:55,140 --> 03:08:58,140
Come on in, Manny. A neat moment.

2855
03:09:01,140 --> 03:09:03,140
Is there someone with you?

2856
03:09:03,140 --> 03:09:05,140
Yes, I brought my friend, Manny.

2857
03:09:05,140 --> 03:09:06,140
Manny?

2858
03:09:06,140 --> 03:09:08,140
Don't be shy.

2859
03:09:09,140 --> 03:09:11,140
Well, there's no one there.

2860
03:09:11,140 --> 03:09:14,140
Yes, there is. You just can't see her.

2861
03:09:14,140 --> 03:09:15,140
Really?

2862
03:09:15,140 --> 03:09:18,140
Yes, I'm afraid she's very, very shy.

2863
03:09:19,140 --> 03:09:23,140
I'll leave the door open for you, Manny. Come in when you're ready.

2864
03:09:23,140 --> 03:09:26,140
She'll get soaked if she stays out there.

2865
03:09:26,140 --> 03:09:30,140
Maybe that doesn't matter very much if you're invisible.

2866
03:09:33,140 --> 03:09:36,140
Tutiki, how nice.

2867
03:09:38,140 --> 03:09:41,140
What is everyone looking at?

2868
03:09:42,140 --> 03:09:46,140
A bad Nanny.

2869
03:09:46,140 --> 03:09:50,140
You know, sometimes when people are very frightened,

2870
03:09:50,140 --> 03:09:53,140
they can become invisible to the people around them.

2871
03:09:54,140 --> 03:09:55,140
Poor Nanny.

2872
03:09:55,140 --> 03:09:58,140
She's looked after by an aunt who doesn't like her,

2873
03:09:58,140 --> 03:10:00,140
and is really horrible to her,

2874
03:10:00,140 --> 03:10:03,140
and who only does it because she thinks it's her duty.

2875
03:10:03,140 --> 03:10:07,140
It wouldn't be so bad if she just got mad and yelled at her,

2876
03:10:07,140 --> 03:10:10,140
but she's cold and sarcastic, which is much worse.

2877
03:10:10,140 --> 03:10:13,140
She doesn't care if Nanny is unhappy,

2878
03:10:13,140 --> 03:10:15,140
and gives her horrible jobs.

2879
03:10:15,140 --> 03:10:17,140
What's sarcastic?

2880
03:10:17,140 --> 03:10:19,140
Uh, let's see.

2881
03:10:19,140 --> 03:10:21,140
Suppose you tripped and fell over.

2882
03:10:21,140 --> 03:10:23,140
What would Mum and Mama say?

2883
03:10:24,140 --> 03:10:26,140
Well, she'd ask me if I'd hurt myself.

2884
03:10:26,140 --> 03:10:29,140
Yes, well, you're lucky that Mum and Mama is so nice,

2885
03:10:29,140 --> 03:10:32,140
but a lot of people would be mad at you.

2886
03:10:32,140 --> 03:10:34,140
Now, this nasty old lady would say

2887
03:10:34,140 --> 03:10:36,140
that maybe you're right dear of dancing,

2888
03:10:36,140 --> 03:10:39,140
but try not to do it when people are eaten, please.

2889
03:10:39,140 --> 03:10:41,140
Gosh, that's horrible.

2890
03:10:41,140 --> 03:10:45,140
Anyway, she just went on being more and more horrible to her,

2891
03:10:45,140 --> 03:10:48,140
so that in the end, Nanny was so upset.

2892
03:10:48,140 --> 03:10:50,140
She became invisible,

2893
03:10:50,140 --> 03:10:52,140
and our aunt said she couldn't be bothered

2894
03:10:52,140 --> 03:10:54,140
to look after little girl she couldn't see.

2895
03:10:54,140 --> 03:10:56,140
Poor Nanny.

2896
03:10:57,140 --> 03:10:59,140
So she asked me to do it.

2897
03:10:59,140 --> 03:11:01,140
Nanny's still outside.

2898
03:11:01,140 --> 03:11:03,140
Too nervous to come in.

2899
03:11:05,140 --> 03:11:07,140
What did you do to this old aunt?

2900
03:11:07,140 --> 03:11:10,140
I hope you told her she heard Nanny's feelings.

2901
03:11:10,140 --> 03:11:13,140
She wouldn't have done any good, not with someone like her.

2902
03:11:14,140 --> 03:11:16,140
So I took Nanny home,

2903
03:11:16,140 --> 03:11:18,140
and then as you're the nicest family I know,

2904
03:11:18,140 --> 03:11:21,140
I brought her here so you could make her visible again.

2905
03:11:21,140 --> 03:11:24,140
You were very flattered, of course, too, Tiki, but...

2906
03:11:24,140 --> 03:11:27,140
If anyone can do it, you and Mum and Mama can,

2907
03:11:27,140 --> 03:11:29,140
and Mum can play with her.

2908
03:11:29,140 --> 03:11:31,140
Does she talk at all to Tiki?

2909
03:11:31,140 --> 03:11:32,140
I'm afraid not.

2910
03:11:32,140 --> 03:11:34,140
Not since she became invisible.

2911
03:11:34,140 --> 03:11:35,140
Oh, dear.

2912
03:11:36,140 --> 03:11:38,140
I'm sure I can think of lots of games,

2913
03:11:38,140 --> 03:11:41,140
but it'll be hard to play if I can't see her.

2914
03:11:41,140 --> 03:11:43,140
She'll be really good at hiding seat, though.

2915
03:11:43,140 --> 03:11:45,140
Oh, it's okay.

2916
03:11:45,140 --> 03:11:49,140
You know where she is because her aunt hung a little bell around her neck.

2917
03:11:54,140 --> 03:11:56,140
Oh, look, the door's opened.

2918
03:11:56,140 --> 03:11:58,140
That'll be Nanny.

2919
03:12:02,140 --> 03:12:04,140
Come in, Nanny.

2920
03:12:04,140 --> 03:12:07,140
All right, don't be frightened.

2921
03:12:07,140 --> 03:12:09,140
Come and meet everyone.

2922
03:12:09,140 --> 03:12:11,140
This is your new home,

2923
03:12:11,140 --> 03:12:14,140
and this is Mum and Mama and Mum and Papa.

2924
03:12:14,140 --> 03:12:16,140
They're both very nice.

2925
03:12:16,140 --> 03:12:19,140
Hello, I'm Mum and these are my friends.

2926
03:12:22,140 --> 03:12:24,140
We were just having some tea.

2927
03:12:24,140 --> 03:12:25,140
Would you like some?

2928
03:12:25,140 --> 03:12:28,140
Oh, that is, if you can drink.

2929
03:12:28,140 --> 03:12:32,140
Oh, perhaps I should make some lemonade.

2930
03:12:33,140 --> 03:12:37,140
Well, now, perhaps you'd all like to go back to the table.

2931
03:12:37,140 --> 03:12:40,140
If you'd care to sit down, Nanny.

2932
03:12:44,140 --> 03:12:47,140
I'm sorry I don't know any more about her,

2933
03:12:47,140 --> 03:12:50,140
but I'm sure that everything will be okay now she's here.

2934
03:12:50,140 --> 03:12:53,140
I'm certain it will.

2935
03:12:53,140 --> 03:12:55,140
We'll do our best, Tiki.

2936
03:12:57,140 --> 03:12:59,140
Here you are, Nanny.

2937
03:13:03,140 --> 03:13:07,140
Well, she seems to be okay now,

2938
03:13:07,140 --> 03:13:09,140
so I'd better be getting along.

2939
03:13:09,140 --> 03:13:11,140
I've got a lot of things to do.

2940
03:13:11,140 --> 03:13:15,140
I'll try and come over to see how you're all going.

2941
03:13:15,140 --> 03:13:18,140
That would really be nice.

2942
03:13:20,140 --> 03:13:22,140
Oh, that's a better.

2943
03:13:22,140 --> 03:13:24,140
You have got room, haven't you?

2944
03:13:24,140 --> 03:13:27,140
Didn't you have someone else stand?

2945
03:13:27,140 --> 03:13:32,140
Oh, yes, thing I mean Bob, but it's alright, they left last week.

2946
03:13:32,140 --> 03:13:34,140
That's okay then.

2947
03:13:38,140 --> 03:13:41,140
Oh, you must have been thirsty.

2948
03:13:41,140 --> 03:13:44,140
Would you like some more?

2949
03:13:44,140 --> 03:13:46,140
Sure.

2950
03:13:58,140 --> 03:14:02,140
Oh, are you coming up with me?

2951
03:14:02,140 --> 03:14:05,140
That's nice, Nanny.

2952
03:14:13,140 --> 03:14:16,140
This is your very own room.

2953
03:14:16,140 --> 03:14:20,140
You'll be warm and cozy here.

2954
03:14:20,140 --> 03:14:22,140
I've put the lemonade on the table,

2955
03:14:22,140 --> 03:14:26,140
so you can have a drink whenever you want.

2956
03:14:26,140 --> 03:14:30,140
Are you sure you wouldn't like something to eat?

2957
03:14:30,140 --> 03:14:33,140
Ah, I see, you want to go to bed.

2958
03:14:33,140 --> 03:14:37,140
Well, you had a busy day, so you must be tired out.

2959
03:14:37,140 --> 03:14:40,140
Don't forget, if you feel frightened or lonely during the night,

2960
03:14:40,140 --> 03:14:43,140
just come and wake me up and we'll have a talk.

2961
03:14:43,140 --> 03:14:46,140
If you like, you can tinkle your little bell in my ear,

2962
03:14:46,140 --> 03:14:50,140
and that should do it, many dear.

2963
03:14:50,140 --> 03:14:54,140
Sweet dreams, sleep well.

2964
03:14:57,140 --> 03:14:59,140
She asleep?

2965
03:14:59,140 --> 03:15:02,140
Yes.

2966
03:15:02,140 --> 03:15:06,140
I was wondering whether there's anything that might help her

2967
03:15:06,140 --> 03:15:09,140
in your granny's book of household remedies.

2968
03:15:09,140 --> 03:15:12,140
I don't know if there's a cure for invisibility.

2969
03:15:12,140 --> 03:15:14,140
I can't remember, but I'll have a look.

2970
03:15:14,140 --> 03:15:16,140
There's a remedy for most things.

2971
03:15:16,140 --> 03:15:18,140
I'm a phone believer in granny's remedy.

2972
03:15:18,140 --> 03:15:20,140
I know you are dear.

2973
03:15:20,140 --> 03:15:22,140
I'll go and see.

2974
03:15:22,140 --> 03:15:25,140
I wonder what you looked like.

2975
03:15:25,140 --> 03:15:28,140
Hmm.

2976
03:15:28,140 --> 03:15:31,140
Hmm.

2977
03:15:31,140 --> 03:15:34,140
Ah, there it is.

2978
03:15:34,140 --> 03:15:39,140
Now then, a droopy tail, evil eye, melancholy.

2979
03:15:39,140 --> 03:15:43,140
Ah, this must be it.

2980
03:15:43,140 --> 03:15:46,140
Ah, this must be it.

2981
03:15:58,140 --> 03:16:02,140
The prescription was at the end of the book and shakily written,

2982
03:16:02,140 --> 03:16:04,140
but it looked like the right one.

2983
03:16:04,140 --> 03:16:08,140
It said, remedy for when people start getting misty

2984
03:16:08,140 --> 03:16:11,140
and difficult to see.

2985
03:16:11,140 --> 03:16:14,140
It was very complicated.

2986
03:16:29,140 --> 03:16:32,140
Do you think it's going to work, Mama?

2987
03:16:32,140 --> 03:16:35,140
Granny's remedies usually do, so don't worry.

2988
03:16:35,140 --> 03:16:37,140
Yes, you're right.

2989
03:16:37,140 --> 03:16:40,140
I wonder whether we ought to go and wake her up.

2990
03:16:57,140 --> 03:17:00,140
Look, you can see many shoes.

2991
03:17:08,140 --> 03:17:11,140
Papa!

2992
03:17:11,140 --> 03:17:13,140
Papa!

2993
03:17:13,140 --> 03:17:15,140
Good morning, little Mai.

2994
03:17:15,140 --> 03:17:17,140
Is Ninny up yet?

2995
03:17:17,140 --> 03:17:19,140
Yes, she is.

2996
03:17:19,140 --> 03:17:22,140
Where is she? She hasn't eaten yet, has she?

2997
03:17:22,140 --> 03:17:25,140
I don't know, and she's probably at the dining room.

2998
03:17:25,140 --> 03:17:28,140
Oh, no!

2999
03:17:34,140 --> 03:17:36,140
I'm too late!

3000
03:17:36,140 --> 03:17:39,140
She'd be quiet, you two.

3001
03:17:39,140 --> 03:17:42,140
Ninny's just finishing her breakfast.

3002
03:17:42,140 --> 03:17:45,140
Come on, drink it all up.

3003
03:17:45,140 --> 03:17:48,140
That's good.

3004
03:17:48,140 --> 03:17:50,140
It should start to work in a couple of hours.

3005
03:17:50,140 --> 03:17:52,140
Well done, Ninny.

3006
03:17:52,140 --> 03:17:54,140
Look, her shoes are floating!

3007
03:17:54,140 --> 03:17:58,140
Yeah, and soon we'll be seeing the rest of her.

3008
03:17:58,140 --> 03:18:00,140
Ha, they look silly.

3009
03:18:00,140 --> 03:18:02,140
I think they're very nice feet.

3010
03:18:02,140 --> 03:18:04,140
I know women, Mama's remedies are good,

3011
03:18:04,140 --> 03:18:06,140
I can't see them working that fast.

3012
03:18:06,140 --> 03:18:10,140
Anyway, you must look pretty bad if you want to make yourself invisible.

3013
03:18:10,140 --> 03:18:12,140
Don't let little Mai upset you, Ninny.

3014
03:18:12,140 --> 03:18:14,140
It's only the way she talks.

3015
03:18:14,140 --> 03:18:16,140
She doesn't mean it.

3016
03:18:16,140 --> 03:18:18,140
Oh, yes, I do.

3017
03:18:18,140 --> 03:18:20,140
I'm bored, Moomin.

3018
03:18:20,140 --> 03:18:22,140
Well, what shall we do then, Moomin?

3019
03:18:22,140 --> 03:18:24,140
I don't know.

3020
03:18:24,140 --> 03:18:26,140
Let's go mushroom picking.

3021
03:18:26,140 --> 03:18:28,140
That's boring, I never find any.

3022
03:18:28,140 --> 03:18:30,140
Well, I do.

3023
03:18:30,140 --> 03:18:32,140
Would you like to come, Ninny?

3024
03:18:32,140 --> 03:18:34,140
You can pick the most, shall we?

3025
03:18:34,140 --> 03:18:36,140
They all look the same to me,

3026
03:18:36,140 --> 03:18:40,140
so you'll have to tell me which ones are safe to eat.

3027
03:18:42,140 --> 03:18:44,140
I'll tell you.

3028
03:18:56,140 --> 03:18:58,140
Papa! Papa!

3029
03:18:58,140 --> 03:19:01,140
Look, Papa, you can see many shoes now.

3030
03:19:01,140 --> 03:19:05,140
Oh, that's good. There's not many things Mama's potions won't cure.

3031
03:19:05,140 --> 03:19:07,140
Oh, it can't be that. She only took it a minute ago.

3032
03:19:07,140 --> 03:19:11,140
Well, it might be that it works faster if you're completely invisible.

3033
03:19:11,140 --> 03:19:13,140
I think it's being away from that horrid out.

3034
03:19:13,140 --> 03:19:15,140
Yes, it could be.

3035
03:19:15,140 --> 03:19:19,140
Mama, we're taking Ninny mushroom picking.

3036
03:19:19,140 --> 03:19:21,140
Have a nice time.

3037
03:19:21,140 --> 03:19:23,140
Morning!

3038
03:19:23,140 --> 03:19:25,140
Morning!

3039
03:19:25,140 --> 03:19:27,140
Hello.

3040
03:19:27,140 --> 03:19:29,140
Where's Ninny?

3041
03:19:31,140 --> 03:19:33,140
Ah!

3042
03:19:33,140 --> 03:19:35,140
Ah!

3043
03:19:35,140 --> 03:19:37,140
Ah!

3044
03:19:37,140 --> 03:19:39,140
Ah!

3045
03:19:39,140 --> 03:19:41,140
Wow, what a lot of mushrooms!

3046
03:19:41,140 --> 03:19:43,140
Ah!

3047
03:19:43,140 --> 03:19:45,140
Ah!

3048
03:19:45,140 --> 03:19:47,140
Ah!

3049
03:19:47,140 --> 03:19:49,140
Ah!

3050
03:19:49,140 --> 03:19:51,140
Ah!

3051
03:19:51,140 --> 03:19:53,140
Ah!

3052
03:19:53,140 --> 03:19:57,140
Wow, what a lot of mushrooms!

3053
03:19:57,140 --> 03:20:07,140
You seem to know where to find all the best ones, Ninny.

3054
03:20:07,140 --> 03:20:11,140
It's so fair. I haven't gotten half as many.

3055
03:20:11,140 --> 03:20:13,140
How are you doing, Momen?

3056
03:20:13,140 --> 03:20:15,140
Ah!

3057
03:20:15,140 --> 03:20:19,140
Wow, that must be about four times as many as I've got.

3058
03:20:19,140 --> 03:20:21,140
Uh, yeah, that's right.

3059
03:20:21,140 --> 03:20:25,140
You've never picked that many before.

3060
03:20:25,140 --> 03:20:29,140
You know, Momen, I think there's something fishy about this.

3061
03:20:31,140 --> 03:20:34,140
Uh-huh, so they're not yours at all.

3062
03:20:34,140 --> 03:20:37,140
Well, not really, no.

3063
03:20:37,140 --> 03:20:40,140
Ninny's enjoyed herself.

3064
03:20:40,140 --> 03:20:43,140
I'd better yak you old ant never let her go mushroom picking.

3065
03:20:43,140 --> 03:20:47,140
She was probably only allowed to carry the baskets, the really heavy ones.

3066
03:20:47,140 --> 03:20:51,140
Oh, how awful for her.

3067
03:20:51,140 --> 03:20:55,140
They're stinky.

3068
03:20:55,140 --> 03:20:57,140
What's he up to now?

3069
03:20:57,140 --> 03:20:59,140
I'll take care of him.

3070
03:20:59,140 --> 03:21:01,140
Hello, Momen, long time no see.

3071
03:21:01,140 --> 03:21:03,140
Not long enough.

3072
03:21:03,140 --> 03:21:05,140
Last time you dipped my swimming shorts in glue.

3073
03:21:05,140 --> 03:21:08,140
You know, I thought that was very funny.

3074
03:21:08,140 --> 03:21:11,140
Hey, what's that basket floating around up there for?

3075
03:21:11,140 --> 03:21:14,140
I don't want to be rude, but mind your own business.

3076
03:21:14,140 --> 03:21:16,140
It looks like the Hobgoblins work.

3077
03:21:16,140 --> 03:21:19,140
Boy, just think of all the things you could do if you were invisible.

3078
03:21:20,140 --> 03:21:22,140
Ninny, I'll carry your basket.

3079
03:21:22,140 --> 03:21:23,140
Let's go.

3080
03:21:23,140 --> 03:21:26,140
It stinks here.

3081
03:21:26,140 --> 03:21:28,140
Hey, you.

3082
03:21:28,140 --> 03:21:30,140
Isn't it me a name or just a description?

3083
03:21:30,140 --> 03:21:31,140
What's wrong?

3084
03:21:31,140 --> 03:21:33,140
Is your voice invisible, too?

3085
03:21:33,140 --> 03:21:35,140
Please stop it, stinky.

3086
03:21:35,140 --> 03:21:37,140
Can't you see you're frightening her?

3087
03:21:37,140 --> 03:21:39,140
Oh, it's a girl, is it?

3088
03:21:39,140 --> 03:21:40,140
Why doesn't she speak for herself?

3089
03:21:40,140 --> 03:21:41,140
And she's stupid.

3090
03:21:41,140 --> 03:21:44,140
What a perfect name for her, Ninny.

3091
03:21:44,140 --> 03:21:46,140
Now look, stinky.

3092
03:21:46,140 --> 03:21:48,140
Oh, yes, Momen, now look what?

3093
03:21:48,140 --> 03:21:52,140
You stop upsetting Ninny or I'll get really angry.

3094
03:21:52,140 --> 03:21:55,140
Without those feet she'd be perfect for a bank robbery.

3095
03:21:55,140 --> 03:21:59,140
Well, she's getting visible again, so she'll be no good to you at all, stinky.

3096
03:21:59,140 --> 03:22:01,140
You couldn't see any of her yesterday.

3097
03:22:01,140 --> 03:22:03,140
Not even the feet.

3098
03:22:03,140 --> 03:22:04,140
Oh, oh.

3099
03:22:04,140 --> 03:22:05,140
They're disappearing again.

3100
03:22:05,140 --> 03:22:09,140
Mom, you have to do a scare of it.

3101
03:22:09,140 --> 03:22:12,140
Oh, see, she's gone.

3102
03:22:12,140 --> 03:22:14,140
It's all your fault, stinky.

3103
03:22:14,140 --> 03:22:18,140
Yes, it's like I told you before she'd make a brilliant bank robbery.

3104
03:22:18,140 --> 03:22:20,140
Don't you agree?

3105
03:22:20,140 --> 03:22:21,140
Perfect.

3106
03:22:21,140 --> 03:22:25,140
Ninny would never do such a thing as that.

3107
03:22:25,140 --> 03:22:28,140
And anyway, Mom is given her one of Granny's magic remedies.

3108
03:22:28,140 --> 03:22:31,140
She'll soon be visible again, so they're there.

3109
03:22:39,140 --> 03:22:41,140
Whose basket is this?

3110
03:22:41,140 --> 03:22:43,140
Mine in little mice.

3111
03:22:43,140 --> 03:22:46,140
Well, there's not many of them, but they certainly are pretty.

3112
03:22:46,140 --> 03:22:49,140
There weren't many left for us to get.

3113
03:22:49,140 --> 03:22:51,140
Because Ninny has picked them all.

3114
03:22:51,140 --> 03:22:55,140
It doesn't really matter how many you've got, because you can't eat them.

3115
03:22:55,140 --> 03:22:57,140
Let me show you.

3116
03:22:57,140 --> 03:23:00,140
Now, this is deadly, tufted toad stool.

3117
03:23:00,140 --> 03:23:02,140
And this is cow's vein.

3118
03:23:02,140 --> 03:23:05,140
You must remember what they look like.

3119
03:23:05,140 --> 03:23:08,140
Ah, these are movements and sniff I should think.

3120
03:23:08,140 --> 03:23:10,140
We didn't pick any poisonous ones.

3121
03:23:10,140 --> 03:23:13,140
Not quite as many as Snork Maiden and Little My,

3122
03:23:13,140 --> 03:23:17,140
but this is body flybane and insiduous pepper spunk.

3123
03:23:17,140 --> 03:23:19,140
And you've both got cow's vein, too.

3124
03:23:19,140 --> 03:23:21,140
You must be more careful.

3125
03:23:21,140 --> 03:23:22,140
Now, this is better.

3126
03:23:22,140 --> 03:23:25,140
There's not one mushroom in here that you can't eat.

3127
03:23:25,140 --> 03:23:28,140
How did Ninny manage to do this all on her own?

3128
03:23:28,140 --> 03:23:30,140
What a very clever girl she is.

3129
03:23:30,140 --> 03:23:32,140
Ninny, where are you?

3130
03:23:32,140 --> 03:23:34,140
Come here a minute.

3131
03:23:34,140 --> 03:23:36,140
Ninny, didn't you hear?

3132
03:23:36,140 --> 03:23:38,140
Mama wants you.

3133
03:23:40,140 --> 03:23:43,140
Ninny, this is a beautiful mushroom basket.

3134
03:23:43,140 --> 03:23:46,140
We'll have a feast tonight.

3135
03:23:46,140 --> 03:23:49,140
Her feet have come back.

3136
03:23:49,140 --> 03:23:51,140
Oh, I'm so glad.

3137
03:23:51,140 --> 03:23:54,140
We'll soon be able to see your face.

3138
03:23:54,140 --> 03:23:56,140
It won't take long at all, Ninny.

3139
03:23:56,140 --> 03:23:58,140
And you mustn't worry about stinky one little bit.

3140
03:23:58,140 --> 03:24:00,140
He's all talk.

3141
03:24:00,140 --> 03:24:03,140
If something upsets you, just think of something else.

3142
03:24:03,140 --> 03:24:06,140
At least that's my philosophy in life.

3143
03:24:07,140 --> 03:24:09,140
If somebody upsets you, ignore him.

3144
03:24:09,140 --> 03:24:11,140
That's my philosophy, Ninny.

3145
03:24:11,140 --> 03:24:14,140
Anyone who picks mushrooms like this deserves to be seen.

3146
03:24:14,140 --> 03:24:17,140
You mustn't let anything frighten you when you're with us.

3147
03:24:17,140 --> 03:24:19,140
Do you understand?

3148
03:24:22,140 --> 03:24:25,140
Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.

3149
03:24:25,140 --> 03:24:27,140
That's just great, Ninny.

3150
03:24:27,140 --> 03:24:29,140
Oh, that's wonderful, Ninny, wonderful.

3151
03:24:29,140 --> 03:24:32,140
I can't wait to see all of you.

3152
03:24:32,140 --> 03:24:34,140
It won't be long now.

3153
03:24:34,140 --> 03:24:37,140
I don't think Mouse Gray is quite your color, you know.

3154
03:24:55,140 --> 03:24:57,140
You just sleep as long as you like, Ninny.

3155
03:24:57,140 --> 03:24:58,140
Good night now.

3156
03:24:58,140 --> 03:25:01,140
If you want anything, you just shout.

3157
03:25:04,140 --> 03:25:05,140
Good night.

3158
03:25:05,140 --> 03:25:06,140
Good night.

3159
03:25:06,140 --> 03:25:07,140
Good night.

3160
03:25:07,140 --> 03:25:08,140
Good night.

3161
03:25:08,140 --> 03:25:09,140
Good night.

3162
03:25:09,140 --> 03:25:10,140
Good night.

3163
03:25:10,140 --> 03:25:11,140
Good night.

3164
03:25:11,140 --> 03:25:12,140
Good night.

3165
03:25:12,140 --> 03:25:13,140
Good night.

3166
03:25:13,140 --> 03:25:14,140
Good night.

3167
03:25:14,140 --> 03:25:15,140
Good night.

3168
03:25:15,140 --> 03:25:16,140
Good night.

3169
03:25:16,140 --> 03:25:17,140
Good night.

3170
03:25:17,140 --> 03:25:18,140
Good night.

3171
03:25:18,140 --> 03:25:19,140
Good night.

3172
03:25:19,140 --> 03:25:20,140
Good night.

3173
03:25:20,140 --> 03:25:21,140
Good night.

3174
03:25:21,140 --> 03:25:31,140
Uh...

3175
03:25:31,140 --> 03:25:33,140
Oh.

3176
03:25:33,140 --> 03:25:35,140
Oh.

3177
03:25:35,140 --> 03:25:36,140
Oh.

3178
03:25:36,140 --> 03:25:38,140
Oh.

3179
03:25:38,140 --> 03:25:42,140
Oh, where's Mom and Momma?

3180
03:25:42,140 --> 03:25:55,140
Well, well. What are you doing? Do you know what time it is?

3181
03:25:55,140 --> 03:26:01,140
Do you like this moment, Papa? Yes, it's very nice.

3182
03:26:01,140 --> 03:26:06,140
It's good to have someone in the house to make clothes for it last. I hope it'll look pretty on her.

3183
03:26:06,140 --> 03:26:09,140
What's this for? Her hair!

3184
03:26:12,140 --> 03:26:17,140
Good morning, Moomin, Papa.

3185
03:26:17,140 --> 03:26:19,140
Good morning, Lila.

3186
03:26:19,140 --> 03:26:22,140
I'm coming.

3187
03:26:22,140 --> 03:26:25,140
I'm coming.

3188
03:26:25,140 --> 03:26:27,140
I'm coming.

3189
03:26:27,140 --> 03:26:30,140
I'm coming.

3190
03:26:30,140 --> 03:26:33,140
I'm coming.

3191
03:26:33,140 --> 03:26:36,140
I'm coming.

3192
03:26:36,140 --> 03:26:40,140
Good morning, Papa.

3193
03:26:40,140 --> 03:26:42,140
Good morning, Moomin, Papa.

3194
03:26:42,140 --> 03:26:45,140
Good morning, Little Mai. You're very early today. Where's Nini?

3195
03:26:45,140 --> 03:26:47,140
Still in bed.

3196
03:26:47,140 --> 03:26:49,140
You're up early.

3197
03:26:49,140 --> 03:26:54,140
I can't wait to see her. Come on, man.

3198
03:26:58,140 --> 03:27:01,140
It's like waiting for Christmas, isn't it?

3199
03:27:01,140 --> 03:27:05,140
Yeah, I like having Christmas every day. Isn't it, Papa?

3200
03:27:05,140 --> 03:27:12,140
Well, I think it's much more exciting this way. We have to wait until she's ready to come down.

3201
03:27:12,140 --> 03:27:18,140
Did you hear that door opening? She's awake.

3202
03:27:18,140 --> 03:27:23,140
I hope she found the dress where I left it on the table.

3203
03:27:36,140 --> 03:27:42,140
Oh, good. It's all right. Now you know where to look.

3204
03:27:42,140 --> 03:27:48,140
Well, she's OK, I suppose.

3205
03:27:48,140 --> 03:27:53,140
Thank you all very much for everything.

3206
03:27:53,140 --> 03:27:58,140
Oh. So she can talk.

3207
03:27:58,140 --> 03:28:05,140
They still couldn't see Nini's face, but at least they knew that she was there, and that she was talking to them.

3208
03:28:05,140 --> 03:28:07,140
It made them all feel a lot better.

3209
03:28:07,140 --> 03:28:10,140
It made them look.

3210
03:28:10,140 --> 03:28:13,140
It made them look better.

3211
03:28:13,140 --> 03:28:18,140
It made them look better.

3212
03:28:18,140 --> 03:28:23,140
It made them look better.

3213
03:28:23,140 --> 03:28:42,140
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.

3214
03:28:42,140 --> 03:28:50,140
Believing in sharing and caring, and giving the movements.

3215
03:28:50,140 --> 03:28:54,140
They're always happy and always at play.

3216
03:28:54,140 --> 03:28:57,140
The movements are having fun day after day.

3217
03:28:57,140 --> 03:29:01,140
The movements.

3218
03:29:01,140 --> 03:29:05,140
The movements.

3219
03:29:05,140 --> 03:29:12,140
They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.

3220
03:29:12,140 --> 03:29:19,140
Believing in sharing and caring, and giving the movements.

3221
03:29:19,140 --> 03:29:23,140
They're always happy and always at play.

3222
03:29:23,140 --> 03:29:26,140
The movements are having fun day after day.

3223
03:29:26,140 --> 03:29:30,140
The movements.

3224
03:29:30,140 --> 03:29:34,140
The movements.

3225
03:29:34,140 --> 03:29:39,140
The movements.

3226
03:29:49,140 --> 03:30:01,140
Here they are for one and all.

3227
03:30:01,140 --> 03:30:04,140
The movements are about to come.

3228
03:30:04,140 --> 03:30:07,140
Come on and sit down here with me.

3229
03:30:07,140 --> 03:30:10,140
They're here for you on your TV.

3230
03:30:10,140 --> 03:30:13,140
They are the movements.

3231
03:30:13,140 --> 03:30:16,140
They are the movements.

3232
03:30:16,140 --> 03:30:19,140
Come with me, give me your hand.

3233
03:30:19,140 --> 03:30:22,140
I'll take you up to a movement land.

3234
03:30:22,140 --> 03:30:25,140
You can fly just like a bird.

3235
03:30:25,140 --> 03:30:27,140
Sing that song ever.

3236
03:30:27,140 --> 03:30:30,140
There were the movements.

3237
03:30:30,140 --> 03:30:33,140
There were the movements.

3238
03:30:33,140 --> 03:30:36,140
There were the movements.

3239
03:30:36,140 --> 03:30:39,140
There were the movements.

3240
03:30:39,140 --> 03:30:42,140
There were the movements.

3241
03:30:42,140 --> 03:30:45,140
There were the movements.

3242
03:30:45,140 --> 03:30:48,140
There were the movements.

3243
03:30:48,140 --> 03:30:51,140
There were the movements.

3244
03:30:51,140 --> 03:30:55,140
There were the movements.

3245
03:30:55,140 --> 03:30:59,140
There were the movements.

3246
03:30:59,140 --> 03:31:03,140
There were the movements.

3247
03:31:03,140 --> 03:31:07,140
There were the movements.

3248
03:31:07,140 --> 03:31:11,140
There were the movements.

3249
03:31:11,140 --> 03:31:20,140
There were the movements.

3250
03:31:35,140 --> 03:31:38,140
They can't catch me.

3251
03:31:38,140 --> 03:31:40,140
Hey, oh, miss me!

3252
03:31:43,140 --> 03:31:45,140
Hey, where's Danny?

3253
03:31:45,140 --> 03:31:49,140
I asked her if she wanted to play with us, and she said yes!

3254
03:31:51,140 --> 03:31:55,140
Danny, come on, we're going to have some fun!

3255
03:32:08,140 --> 03:32:10,140
Right, let's go!

3256
03:32:13,140 --> 03:32:19,140
Ninny, who became invisible because of her sarcastic aunt, was now visible up to the neck.

3257
03:32:19,140 --> 03:32:24,140
But no matter how much of Granny's remedy she took or how nice the movements were to her,

3258
03:32:24,140 --> 03:32:27,140
her head still remained invisible.

3259
03:32:39,140 --> 03:32:41,140
That's the invisible child.

3260
03:32:41,140 --> 03:32:44,140
I wonder what she really looks like.

3261
03:32:44,140 --> 03:32:47,140
Oh, well, good morning, everybody!

3262
03:32:47,140 --> 03:32:51,140
Morning, lazy bones! We've been up for hours and hours!

3263
03:32:51,140 --> 03:32:53,140
We're going to play hide-and-seek in the woods.

3264
03:32:53,140 --> 03:32:56,140
Great! Ninny, are you all right?

3265
03:32:56,140 --> 03:32:58,140
Yes, thanks.

3266
03:32:58,140 --> 03:33:02,140
This is dumb. If I could see your face, I wouldn't have to ask.

3267
03:33:02,140 --> 03:33:06,140
Doesn't help with you, Sniff. You always ask silly questions.

3268
03:33:09,140 --> 03:33:12,140
It's a bit big for hide-and-seek, isn't it?

3269
03:33:12,140 --> 03:33:14,140
But that's what's so good about it!

3270
03:33:15,140 --> 03:33:20,140
It's a bit big for hide-and-seek, isn't it?

3271
03:33:20,140 --> 03:33:23,140
But that's what's so good about it!

3272
03:33:35,140 --> 03:33:39,140
Okay, this is a good place to start, but we've got a new rule for the game.

3273
03:33:40,140 --> 03:33:43,140
Once you found somewhere to hide, you've got to stay in the same place,

3274
03:33:43,140 --> 03:33:45,140
no moving about anyone.

3275
03:33:45,140 --> 03:33:48,140
Do you understand, Ninny?

3276
03:33:48,140 --> 03:33:50,140
Right, you're to go first, Sniff.

3277
03:33:50,140 --> 03:33:52,140
Why isn't always me first?

3278
03:33:52,140 --> 03:33:54,140
We'll have a practice for Ninny's sake.

3279
03:33:54,140 --> 03:33:56,140
Show her what to do.

3280
03:33:56,140 --> 03:33:58,140
Uh, hide-and-seek is an easy game.

3281
03:33:58,140 --> 03:34:01,140
Not for Ninny, it isn't. She's never played it before.

3282
03:34:01,140 --> 03:34:03,140
What? Never ever?

3283
03:34:03,140 --> 03:34:05,140
No, and not just hide-and-seek.

3284
03:34:05,140 --> 03:34:07,140
She hasn't played any games at all.

3285
03:34:07,140 --> 03:34:09,140
Not even when she was visible?

3286
03:34:09,140 --> 03:34:10,140
No, nothing.

3287
03:34:10,140 --> 03:34:12,140
Oh, that's terrible.

3288
03:34:12,140 --> 03:34:13,140
So, will you go first?

3289
03:34:13,140 --> 03:34:15,140
No, I won't.

3290
03:34:15,140 --> 03:34:17,140
Okay, I'll go first then.

3291
03:34:17,140 --> 03:34:22,140
I'll count to 10 slowly, so you'll have plenty of time to find somewhere.

3292
03:34:22,140 --> 03:34:26,140
One, two, three.

3293
03:34:29,140 --> 03:34:32,140
Go on, Ninny, hurry up.

3294
03:34:32,140 --> 03:34:36,140
Four, five.

3295
03:34:36,140 --> 03:34:43,140
I can still see you.

3296
03:34:43,140 --> 03:34:46,140
Six.

3297
03:34:50,140 --> 03:34:53,140
Seven.

3298
03:34:53,140 --> 03:34:55,140
Good, good, good.

3299
03:34:55,140 --> 03:34:57,140
Eight.

3300
03:35:00,140 --> 03:35:03,140
Nine.

3301
03:35:04,140 --> 03:35:07,140
Ten.

3302
03:35:07,140 --> 03:35:09,140
Hello, Ninny.

3303
03:35:09,140 --> 03:35:11,140
Don't be frightened.

3304
03:35:11,140 --> 03:35:13,140
Why don't you hide in that bush over there?

3305
03:35:13,140 --> 03:35:16,140
He'll never find you.

3306
03:35:16,140 --> 03:35:18,140
I'm coming.

3307
03:35:18,140 --> 03:35:21,140
Thank you.

3308
03:35:34,140 --> 03:35:36,140
Ouch, my dear.

3309
03:35:36,140 --> 03:35:38,140
God, you sniff.

3310
03:35:58,140 --> 03:36:01,140
Okay.

3311
03:36:04,140 --> 03:36:07,140
Okay.

3312
03:36:27,140 --> 03:36:29,140
Got you, Little Mike.

3313
03:36:29,140 --> 03:36:31,140
No.

3314
03:36:31,140 --> 03:36:34,140
No, we're Ninny's hiding.

3315
03:36:37,140 --> 03:36:39,140
Oh, look.

3316
03:36:39,140 --> 03:36:42,140
Oh.

3317
03:36:45,140 --> 03:36:47,140
Ah, come out, Ninny.

3318
03:36:47,140 --> 03:36:48,140
I've got you.

3319
03:36:48,140 --> 03:36:51,140
That was a good place, but I saw your ribbons.

3320
03:36:51,140 --> 03:36:53,140
Oh.

3321
03:36:53,140 --> 03:36:54,140
Now for snort, Maiden.

3322
03:36:54,140 --> 03:36:58,140
She's always easy to find.

3323
03:36:59,140 --> 03:37:01,140
Ha.

3324
03:37:01,140 --> 03:37:03,140
That's only because she wants to be found.

3325
03:37:03,140 --> 03:37:05,140
Found you, snort, Maiden.

3326
03:37:05,140 --> 03:37:08,140
One.

3327
03:37:10,140 --> 03:37:13,140
Two.

3328
03:37:17,140 --> 03:37:18,140
Three.

3329
03:37:18,140 --> 03:37:19,140
Don't wait, Ninny.

3330
03:37:19,140 --> 03:37:22,140
This is my bush.

3331
03:37:22,140 --> 03:37:25,140
Four.

3332
03:37:29,140 --> 03:37:31,140
Hey, Ninny.

3333
03:37:31,140 --> 03:37:33,140
I'll show you a good place.

3334
03:37:33,140 --> 03:37:36,140
Just come with your uncle stinky.

3335
03:37:46,140 --> 03:37:47,140
Now, don't worry.

3336
03:37:47,140 --> 03:37:48,140
No one will find you there.

3337
03:37:48,140 --> 03:37:50,140
It opens up once you're inside.

3338
03:37:50,140 --> 03:37:51,140
Come on.

3339
03:37:51,140 --> 03:37:52,140
It's a bit steep.

3340
03:37:52,140 --> 03:37:55,140
I'll help you.

3341
03:37:59,140 --> 03:38:01,140
Oh.

3342
03:38:07,140 --> 03:38:08,140
Right.

3343
03:38:08,140 --> 03:38:10,140
That should keep you quiet.

3344
03:38:10,140 --> 03:38:12,140
You're a bit too visible at the moment.

3345
03:38:12,140 --> 03:38:13,140
Oh, let me out.

3346
03:38:13,140 --> 03:38:17,140
But I'm sure if you stay here until tomorrow, no one will see it all.

3347
03:38:17,140 --> 03:38:20,140
Please don't leave me here.

3348
03:38:20,140 --> 03:38:22,140
Please.

3349
03:38:29,140 --> 03:38:31,140
That's it.

3350
03:38:31,140 --> 03:38:34,140
Now tomorrow, we'll hit the bank.

3351
03:38:42,140 --> 03:38:44,140
Let me out.

3352
03:38:44,140 --> 03:38:46,140
Please let me out.

3353
03:38:48,140 --> 03:38:52,140
I'm very glad I thought of bringing Ninny here.

3354
03:38:52,140 --> 03:38:54,140
It's nice to have her here too, Tiki.

3355
03:38:54,140 --> 03:38:56,140
She's no trouble at all.

3356
03:38:56,140 --> 03:39:01,140
She's all pretty eccentric, and it might be just what she needs to make her want to be seen again.

3357
03:39:01,140 --> 03:39:04,140
Oh, and you're very kind, of course.

3358
03:39:04,140 --> 03:39:05,140
Well, thank you.

3359
03:39:05,140 --> 03:39:08,140
I think I suppose we should be flattered, shouldn't we?

3360
03:39:08,140 --> 03:39:10,140
Oh, yes, definitely.

3361
03:39:10,140 --> 03:39:13,140
She started to talk, but her voice is very weak.

3362
03:39:13,140 --> 03:39:15,140
You have to listen very carefully.

3363
03:39:15,140 --> 03:39:18,140
Has it always been like that or just since she was invisible?

3364
03:39:18,140 --> 03:39:19,140
I'm not sure.

3365
03:39:19,140 --> 03:39:21,140
I don't think it was like that before.

3366
03:39:21,140 --> 03:39:26,140
Lots of people manage very well without using their heads, so I'm certain Ninny will be all right.

3367
03:39:26,140 --> 03:39:30,140
Yes, and I'm glad she's got movement in the others to play with.

3368
03:39:30,140 --> 03:39:33,140
She's never had anybody before, you know.

3369
03:39:33,140 --> 03:39:35,140
I think she'd find it a bit difficult to Tiki.

3370
03:39:35,140 --> 03:39:40,140
Well, Mum and Mama, I think that all she needs is something to shock her out of it.

3371
03:39:40,140 --> 03:39:42,140
Huh, got you a little, Mai.

3372
03:39:42,140 --> 03:39:45,140
Oh, that bush was too prickly anyway.

3373
03:39:45,140 --> 03:39:47,140
I expect I'm the last one, hey.

3374
03:39:47,140 --> 03:39:49,140
No, I haven't found Ninny yet.

3375
03:39:49,140 --> 03:39:50,140
Ninny?

3376
03:39:50,140 --> 03:39:52,140
I didn't think Ninny would hide so well.

3377
03:39:52,140 --> 03:39:54,140
Any luck, Sniff?

3378
03:39:54,140 --> 03:39:56,140
There's nowhere else to look, Mum and.

3379
03:39:56,140 --> 03:39:59,140
Perhaps she's lost or fallen or hurt herself.

3380
03:39:59,140 --> 03:40:02,140
Oh, I've looked absolutely everywhere.

3381
03:40:02,140 --> 03:40:04,140
I bet she's invisible again.

3382
03:40:04,140 --> 03:40:06,140
That's why I can't find her.

3383
03:40:06,140 --> 03:40:09,140
I bet Sniff hasn't looked everywhere.

3384
03:40:09,140 --> 03:40:10,140
She can't be far.

3385
03:40:10,140 --> 03:40:12,140
Do you know where she is, Mum and?

3386
03:40:12,140 --> 03:40:14,140
No, I haven't seen her at all.

3387
03:40:14,140 --> 03:40:17,140
Not since we started.

3388
03:40:17,140 --> 03:40:18,140
Ninny!

3389
03:40:18,140 --> 03:40:20,140
Come on, we're going home.

3390
03:40:20,140 --> 03:40:22,140
We've finished playing.

3391
03:40:22,140 --> 03:40:23,140
Ninny!

3392
03:40:23,140 --> 03:40:24,140
Oh, my goodness.

3393
03:40:24,140 --> 03:40:25,140
Where could she be?

3394
03:40:25,140 --> 03:40:26,140
Ninny!

3395
03:40:26,140 --> 03:40:27,140
It's your turn, Sniff.

3396
03:40:27,140 --> 03:40:28,140
See, you've got to find her.

3397
03:40:28,140 --> 03:40:29,140
Ninny!

3398
03:40:29,140 --> 03:40:31,140
Not once the game's over, I haven't.

3399
03:40:31,140 --> 03:40:32,140
Never mind.

3400
03:40:32,140 --> 03:40:33,140
We'll all look.

3401
03:40:33,140 --> 03:40:35,140
We must find her.

3402
03:40:35,140 --> 03:40:38,140
We are supposed to be looking after her, you know?

3403
03:40:38,140 --> 03:40:41,140
Oh, come on.

3404
03:40:41,140 --> 03:40:43,140
Ninny, the game's over.

3405
03:40:43,140 --> 03:40:44,140
We've finished.

3406
03:40:44,140 --> 03:40:45,140
Ninny!

3407
03:40:45,140 --> 03:40:46,140
Ninny!

3408
03:40:46,140 --> 03:40:47,140
Hurry up!

3409
03:40:47,140 --> 03:40:49,140
We're going home for cookies and lemonade!

3410
03:40:49,140 --> 03:40:50,140
Ninny!

3411
03:40:50,140 --> 03:40:51,140
Ninny!

3412
03:40:51,140 --> 03:40:52,140
Ninny!

3413
03:40:52,140 --> 03:40:53,140
Ninny!

3414
03:40:53,140 --> 03:40:54,140
Ninny!

3415
03:40:54,140 --> 03:40:55,140
Ninny!

3416
03:40:55,140 --> 03:40:56,140
Ninny!

3417
03:40:56,140 --> 03:40:57,140
Ninny!

3418
03:40:57,140 --> 03:40:58,140
Ninny!

3419
03:40:58,140 --> 03:40:59,140
Ninny!

3420
03:40:59,140 --> 03:41:00,140
Ninny!

3421
03:41:00,140 --> 03:41:01,140
Ninny!

3422
03:41:01,140 --> 03:41:02,140
Ninny!

3423
03:41:02,140 --> 03:41:03,140
Ninny!

3424
03:41:03,140 --> 03:41:04,140
Ninny!

3425
03:41:04,140 --> 03:41:05,140
Ninny!

3426
03:41:05,140 --> 03:41:06,140
Ninny!

3427
03:41:06,140 --> 03:41:07,140
Ninny!

3428
03:41:07,140 --> 03:41:08,140
Ninny!

3429
03:41:08,140 --> 03:41:09,140
Ninny!

3430
03:41:09,140 --> 03:41:10,140
Ninny!

3431
03:41:10,140 --> 03:41:11,140
Can you hear us?

3432
03:41:11,140 --> 03:41:14,140
We weren't supposed to come this far, Snort Maiden.

3433
03:41:14,140 --> 03:41:18,140
We might be really lost or frightened or anything.

3434
03:41:18,140 --> 03:41:19,140
Ninny!

3435
03:41:19,140 --> 03:41:20,140
Where are you, Ninny?

3436
03:41:20,140 --> 03:41:22,140
Can you hear me?

3437
03:41:22,140 --> 03:41:23,140
Ninny!

3438
03:41:23,140 --> 03:41:24,140
Help!

3439
03:41:24,140 --> 03:41:26,140
I'm over here!

3440
03:41:26,140 --> 03:41:29,140
Did you hear something?

3441
03:41:29,140 --> 03:41:31,140
I'm not sure.

3442
03:41:31,140 --> 03:41:32,140
Help!

3443
03:41:32,140 --> 03:41:33,140
Help!

3444
03:41:33,140 --> 03:41:34,140
I'm here!

3445
03:41:34,140 --> 03:41:35,140
Help!

3446
03:41:35,140 --> 03:41:37,140
That's her!

3447
03:41:37,140 --> 03:41:39,140
She's not far away!

3448
03:41:39,140 --> 03:41:40,140
Ninny!

3449
03:41:40,140 --> 03:41:41,140
Where are you?

3450
03:41:41,140 --> 03:41:42,140
Here!

3451
03:41:42,140 --> 03:41:44,140
Behind this rock!

3452
03:41:44,140 --> 03:41:46,140
Where's her voice coming from?

3453
03:41:46,140 --> 03:41:48,140
That way, I think.

3454
03:41:48,140 --> 03:41:49,140
Ninny!

3455
03:41:49,140 --> 03:41:51,140
I can't hear what you're saying!

3456
03:41:51,140 --> 03:41:53,140
Try and shout a bit louder!

3457
03:41:53,140 --> 03:41:55,140
I'm over here!

3458
03:41:55,140 --> 03:41:56,140
Over here!

3459
03:41:56,140 --> 03:41:58,140
Behind the rock!

3460
03:41:58,140 --> 03:42:00,140
I still can't hear properly!

3461
03:42:00,140 --> 03:42:02,140
Louder than any louder!

3462
03:42:02,140 --> 03:42:04,140
Behind the rock!

3463
03:42:04,140 --> 03:42:06,140
Which rock?

3464
03:42:06,140 --> 03:42:07,140
Over here!

3465
03:42:07,140 --> 03:42:09,140
The big rock!

3466
03:42:10,140 --> 03:42:13,140
Over there!

3467
03:42:13,140 --> 03:42:18,140
I've never shouted so much in my life!

3468
03:42:18,140 --> 03:42:19,140
Ninny!

3469
03:42:19,140 --> 03:42:20,140
Ninny!

3470
03:42:20,140 --> 03:42:22,140
Are you behind this rock, Ninny?

3471
03:42:22,140 --> 03:42:23,140
Yes!

3472
03:42:23,140 --> 03:42:25,140
Stinky block the cave with it!

3473
03:42:25,140 --> 03:42:26,140
Don't worry!

3474
03:42:26,140 --> 03:42:27,140
We'll get you out!

3475
03:42:27,140 --> 03:42:28,140
Hang on!

3476
03:42:36,140 --> 03:42:37,140
Are you alright, Ninny?

3477
03:42:37,140 --> 03:42:39,140
Thank you, Mum!

3478
03:42:39,140 --> 03:42:42,140
Oh, thank you!

3479
03:42:42,140 --> 03:42:44,140
Your voice seems to be...

3480
03:42:44,140 --> 03:42:45,140
Oh, what?

3481
03:42:45,140 --> 03:42:47,140
Oh, nothing!

3482
03:42:47,140 --> 03:42:50,140
Try and hold on to me, and I'll call you out!

3483
03:42:50,140 --> 03:42:52,140
Oh, thank you!

3484
03:42:57,140 --> 03:42:58,140
Hey!

3485
03:42:58,140 --> 03:43:00,140
What's happened?

3486
03:43:00,140 --> 03:43:01,140
Where's your finder?

3487
03:43:01,140 --> 03:43:02,140
In the cave!

3488
03:43:02,140 --> 03:43:03,140
Wow!

3489
03:43:03,140 --> 03:43:05,140
What a brilliant hiding place had you find it!

3490
03:43:05,140 --> 03:43:08,140
What's wrong?

3491
03:43:08,140 --> 03:43:10,140
Did I say something funny?

3492
03:43:13,140 --> 03:43:15,140
Now, that was very mean of Stinky's.

3493
03:43:15,140 --> 03:43:18,140
A clever idea, though, of interuser for a van robbery.

3494
03:43:18,140 --> 03:43:19,140
Oh, Papa!

3495
03:43:19,140 --> 03:43:21,140
Oh, I know Stinky shouldn't have done it,

3496
03:43:21,140 --> 03:43:25,140
and it must have been a nasty shopping trapped in the dark in that cave,

3497
03:43:25,140 --> 03:43:28,140
but no real harm came to her, and she didn't disappear,

3498
03:43:28,140 --> 03:43:30,140
and her voice got much stronger.

3499
03:43:30,140 --> 03:43:32,140
Because she yelled so loud!

3500
03:43:32,140 --> 03:43:35,140
Oh, goodness! Did you, dear?

3501
03:43:35,140 --> 03:43:37,140
Yes, Mum and Mama!

3502
03:43:37,140 --> 03:43:41,140
Mum and told me to yell loudly, so he'd know where I was!

3503
03:43:41,140 --> 03:43:43,140
And it was loud, too!

3504
03:43:43,140 --> 03:43:44,140
Good for you, Ninny.

3505
03:43:44,140 --> 03:43:47,140
It's surprising the things you can do if you have to,

3506
03:43:47,140 --> 03:43:52,140
and you ought to remember that people who speak loudly are usually very noticeable.

3507
03:43:52,140 --> 03:43:55,140
Go on, yo! I want to see it!

3508
03:43:55,140 --> 03:43:57,140
That's a good idea, Ninny.

3509
03:43:57,140 --> 03:43:59,140
If shouting brought back your voice,

3510
03:43:59,140 --> 03:44:01,140
you never know it might be just what's needed to make the rest of you visible.

3511
03:44:01,140 --> 03:44:03,140
Try and get angry, as well.

3512
03:44:03,140 --> 03:44:06,140
Yeah, that's easy. Just think about Stinky.

3513
03:44:06,140 --> 03:44:08,140
Yeah, and how horrible he is!

3514
03:44:08,140 --> 03:44:11,140
That should make you angry. Very angry!

3515
03:44:14,140 --> 03:44:16,140
Just your white Stinky!

3516
03:44:16,140 --> 03:44:18,140
I care how fast it may be!

3517
03:44:21,140 --> 03:44:24,140
Stinky, wait! We want to talk to you!

3518
03:44:24,140 --> 03:44:25,140
I don't want to talk to you!

3519
03:44:25,140 --> 03:44:26,140
No!

3520
03:44:28,140 --> 03:44:30,140
Oh, you are right, Sniff!

3521
03:44:31,140 --> 03:44:34,140
You can't get away, Stinky.

3522
03:44:35,140 --> 03:44:38,140
The forest is my home ground! You won't catch me in here!

3523
03:44:38,140 --> 03:44:39,140
Ah!

3524
03:44:44,140 --> 03:44:46,140
I did it!

3525
03:44:46,140 --> 03:44:48,140
Hold it.

3526
03:44:54,140 --> 03:44:56,140
You can't do this to me!

3527
03:44:56,140 --> 03:44:58,140
We're only doing what you did to Ninny!

3528
03:44:58,140 --> 03:45:02,140
Now look, I needed her to help me! I did, I tell ya!

3529
03:45:02,140 --> 03:45:04,140
But she didn't want to, huh?

3530
03:45:04,140 --> 03:45:08,140
That's why I put her down this hole to change her mind!

3531
03:45:08,140 --> 03:45:12,140
And scare her so much that she'd become totally invisible again!

3532
03:45:12,140 --> 03:45:16,140
She had to be invisible for my plan! Now get me out of here!

3533
03:45:16,140 --> 03:45:18,140
It's all right, Stinky. See you tomorrow!

3534
03:45:18,140 --> 03:45:20,140
No! Good!

3535
03:45:23,140 --> 03:45:25,140
You crushed few things!

3536
03:45:25,140 --> 03:45:28,140
I had such a wonderful plan!

3537
03:45:28,140 --> 03:45:32,140
Ah! Ah! You're spiteful!

3538
03:45:32,140 --> 03:45:35,140
Oh, let's hear them my next job!

3539
03:45:35,140 --> 03:45:40,140
But despite all that had happened, Ninny's face was still not to be seen.

3540
03:45:42,140 --> 03:45:45,140
Then, about ten days later.

3541
03:45:55,140 --> 03:45:58,140
This weather seems to push the nails out.

3542
03:46:00,140 --> 03:46:04,140
I haven't seen anyone stare at the sea like Ninny does.

3543
03:46:04,140 --> 03:46:07,140
Well, maybe she's never seen it before!

3544
03:46:11,140 --> 03:46:14,140
Oh, she's crying now!

3545
03:46:26,140 --> 03:46:30,140
What's the matter?

3546
03:46:30,140 --> 03:46:34,140
It's the sea! It's far too big!

3547
03:46:35,140 --> 03:46:38,140
You don't have to go on it, you know.

3548
03:46:39,140 --> 03:46:42,140
Mama! Mama! What's up?

3549
03:46:46,140 --> 03:46:48,140
What's the matter with her?

3550
03:46:48,140 --> 03:46:53,140
Nothing to worry about. She's never seen the sea before and she's just surprised at how big it is.

3551
03:46:56,140 --> 03:47:00,140
Well, there's an awful lot of water, that's for sure.

3552
03:47:06,140 --> 03:47:10,140
Ninny's lucky. I wish there was something to surprise or excite me.

3553
03:47:10,140 --> 03:47:13,140
Nothing's happened for weeks. Anything would be nice.

3554
03:47:13,140 --> 03:47:15,140
Mama must be bored.

3555
03:47:15,140 --> 03:47:17,140
I think you're right.

3556
03:47:17,140 --> 03:47:19,140
But she never gets bored.

3557
03:47:19,140 --> 03:47:21,140
Well, she is now. She needs something to happen.

3558
03:47:21,140 --> 03:47:24,140
I think we should do something to surprise her.

3559
03:47:24,140 --> 03:47:26,140
Like what?

3560
03:47:26,140 --> 03:47:28,140
Well, I know what we can do.

3561
03:47:28,140 --> 03:47:29,140
Well, tell me.

3562
03:47:29,140 --> 03:47:32,140
We'll creep up behind her and just give her a little push.

3563
03:47:32,140 --> 03:47:35,140
What, Papa? Push her into the sea?

3564
03:47:35,140 --> 03:47:38,140
Oh, Papa, you can't. Mama wouldn't like it.

3565
03:47:38,140 --> 03:47:39,140
Just watch me.

3566
03:47:39,140 --> 03:47:42,140
But the water's freezing. A mama will get all wet.

3567
03:47:42,140 --> 03:47:45,140
We never found the water too cold when we were your age.

3568
03:47:45,140 --> 03:47:47,140
You young people today have no sense of fun.

3569
03:47:47,140 --> 03:47:49,140
Did you really used to do things like that?

3570
03:47:49,140 --> 03:47:51,140
All the time.

3571
03:47:51,140 --> 03:47:52,140
Papa?

3572
03:47:52,140 --> 03:47:53,140
Yes, Mum.

3573
03:47:53,140 --> 03:47:54,140
Oh, nothing.

3574
03:47:54,140 --> 03:47:56,140
Don't worry, Mum.

3575
03:47:56,140 --> 03:47:59,140
Mama enjoys a prank. She'll find it very funny. I promise.

3576
03:48:19,140 --> 03:48:21,140
I know you don't.

3577
03:48:21,140 --> 03:48:26,140
No, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3578
03:48:26,140 --> 03:48:29,140
Don't you dare push her into that big horrible sea?

3579
03:48:29,140 --> 03:48:30,140
Let me explain to me.

3580
03:48:30,140 --> 03:48:33,140
There's nothing to explain. You're a big bully.

3581
03:48:33,140 --> 03:48:35,140
She didn't go all wet.

3582
03:48:35,140 --> 03:48:37,140
What a nasty trick.

3583
03:48:37,140 --> 03:48:39,140
You could never...

3584
03:48:39,140 --> 03:48:41,140
Never.

3585
03:48:41,140 --> 03:48:43,140
Mummy, she didn't go all wet.

3586
03:48:43,140 --> 03:48:45,140
What a nasty trick.

3587
03:48:45,140 --> 03:48:46,140
You could never...

3588
03:48:46,140 --> 03:48:48,140
Never.

3589
03:48:59,140 --> 03:49:00,140
Mimi.

3590
03:49:04,140 --> 03:49:06,140
There's your face, hurry!

3591
03:49:06,140 --> 03:49:07,140
Hurry!

3592
03:49:07,140 --> 03:49:08,140
Hurry!

3593
03:49:08,140 --> 03:49:12,140
That's the last thing to see you.

3594
03:49:12,140 --> 03:49:17,140
What on earth happened? Were you up to something?

3595
03:49:17,140 --> 03:49:23,140
Oh, nothing much. You know, that child has got the sharpest teeth with the without our head.

3596
03:49:23,140 --> 03:49:28,140
A woman, a woman at last. I'm visible again. We're always you won't disappear again.

3597
03:49:28,140 --> 03:49:30,140
Never, I'll never.

3598
03:49:30,140 --> 03:49:34,140
Brave girl, and with a good strong set of healthy teeth, too.

3599
03:49:34,140 --> 03:49:36,140
Oh, I'm so happy, nanny.

3600
03:49:36,140 --> 03:49:38,140
Mimi dear.

3601
03:49:38,140 --> 03:49:42,140
I'm very glad, too.

3602
03:49:46,140 --> 03:49:48,140
Oh.

3603
03:49:48,140 --> 03:49:50,140
Oh.

3604
03:49:50,140 --> 03:49:52,140
Oh.

3605
03:49:52,140 --> 03:49:54,140
Uh.

3606
03:49:54,140 --> 03:49:56,140
Oh.

3607
03:49:56,140 --> 03:49:58,140
Oh.

3608
03:49:58,140 --> 03:50:00,140
Oh.

3609
03:50:00,140 --> 03:50:02,140
Oh.

3610
03:50:02,140 --> 03:50:04,140
Uh.

3611
03:50:04,140 --> 03:50:06,140
Uh.

3612
03:50:06,140 --> 03:50:10,140
Stop laughing, you horrible child. You use sartuth monster.

3613
03:50:10,140 --> 03:50:18,140
What's so funny, huh?

3614
03:50:18,140 --> 03:50:20,140
Oh.

3615
03:50:20,140 --> 03:50:22,140
Oh.

3616
03:50:22,140 --> 03:50:24,140
Oh.

3617
03:50:24,140 --> 03:50:26,140
Oh.

3618
03:50:38,140 --> 03:50:40,140
Really, nanny laughed.

3619
03:50:40,140 --> 03:50:43,140
Well, she certainly changed, momma.

3620
03:50:43,140 --> 03:50:47,140
All she needed was to get angry, and she did.

3621
03:50:47,140 --> 03:50:52,140
I hope movement pop is forgiven, nanny. Thank you all for taking such good care of her.

3622
03:50:52,140 --> 03:50:56,140
I hate to say it, but she sounds almost as bad as it'll mind now.

3623
03:50:56,140 --> 03:50:59,140
Tiki, nanny.

3624
03:51:05,140 --> 03:51:08,140
And so nanny left movement house with Tiki.

3625
03:51:08,140 --> 03:51:14,140
Now that she was completely visible and far from timid, she was ready for anything.

3626
03:51:14,140 --> 03:51:19,140
Anything that is except seeing her aunt, she said.

3627
03:51:19,140 --> 03:51:21,140
Nanny.

3628
03:51:21,140 --> 03:51:24,140
Nanny.

3629
03:51:24,140 --> 03:51:26,140
Nanny.

3630
03:51:26,140 --> 03:51:29,140
Nanny.

3631
03:51:29,140 --> 03:51:31,140
Nanny.

3632
03:51:31,140 --> 03:51:33,140
Nanny.

3633
03:51:33,140 --> 03:51:36,140
Nanny.

3634
03:51:36,140 --> 03:51:38,140
Boom.

3635
03:51:38,140 --> 03:51:40,140
Nanny.

3636
03:51:40,140 --> 03:51:43,140
Nanny.

3637
03:51:53,140 --> 03:52:00,140
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

3638
03:52:00,140 --> 03:52:07,140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

3639
03:52:07,140 --> 03:52:11,140
They're always happy and always at play.

3640
03:52:11,140 --> 03:52:14,140
The movements are having fun day after day.

3641
03:52:14,140 --> 03:52:18,140
The movements.

3642
03:52:18,140 --> 03:52:22,140
The movements.

3643
03:52:22,140 --> 03:52:29,140
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

3644
03:52:29,140 --> 03:52:36,140
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

3645
03:52:36,140 --> 03:52:40,140
They're always happy and always at play.

3646
03:52:40,140 --> 03:52:44,140
The movements are having fun day after day.

3647
03:52:44,140 --> 03:52:47,140
The movements.

3648
03:52:47,140 --> 03:52:51,140
The movements.

3649
03:52:51,140 --> 03:52:57,140
The movements.

3650
03:53:06,140 --> 03:53:16,140
The movements.

3651
03:53:16,140 --> 03:53:19,140
Here they are for one and all.

3652
03:53:19,140 --> 03:53:22,140
The movements are about to come.

3653
03:53:22,140 --> 03:53:25,140
Come on and sit down here with me.

3654
03:53:25,140 --> 03:53:27,140
Therefore you are your TV.

3655
03:53:27,140 --> 03:53:30,140
They are the movements.

3656
03:53:30,140 --> 03:53:33,140
They are the movements.

3657
03:53:33,140 --> 03:53:37,140
So come with me, give me your hand.

3658
03:53:37,140 --> 03:53:40,140
I'll take you up to a movement land.

3659
03:53:40,140 --> 03:53:43,140
You can fly just like a bird.

3660
03:53:43,140 --> 03:53:45,140
Sing that song ever.

3661
03:53:45,140 --> 03:53:48,140
There were the movements.

3662
03:53:48,140 --> 03:53:51,140
There were the movements.

3663
03:53:51,140 --> 03:53:54,140
There were the movements.

3664
03:53:54,140 --> 03:53:57,140
There were the movements.

3665
03:53:57,140 --> 03:54:00,140
There were the movements.

3666
03:54:00,140 --> 03:54:03,140
The movements.

3667
03:54:30,140 --> 03:54:33,140
The movements.

3668
03:54:33,140 --> 03:54:36,140
The movements.

3669
03:54:36,140 --> 03:54:40,140
The movements.

3670
03:54:40,140 --> 03:54:43,140
The movements.

3671
03:54:43,140 --> 03:54:47,140
The movements.

3672
03:54:47,140 --> 03:54:50,140
The movements.

3673
03:54:50,140 --> 03:54:53,140
Snort Maiden is running as if the groke is chasing her.

3674
03:54:53,140 --> 03:54:57,140
I don't think I've ever seen her run so fast.

3675
03:54:57,140 --> 03:54:59,140
Ah.

3676
03:54:59,140 --> 03:55:02,140
Ah.

3677
03:55:02,140 --> 03:55:03,140
Ah.

3678
03:55:03,140 --> 03:55:05,140
I wonder what's the matter?

3679
03:55:05,140 --> 03:55:10,140
Perhaps something terrible has happened.

3680
03:55:14,140 --> 03:55:16,140
Maiden!

3681
03:55:16,140 --> 03:55:17,140
Maiden!

3682
03:55:17,140 --> 03:55:20,140
Maiden Papa!

3683
03:55:20,140 --> 03:55:21,140
Maiden Mama!

3684
03:55:21,140 --> 03:55:24,140
No!

3685
03:55:24,140 --> 03:55:27,840
Come down and tell us what's wrong.

3686
03:55:27,840 --> 03:55:30,940
My brother's on the cliff, and he's about to jump off.

3687
03:55:30,940 --> 03:55:32,040
What snorke?

3688
03:55:32,040 --> 03:55:33,140
Are you sure?

3689
03:55:33,140 --> 03:55:35,340
He says nothing will prevent him doing it.

3690
03:55:35,340 --> 03:55:36,140
Oh, please.

3691
03:55:36,140 --> 03:55:38,240
You must stop him, moment.

3692
03:55:38,240 --> 03:55:40,720
Did you say that you wanted me to help you with something

3693
03:55:40,720 --> 03:55:41,840
snorkemaiden?

3694
03:55:41,840 --> 03:55:42,340
Yes.

3695
03:55:42,340 --> 03:55:45,340
I want you to stop snorke jumping off the south side of the cliff.

3696
03:55:45,340 --> 03:55:46,140
Oh, dear.

3697
03:55:46,140 --> 03:55:47,840
I never thought he was the type.

3698
03:55:47,840 --> 03:55:50,140
He says it's a test flight.

3699
03:55:50,140 --> 03:55:50,940
Oh.

3700
03:55:50,940 --> 03:55:52,340
Now what?

3701
03:55:52,340 --> 03:55:54,140
A test flight, did you say?

3702
03:55:54,140 --> 03:55:57,140
Snorkemaiden, do you mean that he's finally finished building

3703
03:55:57,140 --> 03:55:58,940
his flying ship?

3704
03:55:58,940 --> 03:56:00,540
No, only the blueprint.

3705
03:56:00,540 --> 03:56:01,840
At least I think that's all.

3706
03:56:01,840 --> 03:56:03,140
He doesn't tell me.

3707
03:56:03,140 --> 03:56:05,540
Well, that's a start.

3708
03:56:05,540 --> 03:56:08,040
He built a small model of the flying ship's wings,

3709
03:56:08,040 --> 03:56:11,040
and they don't look strong enough to carry anyone.

3710
03:56:11,040 --> 03:56:12,840
And now he's going to try them out himself

3711
03:56:12,840 --> 03:56:13,940
to see if they'll work.

3712
03:56:13,940 --> 03:56:15,040
And I know they won't.

3713
03:56:15,040 --> 03:56:16,440
They'll break, you know.

3714
03:56:16,440 --> 03:56:18,740
Now, wait a minute, snorkemaiden.

3715
03:56:18,740 --> 03:56:20,340
Slow down and let me think.

3716
03:56:20,340 --> 03:56:23,340
He's made the wings from the blueprint of the flying ship.

3717
03:56:23,340 --> 03:56:25,840
Well, his plans are always very accurate.

3718
03:56:25,840 --> 03:56:27,840
Oh, Papa, you've got to stop him.

3719
03:56:27,840 --> 03:56:30,640
The south side, Papa.

3720
03:56:30,640 --> 03:56:31,940
Yes, I know.

3721
03:56:31,940 --> 03:56:34,140
The highest and steepest one of all.

3722
03:56:34,140 --> 03:56:35,140
Oh, moment, Papa.

3723
03:56:35,140 --> 03:56:37,540
There must be something we can do.

3724
03:56:37,540 --> 03:56:39,140
Yes, I'm sure there is.

3725
03:56:39,140 --> 03:56:39,640
Right.

3726
03:56:39,640 --> 03:56:40,440
Hurry, everybody.

3727
03:56:40,440 --> 03:56:41,740
There's no time to lose.

3728
03:56:41,740 --> 03:56:42,740
Come on.

3729
03:56:42,740 --> 03:56:44,740
Oh, thank you, moment, Papa.

3730
03:56:50,340 --> 03:57:04,340
Come on.

3731
03:57:04,340 --> 03:57:17,740
All right.

3732
03:57:17,740 --> 03:57:20,740
Oh, my God!

3733
03:57:20,740 --> 03:57:23,740
Oh, my God!

3734
03:57:27,740 --> 03:57:29,740
A snork? Wait!

3735
03:57:29,740 --> 03:57:31,740
Wait, please!

3736
03:57:31,740 --> 03:57:34,740
Stop, snork! Don't do it!

3737
03:57:35,740 --> 03:57:38,740
Why have you brought everybody here, snork maiden?

3738
03:57:38,740 --> 03:57:40,740
They've come to beg you not to do it!

3739
03:57:40,740 --> 03:57:42,740
You're too young and brilliant for such a tragic end!

3740
03:57:42,740 --> 03:57:44,740
Thank the bobble we were in time!

3741
03:57:44,740 --> 03:57:47,740
As a matter of fact, you weren't.

3742
03:57:47,740 --> 03:57:48,740
Oh, really?

3743
03:57:48,740 --> 03:57:51,740
It looks very dangerous to me, snork.

3744
03:57:51,740 --> 03:57:53,740
Well, it's not a tall woman, Papa.

3745
03:57:53,740 --> 03:57:56,740
I made these wings myself. They're perfectly balanced.

3746
03:57:56,740 --> 03:57:59,740
Well, yes, I'm sure they are.

3747
03:57:59,740 --> 03:58:03,740
The blueprints are detailed and precise. They're quite safe.

3748
03:58:03,740 --> 03:58:08,740
Tell me, snork. Why did you stop on the edge like that after running down the slope?

3749
03:58:08,740 --> 03:58:11,740
I was measuring the right length for my approach run.

3750
03:58:12,740 --> 03:58:15,740
Don't do it, snork. I don't want to lose my only brother.

3751
03:58:15,740 --> 03:58:17,740
Don't make such a fuss, snork maiden.

3752
03:58:17,740 --> 03:58:19,740
Do you really think it's safe?

3753
03:58:19,740 --> 03:58:23,740
Of course it is. You don't see birds falling out of the sky, do you?

3754
03:58:23,740 --> 03:58:29,740
Well, at least, do your test flight just above the ground so that if something happens to go wrong, you won't hurt yourself.

3755
03:58:29,740 --> 03:58:34,740
I've already done that from the roof of our house, and it worked beautifully.

3756
03:58:34,740 --> 03:58:35,740
Did you see him?

3757
03:58:35,740 --> 03:58:37,740
No, I didn't see anything.

3758
03:58:37,740 --> 03:58:40,740
Of course you didn't. Do you think I let a wimpy little sister watch me?

3759
03:58:41,740 --> 03:58:43,740
What's that supposed to mean, snork?

3760
03:58:43,740 --> 03:58:47,740
Just that I don't want you sticking your big nose into my affairs all the time.

3761
03:58:47,740 --> 03:58:49,740
I don't like it, and there's nothing to do with you.

3762
03:58:49,740 --> 03:58:52,740
Yours is just as big, and I don't want to lose you.

3763
03:58:52,740 --> 03:58:54,740
Don't go on about losing me.

3764
03:58:54,740 --> 03:58:55,740
Why not?

3765
03:58:55,740 --> 03:58:57,740
Come on now, you two. Stop it.

3766
03:58:57,740 --> 03:58:58,740
Hey!

3767
03:58:58,740 --> 03:59:00,740
Oops! That was close.

3768
03:59:00,740 --> 03:59:03,740
Snork maiden, I don't think your brother is going to be stopped.

3769
03:59:03,740 --> 03:59:05,740
Oh dear, oh dear.

3770
03:59:05,740 --> 03:59:07,740
You're very brave, snork.

3771
03:59:10,740 --> 03:59:13,740
Right, here we go.

3772
03:59:13,740 --> 03:59:17,740
This time it'll be a perfect takeoff.

3773
03:59:17,740 --> 03:59:19,740
It's a long way.

3774
03:59:19,740 --> 03:59:21,740
Oh look, isn't that snuffkin down there?

3775
03:59:21,740 --> 03:59:24,740
Where? Where is he? Where's snuffkin?

3776
03:59:24,740 --> 03:59:27,740
You can't see him from there, Sniff. You'll have to come here.

3777
03:59:27,740 --> 03:59:29,740
Is it really snuffkin?

3778
03:59:29,740 --> 03:59:33,740
Yes, I'm sure it is. Snuffkin!

3779
03:59:33,740 --> 03:59:35,740
Yeah!

3780
03:59:35,740 --> 03:59:37,740
Baby, hear you?

3781
03:59:37,740 --> 03:59:39,740
No, I don't think so.

3782
03:59:39,740 --> 03:59:41,740
All right, here goes!

3783
03:59:41,740 --> 03:59:43,740
Good luck, Snork!

3784
04:00:00,740 --> 04:00:02,740
He's flying!

3785
04:00:09,740 --> 04:00:11,740
Oh!

3786
04:00:22,740 --> 04:00:24,740
It's the snork!

3787
04:00:40,740 --> 04:00:42,740
Hey!

3788
04:00:45,740 --> 04:00:47,740
Look at him flying!

3789
04:00:47,740 --> 04:00:49,740
It's all right, Snork maiden.

3790
04:00:49,740 --> 04:00:52,740
Your brother's doing fine. Come and see.

3791
04:00:54,740 --> 04:00:57,740
He's done it! He's done it!

3792
04:00:57,740 --> 04:01:00,740
Whoa, I knew he could do it.

3793
04:01:00,740 --> 04:01:02,740
Well, so did I, to be honest.

3794
04:01:02,740 --> 04:01:03,740
Huh?

3795
04:01:03,740 --> 04:01:05,740
You, Snork!

3796
04:01:09,740 --> 04:01:12,740
Hello!

3797
04:01:12,740 --> 04:01:15,740
Hey! Hey!

3798
04:01:15,740 --> 04:01:16,740
Hey!

3799
04:01:16,740 --> 04:01:20,740
I remember this test flight is a great success!

3800
04:01:40,740 --> 04:01:44,740
Just as I thought he can't fly and wave at the same time.

3801
04:01:44,740 --> 04:01:47,740
Interesting!

3802
04:01:47,740 --> 04:01:49,740
That was mean, stinky.

3803
04:01:49,740 --> 04:01:52,740
If I could get him to wave with both arms, he'd probably fall.

3804
04:01:52,740 --> 04:01:57,740
Look, we don't want you here, stinky. Why don't you just go away?

3805
04:01:57,740 --> 04:02:00,740
I can find lots to do with that machine.

3806
04:02:00,740 --> 04:02:03,740
If you won't go away, I will.

3807
04:02:03,740 --> 04:02:08,740
Well, go on, Snuffkin. What do I care what you do?

3808
04:02:08,740 --> 04:02:12,740
Hmm, that would be perfect for robberies.

3809
04:02:12,740 --> 04:02:15,740
The wind seems to be taking him out to sea.

3810
04:02:15,740 --> 04:02:18,740
Why doesn't he turn around and come back?

3811
04:02:18,740 --> 04:02:21,740
Turning in that thing might not be so easy.

3812
04:02:21,740 --> 04:02:23,740
What? Do you mean he can't?

3813
04:02:23,740 --> 04:02:26,740
Well, don't worry, Snork maiden. Of course he can.

3814
04:02:26,740 --> 04:02:31,740
Oh, what's this I can't turn on?

3815
04:02:32,740 --> 04:02:33,740
Oh!

3816
04:02:41,740 --> 04:02:43,740
Oh, he's hit a tree.

3817
04:02:43,740 --> 04:02:45,740
Come on, hurry!

3818
04:03:02,740 --> 04:03:04,740
No!

3819
04:03:07,740 --> 04:03:09,740
Is he dead?

3820
04:03:09,740 --> 04:03:11,740
No, he's been knocked out.

3821
04:03:11,740 --> 04:03:13,740
He looks dead to me anyway.

3822
04:03:13,740 --> 04:03:15,740
Where are they? What's happened to the wings?

3823
04:03:15,740 --> 04:03:17,740
In the tree.

3824
04:03:17,740 --> 04:03:20,740
Ah, he won't want them anymore, so now I can have them.

3825
04:03:20,740 --> 04:03:23,740
Now, let me see.

3826
04:03:32,740 --> 04:03:34,740
So, did the test fly go all right?

3827
04:03:34,740 --> 04:03:37,740
Will someone tell me what happened?

3828
04:03:37,740 --> 04:03:41,740
Well, it was fine until the very end.

3829
04:03:41,740 --> 04:03:44,740
I'm sure that you only need a bit more practice.

3830
04:03:44,740 --> 04:03:47,740
Flying isn't the easiest thing to master, you know.

3831
04:03:47,740 --> 04:03:51,740
I expect so. Let's hope you don't run out of bandages, though.

3832
04:03:51,740 --> 04:03:53,740
Excuse me.

3833
04:03:53,740 --> 04:03:55,740
Snork?

3834
04:03:55,740 --> 04:03:57,740
Are you going to use the wings anymore?

3835
04:03:57,740 --> 04:03:59,740
I might not. Why?

3836
04:03:59,740 --> 04:04:02,740
Oh, well, I'll have them if you don't want them.

3837
04:04:02,740 --> 04:04:04,740
I want to fly in the sky, too.

3838
04:04:04,740 --> 04:04:06,740
It looks the most exciting thing I've ever seen.

3839
04:04:06,740 --> 04:04:08,740
Oh, please let me have them.

3840
04:04:08,740 --> 04:04:11,740
Well, it's not as simple as that, movement.

3841
04:04:11,740 --> 04:04:14,740
They need testing before the design changes.

3842
04:04:14,740 --> 04:04:17,740
I'm not going to use the wings anymore.

3843
04:04:17,740 --> 04:04:20,740
Well, I'll have them if you don't want them.

3844
04:04:21,740 --> 04:04:24,740
They need testing before the design is complete.

3845
04:04:24,740 --> 04:04:27,740
But I could do that, Snork. I know I could do it.

3846
04:04:27,740 --> 04:04:29,740
Please let me have them.

3847
04:04:29,740 --> 04:04:31,740
Well, I suppose I could do with some help.

3848
04:04:31,740 --> 04:04:34,740
There's a lot to do, fetching and carrying mostly.

3849
04:04:34,740 --> 04:04:37,740
You haven't said if I can have the wings or not yet, Snork.

3850
04:04:37,740 --> 04:04:39,740
Yes, you can, but on one condition.

3851
04:04:39,740 --> 04:04:41,740
Anything.

3852
04:04:41,740 --> 04:04:45,740
Well, now the blueprints are finished and the wings are more or less right.

3853
04:04:45,740 --> 04:04:49,740
I'll need somewhere to build the ship and somewhere to store all the materials

3854
04:04:49,740 --> 04:04:51,740
so they'll be dry and at hand.

3855
04:04:51,740 --> 04:04:54,740
Yes, you will, Snork. I can see that.

3856
04:04:54,740 --> 04:04:58,740
It doesn't have to be much, just a roof will do, or and walls.

3857
04:04:58,740 --> 04:05:01,740
So that people can't spy on me and steal my ideas.

3858
04:05:01,740 --> 04:05:04,740
I can do the building myself, but I'll need some help

3859
04:05:04,740 --> 04:05:06,740
and when it's finished, you can have the wings.

3860
04:05:06,740 --> 04:05:08,740
Great. I'd love to help you.

3861
04:05:08,740 --> 04:05:11,740
I'd have done that anyway, but now that I can have the wings,

3862
04:05:11,740 --> 04:05:14,740
I'll work twice as hard. You won't regret it, Snork.

3863
04:05:14,740 --> 04:05:16,740
I promise you you won't.

3864
04:05:16,740 --> 04:05:19,740
Splendid, woman. That settled them.

3865
04:05:19,740 --> 04:05:21,740
Perhaps we can get more help.

3866
04:05:21,740 --> 04:05:24,740
I'm sure that'd be easy. How about it, Snork?

3867
04:05:24,740 --> 04:05:26,740
Yes, of course.

3868
04:05:26,740 --> 04:05:28,740
Will you help us do Sniff?

3869
04:05:28,740 --> 04:05:30,740
Yes, but I want something too.

3870
04:05:30,740 --> 04:05:33,740
I'll let you borrow the wings.

3871
04:05:33,740 --> 04:05:37,740
No, I'm far too heavy. I only break them.

3872
04:05:37,740 --> 04:05:41,740
Don't worry, Sniff. I'm sure I'll think of something you can have.

3873
04:05:41,740 --> 04:05:44,740
Oh, as long as it's something nice.

3874
04:05:44,740 --> 04:05:46,740
How I do love helping people.

3875
04:05:46,740 --> 04:05:50,740
You're all hard, Sniff. We know that for sure.

3876
04:05:53,740 --> 04:05:57,740
I'm sure you'll need some expert help with the shed, Snork.

3877
04:06:08,740 --> 04:06:10,740
Surely this must be deep enough, Papa?

3878
04:06:10,740 --> 04:06:14,740
Oh, no. We moments are always built for posterity.

3879
04:06:14,740 --> 04:06:17,740
Besides, I like pouring cement.

3880
04:06:17,740 --> 04:06:19,740
Okay, Papa.

3881
04:06:34,740 --> 04:06:37,740
I've given your present a lot of fortune, all.

3882
04:06:37,740 --> 04:06:38,740
Huh?

3883
04:06:38,740 --> 04:06:42,740
And I think I'll give you one of my invaluable books on machinery.

3884
04:06:42,740 --> 04:06:45,740
Oh, don't you want it?

3885
04:06:45,740 --> 04:06:49,740
Well, if there was something else, I'm not much of a reader.

3886
04:06:49,740 --> 04:06:53,740
What about my invaluable fountain pen?

3887
04:06:53,740 --> 04:06:55,740
Invaluable fountain pen?

3888
04:06:55,740 --> 04:06:57,740
What about my invaluable...

3889
04:06:57,740 --> 04:07:00,740
Do you have anything that's not invaluable, Snork?

3890
04:07:00,740 --> 04:07:03,740
Well, what about a gold coin?

3891
04:07:03,740 --> 04:07:06,740
Well, that sounds great. A real gold coin?

3892
04:07:06,740 --> 04:07:09,740
Oh, boy, yes, that's a deal.

3893
04:07:29,740 --> 04:07:32,740
You are digging a very deep hole.

3894
04:07:32,740 --> 04:07:35,740
Oh, why don't you stop and have some sandwiches?

3895
04:07:35,740 --> 04:07:38,740
Should we do that, Papa? Go on.

3896
04:07:38,740 --> 04:07:40,740
Yes, I think we can stop now.

3897
04:07:40,740 --> 04:07:42,740
Sniff and your brother are in the woods.

3898
04:07:42,740 --> 04:07:44,740
Yes, I know. I heard them.

3899
04:07:51,740 --> 04:07:53,740
Hi, Snork, maybe.

3900
04:07:55,740 --> 04:07:57,740
Oh, no.

3901
04:07:57,740 --> 04:08:00,740
Wait a minute. I want to ask you something.

3902
04:08:00,740 --> 04:08:01,740
What is it?

3903
04:08:01,740 --> 04:08:05,740
Tell me, Snork, is it true that your brother gave those wings to a woman?

3904
04:08:05,740 --> 04:08:10,740
Yes, it is. He's helping Snork to build the shed his payment.

3905
04:08:10,740 --> 04:08:14,740
I thought they'd been broken up. They hit that tree very hard.

3906
04:08:14,740 --> 04:08:16,740
Well, my brother's repairing them.

3907
04:08:16,740 --> 04:08:19,740
Will you let me pass? I've got to take his lunch to him.

3908
04:08:19,740 --> 04:08:22,740
And will he be able to repair them?

3909
04:08:22,740 --> 04:08:25,740
He can repair anything.

3910
04:08:26,740 --> 04:08:27,740
Mmm.

3911
04:08:27,740 --> 04:08:30,740
Gosh, what a lot of wood you've got.

3912
04:08:30,740 --> 04:08:34,740
Well, the shed has to be a lot bigger than my flying ship.

3913
04:08:34,740 --> 04:08:37,740
Moomin and Moomin Papa are digging holes. They sure are deep.

3914
04:08:37,740 --> 04:08:42,740
Everybody's being very kind, very kind indeed.

3915
04:08:44,740 --> 04:08:48,740
Mama's cooking and Snuffkin's gone to get nails.

3916
04:08:48,740 --> 04:08:51,740
There are some other things I need him to get as well.

3917
04:08:51,740 --> 04:08:53,740
Will you write them down?

3918
04:08:54,740 --> 04:08:57,740
Of course I will, Snork. Oh, you're such a planner.

3919
04:08:57,740 --> 04:09:01,740
Well, I'm afraid all famous inventors have to be.

3920
04:09:11,740 --> 04:09:13,740
Whether it was Snork's planning,

3921
04:09:13,740 --> 04:09:17,740
or the fact that everyone in Moomin Valley helped in some way or other,

3922
04:09:17,740 --> 04:09:21,740
the hanger or boat house was finished in a record time.

3923
04:09:23,740 --> 04:09:25,740
I'm going to take a look.

3924
04:09:25,740 --> 04:09:27,740
I'm going to take a look.

3925
04:09:27,740 --> 04:09:29,740
I'm going to take a look.

3926
04:09:29,740 --> 04:09:31,740
I'm going to take a look.

3927
04:09:31,740 --> 04:09:33,740
I'm going to take a look.

3928
04:09:33,740 --> 04:09:35,740
I'm going to take a look.

3929
04:09:35,740 --> 04:09:37,740
I'm going to take a look.

3930
04:09:37,740 --> 04:09:39,740
I'm going to take a look.

3931
04:09:39,740 --> 04:09:41,740
I'm going to take a look.

3932
04:09:41,740 --> 04:09:43,740
I'm going to take a look.

3933
04:09:43,740 --> 04:09:45,740
I'm going to take a look.

3934
04:09:45,740 --> 04:09:47,740
I'm going to take a look.

3935
04:09:47,740 --> 04:09:49,740
I'm going to take a look.

3936
04:09:49,740 --> 04:09:51,740
I'm going to take a look.

3937
04:09:51,740 --> 04:09:53,740
I'm going to take a look.

3938
04:09:53,740 --> 04:09:55,740
I'm going to take a look.

3939
04:09:55,740 --> 04:09:57,740
I'm going to take a look.

3940
04:09:57,740 --> 04:09:59,740
I'm going to take a look.

3941
04:09:59,740 --> 04:10:01,740
I'm going to take a look.

3942
04:10:01,740 --> 04:10:03,740
I'm going to take a look.

3943
04:10:03,740 --> 04:10:05,740
I'm going to take a look.

3944
04:10:05,740 --> 04:10:07,740
You?

3945
04:10:07,740 --> 04:10:09,740
Moomin's here.

3946
04:10:09,740 --> 04:10:11,740
Come in, Moomin.

3947
04:10:11,740 --> 04:10:13,740
Thank you for all your help.

3948
04:10:13,740 --> 04:10:17,740
You did so much that these wings are hardly paymented enough.

3949
04:10:17,740 --> 04:10:19,740
But if you're happy with them.

3950
04:10:19,740 --> 04:10:21,740
You make fun building the shed.

3951
04:10:21,740 --> 04:10:25,740
I change the design a bit, so it's easier to take off on land.

3952
04:10:25,740 --> 04:10:29,740
And turning shouldn't be a problem anymore.

3953
04:10:29,740 --> 04:10:31,740
You must remember to give yourself plenty of time, Moomin.

3954
04:10:31,740 --> 04:10:33,740
Thank you, Snork.

3955
04:10:33,740 --> 04:10:35,740
I can't wait to try them out.

3956
04:10:35,740 --> 04:10:37,740
I'm so excited I don't think I'll sleep tonight.

3957
04:10:37,740 --> 04:10:39,740
Are you trying them out tomorrow?

3958
04:10:39,740 --> 04:10:41,740
As soon as I can.

3959
04:10:41,740 --> 04:10:43,740
You will be careful.

3960
04:10:43,740 --> 04:10:45,740
You must practice a lot just above the ground to get used to

3961
04:10:45,740 --> 04:10:47,740
wearing them before you try to go too high.

3962
04:10:47,740 --> 04:10:50,360
I don't want anything to happen to you.

3963
04:10:50,360 --> 04:10:52,200
Oh, practice, I promise.

3964
04:10:58,200 --> 04:11:00,120
Where are you going to practice tomorrow?

3965
04:11:00,120 --> 04:11:01,520
I haven't decided.

3966
04:11:04,840 --> 04:11:07,320
I'll find somewhere when I come out tomorrow,

3967
04:11:07,320 --> 04:11:09,880
perhaps on that small hill near the cliff.

3968
04:11:09,880 --> 04:11:11,720
Well, that can't be too dangerous.

3969
04:11:11,720 --> 04:11:12,720
I'll see you there.

3970
04:11:47,740 --> 04:11:57,740
Hi, Momen. Where do you put the wings?

3971
04:11:57,740 --> 04:12:09,740
On the table outside, you must have gone past them

3972
04:12:09,740 --> 04:12:11,740
if you came in through the veranda door.

3973
04:12:11,740 --> 04:12:15,740
No, I didn't. They're not there.

3974
04:12:15,740 --> 04:12:17,740
What?

3975
04:12:21,740 --> 04:12:25,740
Oh, no, you're right. They're gone.

3976
04:12:25,740 --> 04:12:27,740
Oh dear, I thought it was mine.

3977
04:12:27,740 --> 04:12:29,740
What's happened to them?

3978
04:12:29,740 --> 04:12:30,740
Somebody stolen them.

3979
04:12:30,740 --> 04:12:32,740
What's the matter with you, too?

3980
04:12:32,740 --> 04:12:33,740
Is something wrong?

3981
04:12:33,740 --> 04:12:36,740
Yes, somebody stolen Momen's wings.

3982
04:12:36,740 --> 04:12:39,740
Well, perhaps they haven't been stolen.

3983
04:12:39,740 --> 04:12:43,740
Of course they have, and I bet I know who did it, too.

3984
04:12:43,740 --> 04:12:44,740
Come on.

3985
04:12:44,740 --> 04:12:47,740
Where are we going? Do you know where they are?

3986
04:12:55,740 --> 04:12:56,740
It's stinky.

3987
04:12:56,740 --> 04:13:00,740
Oh, yeah. Well, it certainly didn't take you long.

3988
04:13:00,740 --> 04:13:03,740
Just a minute, stinky. Those are my wings.

3989
04:13:03,740 --> 04:13:05,740
See? I knew it was him.

3990
04:13:09,740 --> 04:13:11,740
Stop, you horrible creature.

3991
04:13:11,740 --> 04:13:13,740
I certainly will back.

3992
04:13:13,740 --> 04:13:16,740
If you give them back, stinky, I'll let you try them out later.

3993
04:13:16,740 --> 04:13:17,740
I promise.

3994
04:13:17,740 --> 04:13:22,740
No way, boom. When they're mine now, I'm going to be a high flier.

3995
04:13:22,740 --> 04:13:24,740
Look out, moving.

3996
04:13:27,740 --> 04:13:28,740
Oh, stop!

3997
04:13:28,740 --> 04:13:30,740
Oh, no.

3998
04:13:30,740 --> 04:13:33,740
You're pathetic.

3999
04:13:33,740 --> 04:13:35,740
The wings are mine.

4000
04:13:35,740 --> 04:13:38,740
I'll become a master criminal now.

4001
04:13:39,740 --> 04:13:42,740
All rotten seabing.

4002
04:13:42,740 --> 04:13:45,740
You shouldn't have left them outside, Momen.

4003
04:13:45,740 --> 04:13:48,740
Yeah, but who'd think let each steal them?

4004
04:13:48,740 --> 04:13:49,740
Where his friends?

4005
04:13:49,740 --> 04:13:50,740
Well, almost.

4006
04:13:50,740 --> 04:13:53,740
I didn't think even stinky would do something like that.

4007
04:13:53,740 --> 04:13:54,740
Well, he did, didn't he?

4008
04:13:54,740 --> 04:13:56,740
Now, don't worry, Momen.

4009
04:13:56,740 --> 04:13:59,740
We'll find him and get them back. I know it.

4010
04:14:05,740 --> 04:14:07,740
Look, Momen, now he's going towards the sea.

4011
04:14:09,740 --> 04:14:13,740
Oh, no, turn around.

4012
04:14:13,740 --> 04:14:15,740
But stinky didn't know how to maneuver the wings.

4013
04:14:15,740 --> 04:14:18,740
It must take him further and further out.

4014
04:14:21,740 --> 04:14:24,740
Turn around, we'll get turned back.

4015
04:14:24,740 --> 04:14:25,740
Until?

4016
04:14:33,740 --> 04:14:35,740
You're at least he's having a bath for once.

4017
04:14:35,740 --> 04:14:37,740
The wings will be badly damaged.

4018
04:14:38,740 --> 04:14:39,740
Never mind.

4019
04:14:39,740 --> 04:14:41,740
Snark will build another pair.

4020
04:14:41,740 --> 04:14:43,740
I sure hope so.

4021
04:15:08,740 --> 04:15:14,740
They love the laughter and they love the living.

4022
04:15:14,740 --> 04:15:17,740
The movements.

4023
04:15:17,740 --> 04:15:25,740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

4024
04:15:25,740 --> 04:15:28,740
They're always happy and always at play.

4025
04:15:28,740 --> 04:15:32,740
The movements are having fun day after day.

4026
04:15:32,740 --> 04:15:35,740
The movements.

4027
04:15:36,740 --> 04:15:40,740
The movements.

4028
04:15:40,740 --> 04:15:43,740
They love the laughter and they love the living.

4029
04:15:43,740 --> 04:15:47,740
The movements.

4030
04:15:47,740 --> 04:15:54,740
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

4031
04:15:54,740 --> 04:15:58,740
They're always happy and always at play.

4032
04:15:58,740 --> 04:16:02,740
The movements are having fun day after day.

4033
04:16:02,740 --> 04:16:05,740
The movements.

4034
04:16:05,740 --> 04:16:09,740
The movements.

4035
04:16:09,740 --> 04:16:15,740
The movements.

4036
04:16:33,740 --> 04:16:37,740
Here they are for one and all.

4037
04:16:37,740 --> 04:16:40,740
The movements are about to come.

4038
04:16:40,740 --> 04:16:43,740
Come on and sit down here with me.

4039
04:16:43,740 --> 04:16:45,740
Therefore you are your TV.

4040
04:16:45,740 --> 04:16:48,740
They are the movements.

4041
04:16:48,740 --> 04:16:51,740
They are the movements.

4042
04:16:51,740 --> 04:16:54,740
So come with me, give me your hand.

4043
04:16:54,740 --> 04:16:57,740
I'll take you up to a movement land.

4044
04:16:57,740 --> 04:17:00,740
You can fly just like a bird.

4045
04:17:00,740 --> 04:17:03,740
Sing the best song ever.

4046
04:17:03,740 --> 04:17:06,740
There were the movements.

4047
04:17:06,740 --> 04:17:09,740
There were the movements.

4048
04:17:09,740 --> 04:17:12,740
There were the movements.

4049
04:17:12,740 --> 04:17:15,740
There were the movements.

4050
04:17:15,740 --> 04:17:18,740
There were the movements.

4051
04:17:18,740 --> 04:17:21,740
There were the movements.

4052
04:17:30,740 --> 04:17:33,740
There were the movements.

4053
04:17:33,740 --> 04:17:36,740
There were the movements.

4054
04:17:36,740 --> 04:17:39,740
There were the movements.

4055
04:17:39,740 --> 04:17:42,740
There were the movements.

4056
04:17:42,740 --> 04:17:45,740
There were the movements.

4057
04:17:45,740 --> 04:17:48,740
There were the movements.

4058
04:17:48,740 --> 04:17:51,740
There were the movements.

4059
04:17:51,740 --> 04:17:54,740
There were the movements.

4060
04:17:54,740 --> 04:17:57,740
There were the movements.

4061
04:17:57,740 --> 04:18:01,740
There were the movements.

4062
04:18:01,740 --> 04:18:06,740
Captain Blood and his band of feared pirates had sailed the seas for many years,

4063
04:18:06,740 --> 04:18:09,740
but never could he remember a storm such as this.

4064
04:18:09,740 --> 04:18:15,740
He began to wonder whether his ship could withstand the battering and buffeting of the angry waves for much longer.

4065
04:18:15,740 --> 04:18:21,740
Alas, he is now too late to launch the lifeboat, he thought, as he lashed himself to the wheel.

4066
04:18:21,740 --> 04:18:24,740
His voice rose against the wind.

4067
04:18:24,740 --> 04:18:30,740
The blood can think of no better death than to journey to the bottom of the sea, losing the last battle against his old adversary.

4068
04:18:30,740 --> 04:18:34,740
But if only I could see the life of the young and beautiful princess,

4069
04:18:34,740 --> 04:18:37,740
who I rescued from the Duke scallion before a ciker.

4070
04:18:37,740 --> 04:18:41,740
I care not about the three chests of doubloons, two chests of jewels,

4071
04:18:41,740 --> 04:18:45,740
and 36 bales of the richest and most colorful silks.

4072
04:18:45,740 --> 04:18:49,740
But oh, must she too perish in this terrible storm.

4073
04:18:49,740 --> 04:18:51,740
Did a good book, Moomin?

4074
04:18:51,740 --> 04:18:54,740
Mmm, it's great.

4075
04:18:54,740 --> 04:18:57,740
What a terrible storm, it's not easing at all.

4076
04:18:57,740 --> 04:18:58,740
No.

4077
04:18:58,740 --> 04:19:01,740
I'm so glad I'm not on my own in a night like this.

4078
04:19:01,740 --> 04:19:04,740
I feel safe in Moomin house.

4079
04:19:04,740 --> 04:19:06,740
Oh, what was that?

4080
04:19:06,740 --> 04:19:09,740
It sounded like a tree breaking.

4081
04:19:09,740 --> 04:19:10,740
Hey, Moomin.

4082
04:19:10,740 --> 04:19:13,740
Mmm, why don't you read your story out loud?

4083
04:19:13,740 --> 04:19:14,740
Oh, okay.

4084
04:19:14,740 --> 04:19:16,740
But can I start where I got to?

4085
04:19:16,740 --> 04:19:19,740
As long as you tell us what's happened before, we won't know what it's about.

4086
04:19:19,740 --> 04:19:21,740
And we might have missed something important.

4087
04:19:21,740 --> 04:19:23,740
Just the main points will do, Moomin.

4088
04:19:23,740 --> 04:19:25,740
Well, there's this brave part.

4089
04:19:25,740 --> 04:19:27,740
Oh, it's so much fun when someone reads out loud.

4090
04:19:27,740 --> 04:19:29,740
Go on, Moomin.

4091
04:19:29,740 --> 04:19:30,740
Captain Blood.

4092
04:19:30,740 --> 04:19:34,740
And he and his men have captured a rich and royal galleon.

4093
04:19:34,740 --> 04:19:38,740
They've taken lots of gold, silver, and jewels and things.

4094
04:19:38,740 --> 04:19:40,740
And oh, yes, a princess, too.

4095
04:19:40,740 --> 04:19:42,740
It's exciting, isn't it?

4096
04:19:42,740 --> 04:19:44,740
Yes, it is.

4097
04:19:45,740 --> 04:19:51,740
The storm that rose that night was so violent that at first,

4098
04:19:51,740 --> 04:19:56,740
it seemed inevitable the ship found before the waves had engulfed it.

4099
04:19:56,740 --> 04:19:59,740
Not bad, if I say so myself.

4100
04:19:59,740 --> 04:20:03,740
Captain Blood saw that the poor princess had indeed swooned.

4101
04:20:03,740 --> 04:20:09,740
With only the rats for company, how frightened she must have been down in the old.

4102
04:20:09,740 --> 04:20:13,740
The noise of the storm was deafening as the ship was thrown above.

4103
04:20:14,740 --> 04:20:16,740
Under swirling sea.

4104
04:20:16,740 --> 04:20:19,740
The captain's brave heart went out to his young and beautiful captain.

4105
04:20:19,740 --> 04:20:21,740
Would I have some tea, Mama?

4106
04:20:21,740 --> 04:20:23,740
Of course, dear. Would you like me to bring it up to you?

4107
04:20:23,740 --> 04:20:25,740
No, thanks. I've finished for the day.

4108
04:20:25,740 --> 04:20:28,740
That's good. Shall we all have some tea and lemonade?

4109
04:20:28,740 --> 04:20:31,740
Yes, please. I'm very thirsty.

4110
04:20:31,740 --> 04:20:33,740
You read very well. Thank you, Moomin.

4111
04:20:33,740 --> 04:20:35,740
Great story, isn't it?

4112
04:20:35,740 --> 04:20:37,740
Could I have some strawberry juice, please, Mama?

4113
04:20:37,740 --> 04:20:40,740
It's not made, and when is your brother coming home?

4114
04:20:40,740 --> 04:20:44,740
He didn't say exactly, but in a couple of days, I should think.

4115
04:20:44,740 --> 04:20:49,740
It was a good idea to let snort-making stay while he was away, wasn't it, Papa?

4116
04:20:49,740 --> 04:20:55,740
Yes, it wouldn't be very nice to be all on your own at night in a storm like this.

4117
04:20:55,740 --> 04:20:57,740
Not at all.

4118
04:21:11,740 --> 04:21:13,740
She seems to be sinking.

4119
04:21:13,740 --> 04:21:15,740
She won't be able to hold out much longer.

4120
04:21:15,740 --> 04:21:18,740
We must get to the crew without delay.

4121
04:21:18,740 --> 04:21:20,740
How could we launch a boat in this weather?

4122
04:21:20,740 --> 04:21:22,740
Any survivors?

4123
04:21:22,740 --> 04:21:25,740
We haven't found anyone yet.

4124
04:21:25,740 --> 04:21:28,740
So what about further along the coast?

4125
04:21:28,740 --> 04:21:30,740
Any reports of survivors turning up?

4126
04:21:30,740 --> 04:21:33,740
No, I'm afraid not, Inspector. We haven't heard anything.

4127
04:21:33,740 --> 04:21:35,740
Well, tell me if you do.

4128
04:21:35,740 --> 04:21:37,740
Ah, Inspector.

4129
04:21:37,740 --> 04:21:38,740
Yes?

4130
04:21:38,740 --> 04:21:41,740
Ah, it seems to me it was a pirate ship that sunk.

4131
04:21:41,740 --> 04:21:43,740
What did you say?

4132
04:21:43,740 --> 04:21:48,740
Well, I'm pretty sure I saw the skull and crossbones flying from the mast.

4133
04:21:48,740 --> 04:21:52,740
And I think I caught sight of a cannon, but I could have been mistaken.

4134
04:21:52,740 --> 04:21:53,740
You must be joking.

4135
04:21:53,740 --> 04:21:54,740
I never joke.

4136
04:21:54,740 --> 04:22:00,740
I can't see anything. It's too far away to make out any sort of skull and crossbones.

4137
04:22:00,740 --> 04:22:01,740
Try this.

4138
04:22:01,740 --> 04:22:03,740
Ah, you've got a telescope.

4139
04:22:03,740 --> 04:22:06,740
Now why didn't you let me have this before? It might have helped.

4140
04:22:07,740 --> 04:22:08,740
Oh!

4141
04:22:22,740 --> 04:22:24,740
Ah, that's it. She's gone.

4142
04:22:30,740 --> 04:22:33,740
I suppose that there aren't many pirate ships around today.

4143
04:22:33,740 --> 04:22:38,740
Any that are afloat must be so old that they'd probably break up easily.

4144
04:22:38,740 --> 04:22:42,740
That's if it was a pirate ship, but it sure looked like one right enough.

4145
04:22:42,740 --> 04:22:45,740
Nothing's been washed up on the shore yet?

4146
04:22:45,740 --> 04:22:47,740
No, not a thing.

4147
04:22:50,740 --> 04:22:54,740
Isn't it strange that I was reading that book about pirates yesterday?

4148
04:22:54,740 --> 04:22:57,740
They probably wouldn't be quite so romantic in real life.

4149
04:22:57,740 --> 04:23:01,740
Well, in the book they were really great. I wish I'd been one.

4150
04:23:01,740 --> 04:23:02,740
A pirate?

4151
04:23:02,740 --> 04:23:04,740
Yeah, what could be more exciting?

4152
04:23:04,740 --> 04:23:06,740
You can't mean that.

4153
04:23:06,740 --> 04:23:12,740
Oh yes, I do. To sail across the seven seas, the holds of your ship's crammed with treasurers.

4154
04:23:12,740 --> 04:23:16,740
But you'd have to steal the treasure from somebody first, though, movement.

4155
04:23:16,740 --> 04:23:22,740
Well, yes, alright. I suppose so. But I wouldn't steal anything from anyone.

4156
04:23:22,740 --> 04:23:26,740
Ah, then you're just a sailor. Not a pirate at all.

4157
04:23:26,740 --> 04:23:33,740
Boom and mama, do you know where Moomin is?

4158
04:23:33,740 --> 04:23:36,740
He's probably in Snuffkin's tent.

4159
04:23:36,740 --> 04:23:37,740
Oh, yeah?

4160
04:23:37,740 --> 04:23:40,740
Snork maiden, I have a letter for you.

4161
04:23:40,740 --> 04:23:43,740
Yeah, you are. It's from the snork.

4162
04:23:43,740 --> 04:23:48,740
Oh, thank you. Wait a minute, little my. I want to read Snork's letter.

4163
04:23:48,740 --> 04:23:50,740
Take your time.

4164
04:23:57,740 --> 04:24:00,740
Oh, what's the matter?

4165
04:24:00,740 --> 04:24:03,740
It's Snork. He's coming home today.

4166
04:24:03,740 --> 04:24:04,740
That's nice.

4167
04:24:04,740 --> 04:24:07,740
But Moomin, mama, there's no food in the house at all.

4168
04:24:07,740 --> 04:24:10,740
Now, don't worry about that, Snork maiden.

4169
04:24:10,740 --> 04:24:14,740
I'll rustle up some dinner for us, and Snork can tell us all about his trip.

4170
04:24:14,740 --> 04:24:15,740
Boom and Papa like that.

4171
04:24:15,740 --> 04:24:19,740
Oh, thank you, mama. Snork doesn't like missing his meals.

4172
04:24:19,740 --> 04:24:22,740
He must have got the part sooner than he thought.

4173
04:24:22,740 --> 04:24:24,740
Ha, that's great news.

4174
04:24:24,740 --> 04:24:26,740
He should finish his flying ship soon, hey?

4175
04:24:26,740 --> 04:24:28,740
I guess so.

4176
04:24:28,740 --> 04:24:31,740
He should make it into a pirate flying ship.

4177
04:24:31,740 --> 04:24:36,740
I could be his first maid, and no one would be able to catch us. Nobody at all.

4178
04:24:36,740 --> 04:24:39,740
Ha, ha, ha.

4179
04:24:39,740 --> 04:24:41,740
Not here.

4180
04:24:41,740 --> 04:24:44,740
Oh, dear. I wonder where they've gone, little my.

4181
04:24:44,740 --> 04:24:47,740
There's nobody here.

4182
04:24:47,740 --> 04:24:50,740
Moomin probably wanted to go looking for an adventure.

4183
04:24:50,740 --> 04:24:54,740
I bet they went down to the beach to see if anything's been washed out.

4184
04:24:54,740 --> 04:24:56,740
At least the hangar's not been damaged.

4185
04:24:56,740 --> 04:25:00,740
Let's go down to the beach. We may find a treasure chest.

4186
04:25:00,740 --> 04:25:03,740
Huh?

4187
04:25:05,740 --> 04:25:07,740
What is it?

4188
04:25:07,740 --> 04:25:09,740
I just thought I heard something.

4189
04:25:09,740 --> 04:25:11,740
Where? From in there.

4190
04:25:11,740 --> 04:25:13,740
Hmm, weird.

4191
04:25:13,740 --> 04:25:16,740
Oh, I know. The snork must have come back.

4192
04:25:16,740 --> 04:25:19,740
Oh, yes. Snork. Of course.

4193
04:25:20,740 --> 04:25:23,740
Hello, snork.

4194
04:25:23,740 --> 04:25:26,740
Oh, snork. Are you in here?

4195
04:25:26,740 --> 04:25:28,740
Mm-hmm.

4196
04:25:28,740 --> 04:25:30,740
Ah!

4197
04:25:32,740 --> 04:25:35,740
Snork me.

4198
04:25:35,740 --> 04:25:37,740
Huh?

4199
04:25:41,740 --> 04:25:45,740
Put her down.

4200
04:25:45,740 --> 04:25:48,740
Oh, really? It was actually a pirate ship.

4201
04:25:48,740 --> 04:25:53,740
It was indeed Moomin Papa, and we caught the pirates when they swam ashore.

4202
04:25:53,740 --> 04:25:56,740
Do you think you captured all of them, Inspector?

4203
04:25:56,740 --> 04:26:00,740
Well, of course, we don't know exactly how many there were to begin with.

4204
04:26:00,740 --> 04:26:06,740
Hmm, right. I better barricade ourselves in Moomin House just to be on the safe side.

4205
04:26:06,740 --> 04:26:12,740
Oh, dear. And I suppose I ought to stand guard over my greenhouse as well.

4206
04:26:13,740 --> 04:26:18,740
Blast me, beansoles. Come here, you little pineapple.

4207
04:26:18,740 --> 04:26:22,740
Do let snork me go. You'll be sorry. You great big hairy folly.

4208
04:26:22,740 --> 04:26:27,740
No, not in your life. That won't just my hostage. I needed to make good my escape, but go.

4209
04:26:27,740 --> 04:26:30,740
Then you only have yourself to blame.

4210
04:26:30,740 --> 04:26:36,740
Hey, what? Blame? Stay where you are now. I will not be bitten again. Keep away a little cat.

4211
04:26:36,740 --> 04:26:38,740
Well, don't hurt her then.

4212
04:26:39,740 --> 04:26:44,740
Hurt her, you little shark. She's a hostage. Come me one at that. She'll be my safe passenger.

4213
04:26:44,740 --> 04:26:46,740
These rough waters are perished.

4214
04:26:46,740 --> 04:26:50,740
Well, then you better take me instead, because I'm much easier to carry.

4215
04:26:50,740 --> 04:26:54,740
You, huh? Nobody would care if I fed you slowly to the shrimps.

4216
04:26:54,740 --> 04:26:58,740
Oh, yes, lots of people. When you overstab win, babe.

4217
04:26:58,740 --> 04:27:02,740
All right, all right. Hold your head. We'd blow me down. No, what's your name, girl?

4218
04:27:02,740 --> 04:27:04,740
I'm Lil Mai.

4219
04:27:04,740 --> 04:27:08,740
I'm Captain Rumpod. Not going to get whatever authorities you have in this backwater.

4220
04:27:08,740 --> 04:27:10,740
Hurry, my patience is short.

4221
04:27:10,740 --> 04:27:14,740
I'll only go if you promise that you won't hurt snork maiden.

4222
04:27:14,740 --> 04:27:16,740
Of course I won't.

4223
04:27:16,740 --> 04:27:20,740
If I find that you've hurt her in any way at all, my revenge will be terrible.

4224
04:27:20,740 --> 04:27:23,740
All right, all right, all right.

4225
04:27:35,740 --> 04:27:39,740
Oh, boy.

4226
04:27:50,740 --> 04:27:56,740
Captain Rumpod, you are surrounded. Let snork maiden go. Do you hear me, Captain?

4227
04:27:56,740 --> 04:28:03,740
Do a gold button land lover like you never. She's a good-looking wench fair skinned and nicely rounded.

4228
04:28:03,740 --> 04:28:08,740
Pirates prefer blondes. Give me a ship and you can have her back.

4229
04:28:08,740 --> 04:28:11,740
What do you say to that, my buckhole?

4230
04:28:11,740 --> 04:28:16,740
You're on your own, Captain. We've got all your men locked up tight.

4231
04:28:16,740 --> 04:28:18,740
All me crew?

4232
04:28:18,740 --> 04:28:22,740
You're the last one. Now, let her go immediately.

4233
04:28:22,740 --> 04:28:26,740
Thank you for saving me crew. I feared they were all lost.

4234
04:28:26,740 --> 04:28:29,740
Don't thank me. They're all in jail.

4235
04:28:29,740 --> 04:28:33,740
Ah, someone said it's the best place for them, but not me.

4236
04:28:33,740 --> 04:28:36,740
Now let them out. I need them and a proper ship.

4237
04:28:36,740 --> 04:28:42,740
Oh, with two masks and fifty cannon and no tricks else it'll be worse for the girl.

4238
04:28:43,740 --> 04:28:46,740
This is too much.

4239
04:28:46,740 --> 04:28:49,740
The school for constables didn't tell us about this.

4240
04:28:49,740 --> 04:28:52,740
What should we do, Inspector?

4241
04:28:54,740 --> 04:28:56,740
Police gets snorked making away from him.

4242
04:28:56,740 --> 04:28:58,740
I'm afraid you'll hurt her and she'll be frightened.

4243
04:28:58,740 --> 04:29:01,740
I'm trying my best, but it's very awkward all this.

4244
04:29:01,740 --> 04:29:04,740
I've not come across anything like it before.

4245
04:29:04,740 --> 04:29:07,740
Oh, but it's not her fault that his ship sank, Inspector.

4246
04:29:07,740 --> 04:29:10,740
I know, I know. Oh, dear, oh dear.

4247
04:29:10,740 --> 04:29:13,740
Oh, I should have been a gardener.

4248
04:29:13,740 --> 04:29:16,740
Hey, are you still there, you ruffian?

4249
04:29:16,740 --> 04:29:21,740
Let my men go and get my ship. Two masks and fifty cannon mines.

4250
04:29:21,740 --> 04:29:25,740
Look, Captain Rumpod, I'm afraid the times have changed.

4251
04:29:25,740 --> 04:29:28,740
Sailing ships don't have cannon these days.

4252
04:29:28,740 --> 04:29:31,740
Shiver me timbers. How do you sink each other then?

4253
04:29:31,740 --> 04:29:34,740
I don't try to fool me. Remember, I've got the girl.

4254
04:29:34,740 --> 04:29:38,740
I think Moomin Papa has an old blender bus I'm sure he'll let you have.

4255
04:29:38,740 --> 04:29:41,740
I don't know if it'll work, though. That's all I've got.

4256
04:29:41,740 --> 04:29:45,740
I'm one of you, Peabrain. This is my final word, so listen well.

4257
04:29:45,740 --> 04:29:50,740
You have two hours to get the ship ready to sail and all my crew with her mine.

4258
04:29:50,740 --> 04:29:52,740
Or else I'll...

4259
04:29:52,740 --> 04:29:55,740
Now, don't worry, my pretty one. I won't have a single hair on your head,

4260
04:29:55,740 --> 04:29:58,740
but I must have something to threaten them with.

4261
04:29:58,740 --> 04:30:03,740
Or else I'll feed her to the hungry shark.

4262
04:30:03,740 --> 04:30:06,740
Oscar, I won't hurt you.

4263
04:30:06,740 --> 04:30:07,740
Are you sure?

4264
04:30:07,740 --> 04:30:11,740
Either I get my ship, Oak, fifty cannon, and at least two masters.

4265
04:30:11,740 --> 04:30:15,740
She'll be food for lobsters. It's your choice, my husband.

4266
04:30:15,740 --> 04:30:17,740
That should do it.

4267
04:30:19,740 --> 04:30:21,740
He sounds as if he'll do it, too.

4268
04:30:21,740 --> 04:30:26,740
Two hours, he says, a real feeder to the shark. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

4269
04:30:26,740 --> 04:30:30,740
What will Snork say, oh, dear, oh, dear?

4270
04:30:32,740 --> 04:30:34,740
I have a great idea, sir.

4271
04:30:34,740 --> 04:30:38,740
Why don't we climb onto the roof, drill a hole, and then drop something on his head?

4272
04:30:38,740 --> 04:30:43,740
You know, Constable, I've always thought you were an idiot, and now you've proved it.

4273
04:30:43,740 --> 04:30:45,740
Excuse me, Inspector.

4274
04:30:45,740 --> 04:30:49,740
If we set fire to the hangar, then they'll have to come out, won't they?

4275
04:30:49,740 --> 04:30:53,740
Shut up! Why am I surrounded by fools?

4276
04:30:53,740 --> 04:30:55,740
Oh, this is no good.

4277
04:30:55,740 --> 04:30:59,740
I must calm down, I must calm down.

4278
04:30:59,740 --> 04:31:01,740
Captain Rumbot!

4279
04:31:01,740 --> 04:31:03,740
Can you hear me, Captain?

4280
04:31:03,740 --> 04:31:06,740
Aha, you found a ship already, have you?

4281
04:31:06,740 --> 04:31:10,740
Well, no, there aren't any real sailing ships in Moomin Valley.

4282
04:31:10,740 --> 04:31:12,740
The chief Constable has a yacht.

4283
04:31:12,740 --> 04:31:16,740
He doesn't usually let anyone borrow it, but I'm sure in this case he...

4284
04:31:16,740 --> 04:31:20,740
I want something big enough to take me to the Spanish main, I warn you!

4285
04:31:20,740 --> 04:31:24,740
To calm down, Captain, calm down, now just listen to me.

4286
04:31:24,740 --> 04:31:28,740
You haven't done anything wrong here, no pirating or such like,

4287
04:31:28,740 --> 04:31:32,740
so if you forget about the boat, we'll let you all go, think about it.

4288
04:31:32,740 --> 04:31:35,740
Three to go anywhere you like, on foot, of course.

4289
04:31:35,740 --> 04:31:41,740
The fresh air, the sun on your face, no worry of shipwrecks, no storms at sea.

4290
04:31:41,740 --> 04:31:43,740
What do you think we are?

4291
04:31:43,740 --> 04:31:45,740
Huh, we're pirates, not high-wamen.

4292
04:31:45,740 --> 04:31:48,740
It's not so bad being a high-wamen, you know?

4293
04:31:48,740 --> 04:31:51,740
There'll be lots of rich travelers on the other side of Lonely Mountain,

4294
04:31:51,740 --> 04:31:54,740
I'm sure, and lots of adventures with jewels and gold.

4295
04:31:54,740 --> 04:31:58,740
Day me with flagens are rubbed your chicken brain, nitwit!

4296
04:31:58,740 --> 04:31:59,740
Nitwit?

4297
04:31:59,740 --> 04:32:01,740
No, niggum poop, dumb bill!

4298
04:32:01,740 --> 04:32:02,740
I'm Captain Rumbot!

4299
04:32:02,740 --> 04:32:04,740
You're making me very angry!

4300
04:32:04,740 --> 04:32:07,740
If I had you on my ship, you'd dangle from the yard!

4301
04:32:07,740 --> 04:32:09,740
I'm yet to walk the blade!

4302
04:32:09,740 --> 04:32:11,740
The inspectors lose control.

4303
04:32:11,740 --> 04:32:13,740
We had better calm him down.

4304
04:32:14,740 --> 04:32:16,740
What the crank would I?

4305
04:32:16,740 --> 04:32:19,740
And in my prison, you'd get no butter in their bread,

4306
04:32:19,740 --> 04:32:21,740
and maggots on your biscuits!

4307
04:32:22,740 --> 04:32:23,740
Please calm down, sister.

4308
04:32:23,740 --> 04:32:24,740
Please calm down, sister.

4309
04:32:24,740 --> 04:32:25,740
Calm down.

4310
04:32:25,740 --> 04:32:26,740
Calm down, take care.

4311
04:32:26,740 --> 04:32:27,740
Be easy.

4312
04:32:27,740 --> 04:32:28,740
Are you sure?

4313
04:32:28,740 --> 04:32:29,740
We water!

4314
04:32:29,740 --> 04:32:32,740
I'd see through it that the bread was milled!

4315
04:32:37,740 --> 04:32:40,740
That's 30 minutes gone already!

4316
04:32:44,740 --> 04:32:46,740
I warned you, gold button.

4317
04:32:46,740 --> 04:32:49,740
Now there is only one hour to her painful and horrible death!

4318
04:32:52,740 --> 04:32:54,740
Cheer up, Snark Maiden!

4319
04:32:54,740 --> 04:32:56,740
Try and hold on!

4320
04:32:56,740 --> 04:32:58,740
We'll get you out!

4321
04:32:58,740 --> 04:32:59,740
Water?

4322
04:32:59,740 --> 04:33:00,740
Water?

4323
04:33:00,740 --> 04:33:01,740
Huh?

4324
04:33:01,740 --> 04:33:02,740
What did you say?

4325
04:33:02,740 --> 04:33:03,740
Water, please.

4326
04:33:03,740 --> 04:33:05,740
I'm so thirsty.

4327
04:33:05,740 --> 04:33:06,740
Water?

4328
04:33:06,740 --> 04:33:07,740
Nasty?

4329
04:33:07,740 --> 04:33:08,740
I'm thirsty.

4330
04:33:08,740 --> 04:33:09,740
Water?

4331
04:33:09,740 --> 04:33:10,740
Nasty?

4332
04:33:10,740 --> 04:33:11,740
I'm thirsty.

4333
04:33:11,740 --> 04:33:12,740
Water?

4334
04:33:12,740 --> 04:33:14,740
Nasty stuff, still.

4335
04:33:15,740 --> 04:33:17,740
Hey, land lovers!

4336
04:33:17,740 --> 04:33:18,740
Compliments to the galley!

4337
04:33:18,740 --> 04:33:20,740
The young lady wants a drink!

4338
04:33:20,740 --> 04:33:21,740
All right, captain.

4339
04:33:21,740 --> 04:33:23,740
I'm coming, Snark Maiden.

4340
04:33:24,740 --> 04:33:25,740
I'll take it, Inspector.

4341
04:33:25,740 --> 04:33:27,740
It's too dangerous.

4342
04:33:27,740 --> 04:33:29,740
You must leave it to us now, moment.

4343
04:33:29,740 --> 04:33:31,740
Just a minute, Inspector.

4344
04:33:31,740 --> 04:33:33,740
I think we should let Moomin go,

4345
04:33:33,740 --> 04:33:35,740
and I've got an idea that just might work.

4346
04:33:35,740 --> 04:33:36,740
Snark him!

4347
04:33:37,740 --> 04:33:38,740
It'll take an awful lot of courage,

4348
04:33:38,740 --> 04:33:40,740
and you'll have to do it all on your own.

4349
04:33:40,740 --> 04:33:42,740
Do you think you can do it, Moomin?

4350
04:33:42,740 --> 04:33:43,740
Of course.

4351
04:33:48,740 --> 04:33:49,740
Splice me, mate.

4352
04:33:49,740 --> 04:33:51,740
Raise what's taken him so long.

4353
04:33:51,740 --> 04:33:53,740
Keep it a young lady in waiting.

4354
04:33:53,740 --> 04:33:54,740
It's all right.

4355
04:33:54,740 --> 04:33:56,740
I really don't mind waiting.

4356
04:33:56,740 --> 04:33:57,740
Tell you the truth.

4357
04:33:57,740 --> 04:33:59,740
I can do it and drink myself.

4358
04:33:59,740 --> 04:34:00,740
It's thirsty work.

4359
04:34:00,740 --> 04:34:01,740
Shouting at idiot policeman.

4360
04:34:01,740 --> 04:34:02,740
Don't you worry, little one.

4361
04:34:02,740 --> 04:34:04,740
They'll be here soon.

4362
04:34:05,740 --> 04:34:07,740
Get me a drink, too!

4363
04:34:07,740 --> 04:34:08,740
You hear it!

4364
04:34:08,740 --> 04:34:09,740
Quick about it!

4365
04:34:09,740 --> 04:34:12,740
I've brought you something to drink, Captain.

4366
04:34:13,740 --> 04:34:15,740
Right, come on, then.

4367
04:34:15,740 --> 04:34:17,740
And no funny stuff.

4368
04:34:17,740 --> 04:34:19,740
Don't worry. I'm on my own.

4369
04:34:20,740 --> 04:34:22,740
Have you done a drink for me, too?

4370
04:34:22,740 --> 04:34:23,740
Yes, Captain.

4371
04:34:23,740 --> 04:34:26,740
All right. Stay there and put down the train.

4372
04:34:28,740 --> 04:34:30,740
The bigger one is for you, Captain.

4373
04:34:30,740 --> 04:34:32,740
And the little one for Snark, mate.

4374
04:34:32,740 --> 04:34:34,740
Now move away.

4375
04:34:35,740 --> 04:34:37,740
And for enough, stay there.

4376
04:34:40,740 --> 04:34:43,740
Hmm. Why is it so red?

4377
04:34:44,740 --> 04:34:46,740
Well, it's strawberry juice.

4378
04:34:46,740 --> 04:34:48,740
It's very good.

4379
04:34:52,740 --> 04:34:53,740
I'll be polite.

4380
04:34:53,740 --> 04:34:56,740
She can drink from this one and I'll have hers.

4381
04:34:56,740 --> 04:34:59,740
But, Captain, there's not enough for you in the small one.

4382
04:35:00,740 --> 04:35:03,740
Strawberry juice isn't exactly my favorite tip of your know.

4383
04:35:03,740 --> 04:35:05,740
No, the small one will do.

4384
04:35:06,740 --> 04:35:08,740
Here you are, young lady.

4385
04:35:09,740 --> 04:35:12,740
No, no, Snark, mate. And please, don't drink it.

4386
04:35:13,740 --> 04:35:16,740
Why not, my young bucko? It's not poison, is it?

4387
04:35:16,740 --> 04:35:18,740
Don't be silly. Poisoned.

4388
04:35:18,740 --> 04:35:19,740
Oh, no, no.

4389
04:35:19,740 --> 04:35:21,740
Perhaps a sleeping potion.

4390
04:35:23,740 --> 04:35:25,740
Hmm. As I thought.

4391
04:35:25,740 --> 04:35:29,740
I deemed in mighty strange that two cups were prepared.

4392
04:35:29,740 --> 04:35:30,740
You drink it.

4393
04:35:30,740 --> 04:35:33,740
Oh, no, no, no, sir. I'm not thirsty at all.

4394
04:35:34,740 --> 04:35:37,740
What's the matter, Miland? You said the drink wasn't poisoned, didn't you?

4395
04:35:38,740 --> 04:35:39,740
So, drink!

4396
04:35:39,740 --> 04:35:40,740
Movement?

4397
04:35:40,740 --> 04:35:42,740
Ah, you're her swing, are you?

4398
04:35:43,740 --> 04:35:45,740
I shall never understand women anyway.

4399
04:35:45,740 --> 04:35:48,740
One of you will have to drink it, and now!

4400
04:35:49,740 --> 04:35:52,740
Not far, I'll do it. I'll do it. Give it to me.

4401
04:35:52,740 --> 04:35:56,740
No, movement, don't. There's something in it. You'll be poisoned.

4402
04:35:56,740 --> 04:35:59,740
It's all right, Snark, mate. It's nothing dangerous.

4403
04:35:59,740 --> 04:36:01,740
Don't worry about me.

4404
04:36:01,740 --> 04:36:02,740
I'll drink it.

4405
04:36:03,740 --> 04:36:05,740
Oh.

4406
04:36:05,740 --> 04:36:08,740
That's it. Drink up again.

4407
04:36:12,740 --> 04:36:14,740
Down the hatch, Miland.

4408
04:36:16,740 --> 04:36:18,740
You're lucky it wasn't poisoned.

4409
04:36:19,740 --> 04:36:20,740
Yeah.

4410
04:36:21,740 --> 04:36:23,740
And no sleeping potion, neither?

4411
04:36:23,740 --> 04:36:27,740
Oh, no. Nothing at all. Nothing.

4412
04:36:28,740 --> 04:36:32,740
Oh, movement! Oh, no, movement!

4413
04:36:32,740 --> 04:36:34,740
You're not my pretty one.

4414
04:36:34,740 --> 04:36:39,740
Your wimpy little bow is just taking a nap. You'll be right as rain's soon.

4415
04:36:43,740 --> 04:36:45,740
And he thought he could fool me.

4416
04:36:45,740 --> 04:36:48,740
Me, Captain Rumpot, but she can't.

4417
04:36:48,740 --> 04:36:50,740
Well, I'll have the other one.

4418
04:36:54,740 --> 04:36:55,740
Not bad.

4419
04:36:56,740 --> 04:36:58,740
No, I'm sorry, young lady.

4420
04:36:58,740 --> 04:37:00,740
They'll have to bring you another.

4421
04:37:00,740 --> 04:37:03,740
Shall we order one without the draft?

4422
04:37:03,740 --> 04:37:06,740
They'll be surprised when they see me still on my pins.

4423
04:37:07,740 --> 04:37:10,740
Why do I not sleep at all?

4424
04:37:12,740 --> 04:37:14,740
Let's go and give my surprise, huh?

4425
04:37:15,740 --> 04:37:16,740
Oh.

4426
04:37:17,740 --> 04:37:18,740
Oh.

4427
04:37:22,740 --> 04:37:23,740
Oh.

4428
04:37:23,740 --> 04:37:25,740
Yay!

4429
04:37:27,740 --> 04:37:29,740
A moment!

4430
04:37:29,740 --> 04:37:32,740
It's all right. I'm okay, Snorgmaiden.

4431
04:37:32,740 --> 04:37:35,740
There's nothing in this drink. Would you like some?

4432
04:37:35,740 --> 04:37:37,740
A moment. You mean you?

4433
04:37:37,740 --> 04:37:40,740
Well, I was pretending. So I convinced you too, huh?

4434
04:37:40,740 --> 04:37:42,740
A moment!

4435
04:37:47,740 --> 04:37:51,740
Captain Rumpot didn't wake up that day, or the next.

4436
04:37:51,740 --> 04:37:56,740
And when he did, he had a terrible headache, which served him right.

4437
04:38:03,740 --> 04:38:06,740
The inspector let all the pirates go after a week.

4438
04:38:06,740 --> 04:38:09,740
Well, they hadn't done any pirating in Moomin Valley,

4439
04:38:09,740 --> 04:38:13,740
and wouldn't be doing any either, not without a ship.

4440
04:38:16,740 --> 04:38:17,740
I'm sorry.

4441
04:38:17,740 --> 04:38:18,740
I'm sorry.

4442
04:38:18,740 --> 04:38:19,740
I'm sorry.

4443
04:38:19,740 --> 04:38:20,740
I'm sorry.

4444
04:38:20,740 --> 04:38:21,740
I'm sorry.

4445
04:38:21,740 --> 04:38:22,740
I'm sorry.

4446
04:38:22,740 --> 04:38:23,740
I'm sorry.

4447
04:38:23,740 --> 04:38:24,740
I'm sorry.

4448
04:38:24,740 --> 04:38:25,740
I'm sorry.

4449
04:38:25,740 --> 04:38:26,740
I'm sorry.

4450
04:38:26,740 --> 04:38:27,740
I'm sorry.

4451
04:38:27,740 --> 04:38:28,740
I'm sorry.

4452
04:38:28,740 --> 04:38:29,740
I'm sorry.

4453
04:38:29,740 --> 04:38:30,740
I'm sorry.

4454
04:38:30,740 --> 04:38:31,740
I'm sorry.

4455
04:38:31,740 --> 04:38:32,740
I'm sorry.

4456
04:38:32,740 --> 04:38:33,740
I'm sorry.

4457
04:38:33,740 --> 04:38:34,740
I'm sorry.

4458
04:38:34,740 --> 04:38:35,740
I'm sorry.

4459
04:38:35,740 --> 04:38:36,740
I'm sorry.

4460
04:38:36,740 --> 04:38:37,740
I'm sorry.

4461
04:38:37,740 --> 04:38:38,740
I'm sorry.

4462
04:38:38,740 --> 04:38:39,740
I'm sorry.

4463
04:38:39,740 --> 04:38:40,740
I'm sorry.

4464
04:38:40,740 --> 04:38:41,740
I'm sorry.

4465
04:38:41,740 --> 04:38:42,740
I'm sorry.

4466
04:38:42,740 --> 04:38:43,740
I'm sorry.

4467
04:38:43,740 --> 04:38:44,740
I'm sorry.

4468
04:38:44,740 --> 04:38:45,740
I'm sorry.

4469
04:38:45,740 --> 04:38:46,740
I'm sorry.

4470
04:38:46,740 --> 04:38:47,740
I'm sorry.

4471
04:38:47,740 --> 04:38:48,740
I'm sorry.

4472
04:38:48,740 --> 04:38:49,740
I'm sorry.

4473
04:38:49,740 --> 04:38:50,740
I'm sorry.

4474
04:38:50,740 --> 04:38:51,740
I'm sorry.

4475
04:38:51,740 --> 04:38:52,740
I'm sorry.

4476
04:38:52,740 --> 04:38:53,740
I'm sorry.

4477
04:38:53,740 --> 04:38:54,740
I'm sorry.

4478
04:38:54,740 --> 04:38:55,740
I'm sorry.

4479
04:38:55,740 --> 04:38:56,740
I'm sorry.

4480
04:38:56,740 --> 04:38:57,740
I'm sorry.

4481
04:38:57,740 --> 04:38:58,740
I'm sorry.

4482
04:38:58,740 --> 04:38:59,740
I'm sorry.

4483
04:38:59,740 --> 04:39:00,740
I'm sorry.

4484
04:39:00,740 --> 04:39:01,740
I'm sorry.

4485
04:39:01,740 --> 04:39:02,740
I'm sorry.

4486
04:39:02,740 --> 04:39:03,740
I'm sorry.

4487
04:39:03,740 --> 04:39:04,740
I'm sorry.

4488
04:39:04,740 --> 04:39:05,740
I'm sorry.

4489
04:39:05,740 --> 04:39:06,740
I'm sorry.

4490
04:39:06,740 --> 04:39:07,740
I'm sorry.

4491
04:39:07,740 --> 04:39:08,740
I'm sorry.

4492
04:39:08,740 --> 04:39:09,740
I'm sorry.

4493
04:39:09,740 --> 04:39:10,740
I'm sorry.

4494
04:39:10,740 --> 04:39:11,740
I'm sorry.

4495
04:39:11,740 --> 04:39:12,740
I'm sorry.

4496
04:39:12,740 --> 04:39:13,740
I'm sorry.

4497
04:39:13,740 --> 04:39:14,740
I'm sorry.

4498
04:39:14,740 --> 04:39:15,740
I'm sorry.

4499
04:39:15,740 --> 04:39:16,740
I'm sorry.

4500
04:39:16,740 --> 04:39:17,740
I'm sorry.

4501
04:39:17,740 --> 04:39:18,740
I'm sorry.

4502
04:39:18,740 --> 04:39:19,740
I'm sorry.

4503
04:39:19,740 --> 04:39:20,740
I'm sorry.

4504
04:39:20,740 --> 04:39:21,740
I'm sorry.

4505
04:39:21,740 --> 04:39:22,740
I'm sorry.

4506
04:39:22,740 --> 04:39:23,740
