WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Off we go then, Hank is away, he won't have to road too hard, the wind will pick us up soon.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Goodbye, have a good time, everyone.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Goodbye, Snuffkin, now don't forget to shut all the windows if it rains, will you?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
No.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Up towards!

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hey! Wait for me, I want to have a good time too!

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Hey, wait!

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Look, Snuff is still waving.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
He's a sweet boy.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Let's keep waving, Moonman, till we're out of sight.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Bye, Snuffkin! Bye, bye!

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Bye!

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
No, I'm not waving goodbye, I want to go too!

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Don't eat all the road, Mary Tabo, we're gone!

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
It's no good shouting little Mai, he can't hear you.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
He's giving us a great send-off though, for Snuff, he should have come with us.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Nancy, I'm going off and leaving me here on my own.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Snuffkin, if you wouldn't mind, I think we need some music to send us on our way.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
What do you say?

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Are you sure we're on the right course for the island, Papa?

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Yes, the winds with us and the sails are fine.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
I bet if we keep this speed up, we'll be there by tomorrow.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Well, if the wind stays like this, you could be right.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
The wind's not dying down at all.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
I'm surprised, I never thought we'd keep up this speed.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Now make sure you're allergic.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
Of course we will be, Papa, if we carry on like this, perhaps we'll see the light from the lighthouse while it's still dark.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Well, we don't want to hit anything at this speed.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Don't worry, we're watching.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Ah, this is the light.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Papa, the wind's dropped.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Well, that's strange, it shouldn't happen that quickly.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Do you want us to start rowing, Moomin, Papa?

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
No, Snuffkin, I think we'd better get some sleep.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Stupid wind, I really wanted to see the lighthouse at night.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
It's getting foggy too.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I can't even see the stars anymore.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Right, Snuffkin, wake me in two hours and I'll take over.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Okay, Moomin, Papa.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
What's the matter, Little My?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I thought I heard something.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
It's coming from over there somewhere.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Can you see anything?

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
No, but I can hear it.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
It's so good eye, and it's getting closer.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Little Moomin, Papa, get up, Moomin!

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Stop it, Little My! What's the matter with you?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
You too, Moomin, quickly, before it's too late!

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
What's the matter, Little My?

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
I can hear her ship, I can't see it, but it's very close and getting closer.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
A ship? Where?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Over there, and she's bearing down on us.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Quickly, we don't have much time.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Yes, by the boobalier right.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
We must let them know we're here, a signal.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Right, all hands on deck.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Maybe if we all shout as loud as we can.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Look!

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Oh!

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Too late for shouting!

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
It's huge!

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Look out! It's gonna hit us!

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I think Moomin's right, what can we do?

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
It's too late for anything, just brace ourselves and be ready to swim for it.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Quick, get down, Little My!

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Oh!

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I don't believe it!

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Little My!

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Huh?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
That's hard, the ship didn't hit us.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Oh yes, he did!

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
What?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
It went straight into our rudder when nothing happened!

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
It went right through us!

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Right through us, that's impossible she couldn't have.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I wonder if there was anyone on board that ship.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I can't see any lights.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
I know, Snuffkin, I think it's a ghost ship.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
A ghost ship?

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Well, there's no wash and no damage to us.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
It's the only explanation, I think she's right.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
A ghost ship, we've actually seen one.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Oh dear, oh dear, I need to sit down, all this excitement's too much.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
Papa, don't they say that if you see a ghost ship, something terrible is gonna happen to you?

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
What happened in the first place to make it become a ghost ship? That's what I wanna know.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Well, that's just some old sailor's tail, Moomin.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
If it had been a real ship, we'd probably be sinking now.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Don't you think so, Snuffkin?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah, I suppose.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
That's one way of looking at it.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Come on, cheer up you guys, at least it was fun.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
What's the matter?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Has something happened?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
What are you laughing at?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
What's so funny?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Are you going to tell us?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Why didn't you wake me up, Moomin?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Oh!

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Well, I think we're doing very well.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
We're doing very well.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
We're doing very well.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Oh!

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Well, I think we're doing very well.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Oh, what a beautiful sky, just look at it.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Oh, the fog is lifting.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Oh, what's it dozed off?

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Another beautiful day, not a ghost ship in sight.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
The lighthouse.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Hey, wake up everybody, the lighthouse.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
I can see the lighthouse we're there.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Oh, the sun shining, we must have slept for hours.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Oh, there it is.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
This is ridiculous.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
We've been next to it all night.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
We could have gone and slept there.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I can't wait to go ashore.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
All right, everyone, jump to it.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Man the old.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
There's something strange going on here.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
What is it, Snuffkin?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
I'm not sure.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Moomin Papa.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Our boat didn't move at all last night, did it?

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
No, it doesn't seem to have moved at all.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
So why couldn't we see the light from the lighthouse,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
even when the fog cleared?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I can't work it out.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Yes, you're right, Snuffkin, it seems very odd.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
We should have seen it.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Well, perhaps the lighthouse keeper forgot to put it on, Moomin Papa.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I don't think so, little Mai.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
You can't forget a thing like that.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
I suppose it could be broken.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
There could be lots of reasons for it.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Why don't we hurry up and get ashore,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
and then we can ask the keeper.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Look, there's someone in a boat.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Hmm.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
It looks like he's fishing.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
He know about the lighthouse.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
He probably lives on the island.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Let's get closer.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Easy now.

09:09.000 --> 09:18.000
Now, hoi there, good morning.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Any luck?

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
Not yet, but it's still early.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Hmm, yes, quite.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I'll ask him straight out.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Do you know if the lighthouse was working last night?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I don't know.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
He said, no, it wasn't.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
What did I tell you?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
He forgot to light it.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Oh, it wasn't only last night.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
You'll never see a light in that lighthouse.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Not even on stormy nights.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
We'll never.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
So what does the keeper do then?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Nothing.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
There is an lighthouse keeper.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Why?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
I'm sorry.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
I'm afraid I don't know.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
All I can say is I haven't seen one.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Do you live on the island?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Hey, mister.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
You're asking too many questions.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Who are you?

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
I'm Moment Papa from Moment Valley, and this is my family.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
We've come a long way in order to do some important work here.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
No work on this island.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
No, you better go back home.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
You see, I've come here to research an epic novel about the sea.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Just turn around and go back.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
You're too far from home.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Oh, please, wait.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Shh.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Dear, don't shout.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
We mustn't scare the fish away.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Let's go a show and have some breakfast.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I expect we're all hungry.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Bunny, pair.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
The old ones lost his marbles.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
The old ones lost his marbles.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
The old ones lost his marbles.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
The old ones lost his marbles.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
The old ones lost his marbles.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
The old ones lost his marbles.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
The old ones lost his marbles.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Look, Moment Papa. There's a path here leading to the lighthouse.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
We'll leave this stuff here and we'll go and explore it first.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Right, to the lighthouse, everyone.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Up, bow.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Come on!

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
What's wrong?

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
Why do you always get so upset when somebody mentions the lighthouse?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
It's not your call, sir.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Business boy doesn't concern you at all.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
You were like that when I asked you about it before.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
Maybe if you were to tell me, I might be able to understand.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I could try anyway.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Either talk about something else or keep quiet.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
You understand that?

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
It's so very rocky, I don't think it would work.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
What? A garden.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Hello there!

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Is there anybody at home?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
There's nobody here.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
That boy was right. It's been empty for ages, I think.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
Oh, the door was left unlocked. I know we do it, but most people don't.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Something terrible's happened.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
Something terrible! Please, little my, you know I had things like that.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Don't worry, snort maiden.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Little my, it's just trying to scare you.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I don't like hearing about anything horrible.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
Flag your ears then, snort maiden, because I haven't finished yet.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
And the next bit's really horrible.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Oh, well, where have you been finished there?

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Well, the lighthouse keeper is still up there.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
He got scurvy and hats and been able to move for months.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
And nobody's heard his cries for help.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
And with no food, he's almost a skeleton.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
If he isn't dead already, he'll be at the top of the stairs, crawling towards his fingers,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
lading and ripped up ribbons and flowers, mouth.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
God, it's endless, mouth.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Shut up, little my.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
That's enough.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
It was a good imagination though.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I'll let you use it in your book, if you like.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Come on, tell me what did she say, Moonman?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Oh, nothing, really. Nothing at all.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Tell me, Moonman, but leave out the bits I wouldn't like.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
Where are you going, Papa?

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Well, listen, everyone.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
First, I'm going to get the lamp working.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
Then we'll give the place a good clean and then we'll move in.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
We'll be the new lighthouse keepers.

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
And once again, the seas around this island will be safe for ships to navigate in troubled water.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Come on, Papa!

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Careful, careful.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Touch anything, that's dangerous.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Oh!

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Will Moonman Papa be able to get the light working again?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Where is the lighthouse keeper?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
And what could have made him go without locking the door,

14:21.000 --> 14:27.000
leaving the ships in peril and the seas with no one to guide them away from the rocks?

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
And who is the mysterious fisherman?

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the moments.

14:41.000 --> 14:49.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
They're always happy and always at play.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
The movements.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
The movements.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

15:11.000 --> 15:19.000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
They're always happy and always at play.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
The movements are having fun day after day.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
The movements.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
The movements.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
The movements.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Here they are for one and all.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
The movements are about to come.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
Come on and sit down here with me.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
They're here for you on your TV.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
They are the movements.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
They are the movements.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
So come with me.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Give me your hand.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I'll take you up to a moment land.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
You can fly just like a bird.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Sing that song ever.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
There were the movements.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
There were the movements.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
There were the movements.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
There were the movements.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
There were the movements.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
There were the movements.

17:01.000 --> 17:26.840
The movements came to this island to visit a real lighthouse, but when they got there,

17:26.840 --> 17:34.840
I found it was completely deserted, no light, and no lighthouse keeper.

17:34.840 --> 17:43.840
Woman Papa is going to try and mend the lamp, and the others are all helping to clean up.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.840
This is it, then. Do you think it's broken, Papa?

17:46.840 --> 17:55.840
Well, I'm not sure. I've not had a great deal of experience with this sort of thing.

17:55.840 --> 18:00.840
Look over there, woman. It's the boy and the fisherman from the boat.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.840
They're a bit strange, aren't they?

18:02.840 --> 18:05.840
They must live somewhere here on the island.

18:05.840 --> 18:10.840
Hmm, let's see. Let's see.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.840
Oh, my God.

18:15.840 --> 18:28.840
Oh, thank you. Leave it by the door when you haven't quite finished yet.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.840
Well, at least we can see the floor now.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.840
I think the keeper must be lying dead under the dust.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.840
Nobody's cleaned here for a long time, that's for sure.

18:38.840 --> 18:42.840
That probably means the lighthouse lamp hasn't been working for ages either.

18:43.840 --> 18:46.840
I wonder if Papa will be able to fix it.

18:46.840 --> 18:52.840
I wonder if they're going to manage to get the light working all right.

18:52.840 --> 19:00.840
Well, the lighthouse without a lamp is pretty sad, isn't it?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.840
Come on, light, will you?

19:02.840 --> 19:08.840
Right, I'll give you one last chance.

19:08.840 --> 19:13.840
Then I'm getting the big spanner. Now, you don't know me, but I don't give in easily, especially to machines.

19:13.840 --> 19:22.840
Have you thought, brass brain, what will happen tonight if there's a storm and there's a ship out there looking for land or trying to keep off the rocks and there's no light to guide them?

19:22.840 --> 19:24.840
You'll be sorry, Dan, but it'll be too late.

19:24.840 --> 19:28.840
And all I can say is that if the light hasn't been working for some time,

19:28.840 --> 19:31.840
then I'm afraid that there could have been many shipwrecks.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.840
Oh, that's awful.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.840
It would be dangerous to come too close to the island without a light to help you.

19:37.840 --> 19:41.840
I wouldn't be surprised if that ghost ship went one of them.

19:41.840 --> 19:47.840
It all seems very strange, and I wonder what made the lighthouse keeper leave in such a hurry.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.840
Unspeakable horror, please be quiet, little my.

19:50.840 --> 19:51.840
It's obvious.

19:51.840 --> 19:55.840
Close thrown above dishes left unwashed, jigsaw puzzles have finished.

19:55.840 --> 19:59.840
It's an unsolved mystery of the sea, just like the Marie Celeste.

19:59.840 --> 20:03.840
And if you don't understand that, then you're being even stupider.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.840
Then usual.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.840
Oh dear poor man, I wonder what he was like.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.840
He must have been very lonely here on his own.

20:12.840 --> 20:16.840
He scribbled messages over the walls like no side of a ship.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.840
It's Christmas, another month gone.

20:18.840 --> 20:24.840
I must clean the lamp, and I need to talk to someone.

20:24.840 --> 20:29.840
Oh, well, if he didn't see many ships, at least they could have been many shipwrecks either.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.840
Oh, I hope not Papa.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.840
That would be one good thing anyway.

20:33.840 --> 20:38.840
Perhaps the sea came and took him on a dark and stormy night, and he was swept out, and no one saw him go.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.840
That's rubbish, little my.

20:40.840 --> 20:45.840
On dark and stormy nights, lighthouse keeper sits safe by a fire drinking hot tea laced with rum.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.840
He might have run out of rum and gone to get more.

20:48.840 --> 20:51.840
Well, I don't think anything terrible happened to him.

20:51.840 --> 20:55.840
He just got more and more lonely and fed up, and then went off and got a girlfriend.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.840
Be careful, snuffkin.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.840
It's very rough and not even, and you don't want to fall into the sea.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.840
I certainly don't.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.840
Now, watch your step. The rocks are very slippery.

21:05.840 --> 21:08.840
Are you alright?

21:08.840 --> 21:12.840
Yes, Lang, so I didn't think they'd be a slippery as all that.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.840
What's the matter?

21:14.840 --> 21:17.840
Look over there. There's something moving, but I can't see what it is.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.840
It's probably a boat.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.840
No, that's what I call a real ship.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.840
It's not a real one.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.840
What do you mean?

21:26.840 --> 21:29.840
It's the ghost ship, the one we saw last night.

21:29.840 --> 21:34.840
You're right. Why isn't it come back snuffkin? What does it want?

21:34.840 --> 21:39.840
I don't know. Perhaps it followed us to the island and for some reason wants to make contact.

21:39.840 --> 21:49.840
Let's go home snuffkin. I don't like this.

22:10.840 --> 22:14.840
What's up?

22:14.840 --> 22:18.840
I'm having a great dream and you can be with me.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.840
Oh, it was horrible. Someone stepped on my face.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.840
Well, none of us sleep.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.840
We were all asleep. What are you doing?

22:25.840 --> 22:27.840
It's very odd.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.840
No, somebody's on my stomach now.

22:33.840 --> 22:36.840
Don't be stupid.

22:36.840 --> 22:41.840
Oh, I have a look snuffkin. There must be something there. Please snuffkin, please.

22:41.840 --> 22:44.840
I can't see any.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.840
What's that?

22:46.840 --> 22:47.840
What is it?

22:47.840 --> 22:51.840
I don't know yet, movement. I think I can see a pair of feet.

22:51.840 --> 22:52.840
A pair of feet.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.840
No legs, just feet.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.840
But that means a ghost.

22:56.840 --> 22:59.840
Oh, help! Get it off me! Go away, go away!

22:59.840 --> 23:05.840
Let me at them! Where are they? I'll teach them to spoil my dream!

23:05.840 --> 23:08.840
They're on my face now. Go away, will you?

23:08.840 --> 23:10.840
Show me it, but no, stamp on it!

23:10.840 --> 23:11.840
Stop it, move!

23:11.840 --> 23:13.840
No, it's my foot!

23:29.840 --> 23:31.840
You go fishing again today?

23:31.840 --> 23:32.840
No, I'm not.

23:32.840 --> 23:36.840
Oh, do you need me or is it alright if I go and see those people?

23:36.840 --> 23:37.840
In the lighthouse.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.840
Oh, don't let you want.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.840
Okay, goodbye then.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.840
You mean this room is really haunted?

23:49.840 --> 23:51.840
It certainly is.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.840
But we only saw a pair of feet.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.840
I'll sleep here tonight. Don't worry. I'll protect you.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.840
Are you going to scare it away, Papa?

23:59.840 --> 24:01.840
Mm-hmm.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.840
I can't find any good shells.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.840
You're me.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.840
What about this one?

24:13.840 --> 24:15.840
Oh, yes, that's lovely.

24:17.840 --> 24:20.840
Go on, take it. I don't collect them.

24:23.840 --> 24:24.840
Who are you?

24:24.840 --> 24:26.840
Well, I'm a ghost, sort of.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.840
Are you the rat who walked over us last night?

24:28.840 --> 24:30.840
You were lucky I didn't grab you.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.840
Sorry, it wasn't just me.

24:32.840 --> 24:33.840
There were a few of us.

24:33.840 --> 24:34.840
And walk over each other.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.840
Can I give you a present?

24:36.840 --> 24:38.840
You can't get around me that easily.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.840
You better show yourselves or you'll be sorry.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.840
It's just me.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.840
The others have all left me and gone off with the ship.

24:44.840 --> 24:47.840
Ha, so why didn't you go with them?

24:47.840 --> 24:50.840
Oh, I wanted to, but uh, well...

24:50.840 --> 24:52.840
Come on, out with it.

24:52.840 --> 24:58.840
Never got me and left me all of my own and I was frightened.

24:58.840 --> 25:02.840
Well, I can see why they wouldn't want a drippy thing like you around.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.840
You call yourself a ghost.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.840
No, I'm sorry.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.840
I just can't work out what's wrong with it.

25:10.840 --> 25:13.840
Let's try and see what happens here.

25:13.840 --> 25:18.840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, heavens, oh, my.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.840
Oh, good.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.840
Oh, no, oh, what?

25:30.840 --> 25:32.840
You were right, papa!

25:32.840 --> 25:34.840
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

25:34.840 --> 25:37.840
Quick, open all the windows, I'm choking!

25:37.840 --> 25:43.840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

25:50.840 --> 26:00.840
Mmm, this is great. That soup I've had for ages, Moome and Mama.

26:00.840 --> 26:01.840
Would you like some more?

26:01.840 --> 26:08.840
Oh, he has, please. Can I have the recipe? I could make some for the fisherman. I know he'd love it.

26:08.840 --> 26:11.840
I'll write it out for you. What's his name?

26:11.840 --> 26:17.840
I don't know. He doesn't say. I've come from the north. I left about three months ago.

26:17.840 --> 26:23.840
Although it seems a lot longer, and I'd been rowing south in my small boat, trying to reach Moome and Valley.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.840
Oh, really? We live there.

26:25.840 --> 26:30.840
Do you? You're lucky. It must be very nice. I've never been there, but I've heard that it's beautiful.

26:30.840 --> 26:38.840
Anyway, there was a violent storm in my little boat capsized. He rescued me, and I've stayed with him in his cabin ever since.

26:38.840 --> 26:42.840
And he doesn't talk about himself at all. That's very strange.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.840
No, but I think he does have a big secret.

26:46.840 --> 26:47.840
How do you know, Toft?

26:47.840 --> 26:52.840
Well, sometimes he just stares and stares at the lighthouse in any sort of size.

26:52.840 --> 26:53.840
I wonder why.

26:53.840 --> 26:57.840
I did ask him once, but he glared at me in such a nasty way.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.840
I haven't dared say a word about it since.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.840
You don't want to stay with him then?

27:01.840 --> 27:10.840
Oh, yes. Well, most of the time he's really nice to me, and since I've been here, I've sort of taken care of him, because you see he doesn't really look after himself.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.840
Can I have a cup of tea, please, Mama?

27:14.840 --> 27:17.840
Yes, dear. How is the light coming along?

27:17.840 --> 27:20.840
Oh, not very well. There's still a few more things I could try, though.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.840
Hello. You were on that boat fishing, weren't you?

27:23.840 --> 27:26.840
Yes, I was. My name is Toft, Mum and Papa.

27:26.840 --> 27:32.840
Oh, please, to meet you. Is your friend here as well? I wanted to ask him something. There's something ever quite important.

27:32.840 --> 27:33.840
Ask him what?

27:33.840 --> 27:36.840
Well, about this lighthouse for one thing.

27:36.840 --> 27:39.840
Well, he won't talk about that. He just refuses to.

27:39.840 --> 27:44.840
Oh, dear, does he? The thing is, I'm trying to light this beacon, but having no success.

27:44.840 --> 27:49.840
I wondered whether he might know if there's an easy way of doing it. You never know. I haven't missed something.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.840
It's very quiet.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.840
He might be out fishing, you know.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.840
Come on, let's go.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.840
Where are you going, Moomin?

27:58.840 --> 28:00.840
I want to ask that man some questions.

28:00.840 --> 28:03.840
He doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who does a lot of talking.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.840
Do you think he might know something about the lighthouse keeper?

28:06.840 --> 28:08.840
That's what I want to find out.

28:10.840 --> 28:20.840
Hello, my name is Moomin, and this is my friend Snuffkin.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.840
What's your business here?

28:23.840 --> 28:29.840
I wonder, do you live here? I suppose you must have met the lighthouse keeper, have you?

28:29.840 --> 28:31.840
I didn't want people to talk about that.

28:31.840 --> 28:35.840
We were just curious about why you left the lighthouse. Do you know why?

28:35.840 --> 28:38.840
No, he kept himself to himself.

28:38.840 --> 28:43.840
Oh, so you do know it. When did he leave? Where did he go? You must know.

28:43.840 --> 28:44.840
Get.

28:44.840 --> 28:48.840
Oh, please. Had the light stopped working before he left?

28:48.840 --> 28:52.840
Why did he leave the door open? Were there any shipwrecks?

28:52.840 --> 28:55.840
Oh! Wait a minute. Just one more question, please.

28:55.840 --> 28:59.840
Oh, don't go. There's something very important I need to know.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.840
You're the only other person on the island apart from the go ship.

29:02.840 --> 29:06.840
Oh, please come back. Look, my father is trying to get the lamp working again,

29:06.840 --> 29:10.840
but not getting anywhere. So if you know where the keeper is, or better still,

29:10.840 --> 29:14.840
how to light it when you please help, it's not only for us, but for all those ships

29:14.840 --> 29:18.840
that might be in danger without it.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.840
Moomin.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.840
I don't think that man knows much about anything.

29:25.840 --> 29:29.840
Well, at least he's heard you and knows what you want.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.840
Let's go, Moomin.

29:37.840 --> 29:42.840
Look, over there, what's Moomin Papa doing?

29:42.840 --> 29:46.840
Snork made an a little Maya helping him.

29:46.840 --> 29:48.840
Hiya!

29:48.840 --> 29:50.840
Come on.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.840
Yeah.

29:52.840 --> 29:56.840
It's about time. Where are you two being?

29:56.840 --> 30:00.840
What are you building now? We're making a raft. Why?

30:00.840 --> 30:04.840
Because we wanted to stupid, why else would we build it? Do you like it?

30:04.840 --> 30:06.840
But why do you want a raft?

30:06.840 --> 30:09.840
It's not really a raft, is it Papa?

30:09.840 --> 30:12.840
Let me present our very own hand-built ghost ship.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.840
A ghost ship?

30:14.840 --> 30:18.840
He must be here somewhere.

30:18.840 --> 30:22.840
Well, if he's the one that walked on me last night, I want a word with him.

30:22.840 --> 30:26.840
Yeah, sorry. I'm afraid that was me.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.840
I want a word with him.

30:28.840 --> 30:31.840
Yeah, sorry. I'm afraid that was me and my friends.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.840
Oh, where are you?

30:33.840 --> 30:36.840
Show us a bit of leg at least. I like to see you I'm talking to.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.840
Yes, all right.

30:39.840 --> 30:43.840
Oh, well, at least he looks like a ghost.

30:43.840 --> 30:44.840
Thank you.

30:44.840 --> 30:47.840
Ghosts look pretty silly when the sun's shining if you ask me.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.840
Well, it was your idea.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.840
I always thought ghosts were frightening.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.840
Yes, we forgot our chains last night.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.840
It's very hard to be ghostly without them.

30:55.840 --> 30:57.840
We did our best to scare you, though.

30:57.840 --> 31:00.840
The ghost came to this island because a lighthouse was a bit like an ancient castle.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.840
We feel more at home in castle.

31:02.840 --> 31:05.840
And now when they found us here, they changed their minds and gave up.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.840
That's funny, isn't it?

31:07.840 --> 31:09.840
What's the matter?

31:09.840 --> 31:11.840
You look a bit fed up.

31:11.840 --> 31:14.840
That's because he's been left behind by the other ghosts.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.840
They've gone off in the ghost ship.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.840
Wow, they didn't tell me they were going straight away.

31:19.840 --> 31:22.840
And I'd gone to the lighthouse keepers cabin.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.840
The lighthouse keeper?

31:24.840 --> 31:25.840
Why did you go there?

31:25.840 --> 31:28.840
Well, I wanted to tell him that some strange people.

31:28.840 --> 31:29.840
I'm sorry.

31:29.840 --> 31:33.840
I mean, strangers had moved into the lighthouse and that he'd be better off with us

31:33.840 --> 31:35.840
because ghosts don't damage things.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.840
I didn't know you then, of course.

31:37.840 --> 31:38.840
But some people are very kind.

31:38.840 --> 31:39.840
Where is his cabin?

31:39.840 --> 31:41.840
Is it easy to find?

31:41.840 --> 31:43.840
At the southern end of the island.

31:43.840 --> 31:46.840
But it was a waste of time because he wouldn't talk to me.

31:46.840 --> 31:47.840
I shouldn't have bothered.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.840
And then I would have caught the boat.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.840
Anyway, he's not going back to his job, so that's that.

31:53.840 --> 31:54.840
Bye-bye.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.840
Thanks again for the raft.

31:56.840 --> 31:57.840
Take care.

31:57.840 --> 32:00.840
I hope you catch up with your friends real soon.

32:00.840 --> 32:01.840
Thank you.

32:01.840 --> 32:02.840
You're okay for mortals.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.840
I promise next time we meet Abbey Rally's scurry.

32:05.840 --> 32:06.840
Chains and all.

32:06.840 --> 32:09.840
Lots of chains and we promise to be terrified.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.840
You can come and scare me anytime you want.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.840
Bye-bye.

32:14.840 --> 32:15.840
Relating a try.

32:15.840 --> 32:16.840
Bye-bye.

32:16.840 --> 32:17.840
Bye-bye.

32:17.840 --> 32:21.840
He said anything that could float would do.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.840
But that raft seemed a bit flimsy to me.

32:24.840 --> 32:25.840
I wouldn't like to chance it.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.840
It can be rough out there.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.840
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

32:29.840 --> 32:30.840
Those can't drown.

32:30.840 --> 32:31.840
Can they?

32:31.840 --> 32:32.840
They're dead already.

32:39.840 --> 32:40.840
Mama.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.840
What is it, Mum and Dia?

32:42.840 --> 32:44.840
Papa's gone fishing again.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.840
Well, he enjoys it.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.840
Well, that's all he seems to do these days.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.840
He's not working on the lamp at all.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.840
Well, perhaps living in a new place makes him want to do a new thing.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.840
And he does catch one now and again.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.840
What are you making, little boy?

33:05.840 --> 33:06.840
An elevator.

33:06.840 --> 33:08.840
An elevator?

33:08.840 --> 33:11.840
Yes, and when that's finished, I'm going to build a house.

33:11.840 --> 33:12.840
Oh, my goodness.

33:12.840 --> 33:14.840
A house of my very own.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.840
Mum and Papa doesn't seem his usual happy self,

33:22.840 --> 33:25.840
even though he enjoys his fishing.

33:25.840 --> 33:28.840
He's upset that he couldn't make the lamp work

33:28.840 --> 33:30.840
and isn't used to failure,

33:30.840 --> 33:33.840
but nothing he tries makes any difference.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.840
What a pity it would be to leave the island

33:35.840 --> 33:38.840
without seeing the beautiful beams shining over the water.

33:49.840 --> 33:52.840
What a pity it would be to leave the island.

33:52.840 --> 33:55.840
And when that's finished, I'm going to build a house of my own.

33:55.840 --> 33:58.840
I'll build a house of my own.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.840
And that's all he's got.

34:08.840 --> 34:13.840
Yeah, hey, coming up along, everyone, I've finished my house.

34:13.840 --> 34:14.840
Ah!

34:15.840 --> 34:17.840
Hey, Mum and Papa!

34:17.840 --> 34:19.840
Come here, the fisherman's coming!

34:20.840 --> 34:21.840
Wow, the fisherman!

34:24.840 --> 34:25.840
Yes, and the boy is with them!

34:25.840 --> 34:27.840
He's off to his outside?

34:34.840 --> 34:36.840
You don't want to do it, do you?

34:36.840 --> 34:38.840
No, but I gotta do it.

34:40.840 --> 34:41.840
Right!

34:48.840 --> 34:50.840
Here you are.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.840
So, what can we do for you?

35:04.840 --> 35:05.840
Oh!

35:08.840 --> 35:11.840
Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you!

35:12.840 --> 35:13.840
Hmm?

35:13.840 --> 35:18.840
Tough just told us it's your birthday today, so all the best wishes from us.

35:18.840 --> 35:21.840
My birthday? Is it really?

35:21.840 --> 35:24.840
Excuse me for asking, but how old are you?

35:24.840 --> 35:26.840
I just don't remember.

35:26.840 --> 35:30.840
It doesn't matter. I'm sorry we don't have any presents.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.840
I haven't had coffee for many, many years.

35:37.840 --> 35:40.840
Bring the barrel, woman mama.

35:40.840 --> 35:41.840
Yes, dear.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.840
Now, let me see. I found this...

35:44.840 --> 35:45.840
...sawester.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.840
I wonder if it suits me. What do you think?

35:49.840 --> 35:50.840
Well...

35:50.840 --> 35:53.840
I suppose this must belong to the lighthouse keeper.

35:56.840 --> 35:58.840
Why don't you try it on?

35:58.840 --> 36:01.840
You look good in a sowester. There it suits you.

36:01.840 --> 36:08.840
We'd love to know why you left the island and why you didn't come back here.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.840
And also why you didn't like the land.

36:11.840 --> 36:15.840
We really would like to know if you feel you could tell us.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.840
I was so lonely.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.840
For years and years.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.840
Then I just went away.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.840
I'm afraid that's all.

36:28.840 --> 36:32.840
But you did come back. Surely that must mean something.

36:32.840 --> 36:37.840
I knew I'd lived here for too long. Much too long.

36:37.840 --> 36:40.840
You see, I didn't really fit in anywhere else.

36:46.840 --> 36:51.840
This is the lighthouse keeper's uniform, isn't it? Why don't you put it on again?

36:51.840 --> 36:55.840
And look, it's nice here. I'd like to stay. Would you mind that?

36:55.840 --> 36:57.840
I'll stay if you let me.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.840
Ah, I'd love that.

36:59.840 --> 37:03.840
It'd be fun to see you looking like a lighthouse keeper.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.840
Oh, hooray!

37:25.840 --> 37:29.840
Three days later, the Moomans left the island.

37:29.840 --> 37:37.840
They decided to leave at night with the safe blow of the lighthouse beans guiding their path out and away to Mooman Valley.

37:37.840 --> 37:45.840
Mooman Papa had quite forgotten about his epic novel of the sea, but couldn't wait to start again on his memoirs.

37:46.840 --> 37:50.840
The Moomans

37:51.840 --> 37:58.840
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomans

37:58.840 --> 38:05.840
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomans

38:06.840 --> 38:16.840
They're always happy and always at play. The Moomans are having fun day after day. The Moomans

38:16.840 --> 38:20.840
The Moomans

38:20.840 --> 38:27.840
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomans

38:27.840 --> 38:34.840
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomans

38:35.840 --> 38:45.840
They're always happy and always at play. The Moomans are having fun day after day. The Moomans

38:45.840 --> 38:49.840
The Moomans

38:49.840 --> 38:55.840
The Moomans

39:04.840 --> 39:29.840
Here they are for one and all. The Moomans are about to call. Come on and sit down here with me. They're for you on your TV. They are the Moomans

39:29.840 --> 39:32.840
They are the Moomans

39:32.840 --> 39:35.840
So come with me, give me your hand

39:35.840 --> 39:38.840
I'll take you up to a moment land

39:38.840 --> 39:41.840
You can fly just like a bird

39:41.840 --> 39:46.840
Sing that song ever, there were the Moomans

39:46.840 --> 39:49.840
There were the Moomans

39:49.840 --> 39:52.840
There were the Moomans

39:52.840 --> 39:55.840
There were the Moomans

39:55.840 --> 39:58.840
There were the Moomans

39:58.840 --> 40:01.840
There were the Moomans

40:07.840 --> 40:10.840
Mom

40:13.840 --> 40:15.840
Everything's so boring

40:15.840 --> 40:16.840
Let's do something then

40:16.840 --> 40:22.840
Like what, for instance, I think we've done everything one could possibly do

40:22.840 --> 40:26.840
None of you three can think of a single thing to do. You're useless, aren't you?

40:26.840 --> 40:30.840
Well, can you think of anything except catching grasshoppers?

40:30.840 --> 40:33.840
There must be something we can do

40:33.840 --> 40:40.840
Now we've all had times like this, haven't we? Fortunately, right then, the mailman arrived

40:40.840 --> 40:43.840
Hello, a letter for you

40:43.840 --> 40:47.840
Oh, a letter that must be from my sister for me

40:47.840 --> 40:50.840
Oh no, it's from a woman Papa this time

40:50.840 --> 40:55.840
That's all? Who would write to him? A woman? Someone called Jane?

40:55.840 --> 40:56.840
Huh?

40:56.840 --> 40:58.840
See that he gets it now

40:58.840 --> 41:00.840
Who could this Jane possibly be?

41:00.840 --> 41:03.840
It's your father's old girlfriend, of course

41:03.840 --> 41:04.840
Never

41:04.840 --> 41:06.840
Oh, I'm sure he had dozens and dozens

41:06.840 --> 41:09.840
Moom and Papa was very kind and handsome young man

41:09.840 --> 41:11.840
A voice from the past

41:11.840 --> 41:14.840
Moom and Papa, liquid, I've got for you

41:15.840 --> 41:16.840
Hmm

41:18.840 --> 41:20.840
Oh, no

41:20.840 --> 41:21.840
I was right

41:21.840 --> 41:22.840
Yeah, you were

41:24.840 --> 41:27.840
Moom and Mama, I think you should go back to the kitchen

41:27.840 --> 41:29.840
Whatever, for a little lie

41:29.840 --> 41:32.840
Because Moom and Papa store me youth is catching up with him

41:32.840 --> 41:35.840
Please, Papa, tell us it's not that kind of letter

41:35.840 --> 41:38.840
Oh, what would you do?

41:39.840 --> 41:40.840
Don't worry

41:40.840 --> 41:45.840
Whatever it was, it was a long time ago, long before I ever met you

41:45.840 --> 41:48.840
No, it's not that kind of letter

41:48.840 --> 41:50.840
What sort of letter is it then?

41:50.840 --> 41:53.840
Oh, much worse, it's from Aunt Jane

41:53.840 --> 41:54.840
Who's that?

41:54.840 --> 41:57.840
Mine, my dear, is on my father's side

41:57.840 --> 41:59.840
Oh, how boring

41:59.840 --> 42:02.840
You look very pale suddenly, dear

42:02.840 --> 42:05.840
Yes, because she's coming for a visit tomorrow

42:05.840 --> 42:10.840
Oh, don't worry, there's plenty of time for arranging a welcome party

42:10.840 --> 42:14.840
But I don't like her, and I don't want her to come for a visit

42:14.840 --> 42:16.840
Moom and Papa, why not?

42:16.840 --> 42:18.840
Well, you'll soon see, she's very rich

42:18.840 --> 42:20.840
Very rich

42:20.840 --> 42:24.840
Yes, and she bosses everyone, and we won't have a moment of peace

42:24.840 --> 42:28.840
Oh, maybe she's so rich, she'll give us all wonderful presents

42:28.840 --> 42:33.840
Goodness, this is so unexpected, why is she coming here all of a sudden?

42:33.840 --> 42:38.840
Oh, she says she wants to discuss money matters, good heavens with me

42:38.840 --> 42:41.840
She says there's no one else, so you see, I'm in a very difficult situation

42:41.840 --> 42:44.840
Oh, why can't you tell if you're not an expert?

42:44.840 --> 42:48.840
You don't tell Aunt Jane things, she tells you when that's that

42:48.840 --> 42:50.840
Is that what you explained?

42:50.840 --> 42:52.840
When you meet her, you'll know exactly what I mean

42:52.840 --> 42:55.840
What do I know about money matters?

42:55.840 --> 42:56.840
Nothing

42:56.840 --> 42:58.840
Not surprising since we've never had any

42:58.840 --> 43:02.840
How can she expect a poor creature like you to know anything about money?

43:02.840 --> 43:05.840
Also, she's very, very suspicious

43:05.840 --> 43:08.840
And she says money is a terrible burden

43:08.840 --> 43:11.840
Oh, I wouldn't mind shouldering her burden

43:11.840 --> 43:14.840
Maybe you'll inherit it, and then we could share the money

43:14.840 --> 43:17.840
And have a wonderful time together

43:18.840 --> 43:40.840
This time, I almost did it

43:40.840 --> 44:10.840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

44:10.840 --> 44:39.840
I'm sure she jumped at it. Hmm, there'd be no harm in asking, I guess. What's the matter, Mr.

44:39.840 --> 44:45.840
Hamilton, you look so unhappy. I'm stuck, that's my problem. How's that?

44:46.840 --> 44:56.840
Stuck in my research, this magnifying glass is very good, of course, but I just can't get any further with my botanical research with this old fashioned equipment.

44:57.840 --> 45:06.840
What I really need is a microscope and a laboratory. Hmm, and they're expensive, I guess. Yes, they are, and I don't have any money.

45:06.840 --> 45:13.840
Well, moment Papa's aunt is coming over tomorrow, and I know she's got any amount of money. Any amount, Sniff?

45:14.840 --> 45:24.840
I'll get her to finance you, Hamilton, and we'll get a big greenhouse, and you'll grow orchids and roses and other things, and then we'll sell them, oh, oh, I'll get rich. You too!

45:36.840 --> 46:04.840
Hey, you over there. Hmm, are you talking to me? Of course I am. Who else? I say do you know the way to move in a house young man? Yes, she might say I do. Show me where it is then.

46:05.840 --> 46:13.840
Over there, it's tall and blue, just follow that stream and you can't miss it. Good, would you be kind enough to take my suitcase?

46:14.840 --> 46:19.840
I'm sorry I can't, I'm too busy. I'll reward you handsomely for your efforts, think again young man.

46:20.840 --> 46:24.840
But all I want to do is fish. What? You don't want money?

46:25.840 --> 46:31.840
I heard you were coming to visit moment Papa, you're a Jane, aren't you?

46:31.840 --> 46:37.840
Oh, well, please to meet you, I'm here to take you to moment house. Is this your suitcase?

46:40.840 --> 46:43.840
Wow, this suitcase is very heavy.

46:43.840 --> 46:46.840
Should be, it's full of golden coins.

46:47.840 --> 46:53.840
Oh, I'll take care of this. Let's go and take.

47:02.840 --> 47:09.840
I can't stay in this house, I don't think I can take Aunt Jane. I'm going to hide out in the cave until she's gone.

47:10.840 --> 47:22.840
Bye bye, then dear. Careful now Aunt Jane. The banks have been slippery here and there.

47:29.840 --> 47:33.840
A roundhouse, how stupid, typical of my nephew.

47:33.840 --> 47:36.840
Welcome to moment house Aunt Jane.

47:36.840 --> 47:38.840
Welcome Aunt Jane.

47:38.840 --> 47:41.840
I'd like you to meet us up in a minute.

47:41.840 --> 47:43.840
Please to meet you.

47:45.840 --> 47:47.840
She's very small for a daughter.

47:47.840 --> 47:51.840
Oh little Mai isn't ours, she just lives here.

47:51.840 --> 47:53.840
And I won't get any bigger, either.

47:53.840 --> 47:56.840
Hmm, she's like a member of the family.

47:56.840 --> 48:00.840
And where's my worthless nephew? Why isn't he here?

48:00.840 --> 48:04.840
Oh, well, he's not, is he not at home?

48:05.840 --> 48:08.840
Well, no, when will he be back? I don't know.

48:08.840 --> 48:12.840
He's away looking for inspiration for his work, so he won't be back for a while.

48:12.840 --> 48:15.840
Since when has he worked? I'm here to see him.

48:15.840 --> 48:17.840
Maybe you can see me instead.

48:17.840 --> 48:21.840
What a splendid idea, how clever of you, moment.

48:21.840 --> 48:23.840
Ridiculous, he knows nothing about money.

48:23.840 --> 48:30.840
In that case, it is high time he learned. As for his father, I may still disinherit him.

48:31.840 --> 48:35.840
I'm a member of his family, too. I could talk to you about money matters.

48:35.840 --> 48:36.840
Really?

48:36.840 --> 48:39.840
Oh, sniff is a great friend of mine.

48:39.840 --> 48:41.840
Hmm.

48:41.840 --> 48:45.840
But hardly a member of the family.

48:45.840 --> 48:49.840
Hello, moment. And you must be on Jane.

48:49.840 --> 48:54.840
I brought my brother to snort with me. He wanted to meet you.

48:54.840 --> 48:57.840
This is Aunt Jane, the nice dog.

48:58.840 --> 49:00.840
Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane.

49:00.840 --> 49:05.840
This is my lovely sister, snort maiden, who is Moomin's special friend.

49:05.840 --> 49:08.840
The snorts and the Moomin's may one day be related.

49:08.840 --> 49:11.840
So in a way, we're all really family.

49:11.840 --> 49:14.840
You maybe, but not to me.

49:14.840 --> 49:19.840
I'm an inventor, and due to an accident, I'm looking around for a sponsor.

49:19.840 --> 49:23.840
A golden opportunity for anyone with some loose capital.

49:23.840 --> 49:26.840
Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane.

49:26.840 --> 49:29.840
I'm Hemmielin, a botanist of note.

49:29.840 --> 49:33.840
I heard that you might be willing to fund my scientific research, Aunt Jane.

49:33.840 --> 49:37.840
A golden opportunity for anyone with some spare money, eh?

49:37.840 --> 49:39.840
You'd like me to fund your research?

49:39.840 --> 49:41.840
It was my idea.

49:41.840 --> 49:46.840
If we built a greenhouse and grow rare orchids and roses, we can make a lot of money.

49:46.840 --> 49:48.840
And you'll make a lot of money.

49:48.840 --> 49:50.840
Young man, I have a lot of money already.

49:50.840 --> 49:53.840
Oh, hasn't sniff discussed this with you, Mom?

49:53.840 --> 49:54.840
Yes, sniff.

49:54.840 --> 49:56.840
Well, I was just getting around to it, Hemmielin.

49:56.840 --> 49:57.840
Confusing?

49:57.840 --> 50:01.840
When I am famous for my botanical research, Aunt Jane, I...

50:01.840 --> 50:03.840
I don't know that will ever happen.

50:03.840 --> 50:05.840
This is very confusing indeed for me.

50:05.840 --> 50:08.840
Now, you're snorkemaid and a friend of Moomin, is that right?

50:08.840 --> 50:10.840
Oh, no, I'm the snorric snort maiden's brother.

50:10.840 --> 50:12.840
I'm a friend of Moomin, Aunt Jane.

50:12.840 --> 50:15.840
Did you really explain about my important research, Sniff?

50:15.840 --> 50:18.840
Did you really explain that I'm a member of the family?

50:18.840 --> 50:20.840
Hey, she got it!

50:20.840 --> 50:24.840
So, Aunt Jane would be grateful to all of you and make you a member of the family.

50:24.840 --> 50:26.840
Thank you, Aunt Jane.

50:38.840 --> 50:40.840
Here's your rule, Aunt Jane.

50:40.840 --> 50:44.840
Oh, I do hope you'll be comfortable here.

50:44.840 --> 50:46.840
Just call if you need anything.

50:51.840 --> 50:53.840
Oh...

50:53.840 --> 50:55.840
Come out.

51:00.840 --> 51:02.840
Here's your suitcase.

51:02.840 --> 51:03.840
It was very heavy.

51:03.840 --> 51:04.840
Thank you.

51:07.840 --> 51:09.840
Hemm...

51:09.840 --> 51:10.840
What is it?

51:10.840 --> 51:11.840
You want a reward?

51:11.840 --> 51:13.840
No, no, Aunt Jane.

51:13.840 --> 51:17.840
I mean, yes, I do, but...

51:18.840 --> 51:19.840
Uh...

51:19.840 --> 51:20.840
Which is it?

51:20.840 --> 51:22.840
Will you make up your mind, young man?

51:22.840 --> 51:25.840
I know where Moomin Papa is right now.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.840
He's a whale and a trip, I know.

51:27.840 --> 51:29.840
No, no. He's somewhere quite near.

51:29.840 --> 51:31.840
Quite near here?

51:31.840 --> 51:32.840
Well, where is he?

51:32.840 --> 51:35.840
Moomin Papa said not to tell you where he's hiding.

51:35.840 --> 51:36.840
It's a secret.

51:36.840 --> 51:37.840
A secret?

51:37.840 --> 51:38.840
Yes.

51:38.840 --> 51:41.840
I suppose I could tell you, but he'll be very angry.

51:41.840 --> 51:43.840
Where is he? Tell me now.

51:43.840 --> 51:46.840
Well, if I tell you I'm taking a big risk...

51:46.840 --> 51:47.840
Hmm.

51:47.840 --> 51:48.840
Oh, very well.

51:48.840 --> 51:50.840
How much do you want?

51:50.840 --> 51:52.840
I'll leave that to you.

52:14.840 --> 52:16.840
Thank you for the information.

52:16.840 --> 52:18.840
Now you shall have your reward.

52:18.840 --> 52:20.840
Hold out your hand.

52:20.840 --> 52:23.840
Oh, is that all?

52:23.840 --> 52:27.840
Until I've seen him for myself with my own eyes.

52:27.840 --> 52:28.840
Yes!

52:34.840 --> 52:35.840
Huh?

52:35.840 --> 52:36.840
What?

52:36.840 --> 52:39.840
Oh, there's nobody here.

52:39.840 --> 52:41.840
Where is my worthless nephew?

52:41.840 --> 52:44.840
Hey, this is very strange.

52:44.840 --> 52:47.840
You tricked me, haven't you?

52:47.840 --> 52:50.840
Well, no, I swear I would never do that.

52:50.840 --> 52:53.840
You certainly deserve no reward.

52:53.840 --> 52:54.840
Huh?

52:54.840 --> 52:55.840
But no, wait.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.840
If we just look around, we'll find him.

52:57.840 --> 52:59.840
He's in here somewhere I know it.

52:59.840 --> 53:02.840
Hey, Moomin Papa, I got rid of her.

53:07.840 --> 53:09.840
Moomin, Mama.

53:09.840 --> 53:11.840
Yes, Aunt Jane, what is it?

53:11.840 --> 53:14.840
Tell me where my nephew is hiding.

53:14.840 --> 53:16.840
Well, as I said before...

53:16.840 --> 53:18.840
I want to know the truth.

53:18.840 --> 53:19.840
Dear, he's...

53:19.840 --> 53:21.840
Now let me see...

53:21.840 --> 53:22.840
Come on, hurry up.

53:22.840 --> 53:25.840
He's hiding in the cave down by the beach.

53:25.840 --> 53:29.840
I've just been there, Moomin Mama, and I can't find him.

53:29.840 --> 53:32.840
Then he really must have gone away on a trip.

53:32.840 --> 53:35.840
And why should he want to hide from me anyway?

53:35.840 --> 53:38.840
I think he might be a little bit afraid of you.

53:38.840 --> 53:39.840
Afraid of me?

53:39.840 --> 53:41.840
Afraid of his own aunt?

53:41.840 --> 53:43.840
But why?

53:43.840 --> 53:45.840
Mostly he's afraid of money matters.

53:45.840 --> 53:46.840
Incredible.

53:46.840 --> 53:49.840
Afraid of me because of money matters?

53:49.840 --> 53:52.840
He must be utterly mad.

53:52.840 --> 53:54.840
What a family.

53:54.840 --> 53:56.840
I don't understand.

53:56.840 --> 54:02.840
It seems that only Smith knows anything about money.

54:02.840 --> 54:05.840
I know where Moomin Papa is right now.

54:05.840 --> 54:08.840
So you want some of my gold, who do you young lady?

54:08.840 --> 54:11.840
I couldn't care less about your silly gold.

54:11.840 --> 54:13.840
My silly gold indeed.

54:13.840 --> 54:17.840
With silly gold, I assure you you can do just anything you want.

54:17.840 --> 54:22.840
Seems to me your silly gold doesn't even help you to find Moomin Papa.

54:22.840 --> 54:23.840
Hmm?

54:23.840 --> 54:25.840
I think you should forget about your money.

54:25.840 --> 54:29.840
Young lady, money isn't something you can just forget about.

54:29.840 --> 54:31.840
It needs constant looking after.

54:31.840 --> 54:34.840
That's why I must talk to Moomin Papa at once.

54:34.840 --> 54:37.840
Now take me to that rascal nephew of mine.

54:37.840 --> 54:40.840
If you really know where he is, do you hear me?

54:40.840 --> 54:43.840
Do you have me?

54:43.840 --> 54:44.840
Of course.

54:44.840 --> 54:46.840
Oh wow, frivolous.

54:46.840 --> 54:47.840
Not really.

54:47.840 --> 54:52.840
If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too.

54:52.840 --> 54:55.840
Oh well, Frederick and I were frivolous once.

54:55.840 --> 54:56.840
Really?

54:56.840 --> 54:57.840
Of course.

54:57.840 --> 54:58.840
Oh wow, frivolous.

54:58.840 --> 54:59.840
Not really.

54:59.840 --> 55:02.840
If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too.

55:02.840 --> 55:03.840
I'd be frivolous once.

55:03.840 --> 55:04.840
Really?

55:04.840 --> 55:08.840
If you say so, I suppose I have to believe you.

55:11.840 --> 55:12.840
Huh?

55:12.840 --> 55:13.840
Look.

55:13.840 --> 55:14.840
What?

55:14.840 --> 55:17.840
Little May and Anne Jane walking together.

55:19.840 --> 55:21.840
What are they doing?

55:21.840 --> 55:23.840
Little May is plotting something.

55:23.840 --> 55:24.840
Really?

55:24.840 --> 55:26.840
Moomin?

55:26.840 --> 55:33.840
Sniffs are right, really.

55:33.840 --> 55:38.840
But sometimes he just can't withstand the lure of gold.

55:38.840 --> 55:40.840
Check me.

55:40.840 --> 55:41.840
No.

55:41.840 --> 55:43.840
Well you can't be right.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.840
Let's go back then.

55:45.840 --> 55:49.840
Fine, just take your time.

55:49.840 --> 55:50.840
Hi guys.

55:50.840 --> 55:53.840
Little May, what's the matter?

55:53.840 --> 55:54.840
We have a guest.

55:54.840 --> 55:55.840
A guest?

55:56.840 --> 55:57.840
Hmm.

55:57.840 --> 55:59.840
Move it, Papa.

55:59.840 --> 56:00.840
What?

56:00.840 --> 56:02.840
Move it, Papa.

56:06.840 --> 56:08.840
Oh, so?

56:08.840 --> 56:11.840
This is where you've been hiding.

56:11.840 --> 56:12.840
Oh, what else?

56:12.840 --> 56:13.840
Wait.

56:13.840 --> 56:16.840
Oh, I'm here to shoot you.

56:16.840 --> 56:18.840
I'm here to save your friend.

56:18.840 --> 56:20.840
Wait, Jane.

56:20.840 --> 56:21.840
No, you wait.

56:21.840 --> 56:22.840
What are you worst?

56:23.840 --> 56:25.840
Wait, please.

56:25.840 --> 56:28.840
Moomin, Papa, was sort of on his way back from a trip

56:28.840 --> 56:31.840
and then stopped by to play chess with me.

56:31.840 --> 56:32.840
Yes.

56:32.840 --> 56:33.840
Exactly.

56:33.840 --> 56:34.840
No, yes.

56:34.840 --> 56:36.840
Moomin, Mama told you the truth.

56:36.840 --> 56:39.840
Oh, I sort of stopped by.

56:39.840 --> 56:41.840
Why are you so afraid of me, young man?

56:41.840 --> 56:43.840
Well, I'm not, not really.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.840
I mean, it's not you.

56:45.840 --> 56:46.840
It's your money.

56:46.840 --> 56:47.840
I'm afraid of it.

56:47.840 --> 56:48.840
Really scared.

56:48.840 --> 56:50.840
Scared of my money?

56:50.840 --> 56:53.840
Well, I'm not.

56:53.840 --> 56:56.840
It's perfectly good money and all in gold coins.

56:56.840 --> 56:57.840
Listen, nephew.

56:57.840 --> 56:59.840
I'm depending on you as my only relative.

56:59.840 --> 57:00.840
Yes, yes.

57:00.840 --> 57:01.840
Please depend.

57:01.840 --> 57:03.840
When I get too old to do it,

57:03.840 --> 57:05.840
you must look after my gold for me.

57:05.840 --> 57:06.840
I'm relying on you.

57:06.840 --> 57:08.840
No, that's not possible.

57:08.840 --> 57:11.840
I know, and Jane, we can give it all away.

57:11.840 --> 57:13.840
Must be those who'd love to have it.

57:13.840 --> 57:15.840
Must be those who need it more than we do.

57:15.840 --> 57:17.840
Oh, a green pearl.

57:21.840 --> 57:23.840
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

57:23.840 --> 57:26.840
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

57:26.840 --> 57:29.840
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

57:29.840 --> 57:32.840
She's crazy.

57:32.840 --> 57:34.840
Don't worry.

57:34.840 --> 57:36.840
We'll think of something.

57:36.840 --> 57:39.840
Oh, you would throw my money away without a cut.

57:39.840 --> 57:42.840
Why didn't you mean to hurt you, Aunt Jane?

57:42.840 --> 57:43.840
I know.

57:43.840 --> 57:44.840
Let's put it all in the bank.

57:44.840 --> 57:46.840
Money likes being in the bank.

57:46.840 --> 57:49.840
My money would hate being in a bag.

57:49.840 --> 57:51.840
It could be a terrible idea.

57:51.840 --> 57:52.840
Oh, no.

57:52.840 --> 57:54.840
Banks are so nice nowadays.

57:57.840 --> 57:58.840
They are.

57:58.840 --> 58:01.840
Of course, they have flowers and shiny piggy banks

58:01.840 --> 58:03.840
and pretty paintings on the wall.

58:03.840 --> 58:06.840
Is that really true?

58:06.840 --> 58:07.840
Right.

58:07.840 --> 58:09.840
Come on, everybody.

58:09.840 --> 58:12.840
Let's hurry home and fix a welcoming party for Aunt Jane.

58:12.840 --> 58:13.840
A party?

58:13.840 --> 58:16.840
Yes, any reason is good enough.

58:19.840 --> 58:27.840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

58:27.840 --> 58:30.840
This was Grandma's best cake recipe.

58:30.840 --> 58:32.840
Welcome at Jane.

58:32.840 --> 58:35.840
Let's drink a toast to the only millionaire

58:35.840 --> 58:37.840
in our small circle.

58:37.840 --> 58:40.840
May she live a long and healthy life.

58:40.840 --> 58:41.840
Cheers!

58:41.840 --> 58:42.840
Cheers!

58:42.840 --> 58:43.840
Cheers!

58:43.840 --> 58:52.840
Now, this is your welcoming party at Jane.

58:52.840 --> 58:53.840
What's the matter?

58:53.840 --> 58:55.840
Never in my life of I and my money

58:55.840 --> 58:57.840
felt ourselves as welcome before.

58:57.840 --> 59:00.840
I'm so happy I could cry.

59:00.840 --> 59:02.840
Oh, and once you start crying,

59:02.840 --> 59:04.840
you just want to go on.

59:04.840 --> 59:05.840
Not again.

59:05.840 --> 59:07.840
Please don't be unhappy at Jane.

59:07.840 --> 59:08.840
Don't cry.

59:08.840 --> 59:09.840
Dear.

59:09.840 --> 59:10.840
Oh, dear.

59:10.840 --> 59:12.840
Mom and Papa.

59:12.840 --> 59:14.840
Mom and Papa.

59:14.840 --> 59:15.840
Yes, Aunt Jane.

59:15.840 --> 59:16.840
What is it?

59:16.840 --> 59:18.840
I'll put some of my gold in a bank,

59:18.840 --> 59:21.840
but you must look after the rest when I'm too old.

59:21.840 --> 59:23.840
Oh, hmm.

59:23.840 --> 59:25.840
And why not?

59:25.840 --> 59:26.840
All right.

59:26.840 --> 59:27.840
We'll keep it in the cellar

59:27.840 --> 59:30.840
and make a nice little niche for it with seashells and moss.

59:30.840 --> 59:33.840
And I'll have someone go down and look at it every week.

59:33.840 --> 59:34.840
Don't you worry, Aunt Jane.

59:34.840 --> 59:36.840
Your money will be in safe hands.

59:36.840 --> 59:38.840
Not quite, but I had in mind.

59:38.840 --> 59:39.840
I know.

59:39.840 --> 59:42.840
But I suppose it can't be helped.

59:42.840 --> 59:44.840
It sounds rather nice.

59:44.840 --> 59:46.840
A cozy little niche down in the cellar.

59:46.840 --> 59:48.840
And if you take a look every week,

59:48.840 --> 59:52.840
but oh, dear, it will miss me.

59:52.840 --> 59:53.840
Oh, Aunt Jane.

59:53.840 --> 59:54.840
Very well.

59:54.840 --> 59:56.840
I have made up my mind.

59:56.840 --> 59:58.840
I'm leaving this sink.

59:58.840 --> 59:59.840
It's with you now.

59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.840
So you and my gold can get sturdy used to each other.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:03.840
Do what you want with it.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.840
Your friends seem to have ideas about how to spend it.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.840
Flying ships and botanical research sound rather splendid.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.840
Oh, dear.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.840
I'm so happy for you.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:16.840
Darn.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.840
I should have let us up better than flowers.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.840
So ended the visit of the dreaded Aunt Jane.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:32.840
And I'm sure Sniff will be able to think of some other use for the gold.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:41.840
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:49.840
You're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.840
They're always happy and goes at play.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:57.840
The movements are having fun day after day.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.840
The movements.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.840
The movements.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:10.840
The movements.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.840
Here they are for one and all.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.840
The movements are about to come.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.840
Come on and sit down here with me.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.840
They're here for you on your TV.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.840
They are the movements.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.840
They are the movements.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.840
So come with me, give me your hand.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.840
I'll take you up to a movement land.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.840
You can fly just like a bird.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.840
Sing that song ever!

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:05.840
There were the movements.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.840
There were the movements.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.840
There were the movements.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.840
There were the movements.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.840
There were the movements.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:22.840
There were the movements.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:43.840
One day in Newman Valley, not long before mid-summer on a perfectly ordinary day, Snuffkin suddenly announced that he was going on a short trip.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.840
Where are you going, Snuffkin?

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:51.840
Well, not very far. I'll be back right after mid-summer.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.840
Oh, but Snuffkin, you'll miss the bonfire at the big party.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:58.840
But why in the world are you going away?

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:03.840
There's something I've been dying to do for a long time, and it has to be done on mid-summer eve.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:10.840
I promise to tell you all about it, Moonman, as soon as I'm back in Moonman Valley.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:20.840
Little did Snuffkin know that before he came back, the underwater volcano, which had kept quiet ever since Moonman Papa's youth, would wake up again.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:38.840
What's all that smoke? Is it the volcano and your father's memoirs?

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:45.840
I don't think I like this.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.840
I think it's exciting. In that case, you can have it.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.840
Moonman Mama.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.840
Yes, what is it, dear?

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.840
This hammock is shaking. It's very unpleasant.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.840
I think it's that volcano you told us about.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.840
Yes, I guess it must be.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.840
Mama! Papa!

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:05.840
Oh!

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:08.840
There's smoke rising from the sea, Papa!

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.840
Smoke!

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.840
Oh, that's very odd.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:22.840
What is it, Papa?

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.840
Let me see!

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.840
What's going on?

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.840
I don't know, really. I guess there isn't much we can do.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.840
I can't see.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.840
Where is it?

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.840
Let me see now. It's my turn.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.840
No, I'm at first.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.840
Yes, no, I've got it.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.840
Oh, I'm clean. Let me see.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:49.840
No, I'm at first.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.840
Moonman Papa, will the Earth quakes as big in your youth?

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:55.840
No, they certainly weren't. And this one's underwater.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.840
Oh, my net cause a tide of waves?

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:02.840
A tide of waves, oh my goodness, I've never thought of that.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.840
Hey, what's your turn?

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:07.840
Snatch me the net.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.840
What do you think? Can you see anything unusual, Moonman Papa?

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.840
I've never seen anything like it. This is very unusual.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.840
Oh my, I want to see it too.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.840
How can you bite during a catastrophe?

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.840
Whatever you do, don't rip the top off with you.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.840
You're so stupid, you should have let me have it first.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.840
It's all your fault little my, anyone can see that.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.840
How dare you say it was all my fault.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.840
Oh.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.840
Snork maiden?

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.840
Yes.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.840
I'm standing watch over my flying ship, so why don't you stay over in Moomin House?

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.840
You'd be careful.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.840
You look after her, won't you, Moonman Papa?

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.840
Certainly, Snork. I don't like the look of things.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.840
No, do I. No, do I. We better get inside, Moonman, house quickly.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.840
Yes.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.840
It's scary.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.840
Yeah, the earthquake started.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.840
The earthquake started.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.840
Oh.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.840
What's that noise? Listen, can you hear?

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.840
A noise? What noise?

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.840
I don't know. It sounds like water to me.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.840
Oh no!

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:51.840
What's happened, Moomin House is drifted off to sea.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.840
I don't believe this.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.840
I think Moomin Valley is flooded. It really is.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:07.840
What's happened to the kitchen and dining room?

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.840
Just because I fear.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.840
What are we going to do?

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:14.840
Moomin Mama can't even prepare breakfast down there.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.840
Oh, good morning. You're up early today.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.840
Mama, Moomin House is flooded.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.840
All of Moonman Valley is under water.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.840
Oh, dear. I think you're right, Moomin.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.840
It's Papa's still asleep.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.840
Let's go and wake him up. He definitely wouldn't want missed it.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.840
Boy, I'm sleepy.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.840
I'm even asleep here.

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.840
I didn't sleep a wink because he was snoring.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.840
Little my was snoring so hard the whole bed was shaking.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:42.840
I'm going to have a nap as soon as I've had something to eat.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.840
Hey, snap.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:48.840
What's this? Where am I? What's happened here?

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.840
Moomin House is flooded, sniff.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.840
This means I'll have to swim to get home.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.840
You'll have to dive to get into your house.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:00.840
Unless I'm mistaken, the water is still rising.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:04.840
Moomin Papa, you've got to do something. Do something right away.

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.840
I think you better start taking swimming lessons.

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:10.840
And don't worry, sniff. I'll start organizing.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.840
What do you want to organize, Moomin Mama?

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.840
Well, dear, I guess we should have some breakfast first of all.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.840
Yes.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:19.840
But how do we get into the kitchen, Papa?

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.840
You just leave that to me.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:27.840
There, your kitchen.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.840
I've never seen it from above before.

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.840
Oh, my goodness.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:36.840
People should look at their rooms from above once in a while.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.840
Look, cars of food floating from the cellar.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.840
What luck we have a trap door.

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.840
Mama, shall I dive in and get them?

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:46.840
Yes, please, Moomin.

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:50.840
Be careful, Moomin. It's got to be done.

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:54.840
Hurry up, Moomin. I'm hungry.

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.840
Could you get us some bowls and plates this time?

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:13.840
Sure.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.840
And indeed, the water was still rising.

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.840
It's coming. It's coming. Help!

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.840
The water's up to the third floor.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.840
What are we going to do, Moomin, Papa? Where's Moomin, Papa?

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.840
He's up on the roof, sniff, with the others.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.840
What are they doing up on the roof?

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.840
Ah, there goes another poorly built house.

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:44.840
Why doesn't our house float away, Papa?

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:47.840
It's all very simple, dear son. I've built it myself.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.840
If you hadn't, maybe we wouldn't be about to sink altogether.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.840
Here we are.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.840
Are you coming to help me, everybody?

01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:01.840
This is one of Grandma's best plates, so please be extra careful.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.840
I know. But where do you think we're going, Mama?

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.840
Something will float by. Big enough to take all of us. We just have to wait.

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.840
I'm not going to wait for that. I think this family's out in touch with reality.

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.840
Something big enough will float by indeed, huh?

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.840
I'm going to sink my old skin while I'm still tired.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.840
This is something I should have done immediately, but it's not too late.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.840
Look, there's a whole house drifting by.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.840
Oh, you're right. It's very odd looking house, though.

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:38.840
Yes, it does look funny, but I think we'd better take it.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:42.840
Hmm. That's the one we're getting.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.840
Somebody help me!

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.840
Wait, stop! I'm coming with you!

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:51.840
Don't leave me behind!

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.840
Where's that house?

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.840
Right over there. Just there. Can't you see it, Snapp?

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.840
Oh, that house. What? You call that a house?

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.840
Come on.

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.840
Hurry up, Snapp. What are you doing?

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.840
I just changed my mind. That one looks like it's going to sink.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.840
No, it's fine. We're all aboard. Come on.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.840
I don't believe you. As soon as I'm aboard, it'll sink. I can feel it.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.840
He's scared of his own shadow. Let's leave him. Move any such a whimp.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.840
Come on. It's all right.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:41.840
Now, don't worry about me. You can let go of the ladder. I'm fine.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.840
Stay behind if you like, Snapp. But what about your breakfast?

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:52.840
We have all the food here, and you might get hungry, and if you do, there'll be nothing to eat.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:55.840
Why didn't you say so before?

01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:00.840
Now, hold the ladder, Snapp. I don't want to be abandoned.

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:06.840
No, brother. He's kind of making you know what it is that he actually ever followed.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:11.840
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm falling off your back.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.840
I'm falling. Don't do the same after all.

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:16.840
Don't shake it.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.840
Don't shake it. Hold the steady.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.840
Excuse us. Hello, anybody home.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:28.840
Don't worry. We're not dangerous.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:32.840
You isn't breakfast ready yet. I'm starving to death.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.840
There's no one here, Papa.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.840
I think you're right. It certainly seems empty.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.840
Oh, and the most exciting empty house I've ever seen.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:48.840
Why do you say that? What do you mean exciting? Do you mean interesting or do you mean scary little my?

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.840
Interesting and scary. Look, Snorgmaiden. Look around.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.840
Oh, what a lot of mirrors.

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.840
This house must have been full of women who loved clothes.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.840
Or maybe just one woman Snorgmaiden who had as many faces as there are mirrors in this room.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:07.840
I don't like that. Look, every mirror has a chair in front of it.

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.840
Place just like so.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:12.840
This house was full of ladies and he chatted her a little mirror.

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:23.840
Thank goodness we brought some plates with us.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.840
Woman, woman, woman. Look what I found. Bread and apples.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.840
How nice, sniff. Now we can have a real breakfast.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.840
But where is everybody?

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:38.840
Well, I don't know. Somewhere around.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.840
Whoever lived here must have had a lot of strange hobbies.

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:48.840
You're so right.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.840
Hey, who said that?

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:55.840
Wow, look at that cog wheel. This snork would love that.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:58.840
I wonder what woman will say about this little my?

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:03.840
I'm sure he'll say you look better without anything.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:06.840
One look at you and he won't even notice anything else.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:10.840
Well, if he has any sense, he will fall for me like a ton of bricks.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.840
You want about breakfast, woman, mama?

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.840
We'll have breakfast as soon as we are all here.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.840
I wonder where they can all be.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.840
You know, it's very bad for me to go hungry. I always feel unwell if I don't eat.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.840
All right, sniff. You go ahead. But mind you don't eat all the apples.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.840
Leave some for the others, won't you?

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.840
Oh, don't worry. Of course I will, mom and mama.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.840
This is an apple.

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:45.840
Oh, but where on earth did you find them, sniff?

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.840
In a football.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.840
But normal trick to play on people making false fruit.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.840
I'm very upset.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.840
Oh, this is not bread.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.840
Oh.

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:04.840
Who could have done such a cruel thing to me?

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.840
Somebody with a very art sense of humor, I'd say.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.840
Somebody without anything.

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:13.840
Have some cheese instead. That at least comes from moving valley.

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.840
And it looks delicious.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.840
Whatever these levers for.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:28.840
What's that hear you sound? It's creepy.

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:31.840
Can't you hear it? It sounds like a new earthquake.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.840
Yes, I can hear it.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.840
It's scary and spooky and creepy. All you have to try to be on my mind.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:42.840
Oh, I wonder what it can be. It's very strange indeed.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.840
I just don't think I can take another earthquake right now.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:50.840
Oh, my goodness. Oh, look. What is it, sniff?

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.840
Last moment, mama.

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.840
Why? Our table is gone.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.840
This is a haunted mansion, mom and mama.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:02.840
Well, they can't take grandma's plates just like that.

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.840
You can have the plates back, but I'll keep the cheese.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.840
I like cheese.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:10.840
This is good cheese, dad.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.840
Yes, I certainly did.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.840
Better not let our food out of sight.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.840
Let's get out of this house, please, mom and mama.

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.840
What's this?

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.840
What's happening?

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.840
Oh, we'll have to get out of here.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:27.840
What?

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:28.840
What?

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:29.840
What?

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:30.840
What?

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:31.840
What?

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:32.840
What?

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.840
What?

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.840
What?

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:55.840
Papa, was it the witch who was laughing?

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:56.840
No.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:59.840
The laughter is coming from that ugly one.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.840
Be behind there.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.840
Did I hear someone call me an ugly thing just now?

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.840
Oh, excuse us, madam.

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.840
You must be the owner of this house.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:17.840
No.

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:18.840
Oh?

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.840
Indeed I am not.

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:21.840
Most certainly not.

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:22.840
You are greatly mistaken.

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:25.840
This is no house you fool. This is a theater.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:26.840
A theater?

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:27.840
Yes.

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.840
This is a stage where the heroin receives a standing ovation

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.840
at the end of the last act.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.840
And the bread and the apples are props.

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:37.840
And the rumour you are playing is where the actors make themselves

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.840
up to become totally different people.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.840
Kings are murderers.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.840
Oh, and you are one of these actors?

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.840
An actress.

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.840
You understand less than nothing.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.840
See this brum here?

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.840
This is my only prop.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.840
I sweep the dust in this theater.

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.840
Oh, really?

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:57.840
I have wielded this brum for nearly 20 years.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.840
Would nobody to help me?

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.840
20 years I have cleaned this theater beautifully.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.840
My name is Emma.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:05.840
Emma?

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:07.840
And you?

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.840
You better remember that this is at the theater.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.840
This is no ordinary house.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.840
And it is a great honor for you to be here at all.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:16.840
That's true.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.840
Does this mean that we can stay here just for a while?

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.840
Yes, until the actors return.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.840
Today they all came to a low-verset.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.840
Wow!

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.840
That's really cool.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.840
Yes, it certainly is.

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.840
We'll try not to bother you, Emma.

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.840
Hey you!

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.840
Come on, get in the way!

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.840
Get out, get in the way!

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.840
Get in the way!

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.840
Get in the way!

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.840
You're white.

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:49.840
Woohoo!

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.840
Woohoo!

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.840
Woohoo!

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.840
Woohoo!

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:56.840
Oh!

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.840
Woohoo!

01:19:58.840 --> 01:19:59.840
Woah.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.840
Well, what have you done?

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.540
We seem to have hit a tree, so the house has stopped.

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:08.640
This is a theater not a house!

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:11.040
Oh, it's a Rowan tree.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:15.540
How lovely it looks, how nice to have crashed into such a beautiful tree.

01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:17.140
It's gorgeous!

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:18.740
And that smell.

01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:19.740
You know what?

01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:22.740
I'd like to spend the night in that great idea, Moon.

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:25.240
I'm coming with you, how exciting!

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:29.240
You better stay here, you're bound to fall into the water.

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:31.040
Look who's talking!

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.440
Scary cat!

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:33.740
That looks safe.

01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.540
We could easily spend the night here.

01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:39.640
We better tie the theater to the tree, so it won't drift away.

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:41.640
If that's all right with Emma.

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:45.040
Emma, is it all right to tie the theater to the tree?

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:49.140
Do what you want, as long as you don't damage the theater to get here?

01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:50.140
All right.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.840
Don't whistle, you idiot!

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.040
Don't ever whistle in a theater!

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.240
That's the worst luck possible!

01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:00.340
How dare you!

01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:01.340
Oh!

01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:16.140
This is great snorkemaiden.

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:17.840
We can look at the moon.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:20.140
And the flowers, they smell so good.

01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:24.140
What's the matter?

01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:26.140
I hope that snorke's all right.

01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:27.240
Don't you worry.

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:31.340
He was standing guard over a flying ship after all.

01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:34.340
All you have to do is get on board and fly away.

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.240
What's going on here?

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.240
Huh?

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:05.240
Hmm.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.240
Ah!

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.240
No, they're trying to destroy the pamphor's box.

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.240
I've never seen anything like it!

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:14.240
These people are bunch of vandals!

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.240
Ugh!

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.240
Ugh!

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:44.240
Meanwhile, movement and snorkemaiden are fast asleep, blissfully unaware of what was happening.

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:48.240
But whatever will they do, stranded on the treetop.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:23:00.240
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:08.240
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:12.240
They're always happy and goes at play.

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:15.240
The movements are having fun day after day.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.240
The movements.

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:22.240
The movements.

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:27.240
The movements.

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:54.240
Here they are for one and all.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:57.240
The movements are about to come.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:00.240
Come on and sit down here with me.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.240
They're here for you on your TV.

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:05.240
They are the movements.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:08.240
They are the movements.

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.240
So come with me, give me your hand.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:15.240
I'll take you up to a movement land.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:18.240
You can fly just like a bird.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.240
Sing that song ever.

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.240
There were the movements.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:26.240
There were the movements.

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:29.240
There were the movements.

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:32.240
There were the movements.

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:35.240
There were the movements.

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:39.240
There were the movements.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.240
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:59.240
Women and snorknaten were still fast asleep in the row and tree.

01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:04.240
The sun was high in the sky and the floating theater had floated away a long time ago.

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.240
Oh, I feel so good.

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:10.240
I really slept like a log all night.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:16.240
It's so lovely to be out in the fresh air with moon and a tree in blue.

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:20.240
No! No!

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.240
The house is gone!

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.240
I mean, the theater is gone!

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:28.240
What?

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:31.240
No! The house is gone!

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:34.240
I mean, the theater is gone!

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.240
Moomin!

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.240
Wake up, Moomin! Wake up!

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:40.240
There's been a catastrophe! Wake up!

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:42.240
What's a catastrophe?

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:43.240
Look down!

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:46.240
The theaters floated off during the night.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:49.240
I don't believe it.

01:25:58.240 --> 01:25:59.240
It has!

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.240
It's gone!

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.240
I can't see it anywhere.

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:05.240
It must be far away by now.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.240
Moomin, your father's walking stick!

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:10.240
Huh?

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:15.240
It must have gotten loose in the middle of the night while everybody was asleep.

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:22.240
Crying won't solve the problems don't made him.

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:27.240
But we're stranded in the row and tree with water all around us.

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:30.240
No!

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.240
We're floating away!

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.240
We're drifting away!

01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:58.240
Oh!

01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.240
What are we going to do?

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:04.240
Moomin and Snorkmaiden are still up in that beautiful row and tree.

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.240
That's just typical.

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:07.240
Where is it?

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.240
And how can we have drifted so far away?

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.240
He was the last night, didn't you?

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:15.240
I told you never to do that in a theater and brings bad luck.

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:18.240
Oh, never.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.240
What?

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:23.240
Oh!

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.240
No!

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.240
Stop it!

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.240
Backer to heaven!

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:29.240
Let's go upstairs!

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:30.240
Stop it!

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.240
Oh!

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:32.240
Oh!

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.240
Little Mai!

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.240
Oh, no!

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.240
Oh, no!

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:39.240
That was me!

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:40.240
Oh, dear!

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:42.240
Oh, little Mai!

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:44.240
Oh, get this hurry!

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:46.240
You're so mean!

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:49.240
Little Mai is drifting off!

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:52.240
Scenes were stranded and that's not a bad thing.

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.240
There shouldn't swim about like that.

01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:04.240
I'm too scared to get over to your side!

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:06.240
You must be brave, Snorkmaiden!

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:09.240
I'll catch you so you won't fall, okay?

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:19.240
I told you so, the branch didn't break, did it?

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.240
Thank you for saving me!

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:22.240
Ah!

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:23.240
Ah!

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.240
Ah!

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:25.240
Ah!

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:26.240
Ah!

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.240
Ah!

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:28.240
Ah!

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.240
Are you all right, Newman?

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:32.240
I can stand up, Snorkmaiden!

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.240
Look, the water's only ankle deep!

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.240
Really?

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.240
Ah!

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.240
Ah!

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.240
Ah!

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.240
Ah!

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.240
Ah!

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:43.240
Are you all right, Snorkmaiden?

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.240
Yes, it's so shallow!

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:52.240
I wonder where I'm going to end up.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.240
It doesn't matter, I rather like this boat.

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.240
I'm going to make some noise.

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.240
I'll go back to sleep for a while.

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.240
It's getting dark, isn't it?

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.240
Oh?

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:15.240
Yes, dry land!

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:17.240
Look there!

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:18.240
A fire!

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.240
Must be people over there.

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.240
Yes!

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:39.240
Of course, I've forgotten tonight's mid-summer eve!

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.240
What?

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.240
What a strange catch!

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.240
So the movements have split up.

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:16.240
Are they in trouble, little Mai?

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:19.240
Yeah, seems I was probably the luckiest one as usual.

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.240
Mark!

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:24.240
I'm sorry you can't have anymore, that's all I have.

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:27.240
I don't believe you, your bag's still full.

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:29.240
Yes, but not with food, little Mai.

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:31.240
What's in it then?

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:33.240
You'll soon find out.

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.240
Where are we going?

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.240
To a park.

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:40.240
I hope there's a hot dog stand there.

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:52.240
Those two over there are the park keeper and his wife.

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:54.240
Look, they're always watching.

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:58.240
They guard a lot of poor orphans who come to the park every day.

01:30:58.240 --> 01:30:59.240
Really?

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:00.240
Look over there!

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.240
Unbelievable!

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.240
Hey, what's this?

01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:32.240
Hey kids!

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.240
Come on everybody, we're here to let you out.

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:37.240
Come quickly, hurry!

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.240
What?

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:40.240
We can't go anywhere.

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.240
We have to sit right here so they can see us.

01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:45.240
Yeah, otherwise they might lose one of us.

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:48.240
What a lot of signs, no walking on grass.

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:51.240
No shouting, no running.

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:53.240
What a lot of rules.

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.240
What are they good for, Snuffkin?

01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:56.240
Nothing.

01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:57.240
Nothing at all.

01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:59.240
And that's why we're going to pull them up.

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:01.240
No, you mustn't.

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.240
I don't think one is allowed to do that.

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:05.240
And you have to walk on the grass.

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:06.240
Yes indeed.

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.240
And I really like walking on the grass.

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:09.240
I always have.

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:12.240
No buts.

01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:14.240
Come on everybody, let's make a start.

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:22.240
That looks like fun, I'll pull some too.

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.240
What are you doing?

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.240
Can't you read?

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:30.240
There's a sign saying it's forbidden to pull a charge.

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.240
This one?

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.240
Yeah!

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.240
Oh, oh!

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:34.240
Sorry!

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:35.240
Oh!

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:36.240
Oh!

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.240
Oh!

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:38.240
Oh!

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:40.240
Oh!

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:41.240
Oh!

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:43.240
Oh!

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:44.240
Oh!

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.240
I'm beautiful sign!

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:47.240
Bye bye!

01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:48.240
Bye bye!

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:49.240
Oh!

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.240
Oh!

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:51.240
Oh!

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:53.240
There you free!

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:54.240
Go run!

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.240
Okay!

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.240
Stop!

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.240
Wait!

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.240
Oh!

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:07.240
What an awesome pose!

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:08.240
My goodness!

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:11.240
Those little balls are shining!

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.240
Oh!

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:15.240
Oh!

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:16.240
Oh!

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.240
Oh!

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.240
Oh!

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:19.240
Oh!

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:20.240
Oh!

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.240
Quick, Brian!

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.240
Those were howdy fat receipts!

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.240
Come on everybody, run!

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:29.240
Oh!

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.240
Oh!

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.240
Get out of here!

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:33.240
Someone help!

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:35.240
Someone help!

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:37.240
The rest of me!

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:38.240
Get down!

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:39.240
Get away!

01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:40.240
Quick!

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.240
That's terrible!

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.240
Where could that floating theater have gone?

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:51.240
They're still following us!

01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:57.240
Come on you kids, you can go wherever you want!

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.240
Do what you like!

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:01.240
Yeah, but I don't know what I want!

01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:02.240
Me neither!

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.240
Me!

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.240
I think they want to go with you, Snuffkin!

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:08.240
But I don't know anything about small children!

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:10.240
I'm not sure I even like them!

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.240
All we have to do is find a theater!

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.240
Moonman Mama will know what to do!

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:16.240
In that case, let's go!

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:38.240
A house!

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:39.240
Yes and look!

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.240
All the lights are on!

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:43.240
Maybe they're celebrating with some relief!

01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:45.240
Shall we go there?

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:46.240
Yes!

01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.240
Oh!

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:00.240
Ah!

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:03.240
At last!

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:04.240
Oh!

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.240
Hello!

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:07.240
Happy midsummer!

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:08.240
Thank you!

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:10.240
Happy midsummer!

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:12.240
What can I do for you?

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.240
Would you have seen a theater drifting around somewhere, ma'am?

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:16.240
A theater?

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:20.240
Yes, you see a drifted away in the flood, and my powers are on it!

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:22.240
Oh dear, I haven't seen anything like that!

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.240
Oh, what a pity!

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:26.240
Thank you! We'll look elsewhere!

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:28.240
Have a nice midsummer party!

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:29.240
Party?

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:32.240
Oh yes, a party! Thank you very much!

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:35.240
Very well then, I'll say goodnight!

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:39.240
Did we say something wrong, Momen?

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.240
I don't know.

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:53.240
What's the matter?

01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:55.240
I think she's crying.

01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:57.240
Oh!

01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:58.240
Hello!

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.240
Is there anything we can do, anything at all?

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:02.240
Aren't you having a party, ma'am?

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:06.240
No, unfortunately, she's not coming this year either.

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.240
Oh is she?

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:09.240
My aunt, my father's side.

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:13.240
I invite her every year for a midsummer party, but she never comes.

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:16.240
How sad! You must be very fond of her!

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:19.240
Oh no! She's an awful person!

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:23.240
If that's how you feel about her, why don't you invite someone else?

01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:25.240
She's my only relative!

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.240
So invite someone who isn't a relative?

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:31.240
Yes, why don't you invite us, for instance?

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:33.240
Oh!

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:35.240
Can one really do things like that?

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.240
Just like that?

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:38.240
Of course one can!

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.240
Oh, how marvelous!

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:43.240
To be perfectly honest, we're very hungry!

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:46.240
I've made lots of extra pancakes.

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:48.240
Please come in and join me.

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:50.240
Thank you!

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:55.240
Although we have drifted apart tonight, is midsummer's eve?

01:36:55.240 --> 01:37:00.240
Let's drink a toast to Momen, Snork Maiden, and Little Mai, and hope that they're safe.

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:03.240
You better drink to that no-good niece of mine, I guess.

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:04.240
Who's that, Emma?

01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.240
My only relative.

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:09.240
She lives all alone in a small house by the sea.

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:11.240
Oh, is she all alone for midsummer?

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:14.240
Probably. I always invite me over for pancakes.

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:19.240
I don't like relatives, and I don't like pancakes, and she's boring, so I don't go.

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:24.240
Well, let's toast her anyway, and here's hoping we'll all be together again very soon.

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:26.240
Cheers!

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:28.240
Good health!

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:34.240
Oh, that was really good. Everything was delicious.

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:36.240
I think I've eaten too much.

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:39.240
Oh, please have some more. Oh, this is so nice.

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:41.240
I couldn't eat another thing.

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:44.240
Oh, sad. It's such fun having someone to cook for.

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:47.240
I'm so pleased you're not at my door.

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.240
All that's missing now is a bonfire.

01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:52.240
We always have one on midsummer eve.

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:56.240
What a good idea. Let's have one.

01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.240
Over there.

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:03.240
Help! Help!

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:05.240
Help! Help!

01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:07.240
So glad you came.

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:11.240
See these? The flood brought all of them.

01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:15.240
They were lying all over the place, so I tied them into one big pile.

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:17.240
Would they make a good bonfire?

01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:19.240
Oh, a terrific one.

01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:21.240
Definitely.

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:33.240
Oh, wow!

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:52.240
We've walked for miles, but I can't see signs of a theater anywhere.

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:55.240
Oh, don't worry. We'll find it soon.

01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:58.240
Huh? And what's the matter with you?

01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:00.240
I'm hungry. Me too.

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:01.240
And me.

01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:03.240
I can't walk anymore.

01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:07.240
We don't have any food. If you want food, you'll have to look for it yourself.

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:12.240
Oh, don't cry.

01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:14.240
Look over there, little lion.

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:15.240
What?

01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:17.240
Over there, hidden behind the trees.

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:18.240
Whoa, I have.

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.240
And the lights are on.

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:21.240
We're safe.

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:33.240
Hey, kids, you can't go eating other people's food.

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:37.240
You can if they are home, and it's just what's left over from a party.

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:39.240
In fact, I will have some myself.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.240
It's amazing. I'm always so glad.

01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:42.240
Oh.

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:50.240
Hey, kids, you can't go eating other people's food.

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:54.240
You can if they are home, and it's just what's left over from a party.

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:56.240
In fact, I will have some myself.

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:58.240
It's amazing. I'm always so glad.

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:07.240
Now we must pick nine flowers.

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.240
Why is that Snorke maiden?

01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:12.240
I don't really know. It's always nine or seven of something.

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:14.240
Okay, nine flowers.

01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:19.240
No, not the same kind. You must pick nine different flowers.

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:21.240
And then what do you do?

01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:24.240
You turn around seven times like this.

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:28.240
I get it.

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:46.240
And then you walk backward until you reach a well.

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:50.240
And then when you look down into the well,

01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:54.240
there you'll see the man you're going to marry.

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:56.240
How do you get him up?

01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:59.240
I think I see him. What a clever well.

01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:01.240
That I must try.

01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:17.240
I'd like someone more romantic.

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.240
Got you.

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:20.240
What are you doing?

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:22.240
I'm quietly now.

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:25.240
All we did is pick some unprotected well flowers.

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:27.240
I know what you did.

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:29.240
Hey, Snorke maiden.

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.240
Moon.

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:33.240
Ha, you know each other. That makes it conspiracy.

01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:36.240
But I tell you, we've done nothing wrong, nothing at all.

01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:38.240
We were only celebrating.

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:39.240
Better for you, if you haven't.

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:42.240
But why? Can't you light a bonfire here, sir?

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:46.240
I must warn you that all you say will be used against you.

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:49.240
I have a complaint from the parkkeeper.

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.240
You pulled up these signs from his park and you burnt them.

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.240
That's not true.

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.240
It is true that we burnt them, sir,

01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:57.240
but we didn't take them from any park.

01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:59.240
They were brought here by the flood.

01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:01.240
Older-dash, here's the evidence.

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:02.240
Oh.

01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:05.240
I've caught you when that's that.

01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:14.240
Oh, I caught something.

01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:16.240
Oh, it's just a piece of wood.

01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:18.240
Had any ideas yet?

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.240
Not a single one. How about you, mama?

01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:22.240
Same here, I'm afraid.

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:25.240
I just can't seem to think of anything at all.

01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:35.240
You wouldn't have any ideas about what we should do next.

01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:36.240
Would you, Emma?

01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.240
About what?

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.240
Some ideas about how to let the children know where we are, of course.

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:45.240
How does anyone know where a theater is?

01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:47.240
I don't know.

01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:48.240
Please tell us.

01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.240
Well, you put on a play.

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:51.240
A play?

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:53.240
Yes, that is correct.

01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:54.240
This is a theater.

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:57.240
And when you put on a new play, everybody comes flocking to see it.

01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:00.240
They come to laugh, to cry, to shout, and to applaud.

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:03.240
And when your children hear of it, they will be hearing a flash.

01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:05.240
What a splendid idea, Emma.

01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:08.240
That's exactly what we'll do.

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:11.240
Hmm, I'm sorry. We can't put on a play.

01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:13.240
Why not?

01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:17.240
We have no actors. They are pests, but one can't do without them.

01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.240
I can be one.

01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:21.240
And I'm also quite good at acting.

01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:23.240
I can act very well.

01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:27.240
There are only three of you and not one of you is an experienced professional actor.

01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:30.240
Don't forget, we have you, Emma.

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:31.240
Me?

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:37.240
Well, I've always felt that I would make a rather good Shakespearean heroine.

01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:41.240
And we can each have many parts, as long as they're not all on the stage at the same time.

01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:43.240
He isn't at so moment, Papa.

01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:45.240
Of course, it's possible to do it.

01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:47.240
I want the part that finds the treasure.

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:50.240
No, that's impossible. We have no play.

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:53.240
Nothing simple enough for the likes of you.

01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:56.240
A moment, Papa, can write one. He's very talented.

01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:00.240
No trouble at all, my dear. Any number of acts.

01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:02.240
But we don't want any number. We want three acts.

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:05.240
That's what all proper plays always have, moment, Papa.

01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.240
Let's start right away.

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.240
We gotta print posters.

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.240
And clean the stage.

01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:12.240
Whatever, if I started.

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:14.240
Aw.

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:20.240
And this was how Woman Papa got started on a short career as a playwright.

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:52.240
But while the birds carry news of the play far and wide,

01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:58.240
what has to become of Woman and Snork Maiden?

01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:02.240
Their troubles are real ones.

01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:18.240
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:26.240
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:30.240
They're always happy and goes at play.

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:37.240
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:41.240
The movements.

01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:47.240
The movements.

01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:15.240
Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come.

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:18.240
Come on and sit down here with me.

01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:23.240
They're here for you on your TV. They are the movements.

01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:26.240
They are the movements.

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:30.240
So come with me, give me your hand.

01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:33.240
I'll take you up to a movement land.

01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:38.240
You can fly just like a bird and sing that song ever.

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:41.240
There were the movements.

01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:45.240
There were the movements.

01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:50.240
There were the movements.

01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:53.240
There were the movements.

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:56.240
There were the movements.

01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:57.760
About our brain.

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:06.800
All over Blüven Valley, bits of paper were fluttering down.

01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:11.680
No, we're so weak, are you still going?

01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:15.040
They were even falling over the lake.

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:22.480
What's this? Oh, litter.

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:26.480
There's some writing on that piece of paper. I think it's a message.

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:29.480
Hmm, hmm. Let's see.

01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:33.480
Moomin' theatre presents written by Moomin' Papa.

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.480
Moomin' Papa.

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:37.480
The last children of Moomin' Valley.

01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:42.480
Starring Moomin' Papa, Moomin' Mama, and Sniff and introducing Emma.

01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:46.480
Emma? I'm sure that's my ad. She works in a theatre.

01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:50.480
Admission fee? Anything edible?

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:55.480
They're putting on a play. So they can't be lost.

01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:59.480
Hmm. I haven't seen a play since I was a kid.

01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:05.480
It was wonderful. The best play ever. All about a princess.

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:09.480
She fell asleep in a rose bush. She was so lovely.

01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:14.480
I've got to see that one again. But who will guard my prisoners, I wonder?

01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:19.480
I'm a good idea, officer. You could take the three of us with you to the theatre to see the play.

01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:24.480
Good idea. We love the theatre, so we won't try to run away, officer. I promise.

01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:29.480
Hmm. That's possible. I won't let you out of this jail until you write out.

01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:36.480
It's forbidden to burn signs 5,000 times each. That's the punishment for vandals.

01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:39.480
Well, in that case, you won't be able to see the play.

01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:44.480
Ah, who cares? Oh, whoa. Yes, I must see it. I must go.

01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:47.480
So you'll take us with you? No, you stay right here.

01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:50.480
Well, then you can't go either, officer.

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:52.480
Quiet. You're upsetting me.

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:56.480
No, no. This isn't good enough. It's not true drama.

01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:01.480
Ah, please, woman, papa. I don't want to be just a lion's ugly behind.

01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.480
But, sniff, I did give you another part.

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:05.480
I don't want to be a baby either.

01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:11.480
And she said you wanted parts without lines. Could you do the dusting a bit later, Emma, please?

01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:16.480
His script should be ready now. We have to start practicing for the opening night tomorrow morning.

01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.480
Don't worry, Emma. It's coming along.

01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:23.480
I'm only half done. I shall never get ready in time, woman, mama.

01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:27.480
You're right to worry. For the curtain will rise tomorrow, no matter what.

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:33.480
Women papa will remember to give Emma lots and lots of lines.

01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:36.480
She's really looking forward to her first performance.

01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:40.480
All right. Now, leave me. I must be left alone to concentrate.

01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:43.480
The writer needs peace and quiet.

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:46.480
There are some things I don't like about this script.

01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:50.480
I'll discuss it with you after the performance, sniff, after.

01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:55.480
If it's a story about lost children, why do you have to have a stupid lion?

01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:58.480
I'm too good an actor to be cast as a lion.

01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:02.480
I'll keep them out of my hair when India is giving me a headache.

01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:05.480
You come with me, sniff. We'll practice our parts.

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:09.480
This could be a wonderful play if you'd only skip the lions behind.

01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:12.480
I've heard enough about this behind.

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:17.480
Remember, we have a lion's head, too, dying to show his acting skills on the stage.

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:21.480
This is my play, and I refuse to write out the lion's butt.

01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:24.480
I refuse.

01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:30.480
Here is the key. I want you to keep a keen eye on them until I come back.

01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:32.480
Do you understand me, cousin?

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:34.480
Are they very dangerous?

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:37.480
Yes, they certainly are. They bite if you let them out.

01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:38.480
Okay?

01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:40.480
We certainly wouldn't bite anyone, obviously.

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:44.480
I've had enough of your lies. Don't listen to my dear cousin. They do.

01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:48.480
Well, then, now I'm up to the theater to see the play.

01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:51.480
Take good care of them while I'm gone.

01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:06.480
Excuse me. You seem to be a very good knitter.

01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:09.480
Oh, thank you.

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:12.480
Nobody ever said that to me before. I enjoy it.

01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:14.480
What are you making?

01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:18.480
I'm not sure. I don't really know. Nothing in particular.

01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:22.480
It's just that knitting is so reassuring somehow.

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:25.480
Nothing bad can happen while you knit, can it?

01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:31.480
The trouble is I always seem to forget to decide what to make before I start.

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:35.480
But it feels nice and warm, and I love the color.

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:38.480
Can you make socks? It's a very nice sock color.

01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:40.480
Socks?

01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:43.480
Yes, it's very, very cold in here.

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:47.480
Oh, yes. That's a very good idea.

01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:52.480
Listen, if I knitted each one of you a pair of warm socks,

01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:55.480
would you really put them on? Of course!

01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:58.480
That would be nice. I'm almost freezing to death in here.

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:00.480
It's so very, very cold.

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:02.480
Is it really that cold?

01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:07.480
Yes, my teeth are chattering, so I could hardly talk, honestly.

01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:12.480
Oh, dear, oh dear. What should I do?

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:17.480
Maybe some steaming hot black currant juice would help to warm us up a little.

01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:21.480
Possibly, although it might already be too late.

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:41.480
My cousin would be very angry with me if he knew, but I think...

01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:42.480
But you think what?

01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:46.480
I think I'll let you out so that we can all be nice and warm indoors.

01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:47.480
Really?

01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:50.480
Wait, wait, wait.

01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:53.480
Don't cry now, baby.

01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:57.480
There's a good boy. Don't cry, honey.

01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:59.480
That's enough, baby.

01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:06.480
Whoa!

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:10.480
Oh, woman mama, you need to show much more emotion.

01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:13.480
Try to be more motherly and more loving.

01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:16.480
Listen, dear. This is a very heavy baby.

01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:18.480
How am I doing, woman papa?

01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:22.480
You're just perfect for the part sniffing your performance was excellent.

01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:27.480
Maybe I should add a part with some lines in it.

01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:43.480
Look at these. I think they might be ready by now.

01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:47.480
I hope they're tasty. They don't always come out very well.

01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:50.480
You're so kind. We've had so much already.

01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:52.480
But they smell really delicious.

01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:53.480
They sure do.

01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:56.480
Thank you so much. Now I feel warm again.

01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:58.480
How about some more black currant juice?

01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:00.480
Or maybe one of these freshly baked cookies?

01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:03.480
It's very kind of you, but no thank you.

01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:06.480
I couldn't eat another thing. I'm so full up.

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:08.480
Me too.

01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:11.480
Oh dear, the party is over then.

01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:14.480
I'm afraid so.

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:17.480
It's really sad, but I have to lock you up again.

01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:19.480
But at least I know you're warm in there.

01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:24.480
We're real sorry too, but you don't need to worry because actually we're not going back to jail.

01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:26.480
Oh, aren't you?

01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:30.480
We've got other plans. We're going to the theater. Just see my parents play.

01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:34.480
And I suppose I should say hello to my Aunt Emma, who works there.

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:39.480
Oh, what shall I do? My cousin will be very cross with me.

01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:43.480
But you see, we're innocent. We didn't do anything wrong.

01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:44.480
You didn't?

01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:46.480
I swear it.

01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:49.480
Do I look like someone who pulls up signs in a park?

01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:52.480
We just burned some flocks and left by the flood.

01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:54.480
But your cousin wouldn't believe it.

01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:58.480
He's a conclusions, wrongful arrest. That's all it was.

01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:02.480
Oh dear, why didn't you tell me that it once?

01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:06.480
People shouldn't go to jail when they haven't done anything wrong.

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:08.480
So we can go to the theaters, that okay?

01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:10.480
Of course, better leave right away.

01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:14.480
My cousin will be fairly disappointed, but I guess I can't be helped.

01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:16.480
Wait for me.

01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:23.480
I think I'd better come along and explain to that cousin of mine that his three prisoners are innocent of the charge against them.

01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:30.480
All right, all right, bring it in. That's right, Mom.

01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:32.480
Papa, stop there.

01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:33.480
Okay, sniff.

01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:35.480
Mom and Mama, what have you got there?

01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:40.480
A baby's crib. I want to use this in the play. If that's all right with you.

01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:42.480
Mom and Papa, Mom and Papa.

01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:46.480
I've just read your script and I think you have a big problem.

01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:50.480
Who is going to pay the parts of Mom and Snork Maiden in this play of yours?

01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:55.480
I don't know yet. We don't have any more children and Sniff can't take the part.

01:55:55.480 --> 01:56:02.480
Are you utterly mad? We only have a few hours before the curtain goes up and you don't even have actors for all the part.

01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:03.480
What kind of director is that?

01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:07.480
Maybe one of us could stand behind something and sort of read their lines.

01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:11.480
Wait, thank you, us. I give up. Let's hope the credits are proud.

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:18.480
Hold on tight, all of you.

01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:28.480
Listen kids, you can be as noisy as you like out here but once we're at the dinner you have to be quiet.

01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:30.480
You understand me right?

01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:51.480
The audience is waiting for us. Come.

01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:12.480
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for giving up your valuable time in order to come to our show tonight.

01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:19.480
The world premiere of the lost children. This is a brand new company and the players never been performed before.

01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:23.480
Ladies and gentlemen, sit back and enjoy the superb acting.

01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:26.480
What's that? A baby's cradle. It's for you, Sniff.

01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:27.480
For me?

01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:31.480
We sincerely hope you'll be thrilled by the originality of the plot.

01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:36.480
And so now dear friends, let's get started. Let's get started.

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:44.480
Come on, come on.

01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:53.480
There's a good boy. Don't cry, honey. Please don't cry.

01:57:54.480 --> 01:58:03.480
Oh, moment, snorkemaid and my darling children. You've been lost for a whole month and we haven't heard a word from either of you.

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:05.480
Oh, he's forgotten all about me.

01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:12.480
I'd give the whole world to be rid of this most terrible agonizing despair.

01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:19.480
Oh, make your husband try not to fret so I'm sure he'll be back before very long.

01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:29.480
Little children, come and free me from this plight. Your mother worries all day through the baby's awake all night. Come home, come home my children to.

01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:32.480
With all our hearts, we're missing you.

01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:38.480
Louder, Sniff.

01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:43.480
But what's wrong with you, Sniff?

01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:45.480
This rocket's making me sick.

01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:48.480
Oh, dear, and right in the middle of movement, Papa's play.

01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:54.480
Mama, let us set forth and find our loved one.

01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:56.480
We cannot leave our baby here.

01:58:57.480 --> 01:59:00.480
Oh, anyone would love to have him sweet little thing.

01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:03.480
For how long, pray, do you think we would be gone?

01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:09.480
For as long as it takes, I can no longer stand being this frightfully upset about my children.

01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:10.480
Oh, baby!

01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:14.480
Yeah.

01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:21.480
Hurry up, Sniff.

01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:23.480
I'm trying!

01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:27.480
Hurry, scene two is about to start.

01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:30.480
Help me somebody, I can't get out of here!

01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:32.480
When do they put the princess on?

01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:34.480
We still have very far to go.

01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:36.480
I'm afraid so hurry, movement.

01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:37.480
I am hurrying.

01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:38.480
It's for bitten.

01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:39.480
It's for bitten.

01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:40.480
It's for bitten.

01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:41.480
It's for bitten.

01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:42.480
What are you writing on that, man?

01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:45.480
My cousin won't give up, I'm sure.

01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:47.480
So I better write this 5,000 times.

01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:48.480
It's for bitten.

01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:49.480
It's for bitten.

01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:50.480
It's for bitten.

01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:52.480
It's for bitten.

01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:56.480
A full two weeks has passed.

01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:58.480
Oh, what shall we do?

01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:02.480
Our dear children have disappeared from the face of the earth.

02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:06.480
Oh, what's happened, dear apple of my heart?

02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:09.480
I think I sprained my hands really badly.

02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:10.480
Oh, it hurts.

02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:14.480
If you were in trouble, apart from the wolves, we're all alone.

02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:16.480
I'll put you out.

02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:17.480
Stop!

02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:18.480
Stop!

02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:20.480
Why must this happen in my theater?

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:23.480
I've been squeezed in here to make me look smaller.

02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:24.480
Help!

02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:25.480
I'm trying to.

02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:27.480
We can't have the lion on stage without his behind.

02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:28.480
Wow!

02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:29.480
Whoa!

02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:30.480
Whoa!

02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:31.480
Oh, whoa!

02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:33.480
Whoa!

02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:37.480
We have to face the worst and spend the night right here in the wilderness.

02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:39.480
Dear husband, will it be all right?

02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:43.480
Fairly in these unhellowed woods, I feel quite queasy.

02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:49.480
Sweet wife, I too can smell those frightful beasts howling for a blood.

02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:52.480
May not just smell them, dear.

02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:54.480
Anything that I can hear them now.

02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:00.480
I can hear the howling of those hungry beasts.

02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:06.480
Paint is the roar, but I can make it out a lion.

02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:08.480
Whoa!

02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:09.480
Whoa!

02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:15.480
Oh, sniff, what's up?

02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:17.480
Where are you going, dear?

02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:22.480
Oh, listen, I have to go and stop that stupid lion

02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:26.480
who's roaming around the countryside watching our every move.

02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:29.480
Hey, don't worry, I'll be right back, my dear.

02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:32.480
Was he supposed to say that?

02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:35.480
Hey, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be on stage.

02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:37.480
It's not my father stuck in his crib.

02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:41.480
Moment, mama, stuck on stage. Roll a lion.

02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:46.480
Ooh, that lion sounds very close.

02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:48.480
My husband must be in great danger.

02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:50.480
All right, under that stage, both of you.

02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:58.480
Papa, I can't get this thing off, I feel sick.

02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:03.480
What are you doing, moment, papa?

02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:05.480
You can do it with a cradle on, sniff.

02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:07.480
No, I can't. Stop it, please.

02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:08.480
Don't do it, moment, papa.

02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:10.480
They'll laugh at me out there.

02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:13.480
Don't worry, nobody knows it's you hiding in there.

02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:15.480
Come on now, hurry.

02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:22.480
A lion, a lion is this to be my most untimely end?

02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:32.480
Don't you dare laugh at me.

02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:40.480
Whoa, is that lion gonna eat, moment, mama?

02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:44.480
Oh, no, what might you do?

02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:46.480
What should I do, moment, papa?

02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:48.480
I'm scared, can't be bothered to do.

02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:51.480
Let's run off across the stage, dear.

02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:53.480
We were supposed to run off together.

02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:55.480
Well, the situation has changed.

02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:58.480
I'll have to come to your rescue some other time, dear.

02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:00.480
Oh, help me.

02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:08.480
Help me, please.

02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:10.480
Please, hold out, everyone.

02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:12.480
They got to really see it.

02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:22.480
Help me, please.

02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:25.480
Someone, come quickly before I get killed.

02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:26.480
Oh.

02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:28.480
Coming, moment, mama.

02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:30.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:41.480
Oh, it's only snap.

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:43.480
Little Maya, I'm so glad you're all right.

02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:47.480
Shirley, weren't worried about me, moment, mama.

02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:49.480
Well, just a little, maybe.

02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:52.480
But you're such a lucky girl, I knew you'd manage.

02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:53.480
Mama, mama.

02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:55.480
I don't believe it.

02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:57.480
Mama, it's me, moment.

02:03:57.480 --> 02:03:59.480
It's me, Snorkemaiden.

02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:01.480
Mama, mama.

02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:03.480
Moment, Snorkemaiden.

02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:05.480
Is it really you?

02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:07.480
Come here and let me see you.

02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:11.480
We've come back, mama.

02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:13.480
I was dying to see you.

02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:16.480
Oh, it's wonderful to have you back.

02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:18.480
Isn't that my niece?

02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:19.480
And Emma.

02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:20.480
Oh.

02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:23.480
You look so grown up.

02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:26.480
And Emma, so sorry to have missed your show,

02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:29.480
but I have so much to tell you.

02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:31.480
Hi, everybody.

02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:33.480
That was a great performance.

02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:35.480
Snorkemaiden, I'm so glad to see you.

02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:37.480
Glad you're safe, moment.

02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:38.480
Yay!

02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:40.480
Yay!

02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:41.480
Those are my prisoners.

02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:43.480
They've escaped from jail.

02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:44.480
Catch them.

02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:47.480
No, cousin.

02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:50.480
I let them out because they swear they're innocent.

02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:53.480
They didn't pull up a single one of those signs.

02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:54.480
That's right.

02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:56.480
I was the one who did that deliberately.

02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:58.480
And I helped him.

02:04:58.480 --> 02:04:59.480
Very well.

02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:00.480
You're both under arrest.

02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:02.480
No, no, no!

02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:05.480
We were these dreadful children.

02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:07.480
Dear dear cousin.

02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:11.480
It's forbidden.

02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:13.480
Five thousand times. That's what you wanted.

02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:16.480
And are you sure there are five thousand?

02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:19.480
Oh, yes. Quite sure. I've counted them.

02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:22.480
One, two, three, four.

02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:24.480
Now that we are all together again,

02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:27.480
I would really like to go back to Moomin Valley.

02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:29.480
What shall we do with all these little pests?

02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:30.480
Snuffkin.

02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:31.480
Well, little Mai.

02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:33.480
Someone might like to foster them.

02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:36.480
You can leave them in my car, sir.

02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:38.480
And yours, Emma?

02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:39.480
Yes.

02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:41.480
Now I have some acting experience.

02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:43.480
I think I would like to start an acting school.

02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:45.480
Exactly what this theater needs.

02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:46.480
What a good idea.

02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:48.480
Do you think I would be too old to attend?

02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:50.480
Perhaps character parts.

02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:51.480
Like in my play.

02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:53.480
All is arranged for the best.

02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:54.480
So now we can go home.

02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:57.480
It is Moomin Papa. I think it's high time.

02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:00.480
Quiet, please. I've lost my cup.

02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:03.480
Now I'll have to start again right from the beginning.

02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:06.480
Moomin Papa, do you think we should thank the audience

02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:09.480
for their patience because they're still watching us, you know?

02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:12.480
Oh, you're right.

02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:16.480
Ladies and gentlemen, that's all for tonight.

02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:19.480
I hope you have enjoyed the performance.

02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:23.480
I think it was very kind of you to stay to the very end.

02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:39.480
Sometimes I could almost believe the truth is strange to the fiction of it.

02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:42.480
Well, it is, isn't it, Moomin Papa?

02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:44.480
No, not really.

02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:46.480
We writers are no better.

02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:48.480
Go write more play.

02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:51.480
Oh, what a very good idea, Moomin Papa.

02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:54.480
I think you're as good with plays as you are with memoirs.

02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:55.480
Are you too?

02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:59.480
Right, I'll start on the sequel as soon as we're all back home.

02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:05.480
There it is, I lovely home.

02:07:05.480 --> 02:07:07.480
At least I got a proper wash.

02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:09.480
I've never seen it so clean.

02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:10.480
What about in sign?

02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:12.480
Oh, redecorated, probably.

02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:13.480
Yeah.

02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:14.480
Let's go.

02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:18.480
The Moomin family spent the whole of the following week

02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:20.480
making their house cozy and comfortable.

02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:23.480
And soon each carpet, each cup and saucer

02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:27.480
and every piece of furniture was back in its proper place once again.

02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:48.480
They're always happy and goes at play.

02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:52.480
The Moons are having fun day after day.

02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:55.480
The Moons.

02:07:55.480 --> 02:07:59.480
The Moons.

02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:05.480
The Moons.

02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:20.480
The Moons.

02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:31.480
Here they are for one and all.

02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:34.480
The Moons are about to call.

02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:37.480
Come on and sit down here with me.

02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:39.480
They're here for you on your TV.

02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:42.480
They are the Moons.

02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:45.480
They are the Moons.

02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:48.480
So come with me, give me your hand.

02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:51.480
I'll take you up to a moment land.

02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:54.480
You can fly just like a bird.

02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:56.480
Sing that song ever.

02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:59.480
There were the Moons.

02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:02.480
There were the Moons.

02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:05.480
There were the Moons.

02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:08.480
There were the Moons.

02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:11.480
There were the Moons.

02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:16.480
There were the Moons.

02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:27.480
One night, the moment was having a dream.

02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:31.480
What a wonderful feeling to be flying like this.

02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:33.480
Look over there, Moons.

02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:35.480
What a beautiful lake.

02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:39.480
This is one of the most fantastic experiences I've ever had.

02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:40.480
Me too.

02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:43.480
I never knew birds had such a marvelous life.

02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:47.480
Seeing things from a completely different point of view.

02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:50.480
We're flying pretty high aren't we?

02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:52.480
I'm scared.

02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:54.480
We're much too high.

02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:55.480
Let's go down.

02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:58.480
Please let's go down at once.

02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:02.480
I'm not scared of heights.

02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:06.480
Oh snort, this time you really have succeeded.

02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:10.480
Will I could build hundreds of these if you wanted me to?

02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:13.480
Snort, can I steer just for a little while?

02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:15.480
Now you're here.

02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:17.480
Oh, thank you.

02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:20.480
Do you really know how to steer this thing?

02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:26.480
Hey, stop it, stinky.

02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:29.480
That's dangerous.

02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:39.480
This is okay, really.

02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:41.480
It's just a dream.

02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:03.480
Oh gosh, my head hurts so.

02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:05.480
What a strange dream.

02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:08.480
Did my brother let stinky steer his flying ship?

02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:10.480
Surely not.

02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:14.480
I was talking to the snork while I looked away, suddenly stinky took his place.

02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:17.480
Oh, and then the thing began tilting?

02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:19.480
Hmm, but it was just a dream.

02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:21.480
I don't care, I don't like it.

02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:25.480
You shouldn't have dreams like that just when my brother's flying ship is almost ready.

02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:28.480
Dreams often come true, you know.

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:32.480
But it was nothing like the ship your brother's building, it was totally different.

02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:34.480
But tell me what happened to it in the end.

02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:36.480
Did it fall down?

02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:40.480
I don't know, I lost sight of it when I fell off and I didn't see it again.

02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:43.480
Well, surely you could have turned your head to take a look.

02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:45.480
Well, I didn't.

02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:49.480
Listen, moment, don't say a word to the snork about this.

02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:51.480
He's nervous enough as it is.

02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:52.480
Of course not.

02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:54.480
Why don't we just forget about it?

02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:56.480
Pretend it never happened, eh?

02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:01.480
Oh, snork, it's finally completed.

02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:04.480
Sure it is, but it hasn't been flown yet, of course.

02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:08.480
But it will, I won't snork, you don't think there's anything wrong with it?

02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:10.480
Of course not, but it's just...

02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:12.480
Is there some problem, snork?

02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:14.480
Well, there might be.

02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:15.480
So, what is it?

02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:16.480
Fuel.

02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:17.480
Fuel?

02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:21.480
But you said you had developed a new fuel that was really good.

02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:26.480
It's good, but you see, you see, it might not be powerful enough.

02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:29.480
You mean it might not be able to fly?

02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:32.480
No, it won't. You're quite right.

02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:36.480
Or it will just be an ordinary ship, not a flying ship.

02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:40.480
Oh, that would be nice. What can't go up can't possibly fall down.

02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:46.480
But that's not the point if it won't fly. Everyone will laugh at me. I know they will.

02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:48.480
I won't laugh, I promise.

02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:50.480
Maybe not. Others will.

02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:55.480
But you wouldn't care about that, would you? Who cares what other people think?

02:12:55.480 --> 02:13:00.480
I've already told people that the test flight will be quite soon, in public.

02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:05.480
But I'm sure people will be very nice about it, even if it doesn't get off the ground.

02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:08.480
That's hardly what I want.

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:14.480
Moomin, I'd like to ask you a favor. That's why I sent for you. Will you help me?

02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:17.480
I'll do anything you ask, snork, of course.

02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:21.480
What I would like is for you, Moomin, my friend, to be test pilot for me tomorrow.

02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:24.480
You want me to be a pilot?

02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:55.480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

02:13:55.480 --> 02:14:25.480
Stinky, I'm going to steer that ship, is that perfectly clear? You're not to touch the wheel, I'm the pilot now. What on earth was that about? Wouldn't you find it difficult to steer it? Oh, no, it's real easy, but of course, I'd need to practice before the public demonstration. Is the snorke going to fly his own ship? He'll be there, but he has to stay down in the

02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:55.480
engine room, snuff can. I wonder if this ship will really fly. The only problem is the fuel. Only the fuel you say. That's a big problem. I suppose so. Listen, woman, suppose now the snorke's flying ship really gets off the ground. Well, of course, it's going to, Papa. That something could happen, something could break or you could fall into an air pocket. It's such a dangerous undertaking. Think, woman. Papa!

02:14:55.480 --> 02:15:25.480
Not natural for movements to fly about up in the air. Is it snuffkin? Quite right. What would you and the snorke do if things went wrong? We will be wearing parachutes, you know? Parachutes. You do know what they are, don't you, Papa? Of course I do. They come down from the sky like this, like this. Exactly, but of course, we won't need a parachute, because nothing will go wrong. And I will be the first flying ship pilot ever!

02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:55.480
Oh. Hi there. Hello, my young man. Hello. How do you do? How do you do everybody? Hello, sir. I wonder if you can help me. Do you happen to know where the snorke's factory is? You mean the ship? I must see him. I'm most eager to have a look at his famous flying ship. How do you know about that? It's supposed to be very secret. The information must have leaked out somehow.

02:15:55.480 --> 02:16:25.480
You inventors know about what he is trying to do. He's famous throughout Moomin Valley this snorke. Really? Are you an inventor, too? Indeed I am. One of the more famous. I think maybe the most famous of them all. I am Moomin Papa. How do you do, sir? I'm snuffkin. And my name is Moomin. Please to meet you. A very good day to you, one and all. The muffles, my name.

02:16:25.480 --> 02:16:55.480
He said I'm the muffle. You mean you've never even heard of me the most famous inventor? Oh yes, I'm sure I am. The muffle, isn't it? Yes, it is the muffle. Have you invented anything exciting, muffle, Mr. Muffle? I would be much easier to tell you what I haven't invented, young man. For instance, the pin that can't prick because it has two heads. The newspaper that reads itself the purse that moans and groans if you take money from me.

02:16:55.480 --> 02:17:24.480
The adhesive tape that sticks only to itself. This is perhaps the greatest of all my latest inventions. Whatever is that? This is proper self a man powered fan. Infanible in Moomin weather. All these are my latest inventions.

02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:42.480
You didn't know that, did you? No, it isn't. But try and get a handkerchief, the square balloon, the five wheel car, the hexagonal frying pan, the seven hole button, and a host of others. Indeed, how interesting. What did you want to see the snorkel boat?

02:17:42.480 --> 02:18:01.480
I thought I might be able to help him out with one of my inventions. That's what? Oh, Jill, which one? My new? No, it's very top secret stuff I can tell you. Now, where is the snorke's factory? I'll take you right there. Very kind of you. Come, he'll be so surprised.

02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:23.480
Must be off. See you again. It's a pleasure to help these budding inventors. Snorkel be so excited. A famous inventor, eh? What is your opinion, snorke? Have you ever seen a triangular handkerchief, Moomin Papa? No, when I don't want to either. I do wonder what he's cooked up for the snorke, though. It is sort of intriguing. Yes, indeed.

02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:31.480
Moomin will be able to tell us later, I suppose. Yes, but anything could happen before then. Can we wait that long snorke? You're right.

02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:47.480
No, wait for me. I'm coming with you. Oh, I thought we had several guests. Now, where in the world are they all gone?

02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:55.480
Hm?

02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:07.480
Now, where are they off to, I wonder?

02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:15.480
Oh, look who's coming!

02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:35.480
What are you doing here? We're just interested. Where are the muffle and the snorke? The snorke and the muffle are discussing some top-secret project. It's very harsh. Not a triangular handkerchief, I hope.

02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:47.480
I don't know, Papa. As I said, it's top-secret. Let's see. Oh, bother. The curtains in the way, so I can't see a thing.

02:19:50.480 --> 02:20:01.480
So this is the powerful fuel you've developed, is it, Mr. Muffle? Yes, it is. Not as original as my other inventions, I admit. But very useful. Yes, useful. I call it super fuel.

02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:17.480
Only trouble is my engine has been designed for liquid fuel. No problem at all, young man. If you dissolve this block of fuel in 10 liters of water, your engine will run for at least 10 hours. For 10 whole hours? That's incredible.

02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:31.480
If you doubt the word of the muffle, then try it out and see for yourself right now. Right now? Better still, I guarantee that if used as it is in a solid state, your engine will run not for 10, but for 100 hours.

02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:40.480
100 hours? But that's incredible. You really must be some inventor. Indeed, if what you say is true, it would solve the last problem of my flying ship.

02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:47.480
Oh, now that I've looked more closely at the padlock, this store isn't locked. No, it isn't.

02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:55.480
So if one wanted to see the snorke, one could walk right in. But why would you want to see him, Papa? Well...

02:20:55.480 --> 02:21:02.480
Why don't you tell us? I don't want snorke falling for one of the muffles crazy ideas, that's why.

02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:08.480
Well, we'll find out pretty soon. Maybe you don't realize it, but the snorke is pretty clever, you know.

02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:13.480
I think I know exactly what they're doing in there. Yeah, what?

02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:21.480
I saw that man pouring something into the flying ship. What was it? Well, I guess it must have been fuel, movement.

02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:27.480
Well, how come you saw him? There's a crack that's just about wide enough for me, but I won't tell you where.

02:21:27.480 --> 02:21:32.480
What are those two in there talking about? Oh, yeah, so this is the great super fuel.

02:21:32.480 --> 02:21:36.480
Wait a minute, snorke, there must be something wrong with it. Yeah, you're right.

02:21:36.480 --> 02:21:43.480
What the hell? There you are. Solid fuel indeed, huh? A hundred hours? You're an imposter, sir.

02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:53.480
No, it isn't true, if you just let me explain. No, thank you. I know very well why you came over here with that ridiculous story, off with you right now.

02:21:53.480 --> 02:22:00.480
Listen to me. It is not ridiculous, and it is not just a story. Maybe we shouldn't have dissolved it in the water.

02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:09.480
That was a mistake. Imposter? But I'm the muffler. I don't care. Maybe it's just a misunderstanding, and the fuel isn't suited for flying ships.

02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:16.480
Wrong, it suits everything. Forget the fuel. That was just a trick so he could come here and get to see my flying ship.

02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:21.480
So the muffler has come here to spy, man. Ridiculous. I don't steal.

02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:24.480
Papa, was there anything you wanted to see me about?

02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:31.480
Eh? No, I just dropped by. No cause for excitement. The fuels are done.

02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:36.480
No, it's not. That's not true. I don't invent guns. What would be the point of inventing them?

02:22:36.480 --> 02:22:40.480
Oh, listen to me, please. Let's try and use the fuel once more.

02:22:40.480 --> 02:22:46.480
No, thanks. Once was once too many. I'll have to clean my tanks from your gunge. Get out of my sight.

02:22:51.480 --> 02:23:01.480
Oh dear, this must have been a bit of a disappointment for the snork. I know.

02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:14.480
Now listen, stinky. I'm doing this for the snorksake, isn't that so?

02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:19.480
I don't care if you're doing it for all I want is to get a good look at the famous flying ship.

02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:26.480
You'd need something very powerful to get a thing like that off the ground. Something so powerful that only I, the muffler, could ever have invented it.

02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:30.480
Remind me one day to show you my famous triangular handkerchief.

02:23:30.480 --> 02:23:35.480
Now all we have to do is not dissolve the fuel in water but use the solid fuel.

02:23:35.480 --> 02:23:39.480
Hurry up with that lock, stinky, or maybe I should invent a lock pick.

02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:43.480
Come on, stinky. Hurry, hurry.

02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:45.480
There you are done.

02:23:45.480 --> 02:23:47.480
Good, come. We don't have much time.

02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:58.480
No, I'm dying to steer this ship.

02:23:58.480 --> 02:24:03.480
Oh, stinky, stinky. We're flying at a height of just over 2,000 meters now.

02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:05.480
Stinky! Yeah, I'm listening. What is it?

02:24:05.480 --> 02:24:10.480
When you hear me say now, that's when I want you to start off the engine immediately.

02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:13.480
All right, no problem. I guess it must be this one.

02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:15.480
No, no, not yet. This is it.

02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:20.480
Just a drop of water on the fuel block. Now that should do it.

02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:25.480
Can I start it now? Not yet. All right.

02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:34.480
Now, start off the engine stinky. Die, answer.

02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:38.480
Did you really turn on the switch? Yes, I did.

02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:42.480
The engine won't start. Are you quite sure you turned the one I pointed out to you?

02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:46.480
I think so. Maybe I turned the wrong one.

02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:48.480
Outside these two is where I'll come on.

02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:53.480
Stinky, this is no joke. My reputation as a famous inventor is at stake.

02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:56.480
These two do it, I think. Is that work, Mr. Mapple?

02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:01.480
Nothing is happening. I knew I shouldn't have let you do it better to do it myself.

02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:03.480
You're useless. Wait, Mr. Mapple.

02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:06.480
I haven't tried the very last one in the row. This one switched late.

02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:11.480
What? I better throw that one too. You never know. It might just do the trick.

02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:23.480
It works. It works. I know it works. I know it works.

02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:25.480
It is working.

02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:31.480
I'm not surprised, but I'm so pleased with myself.

02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:37.480
You should be here, Snork. This is my great moment. You should be here to share it with me.

02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:41.480
Come on, I can't wait to try this thing.

02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:48.480
Incredible. This ship's arrived.

02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:51.480
This is one of my desert inventions.

02:25:51.480 --> 02:25:54.480
Ha, ha, ha!

02:25:57.480 --> 02:26:01.480
Pass! Pass! Pass!

02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:03.480
Pass!

02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:10.480
Pass! Pass!

02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:13.480
Pass!

02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:25.480
Come on, let me go! Come on!

02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:32.480
What's your power? I don't think the engine has started up.

02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:36.480
I'm very much afraid it's exploding.

02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:39.480
Hey, stinky engines exploding.

02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:41.480
Where are you going?

02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:45.480
It's going to explode any minute by wonderful invention.

02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:46.480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:45.480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh electrodes. Now, come to your nice room on the small side, but the very best one. That explosion, it really was most unexpected, officer. Everybody knows you're a great inventor. I wonder if you could help me, Mr. muffel. Look how? Could you think of something to protect my roses while you're staying with us? An-an explosive, of course.

02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:46.480
Of course I couldn't.

02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:48.480
Piece of cake, officer.

02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:52.480
Oh, I really did want to fly.

02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:57.480
Come, come now, cheer up, snorke dear.

02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:00.480
Here you are, a nice cup of tea.

02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:01.480
Thanks.

02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:08.480
It's very strange, but I had a dream the other night about a flying ship.

02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:11.480
Did you really move in? That sounds very interesting.

02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:13.480
Yes, very interesting.

02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:15.480
Moment, tell me about it.

02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:21.480
Yes, it was a peculiar looking ship totally different from your flying ship, snorke.

02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:23.480
Different? Oh.

02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:27.480
Well, it was sort of round like this.

02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:31.480
It had a propeller and something hanging underneath.

02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:34.480
And we flew over a high mountain.

02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:36.480
Round?

02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:37.480
Yes.

02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:40.480
And you were in a sort of thing hanging underneath.

02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:41.480
Yes.

02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:43.480
Round?

02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:45.480
Round, huh?

02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:47.480
Round?

02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:51.480
What ever is the matter, snorke?

02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:52.480
What?

02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:54.480
Oh, mama, thanks for the tea.

02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:56.480
I think I'm getting a new idea.

02:28:56.480 --> 02:28:58.480
Moment, see you later.

02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:00.480
Papa, I must go.

02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:02.480
Oh, there he goes again.

02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:04.480
I know that, look, mama.

02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:08.480
You won't get an intelligent answer out of him for the next month or so, honestly.

02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:10.480
I'm very happy for him.

02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:14.480
I must say that was a very clever dream you had, moment.

02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:16.480
I'm a better inventor than the model.

02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:20.480
You deserve a triangular acruchy.

02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:25.480
So the explosion didn't distress the snort for long.

02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:29.480
Soon he was back at his favorite occupation, planning.

02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:31.480
But planning what?

02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:33.480
Rome?

02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:41.480
Rome?

02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:45.480
Yes.

02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:48.480
Rome?

02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:55.480
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

02:29:55.480 --> 02:30:03.480
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:06.480
They're always happy and go as it played.

02:30:06.480 --> 02:30:10.480
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:30:10.480 --> 02:30:13.480
The movements.

02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:17.480
The movements.

02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:23.480
The movements.

02:30:33.480 --> 02:30:50.480
Here they are for one and all.

02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:53.480
The movements are about to come.

02:30:53.480 --> 02:30:56.480
Come on and sit down here with me.

02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:58.480
They're for you on your TV.

02:30:58.480 --> 02:31:01.480
They are the movements.

02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:04.480
They are the movements.

02:31:04.480 --> 02:31:07.480
So come with me, give me your hand.

02:31:07.480 --> 02:31:10.480
I'll take you up to a moment land.

02:31:10.480 --> 02:31:13.480
You can fly just like a bird.

02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:15.480
Sing that song ever.

02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:18.480
There were the movements.

02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:21.480
There were the movements.

02:31:21.480 --> 02:31:24.480
There were the movements.

02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:27.480
There were the movements.

02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:30.480
There were the movements.

02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:35.480
There were the movements.

02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:40.480
There were the movements.

02:31:40.480 --> 02:31:43.480
There were the movements.

02:31:43.480 --> 02:31:51.480
There were the movements.

02:31:51.480 --> 02:31:54.480
When the Henry first told movement about the golden fish,

02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:59.480
the woman thought to himself that it must look something like that.

02:31:59.480 --> 02:32:08.480
My grandpa told me that his mother had actually seen it.

02:32:08.480 --> 02:32:10.480
So you never saw it yourself, Mr. Hamlin?

02:32:10.480 --> 02:32:12.480
No, I'm a botanist.

02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:16.480
It comes to the surface only under very special conditions.

02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:18.480
It's very rarely seen.

02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:19.480
Conditions?

02:32:19.480 --> 02:32:20.480
Yes.

02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:23.480
First of all, it must be right between summer and autumn.

02:32:23.480 --> 02:32:25.480
But that's now.

02:32:26.480 --> 02:32:29.480
It has to be in the afternoon sunshine after heavy rain.

02:32:29.480 --> 02:32:31.480
Yes, that does narrow it down.

02:32:31.480 --> 02:32:33.480
And there must be no wind.

02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:36.480
Grandpa said not even a ripple on the water.

02:32:36.480 --> 02:32:37.480
Oh dear.

02:32:37.480 --> 02:32:42.480
And there are some other conditions that he really didn't know about anyway to see it.

02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:44.480
You must be extremely lucky.

02:32:46.480 --> 02:32:49.480
Hmm, just getting to the lake itself isn't too easy.

02:32:49.480 --> 02:32:52.480
It's way beyond lonely mountains.

02:32:53.480 --> 02:32:58.480
Going over lonely mountains and back would take at least two days.

02:32:58.480 --> 02:33:01.480
Not really, because I know a shortcut movement.

02:33:01.480 --> 02:33:03.480
I could take you there and back in one day.

02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:05.480
Oh, could you do that?

02:33:05.480 --> 02:33:06.480
Yes.

02:33:06.480 --> 02:33:08.480
Have you already been there, Snuffkin?

02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:10.480
Just once.

02:33:10.480 --> 02:33:12.480
Oh, will you show me the way?

02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:13.480
You really want to go?

02:33:13.480 --> 02:33:14.480
Yes.

02:33:14.480 --> 02:33:18.480
I must see that golden fish with my own eyes and maybe capture it.

02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:20.480
It won't be easy to capture.

02:33:21.480 --> 02:33:22.480
Why not?

02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:25.480
From what I've heard, the golden fish is far too clever to get caught.

02:33:25.480 --> 02:33:28.480
I know, but it would be so much fun.

02:33:28.480 --> 02:33:29.480
You going alone?

02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:32.480
Well, Snorkmaiden said she wanted to come along.

02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:34.480
She gets these ideas, you know.

02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:35.480
Just Snorkmaiden?

02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:36.480
Uh, maybe little Mai.

02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:37.480
What about Sniff?

02:33:37.480 --> 02:33:40.480
I think he wants to come along too.

02:33:40.480 --> 02:33:41.480
What would you?

02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:45.480
In that case, we'd better go across the mountains.

02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:46.480
Why is that?

02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:47.480
Why can't we take the shortcut?

02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:51.480
The path is rather steep and dangerous, you know, Moomin.

02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:53.480
Especially in the forest of witches.

02:33:53.480 --> 02:33:54.480
Hi, the witches?

02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:55.480
Not now, maybe.

02:33:55.480 --> 02:33:57.480
Oh, so it's safe then.

02:33:57.480 --> 02:34:01.480
But it's a very deep forest dark and scary even in daytime.

02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:06.480
That's okay. We'll take the shortcut.

02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:19.480
Oh, dear.

02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:38.480
So long.

02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:48.480
Good morning, Snuffkin!

02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:03.480
Sorry, Snuffkin. Guess I overslept.

02:35:03.480 --> 02:35:06.480
Snortmaiden, a little my auntie, yet.

02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:08.480
You're very early.

02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:12.480
I dreamt I caught the golden fish, and then, of course, I couldn't go back to sleep.

02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:14.480
Well, let's go.

02:35:14.480 --> 02:35:16.480
Shouldn't we wait for Snortmaiden and little my?

02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:19.480
Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?

02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:23.480
And anyway, didn't we decide that we wouldn't wait for anybody?

02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:25.480
So it might be better this way.

02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:27.480
What's better this way, woman?

02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:29.480
Oh, little my!

02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:31.480
Why don't you stay here?

02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:33.480
This will be a very tough expedition.

02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:35.480
I'm tougher than you.

02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:37.480
Wait for me!

02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:45.480
Hey, walk any faster, Snuffkin.

02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:47.480
I'm still so sleepy.

02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:51.480
Why did we have to leave so early, moving?

02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:53.480
To get there, back in a day, Snortmaiden.

02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:55.480
But we aren't taking the shortcut, are we?

02:35:55.480 --> 02:35:58.480
Yes, but it still might get dark before we're back.

02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:01.480
I won't be able to walk back this fast, you know,

02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:04.480
because my bucket will be full of water for the golden fish.

02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:07.480
Well, don't be disappointed if you don't catch it.

02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:09.480
But that's my whole reason for going!

02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:11.480
But you heard what the Himmelin said, Snuff?

02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:15.480
We'll be extremely lucky to even catch sight of the golden fish.

02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:17.480
I heard him, and now's exactly the right time.

02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:20.480
Maybe the others made too much noise.

02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:22.480
We'll just have to wait and see.

02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:25.480
Don't you worry, I'll catch him all right.

02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:36.480
Where are they?

02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:38.480
We're going sorely in the morning.

02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:43.480
How far is the forest of witches?

02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:45.480
I'd say about two hours.

02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:50.480
And can you also tell us how long from one end of the forest to the other, Snuffkin?

02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:52.480
About the same.

02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:57.480
Are there really such things as witches?

02:36:57.480 --> 02:36:58.480
No.

02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:00.480
Baby, because I'm not a bit scared of them.

02:37:00.480 --> 02:37:01.480
Aren't you?

02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:03.480
Not the least little bit.

02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:04.480
There used to be some, though.

02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:05.480
What, witches?

02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:06.480
Well, of course, Snuff.

02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:09.480
What else do you think that they call it the forest of witches, huh?

02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:13.480
And you're absolutely sure that there are no witches now.

02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:15.480
I haven't heard of any coming back.

02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:20.480
So you're not absolutely sure that there are no witches.

02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:29.480
Where's Moomeyerner still in bed?

02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:32.480
He was off before you woke up, Papa.

02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:36.480
Oh, the golden fish.

02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:38.480
Good morning, dear.

02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:40.480
I wanted to go with them.

02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:43.480
But you're writing your memoirs you're far too busy.

02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:47.480
And that's very true with the sort of a fish that no one has seen.

02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:50.480
That might have been a whole chapter.

02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:52.480
Do you think they'll catch it?

02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:55.480
No, I doubt it very much. It's highly unlikely.

02:37:55.480 --> 02:37:57.480
In that case, you should have gone with them.

02:37:57.480 --> 02:38:00.480
No, I do know a thing or two bad fishing.

02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:03.480
Snuffkin does, too, but he's still so young.

02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:06.480
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure Snuffkin will manage.

02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:10.480
Oh, this is a spooky forest.

02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:12.480
Maybe the witch is every time.

02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:14.480
Stop it, little mind.

02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:16.480
Listen, everybody. Don't stray away from me.

02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:18.480
Promise you might get lost.

02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:32.480
Oh, it's so dark in here.

02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:36.480
Sure, isn't so thick the sun can't get through.

02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:40.480
That's because of those clouds.

02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:02.480
I can hear the wind.

02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:04.480
But we need calm.

02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:06.480
Yeah, but we also need heavy rain.

02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:08.480
You're right, that's what the Hemiellin said.

02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:10.480
It sure looks like rain.

02:39:10.480 --> 02:39:12.480
Not only looks like...

02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:16.480
Oh, it's raining.

02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:32.480
Here.

02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:34.480
Oh, thank you.

02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:40.480
I gotta say this rainstorm was very sudden.

02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:42.480
Don't worry, it won't last that long.

02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:44.480
How do you know that?

02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:46.480
Vagabons do.

02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:48.480
This rain isn't that heavy.

02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:50.480
No, it's not bad, but we better hurryer.

02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:54.480
We won't get to the lake till noon, and that'll be too late.

02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:57.480
I don't think we'll get very wet down here, Mum.

02:39:57.480 --> 02:39:59.480
And so why don't we move on?

02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:01.480
I'm excited.

02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:03.480
What should we do, it's nothing.

02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:05.480
Well, we could move on, couldn't we?

02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:07.480
Yeah.

02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:15.480
Yeah!

02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:25.480
We really are getting too wet.

02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:27.480
We better find some shelter quickly.

02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:29.480
But where can we shelter?

02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:31.480
There's nothing in this wood-except tree.

02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:33.480
On your tree, then, I guess.

02:40:33.480 --> 02:40:35.480
Yeah!

02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:37.480
What is it, Snorke, Nathan?

02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:39.480
There's a house over there.

02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:47.480
It's falling to wreck and ruin.

02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:49.480
Well, at least it'll keep the rain off.

02:40:57.480 --> 02:40:59.480
Yeah!

02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:09.480
Hello there!

02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:11.480
Anyone home?

02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:13.480
There's nobody here.

02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:26.480
No one's lived here for a long time.

02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:30.480
I wonder who could have been who lived here all alone.

02:41:40.480 --> 02:41:42.480
I know who it was.

02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:44.480
And so do we all.

02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:46.480
Surely you don't mean.

02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:48.480
The Witches, of course.

02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:54.480
Look around for dried spices, magic herbs, brums, sticks, and a black cat.

02:41:54.480 --> 02:41:56.480
A niren pot.

02:41:56.480 --> 02:41:58.480
A pile.

02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:00.480
But no, bro.

02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:02.480
No, the Witch rode away on it.

02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:08.480
There's someone here.

02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:10.480
Who is it?

02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:18.480
Let's get out of here.

02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:20.480
Came from over there.

02:42:24.480 --> 02:42:26.480
No, don't.

02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:28.480
That's okay, Snorke.

02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:30.480
We gotta get out of this place.

02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:42.480
Oh, I can't move, Snorke, Nathan.

02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:44.480
Stinky?

02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:50.480
Pretty good.

02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:52.480
I bet you were really scared.

02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:56.480
It's very rude of sniff to faint when he hears my voice.

02:42:56.480 --> 02:43:00.480
Where are you off to anyway?

02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:02.480
Oh, come on, tell me.

02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:04.480
Can't you even take a joke?

02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:06.480
Come on, wait for me.

02:43:06.480 --> 02:43:08.480
Okay.

02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:22.480
That way.

02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:24.480
Okay.

02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:26.480
Come on.

02:43:36.480 --> 02:44:04.200
This is it isn't it yes it is where's the golden fish I really don't know I've never seen it either

02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:12.640
with rain sunshine and calm I'm sure all the fish will come the golden fish help me catch it I just got to have that golden fish

02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:42.040
oh it's deep down in here somewhere I can't see any fish anywhere

02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:55.120
maybe it was a very funny joke the hamula doesn't show let's sit down and wait I'm sure the golden fish will appear for us I don't believe it do me

02:44:55.120 --> 02:45:02.040
to say you came all this way here just to see some stupid old fish I came to catch it well that's even more stupid

02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:15.600
they stopped making those ripples so they really got excited and walked all the way you say oh to be young again well I would have gone

02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:22.680
with them if I hadn't over slept I didn't know that you were that young woman Papa I'm not exactly old you know

02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:29.880
pretty interesting to see a fish that hardly anyone's ever seen sniff said that he would catch this

02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:37.200
golden fish if it's the last thing he did oh well he had a net and a very large bucket to carry at home

02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:46.800
and that's a good one what do you mean I guess I must have forgotten to tell you all the details there's

02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:57.000
so much you don't know about this fish

02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:06.000
the hamula was certainly right hardly anyone has seen this golden fish and we're not gonna see it either

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:15.360
maybe somebody ate him years ago stinky be quiet please did you see it where did you see it

02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:25.240
huh I saw a fish jump but I couldn't tell if it was golden it was much too far away with the sun over

02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:32.120
there we just see the outlines norc maiden yes we couldn't really see the color look everybody look I can see

02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:40.520
your raft over there hey let's take it and go on to the middle of the lake but it's much too small for all of us

02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:50.600
don't worry sniff this won't sink I'm staying you do what you like but you'll never catch any fish if

02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:58.880
you're afraid of water stinky you can help me it's gold you know we can sell it for a lot of money

02:46:58.880 --> 02:47:16.320
and then we'll both be very wealthy I think it was somewhere around here wasn't it or unless I

02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:25.960
suppose hard to say well I can't see anything I did see there's certainly no sign of it now well we'll

02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:34.200
just have to sit and wait here we've no choice I'm not going home until I've seen it I'm happy to wait

02:47:34.200 --> 02:47:40.920
all day you won't find it by looking up at the sky you know what fish like it in places where there

02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:47.800
are lots of wings oh the rafts in the middle of the lake and they just want to see the fish but you

02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:53.640
wait I'm going to catch it maybe somebody's already caught it and you can get it in the tin

02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:06.040
over there something shiny jumping see I told you now keep quiet

02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:27.000
I hate fishing guess we better think about getting back otherwise we'll never get home before nightfall

02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:33.160
I don't want to get lost on a raft in the dark on this lonely lake perhaps we were expecting too much

02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:40.360
maybe your right snort maiden but I really thought we'd see it this is the most disappointing day of my

02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:43.720
life we can come back yes

02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:50.120
oh

02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:58.120
it's not going to stop

02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:05.080
now did you see a moment

02:49:18.360 --> 02:49:24.520
oh

02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:30.920
it's gigantic

02:49:47.800 --> 02:50:17.800
I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't

02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:47.800
know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do,

02:50:47.800 --> 02:50:49.800
I did it! I caught it!

02:50:49.800 --> 02:50:50.800
Pardon what?

02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:52.800
Why the golden fish, of course?

02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:53.800
What?

02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:56.800
I've got the golden fish in here if you want to have a look at it.

02:50:56.800 --> 02:50:58.800
See? It's in this bucket.

02:50:58.800 --> 02:51:00.800
Huh?

02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:03.800
You don't really believe that is the golden fish.

02:51:03.800 --> 02:51:05.800
Huh? Huh?

02:51:05.800 --> 02:51:08.800
It's just another stupid fish.

02:51:08.800 --> 02:51:11.800
I can swear that it really was golden when I caught it.

02:51:11.800 --> 02:51:15.800
It must have been the sun making it land in the water.

02:51:15.800 --> 02:51:17.800
It was you said it was the golden fish.

02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:19.800
Why don't you let it go?

02:51:19.800 --> 02:51:22.800
You know it's not the right one and he hates it in that bucket.

02:51:22.800 --> 02:51:24.800
Huh?

02:51:29.800 --> 02:51:32.800
There he goes. It looks so happy now.

02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:35.800
It really was gold when I first saw it.

02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:37.800
We believe you sniff.

02:51:37.800 --> 02:51:39.800
Now let's go home.

02:51:45.800 --> 02:51:53.800
Steph and Stinky never really got home together.

02:51:53.800 --> 02:51:57.800
They believed it was actually the golden fish they had caught.

02:51:57.800 --> 02:52:01.800
But moving in the others were in no doubt about what they had seen.

02:52:01.800 --> 02:52:04.800
They are the emulators of Great Britain.

02:52:15.800 --> 02:52:21.800
They believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

02:52:21.800 --> 02:52:25.800
They're always happy and goes at play.

02:52:25.800 --> 02:52:29.800
The movements are having fun day after day.

02:52:29.800 --> 02:52:32.800
The movements.

02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:36.800
The movements.

02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:42.800
The movements.

02:52:45.800 --> 02:52:52.800
The movements.

02:53:15.800 --> 02:53:22.800
They are the movements.

02:53:22.800 --> 02:53:25.800
They are the movements.

02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:28.800
So come with me, give me your hand.

02:53:28.800 --> 02:53:31.800
I'll take you up to a moment land.

02:53:31.800 --> 02:53:34.800
You can fly just like a bird.

02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:36.800
Sing that song ever.

02:53:36.800 --> 02:53:39.800
There were the movements.

02:53:39.800 --> 02:53:43.800
There were the movements.

02:53:43.800 --> 02:53:48.800
There were the movements.

02:53:48.800 --> 02:53:53.800
There were the movements.

02:53:53.800 --> 02:54:02.800
Snort Maiden was in a very good mood.

02:54:02.800 --> 02:54:06.800
Because that day she was off to collect shells of the sea shore with moon.

02:54:06.800 --> 02:54:16.800
Moonman.

02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:25.800
Hey look, the sun's up and there's Gracie.

02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:29.800
What's the matter Papa?

02:54:29.800 --> 02:54:31.800
What's your moment?

02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:32.800
What are you doing?

02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:35.800
I heard you talking to yourself just now.

02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:39.800
Oh.

02:54:39.800 --> 02:54:42.800
You see this? I'm writing a play.

02:54:42.800 --> 02:54:43.800
Writing a play.

02:54:43.800 --> 02:54:45.800
You remember the last children?

02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:47.800
That was a very successful play.

02:54:47.800 --> 02:54:49.800
Just now I was repeating a line.

02:54:49.800 --> 02:54:53.800
Hey look, another beautiful day and there goes Gracie.

02:54:53.800 --> 02:54:56.800
It's a wonderful line, of course.

02:54:56.800 --> 02:54:57.800
Don't you agree?

02:54:57.800 --> 02:54:59.800
It could be improved.

02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:02.800
I think about it.

02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:05.800
Yeah.

02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:15.800
Well, wait, wait, look at this.

02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:20.800
Beautiful.

02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:21.800
You find anything?

02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:30.800
No, just usual old stuff.

02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:33.800
Oh, there's another big one.

02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:38.800
Can't you really find anything, Moonman?

02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:40.800
I'll look somewhere else.

02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:42.800
I still think this is the best place.

02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:46.800
Well, I'm going over there.

02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:50.800
You're so beautiful.

02:55:50.800 --> 02:55:54.800
Oh.

02:55:54.800 --> 02:55:56.800
What are you doing, Moonman?

02:55:56.800 --> 02:55:58.800
No, that's no shell surely.

02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:00.800
Oh, so why did you take it out?

02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:05.800
Well, once you see it, you want to find out what it is.

02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:07.800
A very odd thing, isn't it?

02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:10.800
Not very interesting.

02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:16.800
Oh no, I can see what it is.

02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:18.800
I gave it a good wash.

02:56:18.800 --> 02:56:20.800
I see one just like it in the fairy tales.

02:56:20.800 --> 02:56:21.800
It's an old lamp.

02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:24.800
Yes, you remember the story called a ladder?

02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:26.800
He rubbed the lamp and the genie appeared.

02:56:26.800 --> 02:56:30.800
The genie might appear for us if we do what Aladdin did.

02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:33.800
Don't be silly, Snork Maiden.

02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:36.800
Hmm.

02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:40.800
But Snork Maiden, that was a fairy tale.

02:56:40.800 --> 02:56:43.800
Don't laugh, I just want to make absolutely sure.

02:56:43.800 --> 02:56:46.800
The tell you the truth, I've already tried it.

02:56:46.800 --> 02:56:49.800
My hands turned green, that's all that happened to me.

02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:51.800
Maybe you didn't do it the right way.

02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:54.800
You can't even whip cream properly.

02:56:54.800 --> 02:56:57.800
And I'm sure you have to say some magic words,

02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:00.800
such as, apricot dapura, spirit, come forth,

02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:03.800
apricot dapura, try for all your words.

02:57:03.800 --> 02:57:05.800
You've chosen the wrong words.

02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:08.800
You should say, come out, say something or something.

02:57:08.800 --> 02:57:09.800
Huh?

02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:11.800
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness!

02:57:11.800 --> 02:57:13.800
Keep going, Snork Maiden.

02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:15.800
Ah!

02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:19.800
I am the spirit of the lamp.

02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:22.800
What is your command?

02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:26.800
Goodness, did you come out of this lamp?

02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:27.800
You got it.

02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:30.800
So you really are the spirit of this lamp?

02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:31.800
Always have been.

02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:35.800
But, but I have the book and you're not him.

02:57:35.800 --> 02:57:37.800
I can't believe it.

02:57:37.800 --> 02:57:39.800
I've never heard of it before.

02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:41.800
I've never heard of it before.

02:57:41.800 --> 02:57:43.800
I've never heard of it before.

02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:44.800
You're not him.

02:57:44.800 --> 02:57:48.800
I can prove it if you're quite sure you want me to.

02:57:48.800 --> 02:57:51.800
By all means, it probably wasn't a good picture.

02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:54.800
I'm the one and only spirit of the lamp.

02:57:54.800 --> 02:57:58.800
Ah, then you must have the power to make any wish come true.

02:57:58.800 --> 02:57:59.800
Is that so?

02:57:59.800 --> 02:58:01.800
Her wish, certainly, but not yours.

02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:03.800
But I'm the one who'll dug you out.

02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:05.800
That's not so important, kid.

02:58:05.800 --> 02:58:08.800
She's the one who summoned me forth from the lamp.

02:58:08.800 --> 02:58:10.800
What are we going to do about this spirit?

02:58:10.800 --> 02:58:11.800
Why?

02:58:11.800 --> 02:58:12.800
Ask for something.

02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:14.800
Ask for something you've always wanted.

02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:16.800
Ah, let's see.

02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:17.800
A pearl necklace.

02:58:17.800 --> 02:58:18.800
Sorry, me.

02:58:18.800 --> 02:58:20.800
Your wish is my command.

02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:23.800
Hey, wait a minute.

02:58:23.800 --> 02:58:24.800
Oh.

02:58:24.800 --> 02:58:27.800
A pearl necklace is only one of the things I wanted.

02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:28.800
I hadn't decided yet.

02:58:28.800 --> 02:58:30.800
Don't worry, Snork Maiden.

02:58:30.800 --> 02:58:32.800
I guess you can always send it back.

02:58:32.800 --> 02:58:35.800
If I like the necklace, then it's your turn to wrap the lamp.

02:58:35.800 --> 02:58:37.800
Then you can wish for whatever you've always wanted.

02:58:37.800 --> 02:58:38.800
Yes.

02:58:39.800 --> 02:58:41.800
But where exactly did you rub the lamp?

02:58:41.800 --> 02:58:44.800
Right here, and very, very slowly.

02:58:44.800 --> 02:58:45.800
All right.

02:58:45.800 --> 02:58:47.800
I'll say, spirit come forth.

02:58:47.800 --> 02:58:50.800
It sounds a little better than come out, spirit.

02:58:56.800 --> 02:58:57.800
Oh, nice.

02:58:57.800 --> 02:58:59.800
What was that?

02:58:59.800 --> 02:59:00.800
Always back.

02:59:05.800 --> 02:59:07.800
One royal necklace, Miss.

02:59:08.800 --> 02:59:10.800
This is incredible.

02:59:10.800 --> 02:59:11.800
Right.

02:59:11.800 --> 02:59:14.800
I do think this is exactly what I wanted.

02:59:14.800 --> 02:59:16.800
Oh, thank you ever so much.

02:59:16.800 --> 02:59:17.800
All in a day's wake.

02:59:17.800 --> 02:59:19.800
So pleased to oblige, Miss.

02:59:22.800 --> 02:59:24.800
Are you going back into the lamp?

02:59:24.800 --> 02:59:25.800
Yes, I am.

02:59:25.800 --> 02:59:26.800
I'm so happy.

02:59:26.800 --> 02:59:28.800
Now it's my turn to let you out of here.

02:59:28.800 --> 02:59:31.800
I'd like to have a wish granted, too, please.

02:59:31.800 --> 02:59:33.800
Now, wait a minute.

02:59:33.800 --> 02:59:35.800
If getting in and out is a bother,

02:59:35.800 --> 02:59:38.800
why don't you let me give you my wish right now?

02:59:38.800 --> 02:59:39.800
Can't do it, young man.

02:59:39.800 --> 02:59:41.800
One at a time in the face to call.

02:59:41.800 --> 02:59:43.800
Just wanted to save time.

02:59:43.800 --> 02:59:45.800
Impossible, young say.

02:59:45.800 --> 02:59:46.800
But why?

02:59:46.800 --> 02:59:49.800
Because I am only able to fulfill one wish a week.

02:59:49.800 --> 02:59:51.800
I need my rest.

02:59:51.800 --> 02:59:52.800
It's hard work, you know.

02:59:52.800 --> 02:59:55.800
Oh, well, of course it's tiring.

02:59:55.800 --> 02:59:57.800
Perhaps I expected too much from you.

02:59:57.800 --> 02:59:58.800
Hold on.

02:59:58.800 --> 03:00:00.800
I wouldn't like you to think that I haven't got the power.

03:00:00.800 --> 03:00:03.800
I can do many extraordinary things.

03:00:03.800 --> 03:00:04.800
What kind of things?

03:00:04.800 --> 03:00:05.800
Not telling you.

03:00:12.800 --> 03:00:13.800
Listen, moment.

03:00:13.800 --> 03:00:15.800
We won't tell a soul about this lamp, alright?

03:00:15.800 --> 03:00:16.800
Of course not.

03:00:35.800 --> 03:00:36.800
No!

03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:38.800
Names don't really matter.

03:00:38.800 --> 03:00:41.800
Tulip Hydrangea, who cares?

03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:43.800
No, that's not right somehow.

03:00:43.800 --> 03:00:45.800
And uranium, a fox glove.

03:00:45.800 --> 03:00:47.800
Oh, I'm so tired.

03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:07.800
Oh, yeah.

03:01:16.800 --> 03:01:18.800
Hmm.

03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:21.800
Praise the lad and I didn't tell them I can get out at night.

03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:23.800
I'd have no peace at all.

03:01:23.800 --> 03:01:26.800
My leisure time would be totally ruined by these two.

03:01:26.800 --> 03:01:30.800
Good thing also I can read their minds so I know what I'm up against.

03:01:30.800 --> 03:01:33.800
They're up to something I know they are.

03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:38.800
Oh, yes, dear me, dear me.

03:01:38.800 --> 03:01:41.800
No wonder the young man is worried to death.

03:01:41.800 --> 03:01:42.800
She was.

03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:44.800
I better rewrite this.

03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:49.800
Oh, Edgar, Edgar, I do wish you was somebody else.

03:01:49.800 --> 03:01:52.800
This will certainly have to be changed.

03:01:52.800 --> 03:01:54.800
The whole page, really.

03:01:55.800 --> 03:01:58.800
What's going on here?

03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:01.800
Who did this?

03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:04.800
Mom, not you surely.

03:02:04.800 --> 03:02:05.800
What?

03:02:05.800 --> 03:02:06.800
What?

03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:07.800
What?

03:02:07.800 --> 03:02:08.800
What?

03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:09.800
What?

03:02:09.800 --> 03:02:10.800
What?

03:02:10.800 --> 03:02:11.800
What?

03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:12.800
What?

03:02:12.800 --> 03:02:13.800
What?

03:02:13.800 --> 03:02:14.800
What?

03:02:14.800 --> 03:02:15.800
What?

03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:16.800
What?

03:02:16.800 --> 03:02:17.800
What?

03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:18.800
What?

03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:19.800
What?

03:02:19.800 --> 03:02:20.800
What?

03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:21.800
What?

03:02:21.800 --> 03:02:22.800
What?

03:02:22.800 --> 03:02:23.800
What?

03:02:23.800 --> 03:02:24.800
What?

03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:25.800
What?

03:02:25.800 --> 03:02:27.800
Some rascals have been rewriting my play.

03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:29.800
Who could that possibly be?

03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:32.800
Who in need in the middle of the night while I was asleep?

03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:34.800
It's very strange, isn't it, Papa?

03:02:34.800 --> 03:02:36.800
It can't be you, Mom.

03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:38.800
Of course not, Papa.

03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:40.800
I am upset.

03:02:40.800 --> 03:02:41.800
Who can it be?

03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:44.800
Imagine going into your study while you were fast asleep.

03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:46.800
It's very rude, isn't it?

03:02:46.800 --> 03:02:49.800
I find it incredible that anyone could do such a thing.

03:02:49.800 --> 03:02:52.800
And all the rewriting was done on those bits as I knew

03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:54.800
weren't perfectly polished.

03:02:54.800 --> 03:02:58.800
Listen, dear, I'm sure they were far too good for him to improve on.

03:02:58.800 --> 03:03:00.800
No, no, you're wrong.

03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:02.800
That's the worst thing.

03:03:02.800 --> 03:03:04.800
I must admit he did improve them.

03:03:04.800 --> 03:03:07.800
Then I think you should feel pleased, dear.

03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:08.800
Yes.

03:03:08.800 --> 03:03:10.800
No, I'm not a bit pleased.

03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:12.800
A dramatist should write his own plays.

03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:14.800
Looks great, Snork Maiden.

03:03:14.800 --> 03:03:16.800
That is, if you like necklaces.

03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:18.800
Thank you, Little Maiden.

03:03:18.800 --> 03:03:20.800
It was given to me as a present.

03:03:20.800 --> 03:03:21.800
Rather nice.

03:03:21.800 --> 03:03:23.800
Would you mind if I tried it on for a minute?

03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:24.800
Of course not.

03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:26.800
I'm sure you'll look gorgeous.

03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:30.800
I suppose in time one could get to like necklaces.

03:03:30.800 --> 03:03:33.800
I could ask for a similar one for you.

03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:36.800
Deepers, who's your rich friend?

03:03:36.800 --> 03:03:37.800
Yes.

03:03:37.800 --> 03:03:41.800
I searched the whole house, but I can't find it anywhere.

03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:43.800
Someone must have stolen it.

03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:47.800
The three Mrs. Philly Junk, I fully expect to arrest the thief any minute now.

03:03:47.800 --> 03:03:49.800
Good afternoon, Inspector.

03:03:49.800 --> 03:03:50.800
Hello, Snork Maiden.

03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:52.800
Please hurry, Inspector.

03:03:52.800 --> 03:03:55.800
The thief has almost certainly left Moomin Valley already.

03:03:55.800 --> 03:03:56.800
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

03:03:56.800 --> 03:03:58.800
Nothing is safe in this valley anymore.

03:03:58.800 --> 03:04:00.800
Now calm down, Mrs. Philly Junk.

03:04:00.800 --> 03:04:04.800
Did you just say you've had something stolen, Mrs. Philly Junk?

03:04:04.800 --> 03:04:08.800
My pearl necklace, extraordinarily beautiful pearls, 87 of them.

03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:11.800
Looks just like the one you're wearing, Little Maiden.

03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:14.800
You stole it.

03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:16.800
Did you?

03:04:16.800 --> 03:04:17.800
Oh!

03:04:17.800 --> 03:04:18.800
Oh, no, no!

03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:19.800
What are you doing?

03:04:19.800 --> 03:04:20.800
What are you doing?

03:04:20.800 --> 03:04:21.800
Doctor!

03:04:21.800 --> 03:04:22.800
Doctor!

03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:23.800
Arrest her!

03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:25.800
First, believe her she's a bee, she's innocent!

03:04:25.800 --> 03:04:27.800
Little Maiden's beauty!

03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:30.800
The smallest character of the most cunning and generous!

03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:31.800
Yes!

03:04:31.800 --> 03:04:34.800
This is Snork Maiden's necklace.

03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:36.800
No, that's very funny, Mr. Philly!

03:04:36.800 --> 03:04:39.800
Is that the best explanation you can think of?

03:04:39.800 --> 03:04:43.280
No one calls Little Maya Thief and gets away with it.

03:04:43.280 --> 03:04:46.240
Is it really true that this is your necklace, Nork Maiden?

03:04:46.240 --> 03:04:49.480
Of course, Inspector. It was a present. I swear it.

03:04:49.480 --> 03:04:50.760
Who gave it to you?

03:04:50.760 --> 03:04:53.120
That's a secret between me and Moomin.

03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:54.520
A secret?

03:04:54.520 --> 03:04:57.280
That's a lie. They stole it, Inspector.

03:04:57.280 --> 03:04:59.880
I've never known them to lie before, Mrs. Philly John.

03:04:59.880 --> 03:05:01.560
They're from a very bad background.

03:05:01.560 --> 03:05:02.800
You should see their home.

03:05:02.800 --> 03:05:03.840
Zora!

03:05:03.840 --> 03:05:05.680
I'm going to get fucked up.

03:05:05.680 --> 03:05:07.400
Stop the little man.

03:05:07.400 --> 03:05:09.360
Bad background and you got ten things.

03:05:09.360 --> 03:05:10.360
You say that.

03:05:10.360 --> 03:05:11.840
No, there's something I want to ask you.

03:05:11.840 --> 03:05:12.840
Little Maya.

03:05:12.840 --> 03:05:13.840
What are you doing?

03:05:13.840 --> 03:05:14.840
No!

03:05:14.840 --> 03:05:16.840
Little Maya has to be a pain, you know.

03:05:25.480 --> 03:05:26.480
This is it.

03:05:32.680 --> 03:05:34.480
I love to know who did this.

03:05:34.480 --> 03:05:36.680
He's sitting there going to knock with words.

03:05:36.680 --> 03:05:37.680
What?

03:05:37.680 --> 03:05:38.680
Huh?

03:05:38.680 --> 03:05:41.440
Listen to this. This is a good example.

03:05:41.440 --> 03:05:45.640
Hey, look at the sky. The sun's up and there's Gracie.

03:05:45.640 --> 03:05:48.600
That's not great. Sounds very ordinary.

03:05:48.600 --> 03:05:50.520
That's what I wrote, Snuffkin.

03:05:50.520 --> 03:05:52.520
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:05:52.520 --> 03:05:53.600
That's all right.

03:05:53.600 --> 03:05:56.000
Now, listen to how he rewrote it.

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:59.880
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks.

03:05:59.880 --> 03:06:02.320
It is the East, and Juliet is the sun.

03:06:02.320 --> 03:06:04.400
Arise, Verson.

03:06:04.400 --> 03:06:07.640
And kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale

03:06:07.640 --> 03:06:09.440
with grief.

03:06:09.440 --> 03:06:11.120
What a sunrise.

03:06:11.120 --> 03:06:13.240
And note how clever this writer is to change

03:06:13.240 --> 03:06:16.400
her name from Gracie to Juliet.

03:06:16.400 --> 03:06:18.440
Gracie's worried because her parents don't approve

03:06:18.440 --> 03:06:20.000
of her love, Edgar.

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:22.040
I had it as names don't matter.

03:06:22.040 --> 03:06:24.440
Tulip, I'd rangers, who cares?

03:06:24.440 --> 03:06:25.840
But listen to this.

03:06:25.840 --> 03:06:27.080
What's in a name?

03:06:27.080 --> 03:06:29.560
That which we call a rose by any other name

03:06:29.560 --> 03:06:33.600
would smell as sweet, much more romantic.

03:06:33.600 --> 03:06:34.600
I got a show.

03:06:34.600 --> 03:06:35.600
Oh, you wouldn't.

03:06:35.600 --> 03:06:37.320
Or he'd not a Romeo called.

03:06:37.320 --> 03:06:38.760
Oh, it's simply great.

03:06:38.760 --> 03:06:41.240
Except maybe I wouldn't have mentioned his smell.

03:06:41.240 --> 03:06:45.080
Don't you agree, he's an excellent playwright.

03:06:45.080 --> 03:06:46.040
Yes, I agree.

03:06:46.040 --> 03:06:48.440
He sounds like a very promising playwright.

03:06:48.440 --> 03:06:50.880
And then wordy, perhaps, but really good.

03:06:50.880 --> 03:06:52.760
Very good indeed.

03:06:52.760 --> 03:06:55.520
Write him a note asking him to carry on.

03:06:55.520 --> 03:06:57.080
And there might not be necessary.

03:06:57.080 --> 03:06:59.560
You know, all the changes were made in the middle of the night

03:06:59.560 --> 03:07:01.880
while I was fast asleep, and usually

03:07:01.880 --> 03:07:04.120
writers are in their beds, none of their desks

03:07:04.120 --> 03:07:06.960
when they're asleep.

03:07:06.960 --> 03:07:10.440
Well, yes, that's the only time you're not at your desk, isn't it?

03:07:10.440 --> 03:07:13.400
But there are people you know who walk about at night

03:07:13.400 --> 03:07:16.000
without remembering about it the next morning.

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:17.680
Sleepwalk, as you mean.

03:07:17.680 --> 03:07:19.160
Now I come to think of it.

03:07:19.160 --> 03:07:21.680
You were rather sleepy when you woke up this morning.

03:07:21.680 --> 03:07:25.200
You're right, Mum and Mama, even sleepier than usual.

03:07:25.200 --> 03:07:26.440
Just so.

03:07:26.440 --> 03:07:28.640
You mean you yourself got up at night

03:07:28.640 --> 03:07:31.640
and then went and rewrote the play in your sleep?

03:07:31.640 --> 03:07:35.600
Well, yes, I have been worried about some minor things

03:07:35.600 --> 03:07:37.000
in my play.

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:40.800
So my subconsciousness, fairly rich and literary talent,

03:07:40.800 --> 03:07:43.000
as we all know, comes to the rescue.

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:44.120
A moment, Papa.

03:07:44.120 --> 03:07:47.720
And in my sleep, my imagination runs riot.

03:07:47.720 --> 03:07:49.880
I have all sorts of good ideas that make me

03:07:49.880 --> 03:07:51.720
grab a pen in the middle of the night

03:07:51.720 --> 03:07:57.600
and rush to my room to let the real skill throw.

03:07:57.600 --> 03:07:58.960
Got it.

03:07:58.960 --> 03:07:59.800
I got it.

03:07:59.800 --> 03:08:00.760
I got it.

03:08:00.760 --> 03:08:02.680
With this, I can have anything.

03:08:02.680 --> 03:08:04.240
I can do anything.

03:08:04.240 --> 03:08:05.240
Stop.

03:08:05.240 --> 03:08:06.240
Stop.

03:08:06.240 --> 03:08:08.680
When I say stop, you have to stop.

03:08:08.680 --> 03:08:10.720
He's not expecting me.

03:08:10.720 --> 03:08:14.720
I can be a fan of him, so you already.

03:08:14.720 --> 03:08:16.880
We've arrived when you weren't getting last.

03:08:16.880 --> 03:08:18.040
Get lost yourself.

03:08:18.040 --> 03:08:19.560
I don't have time for you.

03:08:19.560 --> 03:08:21.440
The inspector's chasing me.

03:08:21.440 --> 03:08:22.480
What, you?

03:08:22.480 --> 03:08:23.520
Stop, little boy.

03:08:23.520 --> 03:08:24.440
I'm the inspector.

03:08:24.440 --> 03:08:26.080
You have to stop when I say so.

03:08:26.080 --> 03:08:27.840
He's not chasing me, Mum.

03:08:27.840 --> 03:08:28.800
Don't deny it.

03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:29.880
I know why you're running.

03:08:29.880 --> 03:08:31.440
You stole that thing, didn't you?

03:08:31.440 --> 03:08:33.440
I know it's true.

03:08:33.440 --> 03:08:35.080
That's from the pure business.

03:08:35.080 --> 03:08:36.400
It's not yours.

03:08:36.400 --> 03:08:39.280
But it must be somebody, so I'll make it my business.

03:08:39.280 --> 03:08:40.960
Get it to me.

03:08:40.960 --> 03:08:42.520
Or is that me?

03:08:42.520 --> 03:08:46.880
Please stop me, I'm going to give it back to me.

03:08:46.880 --> 03:08:51.160
Hey, that looks like the lamp we've found.

03:08:51.160 --> 03:08:53.400
Chase him, it's better not be.

03:08:53.400 --> 03:08:54.880
Oh, no.

03:08:54.880 --> 03:08:58.920
Well, man, Stinky's got our magic lamp right after him.

03:08:58.920 --> 03:08:59.920
Yes.

03:08:59.920 --> 03:09:01.040
We can't let him get away with it.

03:09:01.040 --> 03:09:03.240
Our terrible things might happen.

03:09:03.240 --> 03:09:05.280
Did you hear that, Stinky?

03:09:05.280 --> 03:09:07.840
He said magic lamp or something.

03:09:07.840 --> 03:09:09.400
After him.

03:09:09.400 --> 03:09:10.840
The magic lamp is mine.

03:09:10.840 --> 03:09:12.360
Just leave me alone.

03:09:12.360 --> 03:09:13.960
Well, you guys, Stinky.

03:09:13.960 --> 03:09:15.880
Help me get the necklace.

03:09:15.880 --> 03:09:16.760
No, no, no, no.

03:09:16.760 --> 03:09:18.320
This one is taking me.

03:09:18.320 --> 03:09:19.400
Oh, no.

03:09:19.400 --> 03:09:20.400
Oh, no.

03:09:20.400 --> 03:09:21.400
Get a stick.

03:09:21.400 --> 03:09:22.400
Get a stick.

03:09:22.400 --> 03:09:23.400
Oh, no.

03:09:23.400 --> 03:09:24.400
Get a stick.

03:09:24.400 --> 03:09:25.400
Get a stick.

03:09:25.400 --> 03:09:26.400
Get a stick.

03:09:26.400 --> 03:09:27.400
Get a stick.

03:09:27.400 --> 03:09:28.400
Get a stick.

03:09:28.400 --> 03:09:29.400
Oh, my dear.

03:09:29.400 --> 03:09:30.400
He's coming.

03:09:30.400 --> 03:09:31.400
He's coming.

03:09:31.400 --> 03:09:32.400
No.

03:09:32.400 --> 03:09:33.400
Oh.

03:09:33.400 --> 03:09:41.640
You're the spirit of the lamp, aren't you?

03:09:41.640 --> 03:09:42.640
Yes, my master.

03:09:42.640 --> 03:09:43.640
What is your wish?

03:09:43.640 --> 03:09:44.640
You his master?

03:09:44.640 --> 03:09:45.640
Yes, me.

03:09:45.640 --> 03:09:47.640
I'm the master.

03:09:47.640 --> 03:09:50.800
I let him out, so he'll do what I say.

03:09:50.800 --> 03:09:54.840
I don't believe a word of this fairy tale's untrue.

03:09:54.840 --> 03:09:57.200
Maybe it isn't true, but it works.

03:09:57.200 --> 03:10:01.440
I saw a snork maiden wishing for a pearl necklace, and her wish was granted.

03:10:01.440 --> 03:10:04.440
Uh-huh, so you're responsible.

03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:06.640
Yeah, and I brought it right away.

03:10:06.640 --> 03:10:09.280
God, now let me see.

03:10:09.280 --> 03:10:11.800
What do I want more than anything in the world?

03:10:11.800 --> 03:10:15.080
Stinky, he can only make one wish a week come true.

03:10:15.080 --> 03:10:16.680
You'll have to wait your turn.

03:10:16.680 --> 03:10:19.760
No, that's very unfair.

03:10:19.760 --> 03:10:21.360
Let's get back to the necklace.

03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:22.960
Where did you steal it from, mister?

03:10:22.960 --> 03:10:23.960
I don't steal.

03:10:23.960 --> 03:10:26.680
Well, then tell me where you found it.

03:10:26.680 --> 03:10:28.280
Around here somewhere.

03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:30.360
Mrs. Philly, John's house, baby.

03:10:30.360 --> 03:10:31.760
I don't know who lives there.

03:10:31.760 --> 03:10:34.040
Oh, then you did steal the necklace.

03:10:34.040 --> 03:10:37.160
Well, that's a lot easier, you know.

03:10:37.160 --> 03:10:41.400
How about a magic key that can open anything, Boltson safes and stuff, huh?

03:10:41.400 --> 03:10:44.120
Listen, there's something I'd like to ask you.

03:10:44.120 --> 03:10:48.040
A sack of gold wouldn't be half as much fun as a key that opens anything.

03:10:48.040 --> 03:10:51.920
Tell me, is it possible that you rewrote woman poppers play?

03:10:51.920 --> 03:10:52.920
Yes, I did.

03:10:52.920 --> 03:10:54.240
It was really awful.

03:10:54.240 --> 03:10:56.920
Oh, come on, now I just needed some polishing.

03:10:56.920 --> 03:11:00.480
And what's more, see this young man standing here?

03:11:00.480 --> 03:11:03.400
Well, he was really worried about your play, you know.

03:11:03.400 --> 03:11:04.920
I was just trying to help.

03:11:04.920 --> 03:11:05.920
Is this true?

03:11:05.920 --> 03:11:09.280
Yeah, safer than mercury, of course.

03:11:09.280 --> 03:11:12.400
But then there's professional pride to think of.

03:11:12.400 --> 03:11:13.680
I can explain, Papa.

03:11:13.680 --> 03:11:15.720
I saw you weren't happy about your play,

03:11:15.720 --> 03:11:19.160
and I wanted it to be a big success.

03:11:19.160 --> 03:11:21.880
Of course, I didn't want the spirit to write it himself.

03:11:21.880 --> 03:11:23.800
I'm going to take the key, yeah.

03:11:23.800 --> 03:11:27.880
I've just realized, everybody, the spirit didn't write all that himself.

03:11:27.880 --> 03:11:29.080
I've heard it before.

03:11:29.080 --> 03:11:30.880
I thought it sounded familiar.

03:11:30.880 --> 03:11:32.680
Really, is that so?

03:11:32.680 --> 03:11:36.160
Yes, he stole it from a play by somebody else.

03:11:36.160 --> 03:11:38.960
This spirit is a cheat and a liar.

03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:41.200
Oh, dear me.

03:11:41.200 --> 03:11:43.200
Well, I can't help being so well read.

03:11:43.200 --> 03:11:44.640
Can I go back in the lamp now?

03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:46.760
No, wait, don't run, yes, don't.

03:11:46.760 --> 03:11:48.600
I want to explain this now.

03:11:48.600 --> 03:11:50.320
Sorry, Master, can't oblige.

03:11:50.320 --> 03:11:52.880
Have them put into an impossible situation.

03:11:52.880 --> 03:11:53.880
See you next week.

03:11:58.160 --> 03:12:00.000
But that's ridiculous.

03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:03.320
Not next week, nor next month, nor even next year.

03:12:03.320 --> 03:12:05.680
Stinky, this lamp is not yours.

03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:08.600
Besides, I know exactly the sort of thing you'd ask for.

03:12:08.600 --> 03:12:11.960
A master key or something.

03:12:11.960 --> 03:12:14.880
You think you can hide that magic lamp from me, do you?

03:12:14.880 --> 03:12:19.880
Well, there's no hiding place good enough for that.

03:12:19.880 --> 03:12:21.920
Well, then, I really do think that lamp

03:12:21.920 --> 03:12:25.000
is a bit too dangerous to have a rod.

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:26.800
I think you're right.

03:12:26.800 --> 03:12:29.600
Snuffkin, do you have any good ideas for us?

03:12:43.080 --> 03:12:45.520
We can pass, so we can summon the spirit again.

03:12:49.880 --> 03:12:55.880
There's the inspector.

03:13:01.880 --> 03:13:03.880
You do it, Snuffkin.

03:13:03.880 --> 03:13:04.880
Call the spirit.

03:13:13.880 --> 03:13:14.880
Oh, no, not again.

03:13:14.880 --> 03:13:16.880
What do you want this time?

03:13:16.880 --> 03:13:18.880
Can you bring the hobgoblin here?

03:13:19.880 --> 03:13:20.880
I suppose so.

03:13:20.880 --> 03:13:22.880
I'll be back as soon as I can.

03:13:29.880 --> 03:13:32.880
But why on earth do you want the hobgoblin?

03:13:32.880 --> 03:13:36.880
As far as I can see, there's only one safe place for the lamp

03:13:36.880 --> 03:13:38.880
where no one can find it.

03:13:38.880 --> 03:13:41.880
And that's on another planet, and the only one who can put it there

03:13:41.880 --> 03:13:43.880
is the hobgoblin.

03:13:43.880 --> 03:13:44.880
He's coming any minute.

03:13:44.880 --> 03:13:47.880
Geez, that guy ever hard to find.

03:13:47.880 --> 03:13:48.880
Thank you.

03:13:48.880 --> 03:13:50.880
I've done my wake for this week.

03:13:50.880 --> 03:13:51.880
See you next week.

03:13:51.880 --> 03:13:52.880
Goodbye!

03:14:10.880 --> 03:14:13.880
And some of the hobgoblin took the magic ram away

03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:16.880
and hid it on some unknown planet.

03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:20.880
And a good thing too, it would really be very boring

03:14:20.880 --> 03:14:23.880
if all your wishes were granted, wouldn't it?

03:14:46.880 --> 03:14:51.880
The day after day, the moon is.

03:14:51.880 --> 03:14:55.880
The moon is.

03:14:55.880 --> 03:15:00.880
The moon is.

03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:26.880
Here they are for one and all.

03:15:26.880 --> 03:15:29.880
The movements are about to come.

03:15:29.880 --> 03:15:32.880
Come on and sit down here with me.

03:15:32.880 --> 03:15:34.880
They're for you on your TV.

03:15:34.880 --> 03:15:37.880
They are the movements.

03:15:37.880 --> 03:15:40.880
They are the movements.

03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:43.880
So come with me, give me your hand.

03:15:43.880 --> 03:15:46.880
I'll take you up to a moment land.

03:15:46.880 --> 03:15:49.880
You can fly just like a bird.

03:15:49.880 --> 03:15:52.880
Sing that song ever.

03:15:52.880 --> 03:15:54.880
There were the movements.

03:15:54.880 --> 03:15:57.880
There were the movements.

03:15:57.880 --> 03:16:00.880
There were the movements.

03:16:00.880 --> 03:16:03.880
There were the movements.

03:16:03.880 --> 03:16:06.880
There were the movements.

03:16:06.880 --> 03:16:09.880
There were the movements.

03:16:13.880 --> 03:16:16.880
There were the movements.

03:16:16.880 --> 03:16:19.880
There were the movements.

03:16:19.880 --> 03:16:22.880
There were the movements.

03:16:22.880 --> 03:16:25.880
There were the movements.

03:16:33.880 --> 03:16:36.880
Winter was just around the corner.

03:16:36.880 --> 03:16:42.880
And that was the time of year for movement to get restless.

03:16:42.880 --> 03:16:49.880
Snuffkin, why?

03:16:49.880 --> 03:16:56.880
Because this was the time of year for snuffkin to leave movement valley on his yearly trek south.

03:16:56.880 --> 03:17:06.880
Good morning, Papa.

03:17:06.880 --> 03:17:14.880
That bonfire looks inviting.

03:17:14.880 --> 03:17:16.880
You're up already.

03:17:16.880 --> 03:17:21.880
We're buried in leaves this morning after that wind last night.

03:17:21.880 --> 03:17:23.880
Yes, winders on the way.

03:17:23.880 --> 03:17:26.880
Oh, this is a lovely bonfire.

03:17:26.880 --> 03:17:29.880
Yes, isn't it?

03:17:29.880 --> 03:17:31.880
I guess we're hibernating again this winter.

03:17:31.880 --> 03:17:33.880
Are we moving, Papa?

03:17:33.880 --> 03:17:35.880
Well, of course.

03:17:35.880 --> 03:17:37.880
We always hibernate in the winter.

03:17:37.880 --> 03:17:39.880
If snuffkin says I could go with him,

03:17:39.880 --> 03:17:43.880
couldn't I give this winter a miss and hibernate longer next year?

03:17:43.880 --> 03:17:44.880
More.

03:17:44.880 --> 03:17:46.880
Oh, please, moving, Papa.

03:17:46.880 --> 03:17:49.880
Snuffkin would rather go alone, I think, movement.

03:17:50.880 --> 03:17:53.880
But I might get him to train his mind.

03:17:53.880 --> 03:17:56.880
That snuffkin's not really a person who likes to be pressed.

03:17:56.880 --> 03:17:58.880
Why not?

03:17:58.880 --> 03:18:01.880
Well, he's a very solitary person.

03:18:01.880 --> 03:18:05.880
His winter trip is the only time he can really be alone for a while.

03:18:05.880 --> 03:18:07.880
I know, but I was just hoping.

03:18:07.880 --> 03:18:11.880
Snuffkin likes you very much, I know that.

03:18:11.880 --> 03:18:15.880
And I think that's why he stays in movement valley for the rest of the year.

03:18:15.880 --> 03:18:20.880
But at heart, he's a vagabond and he needs time away from us.

03:18:20.880 --> 03:18:23.880
He's not a family man, so he's free to do as he wants.

03:18:23.880 --> 03:18:26.880
And as his friend, you should try to understand.

03:18:26.880 --> 03:18:30.880
I know you'd like to go with him, but I don't think he's such a good idea.

03:18:30.880 --> 03:18:33.880
He'd really hate to turn you down, I know.

03:18:33.880 --> 03:18:35.880
I guess.

03:18:35.880 --> 03:18:37.880
But he'd have to.

03:18:40.880 --> 03:18:42.880
Oh.

03:18:46.880 --> 03:18:48.880
Oh.

03:18:51.880 --> 03:18:55.880
Why aren't they biting?

03:18:55.880 --> 03:18:58.880
I haven't had a proper catch for days.

03:18:58.880 --> 03:19:00.880
Getting too cold, is that?

03:19:03.880 --> 03:19:05.880
When are you leaving?

03:19:05.880 --> 03:19:07.880
You're about to leave, aren't you?

03:19:07.880 --> 03:19:10.880
Yes.

03:19:11.880 --> 03:19:15.880
Could I ask you something?

03:19:15.880 --> 03:19:17.880
What?

03:19:17.880 --> 03:19:19.880
Don't go without telling me.

03:19:19.880 --> 03:19:21.880
But why?

03:19:21.880 --> 03:19:25.880
I'm always sad when you leave, even though I know you'll return in the spring.

03:19:25.880 --> 03:19:28.880
Yeah. Me too, sort of.

03:19:28.880 --> 03:19:31.880
That's why this year I'd plan to leave without saying anything.

03:19:31.880 --> 03:19:35.880
But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly.

03:19:35.880 --> 03:19:37.880
I'd like to wish you good luck and all that.

03:19:37.880 --> 03:19:39.880
I miss you so much when you're away.

03:19:39.880 --> 03:19:42.880
Please, Nuffkin.

03:19:42.880 --> 03:19:44.880
Moomin, I have a better idea.

03:19:44.880 --> 03:19:46.880
I won't leave until after you've started hibernating.

03:19:46.880 --> 03:19:48.880
Then you won't miss me, will you?

03:19:48.880 --> 03:19:49.880
You're right.

03:19:49.880 --> 03:19:51.880
I'll take me right out here, Snuffkin.

03:19:51.880 --> 03:19:53.880
Then we won't really part at all, won't we?

03:19:53.880 --> 03:19:54.880
Nope.

03:19:54.880 --> 03:19:58.880
Because I promised to be back here in Moomin Valley before you've even woken up.

03:19:58.880 --> 03:20:01.880
Wonderful! What a super idea!

03:20:01.880 --> 03:20:06.880
Hey, Moomin!

03:20:06.880 --> 03:20:08.880
Oh, Snuff.

03:20:08.880 --> 03:20:10.880
Moomin, come here a minute.

03:20:10.880 --> 03:20:12.880
There's something funny caught up in a tree.

03:20:12.880 --> 03:20:14.880
What do you mean, funny?

03:20:14.880 --> 03:20:17.880
I don't know exactly never saw anything like it before.

03:20:17.880 --> 03:20:21.880
Snork made a little myfounded first, but it's too high to get it down.

03:20:21.880 --> 03:20:23.880
Okay, I'll come have a look.

03:20:28.880 --> 03:20:30.880
Be careful.

03:20:32.880 --> 03:20:36.880
Be careful. What is it, Moomin?

03:20:39.880 --> 03:20:42.880
I know what it is. It's a kite.

03:20:42.880 --> 03:20:43.880
Oh, what?

03:20:43.880 --> 03:20:45.880
A kite is something you find in the sky.

03:20:45.880 --> 03:20:47.880
But it has no wings.

03:20:47.880 --> 03:20:50.880
No, you send it up against the wind on a string.

03:20:51.880 --> 03:20:52.880
Bye!

03:21:15.880 --> 03:21:17.880
Be careful.

03:21:17.880 --> 03:21:24.880
Where'd it go?

03:21:24.880 --> 03:21:26.880
Oh, through it though.

03:21:26.880 --> 03:21:34.880
That's all right!

03:21:34.880 --> 03:21:37.880
Oh, song!

03:21:37.880 --> 03:21:40.880
This is what a kite looks like.

03:21:40.880 --> 03:21:42.880
Looks broken to me.

03:21:42.880 --> 03:21:45.880
I'm sure we can fix it and make it fly.

03:21:45.880 --> 03:21:46.880
Let's see.

03:21:46.880 --> 03:21:47.880
Oh, no.

03:21:47.880 --> 03:21:52.880
The string must have broken when someone was flying it and the wind blew it down into the tree.

03:21:52.880 --> 03:21:54.880
Well, why don't we repair it?

03:21:54.880 --> 03:21:55.880
Yes, let's.

03:21:55.880 --> 03:21:57.880
Looks pretty badly broken to me.

03:21:57.880 --> 03:21:58.880
Well, I don't know.

03:21:58.880 --> 03:22:03.880
We'll have to see.

03:22:03.880 --> 03:22:05.880
It is a kite, isn't it?

03:22:05.880 --> 03:22:07.880
Can we mend it?

03:22:07.880 --> 03:22:12.880
Maybe.

03:22:12.880 --> 03:22:14.880
A very odd kite.

03:22:14.880 --> 03:22:16.880
It must have come from far away.

03:22:16.880 --> 03:22:18.880
You think it can be repaired?

03:22:18.880 --> 03:22:19.880
Of course.

03:22:19.880 --> 03:22:20.880
Well, come on then.

03:22:20.880 --> 03:22:22.880
Snork will help you repair it.

03:22:22.880 --> 03:22:24.880
I can repair it without your help.

03:22:24.880 --> 03:22:27.880
As long as you can find us some really long string.

03:22:27.880 --> 03:22:30.880
Strong but not too thick if possible.

03:22:30.880 --> 03:22:32.880
I think I have what you need.

03:22:32.880 --> 03:22:33.880
Some string.

03:22:33.880 --> 03:22:34.880
Good.

03:22:34.880 --> 03:22:35.880
Excellent.

03:22:35.880 --> 03:22:37.880
I'll start immediately.

03:22:42.880 --> 03:22:43.880
Good.

03:22:43.880 --> 03:22:44.880
Good.

03:22:44.880 --> 03:22:45.880
Good.

03:22:45.880 --> 03:22:46.880
Good.

03:22:46.880 --> 03:22:47.880
Good.

03:22:47.880 --> 03:22:48.880
Good.

03:22:48.880 --> 03:22:49.880
Good.

03:22:49.880 --> 03:22:50.880
Good.

03:22:50.880 --> 03:22:51.880
Good.

03:22:51.880 --> 03:22:52.880
Good.

03:22:52.880 --> 03:22:53.880
Good.

03:22:53.880 --> 03:22:54.880
Good.

03:22:54.880 --> 03:22:55.880
Good.

03:22:55.880 --> 03:22:56.880
Good.

03:22:56.880 --> 03:22:57.880
Good.

03:22:57.880 --> 03:22:58.880
Good.

03:22:58.880 --> 03:22:59.880
Good.

03:22:59.880 --> 03:23:00.880
Good.

03:23:00.880 --> 03:23:01.880
Good.

03:23:01.880 --> 03:23:02.880
Good.

03:23:02.880 --> 03:23:03.880
Good.

03:23:03.880 --> 03:23:04.880
Good.

03:23:04.880 --> 03:23:05.880
Good.

03:23:05.880 --> 03:23:06.880
Good.

03:23:06.880 --> 03:23:07.880
Good.

03:23:07.880 --> 03:23:08.880
Good.

03:23:08.880 --> 03:23:10.880
Good.

03:23:10.880 --> 03:23:11.880
Good.

03:23:11.880 --> 03:23:12.880
Good.

03:23:12.880 --> 03:23:13.880
Good.

03:23:13.880 --> 03:23:14.880
Good.

03:23:14.880 --> 03:23:15.880
Good.

03:23:15.880 --> 03:23:16.880
Good.

03:23:16.880 --> 03:23:17.880
Good.

03:23:17.880 --> 03:23:18.880
Good.

03:23:18.880 --> 03:23:19.880
Good.

03:23:19.880 --> 03:23:20.880
Good.

03:23:20.880 --> 03:23:21.880
Good.

03:23:21.880 --> 03:23:22.880
Good.

03:23:22.880 --> 03:23:23.880
Good.

03:23:23.880 --> 03:23:24.880
Good.

03:23:24.880 --> 03:23:25.880
Good.

03:23:25.880 --> 03:23:26.880
Good.

03:23:26.880 --> 03:23:27.880
Good.

03:23:27.880 --> 03:23:28.880
Good.

03:23:28.880 --> 03:23:29.880
Good.

03:23:29.880 --> 03:23:30.880
Good.

03:23:30.880 --> 03:23:31.880
Good.

03:23:31.880 --> 03:23:32.880
Good.

03:23:32.880 --> 03:23:33.880
Good.

03:23:33.880 --> 03:23:34.880
Good.

03:23:34.880 --> 03:23:35.880
Good.

03:23:35.880 --> 03:23:36.880
Hey.

03:23:36.880 --> 03:23:38.880
Thanks for watching.

03:23:38.880 --> 03:23:43.880
This is a really exciting project I haven't flown a kite for years.

03:23:43.880 --> 03:23:46.880
I do hope that string is long enough.

03:23:46.880 --> 03:23:48.880
Snorke, is this okay?

03:23:48.880 --> 03:23:50.880
Fine, who's gonna fly it?

03:23:50.880 --> 03:23:52.880
I'll do it.

03:23:52.880 --> 03:23:53.880
Okay, Sniff.

03:23:53.880 --> 03:23:56.880
Moving, hold the kite up high.

03:23:56.880 --> 03:23:57.880
Like this?

03:23:57.880 --> 03:24:00.880
Hmm. All right, Sniff, are you ready?

03:24:00.880 --> 03:24:04.880
Yeah, I'm ready. Don't let go until I say win.

03:24:08.880 --> 03:24:10.880
Win, moment!

03:24:12.880 --> 03:24:14.880
Ho!

03:24:16.880 --> 03:24:18.880
Uh-oh, it's falling.

03:24:18.880 --> 03:24:24.880
Try again, and this time start running and when the win catches the kite, you start paying out the lie.

03:24:24.880 --> 03:24:27.880
All right, fine. Hold it up again, moment.

03:24:27.880 --> 03:24:29.880
Right.

03:24:29.880 --> 03:24:30.880
Ready?

03:24:30.880 --> 03:24:33.880
Yeah, I'm ready. Let go of it!

03:24:33.880 --> 03:24:36.880
Easy going up, kid!

03:24:38.880 --> 03:24:43.880
No, it isn't! Stop, Sniff! You're breaking the kite!

03:24:43.880 --> 03:24:47.880
I don't think this kite's any good for anybody!

03:24:47.880 --> 03:24:51.880
The kite's fine. It's just that the wind is too weak.

03:24:51.880 --> 03:24:54.880
All right, we'll have to wait for it to get stronger.

03:24:54.880 --> 03:24:58.880
Pretty though, we certainly had a good strong wind yesterday.

03:24:58.880 --> 03:25:00.880
Is it okay?

03:25:00.880 --> 03:25:03.880
I think the wind is getting stronger, moment.

03:25:08.880 --> 03:25:10.880
Oh!

03:25:20.880 --> 03:25:22.880
There it goes!

03:25:28.880 --> 03:25:30.880
Let me hold the string, moment.

03:25:33.880 --> 03:25:36.880
Boy, this wind is really strong! Can I let out the string now?

03:25:36.880 --> 03:25:38.880
Do it slowly, mind!

03:25:38.880 --> 03:25:40.880
All right!

03:25:43.880 --> 03:25:46.880
Let me do it, Sniff! Come on, it's my turn!

03:25:46.880 --> 03:25:48.880
I'm afraid you can't, little lie.

03:25:48.880 --> 03:25:51.880
Why not? Because you don't win, up to all it!

03:25:51.880 --> 03:25:53.880
I'm very strong!

03:25:53.880 --> 03:25:56.880
The wind is quite strong! You come up with it!

03:25:57.880 --> 03:25:58.880
Yes, Papa?

03:25:58.880 --> 03:26:00.880
It's difficult to hold it for a while.

03:26:00.880 --> 03:26:02.880
Well, yes, you'd like it.

03:26:02.880 --> 03:26:04.880
Hold it really tight, then.

03:26:16.880 --> 03:26:20.880
All right, I could do this long before he was born.

03:26:20.880 --> 03:26:22.880
Oops!

03:26:23.880 --> 03:26:26.880
Oh, what's happening?

03:26:28.880 --> 03:26:30.880
Papa, wipe it up quickly.

03:26:30.880 --> 03:26:33.880
And I'm winding, I'm winding.

03:26:33.880 --> 03:26:35.880
Faster, I'm winding faster!

03:26:35.880 --> 03:26:37.880
What's going on?

03:26:37.880 --> 03:26:39.880
What's going on?

03:26:39.880 --> 03:26:41.880
What's going on?

03:26:47.880 --> 03:26:49.880
That was definitely not my fault.

03:26:49.880 --> 03:26:51.880
Of course it wasn't.

03:26:51.880 --> 03:26:53.880
With such a strong wind up there,

03:26:53.880 --> 03:26:56.880
I think we have to lower the centre of gravity a bit.

03:26:59.880 --> 03:27:01.880
The kite's all right, Papa!

03:27:01.880 --> 03:27:05.880
Hmm, maybe it would take me with it.

03:27:19.880 --> 03:27:21.880
That's it!

03:27:21.880 --> 03:27:24.880
I suppose that's to stop it from spinning around. Is it snorke?

03:27:24.880 --> 03:27:26.880
Yes, that's right.

03:27:33.880 --> 03:27:35.880
What is it?

03:27:37.880 --> 03:27:39.880
Listen, I'm going to ride that kite.

03:27:39.880 --> 03:27:41.880
What did you say?

03:27:41.880 --> 03:27:44.880
I think it's going to be okay now.

03:27:44.880 --> 03:27:46.880
If I hold on really tight,

03:27:46.880 --> 03:27:48.880
I think I could have a wonderful ride on that kite.

03:27:48.880 --> 03:27:51.880
Yes, maybe it'd be wonderful while you're up in the sky,

03:27:51.880 --> 03:27:54.880
but you've seen how fast it can come down again.

03:27:54.880 --> 03:27:57.880
But the snorke just said it won't fall down again.

03:27:57.880 --> 03:27:58.880
Even so!

03:27:58.880 --> 03:28:00.880
I'm going to do it, but no one must see me

03:28:00.880 --> 03:28:03.880
or they might try to stop me if they guess what I'm up to.

03:28:03.880 --> 03:28:05.880
Oh, please don't do it.

03:28:05.880 --> 03:28:07.880
What are you doing?

03:28:07.880 --> 03:28:09.880
Listen carefully.

03:28:09.880 --> 03:28:11.880
Yes.

03:28:11.880 --> 03:28:14.880
When we fly the kite next time,

03:28:14.880 --> 03:28:17.880
what are you two whispering about?

03:28:17.880 --> 03:28:19.880
We weren't snorke, Maiden.

03:28:19.880 --> 03:28:22.880
I was just saying to Sniff that the kite wouldn't fall down again.

03:28:22.880 --> 03:28:24.880
It won't! Snorke is fixed it.

03:28:24.880 --> 03:28:26.880
But you can't be absolutely sure.

03:28:26.880 --> 03:28:29.880
And you'll be holding the kite, won't you, Sniff?

03:28:29.880 --> 03:28:30.880
Me?

03:28:30.880 --> 03:28:32.880
Now then, do you want to do it, Moomin?

03:28:32.880 --> 03:28:35.880
Yes, and this time I'll let out all the line.

03:28:35.880 --> 03:28:38.880
And Sniff, you could hold it up, okay?

03:28:38.880 --> 03:28:39.880
Yes, that's fine.

03:28:39.880 --> 03:28:40.880
No!

03:28:40.880 --> 03:28:42.880
I'm counting on you, Sniff.

03:28:42.880 --> 03:28:44.880
And so am I, Sniff.

03:28:44.880 --> 03:28:46.880
Hmm.

03:28:54.880 --> 03:28:56.880
Are you sure you'll be all right?

03:28:56.880 --> 03:28:58.880
Of course I will, silly.

03:28:58.880 --> 03:29:00.880
Well, I'm not so sure.

03:29:00.880 --> 03:29:02.880
Why don't you keep your eyes closed, then?

03:29:02.880 --> 03:29:04.880
Good idea.

03:29:04.880 --> 03:29:06.880
Okay, Sniff.

03:29:06.880 --> 03:29:08.880
Let go of it when I say ready.

03:29:08.880 --> 03:29:10.880
Bye.

03:29:10.880 --> 03:29:12.880
Ready!

03:29:12.880 --> 03:29:14.880
Go!

03:29:14.880 --> 03:29:17.880
Yay!

03:29:17.880 --> 03:29:20.880
Yay!

03:29:20.880 --> 03:29:22.880
Yay!

03:29:22.880 --> 03:29:25.880
Yay!

03:29:25.880 --> 03:29:28.880
Yay!

03:29:28.880 --> 03:29:31.880
Yay!

03:29:31.880 --> 03:29:33.880
Yay, yay!

03:29:33.880 --> 03:29:35.880
Yay!

03:29:35.880 --> 03:29:38.880
Yay!

03:29:38.880 --> 03:30:02.880
That's it. That's all of the line. It's very high. Must be some wind up there. It's flying really well, isn't it? Certainly is.

03:30:02.880 --> 03:30:16.880
This is getting bumpy. What's that? Let's see if there's something very strange happening on that kite.

03:30:16.880 --> 03:30:27.880
What is it? I can't see properly from here. I saw something. Could it be a bird maybe? The kite is turned again, but it wasn't a bird.

03:30:27.880 --> 03:30:36.880
Or a twig or something, then. Did you see the back of the kite from where you are, Sniff? No, Mom and Mama, because my eyes are closed.

03:30:36.880 --> 03:30:42.880
Oh, I think I know who it is. Little Mai. What?

03:30:45.880 --> 03:30:52.880
No, I haven't seen one of my four. She seems to have disappeared. Don't ask me anything. I know nothing at all about it.

03:30:52.880 --> 03:30:59.880
Sniff, what do you mean? Well, she was dead set on riding the kite. I couldn't stop her. What?

03:30:59.880 --> 03:31:03.880
Moment, bring it down very slowly.

03:31:03.880 --> 03:31:17.880
Take it easy, moving. That wind is strong. It could break the line.

03:31:17.880 --> 03:31:28.880
But that was what a friend was best streamed. It's the knot I wore in the board knot. The one between our line and the bit that was still hanging from the kite when we found it.

03:31:28.880 --> 03:31:35.880
The line is fine, if the knot is another one.

03:31:55.880 --> 03:31:57.880
Hang on tight little Mai.

03:31:57.880 --> 03:32:00.880
That wind is getting stronger.

03:32:03.880 --> 03:32:06.880
Oh, this is more scarier than I thought.

03:32:09.880 --> 03:32:12.880
I'll just have to hang on as best as I can.

03:32:14.880 --> 03:32:17.880
Don't move around so much. I can't help it.

03:32:18.880 --> 03:32:22.880
It's almost down. What?

03:32:27.880 --> 03:32:28.880
Oh.

03:32:35.880 --> 03:32:39.880
It's not open. Come on. Sniff, get up.

03:32:39.880 --> 03:32:42.880
All right. Sniff, play yourself together.

03:32:42.880 --> 03:32:44.880
Yes, all right.

03:32:46.880 --> 03:32:49.880
She's being blown away towards lonely mountains.

03:32:49.880 --> 03:32:51.880
Mama!

03:32:51.880 --> 03:32:55.880
Oh, I do hope little Mai really is indestructible.

03:33:03.880 --> 03:33:06.880
Where in the world is this kite taking me?

03:33:08.880 --> 03:33:12.880
All lonely mountains, I'm a long way from home.

03:33:14.880 --> 03:33:16.880
Little Mai! Little Mai!

03:33:17.880 --> 03:33:19.880
Now she's going towards the forest of witches.

03:33:19.880 --> 03:33:22.880
She'll be all right if she fell into a tree, wouldn't she?

03:33:24.880 --> 03:33:26.880
I can't see her. There's no sign of her.

03:33:26.880 --> 03:33:29.880
Well, I'm almost sure she was heading this way.

03:33:32.880 --> 03:33:34.880
What is it, Sniff?

03:33:34.880 --> 03:33:38.880
Imagine she might have fallen somewhere. She might be lying there waiting for help.

03:33:38.880 --> 03:33:41.880
Oh, stop imagining things, Sniff.

03:33:41.880 --> 03:33:43.880
She's still up there. I'm sure of it.

03:33:44.880 --> 03:33:46.880
Huh?

03:33:46.880 --> 03:33:47.880
What is it, Papa?

03:33:47.880 --> 03:33:49.880
I saw something up there.

03:33:49.880 --> 03:33:50.880
Little Mai?

03:33:50.880 --> 03:33:52.880
No, Sniff.

03:33:52.880 --> 03:33:56.880
No, it looked more like the Hobgoblin riding his panther through the sky.

03:33:56.880 --> 03:33:57.880
Really?

03:33:58.880 --> 03:34:00.880
Did you see that? Did you?

03:34:00.880 --> 03:34:02.880
You found the Mai.

03:34:04.880 --> 03:34:06.880
No, the Hobgoblin. Then it was him.

03:34:06.880 --> 03:34:09.880
Forget the Hobgoblin. We're looking for little Mai.

03:34:09.880 --> 03:34:12.880
And all you can think of is the Hobgoblin.

03:34:14.880 --> 03:34:16.880
Oh, come on, let's go out here.

03:34:25.880 --> 03:34:26.880
Oh, come on.

03:34:26.880 --> 03:34:27.880
Oh, come on.

03:34:32.880 --> 03:34:34.880
Oh, come on.

03:34:34.880 --> 03:34:36.880
Oh, come on.

03:34:36.880 --> 03:34:38.880
Oh, come on.

03:34:38.880 --> 03:34:40.880
Oh, no!

03:34:40.880 --> 03:34:43.880
Stop it, you're screaming!

03:34:43.880 --> 03:34:45.880
Let the white hair stop!

03:34:45.880 --> 03:34:46.880
Oh, no!

03:34:46.880 --> 03:34:48.880
Oh, no!

03:34:48.880 --> 03:34:51.880
Oh, no!

03:34:58.880 --> 03:35:00.880
Where could she be?

03:35:00.880 --> 03:35:01.880
This is no good.

03:35:01.880 --> 03:35:05.880
We'll never find her wondering about like this.

03:35:05.880 --> 03:35:07.880
Moomin, over here.

03:35:07.880 --> 03:35:09.880
You found her?

03:35:12.880 --> 03:35:14.880
There she is.

03:35:21.880 --> 03:35:24.880
Try to cheer up, Snork Maiden.

03:35:24.880 --> 03:35:25.880
I'll try.

03:35:25.880 --> 03:35:27.880
Don't worry, Snork Maiden.

03:35:27.880 --> 03:35:29.880
Moomin Papa will find her for sure.

03:35:29.880 --> 03:35:31.880
Eh?

03:35:32.880 --> 03:35:35.880
Mama, Snork Maiden!

03:35:37.880 --> 03:35:39.880
Oh, no!

03:35:43.880 --> 03:35:45.880
I'm so glad to see you.

03:35:45.880 --> 03:35:48.880
But I just knew you'd be alright.

03:35:49.880 --> 03:35:53.880
Like Moomin Mama said, little lie really is indestructible.

03:35:53.880 --> 03:35:57.880
But just possibly it served her right to have her hair pulled.

03:36:02.880 --> 03:36:04.880
Hmm, there's still no sign of little lie?

03:36:04.880 --> 03:36:06.880
No.

03:36:11.880 --> 03:36:13.880
Be careful, Moomin!

03:36:19.880 --> 03:36:21.880
Go!

03:36:25.880 --> 03:36:27.880
Hang on, Moomin!

03:36:27.880 --> 03:36:29.880
To me, Moomin Papa!

03:36:32.880 --> 03:36:35.880
Finally, Lenin was rescued too.

03:36:35.880 --> 03:36:40.880
But he only certainly had a fine worst scar than little lie.

03:36:43.880 --> 03:36:50.880
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

03:36:50.880 --> 03:36:57.880
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

03:36:58.880 --> 03:37:01.880
They're always happy and goes at play.

03:37:01.880 --> 03:37:05.880
The Moons are having fun day after day.

03:37:05.880 --> 03:37:08.880
The Moons!

03:37:08.880 --> 03:37:12.880
The Moons!

03:37:12.880 --> 03:37:18.880
The Moons!

03:37:28.880 --> 03:37:34.880
Here they are for one and all.

03:37:34.880 --> 03:37:37.880
The Moons are about to call.

03:37:37.880 --> 03:37:40.880
Come on and sit down here with me.

03:37:40.880 --> 03:37:43.880
They're here for you on your TV.

03:37:43.880 --> 03:37:45.880
They are the Moons.

03:37:45.880 --> 03:37:48.880
They are the Moons.

03:37:49.880 --> 03:37:52.880
So come with me, give me your hand.

03:37:52.880 --> 03:37:55.880
I'll take you up to Moomin Land.

03:37:55.880 --> 03:37:57.880
You can fly just like a bird.

03:37:57.880 --> 03:38:00.880
Sing the best song ever.

03:38:00.880 --> 03:38:02.880
There were the Moons.

03:38:02.880 --> 03:38:05.880
There were the Moons.

03:38:05.880 --> 03:38:07.880
There were the Moons.

03:38:07.880 --> 03:38:10.880
There were the Moons.

03:38:10.880 --> 03:38:13.880
There were the Moons.

03:38:13.880 --> 03:38:16.880
There were the Moons.

03:38:17.880 --> 03:38:20.880
There were the Moons.

03:38:20.880 --> 03:38:23.880
There were the Moons.

03:38:23.880 --> 03:38:26.880
There were the Moons.

03:38:41.880 --> 03:38:45.880
These days, women and snuffkin were together even more than ever.

03:38:46.880 --> 03:39:01.880
Winter would hit Moomin Valley any day now, and then they would have to part.

03:39:01.880 --> 03:39:09.880
Moomin, to go into hibernation and snuck into me for his trip south.

03:39:09.880 --> 03:39:14.880
Huh? Well, why? You look sad for something upset you?

03:39:14.880 --> 03:39:18.880
Where are you off to, Moomin? To the lonely mountains.

03:39:18.880 --> 03:39:21.880
How come you two are always stealing off somewhere?

03:39:21.880 --> 03:39:25.880
We're not stealing off. We're just going for a walk to lonely mountains.

03:39:25.880 --> 03:39:30.880
Just the two of you? You're even worse than usual, never taking any of us with you.

03:39:30.880 --> 03:39:33.880
I hadn't noticed are we really doing that?

03:39:33.880 --> 03:39:35.880
I'm not sure, maybe we are.

03:39:35.880 --> 03:39:39.880
No, maybe he's about it and let me tell you it's very rude.

03:39:39.880 --> 03:39:43.880
But we were just off for a walk. I know. Well then, why are you going?

03:39:43.880 --> 03:39:48.880
It'll start snowing any day now, little might, and then we won't be able to go anywhere, will we?

03:39:48.880 --> 03:39:52.880
We wanted a last look at Moomin Valley from above before that happens.

03:39:52.880 --> 03:39:53.880
A likely story.

03:39:53.880 --> 03:39:59.880
But it's true. I'm off very soon, and I wanted to see it all to give me a picture to remember while I'm walking.

03:39:59.880 --> 03:40:03.880
Hmm. Did you hear that, Snarkman? Sniff, come here!

03:40:07.880 --> 03:40:11.880
Moomin, do you mind if we come along with you? Of course not.

03:40:11.880 --> 03:40:16.880
You see, we thought you were probably plotting something secret and weren't letting any of us in on it.

03:40:16.880 --> 03:40:21.880
Oh, come on, we don't have any secrets from you. It's just that, well, you know what I mean.

03:40:21.880 --> 03:40:24.880
Sniff can be leaving for months and months very soon.

03:40:24.880 --> 03:40:26.880
Never mind, off we go.

03:40:34.880 --> 03:40:38.880
It would be fun to see it all from here in the middle of winter all white.

03:40:38.880 --> 03:40:40.880
It must be very beautiful.

03:40:40.880 --> 03:40:41.880
Oh, I don't think so.

03:40:41.880 --> 03:40:43.880
With everything white and clean?

03:40:43.880 --> 03:40:45.880
In summer, it's very beautiful.

03:40:45.880 --> 03:40:49.880
Well, I'm coming back here in winter to see it for myself.

03:40:49.880 --> 03:40:51.880
You can't do that, you're hibernating.

03:40:51.880 --> 03:40:56.880
Well, maybe not. I thought that this year I'd try to keep awake all winter.

03:40:56.880 --> 03:40:59.880
You mean just like Moomin and I did last year? Yes!

03:40:59.880 --> 03:41:01.880
You could never do it.

03:41:01.880 --> 03:41:04.880
What about you? Are you hibernating?

03:41:04.880 --> 03:41:09.880
I'm not all that mad about the snow and the cold and dark, so I'll hibernate.

03:41:09.880 --> 03:41:13.880
I'm very happy to be going home. I've seen it all now.

03:41:13.880 --> 03:41:16.880
Well, we didn't ask you to come along a little light.

03:41:16.880 --> 03:41:20.880
Why don't we go take a look at that beautiful lake against Sniff, the one with the golden fish?

03:41:20.880 --> 03:41:22.880
Oh, no, that's too far away.

03:41:22.880 --> 03:41:26.880
You're just afraid of the forest of witches, aren't you, Sniff?

03:41:26.880 --> 03:41:28.880
Not at all, I'm not a bit scared.

03:41:28.880 --> 03:41:31.880
Hey, look! Who's that?

03:41:35.880 --> 03:41:37.880
Nobody I know.

03:41:37.880 --> 03:41:38.880
Wonder what she's doing here.

03:41:38.880 --> 03:41:39.880
Sitting down.

03:41:39.880 --> 03:41:41.880
Don't say such silly things, Sniff.

03:41:48.880 --> 03:41:49.880
Hello there.

03:41:49.880 --> 03:41:50.880
Hello there.

03:41:50.880 --> 03:41:53.880
What are you doing up there?

03:41:54.880 --> 03:41:55.880
I'm waiting.

03:41:55.880 --> 03:41:57.880
For what? For grandma.

03:41:57.880 --> 03:41:59.880
Out here all alone.

03:41:59.880 --> 03:42:05.880
Well, grandma told me there was a big rock by the path leading up to Lonely Mountains and to wait there.

03:42:05.880 --> 03:42:08.880
But there are other rocks by the path, you know?

03:42:08.880 --> 03:42:09.880
Or there?

03:42:11.880 --> 03:42:14.880
But this is the only one I've seen so far.

03:42:14.880 --> 03:42:17.880
Your grandma must be crazy or something making you wait in a place like this.

03:42:17.880 --> 03:42:21.880
No, our house is in the forest and she's coming to show me the way.

03:42:21.880 --> 03:42:22.880
In the forest?

03:42:22.880 --> 03:42:24.880
You mean the forest of witches?

03:42:24.880 --> 03:42:28.880
Yes, I suppose so. It's not very far from here.

03:42:28.880 --> 03:42:30.880
That's it, definitely.

03:42:30.880 --> 03:42:32.880
How long have you been waiting here?

03:42:32.880 --> 03:42:33.880
About an hour.

03:42:33.880 --> 03:42:34.880
One hour?

03:42:34.880 --> 03:42:36.880
She's not very punctual.

03:42:36.880 --> 03:42:38.880
Perhaps I was early.

03:42:38.880 --> 03:42:40.880
Yes, she was an hour early.

03:42:40.880 --> 03:42:42.880
Oh, it's grandma.

03:42:46.880 --> 03:42:48.880
Welcome, Alicia.

03:42:52.880 --> 03:42:55.880
Where do you find all these children, my dear?

03:42:55.880 --> 03:42:59.880
I hear all alone and then they came along the path and waited to help.

03:42:59.880 --> 03:43:01.880
Very kind of you, I'm sure.

03:43:01.880 --> 03:43:05.880
Well, don't just stand there, my dear. Let's go.

03:43:05.880 --> 03:43:07.880
Come along.

03:43:11.880 --> 03:43:15.880
Excuse me, excuse me, ma'am, but don't you live in the forest?

03:43:15.880 --> 03:43:17.880
Indeed I do.

03:43:17.880 --> 03:43:19.880
In what part of it?

03:43:19.880 --> 03:43:21.880
Let me see. It must be about right in the middle.

03:43:21.880 --> 03:43:23.880
Interesting.

03:43:23.880 --> 03:43:27.880
The only place I know of is an old house where they say witches used to live.

03:43:27.880 --> 03:43:29.880
You don't say, young man.

03:43:29.880 --> 03:43:33.880
Well, what do you know? What will he think of next?

03:43:46.880 --> 03:43:48.880
Her grandmother is...

03:43:48.880 --> 03:43:50.880
A witch, I think?

03:43:50.880 --> 03:43:52.880
But surely, they don't exist.

03:43:52.880 --> 03:43:56.880
Of course not, like dragons don't exist.

03:43:56.880 --> 03:43:58.880
Well, she doesn't seem like a nasty one.

03:43:58.880 --> 03:44:00.880
How can you tell, moment?

03:44:00.880 --> 03:44:04.880
I don't think that nice girl would have a bad one for a grandma.

03:44:04.880 --> 03:44:06.880
Perhaps not.

03:44:06.880 --> 03:44:10.880
So tell me what makes you think she's a witch, eh?

03:44:10.880 --> 03:44:13.880
Who else could live in that forest, Papa?

03:44:13.880 --> 03:44:16.880
I can't think of anyone right now, but some people would like it.

03:44:16.880 --> 03:44:18.880
Yes, I suppose you're right.

03:44:18.880 --> 03:44:20.880
I hope you are.

03:44:20.880 --> 03:44:24.880
I've lived in Moomin Valley for a long time and I've never once seen a witch.

03:44:24.880 --> 03:44:26.880
So they don't exist?

03:44:30.880 --> 03:44:31.880
Yes.

03:44:31.880 --> 03:44:33.880
Oh, stop working now, Snorke. Dinner's ready.

03:44:33.880 --> 03:44:35.880
Fine, coming.

03:44:39.880 --> 03:44:42.880
No wonder it's so light. Look, the moon is up.

03:44:42.880 --> 03:44:48.880
Snorke, Maiden, I think it would be very wise for you to stay with the Moomin's from tonight on.

03:44:48.880 --> 03:44:50.880
Why on earth do you think that's Snorke?

03:44:50.880 --> 03:44:53.880
I've decided not to hibernate this winter.

03:44:53.880 --> 03:44:55.880
Why ever not?

03:44:55.880 --> 03:44:59.880
I want to complete the blueprint for my new flying ship by next spring.

03:44:59.880 --> 03:45:03.880
For a real inventor, sleep is an unnecessary luxury.

03:45:03.880 --> 03:45:08.880
Science, my dear Snorke, Maiden, will not wait while inventors take a nap.

03:45:08.880 --> 03:45:12.880
But you know, dear Snorke, how dependent you are on your sleep.

03:45:12.880 --> 03:45:13.880
I'll stay with you.

03:45:13.880 --> 03:45:17.880
Very well, then, this winter I will hibernate with the Moomin's.

03:45:17.880 --> 03:45:22.880
Excellent. Shall we have dinner? I'm ready now.

03:45:31.880 --> 03:45:35.880
Most certainly, Snorke. Snorke Maiden will be just fine here with us.

03:45:35.880 --> 03:45:37.880
Thank you.

03:45:37.880 --> 03:45:41.880
This is nice for Moomin, too. Now he'll have Snorke Maiden to keep him company.

03:45:41.880 --> 03:45:42.880
Yes.

03:45:42.880 --> 03:45:45.880
But who needs company when they're hibernating?

03:45:45.880 --> 03:45:47.880
After all, Moomin will be fast asleep.

03:45:47.880 --> 03:45:51.880
Never the less. Sleeping is much nicer when someone else sleeps in the same room.

03:45:51.880 --> 03:45:54.880
When do we start hibernating, do you think?

03:45:54.880 --> 03:45:57.880
With weather like this in another few days, I guess.

03:45:57.880 --> 03:45:58.880
So early?

03:45:58.880 --> 03:46:00.880
We'll have snow before the week is out.

03:46:00.880 --> 03:46:02.880
Well, good luck with your new blueprint, Snorke.

03:46:02.880 --> 03:46:05.880
I look forward to seeing your flying ship in the spring.

03:46:05.880 --> 03:46:09.880
Hmm, come this time next year. I'll definitely be flying about.

03:46:13.880 --> 03:46:15.880
Thanks again for taking Snorke Maiden.

03:46:15.880 --> 03:46:18.880
It's not trouble at all. Good night, then.

03:46:18.880 --> 03:46:19.880
Good night, Snorke.

03:46:19.880 --> 03:46:21.880
See you, Snorke Maiden.

03:46:21.880 --> 03:46:23.880
Bye.

03:46:23.880 --> 03:46:26.880
Good luck this winter, Snorke.

03:46:31.880 --> 03:46:35.880
Thank goodness at last I can really concentrate on my work.

03:46:38.880 --> 03:46:40.880
Huh?

03:46:43.880 --> 03:46:46.880
I don't believe this.

03:46:50.880 --> 03:46:52.880
Am I hallucinating?

03:47:03.880 --> 03:47:05.880
Hello?

03:47:06.880 --> 03:47:08.880
Oh!

03:47:13.880 --> 03:47:19.880
Oh, which I'm sure it was. I'm positive. I'm a broomstick.

03:47:19.880 --> 03:47:22.880
And when the Snorke gets an idea in his head,

03:47:22.880 --> 03:47:25.880
it's not much room for anyone or anything else, is there?

03:47:25.880 --> 03:47:27.880
I hope you'll succeed this time.

03:47:27.880 --> 03:47:30.880
At least in my dream that rounding really flew well.

03:47:30.880 --> 03:47:34.880
I often dream that I fly, but I wouldn't dream of trying it out.

03:47:34.880 --> 03:47:37.880
Snorke must have had some sort of a new idea.

03:47:39.880 --> 03:47:41.880
It's Snorke.

03:47:43.880 --> 03:47:46.880
What's the matter?

03:47:56.880 --> 03:47:59.880
Oh, that's my piece of cake.

03:48:00.880 --> 03:48:02.880
You look like you've seen a ghost.

03:48:02.880 --> 03:48:05.880
Not a ghost. She laughed at me.

03:48:05.880 --> 03:48:08.880
Who did? She was flying on a broom.

03:48:08.880 --> 03:48:09.880
No engine at all.

03:48:09.880 --> 03:48:11.880
Are you talking about the witch?

03:48:11.880 --> 03:48:14.880
There's no point if you can do it so easily.

03:48:14.880 --> 03:48:16.880
Pull yourself together.

03:48:16.880 --> 03:48:17.880
You really swore?

03:48:17.880 --> 03:48:18.880
Yes.

03:48:18.880 --> 03:48:19.880
But where?

03:48:19.880 --> 03:48:21.880
Right near here.

03:48:27.880 --> 03:48:30.880
I can't see any witch up there, Snorke.

03:48:30.880 --> 03:48:32.880
Just the moon up in the sky.

03:48:42.880 --> 03:48:44.880
And she was really flying in the sky?

03:48:44.880 --> 03:48:46.880
Is that what Snorke said?

03:48:46.880 --> 03:48:49.880
Well, he should know about things that fly.

03:48:49.880 --> 03:48:52.880
But I just can't believe it until I've seen it myself.

03:48:52.880 --> 03:48:55.880
If she really is a witch, then what about the girl?

03:48:55.880 --> 03:48:58.880
I mean, no one could be happy living with a witch.

03:48:58.880 --> 03:49:01.880
I really don't know. I thought witches had to be old.

03:49:01.880 --> 03:49:05.880
Maybe it's not her real grandmother. She could be adopted.

03:49:05.880 --> 03:49:08.880
Well, moment, we must get to the bottom of this.

03:49:08.880 --> 03:49:10.880
Yes, Snuffkin. We must.

03:49:12.880 --> 03:49:13.880
Huh.

03:49:18.880 --> 03:49:21.880
Ha, I caught you at it again, you and your secret plan.

03:49:21.880 --> 03:49:23.880
Where are you going?

03:49:23.880 --> 03:49:25.880
Today you can't come with us with a little fly.

03:49:25.880 --> 03:49:26.880
And why not?

03:49:26.880 --> 03:49:28.880
Because we're going on a dangerous mission.

03:49:28.880 --> 03:49:30.880
We're going to the forest of witches.

03:49:30.880 --> 03:49:35.880
Well, if you're in any danger, then I must certainly come along to look after you, Moon.

03:49:35.880 --> 03:49:36.880
Come on.

03:49:38.880 --> 03:49:40.880
Besides, nothing's exciting to happen to me since I went up with that kite.

03:49:41.880 --> 03:49:43.880
This is so exciting.

03:49:43.880 --> 03:49:48.880
Ha, sleeping only through a set of four that I must cram in one adventure first.

03:49:48.880 --> 03:49:51.880
This is what we'll do. I grabbed the witch and while she's helpless,

03:49:51.880 --> 03:49:53.880
you two grab the girl and whisk her away to safety.

03:49:53.880 --> 03:49:57.880
That sounds great, but we don't know if she is a witch, little Mai.

03:49:57.880 --> 03:50:02.880
If we grab her and she isn't a witch, it would be embarrassing and we could all be in trouble.

03:50:02.880 --> 03:50:07.880
Maybe the witch needed an innocent maiden to try out some potions to experiment on her.

03:50:07.880 --> 03:50:09.880
Maybe, let's find out.

03:50:09.880 --> 03:50:10.880
How do we find out?

03:50:10.880 --> 03:50:12.880
By snooping around, I suppose.

03:50:12.880 --> 03:50:16.880
I hope you'll think of something a bit better than that before we get there.

03:50:16.880 --> 03:50:21.880
Let's hide as close to the house as we can and then ask the girl as soon as she comes out.

03:50:22.880 --> 03:50:25.880
And what if she doesn't come out, Snuffkin?

03:50:25.880 --> 03:50:27.880
Then we'll improvise, little Mai.

03:50:27.880 --> 03:50:30.880
So this is the famous plan by the great Snuffkin.

03:50:30.880 --> 03:50:35.880
Look, if she doesn't come out of the house, we'll just go up and knock on the door.

03:50:36.880 --> 03:50:41.880
Once we're inside, I'm sure we'll be able to tell what's really what.

03:50:41.880 --> 03:50:44.880
I don't think it's a very good idea.

03:50:44.880 --> 03:50:46.880
What if she catches us, Bell?

03:50:46.880 --> 03:50:50.880
Little Mai will wait outside and if we don't come out, she can run back to Moomin Valley for help.

03:50:50.880 --> 03:50:54.880
That's fine, but Moomin can wait outside and I'll search the house.

03:50:54.880 --> 03:50:58.880
Oh no, little Mai, you can wait outside and I will search the house.

03:50:58.880 --> 03:50:59.880
Let's do it this way.

03:50:59.880 --> 03:51:02.880
You stay outside and if we get caught, try to free us.

03:51:02.880 --> 03:51:06.880
And run for help as quickly as you can only if you can't.

03:51:06.880 --> 03:51:07.880
Is that okay?

03:51:07.880 --> 03:51:11.880
Hmm, that means if you're in trouble, your lives will be in my hands.

03:51:11.880 --> 03:51:12.880
That's right, little Mai.

03:51:12.880 --> 03:51:14.880
I don't like this out of this.

03:51:14.880 --> 03:51:17.880
I'm not sure I want little Mai to be my last hope.

03:51:17.880 --> 03:51:20.880
Well, I wouldn't now but anyone who doesn't trust me, that's for sure.

03:51:20.880 --> 03:51:21.880
Here's that?

03:51:21.880 --> 03:51:22.880
See what I mean?

03:51:22.880 --> 03:51:24.880
Be quiet.

03:51:25.880 --> 03:51:26.880
There's a house.

03:51:32.880 --> 03:51:33.880
Look at this.

03:51:33.880 --> 03:51:37.880
It's very quiet, do you think there's anybody home?

03:51:37.880 --> 03:51:39.880
I don't know, let's wait a while and see.

03:51:39.880 --> 03:51:42.880
Do we have to stay absolutely still?

03:51:42.880 --> 03:51:43.880
But of course we do.

03:51:43.880 --> 03:51:47.880
We'll feel extremely silly if the house is empty.

03:51:47.880 --> 03:51:49.880
They disappeared.

03:51:49.880 --> 03:51:51.880
They could have told us where they were going.

03:51:51.880 --> 03:51:52.880
I'm sure I don't care.

03:51:52.880 --> 03:51:54.880
Little Mai went too, I think.

03:51:54.880 --> 03:51:57.880
She's betrayed us, that's just like her.

03:51:57.880 --> 03:52:00.880
Don't worry, I've got a pretty good idea where they were heading for.

03:52:00.880 --> 03:52:02.880
You know where they've gone?

03:52:02.880 --> 03:52:04.880
Why didn't you tell me, where are they?

03:52:04.880 --> 03:52:07.880
They've gone to the forest of witches.

03:52:07.880 --> 03:52:08.880
What?

03:52:08.880 --> 03:52:11.880
They've gone to see whether the woman we met yesterday is a real witch.

03:52:11.880 --> 03:52:13.880
A real one?

03:52:13.880 --> 03:52:15.880
Why don't we go there too?

03:52:15.880 --> 03:52:18.880
I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find my way, Sniff.

03:52:18.880 --> 03:52:20.880
What is it?

03:52:20.880 --> 03:52:23.880
I don't know, it's my stomach, I better lie down.

03:52:23.880 --> 03:52:27.880
Oh, it's very painful.

03:52:28.880 --> 03:52:32.880
Oh, how much longer we can have to stay here like this.

03:52:32.880 --> 03:52:35.880
This adventure isn't the least bit exciting.

03:52:35.880 --> 03:52:37.880
Well, let's wait a little bit longer.

03:52:37.880 --> 03:52:40.880
Be quiet, at least we know the girl is definitely in there.

03:52:40.880 --> 03:52:43.880
No, we don't, she might be out, she could be anywhere.

03:52:43.880 --> 03:52:46.880
I know that's possible, but I don't think so.

03:52:51.880 --> 03:52:53.880
She's getting some water.

03:52:53.880 --> 03:52:56.880
As I thought, that bitch is working her to the bone.

03:52:56.880 --> 03:52:58.880
Hey, little boy.

03:52:58.880 --> 03:53:00.880
She's following that girl.

03:53:00.880 --> 03:53:03.880
You go with her, moving and find out as much as you possibly can about what's going on.

03:53:03.880 --> 03:53:05.880
I'll watch the house.

03:53:05.880 --> 03:53:07.880
Right.

03:53:08.880 --> 03:53:10.880
Hey, wait for me.

03:53:26.880 --> 03:53:29.880
Oh.

03:53:56.880 --> 03:53:59.880
Oh.

03:53:59.880 --> 03:54:04.880
If you're looking for Alicia, she's out.

03:54:29.880 --> 03:54:30.880
Oh, stop.

03:54:30.880 --> 03:54:31.880
Listen.

03:54:31.880 --> 03:54:33.880
Wait and see.

03:54:33.880 --> 03:54:35.880
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

03:54:35.880 --> 03:54:38.880
Why did you try to run away then?

03:54:43.880 --> 03:54:45.880
Oh, I'll help you with that.

03:54:45.880 --> 03:54:46.880
So will I.

03:54:46.880 --> 03:54:47.880
How kind of you.

03:54:47.880 --> 03:54:49.880
It is a bit heavy to carry, you know.

03:54:49.880 --> 03:54:51.880
I think I remember your name.

03:54:51.880 --> 03:54:52.880
Is it Alicia?

03:54:52.880 --> 03:54:53.880
Yes, it is.

03:54:53.880 --> 03:54:55.880
I'm so glad you remembered it.

03:54:55.880 --> 03:54:56.880
My name is Lulman.

03:54:56.880 --> 03:54:57.880
And I'm Lulman.

03:54:57.880 --> 03:55:00.880
What are you doing here in the forest of witches?

03:55:00.880 --> 03:55:04.880
Well, to be perfectly honest, we came because we were rather worried about you.

03:55:04.880 --> 03:55:06.880
What about me? Why is that?

03:55:06.880 --> 03:55:09.880
Is that a woman really your grandmother?

03:55:09.880 --> 03:55:10.880
Of course.

03:55:10.880 --> 03:55:11.880
You're quite sure?

03:55:11.880 --> 03:55:12.880
Yes, of course.

03:55:12.880 --> 03:55:14.880
She's my mother's mother.

03:55:14.880 --> 03:55:15.880
Why do you ask?

03:55:15.880 --> 03:55:17.880
Well, don't you know?

03:55:17.880 --> 03:55:18.880
He's trying to ask.

03:55:18.880 --> 03:55:19.880
That's cool.

03:55:19.880 --> 03:55:22.880
Well, maybe your grandmother is a witch.

03:55:22.880 --> 03:55:23.880
Yes, she is.

03:55:23.880 --> 03:55:24.880
Of course.

03:55:24.880 --> 03:55:26.880
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:55:26.880 --> 03:55:28.880
I was a bit taken aback.

03:55:28.880 --> 03:55:31.880
You don't mind about your grandmother being a real witch?

03:55:31.880 --> 03:55:32.880
Oh, no.

03:55:32.880 --> 03:55:33.880
That's what she is.

03:55:33.880 --> 03:55:34.880
I was husband.

03:55:34.880 --> 03:55:37.880
I'm going to be one, two, and I'm grown up.

03:55:37.880 --> 03:55:38.880
Oh, no.

03:55:38.880 --> 03:55:39.880
You couldn't.

03:55:39.880 --> 03:55:41.880
Well, you don't look anything like one.

03:55:41.880 --> 03:55:43.880
Well, that's because I'm not one yet.

03:55:43.880 --> 03:55:46.880
When you're born into a witch family, that's what you become.

03:55:46.880 --> 03:55:48.880
But it's not that easy, you know.

03:55:48.880 --> 03:55:50.880
Oh, this is too much.

03:55:50.880 --> 03:55:51.880
Now, tell me.

03:55:51.880 --> 03:55:54.880
What are you doing here in the forest of witches?

03:55:54.880 --> 03:55:56.880
You don't sound like a witch.

03:55:56.880 --> 03:55:57.880
Oh, really?

03:55:57.880 --> 03:55:59.880
What do witches sound like?

03:55:59.880 --> 03:56:02.880
Well, to be honest, you're the first one I've ever met in my whole life.

03:56:02.880 --> 03:56:05.880
I'm sure that's just what you think, young man.

03:56:05.880 --> 03:56:08.880
Is it true that the nice girl is really your granddaughter?

03:56:08.880 --> 03:56:09.880
Certainly.

03:56:09.880 --> 03:56:11.880
A very promising young girl.

03:56:11.880 --> 03:56:15.880
Honest and hardworking, and with a lot of training, she will make an excellent witch someday.

03:56:15.880 --> 03:56:18.880
But how can you possibly turn such a sweet girl into a witch?

03:56:18.880 --> 03:56:21.880
The sweetest girls make the best witches.

03:56:21.880 --> 03:56:23.880
Hello, didn't know you were back, grandma.

03:56:23.880 --> 03:56:25.880
Thank you for getting the water, Alicia.

03:56:25.880 --> 03:56:27.880
Oh, who's that?

03:56:27.880 --> 03:56:28.880
I don't know.

03:56:28.880 --> 03:56:32.880
Some naive young man ought to rescue a damsel in distress now.

03:56:32.880 --> 03:56:34.880
I remember you, your snuffkin.

03:56:34.880 --> 03:56:35.880
Yes.

03:56:38.880 --> 03:56:40.880
Your friend's snuffkins in here.

03:56:40.880 --> 03:56:41.880
Why don't you come in, too?

03:56:41.880 --> 03:56:42.880
In the house?

03:56:42.880 --> 03:56:43.880
Really?

03:56:43.880 --> 03:56:45.880
He's brought friends with him, hasn't he?

03:56:45.880 --> 03:56:47.880
Self-killed.

03:56:47.880 --> 03:56:49.880
Whatever they don't do to you.

03:56:49.880 --> 03:56:51.880
I'll take care of that.

03:56:51.880 --> 03:56:52.880
Wait a second.

03:56:52.880 --> 03:56:53.880
I'll do it for you.

03:56:53.880 --> 03:56:54.880
I'll fix it.

03:57:00.880 --> 03:57:01.880
Wait.

03:57:01.880 --> 03:57:02.880
I'm gonna need you again.

03:57:02.880 --> 03:57:03.880
Where are you going?

03:57:03.880 --> 03:57:06.880
I don't think that snake ever got bitten before.

03:57:06.880 --> 03:57:08.880
I'll get another.

03:57:08.880 --> 03:57:09.880
I'm very curious.

03:57:09.880 --> 03:57:11.880
Why are you free here, huh?

03:57:11.880 --> 03:57:15.880
They came all the way from Moomin Valley because they were really worried about me, grandma.

03:57:15.880 --> 03:57:17.880
Weren't about you?

03:57:17.880 --> 03:57:18.880
Yes.

03:57:18.880 --> 03:57:19.880
They thought you might be nasty to me.

03:57:19.880 --> 03:57:22.880
So they came all this way to see if I needed help.

03:57:22.880 --> 03:57:24.880
This always happens.

03:57:24.880 --> 03:57:29.880
People treat witches as if they weren't ordinary, respectable, responsible citizens.

03:57:29.880 --> 03:57:31.880
No, no, we're very sorry.

03:57:31.880 --> 03:57:32.880
We realize.

03:57:32.880 --> 03:57:37.880
She's quite okay, and she's most welcome to visit us in Moomin Valley at any time.

03:57:37.880 --> 03:57:38.880
Isn't she snuffkin?

03:57:38.880 --> 03:57:39.880
Yes, certainly.

03:57:40.880 --> 03:57:41.880
What?

03:57:41.880 --> 03:57:43.880
You said you'd visit these people?

03:57:43.880 --> 03:57:44.880
Oh, yes.

03:57:44.880 --> 03:57:48.880
I thought I'd go over there sometimes after I'd finished with my homework, of course.

03:57:48.880 --> 03:57:50.880
I would never leave my studies half done.

03:57:50.880 --> 03:57:57.880
Sorry, Alicia, but if you ever want to become a good witch, you mustn't see any ordinary mortals.

03:57:57.880 --> 03:57:58.880
Oh, why not?

03:57:58.880 --> 03:58:01.880
I've only just become friends with them, grandma, please.

03:58:01.880 --> 03:58:02.880
I know.

03:58:02.880 --> 03:58:06.880
Why don't I wait a year and study to be a witch next year?

03:58:06.880 --> 03:58:07.880
Alicia.

03:58:10.880 --> 03:58:12.880
This is family business.

03:58:12.880 --> 03:58:15.880
So if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you were to leave.

03:58:16.880 --> 03:58:19.880
I'd like you to go immediately if you please.

03:58:30.880 --> 03:58:32.880
It's snowing.

03:58:33.880 --> 03:58:39.880
Well, she certainly won't be able to visit us if Moomin Valley is buried in snow, so we might never see her again.

03:58:39.880 --> 03:58:41.880
No, that's right.

03:58:41.880 --> 03:58:44.880
And you'll be leaving soon, won't you, snuffkin?

03:58:45.880 --> 03:58:49.880
Winter had come once again to Moomin Valley.

03:59:01.880 --> 03:59:08.880
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

03:59:08.880 --> 03:59:15.880
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

03:59:15.880 --> 03:59:19.880
They're always happy and goes at play.

03:59:19.880 --> 03:59:23.880
The Moons are having fun day after day.

03:59:23.880 --> 03:59:26.880
The Moons.

03:59:26.880 --> 03:59:30.880
The Moons.

03:59:30.880 --> 03:59:36.880
The Moons.

03:59:38.880 --> 03:59:44.880
The Moons.

03:59:44.880 --> 03:59:49.880
The Moons.

03:59:49.880 --> 03:59:53.880
The Moons.

03:59:53.880 --> 03:59:56.880
The Moons.

03:59:56.880 --> 03:59:59.880
The Moons.

03:59:59.880 --> 04:00:02.880
Here they are for one and all.

04:00:02.880 --> 04:00:05.880
The Moons are about to call.

04:00:05.880 --> 04:00:08.480
I wanna sit down here with me

04:00:08.480 --> 04:00:11.080
Therefore you aren't your TV

04:00:11.080 --> 04:00:13.880
They are the movements

04:00:13.880 --> 04:00:16.880
They are the movements

04:00:16.880 --> 04:00:20.080
So come with me, give me your hand

04:00:20.080 --> 04:00:23.080
I'll take you up to a moment land

04:00:23.080 --> 04:00:25.880
You can fly just like a bird

04:00:25.880 --> 04:00:28.280
Sing the best song ever

04:00:28.280 --> 04:00:31.280
There were the movements

04:00:31.280 --> 04:00:34.280
There were the movements

04:00:34.280 --> 04:00:37.080
There were the movements

04:00:37.080 --> 04:00:40.080
There were the movements

04:00:40.080 --> 04:00:42.880
There were the movements

04:00:42.880 --> 04:00:49.880
There were the movements

04:00:49.880 --> 04:00:52.880
The snow was getting thicker on the ground

04:00:52.880 --> 04:00:58.880
and it was high time for the movements to start hibernating

04:01:04.280 --> 04:01:11.280
I'm so glad I've come to see you today instead of leaving a town

04:01:11.280 --> 04:01:15.280
I'm so glad I've come to see you today

04:01:15.280 --> 04:01:17.280
Instead of leaving a town

04:01:17.280 --> 04:01:19.280
What are you doing, my man?

04:01:19.280 --> 04:01:20.280
Alicia!

04:01:20.280 --> 04:01:22.280
What are you doing with these pine needles?

04:01:22.280 --> 04:01:24.280
That's what we always eat before we hibernate

04:01:24.280 --> 04:01:25.280
Nobody knows why

04:01:25.280 --> 04:01:27.280
So you're gonna start hibernating

04:01:27.280 --> 04:01:29.280
Yes tonight

04:01:29.280 --> 04:01:30.280
Oh, that's soon?

04:01:30.280 --> 04:01:31.280
Yes

04:01:31.280 --> 04:01:33.280
I'm so glad I've come to see you today

04:01:33.280 --> 04:01:37.280
Instead of leaving until tomorrow then

04:01:37.280 --> 04:01:40.280
I must say you came on just the right day, Alicia

04:01:40.280 --> 04:01:43.280
We usually have a small party the night we start hibernating

04:01:43.280 --> 04:01:45.280
and you've arrived just in time

04:01:45.280 --> 04:01:48.280
Oh, you mean I can stay for that woman, mama?

04:01:48.280 --> 04:01:51.280
And by the way, Alicia is a matter of interest

04:01:51.280 --> 04:01:53.280
It's the witch, sorry, your grandmother

04:01:53.280 --> 04:01:54.280
I mean, know that you're here?

04:01:54.280 --> 04:01:56.280
No, I'm afraid I didn't tell her

04:01:56.280 --> 04:01:58.280
Better for grownups not to know too much

04:01:58.280 --> 04:02:00.280
Oh, do you say you're right?

04:02:00.280 --> 04:02:03.280
I'm afraid she's not very happy for me to come here to Moomin Valley

04:02:03.280 --> 04:02:05.280
Oh, I have a lot my dear

04:02:05.280 --> 04:02:08.280
I guess she's afraid that if I start coming here to play

04:02:08.280 --> 04:02:11.280
I shall lose interest in studying hard at my witchcraft

04:02:11.280 --> 04:02:14.280
Oh, but you've got a very long time to go before you're a witch

04:02:14.280 --> 04:02:18.280
It takes anything between five to seven years nowadays

04:02:18.280 --> 04:02:21.280
Are you really sure that's what you want to be, Alicia?

04:02:21.280 --> 04:02:23.280
Study something out

04:02:23.280 --> 04:02:24.280
But I want to be a witch

04:02:24.280 --> 04:02:27.280
Perhaps you don't know, but witches aren't terribly popular

04:02:28.280 --> 04:02:30.280
Yes, I do, but I won't be like that

04:02:30.280 --> 04:02:31.280
I'll be popular

04:02:34.280 --> 04:02:36.280
Hey, Snuffkin!

04:02:39.280 --> 04:02:41.280
You're off to the moments?

04:02:41.280 --> 04:02:42.280
Yes

04:02:43.280 --> 04:02:45.280
I thought you'd gone south already

04:02:45.280 --> 04:02:48.280
Last winter you'd gone before the snow started

04:02:48.280 --> 04:02:50.280
Not this year, I promised Moomin

04:02:50.280 --> 04:02:51.280
Promise

04:02:51.280 --> 04:02:54.280
I promised not to leave Moomin Valley until he went into hibernation

04:02:58.280 --> 04:03:00.280
Everybody seems to be here

04:03:00.280 --> 04:03:02.280
And somebody knew

04:03:02.280 --> 04:03:03.280
Who's that?

04:03:03.280 --> 04:03:04.280
Half a guess

04:03:04.280 --> 04:03:05.280
Hmm

04:03:05.280 --> 04:03:08.280
Ah, very well then, it's Alicia, that's my guess

04:03:08.280 --> 04:03:10.280
Ah, how did you know?

04:03:10.280 --> 04:03:11.280
What?

04:03:11.280 --> 04:03:12.280
I'm right?

04:03:12.280 --> 04:03:15.280
Yes, you are, but I think you peaked and saw her earlier on

04:03:15.280 --> 04:03:18.280
I didn't, I just named somebody I thought couldn't be here

04:03:18.280 --> 04:03:19.280
Clever, huh?

04:03:19.280 --> 04:03:21.280
Well, she just happened to stop by

04:03:21.280 --> 04:03:22.280
She's with papa

04:03:22.280 --> 04:03:24.280
Who's showing her around the house

04:03:24.280 --> 04:03:26.280
Is the witch here, too?

04:03:26.280 --> 04:03:29.280
No, she didn't tell the witch she was coming here

04:03:29.280 --> 04:03:31.280
Just as well, thank goodness

04:03:34.280 --> 04:03:36.280
Ah, it's you, Snuffkin

04:03:36.280 --> 04:03:39.280
I finally came over, I told you I would

04:03:39.280 --> 04:03:40.280
Hi

04:03:40.280 --> 04:03:41.280
Remember our friend here?

04:03:41.280 --> 04:03:43.280
He's called Sniff

04:03:43.280 --> 04:03:45.280
Hi, how do you do Sniff?

04:03:45.280 --> 04:03:50.280
Well, you aren't gonna use your magic to cast any spells and stuff, are you?

04:03:50.280 --> 04:03:52.280
No

04:03:57.280 --> 04:04:01.280
Actually, they didn't need just pine needles for dinner that evening

04:04:01.280 --> 04:04:03.280
They had lots of other nice things, too

04:04:03.280 --> 04:04:05.280
All cooked by Mum and Mama

04:04:05.280 --> 04:04:08.280
Snuffkin, I'd like to say how story I am

04:04:08.280 --> 04:04:09.280
Why?

04:04:09.280 --> 04:04:13.280
I persuaded you to stay on here instead of going south as you'd planned

04:04:13.280 --> 04:04:14.280
I'm leaving tomorrow

04:04:14.280 --> 04:04:17.280
But the snow is quite deep

04:04:17.280 --> 04:04:19.280
Don't worry, I'm used to deep snow

04:04:19.280 --> 04:04:23.280
I'm just worried Alicia will find it hard to get home in this

04:04:23.280 --> 04:04:28.280
Well, she could spell the night here, but of course tomorrow will be asleep for the winter, so...

04:04:32.280 --> 04:04:33.280
Huh?

04:04:33.280 --> 04:04:35.280
Hmm, someone's at the door

04:04:35.280 --> 04:04:37.280
I'll see who it is

04:04:43.280 --> 04:04:45.280
Oh, hello, how are you?

04:04:47.280 --> 04:04:49.280
Hello indeed, my young man

04:04:49.280 --> 04:04:51.280
My granddaughter is here, isn't she?

04:04:52.280 --> 04:04:54.280
Who is it that moment?

04:04:54.280 --> 04:04:56.280
Oh, my dear

04:04:56.280 --> 04:04:58.280
You must be Mum and Papa

04:05:02.280 --> 04:05:04.280
Now, you listen to me, Mum and Papa

04:05:04.280 --> 04:05:08.280
I don't want my granddaughter playing with your children under any circumstances

04:05:08.280 --> 04:05:10.280
Do I make myself quite clear?

04:05:10.280 --> 04:05:12.280
But Alicia likes playing with us

04:05:12.280 --> 04:05:13.280
Grandma!

04:05:13.280 --> 04:05:14.280
We're leaving

04:05:14.280 --> 04:05:16.280
Can't I stay a little longer?

04:05:16.280 --> 04:05:19.280
Hello, you're most welcome to stay and have dinner with us

04:05:19.280 --> 04:05:21.280
Don't you know I'm a witch?

04:05:21.280 --> 04:05:23.280
I can't eat that sort of baby food

04:05:23.280 --> 04:05:25.280
Alicia quite likes the food

04:05:25.280 --> 04:05:28.280
The pine needles look okay, the rest is yucky

04:05:28.280 --> 04:05:29.280
Come, Alicia

04:05:29.280 --> 04:05:30.280
Please, let me stay, Grandma

04:05:30.280 --> 04:05:32.280
Certainly not, young lady

04:05:32.280 --> 04:05:35.280
I've told you before, which is never mixed with people like this

04:05:35.280 --> 04:05:37.280
And that goes for novice, which is as well

04:05:37.280 --> 04:05:38.280
Never

04:05:38.280 --> 04:05:40.280
But they're nice, they're really our Grandma

04:05:40.280 --> 04:05:42.280
And I told you, that's the trouble

04:05:42.280 --> 04:05:45.280
They are disgustingly, signally good

04:05:46.280 --> 04:05:49.280
You will hear a lot more about this when we get home

04:05:49.280 --> 04:05:51.280
Come on now

04:05:51.280 --> 04:05:55.280
It's really cold out here, and there's a lot more snow on the way

04:05:56.280 --> 04:05:58.280
All right, I'm coming, Grandma

04:05:58.280 --> 04:05:59.280
Coming

04:05:59.280 --> 04:06:00.280
Oh, thank you

04:06:00.280 --> 04:06:02.280
Mum and Papa

04:06:02.280 --> 04:06:03.280
Yeah

04:06:03.280 --> 04:06:05.280
We understand each other now, don't we?

04:06:05.280 --> 04:06:07.280
I'm sure you understand me

04:06:07.280 --> 04:06:08.280
Never mind about that

04:06:08.280 --> 04:06:12.280
You and your whole family are never to speak to my granddaughter again

04:06:12.280 --> 04:06:14.280
Is that understood?

04:06:14.280 --> 04:06:16.280
But Grandma

04:06:16.280 --> 04:06:19.280
Mind what I say over a vengeance of touch will come upon you

04:06:19.280 --> 04:06:21.280
Or even the revenge of a serious

04:06:21.280 --> 04:06:24.280
If you think cheap threats like that impress Mum and Papa

04:06:24.280 --> 04:06:26.280
You're making a grave mistake

04:06:26.280 --> 04:06:29.280
Mum and Papa is a highly educated gentleman

04:06:29.280 --> 04:06:32.280
But I am a witch with three diplomas

04:06:32.280 --> 04:06:33.280
Maybe so

04:06:33.280 --> 04:06:37.280
But tell me, how can three diplomas help you to get home with all this snow

04:06:37.280 --> 04:06:40.280
Ha, child's play to an accredited witch

04:06:40.280 --> 04:06:42.280
Come, Alicia

04:06:43.280 --> 04:06:47.280
I've never seen one of these before, a little pep square

04:06:47.280 --> 04:06:50.280
Is that really a witch's broom?

04:06:50.280 --> 04:06:51.280
Well, I never

04:06:51.280 --> 04:06:53.280
Let's go and see

04:06:53.280 --> 04:06:57.280
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

04:06:57.280 --> 04:06:58.280
I'm ready!

04:06:58.280 --> 04:06:59.280
Cold on died, Alicia

04:06:59.280 --> 04:07:02.280
Okay, can you both ride on that broom?

04:07:02.280 --> 04:07:06.280
It looks pretty scrappy to me, could fall to pieces, any minute

04:07:06.280 --> 04:07:09.280
Do drive slowly in this weather

04:07:09.280 --> 04:07:11.280
Oh, please don't fall off, Alicia

04:07:11.280 --> 04:07:13.280
But terrible chatterboxes you all are

04:07:13.280 --> 04:07:15.280
Please keep quiet all of you

04:07:16.280 --> 04:07:18.280
Are you ready, girl?

04:07:18.280 --> 04:07:19.280
Yeah

04:07:19.280 --> 04:07:21.280
Bet they'll never be able to take off

04:07:21.280 --> 04:07:22.280
Huh?

04:07:22.280 --> 04:07:29.280
Ahhh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

04:07:35.280 --> 04:07:37.280
This is nó!

04:07:37.280 --> 04:07:38.280
Oh, this is new at fall

04:07:38.280 --> 04:07:39.280
Come on!

04:07:45.640 --> 04:07:47.000
What is it, Grandma?

04:07:47.000 --> 04:07:48.000
Nothing!

04:07:48.000 --> 04:07:49.000
Oh!

04:07:49.840 --> 04:07:50.840
Ah!

04:07:52.120 --> 04:07:53.840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

04:07:53.840 --> 04:07:55.840
Just what I thought, they're too heavy!

04:07:56.840 --> 04:07:59.840
Listen, I could take Alicia's place, I'm not too heavy!

04:08:00.600 --> 04:08:03.000
Don't worry, I'm happy to walk home, Grandma!

04:08:03.000 --> 04:08:04.920
Don't be so ridiculous, child!

04:08:04.920 --> 04:08:06.840
You can't walk home in all this snow!

04:08:06.840 --> 04:08:07.720
You'll never make it!

04:08:07.720 --> 04:08:09.400
Only I had some skis!

04:08:09.400 --> 04:08:11.400
Come on, climb aboard!

04:08:11.400 --> 04:08:12.600
I'll try another spell!

04:08:13.640 --> 04:08:16.600
Grandma, are you worried because all those people are watching you?

04:08:16.600 --> 04:08:17.400
Shut up!

04:08:17.400 --> 04:08:19.000
And help me say the magic spell!

04:08:21.640 --> 04:08:22.440
Go ahead!

04:08:32.600 --> 04:08:33.800
They're doing it!

04:08:33.800 --> 04:08:34.600
They're doing it!

04:08:37.880 --> 04:08:39.440
Yeah, yeah!

04:08:46.840 --> 04:08:47.560
Oh.

04:08:49.480 --> 04:08:51.040
Where do we go?

04:08:58.320 --> 04:08:59.560
Oh!

04:09:01.800 --> 04:09:02.600
Hey!

04:09:02.600 --> 04:09:04.520
Where's the magic spell?

04:09:04.520 --> 04:09:06.200
You are in the water, good bye!

04:09:07.720 --> 04:09:10.220
Oh, stop it, Mama!

04:09:11.220 --> 04:09:14.720
She may have three diplomas, but I don't think she's very good, Mama.

04:09:14.720 --> 04:09:17.720
I wish they'd sing to the ground so I could fly that room.

04:09:17.720 --> 04:09:20.720
Guess they're all right now, Mum and Papa.

04:09:20.720 --> 04:09:22.720
Let's go back to our dinner.

04:09:30.720 --> 04:09:34.720
Oh, I forgot to thank them for asking me to stand at dinner.

04:09:34.720 --> 04:09:38.720
Thank them indeed. I don't think you're cut out to be a witch.

04:09:38.720 --> 04:09:40.720
Oh, but Grandma, I don't want to be one.

04:09:40.720 --> 04:09:44.720
Well, I'm quite happy to help, but the path will certainly be a difficult one.

04:09:44.720 --> 04:09:46.720
Oh? Oh.

04:09:46.720 --> 04:09:48.720
Mama!

04:10:05.720 --> 04:10:07.720
Oh.

04:10:21.720 --> 04:10:25.720
With Alessia and the witch gone home to the Valley of the Witches,

04:10:25.720 --> 04:10:30.720
Snuffkin departed for his trip south, and the Moomins went into hibernation.

04:10:34.720 --> 04:10:49.720
They certainly would have slept till the beginning of the spring, as usual, but this year.

04:10:57.720 --> 04:11:01.720
Quite unexpectedly, something happened.

04:11:04.720 --> 04:11:07.720
Go away, Master!

04:11:07.720 --> 04:11:10.720
Let's get out.

04:11:16.720 --> 04:11:19.720
Scums!

04:11:19.720 --> 04:11:23.720
Go away!

04:11:24.720 --> 04:11:26.720
Oh.

04:11:26.720 --> 04:11:28.720
G-

04:11:28.720 --> 04:11:30.720
Oh.

04:11:30.720 --> 04:11:32.720
Huh?

04:11:32.720 --> 04:11:57.720
There's someone at the window.

04:11:57.720 --> 04:12:01.720
There's someone at the window.

04:12:02.720 --> 04:12:11.720
It's frozen shut.

04:12:19.720 --> 04:12:22.720
Hey, why did you wake me up?

04:12:22.720 --> 04:12:24.720
Well, you shouldn't be asleep.

04:12:24.720 --> 04:12:26.720
Didn't you know Christmas is coming?

04:12:26.720 --> 04:12:29.720
It's tomorrow, so there's not a minute to be lost.

04:12:29.720 --> 04:12:31.720
Christmas is coming tomorrow.

04:12:31.720 --> 04:12:33.720
But who on earth is that?

04:12:33.720 --> 04:12:35.720
Why? Who is Christmas?

04:12:35.720 --> 04:12:37.720
This isn't a joke moment.

04:12:37.720 --> 04:12:39.720
I'm not in the least ready.

04:12:39.720 --> 04:12:41.720
I've lost my mittens and Christmas is coming

04:12:41.720 --> 04:12:43.720
and I haven't got a fir tree yet.

04:12:43.720 --> 04:12:46.720
A fir tree, I really must get a fir tree.

04:12:49.720 --> 04:12:50.720
How very odd.

04:12:50.720 --> 04:12:52.720
Why a fir tree?

04:12:52.720 --> 04:12:54.720
Hey!

04:12:54.720 --> 04:12:56.720
Why?

04:12:56.720 --> 04:12:58.720
Oh, what's that moment?

04:13:00.720 --> 04:13:04.720
Well, Christmas is almost coming and we don't have a fir tree yet.

04:13:04.720 --> 04:13:06.720
Christmas?

04:13:06.720 --> 04:13:07.720
Hmm.

04:13:07.720 --> 04:13:09.720
Did you say Christmas is coming?

04:13:09.720 --> 04:13:11.720
Yes, and before that, one must have a fir tree.

04:13:11.720 --> 04:13:13.720
What's this about a fir tree?

04:13:13.720 --> 04:13:17.720
Well, you need one to protect ourselves against this Christmas person, Mumma.

04:13:17.720 --> 04:13:20.720
I'm not really quite clear on that point.

04:13:20.720 --> 04:13:23.720
But there's something awful that has to be kept away, right?

04:13:24.720 --> 04:13:26.720
Ah, keep it up.

04:13:26.720 --> 04:13:28.720
I better go get a fir tree.

04:13:42.720 --> 04:13:45.720
Ha, about the time you move in, Scotta.

04:13:45.720 --> 04:13:47.720
How are you going to see?

04:13:47.720 --> 04:13:49.720
Pretty good fir tree, Dad.

04:13:50.720 --> 04:13:52.720
Well, thank you, Gavsie.

04:13:52.720 --> 04:13:54.720
But could you tell me something?

04:13:54.720 --> 04:13:56.720
What is one supposed to do with it?

04:13:58.720 --> 04:14:00.720
I'm really moving, Papa.

04:14:00.720 --> 04:14:03.720
The way you can joke with such a straight face.

04:14:03.720 --> 04:14:04.720
Joke?

04:14:04.720 --> 04:14:05.720
Eh?

04:14:05.720 --> 04:14:09.720
Love to stay, but I haven't even finished cooking yet.

04:14:12.720 --> 04:14:13.720
I wasn't joking.

04:14:13.720 --> 04:14:15.720
No one believe me, either.

04:14:20.720 --> 04:14:23.720
Would you like a little more, young man?

04:14:23.720 --> 04:14:24.720
No, thank you very much.

04:14:24.720 --> 04:14:26.720
I'm really nice and warm again now.

04:14:26.720 --> 04:14:30.720
I saw a moment, Papa, and a moment bring up a big tree.

04:14:30.720 --> 04:14:32.720
But what is one supposed to do with it?

04:14:32.720 --> 04:14:33.720
Don't you know?

04:14:33.720 --> 04:14:35.720
No.

04:14:35.720 --> 04:14:38.720
Why, you decorate it as beautifully as you can.

04:14:38.720 --> 04:14:39.720
Really?

04:14:43.720 --> 04:14:46.720
Christmas is coming, so I better be off.

04:14:46.720 --> 04:14:48.720
Everyone's talking of Christmas.

04:14:48.720 --> 04:14:49.720
I know.

04:14:49.720 --> 04:14:51.720
I've got a long way to go.

04:14:53.720 --> 04:14:55.720
Take care, dear.

04:15:01.720 --> 04:15:02.720
Hello.

04:15:02.720 --> 04:15:03.720
Hello.

04:15:06.720 --> 04:15:08.720
Bye-bye!

04:15:08.720 --> 04:15:09.720
Bye-bye!

04:15:09.720 --> 04:15:11.720
Goodbye.

04:15:12.720 --> 04:15:13.720
Who was that?

04:15:13.720 --> 04:15:14.720
I don't know.

04:15:14.720 --> 04:15:17.720
He was in a hurry to get somewhere before Christmas.

04:15:17.720 --> 04:15:19.720
Oh, I gave him some tea.

04:15:19.720 --> 04:15:20.720
That was nice.

04:15:20.720 --> 04:15:23.720
And he told us what to do with the fir tree.

04:15:23.720 --> 04:15:24.720
What did he say?

04:15:24.720 --> 04:15:26.720
To decorate it beautifully.

04:15:26.720 --> 04:15:29.720
Decorate it, but why should we do that, Mama?

04:15:29.720 --> 04:15:33.720
I guess we must decorate the tree to make sure we keep Christmas happy.

04:15:33.720 --> 04:15:34.720
Yes, you're right.

04:15:34.720 --> 04:15:36.720
We'd better start doing it right away.

04:15:36.720 --> 04:15:39.720
Yes, I'm sure there's not a moment to lose.

04:15:39.720 --> 04:15:40.720
No.

04:15:40.720 --> 04:15:41.720
Mama?

04:15:41.720 --> 04:15:42.720
Yes, dear.

04:15:42.720 --> 04:15:45.720
They also say we have to cook lots of food for Christmas.

04:15:45.720 --> 04:15:46.720
Goodness.

04:15:46.720 --> 04:15:48.720
Well, at least he won't be eating us then.

04:15:57.720 --> 04:15:58.720
Here.

04:15:58.720 --> 04:16:00.720
And thank you, Snorkmaid.

04:16:00.720 --> 04:16:04.720
Oh, the ship means rather a rock to me.

04:16:04.720 --> 04:16:06.720
It will look fantastic on the tree, Papa.

04:16:06.720 --> 04:16:07.720
Yes, dear.

04:16:07.720 --> 04:16:08.720
I suppose you're right.

04:16:09.720 --> 04:16:15.720
Oh, why don't we put this at the top?

04:16:15.720 --> 04:16:17.720
This is Mars.

04:16:17.720 --> 04:16:20.720
Don't worry.

04:16:20.720 --> 04:16:24.720
Mmm, that looks beautiful.

04:16:24.720 --> 04:16:27.720
Listen, everybody.

04:16:27.720 --> 04:16:31.720
I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas, too.

04:16:31.720 --> 04:16:32.720
Really?

04:16:33.720 --> 04:16:37.720
I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas, too.

04:16:37.720 --> 04:16:39.720
Really, Mama?

04:16:39.720 --> 04:16:42.720
I don't wonder what this Christmas will be like.

04:16:42.720 --> 04:16:46.720
What if it's an awful greedy, beastly monster like the grove?

04:16:46.720 --> 04:16:47.720
Don't worry, Snorkmaid.

04:16:47.720 --> 04:16:50.720
We'll give him lots of presents and stuff him full of food.

04:16:55.720 --> 04:16:58.720
Have you thought of any presents for Christmas yet?

04:16:58.720 --> 04:17:00.720
I don't know what to give him.

04:17:00.720 --> 04:17:02.720
Look, a seashell.

04:17:02.720 --> 04:17:04.720
Oh, that's a beauty.

04:17:07.720 --> 04:17:10.720
Oh, look, Mama, what I got for Christmas.

04:17:10.720 --> 04:17:13.720
I'm going to give him a pretty lure for fishing.

04:17:13.720 --> 04:17:15.720
I'm giving him this book.

04:17:15.720 --> 04:17:16.720
Great presents.

04:17:16.720 --> 04:17:20.720
I'm sure he'll be very happy with the moment family and not Thomas at all.

04:17:31.720 --> 04:17:33.720
I think Christmas will come any moment now.

04:17:33.720 --> 04:17:35.720
So do I.

04:17:35.720 --> 04:17:36.720
Oh, dear.

04:17:36.720 --> 04:17:39.720
I do hope he likes my pumpkin pie.

04:17:39.720 --> 04:17:40.720
He will.

04:17:40.720 --> 04:17:43.720
Imagine everyone in Moomin Valley being frightened.

04:17:43.720 --> 04:17:44.720
Mmm.

04:17:54.720 --> 04:17:55.720
Are you sleepy?

04:17:55.720 --> 04:17:56.720
Yes, I am.

04:17:56.720 --> 04:17:59.720
I can't stay this scared for much longer.

04:18:00.720 --> 04:18:03.720
Better come before all the food freezes.

04:18:03.720 --> 04:18:04.720
Oh.

04:18:07.720 --> 04:18:08.720
He's coming.

04:18:11.720 --> 04:18:15.720
I never thought Christmas could be that small.

04:18:15.720 --> 04:18:17.720
Merry Christmas.

04:18:17.720 --> 04:18:20.720
Merry Christmas. Is that what he is?

04:18:20.720 --> 04:18:22.720
Well, it's just what you say.

04:18:22.720 --> 04:18:26.720
All of my life I have dreamed of seeing all this up close, honestly.

04:18:27.720 --> 04:18:30.720
I never really thought a Christmas tree could be this beautiful.

04:18:30.720 --> 04:18:32.720
Brought my friends, too.

04:18:32.720 --> 04:18:34.720
You're all very welcome.

04:18:34.720 --> 04:18:36.720
Oh, thank you.

04:18:36.720 --> 04:18:37.720
Hear that, everybody?

04:18:37.720 --> 04:18:39.720
We're all very welcome.

04:18:39.720 --> 04:18:40.720
Woo!

04:18:40.720 --> 04:18:41.720
Man, let's get him.

04:18:41.720 --> 04:18:43.720
There's some wonderful things here.

04:18:43.720 --> 04:18:44.720
Yeah!

04:18:46.720 --> 04:18:48.720
Oh, what a lot of food you've made.

04:18:48.720 --> 04:18:51.720
Yes, all the food there is for Christmas.

04:18:51.720 --> 04:18:53.720
And are those real presents?

04:18:53.720 --> 04:18:55.720
They are.

04:18:55.720 --> 04:18:59.720
All of my life, I've sort of wondered about those things called presents.

04:18:59.720 --> 04:19:02.720
Papa, I don't think these creatures are Christmas.

04:19:02.720 --> 04:19:04.720
Neither do I.

04:19:12.720 --> 04:19:14.720
You look sleepy.

04:19:14.720 --> 04:19:15.720
I am.

04:19:15.720 --> 04:19:18.720
Must be well past midnight.

04:19:18.720 --> 04:19:21.720
What is Christmas doing, Mama?

04:19:21.720 --> 04:19:23.720
Aren't you sleepy, too, little ones?

04:19:23.720 --> 04:19:27.720
Sleepy with a wonderful Christmas tree like this to look at.

04:19:30.720 --> 04:19:31.720
Hey, Papa.

04:19:31.720 --> 04:19:32.720
What is it?

04:19:32.720 --> 04:19:35.720
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

04:19:35.720 --> 04:19:36.720
Maybe.

04:19:38.720 --> 04:19:41.720
Nobody can get really angry this late at night.

04:19:41.720 --> 04:19:45.720
Surely we'll close the doors and perhaps we'll be safe inside.

04:19:45.720 --> 04:19:47.720
I'm sure you're right.

04:19:47.720 --> 04:19:48.720
Listen, my friends.

04:19:48.720 --> 04:19:51.720
We'd like to give you the tree and the food and the presents.

04:19:52.720 --> 04:19:53.720
What?

04:19:53.720 --> 04:19:54.720
All of this?

04:19:54.720 --> 04:19:55.720
For us?

04:19:55.720 --> 04:19:57.720
Yes, we want to sleep.

04:19:57.720 --> 04:19:59.720
We're far more sleepy than scared.

04:20:03.720 --> 04:20:04.720
Snortman?

04:20:04.720 --> 04:20:06.720
Oh, I see here yet.

04:20:06.720 --> 04:20:09.720
No, but we decided to go back to hibernating.

04:20:10.720 --> 04:20:11.720
Bye-bye.

04:20:28.720 --> 04:20:31.720
I thought Christmas tree should have a star on top.

04:20:31.720 --> 04:20:34.720
I don't think it makes any difference, you know?

04:20:34.720 --> 04:20:37.720
A nice rose is just as good as a star.

04:20:37.720 --> 04:20:38.720
Look at that!

04:21:01.720 --> 04:21:04.720
And apparently it didn't make any difference at all.

04:21:04.720 --> 04:21:07.720
Because the Moonman family slept as peacefully as ever,

04:21:07.720 --> 04:21:13.720
all through the night, without Christmas, coming anywhere near them.

04:21:13.720 --> 04:21:16.720
So probably he went someplace else.

04:21:18.720 --> 04:21:25.720
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

04:21:25.720 --> 04:21:33.720
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:21:33.720 --> 04:21:36.720
They're always happy and goes at play.

04:21:36.720 --> 04:21:40.720
The Moons are having fun day after day.

04:21:40.720 --> 04:21:43.720
The Moons.

04:21:43.720 --> 04:21:46.720
The Moons.

04:21:46.720 --> 04:21:48.720
The Moons.

04:21:48.720 --> 04:21:51.720
The Moons.

04:22:03.720 --> 04:22:06.720
The Moons.

04:22:34.720 --> 04:22:37.720
So come with me, give me your hand.

04:22:37.720 --> 04:22:40.720
I'll take you up to a moment land.

04:22:40.720 --> 04:22:43.720
You can fly just like a bird.

04:22:43.720 --> 04:22:45.720
Sing that song ever.

04:22:45.720 --> 04:22:48.720
There were the movements.

04:22:48.720 --> 04:22:51.720
There were the movements.

04:22:51.720 --> 04:22:54.720
There were the movements.

04:22:54.720 --> 04:22:57.720
There were the movements.

04:22:57.720 --> 04:23:00.720
There were the movements.

04:23:00.720 --> 04:23:03.720
There were the movements.

04:23:03.720 --> 04:23:06.720
There were the movements.

04:23:21.720 --> 04:23:23.720
During his long winter sleep,

04:23:23.720 --> 04:23:26.720
Moonman had a dream.

04:23:30.720 --> 04:23:34.720
And strangely enough, he dreamt that he was sleeping.

04:23:34.720 --> 04:23:36.720
Moonman.

04:23:36.720 --> 04:23:38.720
Moonman.

04:23:38.720 --> 04:23:41.720
Huh?

04:23:44.720 --> 04:23:46.720
Alicia.

04:23:46.720 --> 04:23:47.720
Alicia.

04:23:47.720 --> 04:23:50.720
Wow, you can fly on the broomstick now.

04:23:50.720 --> 04:23:53.720
Right, I'm a fully fledged witch now, Moonman.

04:23:53.720 --> 04:23:56.720
Wait, give me a ride, Alicia.

04:23:56.720 --> 04:23:57.720
Can't do that.

04:23:57.720 --> 04:23:59.720
Oh, don't be mean, Alicia.

04:23:59.720 --> 04:24:02.720
Because someone's already riding with me.

04:24:02.720 --> 04:24:04.720
Man, it's me.

04:24:04.720 --> 04:24:05.720
Little boy.

04:24:05.720 --> 04:24:08.720
Would you mind if we went a little higher, Alicia?

04:24:08.720 --> 04:24:10.720
Sure.

04:24:10.720 --> 04:24:12.720
Oh, wow, higher, Alicia.

04:24:12.720 --> 04:24:14.720
Keep going.

04:24:16.720 --> 04:24:18.720
Please, listen.

04:24:18.720 --> 04:24:19.720
Come back.

04:24:19.720 --> 04:24:21.720
Please, give me a ride, Alicia.

04:24:21.720 --> 04:24:23.720
Here you go.

04:24:35.720 --> 04:24:39.720
Oh, thank you, Moonman.

04:24:39.720 --> 04:24:42.720
Will you give me a ride now?

04:24:42.720 --> 04:24:44.720
Come on now.

04:24:49.720 --> 04:24:51.720
Moonman.

04:24:59.720 --> 04:25:02.720
Moonman, Val, he's really beautiful from up here.

04:25:02.720 --> 04:25:05.720
Yes, lovely.

04:25:05.720 --> 04:25:07.720
Oh, Alicia, be careful.

04:25:07.720 --> 04:25:08.720
Don't do things like that.

04:25:08.720 --> 04:25:09.720
What are you talking about?

04:25:09.720 --> 04:25:11.720
We're not doing anything, Moonman.

04:25:11.720 --> 04:25:13.720
A little boy, it's you again.

04:25:13.720 --> 04:25:16.720
No wonder the broom is shaking so much.

04:25:16.720 --> 04:25:17.720
How do you like it?

04:25:17.720 --> 04:25:19.720
I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?

04:25:19.720 --> 04:25:22.720
Where did you get this broom from, little boy?

04:25:22.720 --> 04:25:24.720
I borrowed it from the witch.

04:25:24.720 --> 04:25:25.720
I borrowed it.

04:25:25.720 --> 04:25:26.720
For a while.

04:25:26.720 --> 04:25:28.720
That's the witch, isn't it?

04:25:28.720 --> 04:25:29.720
Looks like it.

04:25:29.720 --> 04:25:31.720
Maybe we better get out of here.

04:25:31.720 --> 04:25:32.720
You're right.

04:25:32.720 --> 04:25:33.720
Stop.

04:25:33.720 --> 04:25:34.720
You two little thieves.

04:25:34.720 --> 04:25:36.720
Give me back my broom at once.

04:25:36.720 --> 04:25:37.720
No.

04:25:37.720 --> 04:25:38.720
Yeah.

04:25:38.720 --> 04:25:39.720
You have your own broom.

04:25:39.720 --> 04:25:41.720
You witches should learn how to share.

04:25:41.720 --> 04:25:43.720
But there's no one who's just a spare.

04:25:43.720 --> 04:25:45.720
I want my veil from back right now.

04:25:45.720 --> 04:25:46.720
Find yours, keepers.

04:25:46.720 --> 04:25:47.720
It's my broom.

04:25:47.720 --> 04:25:48.720
Cut that a broom.

04:25:48.720 --> 04:25:49.720
Huh.

04:25:49.720 --> 04:25:51.720
Why don't you take a closer look at it?

04:25:51.720 --> 04:25:52.720
That's not a broom.

04:25:52.720 --> 04:25:53.720
What do you mean?

04:25:53.720 --> 04:25:54.720
This is not a broom.

04:25:54.720 --> 04:25:55.720
Oh.

04:25:55.720 --> 04:25:56.720
Oh.

04:25:56.720 --> 04:25:57.720
Hey.

04:25:57.720 --> 04:25:58.720
Oh.

04:25:58.720 --> 04:25:59.720
Oh.

04:25:59.720 --> 04:26:00.720
Oh.

04:26:00.720 --> 04:26:01.720
Oh.

04:26:01.720 --> 04:26:02.720
Oh.

04:26:02.720 --> 04:26:03.720
Oh.

04:26:03.720 --> 04:26:04.720
Oh.

04:26:04.720 --> 04:26:05.720
Oh.

04:26:05.720 --> 04:26:06.720
Oh.

04:26:06.720 --> 04:26:07.720
Oh.

04:26:07.720 --> 04:26:08.720
Oh.

04:26:08.720 --> 04:26:09.720
Oh.

04:26:09.720 --> 04:26:10.720
Oh.

04:26:10.720 --> 04:26:11.720
Oh.

04:26:11.720 --> 04:26:12.720
Oh.

04:26:12.720 --> 04:26:13.720
Oh.

04:26:13.720 --> 04:26:14.720
Oh.

04:26:14.720 --> 04:26:15.720
I must have been dreaming.

04:26:15.720 --> 04:26:17.720
You were yelling out loud.

04:26:17.720 --> 04:26:18.720
Oh.

04:26:18.720 --> 04:26:19.720
I'm so sorry.

04:26:19.720 --> 04:26:23.720
I didn't mean to wake you up, Snorkman.

04:26:23.720 --> 04:26:33.720
Can you see anything?

04:26:33.720 --> 04:26:34.720
Only snow.

04:26:34.720 --> 04:26:35.720
Everything's so light.

04:26:35.720 --> 04:26:36.720
Yes.

04:26:36.720 --> 04:26:37.720
The morning's up.

04:26:37.720 --> 04:26:38.720
Oh.

04:26:38.720 --> 04:26:39.720
What an airy light.

04:26:39.720 --> 04:26:40.720
Yes.

04:26:40.720 --> 04:26:41.720
Spring hasn't arrived yet.

04:26:41.720 --> 04:26:42.720
Has it?

04:26:42.720 --> 04:26:43.720
Yes.

04:26:43.720 --> 04:26:45.720
Everybody else is still asleep then?

04:26:45.720 --> 04:26:46.720
Yes.

04:26:46.720 --> 04:26:47.720
Most of them anyway.

04:26:47.720 --> 04:26:49.720
Wonder if my brother's still up.

04:26:49.720 --> 04:26:54.800
Well, he did say before we started hyprinating, he wanted to finish his blueprints before spring

04:26:54.800 --> 04:26:55.800
if he could.

04:26:55.800 --> 04:26:57.720
I hope he'll succeed this time.

04:26:57.720 --> 04:26:58.720
When he go out.

04:26:58.720 --> 04:26:59.720
Huh?

04:26:59.720 --> 04:27:02.720
Outside just to see what the snow looks like.

04:27:02.720 --> 04:27:03.720
Oh, no.

04:27:03.720 --> 04:27:06.720
I don't really feel like it.

04:27:06.720 --> 04:27:07.720
It's nice and warm here.

04:27:07.720 --> 04:27:11.720
Why don't we sleep till spring like the others?

04:27:11.720 --> 04:27:15.720
Spring is still a long way off.

04:27:15.720 --> 04:27:17.720
I guess you're right.

04:27:17.720 --> 04:27:20.720
It is nice and warm in here.

04:27:34.720 --> 04:27:36.720
It's delicious.

04:27:36.720 --> 04:27:39.720
Chocolate cakes, my favorite.

04:27:40.720 --> 04:27:42.720
Did you say something, snorkeweider?

04:27:42.720 --> 04:27:45.720
I'm so very hungry, moment.

04:27:51.720 --> 04:27:54.720
Your mother's raspberry juice is really the best.

04:27:54.720 --> 04:27:55.720
It is, isn't it?

04:27:55.720 --> 04:27:57.720
Everybody said that last winter, too.

04:27:57.720 --> 04:27:58.720
Hey, moment.

04:27:58.720 --> 04:27:59.720
Yeah?

04:27:59.720 --> 04:28:00.720
I have a funny feeling.

04:28:00.720 --> 04:28:02.720
Someone is watching us and I don't like you.

04:28:02.720 --> 04:28:03.720
One little bit.

04:28:03.720 --> 04:28:05.720
Moment, Papa, could explain it.

04:28:05.720 --> 04:28:06.720
I'm sure.

04:28:06.720 --> 04:28:07.720
Of course, someone's watching.

04:28:07.720 --> 04:28:08.720
What?

04:28:08.720 --> 04:28:09.720
But who?

04:28:09.720 --> 04:28:10.720
And how do you know?

04:28:10.720 --> 04:28:11.720
Too thick.

04:28:11.720 --> 04:28:13.720
He told me all about it last winter, snort maiden.

04:28:13.720 --> 04:28:15.720
She doesn't hibernate, you know?

04:28:15.720 --> 04:28:18.720
She lives in our bathhouse and watches over us in the winter.

04:28:18.720 --> 04:28:22.720
She said that many things are too shy to show themselves.

04:28:22.720 --> 04:28:24.720
Oh, have you seen them yourself?

04:28:24.720 --> 04:28:25.720
Sort of.

04:28:25.720 --> 04:28:27.720
Except they were invisible, of course.

04:28:27.720 --> 04:28:29.720
Like under the sink.

04:28:29.720 --> 04:28:31.720
Or in the clock, maybe.

04:28:31.720 --> 04:28:35.720
In the empty fireplace and other dark corners of the room.

04:28:36.720 --> 04:28:39.720
Did you actually look anywhere for them?

04:28:39.720 --> 04:28:40.720
Oh, no.

04:28:40.720 --> 04:28:41.720
They'd be very upset.

04:28:41.720 --> 04:28:44.720
It's better not to let them know we know where they are.

04:28:44.720 --> 04:28:46.720
I wonder what these things look like.

04:28:46.720 --> 04:28:48.720
Some of them look very much like us, too, Tiki said.

04:28:48.720 --> 04:28:51.720
Old ancestors of ours from way back, she thinks.

04:28:51.720 --> 04:28:53.720
Some of them look like us, she said.

04:28:53.720 --> 04:28:55.720
Well, I've never seen them for myself.

04:28:55.720 --> 04:28:58.720
I wonder if there is good looking as we are.

04:28:58.720 --> 04:29:07.720
Wouldn't it be a good idea to stay up and wait for the sunrise?

04:29:07.720 --> 04:29:09.720
A great idea.

04:29:14.720 --> 04:29:16.720
Now, don't say anything to scare them.

04:29:16.720 --> 04:29:20.720
But this is one of the movement's ancestors from way back.

04:29:22.720 --> 04:29:24.720
Is it morning already?

04:29:24.720 --> 04:29:25.720
Are you sure?

04:29:25.720 --> 04:29:26.720
I think so.

04:29:26.720 --> 04:29:29.720
There are no clouds, so why can't we see the sun?

04:29:29.720 --> 04:29:33.720
I guess maybe the sun doesn't come up at all this time of the year.

04:29:33.720 --> 04:29:35.720
Mom and I don't like this.

04:29:35.720 --> 04:29:38.720
I don't like you one little bit.

04:29:38.720 --> 04:29:40.720
You silly little girl.

04:29:40.720 --> 04:29:41.720
What do you need this for?

04:29:41.720 --> 04:29:42.720
Please, grandma.

04:29:42.720 --> 04:29:43.720
I won't be long.

04:29:43.720 --> 04:29:44.720
I promise.

04:29:44.720 --> 04:29:45.720
What are you talking about?

04:29:45.720 --> 04:29:47.720
Is if you could fly a broom.

04:29:47.720 --> 04:29:49.720
Get back back to me at once.

04:29:49.720 --> 04:29:51.720
No, I won't give it back.

04:29:51.720 --> 04:29:52.720
Now give me back that broom.

04:29:52.720 --> 04:29:53.720
And don't be silly.

04:29:53.720 --> 04:29:56.720
How many times from sight tell you you can't go visiting Moomin Valley.

04:29:56.720 --> 04:29:58.720
But it's so boring here.

04:29:58.720 --> 04:30:00.720
I want some company, grandma.

04:30:00.720 --> 04:30:03.720
Come on, broom fly off.

04:30:03.720 --> 04:30:05.720
Take me to Moomin Valley.

04:30:08.720 --> 04:30:11.720
Help me up, grandma.

04:30:11.720 --> 04:30:12.720
Please.

04:30:14.720 --> 04:30:15.720
All right, my girl.

04:30:15.720 --> 04:30:17.720
I'll help you up, shall I?

04:30:17.720 --> 04:30:23.720
I don't believe it.

04:30:23.720 --> 04:30:24.720
I'm floating.

04:30:24.720 --> 04:30:25.720
Oh.

04:30:25.720 --> 04:30:26.720
How far?

04:30:26.720 --> 04:30:27.720
This is great.

04:30:27.720 --> 04:30:28.720
Wait.

04:30:28.720 --> 04:30:29.720
Oh.

04:30:29.720 --> 04:30:30.720
I'm falling.

04:30:30.720 --> 04:30:31.720
Oh.

04:30:31.720 --> 04:30:32.720
Oh.

04:30:32.720 --> 04:30:33.720
Oh.

04:30:33.720 --> 04:30:34.720
How about that of these?

04:30:34.720 --> 04:30:36.720
I don't find them far around here.

04:30:36.720 --> 04:30:37.720
Oh.

04:30:37.720 --> 04:30:39.720
Oh, don't bury things again.

04:30:39.720 --> 04:30:40.720
How about this?

04:30:40.720 --> 04:30:42.720
I don't find them far around here.

04:30:42.720 --> 04:30:43.720
Oh.

04:30:43.720 --> 04:30:45.720
Oh, don't bury things again.

04:30:45.720 --> 04:30:47.720
How about this?

04:30:47.720 --> 04:30:48.720
Oh, no.

04:30:48.720 --> 04:30:49.720
Stop the broom, grandma.

04:30:49.720 --> 04:30:50.720
Please.

04:30:50.720 --> 04:30:51.720
Oh.

04:30:51.720 --> 04:30:52.720
Come on.

04:30:52.720 --> 04:30:54.720
You wanted to ride on the broom, didn't you?

04:30:54.720 --> 04:30:55.720
You first saw the bike.

04:30:55.720 --> 04:30:56.720
Well, here it is.

04:30:56.720 --> 04:30:57.720
Oh.

04:30:57.720 --> 04:30:59.720
Oh.

04:30:59.720 --> 04:31:00.720
Oh, mom.

04:31:00.720 --> 04:31:02.720
Please, don't.

04:31:02.720 --> 04:31:03.720
Oh.

04:31:06.720 --> 04:31:10.720
If you want to learn to fly on this broom, Alicia,

04:31:10.720 --> 04:31:14.720
then forget all about those dreaded movements and really start studying.

04:31:14.720 --> 04:31:16.720
It's hard work, you know, young woman.

04:31:16.720 --> 04:31:18.720
You must learn concentrate.

04:31:24.720 --> 04:31:25.720
Hey, you up there.

04:31:25.720 --> 04:31:27.720
Are you making fun of me, too?

04:31:33.720 --> 04:31:35.720
Oh, I can't climb down there.

04:31:35.720 --> 04:31:36.720
Of course you can.

04:31:36.720 --> 04:31:40.720
Even if you fall, you can't hurt yourself on this soft snow.

04:31:40.720 --> 04:31:42.720
Don't shake the ladder, Moment.

04:31:42.720 --> 04:31:43.720
This is scary.

04:31:43.720 --> 04:31:45.720
Slowly does it.

04:31:45.720 --> 04:31:47.720
Take it easy and don't look down.

04:31:47.720 --> 04:31:50.720
Maybe going out wasn't such a good idea after all.

04:31:50.720 --> 04:31:53.720
We can always change our minds and go back to sleep, you know.

04:31:53.720 --> 04:31:55.720
See, you've made it.

04:31:55.720 --> 04:31:59.720
It's very cold out here, woman, but I rather like it.

04:31:59.720 --> 04:32:00.720
Oh.

04:32:00.720 --> 04:32:04.720
This is the roof over the front door, isn't it?

04:32:04.720 --> 04:32:07.720
Yes, and everything will be snowed up now to spring.

04:32:07.720 --> 04:32:08.720
Oh, no.

04:32:08.720 --> 04:32:10.720
What's happened to our firewood?

04:32:14.720 --> 04:32:16.720
What's the matter?

04:32:16.720 --> 04:32:18.720
There's not much wood left in here.

04:32:18.720 --> 04:32:20.720
Someone else must be burning it.

04:32:20.720 --> 04:32:23.720
Yes, but who and for what I wonder?

04:32:24.720 --> 04:32:26.720
I can feel it.

04:32:26.720 --> 04:32:27.720
We're not alone in this forest.

04:32:27.720 --> 04:32:29.720
I'm sure someone's watching us.

04:32:29.720 --> 04:32:31.720
All those winter creatures.

04:32:31.720 --> 04:32:33.720
No, I don't think it's them.

04:32:37.720 --> 04:32:38.720
The grog.

04:32:38.720 --> 04:32:41.720
Goodness me.

04:32:41.720 --> 04:32:44.720
Look how big she gets in the wintertime.

04:32:44.720 --> 04:32:45.720
Move in.

04:32:45.720 --> 04:32:47.720
I'm scared.

04:32:47.720 --> 04:32:49.720
It'll be all right.

04:32:49.720 --> 04:32:50.720
Grow.

04:32:50.720 --> 04:32:51.720
Stop.

04:32:51.720 --> 04:32:52.720
Right there.

04:32:52.720 --> 04:32:56.720
Don't come any closer if you please.

04:32:56.720 --> 04:32:59.720
You're much, much too cold for us, you see.

04:32:59.720 --> 04:33:02.720
You could freeze a stiff, you know.

04:33:02.720 --> 04:33:03.720
Oh.

04:33:03.720 --> 04:33:06.720
Is it possible that you get cold?

04:33:07.720 --> 04:33:11.720
Is it possible that you get lonely all by yourself?

04:33:11.720 --> 04:33:14.720
I don't think there's anything we can do to help you know.

04:33:14.720 --> 04:33:18.720
Not without fur coats and earmuffs and warm gloves anyway.

04:33:18.720 --> 04:33:20.720
We must go.

04:33:21.720 --> 04:33:22.720
Oh.

04:33:36.720 --> 04:33:38.720
Someone's been stealing our firewood.

04:33:38.720 --> 04:33:40.720
I wonder what they're doing with it.

04:33:40.720 --> 04:33:42.720
Something bad, there's no doubt about that.

04:33:42.720 --> 04:33:45.720
Must've been several people did this.

04:33:51.720 --> 04:33:52.720
Oh.

04:34:02.720 --> 04:34:05.720
We had a lot of fun here in the summer.

04:34:05.720 --> 04:34:06.720
Remember?

04:34:06.720 --> 04:34:09.720
Well, the she is still here round the ice.

04:34:09.720 --> 04:34:10.720
I hope.

04:34:10.720 --> 04:34:12.720
Two, Tiki.

04:34:12.720 --> 04:34:13.720
Two, Tiki.

04:34:15.720 --> 04:34:16.720
There's no one here.

04:34:16.720 --> 04:34:17.720
Are you sure?

04:34:17.720 --> 04:34:18.720
Look for yourself.

04:34:21.720 --> 04:34:24.720
I know they're invisible, but I'm a shroom ice in here.

04:34:24.720 --> 04:34:25.720
Hard to tell.

04:34:25.720 --> 04:34:27.720
Well, things you can't see.

04:34:27.720 --> 04:34:29.720
Oh.

04:34:29.720 --> 04:34:30.720
What is it?

04:34:30.720 --> 04:34:33.720
It felt like something scampering on my back.

04:34:33.720 --> 04:34:34.720
That's all right.

04:34:34.720 --> 04:34:36.720
It must be one of the shroom ice.

04:34:40.720 --> 04:34:41.720
Moman.

04:34:41.720 --> 04:34:42.720
Moman.

04:34:45.720 --> 04:34:47.720
Oh, where could he have gone?

04:34:48.720 --> 04:34:49.720
My goodness.

04:34:49.720 --> 04:34:52.720
I've never seen anything quite like this before.

04:34:52.720 --> 04:34:54.720
Hi, it's good to see you.

04:34:54.720 --> 04:34:55.720
You're right.

04:34:55.720 --> 04:34:56.720
She's fishing.

04:34:56.720 --> 04:34:57.720
Hi, two, Tiki.

04:34:57.720 --> 04:34:59.720
Hello, two, Tiki.

04:34:59.720 --> 04:35:01.720
So this winter's not made in woke up, too, huh?

04:35:01.720 --> 04:35:04.720
I walk her up by mistake.

04:35:04.720 --> 04:35:07.720
You know that spring is still a long way off, don't you?

04:35:07.720 --> 04:35:10.720
I thought it might be seeing there's no sun at all.

04:35:10.720 --> 04:35:13.720
But the sun is going to come back tomorrow, Moman.

04:35:13.720 --> 04:35:14.720
Tomorrow?

04:35:15.720 --> 04:35:18.720
Snork maiden was so worried about the sun not showing.

04:35:18.720 --> 04:35:22.720
The sun will rise tomorrow, Moman, but it'll go down very soon.

04:35:22.720 --> 04:35:26.720
Two Tiki, you know, I think there must be records in Moonwind Valley.

04:35:26.720 --> 04:35:27.720
Records in winter?

04:35:27.720 --> 04:35:31.720
There's an enormous pile of firewood up on the hillside.

04:35:31.720 --> 04:35:32.720
Oh, I know.

04:35:32.720 --> 04:35:34.720
It took a long time to collect that wood.

04:35:34.720 --> 04:35:37.720
But some of it belongs to us.

04:35:37.720 --> 04:35:38.720
Hmm.

04:35:38.720 --> 04:35:40.720
That doesn't really surprise me, though, Moman.

04:35:40.720 --> 04:35:43.720
I'm afraid the winner creatures unfairly careful about ownership.

04:35:43.720 --> 04:35:46.720
They need a lot, so if they see it, they take it.

04:35:46.720 --> 04:35:48.720
It's for their big winner bonfire.

04:35:48.720 --> 04:35:49.720
A bonfire?

04:35:49.720 --> 04:35:53.720
Yes, and now your firewood can take part in the big celebration.

04:35:53.720 --> 04:35:57.720
They light it every winter to make sure the sun comes back, you know.

04:35:57.720 --> 04:36:01.720
Oh, you mean otherwise the sun wouldn't come back to Tiki?

04:36:01.720 --> 04:36:06.720
Well, since they always light it on this day, you don't really know, do you?

04:36:06.720 --> 04:36:08.720
Tonight you might see the winner creatures.

04:36:08.720 --> 04:36:11.720
Oh, can we come along as well to Tiki?

04:36:11.720 --> 04:36:12.720
Yes, you can.

04:36:12.720 --> 04:36:15.720
If you sit quietly and don't scare them in any way.

04:36:15.720 --> 04:36:16.720
Wonderful.

04:36:16.720 --> 04:36:18.720
You're coming along, too, aren't you?

04:36:18.720 --> 04:36:19.720
Of course.

04:36:19.720 --> 04:36:20.720
Stop!

04:36:20.720 --> 04:36:21.720
Help me!

04:36:21.720 --> 04:36:23.720
Someone shouting for help?

04:36:23.720 --> 04:36:24.720
Who could it be?

04:36:24.720 --> 04:36:25.720
Go away!

04:36:25.720 --> 04:36:26.720
Get away from me!

04:36:26.720 --> 04:36:28.720
I didn't do it on purpose!

04:36:28.720 --> 04:36:30.720
I didn't mean any harm!

04:36:30.720 --> 04:36:34.720
If you don't leave me alone, Grandma will turn you into a toad!

04:36:34.720 --> 04:36:36.720
Oh, that's so cold!

04:36:36.720 --> 04:36:37.720
Go away, please!

04:36:37.720 --> 04:36:38.720
Ah!

04:36:38.720 --> 04:36:39.720
Ah!

04:36:39.720 --> 04:36:40.720
Ah!

04:36:40.720 --> 04:36:41.720
Ah!

04:36:41.720 --> 04:36:42.720
Ah!

04:36:42.720 --> 04:36:43.720
Grow!

04:36:43.720 --> 04:36:44.720
Leave her alone!

04:36:44.720 --> 04:36:45.720
What are you doing, Grog?

04:36:45.720 --> 04:36:46.720
Move it!

04:36:46.720 --> 04:36:47.720
Alicia!

04:36:47.720 --> 04:36:48.720
No, listen, Grog.

04:36:48.720 --> 04:36:49.720
Why can't you be nice to her?

04:36:49.720 --> 04:36:50.720
Alicia is one of my friends.

04:36:50.720 --> 04:36:53.720
She was just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis.

04:36:53.720 --> 04:36:56.720
I nearly bumped into her, but I didn't touch her.

04:36:56.720 --> 04:36:58.720
That's all right, Alicia.

04:36:58.720 --> 04:36:59.720
Tell me, Grog.

04:36:59.720 --> 04:37:00.720
Alicia!

04:37:00.720 --> 04:37:01.720
Alicia!

04:37:01.720 --> 04:37:02.720
Now listen, Grog.

04:37:02.720 --> 04:37:03.720
Why can't you be nice to her?

04:37:03.720 --> 04:37:04.720
Alicia is one of my friends.

04:37:04.720 --> 04:37:05.720
She was just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis.

04:37:05.720 --> 04:37:06.720
I nearly bumped into her, but I didn't touch her.

04:37:06.720 --> 04:37:07.720
Tell me, Grog.

04:37:07.720 --> 04:37:08.720
What's gotten into you?

04:37:08.720 --> 04:37:11.720
Why are you so nasty to such a sweet little girl?

04:37:11.720 --> 04:37:13.720
It isn't like you at all.

04:37:13.720 --> 04:37:15.720
I must have startled her, I guess.

04:37:15.720 --> 04:37:18.720
And I did apologize at all, but it made no difference.

04:37:18.720 --> 04:37:20.720
This is really, very odd.

04:37:20.720 --> 04:37:24.720
Then I asked if she had seen you, and that's when she started to get mad at me.

04:37:24.720 --> 04:37:26.720
And she doesn't even know me.

04:37:26.720 --> 04:37:28.720
It's a mystery.

04:37:28.720 --> 04:37:30.720
Whatever's the matter with you, Grog.

04:37:30.720 --> 04:37:46.720
Oh, I was so scared.

04:37:46.720 --> 04:37:48.720
I'm so glad you've come to see us.

04:37:48.720 --> 04:37:50.720
So am I, women.

04:37:50.720 --> 04:37:53.720
Somehow I felt certain you hadn't gone into hibernation yet.

04:37:53.720 --> 04:37:56.720
But what did your grandmother say?

04:37:56.720 --> 04:37:59.720
Nothing because I didn't tell her I was coming.

04:37:59.720 --> 04:38:01.720
Thank you for chasing off that terrible monster.

04:38:01.720 --> 04:38:04.720
The Grog hasn't actually ever attacked anyone.

04:38:04.720 --> 04:38:07.720
Well, maybe she doesn't like the look of Alicia.

04:38:07.720 --> 04:38:09.720
Snork maiden.

04:38:09.720 --> 04:38:12.720
It's really a mystery to me why the Grog was here at all.

04:38:12.720 --> 04:38:15.720
She was here looking for a moment no doubt.

04:38:15.720 --> 04:38:16.720
Was she?

04:38:16.720 --> 04:38:19.720
He suddenly become very popular.

04:38:19.720 --> 04:38:20.720
Huh?

04:38:20.720 --> 04:38:22.720
You don't mean...

04:38:22.720 --> 04:38:37.720
What's the matter with you?

04:38:37.720 --> 04:38:40.720
I think the Grog may have fallen in love with you, woman.

04:38:40.720 --> 04:38:41.720
What?

04:38:41.720 --> 04:38:43.720
Oh, you can't mean that.

04:38:43.720 --> 04:38:45.720
Please tell me you're not serious.

04:38:45.720 --> 04:38:47.720
It's out of the question.

04:38:47.720 --> 04:38:49.720
It's her ridiculous idea.

04:38:49.720 --> 04:38:51.720
Don't be so silly.

04:39:08.720 --> 04:39:11.720
Where's all that drumming noise coming from?

04:39:11.720 --> 04:39:13.720
From the invisible shroom ice.

04:39:13.720 --> 04:39:16.720
How long before everybody arrives?

04:39:16.720 --> 04:39:19.720
Oh, they're here already, moving all around us.

04:39:19.720 --> 04:39:20.720
They are?

04:39:20.720 --> 04:39:21.720
Where?

04:39:21.720 --> 04:39:22.720
I can't see them.

04:39:22.720 --> 04:39:24.720
Are they really invisible?

04:39:24.720 --> 04:39:29.720
I can't see them either, but I can feel their presence all around me.

04:39:29.720 --> 04:39:32.720
But she's been studying witchcraft, hasn't she?

04:39:32.720 --> 04:39:37.720
I'm sure you and moving will be able to feel their presence quite soon.

04:40:17.720 --> 04:40:18.720
Oh.

04:40:21.720 --> 04:40:25.720
I can see some of them looking all over there.

04:40:34.720 --> 04:40:37.720
I think I see them too, you guys.

04:40:38.720 --> 04:40:40.720
What the hell?

04:40:43.720 --> 04:40:46.720
Food, you tell me, why can't we see all of them?

04:40:46.720 --> 04:40:48.720
Well, we can never see them all.

04:40:48.720 --> 04:40:52.720
I don't understand how did you know earlier all the shroom ice was playing the drums.

04:40:52.720 --> 04:40:56.720
I just know because they sometimes play them in the batch house as well.

04:40:56.720 --> 04:40:58.720
What a wonderful celebration.

04:40:58.720 --> 04:41:03.720
Isn't it lucky I came over here if I had not have missed a most memorable evening?

04:41:08.720 --> 04:41:11.720
What's going on here?

04:41:11.720 --> 04:41:13.720
The grog.

04:41:13.720 --> 04:41:14.720
What?

04:41:16.720 --> 04:41:19.720
What's she going?

04:41:19.720 --> 04:41:23.720
She must be looking for a movement again, I guess.

04:41:23.720 --> 04:41:27.720
No, I think she just wants to warm herself by the fire.

04:41:27.720 --> 04:41:30.720
But what's she doing?

04:41:58.720 --> 04:42:03.720
Well, that's the end of the mid-winter bonfire.

04:42:03.720 --> 04:42:07.720
Poor grog, she freezes everything she touches.

04:42:07.720 --> 04:42:13.720
Whatever she sits on, even the hottest bonfire, turns freezing cold in a matter of seconds.

04:42:13.720 --> 04:42:17.720
Well, at least she's managed to save some of our wood.

04:42:18.720 --> 04:42:20.720
Oh, no.

04:42:26.720 --> 04:42:29.720
Hold on tight now, Snorkemaid, and I'll be careful.

04:42:29.720 --> 04:42:32.720
I can't wait to get into bed.

04:42:32.720 --> 04:42:35.720
I wanted to stay up until the sun came up again.

04:42:35.720 --> 04:42:38.720
But I don't know if I could keep awake till then.

04:42:38.720 --> 04:42:41.720
So long till spring, man, man.

04:42:41.720 --> 04:42:43.720
Goodbye.

04:42:43.720 --> 04:42:46.720
And take care, Alicia.

04:42:46.720 --> 04:42:50.720
I will move in. The moon will light my way back.

04:43:08.720 --> 04:43:10.720
This time the movements have gone too far.

04:43:10.720 --> 04:43:15.720
Something must be done. I'll teach them a lesson they'll never forget.

04:43:16.720 --> 04:43:18.720
They won't get the battle with me.

04:43:20.720 --> 04:43:24.720
Now, what does the witch mean by teach them a lesson?

04:43:24.720 --> 04:43:26.720
That sounds very ominous.

04:43:26.720 --> 04:43:30.720
Let's hope at least that she lets them sleep till next spring.

04:43:37.720 --> 04:43:44.720
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

04:43:44.720 --> 04:43:51.720
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

04:43:51.720 --> 04:43:55.720
They're always happy and goes at play.

04:43:55.720 --> 04:43:59.720
The movements are having fun day after day.

04:43:59.720 --> 04:44:02.720
The movements.

04:44:02.720 --> 04:44:06.720
The movements.

04:44:06.720 --> 04:44:12.720
The movements.

04:44:14.720 --> 04:44:21.720
The movements.

04:44:36.720 --> 04:44:39.720
Here they are for one and all.

04:44:39.720 --> 04:44:42.720
The movements are about to come.

04:44:42.720 --> 04:44:45.720
They're up down here with me.

04:44:45.720 --> 04:44:48.720
They're up for you on your TV.

04:44:48.720 --> 04:44:51.720
They are the movements.

04:44:51.720 --> 04:44:54.720
They are the movements.

04:44:54.720 --> 04:44:57.720
So come with me, give me your hand.

04:44:57.720 --> 04:45:00.720
I'll take you up to a moment land.

04:45:00.720 --> 04:45:03.720
You can fly just like a bird.

04:45:03.720 --> 04:45:06.720
Sing that song ever.

04:45:06.720 --> 04:45:09.720
There were the movements.

04:45:09.720 --> 04:45:14.720
There were the movements.

04:45:14.720 --> 04:45:18.720
There were the movements.

04:45:18.720 --> 04:45:20.720
There were the movements.

04:45:39.720 --> 04:46:09.720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

04:46:09.720 --> 04:46:38.860
heh heh heh, heh heh, heh heh heh heh heh, heh heh, heh heh, heh heh.. The witch has come to Murman Valley..

04:46:38.860 --> 04:46:40.860
Could you be up to this time?

04:46:40.860 --> 04:47:01.860
Eldritch Cabalazum!

04:47:01.860 --> 04:47:03.860
Oh, it's snowing again.

04:47:03.860 --> 04:47:05.860
I must get a covered brown.

04:47:08.860 --> 04:47:36.860
The great thaw had come at last.

04:47:36.860 --> 04:47:48.860
The movement valley.

04:47:48.860 --> 04:47:53.860
I think I can smell spring.

04:47:53.860 --> 04:48:04.860
Oh, I've never seen anything like this one before.

04:48:04.860 --> 04:48:06.860
Hello there, Mr. Hemielun.

04:48:06.860 --> 04:48:08.860
Hello, Sniff. You're up early this year?

04:48:08.860 --> 04:48:12.860
Yes. I think I've even beat Momen to it.

04:48:12.860 --> 04:48:22.860
Is that so? Why are the moments so late this year?

04:48:22.860 --> 04:48:27.860
Momen, wake up! Spring is here! It's time to wake up!

04:48:28.860 --> 04:48:31.860
Maybe Snork Maiden's easier to wake up.

04:48:31.860 --> 04:48:34.860
Snork Maiden!

04:48:34.860 --> 04:48:39.860
And I thought I was difficult to wake up. I must get closer.

04:48:49.860 --> 04:48:51.860
What are you doing, Sniff?

04:48:51.860 --> 04:48:53.860
What am I doing? You can see, can't you?

04:48:53.860 --> 04:48:55.860
Of course I can, but why are you climbing up that?

04:48:55.860 --> 04:48:57.860
Momen and Snork Maiden are still asleep.

04:48:57.860 --> 04:48:58.860
I have to wake them up.

04:48:58.860 --> 04:49:02.860
Why don't you go this way? It's easier.

04:49:02.860 --> 04:49:11.860
What do I do now?

04:49:11.860 --> 04:49:19.860
Funny, even Momen still asleep.

04:49:19.860 --> 04:49:23.860
Wrong room.

04:49:23.860 --> 04:49:33.860
Come on, wake up, lazy bones.

04:49:33.860 --> 04:49:37.860
Momen, spring has come.

04:49:37.860 --> 04:49:40.860
Well, look at that. Wake up, you sleepyhead.

04:49:40.860 --> 04:49:43.860
Oh, you really are impossible.

04:49:43.860 --> 04:49:49.860
Momen, Momen, Momen! This is odd, even for Momen.

04:49:49.860 --> 04:49:52.860
Open the window, little Mai!

04:49:53.860 --> 04:50:02.860
Oh, was I scared?

04:50:02.860 --> 04:50:04.860
Oh, I haven't you opened them up.

04:50:04.860 --> 04:50:07.860
I've tried, but they won't.

04:50:07.860 --> 04:50:11.860
You're kidding.

04:50:11.860 --> 04:50:14.860
No one can resist this little Mai.

04:50:14.860 --> 04:50:18.860
Wake up, old man. I know you're ticklish.

04:50:19.860 --> 04:50:23.860
Momen, Momen!

04:50:23.860 --> 04:50:25.860
I told you so.

04:50:27.860 --> 04:50:31.860
Momen, come on!

04:50:33.860 --> 04:50:35.860
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

04:50:35.860 --> 04:50:36.860
Ah, ah, ah!

04:50:36.860 --> 04:50:41.860
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

04:50:41.860 --> 04:50:44.860
How strange!

04:50:44.860 --> 04:50:45.860
How sad!

04:50:45.860 --> 04:50:47.060
Eh? What do you mean?

04:50:47.060 --> 04:50:48.380
I think...

04:50:48.380 --> 04:50:50.060
Well, you don't think...

04:50:50.060 --> 04:50:51.580
You don't think that...

04:50:51.580 --> 04:50:52.660
It's hard to tell.

04:50:52.660 --> 04:50:54.420
I was listening for his heartbeat.

04:50:56.660 --> 04:50:58.060
He's still breathing.

04:50:59.660 --> 04:51:01.060
And snort-baited?

04:51:02.980 --> 04:51:06.060
Wake up, you slug-up ass!

04:51:06.060 --> 04:51:08.060
Snort-baited!

04:51:08.460 --> 04:51:09.860
They won't wake up.

04:51:10.660 --> 04:51:11.860
This is strange.

04:51:11.860 --> 04:51:13.260
Why don't we go and try the other?

04:51:13.260 --> 04:51:14.660
Yes, why not?

04:51:14.660 --> 04:51:17.460
I hate it when others are asleep while I'm up.

04:51:17.460 --> 04:51:20.060
But then I don't like it much the other way around either.

04:51:20.060 --> 04:51:21.060
Do I sniff?

04:51:24.860 --> 04:51:26.660
Moment pop up, please wake up!

04:51:26.660 --> 04:51:29.060
We've tried to wake up moment, but he won't!

04:51:29.060 --> 04:51:31.260
Wakey-moomin' mama breakfast time!

04:51:31.260 --> 04:51:32.860
Come on, moment pop up!

04:51:32.860 --> 04:51:33.860
Wake up!

04:51:35.460 --> 04:51:37.060
This is no use!

04:51:44.860 --> 04:51:48.060
Goodness, it seems the moomin's are still hibernating.

04:51:48.060 --> 04:51:50.060
And so it's snort-baiting.

04:51:50.060 --> 04:51:53.060
That's odd, she always wakes up even before me.

04:51:53.060 --> 04:51:56.660
Oh, moment two, but this year it seems to be different!

04:51:56.660 --> 04:51:59.860
I'll go back home, and I'll come over again in a little while

04:51:59.860 --> 04:52:02.060
when the moomin' family will have woken up.

04:52:02.060 --> 04:52:03.460
If they ever do.

04:52:03.460 --> 04:52:04.460
Huh?

04:52:04.460 --> 04:52:07.460
We've tried everything to wake them up short of buckets of water

04:52:07.460 --> 04:52:09.060
and there's no moving them.

04:52:09.060 --> 04:52:12.260
We've shouted and shook and pinched and tickled and stopped!

04:52:12.260 --> 04:52:13.460
Oh, dear!

04:52:13.460 --> 04:52:15.860
It's not just strange, it's ominous!

04:52:15.860 --> 04:52:17.860
Oh, my, surely not.

04:52:18.860 --> 04:52:20.660
Hello, everybody!

04:52:21.660 --> 04:52:23.460
How is everyone?

04:52:23.460 --> 04:52:24.260
What is it?

04:52:24.260 --> 04:52:26.060
You all look very scared.

04:52:27.460 --> 04:52:28.860
Huh?

04:52:28.860 --> 04:52:30.860
Still hibernating?

04:52:35.060 --> 04:52:37.460
It's all very strange, have you lint?

04:52:39.060 --> 04:52:40.260
Moment!

04:52:41.460 --> 04:52:42.260
See?

04:52:42.260 --> 04:52:43.860
Yes, indeed!

04:52:46.260 --> 04:52:48.460
How we can really do is wait and see.

04:52:48.460 --> 04:52:50.060
I suppose you're right.

04:52:50.060 --> 04:52:53.460
Don't worry, the days are getting longer all the time now.

04:52:53.460 --> 04:52:55.860
So the moomin's can't sleep much longer.

04:52:55.860 --> 04:52:57.860
And snort-baiting?

04:52:57.860 --> 04:52:59.860
Cheat-tool, of course.

04:53:00.460 --> 04:53:03.260
Bet you anything, moment wakes up when Snuffkin returns.

04:53:03.260 --> 04:53:05.260
I think you're right, Sniff.

04:53:06.260 --> 04:53:09.860
And then, one day about a week later,

04:53:09.860 --> 04:53:13.460
Snuffkin did come back from his yearly trip south.

04:53:44.260 --> 04:53:45.260
Snuffkin!

04:53:46.860 --> 04:53:47.860
Snuffkin!

04:53:52.660 --> 04:53:54.260
Snuffkin!

04:54:14.060 --> 04:54:16.060
Snuffkin!

04:54:17.060 --> 04:54:18.460
Where's the moomin'?

04:54:18.460 --> 04:54:19.660
He's in bad.

04:54:19.660 --> 04:54:21.660
Moomin' still asleep.

04:54:22.460 --> 04:54:23.660
A sleep?

04:54:32.260 --> 04:54:34.660
They won't wake up no matter what you do.

04:54:35.860 --> 04:54:37.860
What do you think, Snuffkin?

04:54:37.860 --> 04:54:39.660
I think they're very sick.

04:54:39.660 --> 04:54:41.460
That's a possibility.

04:54:41.460 --> 04:54:43.260
Sleeping sickness, perhaps?

04:54:43.260 --> 04:54:45.460
It's very difficult to say.

04:54:45.460 --> 04:54:47.460
To me, though, if you want my honest opinion,

04:54:47.460 --> 04:54:50.460
I think somebody has cast a very nasty spell on them.

04:54:51.460 --> 04:54:52.660
A spell?

04:54:52.660 --> 04:54:54.460
But who would do that?

04:54:54.460 --> 04:54:56.060
I think I know.

04:54:56.060 --> 04:54:57.060
Huh?

04:54:57.060 --> 04:54:58.660
Are you mean the witch?

04:54:58.660 --> 04:55:00.860
Alice is grandmother, but why?

04:55:00.860 --> 04:55:03.460
To tell you the truth, I haven't the biggest idea.

04:55:03.460 --> 04:55:05.460
How do we find out?

04:55:07.260 --> 04:55:09.260
I'll go to the forest and see her.

04:55:09.260 --> 04:55:12.260
And if she did cast a spell, do you think she'd tell you?

04:55:12.260 --> 04:55:14.860
I really don't know, but we have to do something.

04:55:14.860 --> 04:55:17.660
We can't just leave them sleeping here forever.

04:55:18.860 --> 04:55:20.260
I'll go with you.

04:55:20.260 --> 04:55:23.460
I guess I'd better stay here to take care of things.

04:55:23.460 --> 04:55:26.460
Well, if they suddenly wake up, somebody needs to be here.

04:55:27.660 --> 04:55:29.260
Snuffkin...

04:55:29.260 --> 04:55:29.860
Huh?

04:55:29.860 --> 04:55:31.060
That's him!

04:55:31.060 --> 04:55:32.060
At last!

04:55:32.060 --> 04:55:33.060
Moomin'!

04:55:33.060 --> 04:55:34.260
Moomin'!

04:55:34.260 --> 04:55:35.260
Moomin'!

04:55:37.260 --> 04:55:38.860
He's dreaming.

04:55:38.860 --> 04:55:41.460
Just looking at him makes me feel sleepy.

04:55:43.260 --> 04:55:44.260
Moomin'!

04:55:44.260 --> 04:55:47.260
I promise to get this horrible spell cast off for you.

04:56:13.260 --> 04:56:14.260
Hush!

04:56:18.260 --> 04:56:20.260
Where are you going?

04:56:20.260 --> 04:56:24.260
I've done all the chores, even washed out your old potion jars.

04:56:24.260 --> 04:56:26.260
So, where are you going?

04:56:26.260 --> 04:56:27.260
Spring is here, Grandma.

04:56:27.260 --> 04:56:30.260
I thought I'd take some time off to celebrate.

04:56:30.260 --> 04:56:32.260
But what about your work?

04:56:32.260 --> 04:56:35.260
I'm just going out for the day, Grandma.

04:56:35.260 --> 04:56:37.260
And I know where.

04:56:37.260 --> 04:56:40.260
I only want to know where you're going.

04:56:40.260 --> 04:56:42.260
And I know where.

04:56:42.260 --> 04:56:44.260
I only want to see the Moomin's.

04:56:44.260 --> 04:56:46.260
They're still hibernating.

04:56:46.260 --> 04:56:48.260
No, they're not. It isn't winter anymore.

04:56:48.260 --> 04:56:52.260
Winter or spring, I happen to know the Moomin's are still asleep.

04:56:52.260 --> 04:56:55.260
How could you know what the Moomin's are up to, Grandma?

04:56:55.260 --> 04:56:56.260
Hm.

04:56:56.260 --> 04:56:58.260
Oh, which is no everything, my dear girl.

04:56:58.260 --> 04:56:59.260
Really?

04:56:59.260 --> 04:57:01.260
Well, I'll go and see.

04:57:01.260 --> 04:57:03.260
Come here!

04:57:04.260 --> 04:57:14.260
I have to admit that I can't help being worried about the Moomin's.

04:57:14.260 --> 04:57:17.260
Their windows are open for the spring.

04:57:17.260 --> 04:57:20.260
So they can smell the first spring flowers.

04:57:20.260 --> 04:57:23.260
Well, I suppose I'd miss beginning on.

04:57:28.260 --> 04:57:31.260
Why didn't you tell them about the witch in the spell?

04:57:31.260 --> 04:57:34.260
Well, after all, that was just an idea, I got.

04:57:34.260 --> 04:57:36.260
Ideas can be embarrassing if you were wrong,

04:57:36.260 --> 04:57:39.260
so don't tell anyone for the time being.

04:57:39.260 --> 04:57:40.260
All right.

04:57:40.260 --> 04:57:41.260
I'm going.

04:57:43.260 --> 04:57:45.260
And I'm leaving, too.

04:57:45.260 --> 04:57:46.260
Okay.

04:57:52.260 --> 04:57:54.260
There's Alicia.

04:57:54.260 --> 04:57:57.260
Hi, everyone. It's me.

04:57:57.260 --> 04:57:59.260
Why do you get a teller?

04:57:59.260 --> 04:58:02.260
I can't live the truth, I guess.

04:58:08.260 --> 04:58:11.260
The best thing would be for me to talk to her first.

04:58:11.260 --> 04:58:12.260
Yes, I agree.

04:58:12.260 --> 04:58:15.260
She's unbelievable. How could she?

04:58:18.260 --> 04:58:21.260
I can hardly believe you could be so mean, Grandma.

04:58:21.260 --> 04:58:23.260
Calm down, my dear.

04:58:23.260 --> 04:58:26.260
Why, I did it all for you, Alicia.

04:58:26.260 --> 04:58:28.260
You did it for me.

04:58:28.260 --> 04:58:30.260
The moments are asleep. Why should you go there?

04:58:30.260 --> 04:58:32.260
Do them a world of good, too, along sleep.

04:58:32.260 --> 04:58:34.260
How ridiculous, Grandma!

04:58:34.260 --> 04:58:37.260
Alicia, you've done quite well in your studies, and if you keep at it,

04:58:37.260 --> 04:58:42.260
I see no reason why you shouldn't be a fully fledged witch before 30.

04:58:42.260 --> 04:58:46.260
And if I do see the moments, I won't be a witch till I'm 31.

04:58:46.260 --> 04:58:47.260
Is that what you mean?

04:58:47.260 --> 04:58:50.260
Now, the moments are very bad, and the ones on you.

04:58:50.260 --> 04:58:53.260
They are so disgustingly good, and if you want to be a witch,

04:58:53.260 --> 04:58:55.260
you mustn't see them.

04:58:56.260 --> 04:58:57.260
Hmm.

04:58:59.260 --> 04:59:02.260
And if I promise never to go near Moomin Valley again,

04:59:02.260 --> 04:59:04.260
will you lift the spell, Grandma?

04:59:04.260 --> 04:59:07.260
Good girl, that's exactly what I wanted here.

04:59:07.260 --> 04:59:09.260
You promise me, Dan, Alicia?

04:59:09.260 --> 04:59:10.260
I promise, Grandma.

04:59:10.260 --> 04:59:12.260
Right. The spell should be lifted.

04:59:12.260 --> 04:59:13.260
Snuff guard.

04:59:13.260 --> 04:59:14.260
What do you want?

04:59:14.260 --> 04:59:18.260
There are two different ways of lifting the spell I cast on the moments.

04:59:18.260 --> 04:59:19.260
Uh-huh.

04:59:19.260 --> 04:59:22.260
The first one is that I go to Moomin Valley myself and chant the magic words

04:59:22.260 --> 04:59:24.260
outside their bedroom window.

04:59:24.260 --> 04:59:27.260
Oh, Grandma, that's not a good idea.

04:59:27.260 --> 04:59:32.260
Oh, oh, you mean people might be upset about me casting a spell on the moments?

04:59:32.260 --> 04:59:33.260
You may be right.

04:59:33.260 --> 04:59:38.260
So therefore, Snuff Kid, I have no choice but to ask you to perform the task.

04:59:38.260 --> 04:59:40.260
Oh, but why me?

04:59:40.260 --> 04:59:42.260
You do have your harmonica with you?

04:59:42.260 --> 04:59:43.260
Of course.

04:59:43.260 --> 04:59:44.260
Let me have it, please.

04:59:48.260 --> 04:59:50.260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

04:59:50.260 --> 04:59:51.260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

04:59:51.260 --> 04:59:52.260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

04:59:52.260 --> 04:59:53.260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

04:59:53.260 --> 04:59:54.260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

04:59:54.260 --> 04:59:59.260
If you don't stop staring at me, my witchcraft won't be effective.

04:59:59.260 --> 05:00:02.260
Alicia, get me the next potion now.

05:00:02.260 --> 05:00:03.260
Oh.

05:00:03.260 --> 05:00:04.260
Oh.

05:00:04.260 --> 05:00:06.260
All right, grandmother.

05:00:10.260 --> 05:00:11.260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

05:00:11.260 --> 05:00:12.260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

05:00:12.260 --> 05:00:13.260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

05:00:13.260 --> 05:00:14.260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

05:00:14.260 --> 05:00:16.260
So she can't do it if we look at her, huh?

05:00:16.260 --> 05:00:17.260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

05:00:17.260 --> 05:00:18.260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

05:00:18.260 --> 05:00:20.260
Now, listen, Inspector.

05:00:20.260 --> 05:00:21.260
You must do something.

05:00:21.260 --> 05:00:23.260
You are the police, aren't you?

05:00:23.260 --> 05:00:28.260
Well, I have to tell you, waking people up is not really part of our job.

05:00:28.260 --> 05:00:30.260
But you're our last hope, Inspector.

05:00:30.260 --> 05:00:31.260
You must do something.

05:00:31.260 --> 05:00:35.260
Perhaps if you could possibly use your whistle to wake them up.

05:00:35.260 --> 05:00:36.260
Uh-huh.

05:00:36.260 --> 05:00:37.260
It's very shrill indoors.

05:00:37.260 --> 05:00:38.260
Good frighten them.

05:00:38.260 --> 05:00:39.260
And fire your revolver.

05:00:39.260 --> 05:00:41.260
I'm sure that would do it, Inspector.

05:00:41.260 --> 05:00:43.260
Oh, I don't carry guns.

05:00:43.260 --> 05:00:44.260
They're dangerous.

05:00:45.260 --> 05:00:46.260
Oh, no.

05:00:52.260 --> 05:00:54.260
Hey, Snuffkin!

05:00:54.260 --> 05:00:56.260
Little Y!

05:00:56.260 --> 05:00:57.260
He sounds worried.

05:00:57.260 --> 05:00:59.260
I bet they're still fast asleep.

05:00:59.260 --> 05:01:00.260
Hmm.

05:01:03.260 --> 05:01:05.260
Right, Snuffkin?

05:01:05.260 --> 05:01:06.260
Get on with it.

05:01:15.260 --> 05:01:16.260
No.

05:01:16.260 --> 05:01:18.260
No.

05:01:24.260 --> 05:01:25.260
Hmm.

05:01:25.260 --> 05:01:26.260
It's not working, is it?

05:01:26.260 --> 05:01:28.260
Get my chance, Snuff.

05:01:36.260 --> 05:01:37.260
No.

05:01:37.260 --> 05:01:40.260
Snuffkin!

05:01:40.260 --> 05:01:41.260
Snorkemaedun!

05:01:41.260 --> 05:01:42.260
Wake up!

05:01:42.260 --> 05:01:43.260
Sprang is here!

05:01:43.260 --> 05:01:44.260
Here, come on!

05:01:44.260 --> 05:01:45.260
Ah!

05:01:45.260 --> 05:01:46.260
Hmm.

05:01:46.260 --> 05:01:47.260
Hmm.

05:01:47.260 --> 05:01:48.260
Hmm.

05:01:48.260 --> 05:01:49.260
Hmm.

05:01:49.260 --> 05:01:50.260
Hmm.

05:01:50.260 --> 05:01:51.260
Hmm.

05:01:51.260 --> 05:01:52.260
Hmm.

05:01:52.260 --> 05:01:56.260
Oh, spring is here already.

05:01:56.260 --> 05:01:58.260
Good morning, Papa Deer.

05:01:58.260 --> 05:01:59.260
Hmm.

05:01:59.260 --> 05:02:00.260
Good morning.

05:02:00.260 --> 05:02:02.260
I have a feeling we've over-slaped.

05:02:02.260 --> 05:02:04.260
I wonder whether the others are up yet.

05:02:04.260 --> 05:02:05.260
Hmm.

05:02:05.260 --> 05:02:08.260
Oh, she's made a fool of you, Snuffkin.

05:02:08.260 --> 05:02:09.260
I'm shot up, Snuff!

05:02:09.260 --> 05:02:12.260
Maybe she forgot how to cast off the spell.

05:02:13.260 --> 05:02:14.260
Hi, Snuffkin!

05:02:14.260 --> 05:02:15.260
Hi!

05:02:15.260 --> 05:02:16.260
Ah!

05:02:16.260 --> 05:02:17.260
Morning!

05:02:18.260 --> 05:02:20.260
Morning, everybody!

05:02:20.260 --> 05:02:22.260
Hi, Snuffkin!

05:02:24.260 --> 05:02:28.260
I'm so glad you've arrived back already, Snuffkin.

05:02:28.260 --> 05:02:29.260
Yes.

05:02:29.260 --> 05:02:31.260
You woke up early, too.

05:02:31.260 --> 05:02:33.260
Did you hear that?

05:02:33.260 --> 05:02:35.260
It's you that woke up late, Booman.

05:02:35.260 --> 05:02:37.260
Who me?

05:02:37.260 --> 05:02:38.260
Hmm.

05:02:38.260 --> 05:02:39.260
Ah.

05:02:39.260 --> 05:02:47.260
Now I say, Moomans are ready up and about!

05:02:47.260 --> 05:02:48.260
What?

05:02:48.260 --> 05:02:50.260
I snored!

05:02:50.260 --> 05:02:52.260
Oh, it's you, you're awake.

05:02:52.260 --> 05:02:54.260
I'm glad I didn't blow my whistle.

05:02:54.260 --> 05:02:56.260
But we did have a reason to be worried, Inspector.

05:02:56.260 --> 05:02:57.260
He's right.

05:02:57.260 --> 05:02:59.260
What about Moom and Mama?

05:02:59.260 --> 05:03:00.260
And Moom and Papa?

05:03:00.260 --> 05:03:02.260
Oh, there, everybody.

05:03:02.260 --> 05:03:04.260
Is anything the matter?

05:03:04.260 --> 05:03:05.260
Nothing at all.

05:03:05.260 --> 05:03:06.260
They're awake.

05:03:06.260 --> 05:03:07.260
Oh, there.

05:03:07.260 --> 05:03:08.260
I don't understand.

05:03:08.260 --> 05:03:10.260
You don't understand words.

05:03:10.260 --> 05:03:13.260
We were very worried because you just wouldn't wake up.

05:03:13.260 --> 05:03:14.260
Oh, really?

05:03:14.260 --> 05:03:16.260
You do know we always have a night, don't you?

05:03:16.260 --> 05:03:18.260
We sleep all winter and we always wake up in this room.

05:03:18.260 --> 05:03:22.260
Of course, of course, but this year, start your telling.

05:03:22.260 --> 05:03:23.260
Right.

05:03:23.260 --> 05:03:24.260
Well, we did have a bit of a problem.

05:03:24.260 --> 05:03:27.260
You see, Moom and Papa, we couldn't snuffkin.

05:03:27.260 --> 05:03:29.260
You're back already, yes?

05:03:29.260 --> 05:03:31.260
Why don't you listen to us, Moom and Papa?

05:03:31.260 --> 05:03:32.260
Very well.

05:03:32.260 --> 05:03:33.260
Very well.

05:03:33.260 --> 05:03:36.260
Why don't you all come in and we'll have a nice cup of tea.

05:03:36.260 --> 05:03:39.260
And we can discuss your problem properly.

05:03:39.260 --> 05:03:42.260
But it's your problem, I'm afraid, not ours.

05:03:42.260 --> 05:03:43.260
What does he mean?

05:03:43.260 --> 05:03:45.260
We don't have a problem, do we?

05:03:45.260 --> 05:03:48.260
Please do come in anyway, everybody.

05:03:48.260 --> 05:03:49.260
Please.

05:03:49.260 --> 05:03:50.260
You too.

05:03:50.260 --> 05:03:51.260
All of you, come in.

05:03:51.260 --> 05:03:53.260
Come in, everybody.

05:03:55.260 --> 05:03:56.260
I'm on the side.

05:03:56.260 --> 05:03:57.260
I'm in Georgia.

05:04:02.260 --> 05:04:08.260
Whatever happened to us this year.

05:04:08.260 --> 05:04:09.260
Hey, snuffkin.

05:04:15.260 --> 05:04:16.260
Alicia!

05:04:16.260 --> 05:04:17.260
Alicia!

05:04:22.260 --> 05:04:24.260
Oh, my man!

05:04:24.260 --> 05:04:26.260
We've come to see you, Alicia.

05:04:26.260 --> 05:04:28.260
That was nice of you.

05:04:28.260 --> 05:04:31.260
Your grandmother isn't home, is she?

05:04:31.260 --> 05:04:32.260
No.

05:04:32.260 --> 05:04:34.260
Then we can play hide and seek.

05:04:34.260 --> 05:04:35.260
I can't.

05:04:35.260 --> 05:04:37.260
I promised grandma there.

05:04:37.260 --> 05:04:38.260
Yes, I know.

05:04:38.260 --> 05:04:39.260
Snuffkin told me.

05:04:39.260 --> 05:04:41.260
That was a really great thing to do.

05:04:41.260 --> 05:04:43.260
But you didn't promise not to see us.

05:04:43.260 --> 05:04:46.260
You just promised not to go to Moom and Valley, didn't you?

05:04:46.260 --> 05:04:47.260
Yeah.

05:04:47.260 --> 05:04:50.260
And listen, you never promised not to play with us either, did you?

05:04:50.260 --> 05:04:51.260
No.

05:04:51.260 --> 05:04:55.260
So, if we came here to see you instead of you to us, then it's all right.

05:04:55.260 --> 05:04:57.260
And you don't have to break your promise.

05:04:57.260 --> 05:04:59.260
Oh, I suppose so.

05:04:59.260 --> 05:05:01.260
Yes, I suppose you're right.

05:05:01.260 --> 05:05:03.260
Well, let's play.

05:05:03.260 --> 05:05:04.260
Yeah.

05:05:04.260 --> 05:05:12.260
13, 4, 3, 5, 8.

05:05:12.260 --> 05:05:19.260
Oh!

05:05:19.260 --> 05:05:30.260
That afternoon, they all had the most wonderful time playing hide and seek in the woods.

05:05:30.260 --> 05:05:32.260
Ha ha ha ha ha!

05:05:32.260 --> 05:05:33.260
Hi!

05:05:33.260 --> 05:05:34.260
Jule!

05:05:34.260 --> 05:05:35.260
Three!

05:05:35.260 --> 05:05:37.260
Your teeth are!

05:05:37.260 --> 05:05:38.260
Five!

05:05:38.260 --> 05:05:39.260
Six!

05:05:39.260 --> 05:05:40.260
Seven!

05:05:40.260 --> 05:05:41.260
Ha ha ha ha!

05:05:41.260 --> 05:05:42.260
Nine!

05:05:42.260 --> 05:05:43.260
Ten!

05:05:43.260 --> 05:05:44.260
Eleven!

05:05:44.260 --> 05:05:45.260
One!

05:05:45.260 --> 05:05:49.260
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

05:05:49.260 --> 05:06:11.260
We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

05:06:11.260 --> 05:06:15.260
They're always happy and goes at play.

05:06:15.260 --> 05:06:19.260
The movements are having fun day after day.

05:06:19.260 --> 05:06:22.260
The movements.

05:06:22.260 --> 05:06:25.260
The movements.

05:06:25.260 --> 05:06:32.260
The movements.

05:06:45.260 --> 05:06:57.260
Here they are for one and all.

05:06:57.260 --> 05:07:00.260
The movements are about to come.

05:07:00.260 --> 05:07:03.260
Come on and sit down here with me.

05:07:03.260 --> 05:07:06.260
They're here for you on your TV.

05:07:06.260 --> 05:07:09.260
They are the movements.

05:07:09.260 --> 05:07:12.260
They are the movements.

05:07:12.260 --> 05:07:15.260
So come with me, give me your hand.

05:07:15.260 --> 05:07:18.260
I'll take you up to a movement land.

05:07:18.260 --> 05:07:21.260
You can fly just like a bird.

05:07:21.260 --> 05:07:23.260
Sing that song ever.

05:07:23.260 --> 05:07:26.260
There were the movements.

05:07:26.260 --> 05:07:29.260
There were the movements.

05:07:29.260 --> 05:07:32.260
There were the movements.

05:07:32.260 --> 05:07:35.260
There were the movements.

05:07:35.260 --> 05:07:38.260
There were the movements.

05:07:38.260 --> 05:07:41.260
There were the movements.

05:07:41.260 --> 05:07:44.260
There were the movements.

05:07:44.260 --> 05:07:47.260
There were the movements.

05:07:47.260 --> 05:07:50.260
There were the movements.

05:07:50.260 --> 05:07:53.260
What?

05:07:53.260 --> 05:07:55.260
What?

05:07:55.260 --> 05:07:57.260
What?

05:07:57.260 --> 05:08:02.260
Big explosions could be heard in Woman Valley almost every night.

05:08:02.260 --> 05:08:04.260
And women couldn't sleep a wink.

05:08:04.260 --> 05:08:08.260
Usually there was just one, but sometimes even two.

05:08:09.260 --> 05:08:13.260
You heard it too, Mom and Papa.

05:08:13.260 --> 05:08:16.260
Yes, those loud bangs are keeping me awake.

05:08:16.260 --> 05:08:21.260
I wonder if there'll be another one.

05:08:21.260 --> 05:08:24.260
They seem to be coming from the north.

05:08:24.260 --> 05:08:26.260
Hmm, he starts out.

05:08:26.260 --> 05:08:28.260
Or they could be coming from lonely mountains.

05:08:28.260 --> 05:08:31.260
If you ask me, I believe they're the work of the witch.

05:08:31.260 --> 05:08:32.260
The witch?

05:08:32.260 --> 05:08:34.260
But witches don't make a lot of noise.

05:08:35.260 --> 05:08:38.260
You never know. They're sneaky characters.

05:08:38.260 --> 05:08:41.260
Tomorrow I'll have a few words with the inspector.

05:08:41.260 --> 05:08:43.260
It's up to him to put a stop to it.

05:08:43.260 --> 05:08:46.260
Papa, why would the witch want to make explosions?

05:08:46.260 --> 05:08:47.260
Why not?

05:08:47.260 --> 05:08:51.260
The first bang wakes me up and then I lie awake waiting for the second one,

05:08:51.260 --> 05:08:53.260
which might not come at all.

05:08:53.260 --> 05:08:55.260
The bangs might not come from Woman Valley at all,

05:08:55.260 --> 05:08:58.260
and they might be just an echo of the mountains.

05:08:58.260 --> 05:08:59.260
You think so?

05:08:59.260 --> 05:09:00.260
Yes, I do.

05:09:00.260 --> 05:09:02.260
Well, at least that's what Snuffkin thinks.

05:09:02.260 --> 05:09:04.260
Explosions might come from the sea.

05:09:04.260 --> 05:09:05.260
That's what Snuffkin figured.

05:09:05.260 --> 05:09:09.260
He thought it might be pirates or something making the noises.

05:09:09.260 --> 05:09:12.260
He's already had pirates and they went a long time ago.

05:09:12.260 --> 05:09:15.260
I'm plumping for the witch. There's no doubt in my mouth.

05:09:15.260 --> 05:09:17.260
Goodness, what are you doing out here?

05:09:17.260 --> 05:09:19.260
We're waiting for another explosion, Mama.

05:09:19.260 --> 05:09:21.260
You'll wait in vain, dear.

05:09:21.260 --> 05:09:23.260
You know that moment, Mama.

05:09:23.260 --> 05:09:25.260
Well, we had two explosions last night,

05:09:25.260 --> 05:09:29.260
and we've never had double explosions for two nights in a row.

05:09:29.260 --> 05:09:31.260
Until now, that is.

05:09:31.260 --> 05:09:34.260
You heard that. It clearly came from over there.

05:09:34.260 --> 05:09:35.260
Over there?

05:09:35.260 --> 05:09:38.260
Oh, no. It certainly came from over there.

05:09:38.260 --> 05:09:41.260
You couldn't mistake it. I'm sure of it.

05:09:54.260 --> 05:09:56.260
Good morning, Moomin, lovely day.

05:09:56.260 --> 05:09:57.260
Good morning, Snuffkin.

05:09:57.260 --> 05:09:58.260
You look very sleepy.

05:09:58.260 --> 05:10:02.260
So would you be opposed to explosions that kept you awake for most of the night?

05:10:02.260 --> 05:10:05.260
Those explosions are really very odd, aren't they?

05:10:05.260 --> 05:10:09.260
They certainly are. Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?

05:10:09.260 --> 05:10:13.260
Moomin, Papa's convinced that she's the one who's making the bangs.

05:10:13.260 --> 05:10:14.260
I think he's wrong there.

05:10:14.260 --> 05:10:18.260
That's what I thought, but there's nothing I could say to convince him.

05:10:18.260 --> 05:10:21.260
So now I'm going to find out for myself.

05:10:21.260 --> 05:10:25.260
You can certainly ask her, but do you really trust a witch to tell you the truth?

05:10:26.260 --> 05:10:28.260
Do you, Moomin?

05:10:28.260 --> 05:10:31.260
But witches don't have to lie, Shirley.

05:10:39.260 --> 05:10:41.260
Is that you, Little My?

05:10:43.260 --> 05:10:45.260
And where are you two going?

05:10:45.260 --> 05:10:46.260
Little My.

05:10:46.260 --> 05:10:48.260
Are you tailing me full-time or what?

05:10:48.260 --> 05:10:51.260
Yes, whenever you're sneaking off somewhere.

05:10:51.260 --> 05:10:53.260
I'm not sneaking. I'm just walking.

05:10:54.260 --> 05:10:57.260
Well, I've never seen anyone walking in such a sneaky way.

05:11:02.260 --> 05:11:06.260
Last time the witch tried to keep you from waking up, didn't she?

05:11:06.260 --> 05:11:10.260
So, so you think now she's trying to keep you from sleeping?

05:11:10.260 --> 05:11:14.260
Well, if she makes the explosions, it's always possible that someone else is the target.

05:11:14.260 --> 05:11:20.260
We know very little about witches, and those bangs are probably nothing to do with the movements.

05:11:21.260 --> 05:11:24.260
I think you guessed right, but try telling that to the movements.

05:11:24.260 --> 05:11:26.260
We don't think it's like that at all.

05:11:32.260 --> 05:11:34.260
Wonder if she's at home.

05:11:34.260 --> 05:11:36.260
If she isn't, we can visit Alicia instead.

05:11:36.260 --> 05:11:38.260
Better ask Alicia than the witch.

05:11:38.260 --> 05:11:40.260
Anyway, she's more likely to tell us the truth.

05:11:40.260 --> 05:11:42.260
Yes, you're right.

05:11:46.260 --> 05:11:47.260
Uh-oh!

05:11:51.260 --> 05:11:54.260
Look, you don't seem to realize this is a witch's house.

05:11:54.260 --> 05:11:56.260
What do you mean by that?

05:11:56.260 --> 05:12:01.260
I'll tell you what I mean. What I mean is, I don't want to be seen talking with goody-goodies like the moments.

05:12:01.260 --> 05:12:05.260
You think they'll ruin your reputation, is that why you're so worried?

05:12:08.260 --> 05:12:12.260
Uh, there's just something very important we wanted to ask you.

05:12:12.260 --> 05:12:14.260
And then we'll leave straight away.

05:12:21.260 --> 05:12:23.260
That room upstairs, is that Alicia's?

05:12:23.260 --> 05:12:25.260
It is.

05:12:25.260 --> 05:12:27.260
Is Alicia there now?

05:12:27.260 --> 05:12:28.260
No, she isn't.

05:12:28.260 --> 05:12:29.260
Where did she go?

05:12:29.260 --> 05:12:30.260
She went to get some wolf's bang.

05:12:30.260 --> 05:12:32.260
When will she be coming back?

05:12:32.260 --> 05:12:34.260
You're not going to stop her studying.

05:12:35.260 --> 05:12:39.260
No, we wanted to ask her something about that loud noise we hear every night.

05:12:39.260 --> 05:12:41.260
Ah, that one!

05:12:41.260 --> 05:12:44.260
Hey, are you the one making the bangs?

05:12:44.260 --> 05:12:46.260
I don't make explosions.

05:12:46.260 --> 05:12:47.260
Who is it then?

05:12:47.260 --> 05:12:49.260
I really don't know.

05:12:49.260 --> 05:12:51.260
But why did you say that one then?

05:12:51.260 --> 05:12:53.260
Because the explosions bother me, too.

05:12:54.260 --> 05:12:56.260
You think they're coming from near here?

05:12:56.260 --> 05:12:59.260
I think they're coming from far away from the sea, maybe.

05:12:59.260 --> 05:13:01.260
That's what snuffkin' things, too.

05:13:01.260 --> 05:13:04.260
Any sound from the sea echoes off lonely mountain.

05:13:04.260 --> 05:13:06.260
So you think that's where it comes from?

05:13:06.260 --> 05:13:12.260
Why, as young man, a few days ago, I went all the way over to the beach to see what was happening.

05:13:12.260 --> 05:13:17.260
After a whole day's witching and casting magic spells, one needs one sleep, you know.

05:13:17.260 --> 05:13:19.260
So, what did you find them?

05:13:19.260 --> 05:13:20.260
Nothing at all.

05:13:20.260 --> 05:13:25.260
There was only one explosion that night, so when I got there on my brun, there was nothing more to see.

05:13:25.260 --> 05:13:28.260
Then we still have no idea who makes the bangs.

05:13:28.260 --> 05:13:31.260
No, and I really upset you thought it was me.

05:13:31.260 --> 05:13:36.260
When a witch creates an explosion, it doesn't sound anything like a camel cough, I can tell you.

05:13:38.260 --> 05:13:40.260
Camel cough, I like that!

05:13:47.260 --> 05:13:57.260
Thank you very much, Snork Maiden.

05:13:57.260 --> 05:14:01.260
This year I want to grow some black tulips.

05:14:01.260 --> 05:14:04.260
Is there really such a thing as a black tulip?

05:14:04.260 --> 05:14:06.260
There's such a dark red, they look black.

05:14:06.260 --> 05:14:08.260
Oh, I see.

05:14:08.260 --> 05:14:12.260
Although it wouldn't really surprise me, Snork Maiden, if there really were black ones somewhere.

05:14:12.260 --> 05:14:14.260
We must ask the hamulaneel now.

05:14:14.260 --> 05:14:16.260
Oh, yes.

05:14:17.260 --> 05:14:21.260
I know it's embarrassing, but I'm so excited I can't go to sleep at night.

05:14:21.260 --> 05:14:25.260
Oh, I have no problem going to sleep at night, but that noise wakes me up, Pamulane.

05:14:25.260 --> 05:14:26.260
What noise is that?

05:14:26.260 --> 05:14:28.260
I told you that noise.

05:14:30.260 --> 05:14:33.260
Oh, I see, you're talking about the explosion.

05:14:33.260 --> 05:14:35.260
You know anything about it, Mr. Himulane?

05:14:35.260 --> 05:14:37.260
No, nothing at all.

05:14:37.260 --> 05:14:41.260
No, those bangs are not what keeps me awake, moment papa.

05:14:41.260 --> 05:14:45.260
No, I'm waiting for reply from the botanist federation.

05:14:45.260 --> 05:14:46.260
reply?

05:14:46.260 --> 05:14:47.260
Yes.

05:14:47.260 --> 05:14:49.260
Don't you remember a few months ago?

05:14:49.260 --> 05:14:50.260
Power strange.

05:14:50.260 --> 05:14:52.260
I thought I told you about it.

05:14:52.260 --> 05:14:54.260
Well, I certainly told everyone else I know.

05:14:54.260 --> 05:14:57.260
I sent them a brand new species.

05:14:57.260 --> 05:14:58.260
New species.

05:14:58.260 --> 05:15:01.260
I'd never seen anything like it in my whole life.

05:15:01.260 --> 05:15:02.260
A new wild orchid.

05:15:02.260 --> 05:15:05.260
I'm so excited I can hardly speak.

05:15:05.260 --> 05:15:06.260
Really?

05:15:06.260 --> 05:15:07.260
A new wild orchid?

05:15:07.260 --> 05:15:09.260
How very interesting.

05:15:09.260 --> 05:15:10.260
Yes, isn't it?

05:15:10.260 --> 05:15:13.260
Oh, it would be such a great honor for me and for everyone else.

05:15:13.260 --> 05:15:16.260
They call it orchidaca amulensis or amuliformis.

05:15:16.260 --> 05:15:18.260
No, I'm sure they will.

05:15:18.260 --> 05:15:22.260
So now you understand why I've had so many sleepless nights.

05:15:22.260 --> 05:15:24.260
Yes, indeed.

05:15:24.260 --> 05:15:26.260
Trouble is they should have answered by now.

05:15:26.260 --> 05:15:29.260
Maybe they're still trying to decide what to call it.

05:15:29.260 --> 05:15:32.260
Maybe they can't decide between orchidaca amulensis

05:15:32.260 --> 05:15:35.260
and orchidaca amuliformis.

05:15:35.260 --> 05:15:36.260
Mmm.

05:15:36.260 --> 05:15:37.260
Oh.

05:15:37.260 --> 05:15:39.260
What is it?

05:15:39.260 --> 05:15:42.260
Now I see, at last I understand.

05:15:42.260 --> 05:15:45.260
I am getting no reply from the botanist federation

05:15:45.260 --> 05:15:48.260
because it is not a new species.

05:15:48.260 --> 05:15:50.260
Oh, of course.

05:15:50.260 --> 05:15:52.260
Somebody's already found it.

05:15:52.260 --> 05:15:53.260
Oh.

05:15:53.260 --> 05:15:56.260
This is too much money.

05:15:56.260 --> 05:15:57.260
No, no.

05:15:57.260 --> 05:15:59.260
Stupid I am.

05:15:59.260 --> 05:16:03.260
This is the end of me as a scientist, of course.

05:16:03.260 --> 05:16:06.260
Calm down, don't upset yourself, Mr. Himmel.

05:16:06.260 --> 05:16:10.260
Everybody will laugh at me and call me Mr. Amulensis.

05:16:11.260 --> 05:16:13.260
Now listen, Mr. Himmel.

05:16:13.260 --> 05:16:16.260
The reply is a long time coming because they must examine

05:16:16.260 --> 05:16:19.260
your plant most carefully before making a decision.

05:16:19.260 --> 05:16:22.260
They must read all the books first to be sure.

05:16:24.260 --> 05:16:27.260
You really think so, Mum and Patna?

05:16:27.260 --> 05:16:29.260
Could it really take so long, do you think?

05:16:29.260 --> 05:16:31.260
Of course, these things take time.

05:16:31.260 --> 05:16:33.260
When did you send it off?

05:16:33.260 --> 05:16:35.260
A month ago.

05:16:35.260 --> 05:16:37.260
There you are, that's no time at all.

05:16:37.260 --> 05:16:39.260
You have to learn to be patient, Himmel.

05:16:39.260 --> 05:16:40.260
You think so?

05:16:40.260 --> 05:16:42.260
Oh, I feel better already.

05:16:42.260 --> 05:16:45.260
Oh, I'm so glad you feel happier, Mr. Himmel.

05:16:45.260 --> 05:16:47.260
Don't you worry, my friend.

05:16:47.260 --> 05:16:49.260
Mama, great news dear.

05:16:49.260 --> 05:16:51.260
Mr. Himmelens discovered a completely new plant

05:16:51.260 --> 05:16:54.260
and is going to be called Himmelensis.

05:16:54.260 --> 05:16:56.260
Oh, that's wonderful.

05:16:56.260 --> 05:16:58.260
Congratulations, Mr. Himmel.

05:16:58.260 --> 05:17:00.260
Oh, well, it isn't official yet.

05:17:00.260 --> 05:17:03.260
No, they're just thinking about the name still.

05:17:03.260 --> 05:17:05.260
Give them time.

05:17:05.260 --> 05:17:08.260
We should have a party for Mr. Himmel and shouldn't we, Papa?

05:17:08.260 --> 05:17:09.260
What?

05:17:09.260 --> 05:17:11.260
Oh, yes, indeed.

05:17:11.260 --> 05:17:13.260
When, Papa, tonight?

05:17:13.260 --> 05:17:15.260
Let me think.

05:17:15.260 --> 05:17:18.260
We should wait just a little bit longer, perhaps.

05:17:18.260 --> 05:17:20.260
Oh, why do you say that?

05:17:20.260 --> 05:17:23.260
Mr. Himmelens, you know that rare plant you found?

05:17:23.260 --> 05:17:25.260
Does it have any flowers?

05:17:25.260 --> 05:17:26.260
But, of course.

05:17:26.260 --> 05:17:27.260
Are they pretty?

05:17:27.260 --> 05:17:29.260
Very pretty.

05:17:29.260 --> 05:17:32.260
Yes, just like you, Snork Maiden.

05:17:32.260 --> 05:17:34.260
Oh, Mr. Himmelens.

05:17:35.260 --> 05:17:37.260
Hey, look, Snork Maiden.

05:17:37.260 --> 05:17:40.260
Why don't we go and find out about those explosions tonight, huh?

05:17:40.260 --> 05:17:41.260
All right.

05:17:41.260 --> 05:17:43.260
You'll need me to find the way.

05:17:43.260 --> 05:17:44.260
You want to come along?

05:17:44.260 --> 05:17:45.260
You bet.

05:17:45.260 --> 05:17:47.260
They come later tonight.

05:17:47.260 --> 05:17:49.260
I won't go to sleep, bad.

05:17:49.260 --> 05:17:51.260
What do you think, Snork Maiden?

05:17:51.260 --> 05:17:52.260
I'm not sure.

05:17:52.260 --> 05:17:54.260
Isn't there anything you can do to change your mind, Moomin?

05:17:54.260 --> 05:17:55.260
I don't know.

05:17:55.260 --> 05:17:56.260
Listen, little Maiden.

05:17:56.260 --> 05:17:57.260
You have to be careful.

05:17:57.260 --> 05:17:59.260
This could be good.

05:17:59.260 --> 05:18:02.260
I'm not sure, isn't there anything you can do to change your mind, Moomin?

05:18:02.260 --> 05:18:03.260
You have to be careful.

05:18:03.260 --> 05:18:05.260
This could be dangerous.

05:18:05.260 --> 05:18:07.260
Obviously, or I wouldn't come.

05:18:07.260 --> 05:18:08.260
Would I spoil my sleep?

05:18:08.260 --> 05:18:10.260
Well, stick close to us then.

05:18:10.260 --> 05:18:11.260
Yes, do that.

05:18:11.260 --> 05:18:15.260
I also went down to the beach late last night to try and find out what was happening.

05:18:15.260 --> 05:18:19.260
And while I was there, I saw the witch flying around on her broomstick.

05:18:19.260 --> 05:18:20.260
Oh, really?

05:18:20.260 --> 05:18:22.260
Why didn't you tell me so I could have come along?

05:18:22.260 --> 05:18:24.260
I could hide better than you.

05:18:24.260 --> 05:18:25.260
You're so white.

05:18:25.260 --> 05:18:26.260
See, Moomin?

05:18:26.260 --> 05:18:29.260
I'm not big in white like you.

05:18:29.260 --> 05:18:31.260
Oh, there's someone coming.

05:18:31.260 --> 05:18:32.260
Who?

05:18:36.260 --> 05:18:37.260
It's Alicia.

05:18:37.260 --> 05:18:38.260
Hi, Alicia.

05:18:38.260 --> 05:18:39.260
Hi, Alicia.

05:18:39.260 --> 05:18:41.260
Oh, Moomin.

05:18:41.260 --> 05:18:43.260
Hello, Alicia.

05:18:43.260 --> 05:18:44.260
How are you?

05:18:44.260 --> 05:18:47.260
Have you three come here to play with me?

05:18:47.260 --> 05:18:50.260
No, I'm afraid we have, but it's good to see you.

05:18:50.260 --> 05:18:51.260
Yes, Alicia.

05:18:51.260 --> 05:18:52.260
Yes?

05:18:52.260 --> 05:18:55.260
Has your grandmother been kind to you since your last visit to us?

05:18:55.260 --> 05:18:56.260
Very kind.

05:18:56.260 --> 05:18:58.260
She's been treating me very well.

05:18:58.260 --> 05:19:00.260
Ever since I stopped coming to see you?

05:19:00.260 --> 05:19:01.260
Oh, good.

05:19:01.260 --> 05:19:03.260
But we don't miss you, Alicia.

05:19:03.260 --> 05:19:04.260
Oh, I miss you, too.

05:19:04.260 --> 05:19:06.260
But I must keep my promise to her.

05:19:06.260 --> 05:19:08.260
She'd be upset if I broke it.

05:19:08.260 --> 05:19:09.260
What are these wings?

05:19:09.260 --> 05:19:10.260
They're herbs.

05:19:10.260 --> 05:19:12.260
Herbs are very important for a witch.

05:19:12.260 --> 05:19:16.260
And frogs, bellies, and lizard's tails, they're important, too, of course.

05:19:16.260 --> 05:19:18.260
I think that's licorice.

05:19:18.260 --> 05:19:19.260
That's right.

05:19:19.260 --> 05:19:20.260
Very clever, Snuffkin.

05:19:20.260 --> 05:19:22.260
We use that for heartburn and coughs.

05:19:22.260 --> 05:19:24.260
The taste smells quite nice.

05:19:24.260 --> 05:19:27.260
And it also stops cows from giving their milk.

05:19:27.260 --> 05:19:28.260
I see.

05:19:28.260 --> 05:19:29.260
That's interesting.

05:19:31.260 --> 05:19:34.260
Oh, keeps my promise.

05:19:34.260 --> 05:19:36.260
I love you, thanks.

05:19:51.260 --> 05:19:53.260
Oh, it's a ride.

05:19:53.260 --> 05:19:55.260
Hello, Mr Hail.

05:19:55.260 --> 05:19:56.260
Mr. Ann Hehman.

05:19:56.260 --> 05:19:57.260
Splendid days.

05:19:57.260 --> 05:19:59.260
Hello, Mr. Ann Bellin.

05:19:59.260 --> 05:20:00.860
I work so hard.

05:20:00.860 --> 05:20:02.860
Yeah, I guess I do with that.

05:20:05.060 --> 05:20:07.060
Wait, stop.

05:20:07.060 --> 05:20:09.060
What is it, Mr. Hemuellen?

05:20:09.060 --> 05:20:11.860
My letter. I just want my letter.

05:20:11.860 --> 05:20:13.260
There isn't one.

05:20:13.260 --> 05:20:14.460
But why not?

05:20:14.460 --> 05:20:17.360
You didn't have any yesterday or the day before.

05:20:17.360 --> 05:20:20.960
Yeah, I know that. Nobody's written to you. That's why.

05:20:20.960 --> 05:20:22.560
Well, somebody should have written.

05:20:22.560 --> 05:20:26.160
Are you quite, quite sure that you've gone through your bag properly?

05:20:26.160 --> 05:20:30.060
Don't you know I'm expecting an important letter from an important scientist.

05:20:30.060 --> 05:20:31.660
It must be in your bag.

05:20:31.660 --> 05:20:34.160
Ah, alright then. Go ahead.

05:20:34.160 --> 05:20:34.760
What?

05:20:34.760 --> 05:20:38.360
Well, you don't seem to trust me to do my job properly, Mr. Hemuellen.

05:20:38.360 --> 05:20:41.160
Go ahead and have a look for yourself then.

05:20:41.160 --> 05:20:43.660
Oh, but of course I trust you. Sorry.

05:20:43.660 --> 05:20:45.760
No, no. You better have a look.

05:20:45.760 --> 05:20:46.860
What do you think I do?

05:20:46.860 --> 05:20:49.260
Steam them open and read them at night?

05:20:49.260 --> 05:20:50.460
No.

05:20:50.460 --> 05:20:53.860
Oh, you seem to have a lot of letters today.

05:20:54.860 --> 05:20:58.860
Oh, I really think I should ask for a higher salary.

05:20:58.860 --> 05:21:00.360
I deserve it.

05:21:02.860 --> 05:21:04.860
I'm just starving.

05:21:04.860 --> 05:21:08.360
I might have to go over and visit the moments in a minute.

05:21:16.360 --> 05:21:19.360
I'm sleepy too. I could go on sleeping.

05:21:19.860 --> 05:21:21.860
Oh!

05:21:21.860 --> 05:21:23.860
What do you think you're doing?

05:21:23.860 --> 05:21:27.360
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

05:21:27.360 --> 05:21:30.860
Hmm? There's nothing else out here and you didn't see me?

05:21:30.860 --> 05:21:32.360
I'm sorry.

05:21:32.360 --> 05:21:34.860
Oh dear. What does this matter with you?

05:21:34.860 --> 05:21:37.360
Is this place called Moomin Valley?

05:21:37.360 --> 05:21:39.360
Yes. That's right.

05:21:39.360 --> 05:21:43.360
At last, I found it. I never thought I'd really make it.

05:21:43.360 --> 05:21:46.360
Excuse me. Are you alright?

05:21:46.360 --> 05:21:48.360
Doctor me, miss.

05:21:48.360 --> 05:21:51.360
No, tell me what's bothering you.

05:21:51.360 --> 05:21:54.360
Oh, she's ill. She's got a fever.

05:21:54.360 --> 05:21:56.360
Please leave me alone.

05:21:56.360 --> 05:22:00.360
But you can lie here. You should be in bed, young lady.

05:22:00.360 --> 05:22:02.860
Do you know a man called Hamilton?

05:22:02.860 --> 05:22:06.360
Yes. Have you walked all the way to Moomin Valley to visit him?

05:22:06.360 --> 05:22:10.360
So I have come to the right place. He does live here.

05:22:10.360 --> 05:22:12.860
Oh, yes. He lives very close to here.

05:22:12.860 --> 05:22:16.860
I'm so glad I must see him immediately.

05:22:16.860 --> 05:22:19.860
Oh, what shall I do? I must do something.

05:22:19.860 --> 05:22:22.860
Come here, someone. Someone help me.

05:22:22.860 --> 05:22:24.860
Oh, my goodness.

05:22:26.860 --> 05:22:32.860
Help! Anyone help! Help me somebody!

05:22:43.860 --> 05:22:45.860
Papa! Papa!

05:22:45.860 --> 05:22:48.860
He's up in the guest room. If you want him, mom is there as well.

05:22:48.860 --> 05:22:50.860
What for?

05:22:50.860 --> 05:22:52.860
I just rescued a girl, you know.

05:22:52.860 --> 05:22:53.860
A girl?

05:22:53.860 --> 05:22:54.860
Did you sniff?

05:22:54.860 --> 05:22:58.860
That's right. Very pretty, too. She's ill and I put her to bed myself.

05:22:58.860 --> 05:23:00.860
I'm going to see her.

05:23:00.860 --> 05:23:02.860
Me, too.

05:23:02.860 --> 05:23:06.860
I want another look as well.

05:23:06.860 --> 05:23:09.860
First, we must bring her fever down.

05:23:09.860 --> 05:23:11.860
I think you're right.

05:23:12.860 --> 05:23:14.860
Yes?

05:23:16.860 --> 05:23:18.860
Sniff just told us about her.

05:23:18.860 --> 05:23:20.860
Oh, dear. Is she unconscious?

05:23:20.860 --> 05:23:21.860
Yes.

05:23:21.860 --> 05:23:22.860
Where'd she come from?

05:23:22.860 --> 05:23:26.860
We don't know a little, Maya, but Sniff said she'd come here to visit the hemeland.

05:23:26.860 --> 05:23:29.860
That's right. Snort Maidens gone to get him.

05:23:29.860 --> 05:23:31.860
She's pretty, isn't she?

05:23:31.860 --> 05:23:33.860
You're right. Very.

05:23:33.860 --> 05:23:36.860
By the way, Moomin, what did the witch say?

05:23:36.860 --> 05:23:40.860
Oh, dear. I thought I'd really run like this.

05:23:40.860 --> 05:23:42.860
She's missing her young girl.

05:23:42.860 --> 05:23:45.860
Well, if she's sick, why don't you give her some medicine?

05:23:45.860 --> 05:23:47.860
I don't know any young girls apart from her.

05:23:47.860 --> 05:23:49.860
Don't. Just keep running.

05:23:55.860 --> 05:23:58.860
I told you. I do not know this person.

05:23:58.860 --> 05:23:59.860
Maybe she's changed.

05:23:59.860 --> 05:24:01.860
I've already told you.

05:24:01.860 --> 05:24:03.860
I have never known any young girls.

05:24:03.860 --> 05:24:07.860
Then why do you think she'd want to come to visit you, Hamilton?

05:24:07.860 --> 05:24:09.860
She's a botanist.

05:24:09.860 --> 05:24:14.860
And obviously, she's heard of me and wants to come and see the famous hemeland for herself.

05:24:14.860 --> 05:24:17.860
Oh, dear. She can tell us when she wakes up.

05:24:17.860 --> 05:24:20.860
We must leave her now so that grandma's medicine can work.

05:24:26.860 --> 05:24:28.860
I think I'll be getting home.

05:24:28.860 --> 05:24:30.860
Oh, we couldn't let you go just like that.

05:24:30.860 --> 05:24:32.860
Please, stay and have some tea with us.

05:24:32.860 --> 05:24:35.860
Thank you, but no, I have some plans to press.

05:24:35.860 --> 05:24:38.860
And you're sure you're quite sure you don't know this girl?

05:24:38.860 --> 05:24:40.860
Absolutely certain.

05:24:40.860 --> 05:24:42.860
I really must go.

05:24:45.860 --> 05:24:48.860
I'd forgotten all about the bangs.

05:24:48.860 --> 05:24:50.860
Well, we haven't snuffed Ken and I.

05:24:50.860 --> 05:24:51.860
I'm going to look for them tonight.

05:24:51.860 --> 05:24:53.860
I'd like to come too, but I can't.

05:24:53.860 --> 05:24:55.860
I'm going with them.

05:24:55.860 --> 05:24:56.860
Are you snort maiden?

05:24:56.860 --> 05:24:59.860
You'll be hiding on the beach in the middle of the night?

05:24:59.860 --> 05:25:03.860
Yes. And then we'll rush off to where the bangs are coming from as soon as we hear them.

05:25:03.860 --> 05:25:04.860
That's the plan.

05:25:04.860 --> 05:25:06.860
Oh, I'd really love to come.

05:25:06.860 --> 05:25:08.860
I'd rather go to bed.

05:25:08.860 --> 05:25:11.860
I'd be a bit scared of the beach in the middle of the night.

05:25:11.860 --> 05:25:14.860
After all, it's my duty to stay here with movement mama.

05:25:14.860 --> 05:25:16.860
Are you coming, sniff?

05:25:16.860 --> 05:25:18.860
Certainly not. Not me.

05:25:22.860 --> 05:25:24.860
It just occurred to me that's why she's here.

05:25:24.860 --> 05:25:25.860
Oh.

05:25:37.860 --> 05:25:39.860
Here, you better take this movement.

05:25:39.860 --> 05:25:41.860
You might get very hungry.

05:25:41.860 --> 05:25:42.860
Oh, thank you, mama.

05:25:42.860 --> 05:25:45.860
A midnight snack. I really envy you.

05:25:45.860 --> 05:25:48.860
Well, then, Papa. Why don't you come with us?

05:25:48.860 --> 05:25:52.860
Oh, there's nothing I'd love more, but I'd better not tonight. Right, mama?

05:25:52.860 --> 05:25:54.860
Oh, definitely not.

05:25:54.860 --> 05:25:58.860
What would I do if something happened to the girl while you were away?

05:25:58.860 --> 05:25:59.860
Exactly.

05:25:59.860 --> 05:26:02.860
All right, Papa. We'll find out about the bangs for you.

05:26:02.860 --> 05:26:04.860
Thank you, mama.

05:26:07.860 --> 05:26:08.860
Mmm.

05:26:10.860 --> 05:26:11.860
Mmm.

05:26:11.860 --> 05:26:13.860
Mmm.

05:26:13.860 --> 05:26:15.860
Mmm. Good.

05:26:15.860 --> 05:26:17.860
I think we should save this food for a while.

05:26:17.860 --> 05:26:20.860
We might have to wait a long time for the explosions.

05:26:20.860 --> 05:26:22.860
And they might not come tonight.

05:26:22.860 --> 05:26:25.860
Stop stuffing yourself, Moon, and the rest is for a snuck in and me.

05:26:25.860 --> 05:26:27.860
But you can't eat anymore?

05:26:27.860 --> 05:26:31.860
Yes, I can. We must share it in equal parts, otherwise it's not fair.

05:26:31.860 --> 05:26:34.860
I think it should be shared in proportion to how big one is.

05:26:37.860 --> 05:26:38.860
Mmm.

05:26:38.860 --> 05:26:39.860
Mmm.

05:26:43.860 --> 05:26:45.860
Mmm.

05:26:48.860 --> 05:26:50.860
Mmm.

05:26:58.860 --> 05:26:59.860
Mmm.

05:27:03.860 --> 05:27:05.860
Uh, where are the fingerprints?

05:27:05.860 --> 05:27:14.860
to see. Keep a sharp look out. Look over there. What is it?

05:27:20.860 --> 05:27:24.860
That's what I call fireworks.

05:27:26.860 --> 05:27:30.860
Come on. Somebody must be out there in a boat.

05:27:36.860 --> 05:27:40.860
There's a boat.

05:27:41.860 --> 05:27:46.860
The fireworks must have come from there. Hey, come ashore!

05:27:47.860 --> 05:27:53.860
Is that the hemuline you think? No, I don't think so. It looks like him, but he was much younger.

05:27:54.860 --> 05:28:02.860
And so as a result of their excursion to the beach, they finally learned that the big bangs that had been waking everyone up were fireworks.

05:28:02.860 --> 05:28:07.860
They also learned that the fireworks were coming from a boat far out to sea.

05:28:08.860 --> 05:28:12.860
But the man who had sent them up disappeared into the night.

05:28:32.860 --> 05:28:49.860
The Moons are having fun day after day. The Moons. The Moons. The Moons.
