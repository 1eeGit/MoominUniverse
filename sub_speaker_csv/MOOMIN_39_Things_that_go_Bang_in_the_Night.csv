67000,68000,"What?",55500,57200,"SPEAKER_00"
68000,80900,"Big explosions could be heard in Moomin Valley almost every night, and Moomin couldn't sleep",55500,57200,"SPEAKER_00"

99760,101960,"They seem to be coming from the north.",99700,101400,"SPEAKER_04"
101960,103680,"Hmm, he's sti-thought.",101800,103500,"SPEAKER_18"
103680,105800,"Or they could be coming from lonely mountains.",103600,105800,"SPEAKER_04"
105800,109360,"If you ask me, I believe they're the work of the witch.",105800,109100,"SPEAKER_18"
109360,110360,"The witch?",109100,112300,"SPEAKER_04"
110360,112560,"But witches don't make a lot of noise.",109100,112300,"SPEAKER_04"

124800,129320,"The first bang wakes me up, and then I lie awake waiting for the second one, which might",124000,130600,"SPEAKER_18"

130920,134760,"The bags might not come from Moomin Valley at all, and they might be just an echo off",130800,135600,"SPEAKER_04"

136760,137760,"Yes, I do.",136300,139500,"SPEAKER_04"
137760,139520,"Well, at least that's what Snuffkin thinks.",136300,139500,"SPEAKER_04"
139520,141800,"And the explosions might come from the sea.",139200,141600,"SPEAKER_18"
141800,143280,"That's what Snuffkin figured.",141600,146500,"SPEAKER_04"
143280,146360,"He thought it might be pirates or something making the noises.",141600,146500,"SPEAKER_04"

152560,154080,"What are you doing out here?",152400,154200,"SPEAKER_04"

160480,164720,"Well, we had two explosions last night, and we've never had double explosions for two",156700,156700,"SPEAKER_18"
160480,164720,"Well, we had two explosions last night, and we've never had double explosions for two",156700,165800,"SPEAKER_16"

169560,170560,"You heard that.",169400,172200,"SPEAKER_18"
170560,171960,"It clearly came from over there.",169400,172200,"SPEAKER_18"

172960,173960,"Oh, no.",172000,175300,"SPEAKER_16"
173960,176320,"It certainly came from over there.",172000,175300,"SPEAKER_16"
176320,177760,"You couldn't mistake it.",172000,175300,"SPEAKER_16"

193840,195280,"Good morning, Snuffkin.",192500,194000,"SPEAKER_13"
195280,196760,"You look very sleepy.",195200,196600,"SPEAKER_13"
196760,200960,"So would you be opposed to explosions that kept you awake for most of the night?",196200,200300,"SPEAKER_04"
200960,203280,"Those explosions are really very hard, aren't they?",200800,203400,"SPEAKER_13"
203280,204760,"They certainly are.",200800,203400,"SPEAKER_13"
204760,207760,"Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?",203500,211200,"SPEAKER_04"
207760,211040,"Moomin, Papa's convinced that she's the one who's making the bangs.",203500,211200,"SPEAKER_04"
211040,212540,"I think he's wrong there.",203500,211200,"SPEAKER_04"
212540,216040,"That's what I thought, but there's nothing I could say to convince him.",211200,212800,"SPEAKER_13"
216040,219040,"So now I'm going to find out for myself.",212900,218900,"SPEAKER_04"
219040,223040,"You can certainly ask her, but do you really trust a witch to tell you the truth?",212900,218900,"SPEAKER_04"
225040,226040,"Do you, a woman?",219200,223100,"SPEAKER_13"
226040,229040,"But witches don't have to lie, Shirley.",225300,226100,"SPEAKER_13"
237040,239040,"Is that you, Little My?",236600,236700,"SPEAKER_14"
241040,243040,"And where are you two going?",237600,238700,"SPEAKER_13"
243040,244040,"Little My.",241300,254900,"SPEAKER_04"
244040,247040,"Are you tailing me full time or what?",241300,254900,"SPEAKER_04"
247040,252040,"Yes, whenever you're sneaking off somewhere, I'm not sneaking, I'm just walking.",241300,254900,"SPEAKER_04"
252040,255040,"Well, I've never seen anyone walking in such a sneaky way.",241300,254900,"SPEAKER_04"
260040,264040,"Last time the witch tried to keep you from waking up, didn't she?",259800,267800,"SPEAKER_04"
264040,265040,"So?",259800,267800,"SPEAKER_04"
265040,268040,"So you think now she's trying to keep you from sleeping?",259800,267800,"SPEAKER_04"
268040,272040,"Well, if she makes the explosions, it's always possible that someone else is the target.",259800,267800,"SPEAKER_04"
272040,277040,"We know very little about witches, and those bangs are probably nothing to do with the movements.",268200,277300,"SPEAKER_13"
278040,282040,"I think you guessed right, but try telling that to the movements.",268200,277300,"SPEAKER_13"
282040,284040,"We don't think it's like that at all.",282000,285300,"SPEAKER_04"
290040,292040,"Wonder if she's at home.",285500,287600,"SPEAKER_04"
292040,294040,"If she isn't, we can visit Alicia instead.",290500,294300,"SPEAKER_04"
294040,296040,"Better ask Alicia than the witch.",290500,294300,"SPEAKER_04"
296040,298040,"Anyway, she's more likely to tell us the truth.",294500,298400,"SPEAKER_13"
298040,300040,"Yes, you're right.",294500,298400,"SPEAKER_13"
308040,311040,"Look, you don't seem to realize this is a witch's house.",305000,305000,"SPEAKER_02"
308040,311040,"Look, you don't seem to realize this is a witch's house.",305000,305000,"SPEAKER_04"
311040,313040,"What do you mean by that?",308600,311500,"SPEAKER_02"
313040,315040,"I'll tell you what I mean.",313000,313100,"SPEAKER_02"
315040,319040,"What I mean is, I don't want to be seen talking with goody-goodies like the moments.",313900,319200,"SPEAKER_02"
319040,323040,"You think they'll ruin your reputation, is that why you're so worried?",313900,319200,"SPEAKER_02"
323040,324040,"Hmm.",322800,322900,"SPEAKER_04"
326040,330040,"Uh, there's just something very important we wanted to ask you.",323300,323700,"SPEAKER_14"
330040,332040,"And then we'll leave straight away.",326900,329800,"SPEAKER_04"
338040,341040,"That room upstairs, is that Alicia's?",330100,332000,"SPEAKER_04"
341040,342040,"It is.",338600,341000,"SPEAKER_04"
342040,344040,"Is Alicia there now?",342000,342000,"SPEAKER_04"
344040,345040,"No, she isn't.",342800,344200,"SPEAKER_04"
345040,346040,"Where did she go?",344600,351300,"SPEAKER_02"
346040,348040,"She went to get some wolf's vein.",344600,351300,"SPEAKER_02"
348040,349040,"When will she be coming back?",344600,351300,"SPEAKER_02"
349040,351040,"You're not going to stop her studying.",344600,351300,"SPEAKER_02"
352040,357040,"No, we wanted to ask her something about that loud noise we hear every night.",344600,351300,"SPEAKER_02"
357040,359040,"Ah, that one.",352800,357300,"SPEAKER_04"
359040,361040,"Hey, are you the one making the bangs?",358200,358900,"SPEAKER_02"
361040,364040,"I don't make explosions.",359100,361500,"SPEAKER_04"
364040,365040,"Who is it then?",362700,364100,"SPEAKER_02"
365040,366040,"I really don't know.",364300,365300,"SPEAKER_04"
366040,368040,"But why did you say that one then?",365500,366600,"SPEAKER_04"
368040,370040,"Because the explosions bother me, too.",366900,370800,"SPEAKER_04"
372040,374040,"You think they're coming from near here?",366900,370800,"SPEAKER_04"
374040,377040,"I think they're coming from far away from the sea, maybe.",372600,376800,"SPEAKER_04"
377040,379040,"That's what snuffkin' things, too.",377000,378900,"SPEAKER_04"
379040,382040,"Any sound from the sea echoes off Lonely Mountain,",377000,378900,"SPEAKER_04"
382040,384040,"so you think that's where it comes from?",379300,384500,"SPEAKER_13"
384040,386040,"Why is young man, a few days ago,",379300,384500,"SPEAKER_13"
386040,389040,"I went all the way over to the beach to see what was happening.",385900,394800,"SPEAKER_02"
389040,392040,"After a whole day's witching and casting magic spells,",385900,394800,"SPEAKER_02"
392040,394040,"one needs one sleep, you know.",385900,394800,"SPEAKER_02"
394040,396040,"So, what did you find them?",385900,394800,"SPEAKER_02"
396040,397040,"Nothing at all.",395000,402200,"SPEAKER_02"
397040,399040,"There was only one explosion that night,",395000,402200,"SPEAKER_02"
399040,402040,"so when I got there on my brun, there was nothing more to see.",395000,402200,"SPEAKER_02"
402040,405040,"Then we still have no idea who makes the bangs.",395000,402200,"SPEAKER_02"
405040,408040,"No, and I'm really upset you thought it was me.",403100,414200,"SPEAKER_02"
408040,410040,"When a witch creates an explosion,",403100,414200,"SPEAKER_02"
410040,413040,"it doesn't sound anything like a camel cough.",403100,414200,"SPEAKER_02"
413040,415040,"I can tell you.",403100,414200,"SPEAKER_02"
415040,418040,"Camel cough, I like that.",403100,414200,"SPEAKER_02"
432040,435040,"Thank you very much, Snork Maiden.",419000,419000,"SPEAKER_04"
436040,439040,"This year I want to grow some black tulips.",432700,434400,"SPEAKER_16"
439040,442040,"Is there really such a thing as a black tulip?",437000,439500,"SPEAKER_16"
442040,444040,"There's such a dark red, they look black.",441200,444000,"SPEAKER_16"
444040,446040,"Oh, I see.",441200,444000,"SPEAKER_16"
446040,448040,"Although it wouldn't really surprise me, Snork Maiden,",444500,453600,"SPEAKER_16"
448040,450040,"if there really were black ones somewhere.",444500,453600,"SPEAKER_16"
450040,452040,"We must ask the hamulineal now.",444500,453600,"SPEAKER_16"
452040,454040,"Oh, yes.",444500,453600,"SPEAKER_16"
454040,457040,"I know it's embarrassing, but I'm so excited.",444500,453600,"SPEAKER_16"
457040,459040,"I can't go to sleep at night.",457000,458600,"SPEAKER_17"
459040,461040,"Oh, I have no problem going to sleep at night,",458900,466100,"SPEAKER_18"
461040,463040,"but that noise wakes me up, Pamuline.",458900,466100,"SPEAKER_18"
463040,464040,"What noise is that?",458900,466100,"SPEAKER_18"
464040,467040,"I told you that noise.",458900,466100,"SPEAKER_18"
467040,468040,"Oh, I see.",458900,466100,"SPEAKER_18"
468040,470040,"You're talking about the explosion.",467800,474000,"SPEAKER_18"
470040,473040,"You know anything about it, Mr. Hemuline.",467800,474000,"SPEAKER_18"
473040,475040,"No, nothing at all.",467800,474000,"SPEAKER_18"
475040,477040,"No, those bangs are not what keeps me awake,",474000,474700,"SPEAKER_17"
477040,479040,"moment papa.",475200,478700,"SPEAKER_17"
479040,482040,"No, I'm waiting for a pie from the botanist federation.",475200,478700,"SPEAKER_17"
482040,483040,"Reply.",479700,482800,"SPEAKER_17"
483040,486040,"Yes, don't you remember a few months ago?",482900,486500,"SPEAKER_17"
486040,489040,"Housecrange, I thought I told you about it.",482900,486500,"SPEAKER_17"
489040,492040,"Well, I certainly told everyone else I know.",487000,489700,"SPEAKER_17"
492040,495040,"I sent them a brand new species.",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
495040,496040,"New species.",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
496040,499040,"I've never seen anything like it in my whole life.",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
499040,500040,"A new wild orchid.",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
500040,503040,"I'm so excited I can hardly speak.",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
503040,504040,"Really?",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
504040,505040,"A new wild orchid.",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
505040,507040,"How very interesting.",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
507040,508040,"Yes, isn't it?",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
508040,510040,"Oh, it would be such a great honor for me",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
510040,513040,"and for everyone else that they call it orchidokahemulinesis",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
513040,514040,"or hemiliformis.",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
514040,516040,"No, I'm sure they will.",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
516040,520040,"So now you understand why I've had so many sleepless nights.",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
520040,522040,"Yes, indeed.",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
522040,524040,"Trouble is they should have answered by now.",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
524040,527040,"Maybe they're still trying to decide what to call it.",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
527040,530040,"Maybe they can't decide between orchidokahemulinesis",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"
530040,533040,"and orchidokahemuliformis.",490000,532400,"SPEAKER_17"

981040,985040,"I want another look as well.",977400,979000,"SPEAKER_03"
985040,988040,"First, we must bring her fever down.",981400,983200,"SPEAKER_03"
988040,990040,"I think you're right.",987800,988300,"SPEAKER_16"

1014040,1018040,"Oh dear, must I really run like this?",1011600,1013900,"SPEAKER_18"
1018040,1020040,"Where is she visiting her young girl?",1014100,1027500,"SPEAKER_14"

1034040,1038040,"I told you. I do not know this person. Maybe she's changed.",1034000,1039000,"SPEAKER_17"
1038040,1042040,"I've already told you. I have never known any young girls.",1034000,1039000,"SPEAKER_17"
1042040,1045040,"Then why do you think she'd want to come to visit you, hemeland?",1039000,1045000,"SPEAKER_16"
1045040,1047040,"She's a botanist.",1039000,1045000,"SPEAKER_16"
1047040,1052040,"And obviously she's heard of me and wants to come and see the famous hemeland for herself.",1045600,1045600,"SPEAKER_16"
1047040,1052040,"And obviously she's heard of me and wants to come and see the famous hemeland for herself.",1045600,1046900,"SPEAKER_17"
1052040,1055040,"Oh dear, she can tell us when she wakes up.",1052000,1058100,"SPEAKER_16"
1055040,1059040,"We must leave her now so that grandma's medicine can work.",1052000,1058100,"SPEAKER_16"
1065040,1066040,"I think I'll be getting home.",1065000,1077800,"SPEAKER_18"

1070040,1073040,"Thank you, but no, I have some plans to press.",1065000,1077800,"SPEAKER_18"
1073040,1076040,"And you're sure you're quite sure you don't know this girl?",1065000,1077800,"SPEAKER_18"
1076040,1078040,"Absolutely certain.",1065000,1077800,"SPEAKER_18"
1078040,1081040,"I really must go.",1065000,1077800,"SPEAKER_18"

1095040,1098040,"You'll be hiding on the beach in the middle of the night?",1093900,1095200,"SPEAKER_15"
1098040,1102040,"Yes, and then we'll rush off to where the bangs are coming from as soon as we hear them.",1095200,1103100,"SPEAKER_04"
1102040,1103040,"That's the plan.",1095200,1103100,"SPEAKER_04"
1103040,1105040,"Oh, I'd really love to come.",1095200,1103100,"SPEAKER_04"
1105040,1109040,"I'd rather go to bed. I'd be a bit scared of the beach in the middle of the night.",1103100,1105100,"SPEAKER_18"
1109040,1112040,"After all, it's my duty to stay here with Mum and Mama.",1105300,1105300,"SPEAKER_04"
1109040,1112040,"After all, it's my duty to stay here with Mum and Mama.",1105300,1109300,"SPEAKER_15"
1112040,1114040,"Are you coming, Sniff?",1109600,1112500,"SPEAKER_18"
1114040,1117040,"Certainly not. Not me.",1112700,1114000,"SPEAKER_15"
1120040,1123040,"This just occurred to me. That's why she's here.",1115900,1116700,"SPEAKER_03"
1123040,1125040,"Ah.",1120500,1122600,"SPEAKER_17"
1135040,1139040,"Here, you better take this moment. You might get very hungry.",1123100,1123900,"SPEAKER_17"
1139040,1141040,"Oh, thank you, Mama.",1135900,1139300,"SPEAKER_16"
1141040,1144040,"A midnight snack. I really envy you.",1139400,1140600,"SPEAKER_04"
1144040,1146040,"Well, Grandpa, why don't you come with us?",1143900,1146400,"SPEAKER_04"
1146040,1148040,"Oh, there's nothing I'd love more.",1143900,1146400,"SPEAKER_04"
1148040,1151040,"But I'd better not tonight. Right, Mama?",1146700,1151200,"SPEAKER_18"
1151040,1153040,"Oh, definitely not.",1146700,1151200,"SPEAKER_18"
1153040,1157040,"What would I do if something happened to the girl while you were away?",1151200,1157700,"SPEAKER_16"
1157040,1158040,"Exactly.",1151200,1157700,"SPEAKER_16"
1158040,1161040,"All right, Papa. We'll find out about the bangs for you.",1157700,1160900,"SPEAKER_04"
1161040,1163040,"Thank you, Momenta.",1157700,1160900,"SPEAKER_04"
1171040,1173040,"Good.",1169100,1172700,"SPEAKER_04"
1173040,1178040,"I think we should save this food for a while. We might have to wait a long time for the explosions.",1169100,1172700,"SPEAKER_04"
1178040,1180040,"Then they might not come tonight.",1173400,1178100,"SPEAKER_13"
1180040,1184040,"Stop stuffing yourself, Mum, and the rest is for a snuffkin and me.",1178300,1179900,"SPEAKER_04"
1184040,1187040,"But you can't eat anymore? Yes, I can.",1180600,1192800,"SPEAKER_04"
1187040,1190040,"We must share it in equal parts, otherwise it's not fair.",1180600,1192800,"SPEAKER_04"
1190040,1193040,"I think it should be shared in proportion to how big one is.",1180600,1192800,"SPEAKER_04"
1208040,1210040,"Hmm.",1180600,1192800,"SPEAKER_04"
1220040,1222040,"Hmm?",1220000,1220000,"SPEAKER_11"
1220040,1222040,"Hmm?",1220000,1220400,"SPEAKER_13"
1222040,1224040,"Oh, where did that come from? From the sea.",1220000,1220000,"SPEAKER_11"
1222040,1224040,"Oh, where did that come from? From the sea.",1220000,1220400,"SPEAKER_13"
1224040,1226040,"Keep a sharp lookout. Look over there.",1223300,1224000,"SPEAKER_13"
1229040,1231040,"What is it?",1225400,1226200,"SPEAKER_13"
1231040,1234040,"Uh-oh! Wow!",1229600,1230300,"SPEAKER_04"
1234040,1236040,"Oh!",1229600,1230300,"SPEAKER_04"
1239040,1241040,"That's what I call fireworks.",1238900,1240000,"SPEAKER_07"
1244040,1245040,"Come on!",1240000,1240700,"SPEAKER_04"
1245040,1247040,"Somebody must be out there in a boat!",1244700,1245200,"SPEAKER_04"
1257040,1259040,"There's a boat!",1256500,1257200,"SPEAKER_04"
1259040,1262040,"The fireworks must have come from there!",1257700,1258500,"SPEAKER_04"
1262040,1264040,"Hey! Come ashore!",1259500,1264000,"SPEAKER_04"
1265040,1267040,"Is that the henman you like?",1259500,1264000,"SPEAKER_04"
1267040,1270040,"No, I don't think so. It looks like him, but he was much younger.",1266200,1267700,"SPEAKER_04"
1271040,1280040,"And so as a result of their excursion to the beach, they finally learned that the big bangs that had been waking everyone up were fireworks.",1267700,1270700,"SPEAKER_13"
1280040,1285040,"They also learned that the fireworks were coming from a boat far out to sea.",1272400,1281000,"SPEAKER_01"
1285040,1290040,"But the man who had sent them up disappeared into the night.",1281200,1285900,"SPEAKER_01"
1291040,1299040,"They loved the laughter and they loved the living the movements.",1286200,1290300,"SPEAKER_01"
1299040,1306040,"They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.",1292500,1298100,"SPEAKER_10"
1306040,1310040,"They're always happy and goes at play.",1304700,1305300,"SPEAKER_09"
1310040,1317040,"The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.",1307200,1311200,"SPEAKER_10"
1317040,1321040,"The movements.",1311400,1317300,"SPEAKER_09"
1321040,1327040,"The movements.",1319000,1320400,"SPEAKER_09"
