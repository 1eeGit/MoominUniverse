1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
there were the movements, there were the movements.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Woman Valley is enjoying another still peaceful summer's day.

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
However, this lazy lifestyle, no matter how pleasant it might be, does not suit everyone.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, yes.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Would you like a cup of coffee, dear?

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes, I think I need one, Mama.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh dear, is it your memoirs?

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm stuck.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Ah, can I help?

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
How can I create in this?

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In what?

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In this sleepy atmosphere, and I've also come to a boring part.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
When was that?

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The time I wrote poems.

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Were they any good?

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, miss that bit out then.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I must put it down for posterity, it is my duty.

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But how can I get inspiration here in this place where nothing ever happens, nothing ever happens at all?

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, I think this means another adventure.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes, Mama, but I need it to be big, exciting, and frightening.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Mama, what's the matter?

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Are you all right?

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Your father says that because nothing ever happens here, he can't write.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So I'm looking for an adventure for him.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Can you think of anything?

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He wants it to be big, exciting, and frightening.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Does he want something really exciting?

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes, dear, I'm afraid so.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I think I could manage that.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That looks like the footprint of a huge monster.

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, it's a good feeling giving others a bit of excitement.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Just a couple more.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm praise the booboo I don't have to do modest work very often.

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Phew, that was harder than I thought.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oi, sleepy heads.

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Wake up, everybody!

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Mom and Papa, quickly get up!

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Mom and Mama, a monster!

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You've been visited by a monster!

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Wake up before you eat and alive!

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Come on, hurry, hurry!

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
My, what huge tracks.

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Ah, that should keep them guessing for a while.

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hmm, it could be a monster from the depths of the ocean.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Something's not right here.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't you think it's a bit odd that it came directly to Moome House?

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah.

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Well, look at the footsteps. They go in a straight line.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Someone must have told it to go to Moome House.

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And they're only going one way.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Look, there are tiny footsteps going back to the sea.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh, Mama, my monster must still be here then.

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, well, not necessarily.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Retracing one's own footsteps is the sign of an advanced intelligence.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Stepping back exactly the way you came.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The tough question is, why would the monster do that?

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
One is led to believe that it wants us to think it's still here.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, in fact, it has gone back to wherever it came from.

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Fiddle battle, as my dear mother would say.

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But why would it want us to think that, Papa?

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's a spy.

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, it's a spy.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Something it shouldn't.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It'd hardly be a good spy if we knew they have to sneak in and out.

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I think it's still here. I can feel it. You know what I mean?

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Perhaps tonight.

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Tonight? What about tonight?

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's when they'll attack. It's gone back to give its report.

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
How do you know that, Papa?

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, obviously, that's why it still wants us to believe it's here.

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Mama, Mama!

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes, what is it, Moome?

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Something terrible is going to happen.

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
A monster is going to attack us tonight.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And Papa's excited about it.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, good. That's nice for him.

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Hurry, everyone.

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I expect the monster will be here soon.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Now hold it still.

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is going to be a good barricade, don't you think?

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We'd better make sure it's big enough.

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's hardly any fun at all playing tricks on them. They're so gullible.

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If we catch the monster, we can sell it to a zoo.

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll handle the sale, of course.

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'd rather tame it and keep it as a pet.

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We could ride on it to go pig-nicking.

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Alright, now for the moat. Here we go.

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Hope the well's got enough water in it.

97
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It'll be able to swim in this, Papa.

98
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes, it'll remind you to the sea and keep it calm.

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This is fresh water, Papa. We'd better put some salt in it.

100
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Good idea, Moome.

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We'll plant some seaweed and put some rocks in too,

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and then it'll feel really at home.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I wonder when it'll come.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't know, but I can feel in my bones it'll be tonight.

105
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And we keep watching till it comes?

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Of course we will, constantly.

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What if it doesn't come till tomorrow night or the night after that?

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It might be a long wait, so we'll take it in turns and remember everybody.

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The safe way is to keep it calm.

110
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't know, but I can feel in my bones it'll be tonight.

111
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And we keep watching till it comes?

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We'll take it in turns and remember everybody.

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The safety of Moome in Valley relies upon our vigilance.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We must be ready.

115
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Look at what those fools have done.

116
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It was worth all the trouble.

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Look, they put down food as bait.

118
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Moome and Papa must be worn out.

119
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Well, I'll take the food anyway.

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Carefully, does it?

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't want to wake up the guard.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This is great.

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I've managed to play a really good trick on the stupid moments,

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and they've given me a slap-up meal as well.

125
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The monster's here.

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Shut the gate.

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There's the rope.

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Quickly!

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No, the house!

130
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Wake up everybody to ours!

131
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No, it's only me!

132
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Make room, I'll get it!

133
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, where is it?

134
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
There's no monster only me!

135
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Please, it's me, it's me Stinky!

136
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Stinky?

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Well, it sounds like Stinky.

138
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Be careful everybody, it's a baby monster.

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Another monster, please help me!

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I made the footprints!

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You did?

142
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He's obviously lying.

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He's too small.

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Watch him or he'll go get his daddy.

145
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
No, please, I beg you!

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Ah, Moome and Papa?

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh, hello, Snuffkin.

148
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Why don't you let Stinky go?

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It really is him, you know.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It is?

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes, it was Stinky, and he really did make those footprints.

152
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
How do you know that Snuffkin?

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I was fishing off the shore last night when I saw him digging the holes.

154
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The little rascal was at it for hours and hours.

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,360
The

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Why don't you come inside Stinky?

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This is great.

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It was very good of you to make the footprints.

159
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Papa hasn't had so much fun at ages.

160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm glad it was hard work and I lost all my hair too.

161
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, mischief isn't always easy, you know.

162
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You can say that again!

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is delicious!

164
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Papa, are you all right?

165
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes, thank you, Moome.

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Mama.

167
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes, dear?

168
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Shh, I've got something important to tell you.

169
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What is it, Papa?

170
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
A secret in my mind is made up.

171
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Of course, dear.

172
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm going to run away on an adventure trip.

173
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's nice for you.

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's a trip without a destination full of mystery,

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
hazards and hardships, and you're coming to, Mama.

176
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, splendid.

177
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Shall we take all the children or just Moome?

178
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No, no children.

179
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That would be the same as here, only somewhere else.

180
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We'll run away.

181
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Run away, Moome and Papa?

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll be an adventurer again, just as I was in my last youth.

183
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And with you by my side, we'll have adventure, romance.

184
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
All we desire, the sun, the stars.

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But what about Moonman? He'll be frantic.

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Whoa, then it's time he learned to stand on his own feet.

187
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Fan for himself. Become a man.

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We can't protect him forever, you know.

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
He's big enough to be left by himself.

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm on, Mama.

191
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh, just a moment, Papa.

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh, you can't take anything more with us.

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
No, I know, but I forgot to write down where the sugar is.

194
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If they can't find it, they'll just have to do without.

195
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But then they won't be able to make cakes and the tea will taste awful.

196
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, and they'll never find this cinnamon on them. Where shall I leave it?

197
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Goodness, Mama, cinnamon, I ask you when the unknown is calling to us.

198
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I should have gone on my own, indeed, I should.

199
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But then what good is an adventure when you can't say who?

200
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That was a close shave to someone afterwards.

201
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Is there anything wrong, Papa?

202
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No, everything is fine, but we must leave before dawn.

203
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
All right.

204
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We have a long way to go.

205
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
How far and where? It's very dark, you know.

206
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes, isn't it? We'll just follow our feet and they say this way.

207
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, God.

208
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Good morning, Mama.

209
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Mama, where are you?

210
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What's the matter, Moomin?

211
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
My parents are missing.

212
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Are you sure? Of course, I'm sure.

213
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's a bit of a problem. I'm getting hungry.

214
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I need my breakfast. I have to start the day with a good meal.

215
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm starving. Me too.

216
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Don't worry, Moomin. I'm sure that Moomin, Mama and Moomin, Papa will be back home very soon.

217
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But where could they have gone to, Snuffkin?

218
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No idea. Have they left a note?

219
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Have you had your breakfast yet, Moomin?

220
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No, nothing. It's not the shame without Mama.

221
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Cheer up, Moomin.

222
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You can have this fish.

223
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And I'll come up to Moomin house and cook it especially for you, if you like.

224
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Thanks, Snuffkin. But there are two cooks there already.

225
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Little Mayan's sniff, a bull trying to cook.

226
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
A bit of fish, a bit of fat.

227
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This is great. There's lots of delicious things I want to try out.

228
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Where are we, Papa?

229
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
No idea, Mama. Too dark to see anything at all.

230
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
We've been gone for hours. I think it should have been light by now.

231
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh, dear, we have to face it. I'm afraid we're lost. I'm sorry, Mama, but there it is.

232
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What do you mean?

233
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Well, in the dark, we must have wandered into some caves.

234
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Who knows how many different tunnels we took. It could be weeks before we find our way.

235
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Little Mayan's burning.

236
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Mind your own business. I might like burnt food. It's very nutritious. Watch your own cooking.

237
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It couldn't be any worse than the last lot you made for us.

238
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Ha! I wonder where Moomin is. He likes my food. I'll get him to try it.

239
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He can try mine first. Now that I practice, it'll be perfect.

240
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Moomin, I've got something for you.

241
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Mama!

242
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Papa!

243
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Mama!

244
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What was that?

245
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Moomin, Papa! Wake up!

246
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Moomin, Papa!

247
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Ooh!

248
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It tastes brackish. We must be quite near the sea.

249
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That's a big one.

250
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Gotcha.

251
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Moomin, Moomin, where are you so far from home?

252
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Mama, at last. Look, I've got a big fish. Come and help me quickly.

253
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't let it get away.

254
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I've never seen such a big fish movement.

255
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Just wait till Papa sees it.

256
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh, yes. Moomin, Papa. This looks familiar. It's Moomin Valley, isn't it?

257
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Of course it is, just outside the cave.

258
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh dear. I'm afraid that your father will be a bit disappointed.

259
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Where is he then?

260
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, he's gone, looking for adventure.

261
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Adventure? Where?

262
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't really know. Somewhere.

263
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I could have gone with him.

264
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
When's he coming home?

265
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm afraid I don't know that either.

266
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You know Papa tonight, tomorrow night.

267
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Next Christmas?

268
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Your guess is as good as mine, Moomin.

269
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Wow. I bet he's having a great adventure right now.

270
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Hey, Mama.

271
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh, oh.

272
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh, you...

273
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Mama?

274
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Hello, where are you?

275
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh, the cave dwellers must have her.

276
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh, Mama.

277
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Mama.

278
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Mama, oh.

279
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Can you hear me?

280
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Oh.

281
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Goodness, the sea.

282
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, this looks like...

283
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Oh, it gets...

284
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh, dear.

285
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Terry, me, I don't...

286
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Oh, well, oh, my...

287
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Oh, you see?

288
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It might have been...

289
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Oh, yeah, of course.

290
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, look, look, it's Papa.

291
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Papa's back, everyone.

292
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Uh-huh.

293
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Hi, Papa.

294
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Oh, well, I'm back.

295
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So pleased to see you again.

296
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Thank you, Mama.

297
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Papa, how was your adventure?

298
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Unexpected, yes, that's what I'd say.

299
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Unexpected, any food.

300
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Oh, yes, you can try mine.

301
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
First, Moomin, Papa.

302
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Oh, mine's the best.

303
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Try mine, Papa.

304
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh, that's good.

305
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm starving.

306
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Tell us about your adventure.

307
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I love you.

308
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Were you an mortal danger?

309
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Did you eat any rams?

310
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah, I am supposed to.

311
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I think Papa wants to talk about his adventure yet.

312
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Maybe later.

313
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And that was the end of Mama and Papa's adventure.

314
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
They didn't get far, but then you don't have to sometimes

315
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
for things to happen.

316
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Or at least for you to think they're happening.

317
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
They love the laughter,

318
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
and they love the living, the romance.

319
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

320
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
They're always happy and always at play.

321
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

322
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The movements.

323
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The movements.

324
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
They love the laughter,

325
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and they love the living, the movements.

326
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

327
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
They're always happy and always at play.

328
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

329
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The movements.

330
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The movements.

331
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The movements.

332
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
The movements.
