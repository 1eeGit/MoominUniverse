21000	29000	Here for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.
29000	36000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land.

132300	135300	The witch has come to Moomin Valley.
135300	137300	What could she be up to this time?
137300	139300	Eldris Cabalasum!
139300	140300	Eldris Cabalasum!
140300	142300	Eldris Cabalasum!
142300	143300	Eldris Cabalasum!
143300	144300	Eldris Cabalasum!
144300	146300	Eldris Cabalasum!
146300	147300	Eldris Cabalasum!
147300	148300	Eldris Cabalasum!
148300	149300	Eldris Cabalasum!
149300	150300	Eldris Cabalasum!
150300	151300	Eldris Cabalasum!
151300	152300	Eldris Cabalasum!
152300	153300	Eldris Cabalasum!
153300	154300	Eldris Cabalasum!
154300	155300	Eldris Cabalasum!
155300	156300	Oh!
158300	160300	Oh, it's snowing again.
160300	162300	I must get a covered brown.
164300	165300	Oh!
191300	193300	The great thaw had come at last.
199300	200300	The Moomin Valley.
206300	208300	I think I can smell spring!
211300	214300	Oh, I've never seen anything like this one before.
221300	223300	Hello there, Mr. Hamilton.
223300	224300	Hello, Sniff.
224300	225300	You're up early this year?
225300	226300	Yes.
226300	229300	I think I've even beat Moomin to it.
229300	230300	Is that so?
230300	232300	Why are the Moomin so late this year?
240300	241300	Moomin, wake up!
241300	242300	Spring is here!
242300	243300	It's time to wake up!
243300	244300	Moomin!
246300	248300	Maybe Snork Maiden's easier to wake up.
249300	250300	Snork Maiden!
252300	254300	And I thought I was difficult to wake up.
254300	255300	I must get closer.
266300	267300	What are you doing, Sniff?
267300	268300	What am I doing?
268300	269300	You can see, can't you?
269300	272300	Of course I can, but why are you climbing up that?
272300	274300	Moomin and Snork Maiden are still asleep.
274300	275300	I have to wake them up.
275300	276300	Why don't you go this way?
277300	278300	It's easier!
282300	284300	What are you doing?
288300	290300	Funny, even Moomin Mama's still asleep.
296300	297300	Wrong room.
300300	301300	Come on!
301300	302300	Wake up, lazy bones!
307300	309300	Moomin, spring has come!
313300	315300	We'll look at that!
315300	317300	Wake up, you sleepyhead!
317300	319300	Oh, you really are impossible!
319300	321300	Moomin, Moomin, Moomin!
321300	323300	This is odd, even for Moomin!
326300	328300	Open the window, little mind!
329300	330300	Oh, was I scared?
331300	333300	Oh, I haven't you opened them up!
333300	334300	I've tried, but they won't!
335300	336300	You're kidding!
339300	341300	No one can resist this little mind!
342300	343300	Wake up, Moomin!
343300	345300	I know you're ticklish!
347300	348300	Hmm?
348300	349300	Hmm?
349300	350300	Hmm?
350300	351300	Hmm?
351300	352300	Hmm?
352300	353300	Hmm?
353300	354300	Hmm?
354300	355300	Hmm?
355300	356300	Hmm?
357300	358300	Hmm?
358300	359300	Hmm?
359300	360300	Moomin!
360300	361300	Moomin!
361300	362300	I told you so!
364300	365300	Hmm?
365300	366300	Moomin!
366300	368300	Come on!
368300	369300	Eww!
369300	370300	Eww!
370300	371300	Eww!
371300	372300	Eww!
372300	373300	Eww!
373300	374300	Eww!
374300	375300	Eww!
375300	377300	Eww!
377300	379300	I give up!
379300	381300	How strange!
381300	382300	How sad!
382300	383300	What do you mean?
383300	384300	I think...
385300	386300	You don't think...
386300	388300	You don't think...
388300	389300	It's hard to tell.
389300	391300	I was listening for his heartbeat.
393300	395300	He's still breathing.
396300	398300	And snort baited?
399300	402300	Wake up, you slug of it!
402300	404300	Snort baited!
405300	406300	They won't wake up!
407300	408300	This is strange!
408300	410300	Why don't we go and try the other?
410300	411300	Why not?
411300	413300	I hate it when others are asleep while I'm up.
413300	416300	But then I don't like it much the other way around either.
416300	417300	Do I snap?
421300	422300	Moomin!
422300	423300	Pop up!
423300	424300	Please wake up!
424300	425300	We've tried to wake up Moomin, but he won't!
425300	426300	Wakey!
426300	427300	Moomin!
427300	428300	Mama breakfast time!
428300	429300	Come on, Moomin!
429300	430300	Pop up!
430300	431300	Wake up!
431300	433300	This is no use!
441300	442300	Goodness!
442300	444300	This seems the Moomins are still hibernating.
444300	446300	And so is Snort Maiden.
446300	447300	That's odd.
447300	449300	She always wakes up even before me.
449300	451300	Oh, Moomin, too!
451300	453300	But this year it seems to be different!
453300	456300	I'll go back home, and I'll come over again in a little while
456300	458300	when the Moomin family will have woken up.
458300	460300	If they ever do.
460300	461300	Huh?
461300	464300	We've tried everything to wake them up short of buckets of water
464300	465300	and there's no moving them.
465300	469300	We've shouted and shook and pinched and tickled and stopped!
469300	470300	Oh, dear!
470300	472300	It's not just strange, it's ominous!
472300	475300	Oh, my, surely not.
475300	477300	Hello, everybody!
477300	480300	How is everyone?
480300	481300	What is it?
481300	483300	You all look very scared.
483300	485300	Huh?
485300	488300	Still hibernating?
491300	495300	It's all very strange, Hamilton.
495300	497300	Moomin!
497300	498300	See?
498300	500300	Yes, indeed.
502300	505300	How we can really do is wait and see.
505300	506300	I suppose you're right.
506300	507300	Don't worry.
507300	509300	The days are getting longer all the time now.
509300	512300	So the Moomins can't sleep much longer.
512300	514300	And Snort Maiden?
514300	516300	Cheat too, of course.
516300	519300	Bet you anything Moomin wakes up when Snuffkin returns.
519300	522300	I think you're right, Sniff.
522300	526300	And then, one day about a week later,
526300	530300	Snuffkin did come back from his yearly trip south.
531300	532300	Snuffkin!
532300	533300	Snuffkin!
533300	534300	Snuffkin!
534300	535300	Snuffkin!
535300	536300	Snuffkin!
536300	537300	Snuffkin!
537300	538300	Snuffkin!
538300	539300	Snuffkin!
539300	540300	Snuffkin!
540300	541300	Snuffkin!
541300	542300	Snuffkin!
542300	543300	Snuffkin!
543300	544300	Snuffkin!
544300	545300	Snuffkin!
545300	546300	Snuffkin!
546300	547300	Snuffkin!
547300	548300	Snuffkin!
548300	549300	Snuffkin!
549300	550300	Snuffkin!
553300	554300	Snuffkin!
554300	555300	Snuffkin!
555300	556300	Snuffkin!
556300	557300	Snuffkin!
557300	558300	Snuffkin!
558300	559300	Snuffkin!
560300	561300	Snuffkin!
567300	568300	Snuffkin!
568300	571300	Snuffkin!
577300	578300	Snuffkin!
578300	579300	Snuffkin!
581300	582300	Snuffkin!
582300	583300	Snuffkin!
583300	584300	Snuffkin!
584300	585300	Snuffkin!
585300	586300	Snuffkin!
586300	593300	Where's Moomin?
593300	596300	He's in bad.
596300	598300	Moomin's still asleep.
598300	600300	A sleep.
608300	611300	They won't wake up no matter what you do.
611300	614300	What do you think, Snuffkin?
614300	615300	I think they're very sick.
615300	617300	That's a possibility.
617300	619300	Sleeping sickness, perhaps?
619300	621300	It's very difficult to say.
621300	623300	To me, though, if you want my honest opinion,
623300	626300	I think somebody has cast a very nasty spell on them.
626300	628300	A spell?
628300	630300	But who would do that?
630300	632300	I think I know.
632300	633300	Huh?
633300	634300	You mean the witch?
634300	636300	Alice is grandmother.
636300	637300	Why?
637300	639300	To tell you the truth, I haven't the biggest idea.
639300	643300	How do we find out?
643300	645300	I'll go to the forest and see her.
645300	648300	And if she did cast a spell, do you think she'd tell you?
648300	651300	I really don't know, but we have to do something.
651300	654300	We can't just leave them sleeping here forever.
654300	656300	I'll go with you.
656300	659300	I guess I better stay here to take care of things.
659300	663300	Well, if they suddenly wake up, somebody needs to be here.
663300	665300	Snuffkin.
665300	666300	Huh?
666300	667300	That's him.
667300	668300	At last.
668300	669300	Moomin.
669300	670300	Moomin.
670300	671300	Moomin.
671300	673300	He's dreaming.
673300	677300	Just looking at him makes me feel sleepy.
677300	683300	Moomin, I promise to get this horrible spell cast off for you.
702300	704300	Uh-oh.
704300	706300	Uh-oh.
713300	715300	Oh, shit.
720300	722300	Where are you going?
722300	726300	I've done all the chores, even washed out your old push-in jars.
726300	728300	So where are you going?
728300	729300	It's here, Grandma.
729300	731300	I thought I'd take some time off to celebrate.
731300	733300	But what about your work?
733300	736300	I'm just going out for the day, Grandma.
736300	738300	And I know where.
738300	740300	I only want to see the Moomin's.
740300	742300	They're still hibernating.
742300	744300	No, they're not. It isn't winter anymore.
744300	748300	Winter or spring, I happen to know the Moomin's are still asleep.
748300	751300	How could you know what the Moomin's are up to, Grandma?
751300	752300	Hm.
752300	754300	Oh, which is no everything, my dear girl.
754300	755300	Really?
755300	757300	Well, I'll go and see.
758300	760300	Come here.
766300	770300	I have to admit that I can't help being worried about the Moomin's.
770300	773300	Their windows are open for the spring.
773300	776300	So they can smell the first spring flowers?
776300	779300	Well, I suppose I'd be getting on.
784300	787300	Why didn't you tell them about the witch in the spell?
787300	790300	Well, after all, that was just an idea, I got.
790300	792300	Ideas can be embarrassing if you were wrong,
792300	795300	so don't tell anyone for the time being.
795300	796300	All right.
796300	797300	I'm going.
799300	801300	And I'm leaving, too.
801300	802300	Okay.
808300	810300	There's Alicia.
810300	813300	Hi, everyone. It's me.
813300	815300	Why do you get a teller?
815300	818300	We better tell of the truth, I guess.
825300	827300	The best thing would be for me to talk to her first.
827300	828300	Yes, I agree.
828300	831300	She's unbelievable. How could she?
834300	837300	I can hardly believe you could be so mean, Grandma.
837300	839300	Calm down, my dear.
839300	842300	Why, I did it all for you, Alicia.
842300	844300	You did it for me.
844300	847300	If the moments are asleep, why should you go there?
847300	849300	Do them a world of good, too, along sleep.
849300	851300	How ridiculous, grandmother.
851300	853300	Alicia, you've done quite well in your studies,
853300	859300	and if you keep at it, I see no reason why you shouldn't be a fully-fledged witch before 30.
859300	864300	And if I do see the moments, I won't be a witch till I'm 31, is that what you mean?
864300	867300	Now, the moments are very bad, and the ones on you.
867300	872300	They are so disgustingly good, and if you want to be a witch, you mustn't see them.
873300	881300	And if I promise never to go near Moomin Valley again, will you lift the spell, Grandma?
881300	884300	Good girl, that's exactly what I wanted here.
884300	886300	You promise me, Dan, Alicia?
886300	887300	I promise, Grandma.
887300	889300	Right, the spell should be lifted.
889300	890300	Snuff guard.
890300	891300	What do you want?
891300	895300	There are two different ways of lifting the spell I cast on the moments.
895300	896300	Uh-huh.
896300	901300	The first one is that I go to Moomin Valley myself and chant the magic words outside their bedroom window.
901300	903300	Oh, Grandma, that's not a good idea.
903300	908300	Oh, oh, you mean people who might be upset about me casting a spell on the moments?
908300	910300	You may be right.
910300	914300	So therefore, Snuff Kid, I have no choice but to ask you to perform the task.
914300	916300	Oh, but why me?
916300	918300	You do have your harmonica with you?
918300	919300	Of course.
919300	921300	Let me have it, please.
922300	924300	Eldris Cabalasome.
924300	926300	Eldris Cabalasome.
926300	928300	Eldris Cabalasome.
928300	929300	Eldris Cabalasome.
929300	930300	Eldris Cabalasome.
930300	932300	Eldris Cabalasome.
932300	936300	If you don't stop staring at me, my witchcraft won't be effective.
936300	939300	Alicia, get me the next potion now.
939300	940300	Oh.
940300	941300	Oh.
941300	944300	All right, grandmother.
947300	948300	Eldris Cabalasome.
948300	949300	Eldris Cabalasome.
949300	950300	Eldris Cabalasome.
950300	953300	Oh, she can't do it if we look at her, huh?
955300	957300	Now, listen, Inspector.
957300	958300	You must do something.
958300	960300	You are the police, aren't you?
960300	964300	Well, I have to tell you, waking people up is not really part of our job.
964300	966300	But you're our last hope, Inspector.
966300	968300	You must do something.
968300	971300	Perhaps if you could possibly use your whistle to wake them up.
971300	972300	Uh-huh.
972300	974300	It's very shrill indoors. Good frighten them.
974300	976300	And fire your revolver.
976300	978300	I'm sure that would do it, Inspector.
978300	981300	I don't carry guns, they're dangerous.
981300	983300	Oh, dear.
988300	990300	Hey, Snuffkin!
990300	992300	Little Y!
992300	995300	He sounds worried, I bet they're still fast asleep.
995300	996300	Hmm.
1000300	1001300	Right, Snuffkin?
1001300	1003300	Get on with it.
1008300	1010300	Hmm.
1020300	1022300	It's not working, is it?
1022300	1024300	Give me a chance, Snuff.
1032300	1034300	Hmm.
1034300	1036300	Snuffkin!
1036300	1038300	Snuffkin!
1038300	1039300	Snuffkin!
1039300	1040300	Snuffkin!
1040300	1041300	Snuffkin!
1041300	1042300	Snuffkin!
1042300	1043300	Snuffkin!
1043300	1045300	Snuffkin!
1045300	1046300	Snuffkin!
1046300	1047300	Snuffkin!
1047300	1048300	Snuffkin!
1048300	1049300	Snuffkin!
1049300	1050300	Snuffkin!
1050300	1051300	Wake up, spring is here.
1051300	1052300	Come on.
1052300	1053300	Hmm.
1053300	1054300	Hmm.
1054300	1055300	Hmm.
1055300	1056300	Hmm.
1056300	1057300	Oh, spring is here already.
1057300	1058300	Good morning, Papa, dear.
1058300	1059300	Hmm.
1059300	1060300	Good morning.
1060300	1062300	I have a feeling we've over slept.
1062300	1064300	I wonder whether the others are up yet.
1064300	1065300	Snuffkin?
1065300	1066300	Oh, shut up, Snuff.
1066300	1069300	Maybe she forgot how to cast off the spell.
1069300	1070300	Hi, Snuffkin!
1070300	1071300	Hi!
1071300	1072300	Ah!
1072300	1073300	Morning!
1075300	1077300	Morning, everybody!
1077300	1078300	Hi, Snuffkin!
1081300	1084300	I'm so glad you were right back already, Snuffkin.
1084300	1085300	Yes.
1086300	1088300	You woke up early, too.
1088300	1089300	Did you hear that?
1089300	1091300	It's you that woke up late, woman.
1092300	1094300	Ah, who we?
1097300	1098300	Hmm.
1098300	1099300	Ah.
1100300	1103300	Now I say, movement's all ready up and about.
1103300	1104300	What?
1104300	1106300	Ah, hi, Snuff!
1106300	1108300	Oh, it's you, you're awake.
1108300	1110300	I'm glad I didn't blow my whistle.
1110300	1113300	But we did have a reason to be worried, Inspector.
1113300	1114300	He's right.
1114300	1115300	What about, moment, Mama?
1115300	1117300	And, moment, Papa?
1117300	1119300	Oh, there, everybody.
1119300	1120300	Is anything the matter?
1120300	1121300	Nothing at all.
1121300	1122300	There are weak.
1122300	1124300	Oh, dear, I don't understand.
1124300	1125300	You don't understand words.
1125300	1129300	We were very worried because you just wouldn't wake up.
1129300	1130300	Oh, really?
1130300	1132300	You do know we always have a night, don't you?
1132300	1135300	We sleep all winter, and we always wake up in the spring.
1135300	1138300	Of course, of course, but this year, start your turn.
1138300	1140300	Right, well, we did have a bit of a problem.
1140300	1143300	You see, moment, Papa, we couldn't swim.
1143300	1144300	Snuffkin.
1144300	1145300	You're back already.
1145300	1146300	Yes.
1146300	1148300	Why don't you listen to us, moment, Papa?
1148300	1149300	Very well.
1150300	1152300	Why don't you come in and we'll have a nice cup of tea,
1152300	1155300	and then we can discuss your problem properly.
1155300	1158300	But it's your problem, I'm afraid, not ours.
1158300	1159300	What does he mean?
1159300	1161300	We don't have a problem, do we?
1161300	1164300	Please do come in anyway, everybody.
1164300	1165300	Please.
1165300	1166300	You too.
1166300	1167300	All of you, come in.
1167300	1169300	Come in, everybody.
1171300	1172300	I'm on the side.
1172300	1173300	I'm in Georgia.
1180300	1182300	Whatever happened was this year.
1182300	1183300	Hey, Snuffkin.
1191300	1192300	Alicia!
1192300	1193300	Alicia!
1193300	1194300	Alicia!
1199300	1200300	Oh, man!
1200300	1202300	We've come to see you, Alicia.
1202300	1203300	That was nice of you.
1205300	1207300	Your grandmother isn't home, is she?
1207300	1208300	No.
1208300	1210300	Then we can play hide and seek.
1210300	1211300	I can't.
1211300	1213300	I promise grandma there.
1213300	1215300	Yes, I know. Snuffkin told me.
1215300	1217300	That was a really great thing to do.
1217300	1219300	But you didn't promise not to see us.
1219300	1222300	You just promised not to go to Mom and Valley, didn't you?
1222300	1223300	Yeah.
1223300	1226300	And listen, you never promised not to play with us either, did you?
1226300	1227300	No.
1227300	1230300	So, if we came here to see you instead of you to us,
1230300	1233300	then it's all right, and you don't have to break your promise.
1233300	1235300	Oh, I suppose so.
1235300	1237300	Yes, I suppose you're right.
1237300	1239300	Well, let's play.
1239300	1240300	Yay!
1242300	1248300	13, 4, 3, 5, 8!
1261300	1266300	That afternoon, they all had the most wonderful time playing hide and seek in the woods.
1266300	1268300	Ha-ha-ha!
1268300	1272300	One, two, three,
1272300	1274300	your tiniest hour.
1274300	1280300	Five, six, seven,
1280300	1283300	ha-ha-ha-ha!
1283300	1289300	Mine, ten, eleven.
1289300	1299300	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements,
1299300	1307300	believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1307300	1311300	They're always happy and goes at play.
1311300	1318300	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements.
1318300	1328300	The movements, the movements.
