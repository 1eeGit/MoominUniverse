0	21000	Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come. Come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here for you on your TV they are the movements. They are the movements.
29000	41000	So come with me give me your hand. I'll take you up to a moment land. You can fly just like a bird. Sing the best song ever.
41000	58000	There were the movements. There were the movements. There were the movements.
71000	91000	There were the movements. There were the movements.
102000	108000	It was the end of summer but still every day seemed hotter than the last.
108000	114000	Movement Valley had had no rain for weeks and finally the river had dried up.
114000	118000	Papa says this weather is a catastrophe.
118000	119000	Oh not really.
119000	123000	But it is. He says movement Valley will turn into a desert if it carries on.
123000	126000	I don't think that will happen movement.
126000	130000	Papa can't ever remember it so hot even the river has dried up.
130000	134000	No that does worry me. I can't fish anymore.
134000	140000	In all my travels I found that droughts like this are always followed by a real heavy downpour.
140000	149000	Well it's too hot for me anyway.
150000	159000	Oh it's so hot I can't think.
159000	167000	I can I can always think of something.
168000	188000	Well well even the weeds are wilting.
188000	190000	The sea never dries up does it?
190000	193000	Of course not stupid wherever the fish go.
193000	203000	I'm going swimming.
204000	227000	Here you are.
227000	237000	Watch this.
258000	267000	Ah!
267000	277000	Ah!
278000	287000	Ah!
287000	294000	Ouch that hurt.
294000	296000	What's this stupid box doing here?
296000	299000	I think it's floated from foreign lands.
299000	301000	What's it got in it?
301000	303000	Perhaps it's full of priceless jewels.
304000	307000	No it wouldn't float so high in the water if it was.
307000	309000	A tiara packed in wood shavings.
309000	312000	I can use a new comb too.
312000	314000	What have you found you too?
314000	315000	I treasure it.
315000	317000	No we don't think so. It's not heavy enough.
317000	319000	But you never know snork maiden.
319000	321000	Let's open it and see.
321000	329000	Come on Slays push me a shore.
329000	331000	Perhaps it's gold nuggets in here.
331000	339000	Are diamonds or something to eat?
339000	347000	What is this?
347000	349000	Well seeds maybe.
349000	353000	What sort of seeds?
353000	358000	Well at first glance I'd say they might be tropical plants.
359000	360000	Really?
360000	362000	What plants are tropical?
362000	364000	Well species like banana or mango.
364000	366000	Banana and mango.
366000	372000	Well I haven't done a lot of research on tropical plants so I can't be sure but they do look like it.
372000	375000	I know mama. Why don't we plant them?
375000	377000	Good idea woman.
377000	380000	The thing is we don't have a tropical climate.
380000	382000	I'm afraid they wouldn't grow here at all.
382000	384000	Let's plant them shall we?
384000	387000	They won't bear any fruit so don't get too excited.
387000	391000	Oh well it seems tropical enough to me Mr. Hanuman.
391000	393000	At least we can try can't we?
393000	396000	I want to see what papaya looks like and ugly fruit.
396000	399000	I want mangoes growing all around my banjo window.
399000	401000	Let's plant them shall we?
403000	408000	I tell you they're strictly tropical they won't take root at all.
417000	424000	It certainly seems that mama is enjoying herself Mr. Hanuman.
424000	426000	I don't think it'll be much use.
426000	430000	Well perhaps not but it's still worth the fun in trying.
430000	434000	Imagine woman valley a tropical jungle.
434000	435000	Huh huh.
435000	436000	Oh Mr. Hanuman.
436000	440000	Do you think these seeds will grow into real fruit trees?
440000	442000	Let me see.
442000	445000	What have you got here little my?
445000	450000	I could very well be mistaken but I think this one is a mango seed.
450000	452000	Thanks.
452000	455000	And why do you want to know a little my?
455000	459000	Because I'm only growing fruit trees.
460000	462000	Hmm thanks.
462000	465000	And why do you want to know a little my?
465000	467000	Because I'm only growing fruit.
467000	472000	I want to be sure I'm not planning stupid orchids or passion flowers or something.
474000	476000	Mr. Hemuman.
476000	479000	Can you tell me which one of these is banana?
479000	483000	Yeah I'm not really too sure but I think it's this one.
483000	486000	You want to grow an orchid too snorke maiden?
486000	489000	I just want to plant a banana tree in a really special place.
489000	492000	It's Moon's favorite fruit.
496000	500000	I think she'll be disappointed bananas won't grow here.
500000	502000	This weather doesn't belong here either.
502000	504000	If it gets any hotter I'll melt.
504000	507000	I can't wait for dusk so it'll cool down a bit.
507000	509000	Hmm.
517000	522000	Isn't it wonderful to go to sleep looking at the stars?
522000	524000	And it's not so hot anymore.
524000	527000	I'll sleep like a log tonight.
527000	530000	You always do don't you little my?
530000	533000	Well sleep like an extra heavy log then.
538000	543000	Snorke maiden, why don't you sleep under that tree with moon men and little my?
543000	548000	Because I can't see the stars from there and it makes me feel romantic looking at them.
548000	552000	But you're going to get very wet if it starts raining in the night.
552000	554000	You're joking surely mama.
554000	556000	Not at all.
556000	560000	But it hasn't rained for ages and there aren't any clouds or anything.
560000	561000	Just stars.
561000	565000	All the toothpicks fell on the floor and that's a sure sign of rain.
565000	567000	Snorke maiden won't mind if she gets all wet.
567000	570000	Moon Mama, that should be happy.
570000	572000	Who, why is that?
572000	578000	Because then she'll know that the special tree will start growing and that's very important to her.
578000	580000	That's true.
580000	582000	Good night everyone.
582000	584000	I hope you sleep well.
591000	594000	Good night everybody.
603000	604000	Good night woman.
604000	606000	Good night, don't snorke.
622000	625000	It's too hot to sleep.
625000	628000	Why don't you sleep outside like the children?
628000	630000	I think I will.
633000	635000	A thunderstorm.
635000	638000	I told you the toothpicks are never wrong.
656000	658000	Hey it's raining movement.
658000	660000	Wake up movement.
661000	663000	Oh is it morning?
663000	665000	The sun's really bright.
665000	667000	No it's raining.
667000	669000	Rainy?
669000	671000	Look at that.
671000	674000	You look I'm getting wet I'm going inside.
674000	676000	So mama was right about the rain.
676000	679000	Hey snorke maiden.
679000	681000	Doesn't she look sweet?
681000	682000	Snorke maiden.
682000	684000	Is it raining?
684000	685000	That's very clever.
685000	688000	Your mother knows everything doesn't she?
688000	689000	She does.
690000	691000	Not yet.
691000	693000	I want to feel the rain on my face.
693000	695000	It's been so long.
699000	702000	You want to feel it much longer?
719000	722000	It's raining.
750000	752000	It's raining.
765000	766000	Mangoes.
766000	768000	That's impossible.
768000	770000	Gosh.
774000	777000	By my tail a jungle that's a tropical jungle.
780000	782000	Wake up, wake up you two.
782000	784000	There's a jungle outside.
784000	786000	We've planted a jungle.
788000	790000	A jungle.
794000	795000	You're right moment.
795000	797000	Those seeds have not only sprouted.
797000	800000	I know they're big trees.
800000	802000	I've never known trees to grow like that.
802000	804000	That's bad.
804000	806000	I know.
806000	808000	I've never known trees to grow like that.
808000	809000	That's...
809000	810000	It's...
810000	813000	I think I'll go and play Tarzan.
813000	816000	I wish my lettuce seeds would do that move in papa.
816000	818000	There's magic here somewhere mama.
818000	820000	Let's go and explore.
823000	826000	That's rain drumming on the campus.
833000	834000	It must be.
834000	836000	Snuffkin?
839000	841000	What a nurse all this.
841000	844000	Well, we found a crate of tropical seeds
844000	846000	and planted them last night.
846000	848000	And this morning while you can see it's like magic.
848000	850000	It's fantastic.
850000	851000	I know.
851000	853000	We can go on a safari.
858000	860000	I've seen nothing like it.
861000	864000	What kind of flower is this?
864000	866000	It looks like an orchid to me.
866000	869000	This is a real tropical jungle isn't it Snuffkin?
869000	870000	Not quite.
870000	871000	What do you mean?
871000	875000	Well, Moomin, a real jungle would have wild animals in it, wouldn't it?
875000	877000	Oh yeah, like tigers and snakes.
877000	881000	This is more of a tropical botanical garden, I suppose.
891000	893000	That's Moomin's little mind.
893000	895000	He can have the peel.
897000	899000	This is a life.
903000	905000	Stop, little mind.
905000	907000	Well, well.
910000	912000	What are you looking for dear?
912000	913000	My solar toady.
913000	914000	You what?
914000	917000	My sun helmet, I can't go into the jungle without it.
917000	919000	I didn't know you had one.
919000	922000	I used it for a fancy dress party once I know.
922000	924000	I put it in a box somewhere.
924000	926000	Oh, here it is.
926000	928000	Very dashing dear.
928000	929000	I thought so too.
929000	931000	Oh, I know.
932000	934000	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
948000	950000	Splendid protection is hat.
955000	959000	Papa, what in earth are you doing?
959000	962000	I want to get into the cellar.
962000	964000	What for?
964000	965000	To get my gun.
965000	966000	Your gun?
966000	970000	Only fools venture into the jungle without a proper gun.
970000	972000	I don't think you need a gun, Papa.
972000	974000	And why not?
974000	976000	Because there aren't any wild animals.
976000	979000	Well, one of the seas might have been an egg or something.
981000	984000	Look at these, for instance, they look very animal.
986000	988000	Very odd animals.
988000	990000	More of an odd plant, I think.
990000	991000	I'd stay away from them.
991000	993000	They could be very dangerous.
993000	995000	But they've got eyes.
995000	996000	Careful.
996000	998000	I think they're man-eating plants.
998000	1000000	Man-eating.
1000000	1003000	Stop that.
1003000	1005000	Help.
1005000	1006000	Help.
1006000	1008000	Oh, they're trying to eat me.
1008000	1010000	They want to feed me to their young.
1010000	1012000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, help me.
1012000	1014000	Oh, help.
1014000	1016000	They're tearing my tail.
1016000	1018000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
1018000	1022000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, oh, dear.
1022000	1025000	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
1025000	1027000	Help.
1027000	1028000	Oh!
1028000	1030000	Oh, no, oh, oh, oh, oh.
1030000	1033000	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
1033000	1035000	Well done, my little maya.
1035000	1037000	Just saved my life.
1037000	1039000	Well, I saved your tail, anyway.
1039000	1040000	Oh.
1040000	1041000	Oh.
1041000	1042000	Oh.
1042000	1044000	Oh, oh.
1044000	1046600	Oh! It's something to jam this door shut!
1047400	1049540	Come on! Hurry!
1051000	1054800	Oh! Oh! Oh, no! We... you can't hold on much longer!
1054800	1056800	Hmm.
1056800	1058800	Hmm.
1058800	1060800	Huh?
1060800	1062800	Hmm.
1062800	1064800	Hmm.
1064800	1066800	Hmm.
1066800	1068800	Hmm.
1068800	1070800	Hmm.
1070800	1072800	Hmm.
1072800	1074800	That should keep them in now, shouldn't it?
1074800	1076800	Well, I don't think they could push their way through that lot.
1076800	1078800	Hmm. They had a very strong grip on my tail.
1078800	1080800	He mustn't underestimate them.
1080800	1082800	Anything wrong?
1082800	1087800	You bet! The seller's full of man-eating plants tried to gobble up moment papa!
1087800	1088800	Oh!
1088800	1090800	Oh my goodness!
1090800	1092800	What's the matter?
1092800	1094800	You can get straight from the seller into the kitchen.
1094800	1098800	What? Oh no, mama!
1108800	1110800	Oh my gosh!
1110800	1112800	Oh, hello!
1112800	1114800	Cue, we got here just in time!
1114800	1117800	What ever's the matter with you? Are you all playing Tarzan?
1117800	1119800	Oh no, mama!
1119800	1122800	I'm making grandmas if you ever get a tropical fruit recipe.
1122800	1126800	And perhaps now it's rained I can wash this dirty floor.
1128800	1134800	Ah! Ah! By the great bumble I don't believe this a tropical rainforest!
1134800	1136800	Ah! Ah!
1136800	1140800	Ah! Ah! Transcendentia megaloids!
1140800	1143800	And yes, a dispensia florian wonder!
1143800	1148800	Goodness me, I can collect a whole tropical hermoreum right here in Moomin Valley!
1148800	1152800	Ah, Trowel, that's what I need. I'll get one from the Moomins!
1152800	1156800	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
1156800	1160800	Ha, ha, ha, ha!
1160800	1161800	Yeah.

1162800	1165000	Must say they're not the tiniest family.
1165000	1166240	I'll have to move this.
1166240	1170040	Oh, this old furniture.
1170040	1171040	Yeah.

1212040	1213040	Huh.
1213040	1214040	Huh.
1214040	1215040	Huh.
1215040	1216040	Huh.
1216040	1217040	Huh.
1217040	1218040	Huh.
1218040	1219040	Huh.
1219040	1221040	They were in the cellar.
1221040	1223040	Did you open the door, Mr. Hamilin?
1223040	1224040	Well, yes.
1224040	1227040	I wanted to borrow a trowel.
1227040	1230040	Mr. Hamilin, you know all about plants.
1230040	1232040	Do you have any idea how we can get rid of them?
1232040	1234040	They're man-eaters, you know?
1234040	1235040	Can't rid of them.
1235040	1236040	Huh.
1236040	1237040	Well, let's see.
1237040	1239040	We are in a bit of a fix.
1239040	1242040	I have heard that they have reacted to music.
1242040	1243040	Music.
1243040	1246040	Snoopkin, you could play your harmonica.
1246040	1247040	Hmm.
1249040	1251040	Hmm.
1263040	1266040	Look, they've started dancing.
1266040	1268040	Keep it up, Snoopkin.
1279040	1287040	What will they do if he stops playing?
1287040	1289040	I really don't know.
1295040	1297040	Oh, what's this?
1297040	1298040	Oh.
1299040	1301040	Oh.
1307040	1311040	They're rather sweet when they don't try to eat you.
1311040	1314040	And that was how a tropical jungle grew
1314040	1317040	and surrounded movement house in one night.
1317040	1319040	Is it going to stay?
1319040	1320040	And for how long?
1320040	1323040	And what will the man-eating plants do
1323040	1326040	if Snoopkin stops playing?
1328040	1330040	They love the laughter
1330040	1335040	and they love the living, the movements.
1335040	1338040	Believing in sharing and caring
1338040	1343040	and giving the movements.
1343040	1347040	They're always happy and always at play.
1347040	1350040	The movements are having fun day after day.
1350040	1354040	The movements.
1354040	1357040	They love the laughter
1357040	1361040	and they love the living, the movements.
1361040	1365040	Believing in sharing and caring
1365040	1369040	and giving the movements.
1369040	1373040	They're always happy and always at play.
1373040	1377040	The movements are having fun day after day.
1377040	1379040	The movements.
1379040	1383040	They're taking the movements.
1383040	1387040	The movements.
1387040	1393040	The movements.
