00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,579
They are the movements, they are the

00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,560
Moomin's bed.

10
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,760
Snuffkin, as always, preferred to sleep in his tent.

11
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,239
You remember what happened?

12
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,939
The horrible greek coming after thingamy and bob

13
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:11,639
and everything freezing?

14
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:27,000
For a moment, however, the night wasn't quite over yet. Mommy, papa! Help me! The girl gets after me!

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:03:12,939
I can't run anymore! Oh, oh! Sniff!

16
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,039
Morning, Mama! Good morning, Moomin.

17
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,240
Is Sniff up yet?

18
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,319
Huh, you're joking.

19
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,719
Where is the thing on the mampon?

20
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,439
They haven't stirred yet.

21
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:25,000
The poor things are tired out.

22
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Papa's not still asleep, is he? No, he's looking at my rose bushes.

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Are they okay, Papa?

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, frozen to death and look.

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What?

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's where she was standing over there with a grass is dead.

27
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,840
She must have been real cold to freeze the roses.

28
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,360
What a shame, they were very pretty.

29
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,120
Well, there's not much left of them now.

30
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,000
We'll have to grow some new ones.

31
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,599
I dreamed that she was chasing me, Papa.

32
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,199
Oh, don't worry, moment.

33
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,280
I think she's only after thing of me and Bob.

34
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,000
So there are not fugitives from justice after all?

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I have a feeling that they would prefer that moment.

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Aren't thing of Ian Bob coming down?

37
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes, if they could have breakfast in their room if you didn't mind.

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, what did they tell you?

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,279
What? About why the greek is chasing them.

40
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,800
Oh, they just looked terrified and wouldn't say anything

41
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,560
about her at all.

42
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,680
You know, we really ought to find out why.

43
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,519
Yes, you're right.

44
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,720
Mum and Mum, why don't you take their breakfast up

45
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,240
and see if they'll tell you anything

46
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:57,199
if any of us can get it out of the mukeh.

47
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,000
Who's that?

48
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,300
It's only me. I've brought you both a nice breakfast. Well, what did they say?

49
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,000
It seems that the greek is after the suitcase, not them.

50
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I wonder what's in it! Perhaps they've stolen her mummy as well!

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And they also said that it did use to belong to her.

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh dear, if they've stolen it...

53
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know about that.

54
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I asked them how they got it, but they wouldn't say another word.

55
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,199
Well, this is too much.

56
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,199
We could be harboring criminals.

57
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,199
I know they don't look like it, but you never know, do you?

58
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,699
You can ask the girls!

59
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:54,699
Shh! Don't shout!

60
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:56,199
No, that's no good.

61
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,500
We don't want to come back here most definitely.

62
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's ask the police inspector to question them.

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We don't want to get the police involved. Well, you'll suggest something, Anne. Quint, shouting, sniff.

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Look, why don't you just wait for them to tell you, Moomin?

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I know it seems strange, but I've noticed that if you pretend not to be interested,

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
people can't wait to tell you those secrets.

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
They told Mama about the suitcase, but they wouldn't say anything to Papa.

68
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You know something, Moomin. People can't wait to tell you their secrets. They told Mama about the suitcase, but they wouldn't say anything to Papa.

69
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You know something, Moomin?

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They might open up to Snork Maiden.

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
She's someone more their own age.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You could be right.

73
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hey, Snork Maiden!

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Where are you going?

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Moomin house.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll come with you.

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But I thought you were living there.

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I was until mumble came back yesterday.

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How is she?

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Bossie, and she snores too.

81
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Woman!

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Snorke maiden.

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Where are you off to?

84
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Well, I was just on my way to see you.

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, that's so nice, and I've come to see you, Moomin.

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I brought you a little present, Moomin.

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
A present for me.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes, and it's very beautiful.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What is it?

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Something you must never break or lose.

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I promise I won't.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There you are.

93
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Thank you.

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Go on, open it.

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,600
A lot of beautiful shell!

96
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,800
I spent all of yesterday on the beach searching for it, just for you.

97
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,199
Look, we can see ourselves in it.

98
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,399
So we can!

99
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,399
Thank you very much, Snorkmade, it's my heart, and I want you to look after me.

100
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,399
Oh, I will, Snorkmade, and I will.

101
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,600
I'll think of you whenever I look at it.

102
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,199
I'll move in.

103
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,680
I promise you that I'll always kiss the shell

104
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,879
before I go to sleep.

105
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,079
It will be my most precious treasure.

106
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,040
Apart from me?

107
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,720
So what shall I do?

108
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,920
Take them for a walk?

109
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes, but take your time and don't rush them.

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'll let them cry on my shoulder.

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes, and try and talk to them as well, though.

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I feel very important and a little bit nervous, too.

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Have some tea first.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Thank you, Mum and Mama.

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,399
Ah!

116
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,600
We don't need your help, Little My. Ha, that's what you think.

117
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I'd be able to weedle out their secrets.

118
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
It's not an interrogation.

119
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
We only want to talk to them, you know?

120
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,200
So you can weedle out their secrets.

121
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,399
I'll be very quiet.

122
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,000
Little My, have you ever managed to be very quiet?

123
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Not really, but there's only one way to find out.

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You must let me go with Snork Maiden.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
No, this situation needs a tender understanding, one.

126
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's me, exactly!

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You ready? I suppose so.

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hello, it's Moomin. Can I talk to you for a minute?

129
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Hello? This is Snorth Maiden. She's a very good friend of mine.

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Hello, I'm very happy to meet you both.

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
She's very tender and understanding and she'd like to talk to you. Can she come in?

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,600
Well, if she has to, moment.

133
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Come in, then.

134
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yippee-yippee-yippee-yippee.

135
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,200
It's very beautiful, a perfect heart shape.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I've never seen anything like it, moment.

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Would you like one, Mama?

138
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No, my dear. There should only be one shell like this.

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Then would you keep it somewhere safe for me?

140
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, self-kin.

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sure Snorkmaiden will get it out of him.

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I do hope so. I think they like it or anyway.

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I have a feeling in my bones that Groke will be back tonight.

144
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh.

145
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If we could find out why she's after them, we'd know what to do.

146
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Mama won't have any garden left if that monster comes back every night.

147
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Moment.

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hmm? Move it. Move it. Huh? Well done.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Snork maiden.

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Little Mai!

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh no, she'll ruin everything if we don't stop her.

152
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If you win the fear, I'll be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will

153
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
ruin the fear.

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who Oh no, she'll ruin everything if we don't stop her.

155
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If you win to fear a little, my I'll never forgive you.

156
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What? Interfear? Me? Never.

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Look, let's just leave it up to snork maiden now, little my.

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You'll need me of snork maiden that tend to and understanding enough.

159
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Hey, moment!

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So, how is snork maiden getting on her taking them for a stroll? and understanding enough. Hey, moment!

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So, how is Snorkmaiden getting on her,

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
taking them for a stroll?

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Where are they?

164
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If we were narrow...

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Papa, if we get much closer...

166
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And the last thing we want is for them to see us.

167
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Looks like I'll have to go and talk to them. You're all too big.

168
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll come back later and tell you what they said.

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No, don't. You'll upset Snorkmaiden.

170
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You're the one who's upsetting her!

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Shh!

172
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
All right. Can I ask you again about the suitcase?

173
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes!

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,200
Does that suitcase belong to you or is it the Groaks?

175
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
No!

176
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Yes!

177
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,799
Let's try it another way.

178
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,799
Who's is that suitcase?

179
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,500
It's ours, it's ours!

180
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,600
But you told Mum and Mama that it wasn't yours?

181
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,000
It was the Groaks!

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,500
Yes, we did!

183
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh... that it wasn't yours? It was the Groakes! Yes, we did!

184
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, do you mind if I ask you one more time?

185
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Please do!

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Right, here we go.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Now all I want is a simple yes or no.

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Is that suitcase yours or not?

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No, yes!

190
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, take your time, Snorkmaine, and don't rush them, he said.

191
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What was that, Snorkmaine?

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Look, I'm sorry, but can I ask you again?

193
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yes, as many times as you want.

194
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Thank you. This is the very last time, so please tell me the truth.

195
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,080
Now then, the suitcase. Yes, you know which one? Yes. Does it belong to you? Yes, it does.

196
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,399
So it's not the Grookes. Yes, it is not the Grookes. At last we're getting somewhere, praise the

197
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:07,000
booble. We're very happy for you. Snork maiden is really having to work hard. I wouldn't have, I'd scare them into talking.

198
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,399
You should have let me go.

199
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,639
Yeah, but we wanted someone gentle.

200
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,919
Snork maiden is nice.

201
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:16,120
Everybody in this house is nice.

202
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Do you think they'd let us stay here forever?

203
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Of course. If we can keep away from the grog.

204
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,519
Mm-hmm.

205
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,000
It took a long time, but in the end they trusted me,

206
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and now we're good friends.

207
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Who wouldn't trust you and want to be good friends?

208
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Thank you.

209
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It wasn't easy, though. They kept speaking together,

210
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and I got rather muddled.

211
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But they did tell me somehow.

212
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Rather muddled. I told you, guys, you should've let me do it.

213
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, I'm afraid I didn't get very much, though. I knew you guys you should let me do it. Oh I'm afraid I didn't get very much though.

214
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I knew you wouldn't.

215
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So what did you find out then, Snork Maiden?

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Tell us.

217
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, first of all, the suitcase does seem to be theirs.

218
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That was one thing they made very clear.

219
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Lennel can the grog.

220
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Just a minute, Moomin.

221
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What's in the suitcase on the other hand belongs to the grog.

222
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,960
That's the problem.

223
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,799
Oh dear, so they do have something belonging to a...

224
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:12,399
Well, Snork Maiden, what is it?

225
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,799
They wouldn't tell me what it is little my,

226
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,799
only that it is the most beautiful thing in the world.

227
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,039
How is it?

228
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,440
I wonder.

229
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,240
This is very difficult to understand.

230
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,000
I mean, thingy and bob don't look like thieves at all, do they?

231
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So, the gropes just wanted back what is hers?

232
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't see how that big ugly monster could own the most beautiful thing in the world.

233
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Well, what they said was that she just happened to have it.

234
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
They didn't say whether it belonged to her or not.

235
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So she might have stolen it herself.

236
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,360
They shouldn't have taken it, though.

237
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,559
Oh dear, oh dear.

238
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,440
Bob and Thingamy are very frightened

239
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,080
of how she'll take her revenge if she catches them.

240
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,200
But they're very determined to keep what's

241
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,240
in the suitcase, Moomin, Papa.

242
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,360
Oh, this is a fine mess, indeed.

243
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,440
The gropes should have come back tonight.

244
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,639
What can we do?

245
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,000
What can we do? What can we do? What can we do?

246
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,200
We can do the same as before.

247
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,500
Yeah, but it's not fair to drive her away.

248
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,799
If what's in the suitcase really does belong to her?

249
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,799
She means to get the suitcase

250
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:19,200
and I don't think it will be so easy to get rid of her this time.

251
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,000
And if she stays, we'll have a never-ending winter.

252
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Well, I'll cover up the petunias just in case.

253
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Are you all going to stay here?

254
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'll look after Snork.

255
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I will, Mum and Mama, I'll stay.

256
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You'll stay, won't you, Snuffkin?

257
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Don't look so clam, everyone. I've got an idea.

258
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But it would help if we knew what was in that suitcase.

259
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But even if we didn't, it could still work.

260
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Uh, what is it, dear?

261
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,480
Just wait, Papa. You'll see.

262
00:15:45,480 --> 00:16:26,000
Ha-ha-ha. I Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

263
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh, my God.

264
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh, my God.

265
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh, my God.

266
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh, my God.

267
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, my God.

268
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh, my God.

269
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh, my God.

270
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh, my God.

271
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Oh, my God.

272
00:16:44,000 --> 00:17:03,419
Oh, my God. Oh, I hope women Papa can do something.

273
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:05,000
It's your girl, little mom. Yes, I know.

274
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
There's the king and the queen.

275
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Uh, this one?

276
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Uh...

277
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Uh-oh, uh-oh, she's coming.

278
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Just when I was winning.

279
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You better hide under the table, little mom.

280
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Don't be stupid.

281
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:31,000
How can I hit her with my roll and pin from there.

282
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Where is she, Papa? Exactly where she was yesterday.

283
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'll go for a toast, alright, Papa?

284
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Let me go first, and then the rest of you can fan out behind me.

285
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Moment, Mama.

286
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,359
What is it, papa?

287
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,000
Perhaps now's the time to tell us your idea.

288
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,359
We haven't long.

289
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,000
Wait, Grog. Don't go know. We want to talk to you.

290
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
We know that you've come back to get what thing of me and Bob took from you.

291
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That is right, isn't it?

292
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Won't you let them keep it, perhaps?

293
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,200
No, we'll you sell it to them?

294
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:29,759
Oh, dear.

295
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,920
I have some very beautiful things here in my bag.

296
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,920
Maybe you'd like to trade, Groke.

297
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What about this pendant? Isn't it lovely? So you don't like that? What about this then?

298
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Or this?

299
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh. Or this?

300
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh. All right. Why don't you choose?

301
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Take anything you want from my handbag, except the hair slide.

302
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Which one do you want, this one? Let me see with this.

303
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Oh, this one?

304
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh, dear, that's not really mine to give to you.

305
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Snork maiden gave that to Mumen.

306
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,119
Is it all right if I give the shell to her

307
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:53,599
Mumann? Oh Mum! You'll never allow! Are you all right? Yes, my hand was suddenly frozen.

308
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:07,279
No, you've got the shell Mrs. Groke. Do you promise not to come back anymore? Because I'll get you if you do!

309
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,000
Well, that was a close thing. I'm glad that's over.

310
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Oh, you were marvelous, Mama.

311
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm so sorry, Moomin.

312
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I forgot that I had put your precious shell in my handbag to keep it safe.

313
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's all right, Mama. You gave it in a good cause.

314
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What snorkman gonna say, Moomin?

315
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I heard you. You said you'd never go to sleep without kissing it.

316
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Or something equally stupid.

317
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Well, I'm not gonna tell Snork maiden,

318
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
but I think Mama did the right thing.

319
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
She'll find out. I'm fed up with secrets.

320
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm always gonna tell the truth from now on, no matter what. Oh!

321
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Oh!

322
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh!

323
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Mumin, Mumin! Look! I found one! Really?

324
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Well, it's very similar, but the one snort maiden gave me was much bigger.

325
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,319
Oh, a lot bigger, was it?

326
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,200
Mumen had decided that he had to find a shell that was exactly the same as the one snork

327
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,599
maiden had given him.

328
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,319
Then with luck, she would never find out what he'd done with it.

329
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,319
Oh.

330
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:40,319
Oh.

331
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,319
Oh.

332
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,319
Oh.

333
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry.

334
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

335
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000

336
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000

338
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

339
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

340
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

341
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

342
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

343
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh, I'm sorry. Valley, miracles do happen.

344
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000

They're always happy and always at play.

347
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

348
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000

349
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The movements.

350
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They love the laughter and they love the living.
