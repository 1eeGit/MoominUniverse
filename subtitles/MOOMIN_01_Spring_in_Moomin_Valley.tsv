0	21000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.
29000	35000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.
35000	46000	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,
46000	58000	There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.
76000	77400	Clap Clap Clap Clap

97700	101560	Have you ever heard of Moon & Valley...
101560	110440	In winter, deep white snow covers the whole valley, and everyone goes to sleep so that they
110440	112640	keep warm.
112640	123760	Look, there's a woman house.
123760	131480	There's a woman, our hero.
131480	140920	A woman, Papa, and a woman, Mama.
140920	154440	And this little bundle must be little my.
154440	161440	I think before our story starts, we better wake everyone up with some spring sunshine.
184440	194440	At last, it's spring.
194440	201440	Wake up everyone, it's spring time.
201440	218440	Oh, little my, you're up.
218440	224440	It's hard to stay asleep with you yelling, I can't help it if I'm happy.
224440	230040	So yeah woke me, I was having a lovely dream about living in a watermelon, but it's beautiful
230040	231040	outside.
231040	234040	Oh gee, isn't it, is it really moving?
234040	239040	Yes, it's all fresh, the flowers are out and the sun is shining.
239040	241040	So, I like being asleep.
241040	242040	But it's spring.
242040	245040	You said you wanted me to wake you as soon as spring was here.
245040	247040	Oh boy, did I?
247040	249040	Yes, you did, little my.
249040	252040	You said you wanted to be a welcome as soon as spring was here.
252040	253040	Really?
253040	255040	Yes, you did.
255040	258040	Did I say something like that?
258040	260040	I can go back to bed if you want to.
260040	262040	Nobody's making you get up, little my.
262040	265040	No, there's really no point, movement.
265040	266040	I'm not sleepy anymore.
266040	269040	Well, there you are then.
269040	271040	Mama!
271040	273040	Good spring, movement.
273040	274040	Movement, mama.
274040	275040	I'm starving.
275040	277040	Have you got any watermelon?
277040	280040	No, but there's lots of other things.
280040	284040	We'll all have a nice big breakfast.
288040	291040	I can hear a snuff gun.
305040	309040	Wouldn't it be quicker to use the stairs?
309040	311040	More fun this way.
311040	314040	Are you going home now?
314040	315040	Yes.
315040	318040	Thanks very much for letting me spend the winter here.
318040	321040	Don't think your sister will be back yet, though.
321040	323040	I'll go anyway.
329040	331040	Snuff gun!
331040	333040	Oh, hello, movement.
333040	336040	It's really good to see you, snuff gun.
336040	337040	And you too?
337040	338040	You're back, Arlie.
338040	340040	Won't you have a good time?
340040	342040	Yes, I was.
342040	345040	But I didn't want to miss springtime and movement valley.
345040	347040	What did you do?
347040	349040	I'll tell you later.
349040	352040	Let's go wake up, Snuff, and think of something exciting to do.
352040	355040	I don't think I'll like it.
363040	366040	He's still snoring, movement.
366040	369040	I'll do it again.
370040	372040	Well, that's done it.
375040	378040	Come on, Snuff, it's spring.
378040	379040	Snuff gun's here.
379040	381040	Please go away, you two.
381040	384040	We're going to do something really exciting.
384040	386040	Like what, moment?
386040	389040	I can think of more exciting things to do than this.
389040	393040	Well, let's imagine that we're the first ever to climb this mountain.
393040	395040	It's such a clear day.
395040	398040	We'll be able to see all the movement valley when we get to the top and the sea.
400040	403040	Good morning, Mr. Hemiolens.
403040	405040	Morning, moment.
405040	407040	Are your father and mother up?
407040	408040	Yes.
408040	411040	Mama was when I came out.
411040	412040	Good.
412040	416040	I'll never understand how you can sleep for months on end.
416040	417040	We like it.
418040	419040	Oh, yes.
427040	430040	Why do they always have to do something exciting?
433040	435040	What a gorgeous view.
435040	438040	It really is.
438040	441040	Hey, look, they're smoke coming from moment house.
441040	443040	We should have stayed at home.
443040	446040	My bet moment, Mama's cooking something good.
447040	448040	Look.
448040	449040	What is it?
449040	451040	We're not the first here after all.
451040	453040	Look over there.
454040	456040	A top hat.
460040	462040	Hmm, a rather large one.
462040	464040	I wonder who's how it is.
466040	470040	I don't know, but I know papa would like it.
471040	475040	Hmm, it's much too big.
477040	479040	Look.
479040	482040	Oh dear, what's that?
482040	486040	I can really get inside it.
486040	491040	You see, I cover for my old one.
491040	494040	Oh, oh, oh.
494040	498040	Oh, I can't woman it.
498040	500040	Stuck, woman.
504040	506040	No, that's enough nonsense.
506040	509040	I think I'll take it off now.
509040	511040	Oh, damn.
511040	512040	What's the matter?
512040	515040	I can't move it. It's stuck, woman.
518040	520040	I'll give you a hand.
520040	522040	It's harder.
523040	525040	Oh, oh.
527040	528040	Oh, that's better.
528040	529040	Thank you.
529040	531040	What's all this noise?
531040	533040	Papa's head got stuck in the hat, Mama.
533040	535040	Oh, yes, and where did that come from?
535040	536040	Oh, a moment, Mama.
536040	540040	The children found it when they were out and brought it back for me.
540040	543040	It's very smart.
543040	545040	What shall we do with it, Papa?
545040	547040	There is something strange about it.
547040	549040	Shall I throw it away then?
549040	552040	Oh, no. It's too good for that.
552040	554040	Do we know anyone with a very big hand?
554040	557040	No, woman, Papa.
557040	560040	I know what we can do with it.
560040	563040	Oh, it's a...
563040	565040	A waste paper basket, Mama, Mama.
565040	567040	That's right. Well done, Snuffkin.
567040	569040	That was easy.
569040	571040	Come on, Snuffkin.
571040	574040	Come and have some breakfast with us.
580040	582040	Hmm, beautiful.
583040	585040	Hmm, beautiful.
607040	609040	Yes.
610040	613040	Sorry to disturb you, but I'm going to see women.
613040	614040	Uh-huh.
614040	616040	Do you want to come with me, Snork?
616040	617040	Uh-huh.
617040	619040	Or would you rather stay here?
619040	620040	Uh-huh.
620040	622040	Well, are you coming or not?
622040	623040	Uh-huh.
623040	624040	Not coming, man?
624040	625040	Uh-huh.
625040	627040	Snork?
627040	630040	Well, you know my flying ship is almost finished.
630040	632040	It'll be ready this year. You'll see.
632040	635040	This isn't his target moment.
636040	639040	Whoa!
639040	641040	Oh, dear.
641040	644040	Perhaps it needs a little more work.
647040	650040	I wonder if you really can make a flying ship.
650040	652040	Don't be silly, of course you can't.
652040	655040	A little, my Snorks always dreamed about doing it.
655040	658040	Dreams are all right.
658040	661040	Yes, as long as they're not impossible.
661040	663040	I suppose so.
666040	668040	Hmm.
668040	670040	Sniff, you're not still feeding your face, are you?
670040	672040	Do you ever dream, Sniff?
672040	676040	Only nightmares about having no food at all, little my.
683040	685040	Hmm. I wonder who dropped this.
685040	688040	Now where can I put it?
688040	690040	Oh.
690040	693040	There you are. Just a thing.
695040	698040	Oh.
726040	728040	Wow.
728040	730040	Golly, what are they?
730040	731040	They're clouds.
731040	734040	Be careful. Don't touch it. It might be poisonous.
734040	736040	It feels like cotton.
736040	738040	Well, ee!
738040	741040	This is great. I'm floating. Wonderful.
745040	747040	Can I try?
747040	750040	Are you ready, Snork Maiden?
750040	752040	Here we go.
756040	758040	What if you go too high?
758040	761040	My phone.
761040	764040	Wait for me.
764040	767040	Hey, wait for me.
767040	770040	Whoa.
770040	772040	Hey, wait for me.
772040	775040	Hey, wait for me.
775040	777040	Hey, wait for me.
777040	780040	Let me get on.
780040	784040	Ow. Ow. I'm falling.
785040	787040	Ow.
789040	794040	Woman Papa is in his study trying to write his memoirs.
794040	797040	A lot has happened to him over the years.
797040	799040	An awful lot.
799040	802040	And he's trying to remember it.
808040	811040	What was that?
812040	813040	Woman.
813040	814040	Hi, Papa.
814040	816040	What are you doing out there?
816040	817040	We're flying.
817040	820040	The clouds just came out of the house.
820040	824040	Try and get nearer so I can reach you.
824040	826040	No, I'm alright.
826040	828040	Why don't you come for a ride?
828040	829040	Stop. Wait a minute.
829040	832040	It's great. You feel like a bird.
832040	834040	Woman.
834040	837040	Come on, Papa. Jump or you'll fall.
837040	838040	It's alright.
838040	839040	Oh.
839040	840040	What?
840040	842040	Oh.
845040	847040	Woman, Mama, quickly.
847040	848040	What's the matter?
848040	850040	Have you seen what the children are doing?
850040	851040	Yes.
851040	854040	Look at them. They're flying about on clouds.
854040	855040	It can't be safe.
855040	858040	Don't worry, Papa. It's alright.
858040	862040	I told them to be careful.
863040	865040	Come on, Snapping.
866040	868040	To go out.
868040	871040	I won, I won.
871040	873040	Whoa. Hey, wait a minute.
873040	875040	Little cloud. Wait for me.
875040	877040	Don't go away.
877040	879040	Oh, I got you.
879040	880040	That is tree cotton.
880040	881040	I'm going to climb right up here.
881040	883040	And I'm going to get you right there.
883040	884040	This branch. Come on.
884040	885040	Come on, little cloud.
885040	886040	I'm going to take you with me.
886040	887040	Here, come on.
887040	889040	You just keep coming back here.
889040	890040	Yeah.
890040	891040	I got you now.
891040	892040	You are going to get away from me.
892040	893040	Here I go.
893040	894040	Come on.
894040	895040	All of that ledge.
895040	896040	Come on.
896040	897040	Stop.
897040	898040	I want you to play.
898040	899040	Oh.
899040	900040	Oh.
906040	907040	Oh, boy. What's happening?
907040	909040	My cloud's starting to go.
909040	910040	Oh.
910040	911040	Whoa. Whoa.
911040	912040	That was fun.
912040	913040	Yeah, it was.
913040	914040	But I wasn't ready to stop.
914040	915040	Look.
915040	917040	There's movement in Snork Maiden.
917040	918040	Hey.
918040	922040	Why have they still got cloud snuffed in?
922040	924040	There's a starting to go as well.
924040	926040	I think they'd better get off.
926040	927040	Hey.
938040	939040	Right.
939040	940040	I'll start counting.
940040	945040	One, two, three.
946040	948040	Do you want something little mind?
948040	949040	Oh, yes.
949040	950040	A place to hide.
962040	964040	Boy, I don't think there's any place to hide.
964040	965040	And here is there.
965040	966040	No.
966040	969040	Oh, it's too dirty in there.
969040	971040	I'm going to have.
971040	972040	I know.
972040	973040	I'll hide in the head.
976040	977040	Oh.
981040	984040	One, two, one, two, one.
987040	988040	Hey.
992040	993040	Hey.
997040	998040	Huh?
999040	1000040	Huh?
1012040	1013040	Gotcha.
1021040	1022040	Snork Maiden.
1029040	1030040	Snork Maiden.
1035040	1036040	Hey.
1040040	1041040	Baaah!
1041040	1043040	Baaah!
1043040	1046040	Movement must be around here somewhere.
1046040	1050040	Well, last time I saw him, he was hiding in the fireplace.
1050040	1051040	Have you found him yet?
1051040	1052040	No.
1052040	1054040	Have you looked in the cellar?
1054040	1055040	Yes, I have.
1058040	1059040	Wait a minute.
1059040	1060040	Did you hear someone laughing?
1060040	1061040	Where'd it come from?
1061040	1064040	Gee, I better go home.
1064040	1066040	Oh, is there anything wrong?
1066040	1067040	Yes.
1067040	1069040	I can't find moment anywhere.
1069040	1071040	Well, he's too fat to be most places.
1075040	1077040	He's coming from under the hat.
1083040	1085040	Well, here I am, sniff.
1085040	1087040	Who on earth are you?
1087040	1089040	Ha, ha, ha, ha.
1089040	1091040	I won, and didn't I?
1091040	1093040	You looked everywhere in the house,
1093040	1095040	and you couldn't find me, couldn't you?
1095040	1096040	So I won.
1096040	1098040	Who'd want to find you anyway?
1098040	1101040	Well, you were trying hard enough, weren't you?
1101040	1103040	What is this, a new game?
1103040	1105040	My name's Snork Maiden.
1105040	1106040	What's yours?
1106040	1108040	I'm the king of Movement Valley.
1108040	1110040	My pretty one.
1110040	1113040	You're too ugly to be the king of anything.
1114040	1115040	Well, now.
1115040	1118040	That's not a very nice thing to say to your friend.
1118040	1119040	Is it, Papa?
1119040	1123040	Now, you'd better tell me what you have done with Movement.
1123040	1124040	But I'm here.
1124040	1125040	Where?
1125040	1126040	Right here.
1126040	1127040	Who are you?
1127040	1130040	And where is Movement?
1134040	1135040	Papa.
1135040	1137040	I'm certainly not your Papa.
1137040	1138040	Yes, you are.
1138040	1139040	Come on.
1139040	1140040	I'm Movement.
1140040	1142040	I don't know who you are.
1142040	1143040	I'm not Movement.
1143040	1146040	He's nice and handsome and nothing like you.
1146040	1149040	Have you looked at yourself in a mirror?
1149040	1150040	Ah!
1150040	1152040	But where's my nose gone?
1152040	1154040	Oh, there's nothing there anymore.
1154040	1155040	Ah!
1155040	1156040	Ah!
1156040	1157040	Oh no!
1157040	1158040	My tail's all pushy!
1158040	1159040	Ah!
1159040	1160040	Oh!
1167040	1169040	This is terrible!
1170040	1171040	Oh!
1175040	1177040	Who are you?
1177040	1179040	What have you done with me?
1179040	1181040	It must be a nightmare!
1181040	1183040	I want to come back!
1183040	1186040	Go away, you're horrible!
1186040	1189040	Dear me, what's all this noise?
1189040	1191040	What's happened?
1191040	1193040	Mama!
1193040	1195040	Mama!
1195040	1196040	Mama!
1196040	1198040	What earth is this?
1198040	1201040	This is Movement, but just look at him.
1201040	1204040	You don't look like I'm Movement.
1204040	1205040	I am, I am.
1205040	1207040	Please believe me, Mama.
1207040	1209040	I am Movement.
1209040	1211040	Well, I don't know.
1211040	1212040	I'm sure.
1212040	1214040	Something's happened to me.
1214040	1216040	Why do I look so different?
1216040	1218040	Now then calm down.
1218040	1219040	This won't help at all.
1219040	1221040	We don't need all this noise.
1221040	1225040	If you really are Movement, then everything will be alright.
1225040	1228040	Just give me a minute or two and I'll know.
1228040	1230040	Mama, call me Movement, please.
1230040	1232040	I don't know what's happened, but I am me.
1232040	1234040	Honestly, I am.
1234040	1236040	Mama, please believe me.
1236040	1237040	I am Movement.
1237040	1239040	Let me see.
1239040	1241040	Oh, Mama, you do know it's me.
1241040	1242040	You must.
1242040	1244040	You can forget your little movement.
1244040	1246040	Please, Mama, please, Mama.
1246040	1249040	Oh, hush now, hush now.
1256040	1259040	Mama!
1262040	1266040	Yes, you're my little movement alright.
1266040	1269040	Oh, Mama!
1280040	1282040	Oh.
1286040	1288040	Oh, Movement.
1288040	1290040	Papa.
1290040	1292040	Oh, Movement, my boy.
1292040	1294040	Where were you hiding?
1294040	1296040	In there.
1296040	1299040	In the hat?
1305040	1309040	Let's hope it's the last we'll see of it.
1310040	1313040	Movement, Papa, decided that although it was a fine hat,
1313040	1315040	it was too dangerous to keep.
1315040	1319040	So, Movement threw it in the river and it floated away.
1319040	1321040	He wasn't too sure about it though,
1321040	1325040	because it was a rather special hat.
1327040	1333040	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1334040	1341040	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1341040	1345040	They're always happy and always at play.
1345040	1348040	The movements are having fun day after day.
1348040	1352040	The movements.
1352040	1356040	The movements.
1356040	1362040	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
1363040	1370040	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
1370040	1374040	They're always happy and always at play.
1374040	1378040	The movements are having fun day after day.
1378040	1381040	The movements.
1381040	1385040	The movements.
1385040	1391040	The movements.
1393040	1397040	The movements.
