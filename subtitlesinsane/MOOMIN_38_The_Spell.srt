1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're here for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm not sure.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm not sure.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. with me, they're for you on your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,840
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land, you can fly

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:47,000
just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there was the moments

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There was the moments, there was the moments

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There was the moments, there was the moments Oh, my God.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, no.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, oh. Oh.

17
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,199
Oh. Oh Oh, oh. The witch has come to Moomin Valley.

18
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,360
What could she be up to this time?

19
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,800
Eldritch cabal assume! Eldritch cabal assume!

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,439
Eldritch cabal assume! Eldritch cabal assume!

21
00:02:23,439 --> 00:03:07,000
Eldritch cabal assume! Eldritch cabal assume! Eldritch cabal assume! Eldritch cabal assume! Elderscapella Zoom! Yeah, I must get a covered brown. What? The Great Thaw had come at last.

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The Moomin Valley.

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I think I can smell spring.

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, I've never seen anything like this one before.

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hello there, Mr. Hemmielun.

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hello, Sniff, you're up early this year?

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes, I think I've even beat Mom and do it.

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a great day. Hello there Mr. Hemiellon. Hello Sniff, you're up early this year?

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes, I think I've even beat Momen to it.

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Is that so? Why are the Momen so late this year?

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Momen, wake up! Sprig is here! It's time to wake up!

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,400
Momen! Maybe Snorkmaiden's easier to wake up! Sprig is here! It's time to wake up! Moment!

33
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,900
Maybe Snork made it easier to wake up.

34
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Snork me in!

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,199
And I thought I was difficult to wake up. I must get closer.

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What are you doing, Sniff? What am I doing? You can see, can't you? Of course I can, but why are you climbing up that? Mom and his fart maintenance still asleep. I have to wake them up.

37
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Why don't you go this way? It's easier!

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Ugh! What I do now!

39
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Funny, even momentary.

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm not going to be able to do it.

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm not going to be able to do it. Uh! What I do now!

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Funny even Mom and Mom is still asleep.

43
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Wrong room.

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Come on, wake up lazy bones.

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Moment, spring has come.

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We'll look at that. Wake up, you sleepyhead. Oh, you really are impossible.

47
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Moment, moment, moment. This is odd, even for a moment.

48
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,920
Open the window, little mind!

49
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,120
Was I scared?

50
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,680
Ooh, I haven't you opened them up!

51
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,560
I've tried, but they won't.

52
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,199
You're kidding.

53
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,160
No one can resist this little mime.

54
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,759
Wake up, oh man.

55
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,360
I know you're ticklish.

56
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,879
Oh man, oh man!

57
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,040
I told you so.

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh man, come on! I told you so. Moment!

59
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Come on!

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Ow!

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Ow!

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Ow!

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Ow!

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Ow!

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Ow!

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I can't stop.

67
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
How strange.

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How sad.

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What do you mean?

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I think... You know what? You don don't think, it's hard to tell.

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I was listening for his heartbeat.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He's still breathing.

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And snort made it.

74
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Wake up you slug of it!

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Snort made it!

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,199
They won't wake up. This is strange. Wake up, you slug of it! Stop, me!

77
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,399
They won't wake up.

78
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,519
This is strange.

79
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,920
Why don't we go and try the other?

80
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,360
Yes, why not?

81
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,079
I hate it when others are asleep while I'm up.

82
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,720
But then I don't like it much the other way around either.

83
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
Do I sniff?

84
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,360
Moment drop up, please wake up.

85
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,000
We've tried to wake up, Moment, but he won't. Wakey, Moment, mom, I breakfast time. Come on, Moment Pop, please wake up! We've tried to wake up, Moment, but he woo!

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Wakey, Moment, Moment breakfast time!

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Come on, Moment Pop, boy!

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Wake up! This is no use!

89
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Goodness, it seems the Moments are still hibernating.

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And so is Snort Maiden. That's odd, she always wakes up even before me. Goodness, it seems the Moomins are still hibernating.

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And so is Snort Maiden.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's odd, she always wakes up even before me.

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, Moomin' too, but this year it seems to be different.

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,639
I'll go back home, and I'll come over again in a little while when the Moomin' family

95
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,639
will have woken up.

96
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,639
If they ever do.

97
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,639
Huh?

98
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,500
We've tried everything to wake them up short of buckets of water and there's no moving them.

99
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,000
We've shouted and shook and pissed and tickled and stopped!

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh dear!

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's not just strange, it's ominous!

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh my, surely not.

103
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Hello, everybody!

104
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How is everyone?

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What is it?

106
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You all look very scared.

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,199
Eh?

108
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,199
Still hibernating?

109
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
It's all very strange, have you lint?

110
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Moment!

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,800
See?

112
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes indeed.

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
All we can really do. Who is waiting?

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I suppose you're right.

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Don't worry. The days are getting longer all the time now.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So the moment can't sleep much longer.

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Unsnort maiden?

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Cheat too, of course.

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Bet you anything, moment wakes up when Snuffkin returns.

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I think you're right, Sniff.

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And then, one day about a week later,

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:09:53,500
Snuffkin did come back from his yearly trip south. I Snowden! Snowden! Hmm.

123
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Where's Moomin? He's in bad.

124
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Moomin's still asleep.

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:10,000
A sleep. They won't wake up no matter what you do.

126
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What do you think, Snuffkin?

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think they're very sick.

128
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's a possibility.

129
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Sleeping sickness, perhaps?

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's very difficult to say.

131
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
To me, though, if you want my honest opinion,

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,379
I think somebody has cast a very nasty spell

133
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:27,379
on them.

134
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:28,379
A spell?

135
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,720
But who would do that?

136
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
I think I know.

137
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Huh?

138
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,360
Are you mean the witch?

139
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,519
Alice is grandmother, but why?

140
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,360
To tell you the truth, I haven't the biggest idea.

141
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,879
How do we find out?

142
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,600
I'll go to the forest and see her.

143
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,600
And if she did cast a spell, do you think she'd tell you?

144
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,399
I really don't know, but we have to do something.

145
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,399
We can't just leave them sleeping here forever.

146
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,600
I'll go with you.

147
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,799
I guess I better stay here to take care of things.

148
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, if they suddenly wake up, somebody needs to be here.

149
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,700
Snuffkin.

150
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,500
Huh?

151
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
That's him!

152
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,700
At last!

153
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,700
Moving.

154
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,700
Moving?

155
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,700
Moving?

156
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,500
He's dreaming.

157
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,000
Just looking at him makes me feel sleepy.

158
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:46,000
Moving, I promise to get this horrible spell cast off for you. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

159
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh, my God.

160
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, my God.

161
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh, my God.

162
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Oh, my God.

163
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh, my God.

164
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh, my God.

165
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Where are you going?

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I've done all the chores, even washed out your old push-in jars.

167
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So where are you going? I've done all the chores, even washed out your old potion jars.

168
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So where are you going?

169
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Spring is here, Grandma. I thought I'd take some time off to celebrate.

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But what about your work?

171
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm just going out for the day, Grandma.

172
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And I know where.

173
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I only want to see the Moomins.

174
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
They're still hibernating.

175
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No, they're not. It isn't winter anymore.

176
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Winter or spring, I happen to know the mommens are still asleep.

177
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
How could you know what the mommens are up to, Grandma?

178
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Hm. Oh, which is no everything, my dear girl.

179
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Really? Well, I'll go and see.

180
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Come here.

181
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,080
I have to admit that I can't help being worried about the moments. Their windows are open for the spring.

182
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,759
So they can smell the first spring flowers.

183
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:05,000
Well, I suppose I'd best be getting on. Why didn't you tell them about the witch in the spell?

184
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Well after all that was just an idea I got.

185
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Ideas can be embarrassing if you were wrong, so don't tell anyone for the time being.

186
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
All right.

187
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm going.

188
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And I'm leaving too.

189
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Okay.

190
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,580
There's Alicia. And I'm leaving too. Okay.

191
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,080
There's Alicia.

192
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,779
Hi, everyone. It's me.

193
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:37,179
Why do you get a teller? We better tell of the truth, I guess.

194
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The best thing would be for me to talk to her first. Yes, I agree. She's unbelievable, how kuchy!

195
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I can hardly believe you could be so mean, grandma! Calm down, my dear!

196
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Why, I did it all for you, Alicia!

197
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You did it for me!

198
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
If the moments are asleep, why should you go there?

199
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Do them a world of good, too, along sleep!

200
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
How would you do that? I'm it for me! If the moments are asleep, why should you go there?

201
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,500
Do them a world of good, too, along sleep!

202
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,000
How ridiculous, grandmother!

203
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,500
Alicia, you've done quite well in your studies, and if you keep at it,

204
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,000
I see no reason why you shouldn't be a fully-fledged witch before 30.

205
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And if I do see the moments, I won't be a witch till I'm 31, is that what you mean?

206
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:31,600
Now, the moments are very bad, and the l ones on you, they are so disgustingly good, and if you want to be a witch, you mustn't see them.

207
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,000
Hmm...

208
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,000
And if I promise never to go near Moomin Valley again, will you lift the spell, Grandma?

209
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,080
Good girl, that's exactly what I wanted here. You promised me that, Alicia.

210
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,279
I promise, Grandma.

211
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,559
Right. The spell should be lifted.

212
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,679
Snuff guard.

213
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,600
What do you want?

214
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,919
There are two different ways of lifting the spell I cast on the movements.

215
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,720
Uh-huh.

216
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,440
The first one is that I go to Moomin Valley myself

217
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,159
and chant the magic words outside their bedroom window.

218
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:03,799
Hey, Grandma, that's not a good idea.

219
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:09,440
Oh, oh, you mean people who might be upset about me casting a spell on the moments?

220
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,440
You may be right.

221
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,919
So therefore, Snuff Kid, I have no choice but to ask you to perform the task.

222
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,240
Oh, but why me?

223
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,960
You do have your harmonica with you?

224
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
Of course.

225
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,600
Let me have it, please.

226
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,240
Eldritch Cabalasome, Eldritch Cabalasome, Eldritch Cabalasome, Eldritch Cabalasome. Eldritch Cabalasome, Eldritch Cabalasome.

227
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Eldritch Cabalasome, Eldritch Cabalasome.

228
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Eldritch Cabalasome, Eldritch Cabalasome, Eldritch Cabalasome.

229
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,399
If you don't stop staring at me, my witchcraft won't be effective.

230
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,919
Alicia, get me the next potion now.

231
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,759
Oh.

232
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,679
Oh.

233
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:47,000
All right, grandmother.

234
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Eldridge Cabalazone, Eldridge Cabalazone, Eldridge Cabalazone. Oh, she can't do it if we look at her, huh?

235
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Now, listen, Inspector, you must do something.

236
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You are the police, aren't you?

237
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Well, I have to tell you, waking people up is not really part of our job.

238
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,879
But you're our last hope inspector you must do something

239
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,240
Perhaps if you could possibly use your whistle to wake them up. Uh-huh. It's very shrill indoors good Friday

240
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:29,000
No, and fire your revolver. I'm sure that would do it in specter. I don't carry guns. They're dangerous. Oh, dear.

241
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Hey, Snuffkin! Little Y!

242
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He sounds worried, I bet they're still fast asleep.

243
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Hmm.

244
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Right, Snuffkin?

245
00:16:42,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Get on with it. It's not working, is it? Get my pants, nap.

246
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Snuck in! Snork made on!

247
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Wake up!

248
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Spring is here!

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Come on!

250
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,500
Ah! Hmm...

251
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Hmm...

252
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,500
Ah...

253
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Oh, spring is here already.

254
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,000
Good morning, Papa Deer.

255
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,500
Hmm, good morning.

256
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,000
I have a feeling we've over-slaped.

257
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,500
I wonder whether the others are up yet.

258
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh, she's made of full of those nuffkin.

259
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm shut up, Sniff.

260
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Maybe she forgot how to cast off the spell.

261
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Hi, Snuffkin!

262
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Hi!

263
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Good morning!

264
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Good morning, everybody!

265
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hi, Snuffkin!

266
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm so glad you were right back already, Snuffkin.

267
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes!

268
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You woke up early too!

269
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Did you hear that?

270
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's you that woke up late, Moonman!

271
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Who me?

272
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Hmm?

273
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Ah!

274
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Now I say, Moonman's already up about!

275
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What?

276
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,700
I snore!

277
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
Oh, it's you, you're awake!

278
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,700
I'm glad I didn't blow my whistle!

279
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,200
But we did have a reason to be worried, Inspector.

280
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
He's right, what about Moom and Mama?

281
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
And Moom and Papa?

282
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,700
Hello there, everybody.

283
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,700
Is anything the matter?

284
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,200
Nothing at all!

285
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
There are weak!

286
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,000
Oh, dear, I don't understand!

287
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You don't understand words!

288
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
We were very worried because you just wouldn't wake up!

289
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Oh really, you do know we always have a night, don't you?

290
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Sleep all winter and we always wake up in this room!

291
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Of course, of course, but this year, start your turn!

292
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Right, well we did have a bit of a problem.

293
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You see, Moomin Papa, we couldn't swim!

294
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,160
Snuffkin! Back all right ass.

295
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,359
Why don't you listen to us mimin papa?

296
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:12,839
Very well. Why don't you all come in and we'll have a nice cup of tea.

297
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:15,680
And we can discuss your problem properly.

298
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,519
But it's your problem I'm afraid not ours.

299
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:22,119
What does he mean? We don't have a problem doing.

300
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:28,059
Please do come in anyway everybody. Please. you too, all of you come in.

301
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:29,660
Come in, everybody.

302
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,980
I'm on the side. I'm in Georgia.

303
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:48,000
Whatever happens to us this year. Hey, Snuffkin?

304
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Alicia!

305
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh, man! We've come to see you, Alicia.

306
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That was nice of you.

307
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Your grandmother isn't home, is she?

308
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No. Then we can play hideous games. Come in! We've come to see you, Alicia. That was nice of you.

309
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Your grandmother isn't home, is she?

310
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
No.

311
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Then we can play hide and seek.

312
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I can't.

313
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I promise Grandma there.

314
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yes, I know.

315
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Snuff can tell me.

316
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That was a really great thing to do.

317
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But you didn't promise not to see us.

318
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You just promised not to go to Mom and Valley, didn't you?

319
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah.

320
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,279
And listen, you never promised not to play with us either, did you?

321
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,279
No.

322
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:31,319
So if we came here to see you instead of you to us,

323
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,960
then it's all right, and you don't have to break your promise.

324
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Oh, I suppose so.

325
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,839
Yes, I suppose you're right.

326
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,759
Well, let's play.

327
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:40,359
Yeah.

328
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,359
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

329
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:47,000
13, 4, 3, 5, 8.

330
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That afternoon they all had the most wonderful time playing hide and seek in the woods.

331
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Hi, Jule.

332
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Pre- your tins are my six seven. And... We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements

333
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
They're always happy and goes at play

334
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The Moons are having fun day after day, the Moons

335
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The Moons

336
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
The Moons The Moon, the Moon, the Moon.
