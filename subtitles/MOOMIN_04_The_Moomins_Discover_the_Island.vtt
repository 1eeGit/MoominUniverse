00:00.000 --> 00:20.800
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with

00:20.800 --> 00:33.040
me here for you on your TV they are the movements they are the movements so come with me give me your hand

00:33.040 --> 00:42.000
I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just like a bird sing that song ever there with the

00:42.000 --> 00:56.640
movements there was the movements there was the movements there was the

La la la la la una la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
And you know how hungry the sea air made you all last time we went out on a boat.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
You'd have been glad of food then.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
You got to rough it a bit if you want an adventure.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Yes, but it will be more fun with coffee and pancakes.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Aren't you two ready yet?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Hello, Mummin!

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Hi, Snorgvagan!

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Must you use that ladder?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
I'm all right.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Mummin, you're going to hurt yourself one of these days.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
It's good practice. It's Snorg coming with us.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
He says he hasn't got time for sailing boats at the moment.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
I'd much rather a real sailing boat than a paper flying ship any day.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Are Mumma and Papa ready yet?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
They're packing up half the kitchen.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Oh, it's too full.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Have we got to take all that with us?

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Mumma thinks it's better to be safe than sorry and she's usually right.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Tell me, Mummin, where exactly are we going?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
We haven't decided yet.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
That's right. Wait and see.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Let's see.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Mr. Hamulin?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Have you found a rare plan for your collection yet?

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
Unfortunately not. There are lots of these in Mummin Valley already.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Goodness, where are you taking all that?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
We're going sailing.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Have exciting, charting new seas and exploring desert islands.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Never know.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
If I help you load up the boat, can I please come with you?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Captain the bridge!

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Man the yard arm!

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Hankers away!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Sailors beware!

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Spikes the manbrace!

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
All hands on deck!

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Full speed ahead!

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Hey, Sniff. Any sun in the movements?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Not yet.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
It's a great day to go sailing.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I wonder where we're going.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
I don't have any idea.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Hmm, I don't actually like sailing much.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Do you get sick?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Well, not really sick.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
It's just that I can't swim.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
And if it's rough, it frightens me and I panic a bit.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
It looks like it's going to stay calm.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
So don't worry.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Right, that's the lot.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Now all aboard.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
Mama, little Mai, Sniffkin, Mummin, Snork Maiden,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
and Mr. Hamulin, of course.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Isn't he a bit old for adventures?

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
Not at all. No, Mummin Papa has promised to find a deserted island

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
where I shall search for rare plants.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Come on, Sniff, hurry up!

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
There's no rum.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Don't be silly, Sniff. Of course there is.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
It looks very full, almost thinking.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
There's no way this boat could sink.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Now come on, get him.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Really?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
I promise it'll be all right.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Won't it, Papa?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Well, if it stays like this, it will, Mummin.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I'll come next time.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Let's go, Mummin Papa.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
He's just a scaredy cat.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
We'll go without you then, Sniff.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I think that will be best.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Anyway, someone had better stay and look after Mummin House,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
and it might just as well be me.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
That's very thoughtful of you.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
There's a pancake on the kitchen table that you can have for lunch.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Thank you, Mummin, Mama. Have a nice trip.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I wish Sniff had come.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
He's a big softy.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Well, he's not very good at swimming,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
and he doesn't eat rather a lot.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
What?

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
This is the life, isn't it, Mama?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
It certainly is, dear.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Oh, look, not a breath of wind.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Shall I start rowing, Papa?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Yes, you'd better get Sniffkin to help you.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Aye-aye, Captain.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
It's hardly moving.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
You'll have to do better than that.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
We're doing our best.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
You two would be useless as Gally's slaves,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
and you'd have to do your best to help them.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
We're doing our best.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
You two would be useless as Gally's slaves,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
and you'd have to do your best to help them.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
You two would be useless as Gally's slaves.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
It's good that we're not then, isn't it?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
So then, what's your excuse?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
It's not easy rowing against the tide.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
You try it.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
No, dear, at this rate, I should be lucky to find one rare plant.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
Well, Mr. Hamlin, you could always try collecting some seaweed instead.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
There's plenty of that.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I have heard tales that if you whistle,

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
those who perished at sea will send you a wind.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Land! Hoi! Look, Moomin, Papa!

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
That's too small to be any good.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
You're right.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Hey, look, Papa. We're moving again.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
The tide's turned and the winds up.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
What a beautiful island!

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
And a perfect place to land, too.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Oh, I bet this place has got some rare plants.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
Be careful when you explore. There could be wild animals there.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Now, if someone will go and collect some wood, I'll get a fire started.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
I've had none of you will say no to coffee and pancakes.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Watch me, you land lovers. I'll go and pull the boat ashore.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Hmm, I suppose you're right. This will come in handy.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
As I said, Papa, it's always better to rough it with a little bit of luxury.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
I wonder if we're the first to set foot on the island.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Thank you, children.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Is there anything else you want us to do?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
No, I don't think so.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Is it okay if I go explore the island?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Of course, off you go.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Coming, snort, Maiden.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I'll stay and help Moomin Mama with the cooking.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Mama, you said we needed firewood. Is this enough?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
My goodness for a lot.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
You know, I don't think anyone lives on this island.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
I haven't seen anyone unless they're hiding in the bushes.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I've seen someone.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Oh, yeah? Who?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Well, they weren't very big.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
What do you mean, this big?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Well, same as me.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
What did they look like?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Sort of white and ghostly and not very friendly looking either, Moomin.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
Well, you probably just thought you saw something a little, Maiden.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I did see them. I did too.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
Keep your hair on. I'm not saying you didn't see anything.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Goodness, this is magnificent.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Oh, what a find.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
And what's this?

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
Oh, well.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Well, well, well.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
I've never seen such rare and beautiful plants.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Oh.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Well, what's this? Goodness, it's a perimeter.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
Now, let's see. Rain and storm. Probably broken.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Oh, hello. Who are you?

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
Oh, I see. This is your perimeter, isn't it? Now, watch it.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Mind you don't travel on those flowers, will you?

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Oh, no, no, no. They're coming to get me.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
Don't go away. Don't go away.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
I think what little my saw was a hatty fattener.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
They're not ghosts. Are they snuffkin?

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
No, they look kind of like it, but they're really harmless enough.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Oh, leave me alone.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Oh, dear. What on earth was that?

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
It sounded like Mr. Himulet.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
Don't get away. Oh, help me, please.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
That's it. That's what I saw.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
It's Mr. Himulet.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Help! Get me down.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
Why are they after you, Mr. Himulet? What'd you do to them?

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
I don't know. I just tapped on this post and asked them to be careful.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Is that what I saw? It's Mr. Himulet.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Help! Get me down.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Why are they after you, Mr. Himulet? What'd you do to them?

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
I just tapped on this post and asked them to be careful.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Is that ours? They seem a bit angry to me.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
Well, then I tapped the marrometer to check the weather and they came at me.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Well, I don't think it's a flower's a mad about.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Maybe they thought you were trying to steal the marrometer.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
I don't want it to keep it. My goodness, I'm collecting flowers, not marrometers.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Well, hang on.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
I can't hang on much longer. Hurry, please.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
They don't look so easily frightened.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
No, now let me think.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
Hurry, I'm slipping.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I've got it, Mr. Himulet.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
The haddifatators can't see or hear very well, but they are very sensitive.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
We'll have to try and frighten them.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
I suggest you shake the post as hard as you can.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Like this.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Harder. Harder, Mr. Himulet.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Look, they can feel the ground moving.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Keep going, Mr. Himulet.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
I'm getting really tired.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I'm exhausted, I can't.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
They're not going.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Are you sure this will work?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
You can stop now, Mr. Himulet.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Mr. Himulet.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Hey, are you all right, Mr. Himulet?

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
What disgusting creatures.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
I have a good mind to take their precious barometer.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I don't think that's such a good idea.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
It's no good anyway, it's not working.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
How do you know that, Mr. Himulet?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Look, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
But according to this barometer, it should be pouring down with rain.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
This is the way to explore real home cooking.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
It just takes a little thought.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
And woman papa is always prepared, aren't you dear?

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
Double zero, it can't get any lower than that.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
What does that mean?

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
If it was working, it would mean we'd be in for a terrible storm.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
I think the reading might be right after all, Mr. Himulet.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
See the way the sky is darkening.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Look at those storm clouds.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
We better go before it's too late.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
But there won't be time to get home.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
We'll be shipwreck, woman papa.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Surely there's still time.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
We don't want to go back to moving valley yet.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
We've only explored half the island.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
Besides, you never know what we might find, Snort Maiden.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
I wanted to get my hands on those happy fat nurse.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
That's the last thing I wanted to do, little mind, the very last.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I think we ought to leave now.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
What do you think, mama?

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Well, you're the captain, dear. It's up to you.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
So I am. Now, let me think.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Oh.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Right, we'll stay.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Oh, can we?

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Yes, but we must put the tent up before it starts raining.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
What tent?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Always be prepared.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
That's my motto.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
You're very clever to think of everything.

17:07.000 --> 17:13.000
First, we must lower the sails and pull the boat up so that she's out of harm's way.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
That should do it.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Well done, everybody.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
It should be safe here.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Now hurry with the tent, the storm's nearly here.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Are you all right, Mr. Himulan?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
You stay here and rest, eh?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
We'll manage without you.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I am a bit tired.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
You get your breath back first, but don't forget to tie the boat to that tree before you come up.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
It looks bad. A real humdinger.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
You can touch me.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Right, let's get that tent up.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Oh, dear, what a day.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Oh, what's this here?

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
Oh, yes.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
Well, fancy that I've never seen one of these before.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Snuffkin?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
What's happening?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
It's coming really fast.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Look at the rain over the sea.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
We're going to get soaked if we stay here.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Just a minute.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
But we'll get wet.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I know, but it's so exciting.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Huh?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Things which you have no control over.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
You can see this great big storm coming towards you,

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
and you can't do anything about it.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
No.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
You have to time it just right.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
When to make a run for shelter, you mean?

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I knew you'd understand.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I wonder what the Hattie Fatterners are doing.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Waiting for the thunderstorm.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Why?

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
Because they get energy from the electricity and the lightning.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Really?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
That's it!

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Come on!

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
I've never seen rain like this.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
It'll be over soon enough, Momen.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
You're dressed, Mom.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
I know.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
It's all right.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
I know.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
I know.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
I know.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
I know.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
I know.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
I know.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
I know.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
I know.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
I know.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
I know.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
I know.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
I know.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
I know.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
I know.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
It's all right.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I'll look after you.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
It's all right.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
It's all right.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
I know.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
It's all right.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
It's all right.

20:45.000 --> 21:11.960
that was a close one too close I think it's over snort maiden what a

21:11.960 --> 21:33.360
find I made today

21:33.360 --> 21:38.280
if like the movements and their friends you're stranded on the desert island in a

21:38.280 --> 21:44.120
huge storm all you can do is wait until it's blown itself out but what if the

21:44.120 --> 21:49.720
waves are so high that your boat has caught up and washed out to sea that is a

21:49.720 --> 21:53.160
different story altogether

22:08.680 --> 22:16.840
they love the laughter and they love the living the movements believing in

22:16.840 --> 22:25.720
sharing and caring and giving the movements they're always happy and always

22:25.720 --> 22:39.000
they're always happy and always at play the movements are having fun day after day the

22:39.000 --> 22:45.080

22:45.080 --> 22:54.520
believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements they're always happy and

always at play the movements are having fun day after day the movements the movements
