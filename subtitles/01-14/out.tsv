0	21000	Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me.
21000	29000	Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements.
29000	35000	So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land.
35000	46000	You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there were the movements,
46000	58000	there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements.
76000	83000	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-a!
98000	104000	Have you ever heard of Moon and Valley?
104000	112000	Deep white snow covers the whole valley, and everyone goes to sleep so that they keep warm.
115000	118000	Look, there's a woman house.
123000	126000	There's a woman, our hero.
126000	129000	A woman, a woman, a woman.
132000	135000	A woman, a woman.
136000	139000	A woman, a woman.
141000	146000	And this little bundle must be little my.
146000	153000	I think before our story starts, we better wake everyone up with some spring sunshine.
177000	178000	Oh!
192000	195000	At last! It's spring!
198000	202000	Wake up, everyone! It's spring time!
207000	210000	A woman, a woman.
214000	216000	A woman.
216000	218000	Oh, little my, you're up.
218000	221000	It's hard to stay asleep with you yelling.
221000	224000	I can't help it if I'm happy.
224000	226000	So yeah, woke me.
226000	229000	I was having a lovely dream about living in a watermelon.
229000	231000	But it's beautiful outside.
231000	234000	Oh, gee, isn't. Is it really, woman?
234000	238000	Yes, it's all fresh. The flowers are out and the sun is shining.
239000	241000	So, I like being asleep.
241000	245000	But it's spring. You said you wanted me to wake you as soon as spring was here.
245000	247000	Oh, boy, did I?
247000	252000	Yes, you did, little my. You said you wanted to be a welcome as soon as spring was here.
252000	255000	Really? Yes, you did.
255000	257000	Did I say something like that?
257000	262000	You can go back to bed if you want to. Nobody's making you get up, little my.
262000	266000	No, there's really no point, movement. I'm not sleepy anymore.
266000	269000	Well, there you are then.
269000	271000	Mama!
271000	273000	Good spring, movement.
273000	277000	Movement, mama. I'm starving. Have you got any watermelon?
277000	280000	No, but there's lots of other things.
280000	284000	We'll all have a nice big breakfast.
288000	291000	I can hear a snuffkin.
292000	295000	Good spring.
305000	309000	Wouldn't it be quicker to use the stairs?
309000	311000	More fun this way.
311000	314000	Are you going home now?
314000	318000	Yes, thanks very much for letting me spend the winter here.
318000	323000	Don't think your sister will be back yet, though. I'll go anyway.
329000	331000	Snuffkin!
331000	333000	Oh, hello, movement.
333000	336000	It's really good to see you, snuffkin.
336000	337000	And you too?
337000	338000	You're back, Arley.
338000	340000	Aren't you having a good time?
340000	342000	Yes, I was.
342000	344000	But I didn't want to miss spring time in movement valley.
344000	347000	What did you do?
347000	349000	I'll tell you later.
349000	352000	Let's go wake up, Snuff, and think of something exciting to do.
352000	355000	I don't think I'll like it.
363000	368000	He's still snoring, movement. I'll do it again.
371000	374000	Well, that's done it.
375000	379000	Come on, Snuff, it's spring. Snuffkin's here.
379000	381000	Please go away, you two.
381000	384000	We're going to do something really exciting.
384000	386000	Like what, moment?
386000	389000	I can think of more exciting things to do than this.
389000	393000	Well, let's imagine that we're the first ever to climb this mountain.
393000	395000	It's such a clear day.
395000	399000	We'll be able to see all of movement valley when we get to the top and the sea.
400000	403000	Good morning, Mr. Emulance.
403000	405000	Morning, moment.
405000	407000	Are your father and mother up?
407000	408000	Yes.
408000	410000	Mama was when I came out.
410000	412000	Good.
412000	416000	I'll never understand how you can sleep for months on end.
416000	417000	We like it.
417000	419000	Oh, yes.
427000	431000	Why do they always have to do something exciting?
433000	436000	What a gorgeous view.
436000	438000	It really is.
438000	442000	Hey, look, they're smoke coming from moment house.
442000	444000	We should have stayed at home.
444000	447000	The moment Mama's cooking something good.
447000	448000	Look.
448000	449000	What is it?
449000	451000	We're not the first here after all.
451000	453000	Look over there.
454000	456000	A top hat.
459000	462000	Hmm, a rather large one.
462000	465000	I wonder who's how it is.
466000	470000	I don't know, but I know papa would like it.
475000	477000	Hmm, it's much too big.
481000	484000	Oh dear, what's that?
484000	487000	I can really get inside it.
489000	492000	You see, I cover it for my old one.
496000	498000	Oh, I can't moment it.
498000	500000	Stop, moment.
505000	509000	No, that's enough nonsense as it can't take it off now.
509000	511000	Oh, damn.
511000	512000	What's the matter?
512000	515000	I can't move it. It's stuck, moment.
518000	520000	I'll give you a hand.
520000	522000	It's harder.
527000	528000	Oh, that's better.
528000	529000	Thank you.
529000	531000	What's all this noise?
531000	533000	Papa's head got stuck in the hat, Mama.
533000	535000	Oh, yes, and where did that come from?
535000	536000	Oh, moment, Mama.
536000	540000	The children found it when they were out and brought it back for me.
540000	542000	It's very smart.
543000	545000	What shall we do with it, Papa?
545000	547000	There is something strange about it.
547000	549000	Shall I throw it away then?
549000	552000	Oh, no. It's too good for that.
552000	554000	Do we know anyone with a very big head?
554000	556000	No, moment, Papa.
557000	560000	I know what we can do with it.
561000	563000	It's a...
563000	565000	A waste paper basket, Mooma Mama.
565000	566000	That's right.
566000	568000	Well done, Snuffkin.
568000	569000	That was easy.
569000	571000	Come on, Snuffkin.
571000	574000	Come and have some breakfast with us.
574000	577000	Hmm, beautiful.
605000	607000	Yes.
607000	610000	Sorry to disturb you, but I'm going to see Moomin.
610000	611000	Uh-huh.
611000	613000	Do you want to come with me, Snork?
613000	614000	Uh-huh.
614000	616000	Or would you rather stay here?
616000	617000	Uh-huh.
617000	619000	Well, are you coming or not?
619000	620000	Uh-huh.
620000	621000	Not coming, man?
621000	622000	Uh-huh.
622000	623000	Snork?
623000	627000	Well, you know my flying ship is almost finished.
627000	628000	It'll be ready this year.
628000	629000	You'll see.
629000	631000	This is an historic moment.
632000	634000	Oh, dear.
634000	637000	Perhaps it needs a little more work.
640000	643000	I wonder if you really can make a flying ship.
643000	646000	Don't be silly, of course you can't.
646000	649000	A little, my Snorks always dreamed about doing it.
649000	652000	Dreams were all right.
652000	655000	Yes, as long as they're not impossible.
655000	657000	I don't know.
658000	661000	Yes, as long as they're not impossible.
661000	663000	I suppose so.
666000	668000	Hmm.
668000	670000	Sniff, you're not still feeding your face, are you?
670000	672000	Do you ever dream, Sniff?
672000	676000	Only nightmares about having no food at all, little my.
683000	684000	Hmm.
684000	686000	I wonder who dropped this.
686000	688000	Where can I put it?
688000	691000	Oh, there you are.
691000	693000	Just a thing.
717000	719000	Wow.
719000	721000	Golly, what are they?
721000	722000	They're clouds.
722000	723000	Be careful.
723000	724000	Don't touch it.
724000	725000	It might be poisonous.
725000	727000	It feels like cotton.
727000	728000	Well, ee.
728000	729000	This is great.
729000	730000	I'm floating.
730000	731000	Wonderful.
731000	732000	Oh.
733000	734000	Can I try it?
734000	735000	Yes.
735000	736000	Wow.
736000	737000	Golly, what are they?
737000	738000	They're clouds.
738000	739000	Be careful.
739000	740000	Don't touch it.
740000	741000	It might be poisonous.
741000	743000	It feels like cotton.
743000	744000	Well, ee.
744000	745000	This is great.
745000	747000	Can I try it?
747000	750000	Are you ready, Snork Maiden?
750000	751000	Here we go.
751000	752000	Yeah.
762000	764000	What have you got to hide?
764000	765000	My phone.
767000	769000	Wait for me.
769000	770000	Hey.
770000	771000	There's a wait for me.
771000	772000	Whoa.
772000	774000	Whoa.
774000	775000	Whoa.
775000	777000	Hey, wait for me.
777000	778000	Let me get on.
778000	779000	Whoa.
779000	780000	Whoa.
780000	781000	Help!
781000	783000	I'm falling.
789000	794000	Mumen Papa is in his study trying to write his memoirs.
794000	797000	A lot has happened to him over the years.
797000	799000	An awful lot.
799000	802000	And he's trying to remember it.
808000	812000	What was that?
812000	813000	Mumen.
813000	814000	Hi, Papa.
814000	816000	What are you doing out there?
816000	817000	We're flying.
817000	820000	The clouds just came out of the house.
820000	823000	Try and get mirrors so I can reach you.
823000	824000	Oh.
824000	826000	No, I'm alright.
826000	828000	Why don't you come for a ride?
828000	829000	Stop.
829000	830000	Wait a minute.
830000	831000	It's great.
831000	832000	You feel like a bird.
832000	833000	Mumen.
833000	834000	Oh.
834000	835000	Come on, Papa.
835000	836000	Jump or you'll fall.
836000	837000	I hate it.
837000	838000	It's alright.
838000	839000	Oh.
839000	840000	Whoa.
845000	847000	Mumen Mama quickly.
847000	848000	What's the matter?
848000	850000	Have you seen what the children are doing?
850000	851000	Yes.
851000	852000	Look at them.
852000	854000	They're flying about on clouds.
854000	855000	It can't be safe.
855000	857000	Don't worry, Papa.
857000	858000	It's alright.
858000	861000	I told them to be careful.
861000	864000	Come on, Snappy.
864000	866000	Come on.
866000	869000	I won.
869000	870000	I won.
870000	871000	I won.
871000	872000	Whoa.
872000	873000	Hey, wait a minute.
873000	874000	Little cloud.
874000	875000	Wait for me.
875000	876000	Don't go away.
876000	877000	Oh.
877000	878000	Oh, I got you.
878000	879000	That is three cotton.
879000	881000	I'm going to climb right up here.
881000	883000	And I'm going to get you right there.
883000	884000	Come on.
884000	885000	Come on, little cloud.
885000	886000	I'm going to take you with me.
886000	887000	Hey, come on.
887000	888000	You just keep coming back.
888000	889000	Yeah.
889000	890000	I'm going to take you.
890000	891000	Yeah.
891000	892000	I got you now.
892000	893000	You are going to get away from me.
893000	894000	Here I go.
894000	895000	Come on.
895000	896000	All of that ledge.
896000	897000	Come on.
897000	898000	I want you to play.
898000	899000	Oh.
899000	900000	Oh.
900000	901000	Oh.
901000	902000	Oh.
902000	903000	Oh.
903000	904000	Oh.
904000	905000	Oh.
905000	906000	Oh, boy.
906000	907000	What's happening?
907000	909000	My cloud's starting to go.
909000	910000	Oh.
910000	911000	Whoa.
911000	912000	That was fun.
912000	915000	Yeah, it was, but I wasn't ready to stop.
915000	916000	Look.
916000	917000	There's movement in snorkemaiden.
917000	918000	Hey.
918000	919000	Hey.
919000	922000	Why have they still got cloud snuffed in?
922000	924000	There's a starting to go as well.
924000	926000	I think they'd better get off.
926000	927000	Hey.
938000	939000	Right.
939000	940000	I'll start counting.
940000	946000	One, two, three.
946000	949000	Do you want something little mind?
949000	950000	Yes.
950000	951000	A place to hide.
951000	961000	Five, six, seven.
961000	964000	Boy, I don't think there's any place to hide.
964000	965000	And here is there.
965000	967000	No.
967000	968000	Oh.
968000	970000	It's too dirty in there.
970000	971000	I know.
971000	973000	I'll hide in the head.
973000	974000	Ooh.
974000	975000	Ooh.
975000	976000	Ooh.
976000	977000	Ooh.
977000	981000	One, two, one, two, one.
981000	982000	Hey.
982000	983000	Huh?
983000	984000	Huh?
984000	985000	Huh?
985000	986000	Huh?

989000	990000	Huh?
990000	991000	Huh?
991000	992000	Huh?
992000	993000	Huh?
993000	994000	Huh?
994000	995000	Huh?
995000	996000	Huh?
996000	997000	Huh?
997000	998000	Huh?
998000	999000	Huh?
999000	1000000	Huh?
1000000	1001000	Huh?

1009000	1011000	Huh?
1011000	1012000	Huh?
1012000	1013000	Uh-huh.
1013000	1014000	Gotcha.
1014000	1016000	Huh?
1018000	1019000	Huh?
1019000	1021000	Huh?
1021000	1023000	Slork made.
1023000	1050480	Well, last time I saw him, he was hiding in the fireplace.
1050480	1052280	Have you found him yet?
1052280	1053880	Have you looked in the cellar?
1053880	1055080	Yes, I have.
1055080	1059720	Wait a minute, did you hear someone laughing?
1059720	1061560	Where'd it come from?
1061560	1063760	G.I. better go home.
1063760	1065760	Oh, is there anything wrong?
1065760	1068800	Yes, I can't find moment anywhere.
1068800	1071200	Well, he's too fat to be most places.
1071200	1078200	To come in from under the hat.
1078200	1085040	Well, here I am, sniff.
1085040	1088240	Oh, on earth are you.
1088240	1091480	I one land didn't I.
1091480	1095080	You looked everywhere in the house, and you couldn't find me, couldn't you?
1095080	1096080	So I won.
1096080	1098280	Who would want to find you anyway?
1098920	1101720	Well, you were trying hard enough, weren't you?
1101720	1103920	What is this in your game?
1103920	1105920	My name's Snork Maiden.
1105920	1107200	What's yours?
1107200	1111200	I'm the King of Moomin Valley, my pretty one.
1111200	1114160	You're too ugly to be the King of anything.
1114160	1118120	Well, now, that's not a very nice thing to say to your friend.
1118120	1119320	Is it Papa?
1119320	1123080	Now, you'd better tell me what you have done with Moomin.
1123080	1124360	But I'm here.
1124360	1125560	Where?
1125560	1126640	Right here.
1126640	1134040	Who are you, and where is Moomin?
1134040	1135040	Papa.
1135040	1137080	I'm certainly not your Papa.
1137080	1138080	Yes, you are.
1138080	1138760	Come on.
1138760	1139720	I'm Moomin.
1139720	1143120	I don't know who you are, but you're not Moomin.
1143120	1145880	He's nice and handsome and nothing like you.
1145880	1150160	Have you looked at yourself in a mirror?
1150160	1151880	But where's my nose gone?
1151880	1154720	Oh, there's nothing there anymore.
1154760	1157920	Oh, no, my tail's all pushy.
1157920	1159080	Oh, no!
1159080	1159920	Oh!
1164320	1167320	Here!
1167320	1169320	This is terrible!
1169320	1170320	Oh!
1175520	1176920	Who are you?
1176920	1178720	What have you done with me?
1178720	1180920	It must be a nightmare!
1180920	1183320	I want to come back.
1183520	1186520	Go away, you're horrible.
1186520	1189840	Dear me, what's all this noise?
1189840	1192520	What's happened?
1192520	1193840	Mama!
1193840	1194680	Mama!
1194680	1196160	Mama!
1196160	1197720	What earth is this?
1197720	1201080	He says he's Moomin, but just look at him.
1201080	1204120	You don't look like I'm Moomin.
1204120	1205680	I am, I am.
1205680	1207600	Please believe me, Mama.
1207600	1209080	I am Moomin.
1209080	1210720	Well, I don't know.
1210720	1212120	I'm sure.
1212120	1214280	Something's happened to me.
1214280	1216080	Why do I look so different?
1216080	1217920	Now then calm down.
1217920	1219480	This won't help at all.
1219480	1221200	We don't need all this noise.
1221200	1225080	If you really are Moomin, then everything will be all right.
1225080	1228200	Just give me a minute or two and I'll know.
1228200	1230480	Mama, call me Moomin, please.
1230480	1232560	I don't know what's happened, but I am me.
1232560	1233960	Honestly, I am.
1233960	1235600	Mama, please believe me.
1235600	1237000	I am Moomin.
1237000	1239320	Let me see.
1239320	1241480	Oh, Mama, you do know it's me.
1241520	1244400	You must, you can't forget your little Moomin,
1244400	1246640	please, Mama, please, Mama.
1246640	1248680	Oh, hush now, hush now.
1257760	1258680	Mama!
1258680	1259680	Shh!
1263280	1267480	Yes, you're my little Moomin, all right.
1267480	1269000	Oh, Mama!
1269320	1270480	Ah!
1270480	1271760	Ah!
1280760	1281760	Oh!
1285960	1287960	A Moomin!
1288960	1289960	Papa?
1289960	1292160	A Moomin, my boy.
1292160	1294160	Where were you hiding?
1294160	1296160	In there.
1296160	1297160	In the hat?
1299440	1302440	Let's hope it's the last we'll see of it.
1304440	1308080	Moomin, Papa, decided that although it was a fine hat,
1308080	1310440	it was too dangerous to keep.
1310440	1314240	So Moomin threw it in the river and it floated away.
1314240	1316240	He wasn't too sure about it, though,
1316240	1319240	because it was a rather special hat.
1321240	1325240	They love the laughter and they love the laughter.
1326240	1333240	They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.
1333240	1341240	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.
1341240	1345240	They're always happy and always at play.
1345240	1352240	The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.
1352240	1362240	They love the laughter and they love the living, the Moomin's.
1362240	1370240	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.
1370240	1374240	They're always happy and always at play.
1374240	1381240	The Moomin's are having fun day after day, the Moomin's.
1381240	1385240	The Moomin's.
1385240	1391240	The Moomin's.
1391240	1401240	The Moomin's.
1401240	1409240	The Moomin's.
1409240	1413240	Here they are for one and all.
1413240	1416240	The Moomin's are about to call.
1416240	1419240	Come on and sit down here with me.
1419240	1421240	They're here for you on your TV.
1421240	1424240	They are the Moomin's.
1424240	1427240	They are the Moomin's.
1427240	1430240	So come with me, give me your hand.
1430240	1433240	I'll take you up to Moomin land.
1433240	1436240	You can fly just like a bird.
1436240	1438240	Sing that song ever.
1438240	1441240	There were the Moomin's.
1441240	1444240	There were the Moomin's.
1444240	1454240	There were the Moomin's.
1454240	1456240	There were the Moomin's.
1456240	1486240	Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

1516240	1520240	Mumin loves to spend as much time as he can with his friend, Snuffkin.
1521240	1522240	Snuffkin?
1524240	1525240	Snuffkin?
1525240	1527240	Where are you?
1527240	1530240	He must have forgotten I was coming and gone off somewhere.
1531240	1533240	How can he enjoy being here on his own?
1533240	1536240	I'd like to be alone now and then you know.
1536240	1538240	Oh, silly. Let's go and explore.
1538240	1541240	Let's leave it till tomorrow, Snark Maiden.
1541240	1543240	But we said we'd go today.
1543240	1545240	Yeah, we did too, Mumin.
1545240	1547240	You are the one that said it, you know.
1547240	1549240	Hmm, you did. I didn't.
1549240	1550240	You did too.
1550240	1552240	Oh, you must come.
1552240	1554240	We're going to collect shells on the beach.
1554240	1556240	Come on. It'll be fun.
1556240	1557240	Oh, no.
1561240	1562240	Hey!
1562240	1563240	It's Snuff.
1563240	1565240	Where are you guys going?
1565240	1568240	Oh, I envy Snuffkin.
1568240	1569240	Oh, why?
1569240	1570240	I just do.
1574240	1576240	I wonder where Snuffkin has gone.
1579240	1583240	I wonder if we'll ever find anything as exciting as the hat.
1583240	1586240	Yeah, it was very special that hat.
1586240	1588240	Did you really throw it in the river?
1588240	1589240	Yeah.
1589240	1590240	I wish you hadn't.
1590240	1592240	It was much too dangerous to keep.
1592240	1595240	Look at the horrible things it did to me.
1595240	1597240	But what about the eggshells it turned into clouds?
1597240	1600240	Yeah, it was good fun flying around.
1600240	1604240	Perhaps I'll find an oyster with a huge pearl inside.
1605240	1606240	Snuffkin.
1627240	1628240	Moment.
1628240	1629240	Moment.
1629240	1630240	Moment.
1630240	1631240	Moment.
1631240	1632240	Wake up.
1632240	1633240	Snork made me tell.
1633240	1634240	What?
1634240	1635240	What's happened?
1635240	1638240	We were playing tag and she fell into an ant lion hole.
1638240	1640240	We've got to get her out quickly.
1640240	1642240	Come on, moving.
1642240	1643240	Nearly there, Snork Maiden.
1643240	1644240	Just a bit further.
1644240	1645240	Help me, Snuff.
1645240	1646240	Give me your hand.
1646240	1647240	Hurry.
1649240	1650240	Look out.
1650240	1652240	It's the ant lion.
1652240	1654240	Look what you're doing to my hole.
1654240	1655240	I'm sorry.
1655240	1657240	I'll be out soon.
1657240	1659240	Stop yelling and kicking like that.
1659240	1661240	You're scaring off my prey.
1664240	1666240	Are you all right, Snork Maiden?
1666240	1668240	I can't reach her.
1668240	1671240	I don't have to have ants for lunch, you know.
1671240	1673240	Don't be a woman, please.
1673240	1675240	You better get in there, Sniff.
1675240	1676240	What?
1676240	1677240	Me?
1677240	1678240	Don't worry.
1678240	1679240	I'll hold on to you.
1679240	1681240	You're the only one tall enough, Sniff.
1681240	1682240	Come on.
1682240	1683240	You look nice and tasty.
1683240	1684240	I'll eat you and Sniff.
1684240	1686240	You look nice and tasty.
1686240	1687240	I'll eat you and Sniff.
1687240	1688240	Good Sniff.
1688240	1689240	Look, hi.
1689240	1690240	Get in there.
1690240	1691240	You're big.
1691240	1693240	Where you from?
1693240	1694400	You thought you called me a bigWhen.
1694400	1695240	Woah!
1695240	1697240	You gotta grab.
1697240	1698240	Scoughter Right now.
1698240	1700240	Snork Me.
1706240	1708240	Thank you.
1708240	1709240	Thank you.
1709240	1710240	Right.
1710240	1711240	Are you ready?
1711240	1712240	Hold tight.
1712240	1714240	Come on, nearly a bit.
1716240	1718240	Ah!
1718240	1720240	Ah!
1720240	1722240	Come on, nearly a bit.
1724240	1726240	Ah!
1726240	1728240	Ah!
1728240	1730240	Ah!
1742240	1744240	Where have you been, self-kin?
1744240	1746240	That's a big, secret movement.
1746240	1748240	I won't tell anyone.
1748240	1750240	All right. It's the magic hat.
1750240	1752240	It's on a sandbank further down the river.
1752240	1754240	Gosh!
1754240	1756240	But something terrible is happening.
1756240	1758240	What? What is it?
1762240	1766240	Oh dear, perhaps we shouldn't have thrown it in the river.
1766240	1768240	It's too late now.
1768240	1770240	Let's go.
1770240	1772240	It's too late now.
1772240	1774240	Let's get there, cooking.
1784240	1788240	There it is. It's caught on a branch in the middle.
1788240	1792240	Where? Oh, Smovkin, I can see it.
1792240	1794240	Look at the water. It's all red.
1794240	1796240	Hmm. Seems to be coming from the hat.
1796240	1798240	I wonder what it is, move.
1798240	1799240	I won't get it.
1799240	1801240	Be careful.
1801240	1803240	Shall I come too?
1803240	1805240	No, you stay there.
1811240	1813240	Have you got it?
1813240	1815240	Uh-huh.
1829240	1831240	Wow! It's raspberry juice.
1831240	1833240	What should we do with the hat?
1833240	1835240	Well, I don't think it's a good idea to leave it lying around.
1835240	1837240	Somebody might crawl into it.
1837240	1841240	But if we put water in it, we can have as much raspberry juice as we can drink.
1841240	1843240	Well, that would be nice.
1843240	1845240	But you know, movement.
1845240	1847240	It could only be river water that does that.
1847240	1849240	You know what I mean, movement?
1849240	1851240	Well, I think it's worth experimenting.
1851240	1860240	...
1874240	1877240	What's the matter, moving? You look very tired.
1877240	1880240	I woke up in the night and couldn't get back to sleep.
1880240	1882240	Ha, pardon?
1882240	1883240	Couldn't get back to sleep.
1883240	1886240	Ha, what are you talking about?
1886240	1890240	I was awake last night too.
1890240	1892240	And I know why you're so tired.
1892240	1894240	You must have been dreaming.
1894240	1896240	Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in a hurry.
1896240	1899240	Thanks, mama.
1899240	1901240	Where are you going, Moomin?
1901240	1902240	Moomin!
1902240	1904240	Somewhere you can't come.
1904240	1906240	Somewhere private.
1906240	1909240	So, what was that all about, huh?
1909240	1912240	Oh, nothing really important, Moomin, Papa.
1914240	1916240	I think I'll go out.
1924240	1925240	Ha, ha.
1925240	1928240	Nobody hides anything from little, my.
1928240	1930240	Snopkin!
1934240	1935240	Hey, I found out who's had it is.
1935240	1937240	Who's?
1937240	1938240	The Hobgoblins.
1938240	1939240	The Hobgoblins.
1939240	1950240	Yeah, I asked the Hemmielin and he told me that he saw him once, long ago wearing that.
1950240	1953240	I heard about the wizard who flies in the sky.
1953240	1955240	Yeah, on the back of a black panther.
1955240	1959240	The Hobgoblins is hundreds of years old and cares only for rubies.
1959240	1962240	He rides all over the world, searching for them.
1962240	1964240	He's truly awesome.
1967240	1969240	And so, when he dropped his hat?
1969240	1973240	He must have been looking for some rubies right here in Moomin Valley.
1973240	1976240	Do you think he's got a lot of hats, Snopkin?
1976240	1977240	Gee, I don't know.
1977240	1981240	Well, do you think perhaps he doesn't know where he dropped his hat?
1981240	1984240	Yeah, I suppose that's possible.
1984240	1985240	Snopkin!
1985240	1988240	There's something I would like to try with the hat.
1988240	1989240	Just don't put it on.
1989240	1991240	Will you?
1995240	1996240	He's in there somewhere.
1996240	1999240	Hat lions are pretty stupid, you know.
1999240	2004240	Yes, Moomin Papa told me it takes him hours to dig themselves into the sand.
2004240	2005240	Oh, no, it doesn't.
2005240	2006240	It only takes him one hour.
2006240	2007240	Only an hour?
2007240	2008240	You're kidding.
2008240	2012240	Well, of course, an hour is a long time to spend, digging.
2012240	2015240	Are you talking about me?
2015240	2019240	Yes, about how quickly you could dig yourself into a hole in the sand.
2019240	2022240	A lot quicker than you think it'll take.
2022240	2026240	Moomin here says it takes you only one hour to dig a hole in the sand.
2026240	2028240	But I can't believe that.
2029240	2033240	Snopkin says it takes several hours, but I think he's wrong.
2033240	2034240	I'll show you how long.
2036240	2038240	Gosh, that was rather fast.
2039240	2043240	Yeah, but it's obvious he's already got a ready-made hole hidden there.
2043240	2044240	Don't you ant lion.
2046240	2047240	No, I do not.
2049240	2052240	I can dig myself in anywhere, anywhere at all.
2059240	2060240	How about here?
2060240	2061240	Yeah, okay.
2061240	2062240	Under this rock.
2062240	2063240	All right?
2063240	2064240	Anywhere.
2064240	2065240	Just show me.
2065240	2067240	Okay, start from here.
2068240	2070240	Yeah, just there if you don't mind.
2070240	2072240	All right, start counting.
2077240	2080240	Wow, you only took a second and a half.
2080240	2082240	He's really something, isn't he?
2082240	2083240	He certainly is.
2083240	2085240	I'd better sit on it.
2085240	2087240	Yeah, he'll be a really mad.
2099240	2101240	So you've caught the ant lion.
2101240	2102240	I've been watching.
2102240	2103240	Little boy.
2103240	2104240	Right.
2104240	2106240	Did you follow us last night?
2106240	2107240	Yes.
2107240	2109240	Oh, did you tell the others?
2109240	2111240	Oh, don't be silly you guys.
2111240	2112240	I haven't said a word yet.
2112240	2115240	But you will if we don't let you join in with us.
2115240	2117240	That's what she's doing, movement.
2117240	2119240	No, as if I do such a thing.
2119240	2122240	Of course, I'm forgetting how nice and kind you are.
2124240	2125240	Hey.
2126240	2128240	Hey, what is that?
2137240	2139240	Nope, no hat anywhere.
2145240	2147240	There's gallons of water.
2147240	2150240	Gosh, there sure must be a lot of sand in there.
2150240	2154240	He must have changed into something else by now.
2154240	2155240	Probably.
2155240	2157240	It must have been long enough.
2157240	2158240	Oh, jump off.
2161240	2164240	He isn't strong enough to move the rock by himself.
2165240	2166240	Shall we help him?
2166240	2167240	No, don't.
2167240	2169240	Come on, let's do it.
2173240	2175240	What's happened to him?
2175240	2177240	Let's turn it over.
2177240	2179240	Oh, no, I can't look.
2184240	2186240	I'll give it a try.
2189240	2190240	Oh.
2200240	2201240	It's a hedgehog.
2205240	2207240	It's a sword.

3591240	3610240	it's going over hang on everybody I've lost my confidence and it makes me feel very
3610240	3617240	unhappy well it can happen to anyone you know even to you well not much of course
3617240	3623240	lucky you I just don't know what to do how can I get it back there must be a way
3623240	3634240	it's hard to say everybody's different but with me it just happens I don't think
3634240	3641240	I'll ever invent anything again perhaps I'll have a break from my memoirs too
3641240	3644800	tea time oh dear what's the matter with you too you look a bit down in the
3644800	3654240	dance you know I might have been a bit overconfident me too I think
3654240	3663240	there's no need to yell we can hear you watch the matter sniff
3663240	3670240	we found a boat on the beach come and have a look a shipwreck washed up on the shore
3670240	3677240	it's not a wreck and it's got a white sail we're going to repair it and then it'll be ours
3677240	3682240	all right I'm coming come on snork let's take a look at this boat it could be
3682240	3687240	just the thing the chair is both up so it's got a sail a white sail you say
3687240	3696240	that could be extremely interesting it's a sturdy little craft is nicely built well
3696240	3706240	designed she's abandoned so does that we can keep her
3706240	3711240	it seems to be in pretty good condition except for the hole in the bottom you
3711240	3716240	know maybe that's why she was abandoned here you could be right softkin finders
3716240	3721240	keepers you guys of course it makes it our boat you'd have to wait to see if anyone
3721240	3726240	claims it first little mine what shall we do then papa well first things first
3726240	3733240	we must repair the hole and then tire up securely in case there's a storm absolutely
3733240	3740240	then if the owner comes we ought to give her back to him mind you she might know
3740240	3747240	she's here so what are we going to do when we've repaired her it's bad for boats not
3747240	3758240	to be yours we could sail the seven seas I'd be happy just to explore around here
3758240	3763240	don't worry snork maiden if we get big waves we can sail between them isn't that right
3763240	3772240	moment papa well in a way come on let's get to work how about you snork will you help us

3784240	3791240	get her out of the water first shall we and we'll need some big logs to go under
3791240	3801240	I think ten should be enough I'll be safe to work on so we'll want something strong
3801240	3808240	to keep her upright as well and lots of tools I'll go home and get some and I think we'll
3808240	3815240	need a bucket and a shovel I'll come with you help you choose yes you go I'll stay

4281240	4286840	Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.
4299160	4304760	It was a lovely day, and Mumen, his family and friends decided to go for a trip in the
4304760	4309560	boat they'd found washed up on the beach. They didn't know where they were going, and thought
4309560	4311320	it would be much more fun that way.
4313240	4315720	Momma, we're not going away forever, you know.
4315720	4316920	I hope not.
4316920	4319320	I don't think we'll need all these pots and pans.
4319320	4321480	It's best to be prepared at sea.
4321480	4322360	What do you mean?
4323080	4325800	Well, you'll only complain if you don't get a hot meal.
4325800	4327080	I never complain.
4327080	4331080	And you know how hungry the sea air made you all last time we went out on a boat.
4331080	4332520	You'd have been glad of food then.
4333480	4336040	You got to rough it a bit if you want an adventure.
4336040	4338760	Yes, but it will be more fun with coffee and pancakes.
4340440	4343880	Aren't you too ready yet?
4353800	4355080	Hello, Mumen!
4356040	4357320	Hi, snorkebagel!
4357560	4358760	Whoa!
4368760	4370200	Must you use that ladder?
4370920	4371960	I'm all right.
4371960	4374520	Mumen, you're going to hurt yourself one of these days.
4374520	4375560	It's good practice.
4375560	4376760	It's not coming with us.
4377480	4381000	He says he hasn't got time for sailing boats at the moment.
4382920	4386760	I'd much rather a real sailing boat than a paper flying ship any day.
4387960	4389640	Our mama and papa are ready yet?
4389640	4391640	They're packing a path the kitchen.
4391640	4393640	Oh, it's too full.
4396120	4397880	Have we got to take all that with us?
4397880	4401640	Our mama thinks it's better to be safe than sorry and she's usually right.
4401640	4404840	Tell me, Mumen, where exactly are we going?
4404840	4406360	We haven't decided yet.
4406360	4407320	That's right.
4407320	4408360	Wait and see.
4417320	4442760	Mr. Hamulin, have you found a rare plan for your collection yet?
4442760	4444360	Unfortunately not.
4444360	4446840	There are lots of these in Mumen Valley already.
4446840	4449400	Goodness, where are you taking all that?
4449400	4451080	We're going sailing.
4451080	4454360	How exciting, charting new seas and exploring desert islands.
4454360	4455800	Never know.
4455800	4466040	If I help you load up the boat, can I please come with you?
4466040	4483560	Captain of Ridge, down the yard arm, hankers away, sailors beware, splice the manbrace,
4483560	4487880	all hands on deck, full speed ahead.
4487880	4490280	Hey, Sniff, any sun of the movements?
4490280	4491080	Not yet.
4491080	4493240	It's a great day to go sailing.
4493240	4495080	I wonder where we're going.
4495160	4496840	I don't have any idea.
4496840	4499160	I don't actually like sailing much.
4500200	4501160	Do you get sick?
4501160	4502520	Well, not really sick.
4502520	4504440	It's just that I can't swim.
4504440	4507480	And if it's rough, it frightens me and I panic a bit.
4509160	4511240	It looks like it's going to stay calm.
4511240	4512120	So don't worry.
4516280	4518440	Right, that's the lot.
4518520	4520280	Now, all aboard.
4520280	4524040	Mama, little Mai, Stafkin, Moomin,
4524040	4527800	Snork Maiden, and Mr. Hambylin' of course.
4527800	4529320	Isn't he a bit old for adventures?
4529320	4530040	Not at all.
4530040	4534360	No, Moomin' Papa has promised to find a deserted island where I shall search for rare plants.
4534360	4539480	Don't you want to go?
4539480	4541320	Do you want to go?
4541320	4541960	No, move it, you.
4546760	4548280	Come on, Sniff, hurry up.
4549560	4550440	There's no rum.
4551000	4552200	Don't be silly, Sniff.
4552200	4552840	Of course there is.
4555240	4558200	It looks very full, almost thinking.
4558200	4560600	There's no way this boat could sink.
4560600	4561880	Now, come on, get him.
4562280	4562680	Oh.
4564360	4566360	Really?
4566360	4568360	I promise it'll be all right.
4568360	4569360	Won't it, Papa?
4569360	4572360	Well, if it stays like this, it will.
4572360	4574360	Moment.
4574360	4576360	I'll come next time.
4576360	4577360	Let's go, moment, Papa.
4577360	4579360	He's just a scary cat.
4579360	4581360	Hmm.
4581360	4583360	We'll go without you then, Snape.
4583360	4584360	Hmm.
4584360	4585360	I think that will be best.
4585360	4588360	Anyway, someone had better stay and look after moment house
4588360	4590360	and it might just as well be me.
4590360	4592360	That's very thoughtful of you.
4592360	4594360	There's a pancake on the kitchen table
4594360	4595360	that you can have for lunch.
4595360	4596360	Thank you, Mama.
4596360	4598360	Have a nice trip.
4604360	4606360	I wish Sniff had come.
4606360	4608360	He's a big softie.
4608360	4611360	Well, he's not very good at swimming
4611360	4613360	and he does eat rather a lot.
4622360	4625360	This is the life, isn't it, Mama?
4625360	4627360	It certainly is, dear.
4628360	4630360	This is the life, isn't it, Mama?
4630360	4632360	It certainly is, dear.
4650360	4654360	Oh, look, not a breath of wind.
4654360	4656360	Shall I start rowing, Papa?
4656360	4659360	Yes, you'd better get Sniffkin to help you.
4659360	4661360	Aye-aye, Captain.
4664360	4665360	It's hardly moving.
4665360	4667360	You'll have to do better than that.
4667360	4669360	We're doing our best.
4670360	4672360	You two would be useless as galley slaves.
4672360	4675360	It's good that we're not then, isn't it?
4675360	4677360	So then, what's your excuse?
4677360	4679360	It's not easy rowing against the tide.
4679360	4680360	You try it.
4680360	4683360	No, dear, at this rate, I should be lucky
4683360	4685360	to find one rare plant.
4685360	4687360	Well, Mr. Hamlin, you could always try
4687360	4689360	collecting some seaweed instead.
4689360	4691360	There's plenty of that.
4691360	4693360	I have heard tales that if you whistle,
4693360	4696360	those who perished at sea will send you a wind.
4697360	4699360	Land! Ahoy!
4699360	4701360	Look, Moomin, Papa!
4703360	4706360	That's too small to be any good.
4710360	4711360	You're right.
4716360	4718360	Hey, look, Papa! We're moving again!
4718360	4720360	The tide's turned and the wind's up.
4724360	4726360	What a beautiful island!
4726360	4728360	And a perfect place to land, too.
4728360	4732360	Oh, I bet this place has got some rare plants.
4732360	4734360	Be careful when you explore.
4734360	4736360	There could be wild animals there.
4736360	4738360	Now it's time to go.
4738360	4740360	Let's go.
4741360	4743360	I'll be careful when you explore.
4743360	4745360	There could be wild animals there.
4745360	4747360	Now if someone will go and collect some wood,
4747360	4749360	I'll get a fire started.
4749360	4753360	I bet none of you will say no to coffee and pancakes.
4753360	4755360	Watch me, you land lovers.
4755360	4757360	I'll go and pull the boat ashore.
4771360	4773360	I suppose you're right.
4773360	4775360	As I said, Papa, it's always better to rough it
4775360	4777360	with a little bit of luxury.
4777360	4780360	I wonder if we're the first to set foot on the island.
4783360	4785360	Thank you, children.
4785360	4787360	Is there anything else you want us to do?
4787360	4789360	No, I don't think so.
4789360	4791360	Is it okay if I go explore the island?
4791360	4793360	Of course, off you go.
4793360	4795360	Coming, Snork, may done.
4795360	4797360	I'll stay and help Moomin Mama with the cooking.
4798360	4800360	Mama, you said we needed firewood.
4800360	4801360	Is this enough?
4801360	4803360	My goodness for a lot.
4807360	4810360	You know, I don't think anyone lives on this island.
4810360	4814360	I haven't seen anyone unless they're hiding in the bushes.
4814360	4816360	I've seen someone.
4816360	4817360	Oh yeah?
4817360	4818360	Who?
4818360	4819360	Well, they weren't very big.
4819360	4821360	What do you mean, this big?
4821360	4823360	Well, same as me.
4823360	4824360	What did they look like?
4824360	4826360	Sort of white and ghostly and not very friendly looking either.
4826360	4829360	Well, you probably just thought you saw something a little mic.
4829360	4832360	I did see them. I did too.
4832360	4833360	Keep your hair on.
4833360	4835360	I'm not saying you didn't see anything.
4838360	4841360	Goodness, this is magnificent.
4841360	4844360	Oh, what a find.
4844360	4848360	And what's this?
4848360	4850360	I don't know.
4851360	4854360	Oh, I don't know anything.
4854360	4856360	What's this?
4864360	4867360	What's this?
4870360	4875360	Oh, well, well, well.
4875360	4878360	I've never seen such rare and beautiful mountains.
4878360	4882360	It's never seen such rare and beautiful plants.
4898360	4901360	Well, what's this? Goodness, it's a perimeter.
4901360	4905360	Now, let's see. Rain and storm. Probably broken.
4908360	4922360	Oh, hello. Who are you? Oh, I see. This is your perimeter, isn't it? Now watch it. Mind you don't travel on those flowers, will you?
4925360	4931360	Oh, no, no, no. They're coming to get me. Don't go away. Don't go away.
4932360	4943360	I think what little my saw was a hatty fattener. They're not ghosts, are they snuffkin? No, they look kind of like it, but they're really harmless enough movement.
4946360	4950360	Oh, dear, what on earth was that? It sounded like Mr. Hamulin.
4961360	4990360	That's it, that's what I saw. It's Mr. Hamulin. Help, get me down.
4991360	5000360	Why are they after you, Mr. Hamulin? What'd you do to them? I don't know. I just tapped on this post and asked them to be careful with the flowers.
5000360	5006360	They seem a bit angry to me. Well, then I tapped the marrometer to check the weather, and they came at me.
5006360	5011360	Well, I don't think it's a flower somat about. Maybe they thought you were trying to steal the marrometer.
5011360	5018360	I don't want it to keep it. My goodness, I'm collecting flowers, not marrometers. Well, hang on.
5018360	5026360	I can't hang on much longer, hurry, please. They don't look so easily frightened. No, now let me think.
5026360	5030360	Hurry, I'm slipping.
5030360	5038360	I've got it, Mr. Hamulin. The hatty fattener can't see or hear very well, but they are very sensitive. We'll have to try and frighten them.
5038360	5047360	I suggest you shake the post as hard as you can. Harder, harder, Mr. Hamulin.
5049360	5054360	Look, they can feel the ground moving. Keep going, Mr. Hamulin.
5056360	5060360	I'm getting very tired. I've been touched if I can't.
5060360	5065360	They're not going, it's no fun. Are you sure this will work?
5078360	5082360	You can stop now, Mr. Hemmilan.
5082360	5084360	Mr. Hemmilan!
5084360	5087360	Oh dear!
5087360	5091360	Hey, are you all right, Mr. Hemmilan?
5091360	5094360	What disgusting creatures!
5094360	5097360	I have a good mind to take their precious barometer.
5097360	5099360	I don't think that's such a good idea.
5099360	5102360	It's no good anyway, it's not working.
5102360	5105360	How do you know that, Mr. Hemmilan?
5106360	5108360	Look, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?
5108360	5112360	But according to this barometer, it should be pouring down with rain.
5115360	5118360	This is the way to explore real home cooking.
5118360	5120360	It just takes a little thought.
5120360	5124360	And woman papa is always prepared, aren't you dear?
5124360	5128360	Double zero, it can't get any lower than that.
5128360	5129360	What does that mean?
5129360	5133360	If it was working, it would mean being for a terrible storm.
5134360	5139360	I think the reading might be right after all, Mr. Hemmilan.
5139360	5143360	See the way the sky is darkening.
5148360	5150360	Look at those storm clouds.
5150360	5152360	We better go before it's too late.
5152360	5154360	But there won't be time to get home.
5154360	5156360	We'll be shipwrecked, woman papa.
5156360	5158360	Surely there's still time.
5158360	5161360	We don't want to go back to moving valley yet.
5161360	5163360	We've only explored half the island.
5163360	5167360	Besides, you never know what we might find, Snort Maiden.
5167360	5170360	I wanted to get my hands on those happy fat nurse.
5170360	5173360	That's the last thing I wanted to do, little mind, the very last.
5173360	5175360	I think we ought to leave now.
5175360	5177360	What do you think, mama?
5177360	5180360	Well, you're the captain, dear. It's up to you.
5180360	5182360	So I am. Now, let me think.
5192360	5193360	Oh.
5207360	5209360	Right, we'll stay.
5209360	5210360	Oh, can we?
5210360	5213360	Yes, but we must put the tent up before it starts raining.
5213360	5214360	What tent?
5214360	5218360	Always be prepared. That's my motto.
5218360	5221360	You're very clever to think of everything.
5221360	5225360	First, we must lower the sails and pull the boat up
5225360	5228360	so that she's out of harm's way.
5243360	5245360	That should do it.
5246360	5250360	Well done, everybody. It should be safe here.
5250360	5254360	Now hurry with the tent, the storm's nearly here.
5256360	5258360	Are you all right, Mr. Himulan?
5258360	5260360	You stay here and rest.
5260360	5262360	We'll manage without you.
5262360	5264360	I am a bit tired.
5264360	5270360	You get your breath back first, but don't forget to tie the boat to that tree before you come up.
5270360	5273360	It looks bad. A real humdinger.
5273360	5275360	You can trust me.
5277360	5279360	Right, let's get that tent up.
5280360	5282360	Oh, dear, what a day.
5296360	5298360	Oh, what's this here?
5303360	5306360	Oh, yes.
5306360	5310360	Well, fans, see that I've never seen one of these before.
5316360	5318360	Snuffkin?
5320360	5321360	What's happening?
5321360	5326360	It's coming really fast. Look at the rain over the sea.
5326360	5328360	We're going to get soaked if we stay here.
5328360	5330360	Just a minute.
5330360	5332360	But we'll get wet.
5332360	5335360	I know, but it's so exciting.
5335360	5337360	Things which you have no control over.
5337360	5340360	You can see this great big storm coming towards you.
5340360	5343360	And you can't do anything about it.
5343360	5345360	No.
5345360	5348360	You have to time it just right.
5348360	5352360	When to make a run for shelter, you mean?
5352360	5355360	I knew you'd understand.
5358360	5361360	I wonder what the Hattie Fatterners are doing.
5361360	5363360	Waiting for the thunderstorm.
5363360	5364360	Why?
5364360	5367360	Because they get energy from the electricity and the lightning.
5367360	5369360	Really?
5369360	5372360	That's it. Come on.
5372360	5375360	I've never seen rain like this.
5375360	5378360	It'll be over soon enough, Momen.
5378360	5381360	You're dressed, Mom.
5381360	5383360	I know.
5383360	5385360	It's all right.
5385360	5387360	I'll look for you.
5387360	5389360	I know.
5389360	5390360	It's all right.
5390360	5392360	I'll look for you.
5392360	5394360	I'll look for you.
5394360	5396360	I'll look for you.
5396360	5398360	I'll look for you.
5398360	5400360	I'll look for you.
5400360	5401360	I'll look for you.
5401360	5402360	All right.
5402360	5404360	I'll look after you.
5431360	5459360	That was a close one.
5459360	5460360	Too close.
5460360	5461660	Too close.
5461660	5464160	I think it's over, Snork Maiden.
5466260	5468760	What a find I made today!
5468760	5497760	If, like the movements and their friends, you're stranded on the desert island in a huge storm, all you can do is wait until it's blown itself out.
5498760	5503760	But what if the waves are so high that your boat is caught up and washed out to sea?
5503760	5506760	That is a different story altogether.
5527760	5541760	The movements, believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements, they're always happy and always at play.
5541760	5552760	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements, the movements.
5552760	5570760	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements, believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements, they're always happy and always at play.
5570760	5587760	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements, the movements, the movements.
5600760	5630760	The movements are having fun day after day, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the
5630760	5655380	movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements, the movements
5660760	5690760	Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
5690760	5712440	bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba I think that Royal
5712440	5713780	He's getting loose.
5713780	5715840	OK, Moonman, you'd better have a look
5715840	5718160	before this wind has the whole tent down.
5718160	5718960	The eye, Captain.
5721760	5724640	A sudden storm has hit the hafifat in his island.
5730840	5733400	Moonman Papa has decided that it would be far safer
5733400	5735520	to stay the night on the island,
5735520	5737840	so they put up the tent and moored the boat.
5742840	5744840	This will show us what the weather's up to.
5744840	5746840	That's as long as it's still working.
5746840	5749840	I'm sure it's going to die down really soon.
5749840	5751840	Oh, wake up, Mr. Hemelon.
5751840	5754640	When the storm clears, we must give this barometer
5754640	5756640	straight back to the hafifat in his.
5756640	5761640	Oh, I quite fancy keeping it myself to remind me of the island.
5761640	5764640	You know, it seems to work after all.
5764640	5768640	But Mr. Hemelon, that'll only work for you.
5769640	5771640	What about all the tons of plants you found?
5771640	5773640	That surely is going to be enough.
5773640	5777640	Yes, I know, but there was only really one special flower
5777640	5780640	amongst all those plants, and I nearly missed that one.
5780640	5782640	Look, isn't it a beauty?
5782640	5785640	I discovered it as I was about to tie up the boat.
5785640	5788640	Oh, woman, Papa.
5788640	5790640	Yes, Mr. Hemelon.
5790640	5793640	You know, when you all went to put up the tent,
5793640	5796640	you told me that I was about to tie up the boat.
5797640	5799640	So she was safe.
5799640	5801640	Yes, of course.
5801640	5803640	Well, I'm not sure if I did.
5803640	5805640	Not sure at all.
5805640	5809640	Please, try to remember, Mr. Hemelon.
5809640	5810640	I can't.
5810640	5813640	It's all very unpear in my mind.
5813640	5817640	If the boat's not here, we'll be stuck on the island forever and ever.
5817640	5821640	Oh, we pulled it well ashore, so it should be okay.
5821640	5824640	But we'd better check on it as soon as we can.
5824640	5826640	I'll go have a look.
5826640	5827640	Quickly, moment.
5827640	5829640	Be careful.
5829640	5830640	I remember.
5830640	5833640	I was just going to do it when I spotted this flower.
5833640	5835640	Just by a rocket was...
5835640	5836640	Oh, dear.
5838640	5839640	Woman.
5840640	5842640	Woman.
5856640	5858640	Boy, that was close.
5858640	5862640	Tie it to the tree and make sure it's tight.
5863640	5865640	That should do it.
5865640	5867640	Just in time.
5867640	5870640	You know the waves must have been huge to reach this far.
5870640	5872640	Well, we saved the boat.
5872640	5873640	Yes.
5875640	5878640	Well, this storm will be over soon.
5884640	5886640	Is everything okay?
5886640	5888640	Yep, everything's fine.
5888640	5890640	Oh, thank goodness.
5890640	5892640	So we're not stranded after all.
5892640	5894640	Huh? No.
5894640	5896640	We needn't have worried.
5896640	5898640	I'm very sorry.
5898640	5900640	Really, I am.
5900640	5903640	Are you alright, Snort Maiden?
5903640	5905640	Now I am.
5920640	5923640	According to this, the storm is blowing over now
5923640	5925640	and it should stop raining soon.
5925640	5927640	Well, the wind seems to have dropped.
5927640	5931640	Oh, good. All that thunder and lightning is so noisy.
5931640	5933640	Ah, right.
5933640	5938640	I think I'll just go for a bit of a walk before I settle down for the night.
5938640	5941640	But it's much too dark to see anything.
5941640	5944640	The fresh air will do me good.
5946640	5948640	That's a good idea.
5948640	5951640	I could do with some fresh air myself.
5951640	5953640	Wait for me. I'll come too.
5953640	5955640	Let me in quicker than mine.
5955640	5959640	There's still there hundreds of them all glowing.
5959640	5961640	The hatty fat nurse.
5961640	5963640	They're waiting for us.
5971640	5974640	The lightning must have recharged them.
5974640	5976640	Look at them all.
5976640	5979640	I wonder what they want, Snort Maiden.
5980640	5984640	Such a heavy storm would have given them lots and lots of energy.
5984640	5986640	Gosh, they're ready for anything.
5986640	5989640	They're not coming any closer.
5989640	5991640	They seem fairly friendly.
5991640	5993640	Maybe they just want to see what we look like.
5993640	5995640	No, I know what they're here for.
5995640	5997640	Oh, what's that, Snuffkin?
5997640	5999640	It's their barometer, Moomin Papa.
5999640	6003640	They know we've got it and they've come to get it back from us.
6003640	6006640	Yes, I think you're right, Snuffkin.
6006640	6008640	Mr. Hamilton?
6009640	6012640	I do think you'd better give it back to them.
6012640	6014640	Do I have to?
6014640	6016640	Yes, of course.
6016640	6020640	After all it is there isn't there are a lot of them.
6020640	6024640	Look, why don't you take it out to them now?
6028640	6032640	You know the barometer does belong to the Mr. Hamilton.
6032640	6034640	Oh, dear, dear.
6034640	6036640	Give it to me.
6037640	6039640	Let me do it, Papa.
6039640	6041640	Well done, my boy.
6043640	6045640	You must be careful, my dear.
6045640	6047640	Don't worry, Mama.
6047640	6049640	A boy isn't he brave.
6067640	6069640	I think this is what you've come for.
6077640	6079640	Here you are.
6079640	6081640	You can have it back now.
6092640	6094640	Moomin!
6097640	6099640	Moomin!
6099640	6102640	Are you all right, Moomin?
6102640	6104640	I'll tell you something.
6104640	6107640	I'm real glad there's no electricity where we live.
6107640	6110640	Oh, they didn't hurt you, did they?
6110640	6112640	Ah! Go away!
6112640	6114640	Leave her alone!
6114640	6117640	Are you all right, Snorkemaiden?
6117640	6119640	What did he do to you?
6119640	6121640	Just a bit.
6122640	6124640	Are you all right, Snorkemaiden?
6124640	6125640	What did he do to you?
6125640	6128640	Just a bit of shock, that's all.
6128640	6131640	What's that funny smell?
6133640	6135640	Oh, my god, it's your hair.
6135640	6136640	What?
6136640	6139640	What do you mean?
6139640	6141640	What's happened to it?
6141640	6142640	Oh, no, my hair.
6142640	6144640	Mama, Mama!
6144640	6145640	Where's your mirror?
6145640	6146640	Oh, Mama.
6146640	6150640	Oh, look at what those wicked, hatty fat nurse have done.
6152640	6154640	It's here in my handbag somewhere.
6154640	6156640	Hurry, Mama!
6156640	6158640	I must see what's happened to my hair.
6158640	6160640	Here you are, dear.
6160640	6162640	Look at me!
6162640	6163640	Look at me!
6163640	6165640	It's awful!
6166640	6168640	It's horrible!
6168640	6170640	Don't worry, we'll put some magic ointment on
6170640	6172640	and it'll come back all lovely and curly.
6172640	6175640	I don't want nasty curly hair.
6175640	6179640	I want my long, beautiful hair like it was before.
6179640	6186640	You know, it really doesn't matter to me, Snort Maiden.
6186640	6196640	Oh, God, oh, God, I hope that's the last we see of them.
6196640	6200640	Oh, dear, what's happened to Snort Maiden?
6200640	6207640	My hair, my hair, where's my hair?
6230640	6234640	My hair, my hair.
6260640	6264640	My hair, my hair.
6291640	6293640	Wake up, woman.
6293640	6295640	We've got to hurry.
6313640	6315640	I wonder where they're going.
6315640	6318640	Perhaps we're saving a way to a secret island.
6318640	6321640	Somewhere very far away from here where they can live happily
6321640	6323640	on their own together.
6326640	6329640	Gosh, Snort Maiden, they're really weird.
6329640	6332640	Well, it depends on how you look at it, woman.
6332640	6335640	They probably think we're a bit strange, too.
6335640	6340640	Snort Maiden, you're a bit strange, too.
6346640	6348640	Snort Maiden, you're really horrible.
6348640	6350640	You knew I wanted to see them.
6350640	6353640	Come on, you were fast asleep.
6353640	6354640	Snoring your head off.
6354640	6357640	That wasn't me snoring that was Mr. Himulin.
6357640	6358640	All right.
6358640	6360640	If you say so.
6360640	6363640	Well, I hope that's the last I'll see of them.
6363640	6364640	Me, too.
6365640	6367640	That's a very pretty scarf, Snort Maiden.
6367640	6369640	Yes, it is, isn't it?
6369640	6372640	Can we go exploring, Mama?
6372640	6374640	I don't see why not.
6374640	6376640	It looks as though it'll be a nice day
6376640	6380640	and there'll be lots of exciting things washed up by the storm.
6380640	6382640	Oh, that'll be fun.
6382640	6384640	Let's look for the other side of the island.
6384640	6385640	What a good idea.
6385640	6388640	I might discover some more plants.
6395640	6397640	Mr. Himulin, hurry up, sir.
6397640	6400640	Or it will be dark before we get there.
6400640	6402640	You go on, Momen.
6402640	6405640	I just want to have a better look at these flowers.
6405640	6408640	Yes, all right.
6408640	6412640	Very interesting.
6412640	6418640	Just think we could find all sorts of things lying on the sand.
6419640	6421640	I hope it's secret, sunken treasure.
6421640	6423640	Well, let's hope it's not sunken anymore.
6423640	6425640	I expect there'll be lots and lots of treasures
6425640	6427640	from shipwrecks and things like that.
6427640	6430640	But I find it before you.
6430640	6432640	Oh, no, you won't.
6445640	6447640	Look at all this.
6447640	6450640	I'm going to dive in.
6450640	6454640	What's that over there?
6454640	6457640	It's quite shallow right here.
6457640	6460640	Well, there must be something admit it.
6460640	6462640	Oh, dear, it's empty.
6462640	6465640	I think I found something here.
6469640	6471640	Little lie, little lie.
6471640	6474640	What's the matter?
6474640	6476640	Come and see these beautiful shelves I have.
6476640	6478640	I'm too busy hunting for treasure
6478640	6481640	to bother with shells.
6489640	6491640	Hey, what's this?
6491640	6494640	What?
6497640	6499640	Oh, look at this one.
6499640	6501640	I've got a real collection here.
6501640	6504640	Got a lovely mama's garden.
6510640	6513640	Wow, watch that.
6513640	6515640	What?
6515640	6518640	I can't find any as nice as yours.
6518640	6521640	Don't be in such an awful hurry, little lie.
6521640	6523640	Shnark maiden!
6523640	6524640	Shnark maiden!
6524640	6525640	Look!
6525640	6527640	Look what I found.
6527640	6529640	A proper treasure.
6529640	6531640	Look!
6531640	6533640	Whoa!
6533640	6536640	There's snow inside of it.
6536640	6539640	I found it in a cave.
6539640	6542640	What is it?
6542640	6544640	What's this?
6544640	6546640	It's a ship telescope.
6546640	6548640	You can see for miles with it.
6548640	6550640	I'll give it to Papa.
6550640	6553640	It's better than anything I got.
6555640	6558640	Hey, everybody, I found something.
6558640	6560640	Come on up and have a look.
6560640	6563640	I wish I could find something interesting.
6567640	6570640	Have you found some buried treasure?
6575640	6577640	What a big lady.
6577640	6578640	Is she dead?
6578640	6580640	It's made of wood, Snork maiden.
6580640	6583640	It's a figurehead from a ship.
6589640	6591640	She's like a queen.
6594640	6595640	Ha!
6595640	6598640	She hasn't got any legs, though.
6599640	6602640	Why don't we put her on the front of our boat?
6602640	6604640	Nah, it's much too heavy.
6604640	6607640	It must have come from a ship that was wrecked.
6607640	6609640	And Sank had seen?
6609640	6612640	Perhaps it did.
6612640	6615640	And all hands were lost.
6615640	6618640	I want to take it home.
6618640	6620640	What would you do with it?
6620640	6623640	Use it or frighten people away.
6627640	6631640	Help! Somebody help me, please!
6631640	6633640	That's old, Mr. Hamilton.
6633640	6636640	Gosh, I hope it's not more haddy fattiners.
6636640	6638640	Someone help, please!
6638640	6640640	We're coming!
6646640	6649640	Woman, why do you like this old figurehead so much?
6649640	6651640	You're staring at her.
6651640	6653640	She's not all that special, you know?
6653640	6655640	Yes, I know.
6655640	6656640	She's not even real.
6656640	6658640	Only made of wood.
6660640	6663640	Do you like her eyes?
6663640	6665640	Or is it her hair?
6665640	6668640	Just because I haven't got any?
6668640	6670640	Nearly there, just a bit further.
6670640	6672640	Come on, snuffed it for you.
6673640	6675640	You're very heavy, Mr. Hamilton.
6675640	6677640	Oh, thank you, Snuffed Kid.
6677640	6679640	You saved my life.
6679640	6681640	Oh!
6681640	6684640	Boy, how'd you end up there, Mr. Hamilton?
6684640	6686640	One minute, I was looking for plants.
6686640	6689640	The next I'd fall and ride into that hole.
6689640	6692640	I think you'd be safe for collecting stamps, Mr. Hamilton.
6692640	6694640	Oh, no, it's not.
6694640	6696640	It's not.
6696640	6698640	It's not.
6698640	6701640	You'd be safe for collecting stamps, Mr. Hamilton.
6701640	6703640	Oh, no, it's not here.
6703640	6705640	Where is it?
6705640	6708640	What is it now?
6708640	6710640	Tell me.
6710640	6712640	Make a move and preserve me.
6712640	6714640	Calm down, Mr. Hamilton.
6714640	6716640	Tell me what's the matter?
6716640	6718640	My sample box, my sample box.
6718640	6720640	Oh, my goodness.
6720640	6723640	You didn't leave it in the hole, did you?
6723640	6725640	Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
6725640	6727640	Oh, dear.
6727640	6728640	Oh, she's samples.
6728640	6729640	I'm so silly.
6729640	6731640	Oh, Snuffed Kid.
6731640	6734640	Oh.
6734640	6736640	Oh, Snuffed Kid, would you mind?
6736640	6737640	Okay.
6737640	6738640	Anything for some peace.
6738640	6741640	Oh, dear boy, you are wonderful.
6741640	6744640	You shall have one of my rarest plants as a reward.
6744640	6745640	Indeed, you shall.
6745640	6747640	I shall choose a magnificent one for you.
6747640	6749640	Thank you very much, Mr. Hamilton.
6749640	6752640	Gosh, your one-word movement is.
6754640	6756640	Oh, there you are.
6756640	6757640	What have you been up to?
6757640	6761640	He can't take his eyes off that silly wooden lady.
6761640	6763640	He just dares at her.
6763640	6764640	Really?
6764640	6765640	I do not.
6765640	6768640	I just think she has a very beautiful face.
6768640	6772640	Well, Moomin, now that you're here, I could really do with your help.
6772640	6774640	What do you want, Snuffed Kid?
6774640	6778640	Mr. Hamilton dropped his box of samples down this hole and I'm going to try and get it.
6778640	6779640	I didn't drop it.
6779640	6783640	I fell in the hole and just forgot it when Snuffed can pull me out.
6783640	6785640	You're a bit absent-minded, Mr. Hamilton.
6785640	6786640	No, I'm not.
6786640	6790640	I can remember every Latin name of every single plant, you know.
6790640	6792640	Okay, I'll go down, Moomin.
6792640	6794640	But you'll have to help me get back up.
6794640	6795640	Okay.
6795640	6797640	I'll help you too.
6797640	6798640	Now be careful.
6798640	6800640	Can you see it yet, Snuffed Kid?
6800640	6802640	I'm not down at the bottom yet.
6802640	6803640	Oh, forgive me.
6803640	6804640	I'm sorry.
6804640	6805640	I found it.
6805640	6807640	Wonderful.
6807640	6810640	Tell me, are the plants all right?
6810640	6812640	You can check them yourself in a minute.
6816640	6817640	Oh.
6819640	6821640	Are you all right, Snuffed Kid?
6821640	6822640	Wait a minute.
6822640	6824640	I found something else.
6826640	6827640	Oh, look.
6827640	6829640	There's the boat.
6829640	6831640	It's Moomin, Moomin, Papa.
6832640	6833640	Hello.
6839640	6840640	It's gold.
6840640	6841640	Hello.
6841640	6843640	We've been hunting treasure.
6846640	6849640	Go and get Moomin, Papa. I found gold.
6849640	6852640	Boy, oh boy, I wonder how much there is.
6852640	6854640	Moomin, Papa, we'll know.
6863640	6867640	Well, Moomin, Papa, what should we do with all this beautiful gold?
6867640	6870640	It would look lovely in the garden, don't you think?
6870640	6873640	With all the shells that the snork made and found,
6873640	6875640	they'll look good in amongst the roses.
6875640	6877640	What do you think, Mama?
6877640	6879640	I'm sure they will, Papa.
6879640	6880640	I'm sure they will.
6885640	6888640	Moomin, she's only a stupid, legless doll.
6888640	6892640	You can have my bowl full of snowsknot, Maiden.
6892640	6893640	No, thanks.
6893640	6895640	Well, I'll look after it for you.
6895640	6897640	I can pretend it's my treasure.
6897640	6898640	Oh.
6904640	6908640	And that was the end of their first adventure in the new boat.
6908640	6913640	Moomin, Papa, decided that it was much more fun to set off without maps and sea charts.
6913640	6916640	You never know where you might end up.
6922640	6928640	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
6928640	6935640	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
6935640	6939640	They're always happy and always at play.
6939640	6943640	The movements are having fun day after day.
6943640	6946640	The movements.
6946640	6950640	The movements.
6950640	6957640	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
6957640	6964640	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
6964640	6969640	They're always happy and always at play.
6969640	6972640	The movements are having fun day after day.
6972640	6976640	The movements.
6976640	6980640	The movements.
6980640	6986640	The movements.
6986640	7008640	Here they are for one and all.
7008640	7011640	The movements are about to come.
7011640	7014640	Come on and sit down here with me.
7014640	7016640	They're here for you on your TV.
7016640	7019640	They are the movements.
7019640	7022640	They are the movements.
7022640	7025640	So come with me, give me your hand.
7025640	7028640	I'll take you up to a moment land.
7028640	7031640	You can fly just like a bird.
7031640	7033640	Sing that song ever.
7033640	7036640	There were the movements.
7036640	7039640	There were the movements.
7039640	7042640	There were the movements.
7042640	7045640	There were the movements.
7045640	7049640	There were the movements.
7079640	7084640	Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
7096640	7098640	Now it's very nice to get letters
7098640	7100640	at least every now and then
7100640	7105640	however in Moomin Valley they're rarely sent or received
7105640	7108640	and yet they do have letterboxes
7108640	7110640	and even postman
7115640	7118640	Oho! Moomin!
7121640	7123640	Hello! Is that for me?
7128640	7130640	A letter for the Moomin!
7131640	7133640	He's gonna fall in this time!
7133640	7134640	What?
7134640	7137640	Come on, this way, towards me, come on!
7138640	7139640	Come on!
7140640	7142640	Oh! I got him!
7142640	7144640	Did you dig that hole?
7144640	7146640	Yeah, no work, didn't it?
7147640	7150640	All right, who's responsible for this?
7150640	7152640	Are you all right?
7152640	7155640	Did you dig this hole, young Moomin?
7155640	7156640	Of course not!
7156640	7158640	Who was it then?
7159640	7161640	I knew I should have known!
7161640	7163640	Come here, you just wait!
7163640	7165640	Uh, hold on, Mr. Postman!
7165640	7167640	Can I help my letter, please?
7167640	7169640	Just do wait!
7189640	7191640	Here's the letter, Mama!
7194640	7195640	Hmm?
7195640	7197640	A goodness, a letter!
7197640	7199640	I think it's from Mumble!
7199640	7201640	Oh, really?
7201640	7203640	Where's Little Mai, Moomin?
7203640	7205640	Well, she's um...
7205640	7208640	So, who's this letter from?
7208640	7210640	It's from my sister Mumble, isn't it?
7210640	7212640	Oh, should I know?
7212640	7214640	She went on holiday to get away from me!
7214640	7217640	I bet she's coming back because she's missed all the fun!
7217640	7220640	She'd stay away if she had at least sensed!
7220640	7223640	This is the third time I've fallen into a hole!
7223640	7228640	Yes, I know, but this is only the first time I've seen you do it!
7228640	7231640	What a horrible little child you are!
7231640	7233640	Archie!
7233640	7234640	Whoop!
7234640	7235640	That was close!
7235640	7237640	Go on, follow us!
7237640	7238640	Whoop!
7238640	7240640	Whoop!
7240640	7241640	Whoop!
7241640	7244640	Come here, wait till I get my hands on you!
7245640	7247640	Mumble says that she's coming back!
7247640	7250640	She feels that she's ready to cope with Little Mai again!
7250640	7252640	Oh, that's good news, Moomin, Mama!
7252640	7255640	I think that we should go and give her house a good clean!
7255640	7258640	Have you told Little Mai now Mumble's coming?
7258640	7260640	She'll be able to go home!
7260640	7264640	No, I expect the postman is still chasing her around the garden!
7264640	7267640	Don't tell me why I don't want to know!
7269640	7270640	Mama!
7270640	7271640	Mama!
7271640	7273640	Is the letter from Mumble?
7273640	7275640	What does she have to say?
7275640	7277640	Is she coming home?
7280640	7284640	And a few days later, Mumble returned to Moomin Valley.
7286640	7290640	Now Mumble is a lot bigger and prettier than Little Mai,
7290640	7293640	and what's more, she's a lot quieter.
7295640	7298640	That's Moomin Valley, over there!
7298640	7301640	It's not full of creepy crawlies, is it?
7301640	7303640	Not as far as I know!
7304640	7306640	Is there a house over there?
7306640	7308640	Maybe there have food, let's go!
7308640	7310640	Oh, that's Moomin House!
7315640	7318640	Are you going to Moomin Valley, too?
7320640	7322640	Yes, we thought we would!
7322640	7324640	That's nice, so am I!
7324640	7326640	We can go together!
7327640	7329640	Your suitcase looks very heavy!
7329640	7331640	Would you like a hand with me?
7334640	7335640	Okay!
7335640	7338640	Are they nice to people that live in that house?
7338640	7340640	Yes, they are!
7340640	7342640	Can we stay there?
7342640	7343640	I'm sure you can!
7343640	7345640	My little sister is staying with them!
7345640	7347640	Follow me, I know the way!
7347640	7348640	Shall we go?
7353640	7355640	What's the matter?
7355640	7357640	Nothing! We're following you!
7357640	7359640	All right!
7366640	7368640	Mumbo!
7372640	7374640	Hello, how are you?
7374640	7375640	Fine, you!
7375640	7376640	Fine!
7376640	7378640	Do you have a nice rest without me?
7378640	7380640	Come on, everybody's waiting to see you!
7383640	7386640	Oh, by the way, I'm at two very small strangers who said they were coming here!
7387640	7389640	Coming here, Mumbo?
7389640	7393640	Yes, they're about the same size as Little Mai!
7393640	7397640	Both a bit odd and they're carrying a very large suitcase!
7397640	7401640	Right, I'd better make them up a small double bed then!
7401640	7403640	Thanks for the tea!
7403640	7406640	Now, are you ready to come home with me now, Little Mai?
7406640	7408640	No, not yet!
7408640	7410640	We've got to go home and tidy the house!
7410640	7412640	It hasn't been aired for the whole winter!
7412640	7414640	It's all right, Mumbo!
7414640	7419640	I cleaned and swept the floors the other day and opened all the doors and windows!
7419640	7421640	Thank you very much!
7421640	7426640	It must have been a relief to be asleep most of the time with Little Mai's been staying with you!
7426640	7429640	They said they haven't been bored once since we woke up!
7429640	7431640	And we've had a really good time together!
7431640	7433640	Isn't that right, Mumbo?
7436640	7438640	Bye now!
7440640	7442640	Well, well!
7442640	7444640	There's well, well me, Papa!
7444640	7448640	Just that I might be able to hear myself think again now!
7448640	7450640	I know what you mean!
7456640	7458640	You're not, thingamy!
7458640	7460640	No, it's your turn to be great!
7460640	7462640	What if they scream when they see us?
7462640	7465640	But the lady told us they would friendly thingamy!
7472640	7474640	Go on, do it!
7478640	7480640	Excuse me?
7491640	7494640	Now, what's the matter with you, too?
7494640	7497640	Don't forget your suitcase, will you?
7498640	7500640	What can we do?
7500640	7504640	It's all right, don't be frightened, I won't eat you!
7504640	7508640	I'm the police inspector here, been in the valley for years!
7508640	7510640	Police!
7510640	7511640	Oh no!
7511640	7513640	We're not thieves!
7513640	7515640	I'm all in the same day!
7515640	7517640	I'm all in the same day!
7517640	7520640	Well, nobody said that you did!
7520640	7523640	Then you haven't come to arrest us!
7523640	7524640	Have you?
7524640	7526640	Of course I haven't!
7526640	7528640	I've come to see the movement family!
7532640	7534640	It is ours, suitcase!
7534640	7535640	It is!
7535640	7537640	Of course it is!
7537640	7539640	Now, have you come to see the movements, too?
7541640	7542640	Hello?
7544640	7547640	Oh, there you are, I thought it was you!
7549640	7552640	Are you expecting these two guests, movement mama?
7552640	7554640	I think so!
7554640	7557640	And they've got a suitcase, so they must be staying!
7557640	7558640	That's nice!
7558640	7560640	You will stay, won't you?
7560640	7562640	Is it all right with you?
7562640	7564640	Of course it is!
7564640	7566640	I'm movement mama!
7566640	7569640	I'm thingany, and this is my friend Bob, movement mama!
7569640	7570640	You're welcome!
7570640	7573640	Come in and make yourselves at home!
7573640	7576640	I think it'll be okay, thingany.
7579640	7580640	Careful!
7580640	7581640	Hi!
7583640	7586640	They are a bit strange, aren't they?
7586640	7588640	Yes, definitely!
7588640	7590640	So, what can I do for you today, Inspector?
7590640	7595640	Oh, well, I heard that mumble was back from holiday, so...
7595640	7597640	Yes, that's right!
7597640	7598640	Oh!
7598640	7600640	Are you here now?
7600640	7604640	No inspector, I'm afraid she's gone home with little Mai!
7604640	7605640	Oh, right!
7605640	7608640	I have to keep an eye on things, you know?
7608640	7609640	Very important!
7609640	7612640	Who goes away? Who comes back?
7615640	7618640	Well, I'll say goodbye then, movement mama!
7620640	7623640	I do believe he's fallen for mumble!
7623640	7625640	But has she fallen for him?
7625640	7626640	I wonder!
7626640	7627640	What are the new guests doing?
7627640	7629640	Looking scared mostly!
7629640	7631640	Who one...
7631640	7632640	Do one...
7632640	7634640	Do one...
7639640	7641640	Do one...
7650640	7651640	Here you are!
7651640	7653640	I've emptied these drawers for you!
7653640	7654640	There should be enough room!
7654640	7656640	Thank you, movement!
7662640	7665640	Where should we put this suitcase?
7665640	7667640	Let's see!
7668640	7670640	In this drawer?
7673640	7675640	It's a good place to hide, too!
7675640	7677640	Oh, look at this!
7677640	7679640	It made such a pretty bad voice!
7679640	7681640	I like the movements!
7681640	7683640	They didn't scream at all!
7687640	7689640	You still gotta be careful, though!
7698640	7702640	We've had some very strange people staying at our house,
7702640	7705640	but I think these two are really weird!
7705640	7707640	Well, they're Northerners!
7707640	7710640	I guess so, with names like Thingamy and Bob!
7710640	7712640	And that suitcase?
7712640	7716640	They look a lot like fugitives to me, Snuffkin!
7716640	7719640	And perhaps they're dangerous criminals on the run?
7719640	7721640	Do you want to see them?
7721640	7724640	Yeah, I wouldn't mind, movement!
7728640	7729640	Ah!
7751640	7753640	Ah, there you are!
7753640	7755640	What are they doing now?
7755640	7756640	No idea!
7756640	7760640	I couldn't hear anything, so they must be asleep!
7760640	7762640	We think they're fugitives, movement, Papa!
7762640	7764640	They're probably on the run from the law!
7764640	7768640	Well, they are a bit funny about their suitcase!
7768640	7770640	Gold coins!
7770640	7772640	Stolen state secrets!
7772640	7773640	Arsonists!
7773640	7776640	We better hide all the matches, Papa!
7776640	7778640	Public enemies, numbers one and two,
7778640	7781640	but they don't look like it, though!
7781640	7783640	How about some tea?
7783640	7784640	Snuffkin? Smith?
7784640	7785640	Yes, please!
7785640	7787640	Any cakes as well?
7809640	7810640	Thingamy?
7815640	7816640	Oh!
7819640	7820640	Oh no!
7820640	7822640	This suitcase is gone, too!
7822640	7823640	What am I going to do?
7823640	7824640	Oh!
7824640	7826640	What am I going to do?
7826640	7828640	What am I going to do?
7828640	7829640	You wake already?
7829640	7830640	Oh!
7830640	7833640	What a nerfie you're doing under the bed!
7833640	7835640	It's the safest place!
7835640	7837640	Something's about to happen, though!
7837640	7838640	Ah!
7838640	7839640	I can feel her coming!
7839640	7841640	That's what woke me up!
7841640	7842640	Don't be silly!
7842640	7843640	She can't know we're here!
7843640	7844640	Yeah!
7844640	7845640	She can!
7845640	7847640	And I know she'll be here to hide!
7855640	7858640	Well, it's very windy tonight, moment!
7858640	7860640	Well, chilly, too!
7860640	7861640	Don't you think?
7861640	7864640	Oh, hello!
7867640	7869640	Did you sleep well?
7869640	7871640	Would you like some tea?
7871640	7873640	Hey, so that's them!
7873640	7874640	Don't worry!
7874640	7876640	These are good friends of mine!
7876640	7877640	Let me introduce you!
7877640	7879640	Sniff and Snuffkin!
7881640	7883640	And what's the matter?
7887640	7888640	She's coming!
7888640	7889640	Yes, she is!
7889640	7892640	Well, who is my dear?
7892640	7893640	The girl!
7893640	7894640	The girl!
7894640	7896640	Yes, she's terrible!
7896640	7897640	Who?
7898640	7900640	Oh, you know who she is?
7900640	7902640	Yes, I've never seen her!
7902640	7904640	But I've heard she's a scary monster, all right?
7904640	7905640	Scary monster?
7905640	7907640	And this, uh, grope is after you!
7907640	7909640	Yes, she is!
7922640	7923640	Now, don't you worry!
7923640	7926640	She'll think twice before she tangles with me!
7926640	7927640	Well, see?
7927640	7929640	If she's a scary monster!
7929640	7931640	Monster or not?
7931640	7934640	If you're a guest in Moomin House, nothing will harm you!
7934640	7935640	Right, everyone!
7935640	7938640	Lock all the doors and you two go to your room!
7938640	7940640	Thank you, Moomin Papa!
7940640	7942640	Nobody is going to get in here!
7942640	7944640	Well said!
7944640	7947640	To Am's family, to Am's!
7948640	7950640	Ready for more tea, anyone?
7952640	7954640	What's the matter?
7954640	7957640	We're going to be attacked by a huge scary monster!
7957640	7958640	Heavens!
7958640	7961640	You'd better get the frying pan, Mama!
7961640	7963640	Oh dear!
7967640	7971640	All right, has everyone got a weapon?
7984640	7987640	Alright, now, let's finish the list before we go!
8008640	8009640	What?
8014640	8016640	Well, it's midnight.
8016640	8019640	I don't believe in that stupid grog.
8019640	8021640	I hope you're right.
8029640	8031640	She's coming! She's here!
8031640	8033640	Yes, she's very close now.
8045640	8047640	I'm going home.
8049640	8050640	This is silly.
8050640	8052640	We can't wait up all night.
8052640	8054640	Besides, I'm getting very sleepy.
8055640	8056640	It's up to you.
8056640	8058640	Right. I'm going, man. Mom and Papa.
8058640	8059640	Watch your back.
8062640	8063640	Yes. Keep in the open.
8064640	8066640	You guys are only trying to frighten me.
8068640	8069640	Well, it won't work.
8075640	8076640	She's here.
8077640	8078640	No, she's not.
8078640	8080640	There are no such things as monsters.
8080640	8083640	Just a trap blowing a candle, though.
8093640	8095640	You see? There's nobody there.
8096640	8100640	Well, in that case, there's nothing to stop you going home, Sniff.
8105640	8107640	Do you think I'm scared?
8107640	8108640	You're making it up.
8108640	8109640	Come on, admit it.
8109640	8110640	There aren't any grog.
8111640	8113640	Not at all.
8128640	8130640	You see? There's no one here at all.
8134640	8135640	Oh.
8149640	8152640	Oh, be careful. Watch what you're doing.
8152640	8154640	It's here. It's here.
8154640	8155640	Where?
8155640	8159640	Right outside that door. Big and black and horrible.
8159640	8160640	Right.
8161640	8165640	No, don't open it. You'll get in.
8166640	8168640	Come on, everybody.
8174640	8176640	Well, there's nobody here, Sniff.
8176640	8177640	Are you sure?
8183640	8185640	I can't see anything.
8186640	8190640	Well, I must have scared that silly old grog away, moment.
8191640	8194640	That will teach her to come sniffing around here, all right?
8194640	8196640	No, that she is.
8210640	8213640	Mm-hmm. Mrs. Groke, we'd like you to go home.
8213640	8215640	Now, you just go on.
8217640	8219640	You're upsetting our guests.
8219640	8221640	And you're freezing my roses.
8221640	8223640	Yes, you've been bullied.
8224640	8227640	I'm sorry, but you really must leave.
8227640	8229640	Please go before I count to ten.
8229640	8242640	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine and a half.
8244640	8246640	All right.
8267640	8270640	All right.
8270640	8272640	Hey.
8272640	8274640	What?
8275640	8277640	Hey, are you all right, moment?
8277640	8279640	Look at the ground.
8281640	8283640	It's all frozen.
8293640	8296640	That's a Groke's voice.
8296640	8298640	It's cold.
8298640	8299640	Isn't it?
8299640	8301640	I don't think she'll be back tonight.
8301640	8304640	Let's all go in and have a hot drink.
8305640	8308640	The Groke didn't come back that night.
8308640	8311640	But what did she want in movement house?
8311640	8318640	And will she return perhaps another night when they're all asleep?
8319640	8325640	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
8326640	8333640	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
8333640	8337640	They're always happy and always at play.
8337640	8341640	The movements are having fun day after day.
8341640	8344640	The movements.
8344640	8348640	The movements.
8348640	8354640	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
8355640	8362640	Believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
8362640	8366640	They're always happy and always at play.
8366640	8370640	The movements are having fun day after day.
8370640	8373640	The movements.
8373640	8377640	The movements.
8377640	8384640	The movements.
8384640	8391640	The movements.
8391640	8397640	The movements.
8397640	8403640	The movements.
8403640	8409640	The movements.
8409640	8412640	The movements.
8412640	8415640	They're for you on your TV.
8415640	8418640	They are the movements.
8418640	8421640	They are the movements.
8421640	8424640	So come with me, give me your hand.
8424640	8427640	I'll take you up to a moment land.
8427640	8430640	You can fly just like a bird.
8430640	8433640	Sing that song ever.
8433640	8436640	There were the movements.
8436640	8439640	There were the movements.
8439640	8442640	There were the movements.
8442640	8445640	There were the movements.
8445640	8449640	There were the movements.
8469640	8479640	There were the movements.
8479640	8483640	There were the movements.
8500640	8504640	With all the excitement of that night,
8504640	8509640	Sniff decided not to go home and was sharing movement's bed.
8509640	8513640	Snuffkin, as always, preferred to sleep in his tent.
8513640	8515640	You remember what happened?
8515640	8521640	The horrible grok coming after thingamy and bob and everything freezing?
8521640	8528640	For a moment, however, the night wasn't quite over yet.
8529640	8533640	Mommy, papa, help me.
8533640	8538640	The grok is after me.
8538640	8546640	I can't run anymore.
8547640	8551640	I can't run anymore.
8569640	8572640	Why am I on the floor?
8572640	8575640	Sniff?
8577640	8581640	Good morning, mama.
8581640	8583640	Good morning, moving.
8583640	8584640	Is Sniff up yet?
8584640	8586640	You're joking.
8586640	8588640	Where's the thingamy and bob?
8588640	8590640	They haven't stirred yet.
8590640	8595640	The poor things are tired out.
8595640	8597640	Papa's not still asleep, is he?
8597640	8602640	No, he's looking at my rose bushes.
8602640	8604640	Are they okay, papa?
8604640	8607640	No, frozen to death and look.
8607640	8608640	What?
8608640	8615640	That's where she was standing over there where the grass is dead.
8615640	8618640	She must have been real cold to freeze the roses.
8618640	8620640	What a shame. They were very pretty.
8620640	8622640	There's not much left of them now.
8622640	8625640	We'll have to grow some new ones.
8625640	8628640	I dreamed that she was chasing me, papa.
8628640	8629640	Oh, don't worry, moment.
8629640	8632640	I think she's only after thingamy and bob.
8632640	8635640	So they're not fugitives from justice after all?
8635640	8639640	I have a feeling that they would prefer that moment.
8647640	8649640	Aren't thingamy and bob coming down?
8649640	8652640	Yes, if they could have breakfast in their room if you didn't mind.
8652640	8654640	Well, what did they tell you?
8654640	8655640	What?
8655640	8657640	About why the groke is chasing them.
8657640	8662640	Oh, they just looked terrified and wouldn't say anything about her at all.
8662640	8665640	You know, we really ought to find out why.
8665640	8667640	Yes, you're right.
8667640	8671640	Mom and mom, why don't you take their breakfast up and see if they'll tell you anything
8671640	8674640	if any of us can get it out of the mucan?
8687640	8689640	Who's that?
8689640	8692640	It's only me. I've brought you both a nice breakfast.
8710640	8713640	Well, what did they say?
8713640	8716640	It seems that the groke is after the suitcase.
8716640	8717640	Not them.
8717640	8721640	I wonder what's in it, perhaps they've stolen her mummy as well.
8721640	8725640	And they also said that it did use to belong to her.
8725640	8728640	Oh, dear, if they've stolen it.
8728640	8730640	I don't know about that.
8730640	8734640	I asked them how they got it, but they wouldn't say another word.
8734640	8735640	Well, this is too much.
8735640	8737640	We could be harboring criminals.
8737640	8741640	I know they don't look like it, but you never know, do you?
8741640	8743640	You can ask the groke.
8743640	8745640	Shh, don't shout.
8745640	8750640	No, that's no good. We don't want to come back here most definitely.
8750640	8753640	Let's ask the police inspector to question them.
8753640	8755640	We don't want to get the police involved.
8755640	8757640	Well, you'll suggest something, Anne.
8757640	8759640	Quit shouting, sniff.
8762640	8766640	Look, why don't you just wait for them to tell you a moment?
8766640	8771640	I know it seems strange, but I've noticed that if you pretend not to be interested,
8771640	8773640	people can't wait to tell you their secrets.
8773640	8777640	They told Mama about the suitcase, but they wouldn't say anything to Papa.
8777640	8779640	You know something, Moomin?
8779640	8781640	They might open up to Snark Maiden.
8781640	8783640	She's someone more their own age.
8783640	8785640	You could be right.
8789640	8791640	Hey, Snark Maiden.
8791640	8792640	Where are you going?
8792640	8794640	Moomin house.
8794640	8795640	I'll come with you.
8795640	8798640	But I thought you were living there.
8798640	8800640	I was until Mumble came back yesterday.
8800640	8802640	How is she?
8802640	8805640	She's not bossy, and she snores too.
8805640	8807640	Moomin.
8807640	8808640	Snark Maiden.
8808640	8810640	Where are you off to?
8810640	8812640	Well, I was just on my way to see you.
8812640	8816640	Oh, that's so nice, and I've come to see you, Moomin.
8816640	8819640	I brought you a little present, Moomin.
8819640	8821640	A present for me.
8821640	8823640	Yes, and it's very beautiful.
8823640	8824640	What is it?
8824640	8826640	Something you must never break or lose.
8826640	8828640	I promise I won't.
8828640	8829640	There you are.
8829640	8830640	Thank you.
8830640	8832640	Come on, open it.
8836640	8839640	A lot of beautiful shell.
8839640	8843640	I spent all of yesterday on the beach searching for it just for you.
8843640	8845640	Look, we can see ourselves in it.
8845640	8846640	So we can.
8846640	8848640	Thank you very much, Snark Maiden.
8848640	8851640	It's my heart, and I want you to look after her.
8851640	8853640	Oh, I will, Snark Maiden.
8853640	8854640	I will.
8854640	8856640	I'll think of you whenever I look at it.
8856640	8857640	I'm Moomin.
8857640	8863640	I promise you that I'll always kiss the shell before I go to sleep.
8863640	8866640	It will be my most precious treasure.
8866640	8869640	Apart from me?
8869640	8871640	So what shall I do?
8871640	8873640	Take them for a walk?
8873640	8876640	Yes, but take your time and don't rush them.
8876640	8878640	I'll let them cry on my shoulder.
8878640	8880640	Yes, and try and talk to them as well, though.
8880640	8884640	I feel very important and a little bit nervous, too.
8884640	8886640	Have some tea first.
8886640	8889640	Thank you, Moomin, Mama.
8899640	8901640	We don't need your help, little Mai.
8901640	8902640	Ah, that's what you think.
8902640	8904640	I'd be able to weedle out their secrets.
8904640	8906640	It's not an interrogation.
8906640	8908640	We only want to talk to them, you know.
8908640	8910640	So you can weedle out their secrets.
8910640	8911640	I'll be very quiet.
8911640	8915640	Little Mai, have you ever managed to be very quiet?
8915640	8918640	Not really, but there's only one way to find out.
8918640	8920640	You must let me go with Snork Maiden.
8920640	8925640	No, this situation needs a tender understanding, Moomin.
8925640	8928640	That's me, exactly.
8928640	8929640	You ready?
8929640	8931640	I suppose so.
8931640	8932640	Hello, it's Moomin.
8932640	8936640	Can I talk to you for a minute?
8936640	8939640	Hello?
8939640	8941640	This is Snork Maiden.
8941640	8943640	She's a very good friend of mine.
8943640	8946640	Hello, I'm very happy to meet you both.
8946640	8948640	She's very tender and understanding,
8948640	8950640	and she'd like to talk to you.
8950640	8953640	Can she come in?
8953640	8958640	Well, if she has to, Moomin.
8958640	8962640	Come in, Mai.
8962640	8967640	You pee, you pee, you pee.
8967640	8971640	It's very beautiful, a perfect heart shape.
8971640	8974640	I've never seen anything like it, Moomin.
8974640	8976640	Would you like one, Mama?
8976640	8977640	No, my dear.
8977640	8979640	There should only be one shell like this.
8979640	8982640	Then would you keep it somewhere safe for me?
8988640	8991640	Well, Snork Maiden.
8991640	8994640	I'm sure Snork Maiden will get it out of him.
8994640	8995640	I do hope so.
8995640	8998640	I think they like it anyway.
8998640	9002640	I have a feeling in my bones that Groke will be back tonight.
9002640	9006640	If we could find out why she's after them, we'd know what to do.
9006640	9011640	Mama won't have any garden left if that monster comes back every night.
9011640	9014640	Moomin.
9020640	9024640	Well done, Snork Maiden.
9025640	9028640	Little Mai.
9031640	9035640	Oh no, she'll ruin everything if we don't stop her.
9039640	9042640	If you interfere, little Mai, I'll never forgive you.
9042640	9045640	What, interfere? Me? Never.
9045640	9048640	Look, let's just leave it up to Snork Maiden now, little Mai.
9048640	9052640	You'll need me if Snork Maiden's not tender and understanding enough.
9052640	9055640	Hey, Moomin.
9055640	9059640	So, how is Snork Maiden getting on her, taking them for a stroll?
9059640	9062640	Where are they?
9069640	9071640	If we were narrow.
9071640	9073640	Papa, if we get much closer.
9073640	9077640	And the last thing we want is for them to see us.
9077640	9080640	Looks like I'll have to go and talk to them. You're all too big.
9080640	9082640	I'll come back later and tell you what they said.
9082640	9085640	No, don't. You'll upset Snork Maiden.
9085640	9087640	You're the one who's upsetting her.
9087640	9089640	Shh.
9089640	9093640	All right. Can I ask you again about the suitcase?
9093640	9094640	Yes.
9094640	9097640	Does that suitcase belong to you or is it the Groakes?
9097640	9099640	No.
9101640	9105640	Let's try it another way. Who's is that suitcase?
9105640	9108640	It's ours, it's ours.
9108640	9113640	But you told Moomin Mama that it wasn't yours. It was the Groakes.
9113640	9115640	Yes, we did.
9115640	9117640	Oh.
9117640	9121640	Do you mind if I ask you one more time?
9121640	9123640	Please do.
9123640	9125640	Right. Here we go.
9125640	9128640	Now, all I want is a simple yes or no.
9128640	9130640	Is that suitcase yours or not?
9130640	9132640	No, yes.
9132640	9134640	Oh.
9134640	9136640	Take your time, Snork Maiden.
9136640	9138640	Don't rush them, he said.
9138640	9140640	What was that Snork Maiden?
9140640	9144640	Look, I'm sorry, but can I ask you again?
9144640	9146640	Yes, as many times as you want.
9146640	9149640	Thank you. This is the very last time.
9149640	9151640	So please tell me the truth.
9154640	9156640	Now then, the suitcase.
9156640	9157640	Yes.
9157640	9158640	You know which one?
9158640	9159640	Yes.
9159640	9161640	Does it belong to you?
9161640	9162640	Yes, it does.
9162640	9164640	So it's not the Groakes.
9164640	9165640	Yes, it is not the Groakes.
9165640	9169640	At last, we're getting somewhere, praise the booble.
9169640	9172640	We're very happy for you.
9172640	9175640	Snork Maiden is really having to work hard.
9175640	9177640	I wouldn't have, I'd scare them into talking.
9177640	9179640	You should have let me go.
9179640	9181640	Yeah, but we wanted someone gentle.
9181640	9183640	Snork Maiden is nice.
9183640	9186640	Everybody in this house is nice.
9186640	9189640	Do you think they'd let us stay here forever?
9189640	9190640	Of course.
9190640	9193640	If we can keep away from the Groak.
9195640	9199640	It took a long time, but in the end they trusted me, and now we're good friends.
9199640	9202640	Who wouldn't trust you and want to be good friends?
9202640	9205640	Thank you. It wasn't easy, though.
9205640	9208640	They kept speaking together, and I got rather muddled.
9208640	9210640	But they did tell me somehow.
9210640	9211640	Rather muddled.
9211640	9213640	I told you guys, you should have let me do it.
9213640	9216640	Oh, I'm afraid I didn't get very much, though.
9216640	9218640	I knew you wouldn't.
9218640	9222640	So what did you find out then, Snork Maiden?
9222640	9223640	Tell us.
9223640	9226640	Well, first of all, the suitcase does seem to be theirs.
9226640	9228640	That was one thing they made very clear.
9228640	9230640	Then Hulk and the Groak, just a minute movement,
9230640	9234640	what's in the suitcase on the other hand, belongs to the Groak.
9234640	9236640	That's the problem.
9236640	9237640	Oh, dear.
9237640	9240640	So they do have something belonging to a...
9240640	9242640	Well, Snork Maiden, what is it?
9242640	9244640	They wouldn't tell me what it is, little Mai.
9244640	9248640	Only that it is the most beautiful thing in the world.
9248640	9249640	So, is it?
9249640	9251640	I wonder.
9252640	9254640	This is very difficult to understand.
9254640	9258640	I mean, thingamy and Bob don't look like thieves at all, do they?
9258640	9261640	So, the Groak just wanted back what is hers.
9261640	9266640	I don't see how that big ugly monster could own the most beautiful thing in the world.
9266640	9269640	Well, what they said was that she just happened to have it.
9269640	9272640	They didn't say whether it belonged to her or not.
9272640	9274640	So she might have stolen it herself.
9274640	9276640	They shouldn't have taken it, though.
9276640	9278640	Oh, dear, oh dear.
9278640	9283640	Bob and Thingamy are very frightened of how she'll take her revenge if she catches them.
9283640	9287640	But they're very determined to keep what's in the suitcase, Moomin Papa.
9287640	9290640	Oh, this is a fine mess indeed.
9290640	9292640	The Groak is sure to come back tonight.
9292640	9293640	What can we do?
9293640	9295640	What can we do?
9295640	9296640	What can we do?
9296640	9298640	We can do the same as before.
9298640	9300640	Yeah, but it's not fair to drive her away.
9300640	9304640	If what's in the suitcase really does belong to her?
9304640	9309640	She means to get the suitcase and I don't think it will be so easy to get rid of her this time.
9309640	9313640	And if she stays, we'll have a never-ending winter.
9313640	9316640	Well, I'll cover up the petunias just in case.
9316640	9318640	Are you all going to stay here?
9318640	9319640	I'll look after Snork.
9319640	9321640	I will, Moomin Mama, I'll stay.
9321640	9323640	You'll stay, won't you, Snefkin?
9323640	9325640	Don't look so clump, everyone.
9325640	9326640	I've got an idea.
9326640	9329640	But it would help if we knew what was in that suitcase.
9329640	9331640	But even if we didn't, it could still work.
9331640	9333640	What is it, dear?
9333640	9336640	Just wait, Papa. You'll see.
9394640	9395640	Oh!
9407640	9409640	She's coming!
9409640	9410640	Are we?
9410640	9412640	She's out of her way!
9412640	9414640	Oh, I hope Moomin Papa can do something.
9414640	9416640	It's your girl, little mom.
9416640	9419640	Yes, I know. There's the king and the queen.
9419640	9421640	Uh, this one.
9421640	9423640	Uh-oh, she's coming.
9423640	9425640	Just when I was winning.
9425640	9428640	You better hide under the table, little my.
9428640	9432640	Don't be stupid. How can I hit her with my rolling pin from there?
9441640	9443640	Where is she, Papa?
9443640	9445640	Exactly where she was yesterday.
9445640	9447640	I'll go for a toast, alright, Papa?
9447640	9452640	Let me go first, and then the rest of you can fan out behind me.
9452640	9454640	Moomin Mama.
9454640	9455640	What is it, Papa?
9455640	9458640	Perhaps now's the time to tell us your idea.
9458640	9460640	We haven't long.
9473640	9475640	Wait, Grog.
9475640	9478640	Don't go away. We want to talk to you.
9478640	9484640	We know that you've come back to get what thing of me and Bob took from you.
9484640	9487640	That is right, isn't it, huh?
9488640	9492640	Won't you let them keep it, perhaps?
9494640	9497640	No, will you sell it to them?
9499640	9501640	Oh, dear.
9501640	9505640	I have some very beautiful things here in my bag.
9505640	9508640	Maybe you'd like to trade, Grog.
9517640	9519640	What about this pendant?
9519640	9521640	Isn't it lovely?
9524640	9527640	So you don't like that?
9527640	9529640	What about this then?
9532640	9534640	Or this?
9541640	9544640	Alright, why don't you choose?
9544640	9548640	Take anything you want from my handbag, except the hair slide.
9556640	9559640	Which one do you want, this one?
9560640	9562640	Let me see with this.
9564640	9566640	Oh, this one?
9568640	9571640	Oh, dear, that's not really mine to give to you.
9571640	9573640	Snork maiden gave that to Moomin.
9573640	9576640	Is it alright if I give the shell to her Moomin?
9578640	9580640	Oh, you'll never allow.
9580640	9582640	Are you alright?
9582640	9585640	Yes, my hand was suddenly frozen.
9586640	9588640	No, you've got the shell, Mrs. Grog.
9588640	9591640	Do you promise not to come back anymore?
9594640	9597640	Because I'll get you if you do.
9598640	9602640	Oh, my God!
9612640	9614640	Well, that was a close thing.
9614640	9616640	I'm glad that's over.
9616640	9619640	Oh, you are marvelous, Mama.
9621640	9623640	I'm so sorry, Moomin.
9623640	9627640	I forgot that I had put your precious shell in my handbag to keep it safe.
9627640	9629640	It's alright, Mama.
9629640	9631640	You gave it in a good cause.
9632640	9635640	What Snork maiden gonna say, Moomin?
9636640	9637640	I heard you.
9637640	9639640	You said you'd never go to sleep without kissing it.
9639640	9641640	Or something equally stupid.
9642640	9644640	Well, I'm not gonna tell Snork maiden.
9644640	9647640	But I think Mama did the right thing.
9648640	9649640	She'll find out.
9649640	9651640	I'm fed up with secrets.
9651640	9654640	I'm always gonna tell the truth from now on, no matter what.
9664640	9665640	Moomin, Moomin!
9665640	9667640	Look, I found one.
9667640	9668640	Really?
9669640	9671640	Well, it's very similar.
9671640	9674640	But the one Snork maiden gave me was much bigger.
9674640	9676640	Oh, a lot bigger, was it?
9676640	9681640	Moomin had decided that he had to find a shell that was exactly the same as the one Snork maiden had given him.
9681640	9685640	Then with luck, she would never find out what he'd done with it.
9699640	9701640	This is it!
9701640	9702640	This is it!
9702640	9704640	I killed it!
9707640	9709640	It's exactly the same as the other one!
9710640	9712640	Nothing short of a miracle, isn't it?
9712640	9715640	But then in Moomin Valley, miracles do happen.
9718640	9724640	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
9724640	9731640	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
9732640	9736640	They're always happy and always at play.
9736640	9740640	The movements are having fun day after day.
9740640	9743640	The movements.
9743640	9747640	The movements.
9747640	9754640	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
9754640	9760640	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
9762640	9765640	They're always happy and always at play.
9765640	9769640	The movements are having fun day after day.
9769640	9772640	The movements.
9772640	9776640	The movements.
9776640	9782640	The movements.
9792640	9797640	The movements.
9802640	9805640	Here they are for one and all.
9805640	9808640	The movements are about to come.
9808640	9811640	Come on and sit down here with me.
9811640	9816640	There for you on your TV they are the movements.
9816640	9819640	They are the movements.
9819640	9822640	Don't come with me, give me your hand.
9822640	9825640	I'll take you up to Moomin Land.
9825640	9828640	You can fly just like a bird.
9828640	9830640	Sing that song ever.
9830640	9833640	There were the movements.
9833640	9836640	There were the movements.
9836640	9839640	There were the movements.
9839640	9842640	There were the movements.
9842640	9845640	There were the movements.
9845640	9848640	There were the movements.
9848640	9878640	Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

9908640	9910640	Oops!
9910640	9912640	Oh, thank you, Mama.
9912640	9914640	We weren't looking where we were going.
9914640	9916640	That's all right.
9918640	9919640	Here's your bag.
9919640	9920640	Thank you, Thingamy.
9920640	9921640	Are you going out?
9921640	9923640	Yes, for a walk.
9923640	9924640	We'll have fun.
9930640	9935640	It seems that Thingamy and Bob are well and truly part of Movement House now.
9935640	9937640	Luckily, they don't eat a lot.
9937640	9943640	And they're small enough to find the pencils that fall between the floorboards in the porch.
9947640	9949640	Hey, this looks like a great hiding place.
9949640	9951640	Nobody would ever find it here.
9953640	9956640	Come on, Bob. Let's go get the suitcase, man.
9956640	9958640	Are you sure it's not safe for an alarm?
9960640	9963640	What would you say if someone went in when we weren't there?
9963640	9965640	You wouldn't like it, would you?
9967640	9971640	I think the Moomons are much too nice to do anything like that.
9971640	9974640	It's not them. It's the guests I'm thinking about.
9974640	9977640	You know the Moomons let anybody stay.
9979640	9981640	Snork Maiden.
9982640	9984640	You lied to me, little Mai.
9984640	9985640	Who me?
9985640	9988640	Moomons still has the shell that I gave him.
9988640	9990640	But you said that he didn't.
9990640	9991640	And possible.
9991640	9993640	Moom and Mama gave it to the croak.
9993640	9995640	I was there when she did it.
9995640	9998640	Look, I saw it. He showed it to me.
9998640	10000640	Are you really sure? Was it the same one?
10000640	10003640	Of course it was. I'm not stupid, you know.
10003640	10007640	That's very odd. I saw her do it with my own eyes.
10007640	10010640	Well, I'll go and ask Moomons right now, little Mai.
10010640	10014640	It's a bit awkward. But if I'm going to be honest, Snork Maiden.
10014640	10020640	What? Well, I've decided that from now on I'm only going to tell the truth.
10020640	10021640	Oh, yes.
10021640	10023640	And I found something you might be interested in.
10023640	10025640	Well, what is it?
10025640	10027640	Mungle and I were down on the beach yesterday.
10027640	10030640	And you remember all those things we found washed up by the storm?
10030640	10034640	Do you mean on the Hattie Fatter's island that we sailed to?
10034640	10038640	Yes. And do you remember the figurehead that Moomon liked best of all?
10038640	10041640	You know, the lady made of wood and painted.
10041640	10043640	She was really lovely, wasn't she?
10043640	10045640	Yes, I remember.
10045640	10046640	Moomon wanted to keep it.
10046640	10048640	So what about it?
10048640	10049640	Well, it's here on the beach.
10049640	10051640	It was still the same.
10052640	10054640	As beautiful as ever.
10054640	10055640	Was it the same one?
10055640	10057640	Yes, I remember her pretty face.
10057640	10058640	No legs, though.
10058640	10060640	She's just a silly wooden doll.
10060640	10062640	Oh, I know that.
10062640	10065640	But she's got those gorgeous eyes in lovely long hair.
10065640	10069640	Little Mai, why all this fuss about this silly figurehead?
10069640	10070640	Trust him.
10070640	10073640	Only someone as stupid as Moomon could fall in love with a figurehead.
10073640	10076640	It's probably still dreaming about her every night.
10076640	10078640	Do you think it's still there?
10078640	10081640	Charles Nork Maiden, if no one else has found her already.
10081640	10085640	Do you think the ocean might come and wash her away again?
10085640	10088640	Why all these silly questions, Nork Maiden?
10088640	10091640	Moomon would go and rescue her if he knew.
10091640	10092640	So?
10092640	10093640	That would be terrible.
10093640	10095640	I couldn't bear it at all.
10095640	10096640	I really couldn't.
10096640	10098640	How pathetic.
10098640	10103640	He'll probably take her home and keep her in his room forever.
10103640	10106640	My expect she's too big to go through the door.
10106640	10110640	He'll just sit and stare at her with that lovesick look on his face.
10110640	10111640	I know he will.
10111640	10112640	Oh!
10112640	10113640	Where are you going now?
10113640	10115640	I thought you were going to Moomon house.
10115640	10118640	I was, but there's something more important I have to do.
10123640	10125640	Okay, it's Chris.
10126640	10129640	Hey, you two, you're not leaving, are you?
10129640	10131640	No, we're just, uh, we're going.
10131640	10134640	Why have you got the suitcase, then?
10134640	10137640	Look, Moomon, would you help us with something?
10137640	10139640	Of course.
10142640	10144640	Thank you very much, Moomon.
10144640	10145640	Oh, that's okay.
10145640	10148640	It's a bit too big for you to go.
10148640	10150640	I'm sorry.
10150640	10152640	Thank you very much, Moomon.
10152640	10153640	Oh, that's okay.
10153640	10155640	It's a bit too big for you to carry.
10155640	10157640	We can take it from here.
10157640	10158640	It's all right.
10158640	10160640	It's not very heavy.
10162640	10163640	Oh, silly me.
10163640	10166640	It wouldn't be a very secret place if I'd seen it.
10166640	10167640	Would it?
10167640	10168640	I'll see you later.
10168640	10169640	Don't be too long now.
10169640	10171640	How much you won't tell anyone, will you?
10171640	10173640	Of course I won't.
10173640	10175640	Oh, oh, oh.
10175640	10179640	Hey, what are you doing up there, little my?
10179640	10180640	I'm coming down.
10180640	10182640	What does it look like?
10182640	10184640	You're much too small to do, there.
10184640	10187640	The rungs are too far apart for you to reach.
10187640	10188640	Just you watch me.
10188640	10189640	Oh.
10189640	10190640	Oh.
10190640	10191640	Oh.
10191640	10192640	Oh.
10192640	10193640	Oh.
10193640	10194640	Oh.
10194640	10195640	Oh.
10195640	10196640	Oh.
10196640	10197640	Oh.
10197640	10198640	Oh.
10198640	10199640	Oh.
10199640	10201640	Hey, what are you doing up there, little my?
10202640	10203640	Oh.
10203640	10205640	Oh.
10208640	10211640	Moonman, I have a problem.
10211640	10213640	Do you mind if I ask you something?
10213640	10214640	Go ahead.
10214640	10218640	Did Moonman Mama give Snorkman's hard shape shell to the goat?
10218640	10220640	Yes, she did.
10220640	10223640	So you and the Groek can't both have it, can you?
10223640	10226640	That's just where you're wrong.
10226640	10230140	But that's simply impossible you can't have.
10230140	10232940	The Groke's simply got another one.
10232940	10234740	That's not true!
10234740	10238340	All right, but it would only upset Snorke made an if she knew.
10238340	10240140	So I'm not going to tell her.
10240140	10241340	You rotten thing!
10241340	10243340	Why don't you just tell me the truth?
10243340	10244940	Because it's a secret.
10244940	10246340	But I want to know, Moomin!
10247340	10248340	Look, Moomin!
10248340	10252340	Now, why don't you tell me your secret and then I'll tell you mine!
10252340	10253340	What is it?
10253340	10255140	Really very top secret.
10255140	10256940	Go on then, tell me.
10257740	10259140	Tell me yours first.
10259340	10261340	No, you tell me first.
10261340	10263540	I know, let's say them together.
10263540	10264740	All right.
10264740	10266140	Ready?
10266140	10267940	One, two, three.
10267940	10270140	After we go to the show and I went to the beach yesterday,
10270140	10271140	I would like to be there.
10271140	10272340	We'll find something that you like.
10272340	10274340	Please, so I'll have a bigger head later.
10274340	10275340	I just like it.
10276340	10277340	What did you say?
10277340	10278340	The figurehead?
10278340	10279340	Yes, by the K.
10280740	10281740	Wait a minute!
10281740	10283740	You didn't finish telling me your secret!
10283740	10285140	I'll tell you later!
10285140	10286140	That's not there!
10286140	10288140	You've got to tell me now!
10290140	10291140	Oh!
10311140	10313140	What do you think Moomin's doing?
10313140	10314140	I don't know.
10314140	10316140	Maybe he's looking for shells again.
10317140	10319140	I don't think so.
10319140	10321140	He looks a bit worried to me.
10321140	10324140	Maybe he's lost something important.
10328140	10331140	How much further do we have to go?
10331140	10333140	As far as you can road.
10333140	10335140	We're a long way out already, you know.
10335140	10338140	I want to make sure that the lady will never turn up again.
10338140	10340140	We must go further out.
10340140	10342140	We must be far enough by now.
10342140	10343140	I'm tired.
10344140	10345140	No!
10345140	10347140	The curds could still drag her in from here.
10347140	10348140	Keep going!
10358140	10360140	He looks very unhappy.
10360140	10361140	We've got to cheer him up.
10361140	10362140	But how?
10362140	10364140	There's only one way, Bob.
10364140	10366140	Yes, you're right, thing of me.
10374140	10376140	Hello.
10376140	10378140	You look so sad, Moomin.
10378140	10381140	But we thought we'd try to make you happy again.
10384140	10386140	You don't mind, do you?
10386140	10388140	No, but you don't have to.
10388140	10390140	I'm alright, really.
10392140	10394140	How about this then, Moomin?
10394140	10396140	We're going to show you what's in our suitcase.
10396140	10397140	Go!
10397140	10398140	Would you like that, Moomin?
10398140	10400140	It's very interesting.
10400140	10402140	Oh my gosh!
10402140	10404140	Will you?
10412140	10414140	Do you need some help in there?
10414140	10416140	No, I think we can manage.
10421140	10423140	Thank you, Moomin.
10424140	10425140	Now we'll open it.
10425140	10426140	Yes, now.
10426140	10428140	One, two, three.
10428140	10430140	Oh gosh!
10430140	10432140	By my tail.
10434140	10435140	Do you like it?
10435140	10437140	Oh boy, do I like it?
10437140	10439140	Then you're not sad anymore, Moomin.
10439140	10440140	Oh no!
10440140	10442140	That's good, isn't it?
10442140	10444140	Yes, very good.
10448140	10451140	It was such a beautiful ruby.
10451140	10455140	How it changed color from soft red to soft red blue
10455140	10456140	and then to pink?
10456140	10459140	One minute, it was like a flame leaping out of the center.
10459140	10461140	Then suddenly it was like a blood tulip.
10461140	10462140	It was...
10462140	10465140	Hmm, perhaps that's the king's ruby.
10465140	10468140	It was just beautiful.
10468140	10470140	That's the one the hob goblin is searching for.
10470140	10472140	Oh, no.
10472140	10476140	However far away he is, he'll come back on his black panther, looking for it.
10476140	10478140	And he's sure to find it.
10478140	10481140	Because he'll know that thing of me and Bob have it.
10481140	10483140	First the Groke and now the hob goblin.
10483140	10485140	What are we going to do?
10489140	10491140	No more than a week later,
10491140	10493140	and like a bolt from the blue,
10493140	10496140	a real catastrophe hit Moomin Valley.
10500140	10502140	Hmm.
10502140	10504140	No, it's not in the bedroom either.
10504140	10506140	Oh, that's very odd.
10506140	10508140	Where did you see it last?
10508140	10510140	I'm sure it was here somewhere, Papa.
10510140	10513140	Well, perhaps it's in the garden.
10515140	10518140	No, I haven't been out here all day.
10519140	10521140	Moomin Mama's handbag is missing.
10521140	10525140	Full of useful things like socks and sweets and string.
10529140	10530140	What's the matter, Mama?
10530140	10533140	I can't find my handbag and I'm lost without it.
10533140	10534140	We've looked everywhere.
10534140	10537140	Will I get a reward if I find it, Moomin Mama?
10537140	10540140	Yes, we'll have a big party for everyone
10540140	10542140	with cakes, jelly, and everything.
10542140	10546140	And as a special treat, no one has to wash or go to bed early.
10547140	10548140	I'll find it, Mama.
10548140	10549140	No, I will.
10556140	10558140	Moomin Mama, I've checked the cellar.
10558140	10559140	It's not there.
10559140	10561140	Oh, dear, where could it be?
10561140	10563140	I haven't been in the cellar for days,
10563140	10565140	so I didn't think it would be there,
10565140	10567140	but thank you, dear Snork.
10576140	10579140	Word got round Moomin Valley of the missing handbag,
10579140	10582140	and soon everyone was helping to look for it.
10585140	10587140	What a lot of people.
10587140	10589140	I wonder what they're looking for.
10598140	10600140	What's everybody looking for?
10600140	10602140	My handbag, thingamy.
10602140	10605140	The one with the two nice little pockets?
10605140	10606140	Yes, that's the one.
10606140	10608140	It's been missing for days.
10608140	10610140	Will you two help us look?
10613140	10617140	It makes such a lovely place to sleep, and don't you think?
10620140	10622140	Moomin Mama looks very sad.
10622140	10624140	Perhaps we better give it back.
10636140	10637140	Oh.
10641140	10644140	Oh, you found it.
10645140	10648140	Look, everybody, thingamy and Bob have found it.
10654140	10656140	Oh, thank you.
10656140	10658140	Where on earth did you find it?
10658140	10660140	In the bush under the white birch tree.
10660140	10663140	It's a very, very nice handbag.
10663140	10668140	Let's have a party tonight to celebrate the return of Mama's handbag.
10670140	10674140	As you all know, this party is in honor of thingamy and Bob,
10674140	10676140	finding Moomin Mama's handbag,
10676140	10679140	and to thank everyone who took part in the big search.
10680140	10682140	Let's raise our glasses to our heroes.
10682140	10684140	Is to thingamy and Bob,
10684140	10687140	who found Moomin Mama's handbag without which Moomin Valley
10687140	10689140	would never be the same again.
10690140	10691140	Cheers.
10694140	10697140	Now, I think Moomin would like to say a few words.
10697140	10698140	Moomin.
10698140	10702140	We're very pleased that Mama's handbag is back again.
10702140	10705140	And thank you to our northern friends, Thingamy and Bob.
10705140	10708140	You're seeing as how this is a very special occasion,
10708140	10711140	and also as a thank you for the party they have decided to show us
10711140	10713140	what is in their suitcase,
10713140	10716140	and I'm sure you'll all be astounded by what you see.
10716140	10718140	Come closer, everyone.
10718140	10721140	Now, thingamy and Bob, are you ready?
10725140	10727140	Ready, everyone?
10727140	10728140	Ready, everyone?
10728140	10730140	One, two, three!
10730140	10732140	Ooh!
10734140	10736140	How wonderful!
10736140	10740140	I don't know how the globe could swap that for an old seashell.
10740140	10745140	Oh, I don't know how the globe could swap that for an old seashell.
10747140	10751140	By my, that must be the King's Ruby.
10766140	10769140	The King's Ruby. I found it.
10769140	10771140	It's the Hub Goblin!
10775140	10778140	Yes, this is it. The ruby I've sworn to find.
10780140	10782140	Don't touch it! It's ours!
10782140	10784140	Go away, you nasty Hub Goblin!
10784140	10787140	But that King's ruby belongs only to me!
10787140	10794140	No, it doesn't. The Groke gave it to sing-a-me-in-bob-in-fair exchange for a heart-shaped shell, Mr. Hub Goblin.
10794140	10797140	Did he say a heart-shaped shell?
10797140	10799140	I think so.
10799140	10802140	Anyway, I saw her give it to them with my own eyes.
10802140	10804140	Show it belongs to them, not you.
10804140	10810140	I've spent 300 years day and night searching everywhere for this ruby.
10810140	10813140	Well, that's very sad, but it still is.
10813140	10819140	Now then, let's see, would you exchange the ruby for, say, two diamond mines?
10819140	10822140	No! We don't mind anything else!
10828140	10832140	No, I can't do it. I can't take it by force.
10834140	10837140	It's been so long. What can I do?
10848140	10852140	Would you like some punch? It's very nice.
10853140	10858140	That's very kind of you, woman, mama. I haven't had any for 85 years.
10865140	10867140	Ah, quince.
10867140	10871140	That's part of it, Mr. Hub Goblin. Have some more, please.
10871140	10874140	No, thank you. Hub Goblins don't really drink very much.
10874140	10878140	Well, this is a splendid punch and a splendid party.
10878140	10881140	In return, I shall show you a little magic.
10881140	10884140	I will give out three presents.
10884140	10890140	Now what I can do is grant three wishes, so I want three of you to come forward and make a wish.
10890140	10894140	You're not afraid, are you?
10894140	10899140	How you look old enough not to be frightened, Mr. Emulane?
10899140	10901140	Just let me think.
10901140	10906140	Oh, yes, Mr. Hub Goblin. I broke the spade. I borrowed from woman, papa.
10907140	10910140	No, Mr. Emulane, never make a proper wish.
10910140	10913140	I would like a new spade, if you please.
10913140	10915140	Very well. Here you are.
10915140	10920140	Oh, thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Hub Goblin.
10920140	10922140	Here you are, woman, papa.
10922140	10924140	Right. Who's next?
10924140	10926140	Excuse me?
10928140	10931140	Yes, and what can I do for you, young lady?
10931140	10934140	Well, I'm afraid it might be a little difficult.
10934140	10937140	Huh, for me?
10937140	10939140	Is that really what you want?
10939140	10940140	Please.
10940140	10943140	All right, then close your eyes.
10943140	10948140	Your wish has now come true, young lady.
10948140	10949140	Oh.
10949140	10951140	Oh, snorke-may.
10951140	10953140	Oh, snorke-may done.
10953140	10957140	I've wanted eyes like that wouldn't lay to you think it's so beautiful.
10957140	10960140	Do you think I'm beautiful now, woman?
10960140	10964140	Well, I, well, give me a mirror, someone.
10964140	10967140	They're quite nice, really.
10971140	10973140	Huh?
10973140	10977140	This is horrible, horrible.
10977140	10981140	Please, Mr. Hub Goblin, please give me my eyes back.
10981140	10985140	I'm sorry, but I can only grant one wish per person.
10985140	10989140	Oh, that's really me. No, please.
10989140	10993140	Mr. Hub Goblin, can I make a wish now?
10993140	10998140	Certainly. A golden chariot. A rock crystal goblet. Anything at all.
10998140	11002140	A sack full of gold coins. You can be rich, woman. Really rich.
11002140	11005140	I'm sorry, but movements is the last wish.
11005140	11008140	I know. Why don't you ask for two sackfuls of gold, woman?
11008140	11011140	Then we can have one each. What do you think?
11011140	11014140	No, sniff. I know what I'm going to wish.
11014140	11015140	Oh, man.
11015140	11018140	Mr. Hub Goblin, please change snorke-may done's eyes back to her own.
11018140	11023140	Never mind her, she can see all right. Get the gold coins.
11023140	11027140	The wish is made and fulfilled.
11029140	11031140	There you are. Have a look.
11031140	11032140	Oh.
11032140	11036140	The next time. Think before you make a wish.
11036140	11038140	Momen.
11040140	11042140	Mr. Hub Goblin.
11042140	11044140	Yes, think of me.
11044140	11046140	If you can grant wishes like that,
11046140	11049140	why don't you make a wish for yourself?
11049140	11052140	I'm afraid my magic only works for other people.
11052140	11056140	Mr. Hub Goblin, can we make a wish for you then? Please, there we can.
11056140	11057140	Please.
11057140	11058140	I suppose so.
11058140	11060140	Oh, please. It's important.
11060140	11063140	Very well, as it is not for you.
11063140	11066140	We wish for a movie just like yours.
11066140	11068140	You shall have it.
11069140	11071140	This is for you, Hub Goblin.
11071140	11074140	Oh, thank you. Thank you.
11074140	11080140	And so that was how, after three hundred years, the Hub Goblin search came to an end.
11080140	11085140	And Momen Valley had never had such a celebration.
11085140	11087140	Oh, thank you.
11087140	11088140	Thank you.
11088140	11093140	And so that was how, after three hundred years,
11093140	11099460	Goblin's search came to an end, and Moomin Valley had never had such a celebration.
11099460	11106460	Everyone was happy, except possibly Sniff, who would have quite liked a sack full of gold coins.
11123140	11131140	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.
11131140	11135140	They're always happy and always at play.
11135140	11142140	The Moomin's are having fun day after day. The Moomin's.
11142140	11146140	The Moomin's.
11146140	11153140	They love the laughter and they love the living the Moomin's.
11153140	11161140	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomin's.
11161140	11164140	They're always happy and always at play.
11164140	11171140	The Moomin's are having fun day after day. The Moomin's.
11171140	11178140	The Moomin's.
11178140	11181140	The Moomin's.
11201140	11206140	They are for one and all. The Moomin's are about to call.
11206140	11214140	Come on and sit down here with me. Therefore you are your TV. They are the Moomin's.
11214140	11217140	They are the Moomin's.
11217140	11223140	So come with me, give me your hand. I'll take you up to a Moomin land.
11223140	11231140	You can fly just like a bird. Sing that song ever. There were the Moomin's.
11231140	11234140	There were the Moomin's.
11234140	11237140	There were the Moomin's.
11237140	11240140	There were the Moomin's.
11240140	11243140	There were the Moomin's.
11243140	11246140	There were the Moomin's.
11253140	11258140	There were the Moomin's.
11258140	11263140	There were the Moomin's.
11263140	11268140	There were the Moomin's.
11268140	11273140	There were the Moomin's.
11273140	11279140	There were the Moomin's.
11279140	11289140	There were the Moomin's.
11289140	11295140	There were the Moomin's.
11295140	11304140	There were the Moomin's.
11304140	11308140	Come on, man. We're here already. This is Mum and House.
11311140	11313140	It has been raining since lunchtime,
11313140	11317140	and Mum and his friends had spent all afternoon in Mum and House,
11317140	11319140	waiting for the Sunday to come out.
11322140	11326140	So, Tutiki's arrival was very welcome.
11327140	11330140	Good evening, Mum and Tutiki. Come here.
11330140	11331140	Come in.
11333140	11335140	Mum, don't take his hair.
11335140	11338140	Come on in, Manny. A neat moment.
11341140	11343140	Is there someone with you?
11343140	11345140	Yes, I brought my friend, Manny.
11345140	11346140	Manny?
11346140	11348140	Don't be shy.
11349140	11351140	Well, there's no one there.
11351140	11354140	Yes, there is. You just can't see her.
11354140	11355140	Really?
11355140	11358140	Yes, I'm afraid she's very, very shy.
11359140	11363140	I'll leave the door open for you, Manny. Come in when you're ready.
11363140	11366140	She'll get soaked if she stays out there.
11366140	11370140	Maybe that doesn't matter very much if you're invisible.
11373140	11376140	Tutiki, how nice.
11378140	11381140	What is everyone looking at?
11382140	11386140	A bad Nanny.
11386140	11390140	You know, sometimes when people are very frightened,
11390140	11393140	they can become invisible to the people around them.
11394140	11395140	Poor Nanny.
11395140	11398140	She's looked after by an aunt who doesn't like her,
11398140	11400140	and is really horrible to her,
11400140	11403140	and who only does it because she thinks it's her duty.
11403140	11407140	It wouldn't be so bad if she just got mad and yelled at her,
11407140	11410140	but she's cold and sarcastic, which is much worse.
11410140	11413140	She doesn't care if Nanny is unhappy,
11413140	11415140	and gives her horrible jobs.
11415140	11417140	What's sarcastic?
11417140	11419140	Uh, let's see.
11419140	11421140	Suppose you tripped and fell over.
11421140	11423140	What would Mum and Mama say?
11424140	11426140	Well, she'd ask me if I'd hurt myself.
11426140	11429140	Yes, well, you're lucky that Mum and Mama is so nice,
11429140	11432140	but a lot of people would be mad at you.
11432140	11434140	Now, this nasty old lady would say
11434140	11436140	that maybe you're right dear of dancing,
11436140	11439140	but try not to do it when people are eaten, please.
11439140	11441140	Gosh, that's horrible.
11441140	11445140	Anyway, she just went on being more and more horrible to her,
11445140	11448140	so that in the end, Nanny was so upset.
11448140	11450140	She became invisible,
11450140	11452140	and our aunt said she couldn't be bothered
11452140	11454140	to look after little girl she couldn't see.
11454140	11456140	Poor Nanny.
11457140	11459140	So she asked me to do it.
11459140	11461140	Nanny's still outside.
11461140	11463140	Too nervous to come in.
11465140	11467140	What did you do to this old aunt?
11467140	11470140	I hope you told her she heard Nanny's feelings.
11470140	11473140	She wouldn't have done any good, not with someone like her.
11474140	11476140	So I took Nanny home,
11476140	11478140	and then as you're the nicest family I know,
11478140	11481140	I brought her here so you could make her visible again.
11481140	11484140	You were very flattered, of course, too, Tiki, but...
11484140	11487140	If anyone can do it, you and Mum and Mama can,
11487140	11489140	and Mum can play with her.
11489140	11491140	Does she talk at all to Tiki?
11491140	11492140	I'm afraid not.
11492140	11494140	Not since she became invisible.
11494140	11495140	Oh, dear.
11496140	11498140	I'm sure I can think of lots of games,
11498140	11501140	but it'll be hard to play if I can't see her.
11501140	11503140	She'll be really good at hiding seat, though.
11503140	11505140	Oh, it's okay.
11505140	11509140	You know where she is because her aunt hung a little bell around her neck.
11514140	11516140	Oh, look, the door's opened.
11516140	11518140	That'll be Nanny.
11522140	11524140	Come in, Nanny.
11524140	11527140	All right, don't be frightened.
11527140	11529140	Come and meet everyone.
11529140	11531140	This is your new home,
11531140	11534140	and this is Mum and Mama and Mum and Papa.
11534140	11536140	They're both very nice.
11536140	11539140	Hello, I'm Mum and these are my friends.
11542140	11544140	We were just having some tea.
11544140	11545140	Would you like some?
11545140	11548140	Oh, that is, if you can drink.
11548140	11552140	Oh, perhaps I should make some lemonade.
11553140	11557140	Well, now, perhaps you'd all like to go back to the table.
11557140	11560140	If you'd care to sit down, Nanny.
11564140	11567140	I'm sorry I don't know any more about her,
11567140	11570140	but I'm sure that everything will be okay now she's here.
11570140	11573140	I'm certain it will.
11573140	11575140	We'll do our best, Tiki.
11577140	11579140	Here you are, Nanny.
11583140	11587140	Well, she seems to be okay now,
11587140	11589140	so I'd better be getting along.
11589140	11591140	I've got a lot of things to do.
11591140	11595140	I'll try and come over to see how you're all going.
11595140	11598140	That would really be nice.
11600140	11602140	Oh, that's a better.
11602140	11604140	You have got room, haven't you?
11604140	11607140	Didn't you have someone else stand?
11607140	11612140	Oh, yes, thing I mean Bob, but it's alright, they left last week.
11612140	11614140	That's okay then.
11618140	11621140	Oh, you must have been thirsty.
11621140	11624140	Would you like some more?
11624140	11626140	Sure.
11638140	11642140	Oh, are you coming up with me?
11642140	11645140	That's nice, Nanny.
11653140	11656140	This is your very own room.
11656140	11660140	You'll be warm and cozy here.
11660140	11662140	I've put the lemonade on the table,
11662140	11666140	so you can have a drink whenever you want.
11666140	11670140	Are you sure you wouldn't like something to eat?
11670140	11673140	Ah, I see, you want to go to bed.
11673140	11677140	Well, you had a busy day, so you must be tired out.
11677140	11680140	Don't forget, if you feel frightened or lonely during the night,
11680140	11683140	just come and wake me up and we'll have a talk.
11683140	11686140	If you like, you can tinkle your little bell in my ear,
11686140	11690140	and that should do it, many dear.
11690140	11694140	Sweet dreams, sleep well.
11697140	11699140	She asleep?
11699140	11702140	Yes.
11702140	11706140	I was wondering whether there's anything that might help her
11706140	11709140	in your granny's book of household remedies.
11709140	11712140	I don't know if there's a cure for invisibility.
11712140	11714140	I can't remember, but I'll have a look.
11714140	11716140	There's a remedy for most things.
11716140	11718140	I'm a phone believer in granny's remedy.
11718140	11720140	I know you are dear.
11720140	11722140	I'll go and see.
11722140	11725140	I wonder what you looked like.
11725140	11728140	Hmm.
11728140	11731140	Hmm.
11731140	11734140	Ah, there it is.
11734140	11739140	Now then, a droopy tail, evil eye, melancholy.
11739140	11743140	Ah, this must be it.
11743140	11746140	Ah, this must be it.
11758140	11762140	The prescription was at the end of the book and shakily written,
11762140	11764140	but it looked like the right one.
11764140	11768140	It said, remedy for when people start getting misty
11768140	11771140	and difficult to see.
11771140	11774140	It was very complicated.
11789140	11792140	Do you think it's going to work, Mama?
11792140	11795140	Granny's remedies usually do, so don't worry.
11795140	11797140	Yes, you're right.
11797140	11800140	I wonder whether we ought to go and wake her up.
11817140	11820140	Look, you can see many shoes.
11828140	11831140	Papa!
11831140	11833140	Papa!
11833140	11835140	Good morning, little Mai.
11835140	11837140	Is Ninny up yet?
11837140	11839140	Yes, she is.
11839140	11842140	Where is she? She hasn't eaten yet, has she?
11842140	11845140	I don't know, and she's probably at the dining room.
11845140	11848140	Oh, no!
11854140	11856140	I'm too late!
11856140	11859140	She'd be quiet, you two.
11859140	11862140	Ninny's just finishing her breakfast.
11862140	11865140	Come on, drink it all up.
11865140	11868140	That's good.
11868140	11870140	It should start to work in a couple of hours.
11870140	11872140	Well done, Ninny.
11872140	11874140	Look, her shoes are floating!
11874140	11878140	Yeah, and soon we'll be seeing the rest of her.
11878140	11880140	Ha, they look silly.
11880140	11882140	I think they're very nice feet.
11882140	11884140	I know women, Mama's remedies are good,
11884140	11886140	I can't see them working that fast.
11886140	11890140	Anyway, you must look pretty bad if you want to make yourself invisible.
11890140	11892140	Don't let little Mai upset you, Ninny.
11892140	11894140	It's only the way she talks.
11894140	11896140	She doesn't mean it.
11896140	11898140	Oh, yes, I do.
11898140	11900140	I'm bored, Moomin.
11900140	11902140	Well, what shall we do then, Moomin?
11902140	11904140	I don't know.
11904140	11906140	Let's go mushroom picking.
11906140	11908140	That's boring, I never find any.
11908140	11910140	Well, I do.
11910140	11912140	Would you like to come, Ninny?
11912140	11914140	You can pick the most, shall we?
11914140	11916140	They all look the same to me,
11916140	11920140	so you'll have to tell me which ones are safe to eat.
11922140	11924140	I'll tell you.
11936140	11938140	Papa! Papa!
11938140	11941140	Look, Papa, you can see many shoes now.
11941140	11945140	Oh, that's good. There's not many things Mama's potions won't cure.
11945140	11947140	Oh, it can't be that. She only took it a minute ago.
11947140	11951140	Well, it might be that it works faster if you're completely invisible.
11951140	11953140	I think it's being away from that horrid out.
11953140	11955140	Yes, it could be.
11955140	11959140	Mama, we're taking Ninny mushroom picking.
11959140	11961140	Have a nice time.
11961140	11963140	Morning!
11963140	11965140	Morning!
11965140	11967140	Hello.
11967140	11969140	Where's Ninny?
11971140	11973140	Ah!
11973140	11975140	Ah!
11975140	11977140	Ah!
11977140	11979140	Ah!
11979140	11981140	Wow, what a lot of mushrooms!
11981140	11983140	Ah!
11983140	11985140	Ah!
11985140	11987140	Ah!
11987140	11989140	Ah!
11989140	11991140	Ah!
11991140	11993140	Ah!
11993140	11997140	Wow, what a lot of mushrooms!
11997140	12007140	You seem to know where to find all the best ones, Ninny.
12007140	12011140	It's so fair. I haven't gotten half as many.
12011140	12013140	How are you doing, Momen?
12013140	12015140	Ah!
12015140	12019140	Wow, that must be about four times as many as I've got.
12019140	12021140	Uh, yeah, that's right.
12021140	12025140	You've never picked that many before.
12025140	12029140	You know, Momen, I think there's something fishy about this.
12031140	12034140	Uh-huh, so they're not yours at all.
12034140	12037140	Well, not really, no.
12037140	12040140	Ninny's enjoyed herself.
12040140	12043140	I'd better yak you old ant never let her go mushroom picking.
12043140	12047140	She was probably only allowed to carry the baskets, the really heavy ones.
12047140	12051140	Oh, how awful for her.
12051140	12055140	They're stinky.
12055140	12057140	What's he up to now?
12057140	12059140	I'll take care of him.
12059140	12061140	Hello, Momen, long time no see.
12061140	12063140	Not long enough.
12063140	12065140	Last time you dipped my swimming shorts in glue.
12065140	12068140	You know, I thought that was very funny.
12068140	12071140	Hey, what's that basket floating around up there for?
12071140	12074140	I don't want to be rude, but mind your own business.
12074140	12076140	It looks like the Hobgoblins work.
12076140	12079140	Boy, just think of all the things you could do if you were invisible.
12080140	12082140	Ninny, I'll carry your basket.
12082140	12083140	Let's go.
12083140	12086140	It stinks here.
12086140	12088140	Hey, you.
12088140	12090140	Isn't it me a name or just a description?
12090140	12091140	What's wrong?
12091140	12093140	Is your voice invisible, too?
12093140	12095140	Please stop it, stinky.
12095140	12097140	Can't you see you're frightening her?
12097140	12099140	Oh, it's a girl, is it?
12099140	12100140	Why doesn't she speak for herself?
12100140	12101140	And she's stupid.
12101140	12104140	What a perfect name for her, Ninny.
12104140	12106140	Now look, stinky.
12106140	12108140	Oh, yes, Momen, now look what?
12108140	12112140	You stop upsetting Ninny or I'll get really angry.
12112140	12115140	Without those feet she'd be perfect for a bank robbery.
12115140	12119140	Well, she's getting visible again, so she'll be no good to you at all, stinky.
12119140	12121140	You couldn't see any of her yesterday.
12121140	12123140	Not even the feet.
12123140	12124140	Oh, oh.
12124140	12125140	They're disappearing again.
12125140	12129140	Mom, you have to do a scare of it.
12129140	12132140	Oh, see, she's gone.
12132140	12134140	It's all your fault, stinky.
12134140	12138140	Yes, it's like I told you before she'd make a brilliant bank robbery.
12138140	12140140	Don't you agree?
12140140	12141140	Perfect.
12141140	12145140	Ninny would never do such a thing as that.
12145140	12148140	And anyway, Mom is given her one of Granny's magic remedies.
12148140	12151140	She'll soon be visible again, so they're there.
12159140	12161140	Whose basket is this?
12161140	12163140	Mine in little mice.
12163140	12166140	Well, there's not many of them, but they certainly are pretty.
12166140	12169140	There weren't many left for us to get.
12169140	12171140	Because Ninny has picked them all.
12171140	12175140	It doesn't really matter how many you've got, because you can't eat them.
12175140	12177140	Let me show you.
12177140	12180140	Now, this is deadly, tufted toad stool.
12180140	12182140	And this is cow's vein.
12182140	12185140	You must remember what they look like.
12185140	12188140	Ah, these are movements and sniff I should think.
12188140	12190140	We didn't pick any poisonous ones.
12190140	12193140	Not quite as many as Snork Maiden and Little My,
12193140	12197140	but this is body flybane and insiduous pepper spunk.
12197140	12199140	And you've both got cow's vein, too.
12199140	12201140	You must be more careful.
12201140	12202140	Now, this is better.
12202140	12205140	There's not one mushroom in here that you can't eat.
12205140	12208140	How did Ninny manage to do this all on her own?
12208140	12210140	What a very clever girl she is.
12210140	12212140	Ninny, where are you?
12212140	12214140	Come here a minute.
12214140	12216140	Ninny, didn't you hear?
12216140	12218140	Mama wants you.
12220140	12223140	Ninny, this is a beautiful mushroom basket.
12223140	12226140	We'll have a feast tonight.
12226140	12229140	Her feet have come back.
12229140	12231140	Oh, I'm so glad.
12231140	12234140	We'll soon be able to see your face.
12234140	12236140	It won't take long at all, Ninny.
12236140	12238140	And you mustn't worry about stinky one little bit.
12238140	12240140	He's all talk.
12240140	12243140	If something upsets you, just think of something else.
12243140	12246140	At least that's my philosophy in life.
12247140	12249140	If somebody upsets you, ignore him.
12249140	12251140	That's my philosophy, Ninny.
12251140	12254140	Anyone who picks mushrooms like this deserves to be seen.
12254140	12257140	You mustn't let anything frighten you when you're with us.
12257140	12259140	Do you understand?
12262140	12265140	Come on, everybody's waiting to see you.
12265140	12267140	That's just great, Ninny.
12267140	12269140	Oh, that's wonderful, Ninny, wonderful.
12269140	12272140	I can't wait to see all of you.
12272140	12274140	It won't be long now.
12274140	12277140	I don't think Mouse Gray is quite your color, you know.
12295140	12297140	You just sleep as long as you like, Ninny.
12297140	12298140	Good night now.
12298140	12301140	If you want anything, you just shout.
12304140	12305140	Good night.
12305140	12306140	Good night.
12306140	12307140	Good night.
12307140	12308140	Good night.
12308140	12309140	Good night.
12309140	12310140	Good night.
12310140	12311140	Good night.
12311140	12312140	Good night.
12312140	12313140	Good night.
12313140	12314140	Good night.
12314140	12315140	Good night.
12315140	12316140	Good night.
12316140	12317140	Good night.
12317140	12318140	Good night.
12318140	12319140	Good night.
12319140	12320140	Good night.
12320140	12321140	Good night.
12321140	12331140	Uh...
12331140	12333140	Oh.
12333140	12335140	Oh.
12335140	12336140	Oh.
12336140	12338140	Oh.
12338140	12342140	Oh, where's Mom and Momma?
12342140	12355140	Well, well. What are you doing? Do you know what time it is?
12355140	12361140	Do you like this moment, Papa? Yes, it's very nice.
12361140	12366140	It's good to have someone in the house to make clothes for it last. I hope it'll look pretty on her.
12366140	12369140	What's this for? Her hair!
12372140	12377140	Good morning, Moomin, Papa.
12377140	12379140	Good morning, Lila.
12379140	12382140	I'm coming.
12382140	12385140	I'm coming.
12385140	12387140	I'm coming.
12387140	12390140	I'm coming.
12390140	12393140	I'm coming.
12393140	12396140	I'm coming.
12396140	12400140	Good morning, Papa.
12400140	12402140	Good morning, Moomin, Papa.
12402140	12405140	Good morning, Little Mai. You're very early today. Where's Nini?
12405140	12407140	Still in bed.
12407140	12409140	You're up early.
12409140	12414140	I can't wait to see her. Come on, man.
12418140	12421140	It's like waiting for Christmas, isn't it?
12421140	12425140	Yeah, I like having Christmas every day. Isn't it, Papa?
12425140	12432140	Well, I think it's much more exciting this way. We have to wait until she's ready to come down.
12432140	12438140	Did you hear that door opening? She's awake.
12438140	12443140	I hope she found the dress where I left it on the table.
12456140	12462140	Oh, good. It's all right. Now you know where to look.
12462140	12468140	Well, she's OK, I suppose.
12468140	12473140	Thank you all very much for everything.
12473140	12478140	Oh. So she can talk.
12478140	12485140	They still couldn't see Nini's face, but at least they knew that she was there, and that she was talking to them.
12485140	12487140	It made them all feel a lot better.
12487140	12490140	It made them look.
12490140	12493140	It made them look better.
12493140	12498140	It made them look better.
12498140	12503140	It made them look better.
12503140	12522140	They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.
12522140	12530140	Believing in sharing and caring, and giving the movements.
12530140	12534140	They're always happy and always at play.
12534140	12537140	The movements are having fun day after day.
12537140	12541140	The movements.
12541140	12545140	The movements.
12545140	12552140	They loved the laughter, and they loved the living, the movements.
12552140	12559140	Believing in sharing and caring, and giving the movements.
12559140	12563140	They're always happy and always at play.
12563140	12566140	The movements are having fun day after day.
12566140	12570140	The movements.
12570140	12574140	The movements.
12574140	12579140	The movements.
12589140	12601140	Here they are for one and all.
12601140	12604140	The movements are about to come.
12604140	12607140	Come on and sit down here with me.
12607140	12610140	They're here for you on your TV.
12610140	12613140	They are the movements.
12613140	12616140	They are the movements.
12616140	12619140	Come with me, give me your hand.
12619140	12622140	I'll take you up to a movement land.
12622140	12625140	You can fly just like a bird.
12625140	12627140	Sing that song ever.
12627140	12630140	There were the movements.
12630140	12633140	There were the movements.
12633140	12636140	There were the movements.
12636140	12639140	There were the movements.
12639140	12642140	There were the movements.
12642140	12645140	There were the movements.
12645140	12648140	There were the movements.
12648140	12651140	There were the movements.
12651140	12655140	There were the movements.
12655140	12659140	There were the movements.
12659140	12663140	There were the movements.
12663140	12667140	There were the movements.
12667140	12671140	There were the movements.
12671140	12680140	There were the movements.
12695140	12698140	They can't catch me.
12698140	12700140	Hey, oh, miss me!
12703140	12705140	Hey, where's Danny?
12705140	12709140	I asked her if she wanted to play with us, and she said yes!
12711140	12715140	Danny, come on, we're going to have some fun!
12728140	12730140	Right, let's go!
12733140	12739140	Ninny, who became invisible because of her sarcastic aunt, was now visible up to the neck.
12739140	12744140	But no matter how much of Granny's remedy she took or how nice the movements were to her,
12744140	12747140	her head still remained invisible.
12759140	12761140	That's the invisible child.
12761140	12764140	I wonder what she really looks like.
12764140	12767140	Oh, well, good morning, everybody!
12767140	12771140	Morning, lazy bones! We've been up for hours and hours!
12771140	12773140	We're going to play hide-and-seek in the woods.
12773140	12776140	Great! Ninny, are you all right?
12776140	12778140	Yes, thanks.
12778140	12782140	This is dumb. If I could see your face, I wouldn't have to ask.
12782140	12786140	Doesn't help with you, Sniff. You always ask silly questions.
12789140	12792140	It's a bit big for hide-and-seek, isn't it?
12792140	12794140	But that's what's so good about it!
12795140	12800140	It's a bit big for hide-and-seek, isn't it?
12800140	12803140	But that's what's so good about it!
12815140	12819140	Okay, this is a good place to start, but we've got a new rule for the game.
12820140	12823140	Once you found somewhere to hide, you've got to stay in the same place,
12823140	12825140	no moving about anyone.
12825140	12828140	Do you understand, Ninny?
12828140	12830140	Right, you're to go first, Sniff.
12830140	12832140	Why isn't always me first?
12832140	12834140	We'll have a practice for Ninny's sake.
12834140	12836140	Show her what to do.
12836140	12838140	Uh, hide-and-seek is an easy game.
12838140	12841140	Not for Ninny, it isn't. She's never played it before.
12841140	12843140	What? Never ever?
12843140	12845140	No, and not just hide-and-seek.
12845140	12847140	She hasn't played any games at all.
12847140	12849140	Not even when she was visible?
12849140	12850140	No, nothing.
12850140	12852140	Oh, that's terrible.
12852140	12853140	So, will you go first?
12853140	12855140	No, I won't.
12855140	12857140	Okay, I'll go first then.
12857140	12862140	I'll count to 10 slowly, so you'll have plenty of time to find somewhere.
12862140	12866140	One, two, three.
12869140	12872140	Go on, Ninny, hurry up.
12872140	12876140	Four, five.
12876140	12883140	I can still see you.
12883140	12886140	Six.
12890140	12893140	Seven.
12893140	12895140	Good, good, good.
12895140	12897140	Eight.
12900140	12903140	Nine.
12904140	12907140	Ten.
12907140	12909140	Hello, Ninny.
12909140	12911140	Don't be frightened.
12911140	12913140	Why don't you hide in that bush over there?
12913140	12916140	He'll never find you.
12916140	12918140	I'm coming.
12918140	12921140	Thank you.
12934140	12936140	Ouch, my dear.
12936140	12938140	God, you sniff.
12958140	12961140	Okay.
12964140	12967140	Okay.
12987140	12989140	Got you, Little Mike.
12989140	12991140	No.
12991140	12994140	No, we're Ninny's hiding.
12997140	12999140	Oh, look.
12999140	13002140	Oh.
13005140	13007140	Ah, come out, Ninny.
13007140	13008140	I've got you.
13008140	13011140	That was a good place, but I saw your ribbons.
13011140	13013140	Oh.
13013140	13014140	Now for snort, Maiden.
13014140	13018140	She's always easy to find.
13019140	13021140	Ha.
13021140	13023140	That's only because she wants to be found.
13023140	13025140	Found you, snort, Maiden.
13025140	13028140	One.
13030140	13033140	Two.
13037140	13038140	Three.
13038140	13039140	Don't wait, Ninny.
13039140	13042140	This is my bush.
13042140	13045140	Four.
13049140	13051140	Hey, Ninny.
13051140	13053140	I'll show you a good place.
13053140	13056140	Just come with your uncle stinky.
13066140	13067140	Now, don't worry.
13067140	13068140	No one will find you there.
13068140	13070140	It opens up once you're inside.
13070140	13071140	Come on.
13071140	13072140	It's a bit steep.
13072140	13075140	I'll help you.
13079140	13081140	Oh.
13087140	13088140	Right.
13088140	13090140	That should keep you quiet.
13090140	13092140	You're a bit too visible at the moment.
13092140	13093140	Oh, let me out.
13093140	13097140	But I'm sure if you stay here until tomorrow, no one will see it all.
13097140	13100140	Please don't leave me here.
13100140	13102140	Please.
13109140	13111140	That's it.
13111140	13114140	Now tomorrow, we'll hit the bank.
13122140	13124140	Let me out.
13124140	13126140	Please let me out.
13128140	13132140	I'm very glad I thought of bringing Ninny here.
13132140	13134140	It's nice to have her here too, Tiki.
13134140	13136140	She's no trouble at all.
13136140	13141140	She's all pretty eccentric, and it might be just what she needs to make her want to be seen again.
13141140	13144140	Oh, and you're very kind, of course.
13144140	13145140	Well, thank you.
13145140	13148140	I think I suppose we should be flattered, shouldn't we?
13148140	13150140	Oh, yes, definitely.
13150140	13153140	She started to talk, but her voice is very weak.
13153140	13155140	You have to listen very carefully.
13155140	13158140	Has it always been like that or just since she was invisible?
13158140	13159140	I'm not sure.
13159140	13161140	I don't think it was like that before.
13161140	13166140	Lots of people manage very well without using their heads, so I'm certain Ninny will be all right.
13166140	13170140	Yes, and I'm glad she's got movement in the others to play with.
13170140	13173140	She's never had anybody before, you know.
13173140	13175140	I think she'd find it a bit difficult to Tiki.
13175140	13180140	Well, Mum and Mama, I think that all she needs is something to shock her out of it.
13180140	13182140	Huh, got you a little, Mai.
13182140	13185140	Oh, that bush was too prickly anyway.
13185140	13187140	I expect I'm the last one, hey.
13187140	13189140	No, I haven't found Ninny yet.
13189140	13190140	Ninny?
13190140	13192140	I didn't think Ninny would hide so well.
13192140	13194140	Any luck, Sniff?
13194140	13196140	There's nowhere else to look, Mum and.
13196140	13199140	Perhaps she's lost or fallen or hurt herself.
13199140	13202140	Oh, I've looked absolutely everywhere.
13202140	13204140	I bet she's invisible again.
13204140	13206140	That's why I can't find her.
13206140	13209140	I bet Sniff hasn't looked everywhere.
13209140	13210140	She can't be far.
13210140	13212140	Do you know where she is, Mum and?
13212140	13214140	No, I haven't seen her at all.
13214140	13217140	Not since we started.
13217140	13218140	Ninny!
13218140	13220140	Come on, we're going home.
13220140	13222140	We've finished playing.
13222140	13223140	Ninny!
13223140	13224140	Oh, my goodness.
13224140	13225140	Where could she be?
13225140	13226140	Ninny!
13226140	13227140	It's your turn, Sniff.
13227140	13228140	See, you've got to find her.
13228140	13229140	Ninny!
13229140	13231140	Not once the game's over, I haven't.
13231140	13232140	Never mind.
13232140	13233140	We'll all look.
13233140	13235140	We must find her.
13235140	13238140	We are supposed to be looking after her, you know?
13238140	13241140	Oh, come on.
13241140	13243140	Ninny, the game's over.
13243140	13244140	We've finished.
13244140	13245140	Ninny!
13245140	13246140	Ninny!
13246140	13247140	Hurry up!
13247140	13249140	We're going home for cookies and lemonade!
13249140	13250140	Ninny!
13250140	13251140	Ninny!
13251140	13252140	Ninny!
13252140	13253140	Ninny!
13253140	13254140	Ninny!
13254140	13255140	Ninny!
13255140	13256140	Ninny!
13256140	13257140	Ninny!
13257140	13258140	Ninny!
13258140	13259140	Ninny!
13259140	13260140	Ninny!
13260140	13261140	Ninny!
13261140	13262140	Ninny!
13262140	13263140	Ninny!
13263140	13264140	Ninny!
13264140	13265140	Ninny!
13265140	13266140	Ninny!
13266140	13267140	Ninny!
13267140	13268140	Ninny!
13268140	13269140	Ninny!
13269140	13270140	Ninny!
13270140	13271140	Can you hear us?
13271140	13274140	We weren't supposed to come this far, Snort Maiden.
13274140	13278140	We might be really lost or frightened or anything.
13278140	13279140	Ninny!
13279140	13280140	Where are you, Ninny?
13280140	13282140	Can you hear me?
13282140	13283140	Ninny!
13283140	13284140	Help!
13284140	13286140	I'm over here!
13286140	13289140	Did you hear something?
13289140	13291140	I'm not sure.
13291140	13292140	Help!
13292140	13293140	Help!
13293140	13294140	I'm here!
13294140	13295140	Help!
13295140	13297140	That's her!
13297140	13299140	She's not far away!
13299140	13300140	Ninny!
13300140	13301140	Where are you?
13301140	13302140	Here!
13302140	13304140	Behind this rock!
13304140	13306140	Where's her voice coming from?
13306140	13308140	That way, I think.
13308140	13309140	Ninny!
13309140	13311140	I can't hear what you're saying!
13311140	13313140	Try and shout a bit louder!
13313140	13315140	I'm over here!
13315140	13316140	Over here!
13316140	13318140	Behind the rock!
13318140	13320140	I still can't hear properly!
13320140	13322140	Louder than any louder!
13322140	13324140	Behind the rock!
13324140	13326140	Which rock?
13326140	13327140	Over here!
13327140	13329140	The big rock!
13330140	13333140	Over there!
13333140	13338140	I've never shouted so much in my life!
13338140	13339140	Ninny!
13339140	13340140	Ninny!
13340140	13342140	Are you behind this rock, Ninny?
13342140	13343140	Yes!
13343140	13345140	Stinky block the cave with it!
13345140	13346140	Don't worry!
13346140	13347140	We'll get you out!
13347140	13348140	Hang on!
13356140	13357140	Are you alright, Ninny?
13357140	13359140	Thank you, Mum!
13359140	13362140	Oh, thank you!
13362140	13364140	Your voice seems to be...
13364140	13365140	Oh, what?
13365140	13367140	Oh, nothing!
13367140	13370140	Try and hold on to me, and I'll call you out!
13370140	13372140	Oh, thank you!
13377140	13378140	Hey!
13378140	13380140	What's happened?
13380140	13381140	Where's your finder?
13381140	13382140	In the cave!
13382140	13383140	Wow!
13383140	13385140	What a brilliant hiding place had you find it!
13385140	13388140	What's wrong?
13388140	13390140	Did I say something funny?
13393140	13395140	Now, that was very mean of Stinky's.
13395140	13398140	A clever idea, though, of interuser for a van robbery.
13398140	13399140	Oh, Papa!
13399140	13401140	Oh, I know Stinky shouldn't have done it,
13401140	13405140	and it must have been a nasty shopping trapped in the dark in that cave,
13405140	13408140	but no real harm came to her, and she didn't disappear,
13408140	13410140	and her voice got much stronger.
13410140	13412140	Because she yelled so loud!
13412140	13415140	Oh, goodness! Did you, dear?
13415140	13417140	Yes, Mum and Mama!
13417140	13421140	Mum and told me to yell loudly, so he'd know where I was!
13421140	13423140	And it was loud, too!
13423140	13424140	Good for you, Ninny.
13424140	13427140	It's surprising the things you can do if you have to,
13427140	13432140	and you ought to remember that people who speak loudly are usually very noticeable.
13432140	13435140	Go on, yo! I want to see it!
13435140	13437140	That's a good idea, Ninny.
13437140	13439140	If shouting brought back your voice,
13439140	13441140	you never know it might be just what's needed to make the rest of you visible.
13441140	13443140	Try and get angry, as well.
13443140	13446140	Yeah, that's easy. Just think about Stinky.
13446140	13448140	Yeah, and how horrible he is!
13448140	13451140	That should make you angry. Very angry!
13454140	13456140	Just your white Stinky!
13456140	13458140	I care how fast it may be!
13461140	13464140	Stinky, wait! We want to talk to you!
13464140	13465140	I don't want to talk to you!
13465140	13466140	No!
13468140	13470140	Oh, you are right, Sniff!
13471140	13474140	You can't get away, Stinky.
13475140	13478140	The forest is my home ground! You won't catch me in here!
13478140	13479140	Ah!
13484140	13486140	I did it!
13486140	13488140	Hold it.
13494140	13496140	You can't do this to me!
13496140	13498140	We're only doing what you did to Ninny!
13498140	13502140	Now look, I needed her to help me! I did, I tell ya!
13502140	13504140	But she didn't want to, huh?
13504140	13508140	That's why I put her down this hole to change her mind!
13508140	13512140	And scare her so much that she'd become totally invisible again!
13512140	13516140	She had to be invisible for my plan! Now get me out of here!
13516140	13518140	It's all right, Stinky. See you tomorrow!
13518140	13520140	No! Good!
13523140	13525140	You crushed few things!
13525140	13528140	I had such a wonderful plan!
13528140	13532140	Ah! Ah! You're spiteful!
13532140	13535140	Oh, let's hear them my next job!
13535140	13540140	But despite all that had happened, Ninny's face was still not to be seen.
13542140	13545140	Then, about ten days later.
13555140	13558140	This weather seems to push the nails out.
13560140	13564140	I haven't seen anyone stare at the sea like Ninny does.
13564140	13567140	Well, maybe she's never seen it before!
13571140	13574140	Oh, she's crying now!
13586140	13590140	What's the matter?
13590140	13594140	It's the sea! It's far too big!
13595140	13598140	You don't have to go on it, you know.
13599140	13602140	Mama! Mama! What's up?
13606140	13608140	What's the matter with her?
13608140	13613140	Nothing to worry about. She's never seen the sea before and she's just surprised at how big it is.
13616140	13620140	Well, there's an awful lot of water, that's for sure.
13626140	13630140	Ninny's lucky. I wish there was something to surprise or excite me.
13630140	13633140	Nothing's happened for weeks. Anything would be nice.
13633140	13635140	Mama must be bored.
13635140	13637140	I think you're right.
13637140	13639140	But she never gets bored.
13639140	13641140	Well, she is now. She needs something to happen.
13641140	13644140	I think we should do something to surprise her.
13644140	13646140	Like what?
13646140	13648140	Well, I know what we can do.
13648140	13649140	Well, tell me.
13649140	13652140	We'll creep up behind her and just give her a little push.
13652140	13655140	What, Papa? Push her into the sea?
13655140	13658140	Oh, Papa, you can't. Mama wouldn't like it.
13658140	13659140	Just watch me.
13659140	13662140	But the water's freezing. A mama will get all wet.
13662140	13665140	We never found the water too cold when we were your age.
13665140	13667140	You young people today have no sense of fun.
13667140	13669140	Did you really used to do things like that?
13669140	13671140	All the time.
13671140	13672140	Papa?
13672140	13673140	Yes, Mum.
13673140	13674140	Oh, nothing.
13674140	13676140	Don't worry, Mum.
13676140	13679140	Mama enjoys a prank. She'll find it very funny. I promise.
13699140	13701140	I know you don't.
13701140	13706140	No, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
13706140	13709140	Don't you dare push her into that big horrible sea?
13709140	13710140	Let me explain to me.
13710140	13713140	There's nothing to explain. You're a big bully.
13713140	13715140	She didn't go all wet.
13715140	13717140	What a nasty trick.
13717140	13719140	You could never...
13719140	13721140	Never.
13721140	13723140	Mummy, she didn't go all wet.
13723140	13725140	What a nasty trick.
13725140	13726140	You could never...
13726140	13728140	Never.
13739140	13740140	Mimi.
13744140	13746140	There's your face, hurry!
13746140	13747140	Hurry!
13747140	13748140	Hurry!
13748140	13752140	That's the last thing to see you.
13752140	13757140	What on earth happened? Were you up to something?
13757140	13763140	Oh, nothing much. You know, that child has got the sharpest teeth with the without our head.
13763140	13768140	A woman, a woman at last. I'm visible again. We're always you won't disappear again.
13768140	13770140	Never, I'll never.
13770140	13774140	Brave girl, and with a good strong set of healthy teeth, too.
13774140	13776140	Oh, I'm so happy, nanny.
13776140	13778140	Mimi dear.
13778140	13782140	I'm very glad, too.
13786140	13788140	Oh.
13788140	13790140	Oh.
13790140	13792140	Oh.
13792140	13794140	Uh.
13794140	13796140	Oh.
13796140	13798140	Oh.
13798140	13800140	Oh.
13800140	13802140	Oh.
13802140	13804140	Uh.
13804140	13806140	Uh.
13806140	13810140	Stop laughing, you horrible child. You use sartuth monster.
13810140	13818140	What's so funny, huh?
13818140	13820140	Oh.
13820140	13822140	Oh.
13822140	13824140	Oh.
13824140	13826140	Oh.
13838140	13840140	Really, nanny laughed.
13840140	13843140	Well, she certainly changed, momma.
13843140	13847140	All she needed was to get angry, and she did.
13847140	13852140	I hope movement pop is forgiven, nanny. Thank you all for taking such good care of her.
13852140	13856140	I hate to say it, but she sounds almost as bad as it'll mind now.
13856140	13859140	Tiki, nanny.
13865140	13868140	And so nanny left movement house with Tiki.
13868140	13874140	Now that she was completely visible and far from timid, she was ready for anything.
13874140	13879140	Anything that is except seeing her aunt, she said.
13879140	13881140	Nanny.
13881140	13884140	Nanny.
13884140	13886140	Nanny.
13886140	13889140	Nanny.

13898140	13900140	Nanny.
13900140	13903140	Nanny.
13913140	13920140	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
13920140	13927140	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
13927140	13931140	They're always happy and always at play.
13931140	13934140	The movements are having fun day after day.
13934140	13938140	The movements.
13938140	13942140	The movements.
13942140	13949140	They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.
13949140	13956140	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
13956140	13960140	They're always happy and always at play.
13960140	13964140	The movements are having fun day after day.
13964140	13967140	The movements.
13967140	13971140	The movements.
13971140	13977140	The movements.
13986140	13996140	The movements.
13996140	13999140	Here they are for one and all.
13999140	14002140	The movements are about to come.
14002140	14005140	Come on and sit down here with me.
14005140	14007140	Therefore you are your TV.
14007140	14010140	They are the movements.
14010140	14013140	They are the movements.
14013140	14017140	So come with me, give me your hand.
14017140	14020140	I'll take you up to a movement land.
14020140	14023140	You can fly just like a bird.
14023140	14025140	Sing that song ever.
14025140	14028140	There were the movements.
14028140	14031140	There were the movements.
14031140	14034140	There were the movements.
14034140	14037140	There were the movements.
14037140	14040140	There were the movements.
14040140	14043140	The movements.
14070140	14073140	The movements.
14073140	14076140	The movements.
14076140	14080140	The movements.
14080140	14083140	The movements.
14083140	14087140	The movements.
14087140	14090140	The movements.
14090140	14093140	Snort Maiden is running as if the groke is chasing her.
14093140	14097140	I don't think I've ever seen her run so fast.
14097140	14099140	Ah.
14099140	14102140	Ah.
14102140	14103140	Ah.
14103140	14105140	I wonder what's the matter?
14105140	14110140	Perhaps something terrible has happened.
14114140	14116140	Maiden!
14116140	14117140	Maiden!
14117140	14120140	Maiden Papa!
14120140	14121140	Maiden Mama!
14121140	14124140	No!
14124140	14127840	Come down and tell us what's wrong.
14127840	14130940	My brother's on the cliff, and he's about to jump off.
14130940	14132040	What snorke?
14132040	14133140	Are you sure?
14133140	14135340	He says nothing will prevent him doing it.
14135340	14136140	Oh, please.
14136140	14138240	You must stop him, moment.
14138240	14140720	Did you say that you wanted me to help you with something
14140720	14141840	snorkemaiden?
14141840	14142340	Yes.
14142340	14145340	I want you to stop snorke jumping off the south side of the cliff.
14145340	14146140	Oh, dear.
14146140	14147840	I never thought he was the type.
14147840	14150140	He says it's a test flight.
14150140	14150940	Oh.
14150940	14152340	Now what?
14152340	14154140	A test flight, did you say?
14154140	14157140	Snorkemaiden, do you mean that he's finally finished building
14157140	14158940	his flying ship?
14158940	14160540	No, only the blueprint.
14160540	14161840	At least I think that's all.
14161840	14163140	He doesn't tell me.
14163140	14165540	Well, that's a start.
14165540	14168040	He built a small model of the flying ship's wings,
14168040	14171040	and they don't look strong enough to carry anyone.
14171040	14172840	And now he's going to try them out himself
14172840	14173940	to see if they'll work.
14173940	14175040	And I know they won't.
14175040	14176440	They'll break, you know.
14176440	14178740	Now, wait a minute, snorkemaiden.
14178740	14180340	Slow down and let me think.
14180340	14183340	He's made the wings from the blueprint of the flying ship.
14183340	14185840	Well, his plans are always very accurate.
14185840	14187840	Oh, Papa, you've got to stop him.
14187840	14190640	The south side, Papa.
14190640	14191940	Yes, I know.
14191940	14194140	The highest and steepest one of all.
14194140	14195140	Oh, moment, Papa.
14195140	14197540	There must be something we can do.
14197540	14199140	Yes, I'm sure there is.
14199140	14199640	Right.
14199640	14200440	Hurry, everybody.
14200440	14201740	There's no time to lose.
14201740	14202740	Come on.
14202740	14204740	Oh, thank you, moment, Papa.
14210340	14224340	Come on.
14224340	14237740	All right.
14237740	14240740	Oh, my God!
14240740	14243740	Oh, my God!
14247740	14249740	A snork? Wait!
14249740	14251740	Wait, please!
14251740	14254740	Stop, snork! Don't do it!
14255740	14258740	Why have you brought everybody here, snork maiden?
14258740	14260740	They've come to beg you not to do it!
14260740	14262740	You're too young and brilliant for such a tragic end!
14262740	14264740	Thank the bobble we were in time!
14264740	14267740	As a matter of fact, you weren't.
14267740	14268740	Oh, really?
14268740	14271740	It looks very dangerous to me, snork.
14271740	14273740	Well, it's not a tall woman, Papa.
14273740	14276740	I made these wings myself. They're perfectly balanced.
14276740	14279740	Well, yes, I'm sure they are.
14279740	14283740	The blueprints are detailed and precise. They're quite safe.
14283740	14288740	Tell me, snork. Why did you stop on the edge like that after running down the slope?
14288740	14291740	I was measuring the right length for my approach run.
14292740	14295740	Don't do it, snork. I don't want to lose my only brother.
14295740	14297740	Don't make such a fuss, snork maiden.
14297740	14299740	Do you really think it's safe?
14299740	14303740	Of course it is. You don't see birds falling out of the sky, do you?
14303740	14309740	Well, at least, do your test flight just above the ground so that if something happens to go wrong, you won't hurt yourself.
14309740	14314740	I've already done that from the roof of our house, and it worked beautifully.
14314740	14315740	Did you see him?
14315740	14317740	No, I didn't see anything.
14317740	14320740	Of course you didn't. Do you think I let a wimpy little sister watch me?
14321740	14323740	What's that supposed to mean, snork?
14323740	14327740	Just that I don't want you sticking your big nose into my affairs all the time.
14327740	14329740	I don't like it, and there's nothing to do with you.
14329740	14332740	Yours is just as big, and I don't want to lose you.
14332740	14334740	Don't go on about losing me.
14334740	14335740	Why not?
14335740	14337740	Come on now, you two. Stop it.
14337740	14338740	Hey!
14338740	14340740	Oops! That was close.
14340740	14343740	Snork maiden, I don't think your brother is going to be stopped.
14343740	14345740	Oh dear, oh dear.
14345740	14347740	You're very brave, snork.
14350740	14353740	Right, here we go.
14353740	14357740	This time it'll be a perfect takeoff.
14357740	14359740	It's a long way.
14359740	14361740	Oh look, isn't that snuffkin down there?
14361740	14364740	Where? Where is he? Where's snuffkin?
14364740	14367740	You can't see him from there, Sniff. You'll have to come here.
14367740	14369740	Is it really snuffkin?
14369740	14373740	Yes, I'm sure it is. Snuffkin!
14373740	14375740	Yeah!
14375740	14377740	Baby, hear you?
14377740	14379740	No, I don't think so.
14379740	14381740	All right, here goes!
14381740	14383740	Good luck, Snork!
14400740	14402740	He's flying!
14409740	14411740	Oh!
14422740	14424740	It's the snork!
14440740	14442740	Hey!
14445740	14447740	Look at him flying!
14447740	14449740	It's all right, Snork maiden.
14449740	14452740	Your brother's doing fine. Come and see.
14454740	14457740	He's done it! He's done it!
14457740	14460740	Whoa, I knew he could do it.
14460740	14462740	Well, so did I, to be honest.
14462740	14463740	Huh?
14463740	14465740	You, Snork!
14469740	14472740	Hello!
14472740	14475740	Hey! Hey!
14475740	14476740	Hey!
14476740	14480740	I remember this test flight is a great success!
14500740	14504740	Just as I thought he can't fly and wave at the same time.
14504740	14507740	Interesting!
14507740	14509740	That was mean, stinky.
14509740	14512740	If I could get him to wave with both arms, he'd probably fall.
14512740	14517740	Look, we don't want you here, stinky. Why don't you just go away?
14517740	14520740	I can find lots to do with that machine.
14520740	14523740	If you won't go away, I will.
14523740	14528740	Well, go on, Snuffkin. What do I care what you do?
14528740	14532740	Hmm, that would be perfect for robberies.
14532740	14535740	The wind seems to be taking him out to sea.
14535740	14538740	Why doesn't he turn around and come back?
14538740	14541740	Turning in that thing might not be so easy.
14541740	14543740	What? Do you mean he can't?
14543740	14546740	Well, don't worry, Snork maiden. Of course he can.
14546740	14551740	Oh, what's this I can't turn on?
14552740	14553740	Oh!
14561740	14563740	Oh, he's hit a tree.
14563740	14565740	Come on, hurry!
14582740	14584740	No!
14587740	14589740	Is he dead?
14589740	14591740	No, he's been knocked out.
14591740	14593740	He looks dead to me anyway.
14593740	14595740	Where are they? What's happened to the wings?
14595740	14597740	In the tree.
14597740	14600740	Ah, he won't want them anymore, so now I can have them.
14600740	14603740	Now, let me see.
14612740	14614740	So, did the test fly go all right?
14614740	14617740	Will someone tell me what happened?
14617740	14621740	Well, it was fine until the very end.
14621740	14624740	I'm sure that you only need a bit more practice.
14624740	14627740	Flying isn't the easiest thing to master, you know.
14627740	14631740	I expect so. Let's hope you don't run out of bandages, though.
14631740	14633740	Excuse me.
14633740	14635740	Snork?
14635740	14637740	Are you going to use the wings anymore?
14637740	14639740	I might not. Why?
14639740	14642740	Oh, well, I'll have them if you don't want them.
14642740	14644740	I want to fly in the sky, too.
14644740	14646740	It looks the most exciting thing I've ever seen.
14646740	14648740	Oh, please let me have them.
14648740	14651740	Well, it's not as simple as that, movement.
14651740	14654740	They need testing before the design changes.
14654740	14657740	I'm not going to use the wings anymore.
14657740	14660740	Well, I'll have them if you don't want them.
14661740	14664740	They need testing before the design is complete.
14664740	14667740	But I could do that, Snork. I know I could do it.
14667740	14669740	Please let me have them.
14669740	14671740	Well, I suppose I could do with some help.
14671740	14674740	There's a lot to do, fetching and carrying mostly.
14674740	14677740	You haven't said if I can have the wings or not yet, Snork.
14677740	14679740	Yes, you can, but on one condition.
14679740	14681740	Anything.
14681740	14685740	Well, now the blueprints are finished and the wings are more or less right.
14685740	14689740	I'll need somewhere to build the ship and somewhere to store all the materials
14689740	14691740	so they'll be dry and at hand.
14691740	14694740	Yes, you will, Snork. I can see that.
14694740	14698740	It doesn't have to be much, just a roof will do, or and walls.
14698740	14701740	So that people can't spy on me and steal my ideas.
14701740	14704740	I can do the building myself, but I'll need some help
14704740	14706740	and when it's finished, you can have the wings.
14706740	14708740	Great. I'd love to help you.
14708740	14711740	I'd have done that anyway, but now that I can have the wings,
14711740	14714740	I'll work twice as hard. You won't regret it, Snork.
14714740	14716740	I promise you you won't.
14716740	14719740	Splendid, woman. That settled them.
14719740	14721740	Perhaps we can get more help.
14721740	14724740	I'm sure that'd be easy. How about it, Snork?
14724740	14726740	Yes, of course.
14726740	14728740	Will you help us do Sniff?
14728740	14730740	Yes, but I want something too.
14730740	14733740	I'll let you borrow the wings.
14733740	14737740	No, I'm far too heavy. I only break them.
14737740	14741740	Don't worry, Sniff. I'm sure I'll think of something you can have.
14741740	14744740	Oh, as long as it's something nice.
14744740	14746740	How I do love helping people.
14746740	14750740	You're all hard, Sniff. We know that for sure.
14753740	14757740	I'm sure you'll need some expert help with the shed, Snork.
14768740	14770740	Surely this must be deep enough, Papa?
14770740	14774740	Oh, no. We moments are always built for posterity.
14774740	14777740	Besides, I like pouring cement.
14777740	14779740	Okay, Papa.
14794740	14797740	I've given your present a lot of fortune, all.
14797740	14798740	Huh?
14798740	14802740	And I think I'll give you one of my invaluable books on machinery.
14802740	14805740	Oh, don't you want it?
14805740	14809740	Well, if there was something else, I'm not much of a reader.
14809740	14813740	What about my invaluable fountain pen?
14813740	14815740	Invaluable fountain pen?
14815740	14817740	What about my invaluable...
14817740	14820740	Do you have anything that's not invaluable, Snork?
14820740	14823740	Well, what about a gold coin?
14823740	14826740	Well, that sounds great. A real gold coin?
14826740	14829740	Oh, boy, yes, that's a deal.
14849740	14852740	You are digging a very deep hole.
14852740	14855740	Oh, why don't you stop and have some sandwiches?
14855740	14858740	Should we do that, Papa? Go on.
14858740	14860740	Yes, I think we can stop now.
14860740	14862740	Sniff and your brother are in the woods.
14862740	14864740	Yes, I know. I heard them.
14871740	14873740	Hi, Snork, maybe.
14875740	14877740	Oh, no.
14877740	14880740	Wait a minute. I want to ask you something.
14880740	14881740	What is it?
14881740	14885740	Tell me, Snork, is it true that your brother gave those wings to a woman?
14885740	14890740	Yes, it is. He's helping Snork to build the shed his payment.
14890740	14894740	I thought they'd been broken up. They hit that tree very hard.
14894740	14896740	Well, my brother's repairing them.
14896740	14899740	Will you let me pass? I've got to take his lunch to him.
14899740	14902740	And will he be able to repair them?
14902740	14905740	He can repair anything.
14906740	14907740	Mmm.
14907740	14910740	Gosh, what a lot of wood you've got.
14910740	14914740	Well, the shed has to be a lot bigger than my flying ship.
14914740	14917740	Moomin and Moomin Papa are digging holes. They sure are deep.
14917740	14922740	Everybody's being very kind, very kind indeed.
14924740	14928740	Mama's cooking and Snuffkin's gone to get nails.
14928740	14931740	There are some other things I need him to get as well.
14931740	14933740	Will you write them down?
14934740	14937740	Of course I will, Snork. Oh, you're such a planner.
14937740	14941740	Well, I'm afraid all famous inventors have to be.
14951740	14953740	Whether it was Snork's planning,
14953740	14957740	or the fact that everyone in Moomin Valley helped in some way or other,
14957740	14961740	the hanger or boat house was finished in a record time.
14963740	14965740	I'm going to take a look.
14965740	14967740	I'm going to take a look.
14967740	14969740	I'm going to take a look.
14969740	14971740	I'm going to take a look.
14971740	14973740	I'm going to take a look.
14973740	14975740	I'm going to take a look.
14975740	14977740	I'm going to take a look.
14977740	14979740	I'm going to take a look.
14979740	14981740	I'm going to take a look.
14981740	14983740	I'm going to take a look.
14983740	14985740	I'm going to take a look.
14985740	14987740	I'm going to take a look.
14987740	14989740	I'm going to take a look.
14989740	14991740	I'm going to take a look.
14991740	14993740	I'm going to take a look.
14993740	14995740	I'm going to take a look.
14995740	14997740	I'm going to take a look.
14997740	14999740	I'm going to take a look.
14999740	15001740	I'm going to take a look.
15001740	15003740	I'm going to take a look.
15003740	15005740	I'm going to take a look.
15005740	15007740	You?
15007740	15009740	Moomin's here.
15009740	15011740	Come in, Moomin.
15011740	15013740	Thank you for all your help.
15013740	15017740	You did so much that these wings are hardly paymented enough.
15017740	15019740	But if you're happy with them.
15019740	15021740	You make fun building the shed.
15021740	15025740	I change the design a bit, so it's easier to take off on land.
15025740	15029740	And turning shouldn't be a problem anymore.
15029740	15031740	You must remember to give yourself plenty of time, Moomin.
15031740	15033740	Thank you, Snork.
15033740	15035740	I can't wait to try them out.
15035740	15037740	I'm so excited I don't think I'll sleep tonight.
15037740	15039740	Are you trying them out tomorrow?
15039740	15041740	As soon as I can.
15041740	15043740	You will be careful.
15043740	15045740	You must practice a lot just above the ground to get used to
15045740	15047740	wearing them before you try to go too high.
15047740	15050360	I don't want anything to happen to you.
15050360	15052200	Oh, practice, I promise.
15058200	15060120	Where are you going to practice tomorrow?
15060120	15061520	I haven't decided.
15064840	15067320	I'll find somewhere when I come out tomorrow,
15067320	15069880	perhaps on that small hill near the cliff.
15069880	15071720	Well, that can't be too dangerous.
15071720	15072720	I'll see you there.
15107740	15117740	Hi, Momen. Where do you put the wings?
15117740	15129740	On the table outside, you must have gone past them
15129740	15131740	if you came in through the veranda door.
15131740	15135740	No, I didn't. They're not there.
15135740	15137740	What?
15141740	15145740	Oh, no, you're right. They're gone.
15145740	15147740	Oh dear, I thought it was mine.
15147740	15149740	What's happened to them?
15149740	15150740	Somebody stolen them.
15150740	15152740	What's the matter with you, too?
15152740	15153740	Is something wrong?
15153740	15156740	Yes, somebody stolen Momen's wings.
15156740	15159740	Well, perhaps they haven't been stolen.
15159740	15163740	Of course they have, and I bet I know who did it, too.
15163740	15164740	Come on.
15164740	15167740	Where are we going? Do you know where they are?
15175740	15176740	It's stinky.
15176740	15180740	Oh, yeah. Well, it certainly didn't take you long.
15180740	15183740	Just a minute, stinky. Those are my wings.
15183740	15185740	See? I knew it was him.
15189740	15191740	Stop, you horrible creature.
15191740	15193740	I certainly will back.
15193740	15196740	If you give them back, stinky, I'll let you try them out later.
15196740	15197740	I promise.
15197740	15202740	No way, boom. When they're mine now, I'm going to be a high flier.
15202740	15204740	Look out, moving.
15207740	15208740	Oh, stop!
15208740	15210740	Oh, no.
15210740	15213740	You're pathetic.
15213740	15215740	The wings are mine.
15215740	15218740	I'll become a master criminal now.
15219740	15222740	All rotten seabing.
15222740	15225740	You shouldn't have left them outside, Momen.
15225740	15228740	Yeah, but who'd think let each steal them?
15228740	15229740	Where his friends?
15229740	15230740	Well, almost.
15230740	15233740	I didn't think even stinky would do something like that.
15233740	15234740	Well, he did, didn't he?
15234740	15236740	Now, don't worry, Momen.
15236740	15239740	We'll find him and get them back. I know it.
15245740	15247740	Look, Momen, now he's going towards the sea.
15249740	15253740	Oh, no, turn around.
15253740	15255740	But stinky didn't know how to maneuver the wings.
15255740	15258740	It must take him further and further out.
15261740	15264740	Turn around, we'll get turned back.
15264740	15265740	Until?
15273740	15275740	You're at least he's having a bath for once.
15275740	15277740	The wings will be badly damaged.
15278740	15279740	Never mind.
15279740	15281740	Snark will build another pair.
15281740	15283740	I sure hope so.
15308740	15314740	They love the laughter and they love the living.
15314740	15317740	The movements.
15317740	15325740	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
15325740	15328740	They're always happy and always at play.
15328740	15332740	The movements are having fun day after day.
15332740	15335740	The movements.
15336740	15340740	The movements.
15340740	15343740	They love the laughter and they love the living.
15343740	15347740	The movements.
15347740	15354740	Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
15354740	15358740	They're always happy and always at play.
15358740	15362740	The movements are having fun day after day.
15362740	15365740	The movements.
15365740	15369740	The movements.
15369740	15375740	The movements.
15393740	15397740	Here they are for one and all.
15397740	15400740	The movements are about to come.
15400740	15403740	Come on and sit down here with me.
15403740	15405740	Therefore you are your TV.
15405740	15408740	They are the movements.
15408740	15411740	They are the movements.
15411740	15414740	So come with me, give me your hand.
15414740	15417740	I'll take you up to a movement land.
15417740	15420740	You can fly just like a bird.
15420740	15423740	Sing the best song ever.
15423740	15426740	There were the movements.
15426740	15429740	There were the movements.
15429740	15432740	There were the movements.
15432740	15435740	There were the movements.
15435740	15438740	There were the movements.
15438740	15441740	There were the movements.
15450740	15453740	There were the movements.
15453740	15456740	There were the movements.
15456740	15459740	There were the movements.
15459740	15462740	There were the movements.
15462740	15465740	There were the movements.
15465740	15468740	There were the movements.
15468740	15471740	There were the movements.
15471740	15474740	There were the movements.
15474740	15477740	There were the movements.
15477740	15481740	There were the movements.
15481740	15486740	Captain Blood and his band of feared pirates had sailed the seas for many years,
15486740	15489740	but never could he remember a storm such as this.
15489740	15495740	He began to wonder whether his ship could withstand the battering and buffeting of the angry waves for much longer.
15495740	15501740	Alas, he is now too late to launch the lifeboat, he thought, as he lashed himself to the wheel.
15501740	15504740	His voice rose against the wind.
15504740	15510740	The blood can think of no better death than to journey to the bottom of the sea, losing the last battle against his old adversary.
15510740	15514740	But if only I could see the life of the young and beautiful princess,
15514740	15517740	who I rescued from the Duke scallion before a ciker.
15517740	15521740	I care not about the three chests of doubloons, two chests of jewels,
15521740	15525740	and 36 bales of the richest and most colorful silks.
15525740	15529740	But oh, must she too perish in this terrible storm.
15529740	15531740	Did a good book, Moomin?
15531740	15534740	Mmm, it's great.
15534740	15537740	What a terrible storm, it's not easing at all.
15537740	15538740	No.
15538740	15541740	I'm so glad I'm not on my own in a night like this.
15541740	15544740	I feel safe in Moomin house.
15544740	15546740	Oh, what was that?
15546740	15549740	It sounded like a tree breaking.
15549740	15550740	Hey, Moomin.
15550740	15553740	Mmm, why don't you read your story out loud?
15553740	15554740	Oh, okay.
15554740	15556740	But can I start where I got to?
15556740	15559740	As long as you tell us what's happened before, we won't know what it's about.
15559740	15561740	And we might have missed something important.
15561740	15563740	Just the main points will do, Moomin.
15563740	15565740	Well, there's this brave part.
15565740	15567740	Oh, it's so much fun when someone reads out loud.
15567740	15569740	Go on, Moomin.
15569740	15570740	Captain Blood.
15570740	15574740	And he and his men have captured a rich and royal galleon.
15574740	15578740	They've taken lots of gold, silver, and jewels and things.
15578740	15580740	And oh, yes, a princess, too.
15580740	15582740	It's exciting, isn't it?
15582740	15584740	Yes, it is.
15585740	15591740	The storm that rose that night was so violent that at first,
15591740	15596740	it seemed inevitable the ship found before the waves had engulfed it.
15596740	15599740	Not bad, if I say so myself.
15599740	15603740	Captain Blood saw that the poor princess had indeed swooned.
15603740	15609740	With only the rats for company, how frightened she must have been down in the old.
15609740	15613740	The noise of the storm was deafening as the ship was thrown above.
15614740	15616740	Under swirling sea.
15616740	15619740	The captain's brave heart went out to his young and beautiful captain.
15619740	15621740	Would I have some tea, Mama?
15621740	15623740	Of course, dear. Would you like me to bring it up to you?
15623740	15625740	No, thanks. I've finished for the day.
15625740	15628740	That's good. Shall we all have some tea and lemonade?
15628740	15631740	Yes, please. I'm very thirsty.
15631740	15633740	You read very well. Thank you, Moomin.
15633740	15635740	Great story, isn't it?
15635740	15637740	Could I have some strawberry juice, please, Mama?
15637740	15640740	It's not made, and when is your brother coming home?
15640740	15644740	He didn't say exactly, but in a couple of days, I should think.
15644740	15649740	It was a good idea to let snort-making stay while he was away, wasn't it, Papa?
15649740	15655740	Yes, it wouldn't be very nice to be all on your own at night in a storm like this.
15655740	15657740	Not at all.
15671740	15673740	She seems to be sinking.
15673740	15675740	She won't be able to hold out much longer.
15675740	15678740	We must get to the crew without delay.
15678740	15680740	How could we launch a boat in this weather?
15680740	15682740	Any survivors?
15682740	15685740	We haven't found anyone yet.
15685740	15688740	So what about further along the coast?
15688740	15690740	Any reports of survivors turning up?
15690740	15693740	No, I'm afraid not, Inspector. We haven't heard anything.
15693740	15695740	Well, tell me if you do.
15695740	15697740	Ah, Inspector.
15697740	15698740	Yes?
15698740	15701740	Ah, it seems to me it was a pirate ship that sunk.
15701740	15703740	What did you say?
15703740	15708740	Well, I'm pretty sure I saw the skull and crossbones flying from the mast.
15708740	15712740	And I think I caught sight of a cannon, but I could have been mistaken.
15712740	15713740	You must be joking.
15713740	15714740	I never joke.
15714740	15720740	I can't see anything. It's too far away to make out any sort of skull and crossbones.
15720740	15721740	Try this.
15721740	15723740	Ah, you've got a telescope.
15723740	15726740	Now why didn't you let me have this before? It might have helped.
15727740	15728740	Oh!
15742740	15744740	Ah, that's it. She's gone.
15750740	15753740	I suppose that there aren't many pirate ships around today.
15753740	15758740	Any that are afloat must be so old that they'd probably break up easily.
15758740	15762740	That's if it was a pirate ship, but it sure looked like one right enough.
15762740	15765740	Nothing's been washed up on the shore yet?
15765740	15767740	No, not a thing.
15770740	15774740	Isn't it strange that I was reading that book about pirates yesterday?
15774740	15777740	They probably wouldn't be quite so romantic in real life.
15777740	15781740	Well, in the book they were really great. I wish I'd been one.
15781740	15782740	A pirate?
15782740	15784740	Yeah, what could be more exciting?
15784740	15786740	You can't mean that.
15786740	15792740	Oh yes, I do. To sail across the seven seas, the holds of your ship's crammed with treasurers.
15792740	15796740	But you'd have to steal the treasure from somebody first, though, movement.
15796740	15802740	Well, yes, alright. I suppose so. But I wouldn't steal anything from anyone.
15802740	15806740	Ah, then you're just a sailor. Not a pirate at all.
15806740	15813740	Boom and mama, do you know where Moomin is?
15813740	15816740	He's probably in Snuffkin's tent.
15816740	15817740	Oh, yeah?
15817740	15820740	Snork maiden, I have a letter for you.
15820740	15823740	Yeah, you are. It's from the snork.
15823740	15828740	Oh, thank you. Wait a minute, little my. I want to read Snork's letter.
15828740	15830740	Take your time.
15837740	15840740	Oh, what's the matter?
15840740	15843740	It's Snork. He's coming home today.
15843740	15844740	That's nice.
15844740	15847740	But Moomin, mama, there's no food in the house at all.
15847740	15850740	Now, don't worry about that, Snork maiden.
15850740	15854740	I'll rustle up some dinner for us, and Snork can tell us all about his trip.
15854740	15855740	Boom and Papa like that.
15855740	15859740	Oh, thank you, mama. Snork doesn't like missing his meals.
15859740	15862740	He must have got the part sooner than he thought.
15862740	15864740	Ha, that's great news.
15864740	15866740	He should finish his flying ship soon, hey?
15866740	15868740	I guess so.
15868740	15871740	He should make it into a pirate flying ship.
15871740	15876740	I could be his first maid, and no one would be able to catch us. Nobody at all.
15876740	15879740	Ha, ha, ha.
15879740	15881740	Not here.
15881740	15884740	Oh, dear. I wonder where they've gone, little my.
15884740	15887740	There's nobody here.
15887740	15890740	Moomin probably wanted to go looking for an adventure.
15890740	15894740	I bet they went down to the beach to see if anything's been washed out.
15894740	15896740	At least the hangar's not been damaged.
15896740	15900740	Let's go down to the beach. We may find a treasure chest.
15900740	15903740	Huh?
15905740	15907740	What is it?
15907740	15909740	I just thought I heard something.
15909740	15911740	Where? From in there.
15911740	15913740	Hmm, weird.
15913740	15916740	Oh, I know. The snork must have come back.
15916740	15919740	Oh, yes. Snork. Of course.
15920740	15923740	Hello, snork.
15923740	15926740	Oh, snork. Are you in here?
15926740	15928740	Mm-hmm.
15928740	15930740	Ah!
15932740	15935740	Snork me.
15935740	15937740	Huh?
15941740	15945740	Put her down.
15945740	15948740	Oh, really? It was actually a pirate ship.
15948740	15953740	It was indeed Moomin Papa, and we caught the pirates when they swam ashore.
15953740	15956740	Do you think you captured all of them, Inspector?
15956740	15960740	Well, of course, we don't know exactly how many there were to begin with.
15960740	15966740	Hmm, right. I better barricade ourselves in Moomin House just to be on the safe side.
15966740	15972740	Oh, dear. And I suppose I ought to stand guard over my greenhouse as well.
15973740	15978740	Blast me, beansoles. Come here, you little pineapple.
15978740	15982740	Do let snork me go. You'll be sorry. You great big hairy folly.
15982740	15987740	No, not in your life. That won't just my hostage. I needed to make good my escape, but go.
15987740	15990740	Then you only have yourself to blame.
15990740	15996740	Hey, what? Blame? Stay where you are now. I will not be bitten again. Keep away a little cat.
15996740	15998740	Well, don't hurt her then.
15999740	16004740	Hurt her, you little shark. She's a hostage. Come me one at that. She'll be my safe passenger.
16004740	16006740	These rough waters are perished.
16006740	16010740	Well, then you better take me instead, because I'm much easier to carry.
16010740	16014740	You, huh? Nobody would care if I fed you slowly to the shrimps.
16014740	16018740	Oh, yes, lots of people. When you overstab win, babe.
16018740	16022740	All right, all right. Hold your head. We'd blow me down. No, what's your name, girl?
16022740	16024740	I'm Lil Mai.
16024740	16028740	I'm Captain Rumpod. Not going to get whatever authorities you have in this backwater.
16028740	16030740	Hurry, my patience is short.
16030740	16034740	I'll only go if you promise that you won't hurt snork maiden.
16034740	16036740	Of course I won't.
16036740	16040740	If I find that you've hurt her in any way at all, my revenge will be terrible.
16040740	16043740	All right, all right, all right.
16055740	16059740	Oh, boy.
16070740	16076740	Captain Rumpod, you are surrounded. Let snork maiden go. Do you hear me, Captain?
16076740	16083740	Do a gold button land lover like you never. She's a good-looking wench fair skinned and nicely rounded.
16083740	16088740	Pirates prefer blondes. Give me a ship and you can have her back.
16088740	16091740	What do you say to that, my buckhole?
16091740	16096740	You're on your own, Captain. We've got all your men locked up tight.
16096740	16098740	All me crew?
16098740	16102740	You're the last one. Now, let her go immediately.
16102740	16106740	Thank you for saving me crew. I feared they were all lost.
16106740	16109740	Don't thank me. They're all in jail.
16109740	16113740	Ah, someone said it's the best place for them, but not me.
16113740	16116740	Now let them out. I need them and a proper ship.
16116740	16122740	Oh, with two masks and fifty cannon and no tricks else it'll be worse for the girl.
16123740	16126740	This is too much.
16126740	16129740	The school for constables didn't tell us about this.
16129740	16132740	What should we do, Inspector?
16134740	16136740	Police gets snorked making away from him.
16136740	16138740	I'm afraid you'll hurt her and she'll be frightened.
16138740	16141740	I'm trying my best, but it's very awkward all this.
16141740	16144740	I've not come across anything like it before.
16144740	16147740	Oh, but it's not her fault that his ship sank, Inspector.
16147740	16150740	I know, I know. Oh, dear, oh dear.
16150740	16153740	Oh, I should have been a gardener.
16153740	16156740	Hey, are you still there, you ruffian?
16156740	16161740	Let my men go and get my ship. Two masks and fifty cannon mines.
16161740	16165740	Look, Captain Rumpod, I'm afraid the times have changed.
16165740	16168740	Sailing ships don't have cannon these days.
16168740	16171740	Shiver me timbers. How do you sink each other then?
16171740	16174740	I don't try to fool me. Remember, I've got the girl.
16174740	16178740	I think Moomin Papa has an old blender bus I'm sure he'll let you have.
16178740	16181740	I don't know if it'll work, though. That's all I've got.
16181740	16185740	I'm one of you, Peabrain. This is my final word, so listen well.
16185740	16190740	You have two hours to get the ship ready to sail and all my crew with her mine.
16190740	16192740	Or else I'll...
16192740	16195740	Now, don't worry, my pretty one. I won't have a single hair on your head,
16195740	16198740	but I must have something to threaten them with.
16198740	16203740	Or else I'll feed her to the hungry shark.
16203740	16206740	Oscar, I won't hurt you.
16206740	16207740	Are you sure?
16207740	16211740	Either I get my ship, Oak, fifty cannon, and at least two masters.
16211740	16215740	She'll be food for lobsters. It's your choice, my husband.
16215740	16217740	That should do it.
16219740	16221740	He sounds as if he'll do it, too.
16221740	16226740	Two hours, he says, a real feeder to the shark. Oh, dear, oh, dear.
16226740	16230740	What will Snork say, oh, dear, oh, dear?
16232740	16234740	I have a great idea, sir.
16234740	16238740	Why don't we climb onto the roof, drill a hole, and then drop something on his head?
16238740	16243740	You know, Constable, I've always thought you were an idiot, and now you've proved it.
16243740	16245740	Excuse me, Inspector.
16245740	16249740	If we set fire to the hangar, then they'll have to come out, won't they?
16249740	16253740	Shut up! Why am I surrounded by fools?
16253740	16255740	Oh, this is no good.
16255740	16259740	I must calm down, I must calm down.
16259740	16261740	Captain Rumbot!
16261740	16263740	Can you hear me, Captain?
16263740	16266740	Aha, you found a ship already, have you?
16266740	16270740	Well, no, there aren't any real sailing ships in Moomin Valley.
16270740	16272740	The chief Constable has a yacht.
16272740	16276740	He doesn't usually let anyone borrow it, but I'm sure in this case he...
16276740	16280740	I want something big enough to take me to the Spanish main, I warn you!
16280740	16284740	To calm down, Captain, calm down, now just listen to me.
16284740	16288740	You haven't done anything wrong here, no pirating or such like,
16288740	16292740	so if you forget about the boat, we'll let you all go, think about it.
16292740	16295740	Three to go anywhere you like, on foot, of course.
16295740	16301740	The fresh air, the sun on your face, no worry of shipwrecks, no storms at sea.
16301740	16303740	What do you think we are?
16303740	16305740	Huh, we're pirates, not high-wamen.
16305740	16308740	It's not so bad being a high-wamen, you know?
16308740	16311740	There'll be lots of rich travelers on the other side of Lonely Mountain,
16311740	16314740	I'm sure, and lots of adventures with jewels and gold.
16314740	16318740	Day me with flagens are rubbed your chicken brain, nitwit!
16318740	16319740	Nitwit?
16319740	16321740	No, niggum poop, dumb bill!
16321740	16322740	I'm Captain Rumbot!
16322740	16324740	You're making me very angry!
16324740	16327740	If I had you on my ship, you'd dangle from the yard!
16327740	16329740	I'm yet to walk the blade!
16329740	16331740	The inspectors lose control.
16331740	16333740	We had better calm him down.
16334740	16336740	What the crank would I?
16336740	16339740	And in my prison, you'd get no butter in their bread,
16339740	16341740	and maggots on your biscuits!
16342740	16343740	Please calm down, sister.
16343740	16344740	Please calm down, sister.
16344740	16345740	Calm down.
16345740	16346740	Calm down, take care.
16346740	16347740	Be easy.
16347740	16348740	Are you sure?
16348740	16349740	We water!
16349740	16352740	I'd see through it that the bread was milled!
16357740	16360740	That's 30 minutes gone already!
16364740	16366740	I warned you, gold button.
16366740	16369740	Now there is only one hour to her painful and horrible death!
16372740	16374740	Cheer up, Snark Maiden!
16374740	16376740	Try and hold on!
16376740	16378740	We'll get you out!
16378740	16379740	Water?
16379740	16380740	Water?
16380740	16381740	Huh?
16381740	16382740	What did you say?
16382740	16383740	Water, please.
16383740	16385740	I'm so thirsty.
16385740	16386740	Water?
16386740	16387740	Nasty?
16387740	16388740	I'm thirsty.
16388740	16389740	Water?
16389740	16390740	Nasty?
16390740	16391740	I'm thirsty.
16391740	16392740	Water?
16392740	16394740	Nasty stuff, still.
16395740	16397740	Hey, land lovers!
16397740	16398740	Compliments to the galley!
16398740	16400740	The young lady wants a drink!
16400740	16401740	All right, captain.
16401740	16403740	I'm coming, Snark Maiden.
16404740	16405740	I'll take it, Inspector.
16405740	16407740	It's too dangerous.
16407740	16409740	You must leave it to us now, moment.
16409740	16411740	Just a minute, Inspector.
16411740	16413740	I think we should let Moomin go,
16413740	16415740	and I've got an idea that just might work.
16415740	16416740	Snark him!
16417740	16418740	It'll take an awful lot of courage,
16418740	16420740	and you'll have to do it all on your own.
16420740	16422740	Do you think you can do it, Moomin?
16422740	16423740	Of course.
16428740	16429740	Splice me, mate.
16429740	16431740	Raise what's taken him so long.
16431740	16433740	Keep it a young lady in waiting.
16433740	16434740	It's all right.
16434740	16436740	I really don't mind waiting.
16436740	16437740	Tell you the truth.
16437740	16439740	I can do it and drink myself.
16439740	16440740	It's thirsty work.
16440740	16441740	Shouting at idiot policeman.
16441740	16442740	Don't you worry, little one.
16442740	16444740	They'll be here soon.
16445740	16447740	Get me a drink, too!
16447740	16448740	You hear it!
16448740	16449740	Quick about it!
16449740	16452740	I've brought you something to drink, Captain.
16453740	16455740	Right, come on, then.
16455740	16457740	And no funny stuff.
16457740	16459740	Don't worry. I'm on my own.
16460740	16462740	Have you done a drink for me, too?
16462740	16463740	Yes, Captain.
16463740	16466740	All right. Stay there and put down the train.
16468740	16470740	The bigger one is for you, Captain.
16470740	16472740	And the little one for Snark, mate.
16472740	16474740	Now move away.
16475740	16477740	And for enough, stay there.
16480740	16483740	Hmm. Why is it so red?
16484740	16486740	Well, it's strawberry juice.
16486740	16488740	It's very good.
16492740	16493740	I'll be polite.
16493740	16496740	She can drink from this one and I'll have hers.
16496740	16499740	But, Captain, there's not enough for you in the small one.
16500740	16503740	Strawberry juice isn't exactly my favorite tip of your know.
16503740	16505740	No, the small one will do.
16506740	16508740	Here you are, young lady.
16509740	16512740	No, no, Snark, mate. And please, don't drink it.
16513740	16516740	Why not, my young bucko? It's not poison, is it?
16516740	16518740	Don't be silly. Poisoned.
16518740	16519740	Oh, no, no.
16519740	16521740	Perhaps a sleeping potion.
16523740	16525740	Hmm. As I thought.
16525740	16529740	I deemed in mighty strange that two cups were prepared.
16529740	16530740	You drink it.
16530740	16533740	Oh, no, no, no, sir. I'm not thirsty at all.
16534740	16537740	What's the matter, Miland? You said the drink wasn't poisoned, didn't you?
16538740	16539740	So, drink!
16539740	16540740	Movement?
16540740	16542740	Ah, you're her swing, are you?
16543740	16545740	I shall never understand women anyway.
16545740	16548740	One of you will have to drink it, and now!
16549740	16552740	Not far, I'll do it. I'll do it. Give it to me.
16552740	16556740	No, movement, don't. There's something in it. You'll be poisoned.
16556740	16559740	It's all right, Snark, mate. It's nothing dangerous.
16559740	16561740	Don't worry about me.
16561740	16562740	I'll drink it.
16563740	16565740	Oh.
16565740	16568740	That's it. Drink up again.
16572740	16574740	Down the hatch, Miland.
16576740	16578740	You're lucky it wasn't poisoned.
16579740	16580740	Yeah.
16581740	16583740	And no sleeping potion, neither?
16583740	16587740	Oh, no. Nothing at all. Nothing.
16588740	16592740	Oh, movement! Oh, no, movement!
16592740	16594740	You're not my pretty one.
16594740	16599740	Your wimpy little bow is just taking a nap. You'll be right as rain's soon.
16603740	16605740	And he thought he could fool me.
16605740	16608740	Me, Captain Rumpot, but she can't.
16608740	16610740	Well, I'll have the other one.
16614740	16615740	Not bad.
16616740	16618740	No, I'm sorry, young lady.
16618740	16620740	They'll have to bring you another.
16620740	16623740	Shall we order one without the draft?
16623740	16626740	They'll be surprised when they see me still on my pins.
16627740	16630740	Why do I not sleep at all?
16632740	16634740	Let's go and give my surprise, huh?
16635740	16636740	Oh.
16637740	16638740	Oh.
16642740	16643740	Oh.
16643740	16645740	Yay!
16647740	16649740	A moment!
16649740	16652740	It's all right. I'm okay, Snorgmaiden.
16652740	16655740	There's nothing in this drink. Would you like some?
16655740	16657740	A moment. You mean you?
16657740	16660740	Well, I was pretending. So I convinced you too, huh?
16660740	16662740	A moment!
16667740	16671740	Captain Rumpot didn't wake up that day, or the next.
16671740	16676740	And when he did, he had a terrible headache, which served him right.
16683740	16686740	The inspector let all the pirates go after a week.
16686740	16689740	Well, they hadn't done any pirating in Moomin Valley,
16689740	16693740	and wouldn't be doing any either, not without a ship.
16696740	16697740	I'm sorry.
16697740	16698740	I'm sorry.
16698740	16699740	I'm sorry.
16699740	16700740	I'm sorry.
16700740	16701740	I'm sorry.
16701740	16702740	I'm sorry.
16702740	16703740	I'm sorry.
16703740	16704740	I'm sorry.
16704740	16705740	I'm sorry.
16705740	16706740	I'm sorry.
16706740	16707740	I'm sorry.
16707740	16708740	I'm sorry.
16708740	16709740	I'm sorry.
16709740	16710740	I'm sorry.
16710740	16711740	I'm sorry.
16711740	16712740	I'm sorry.
16712740	16713740	I'm sorry.
16713740	16714740	I'm sorry.
16714740	16715740	I'm sorry.
16715740	16716740	I'm sorry.
16716740	16717740	I'm sorry.
16717740	16718740	I'm sorry.
16718740	16719740	I'm sorry.
16719740	16720740	I'm sorry.
