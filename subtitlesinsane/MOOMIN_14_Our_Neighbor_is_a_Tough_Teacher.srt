1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Therefore you are your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They are the movements, they are the movements,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,920
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:01:52,200
just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements, there was the movement, there was the movement, there was the movement, there was the movement La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la The weather was far too beautiful for a woman Papa to concentrate on writing his memoirs,

9
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
so he went for a walk instead.

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,400
Good morning, Mr. Hamilton.

11
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,480
Ah, a woman Papa.

12
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,200
Have you found a new plan or something?

13
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm afraid not, and I think I must have examined every single plant in Moomin Valley.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I know what you mean. There isn't a single person living here that I don't know.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, yes, yes, quite.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Look, why don't you come over and have a cup of tea, Mr. Evelyn? Hmm? Isn't that moment a little, my?

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, I think it is.

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Really, a moment, Papa, peeping into people's homes.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, it's an empty house, Mr. Hemmellon.

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Moment, what are you looking at?

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, hello, Papa. Nobody's lived in there for years. Somebody's just moved in.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, really?

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let me have a look.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, goodness.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How tidy they are.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Perhaps the children will play with us.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, they might, but they seem a bit too well behaved for that.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I must have a closer look at them.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Me too, Mum and Papa, but I'm not going to be able to they might, but they seem a bit too well behaved for that.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I must have a closer look at them.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Me too, Moomin Papa, but the trouble is they never come outside the fence.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Well, in that case, we'll have to go in.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How do we do that, Papa?

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We can't just walk in there.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
See, you want to borrow some sugar? That should do it.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh, Mr. Hamilton, where's your imagination?

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Will you please lend me your magnifying glass?

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But surely. Here it is.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh, that should do it.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What are you going to do, Papa?

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Now then, you all stay out here.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
My plan will only work if it looks as though I'm on my own.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh, but what is your plan, Papa?

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I hope Papa knows what he's doing.

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They don't look that friendly to me. Me neither.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Mama, there's someone coming.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh! What do you want, my good man? Come on, tell me quickly. Do you hear me?

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hmm. Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I didn't think anyone lived here.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well, we do know. You know we just moved in.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Really? Oh, do forgive me, madame. I certainly didn't mean to trespass.

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Ah, so what are you doing here in the garden, man?

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Researching the travel system of ants.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,279
I didn't know they had one.

55
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,759
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's fascinating.

56
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,000
How they find their way and build their roads,

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,680
and they're not here now, of course.

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,160
But this is their main road.

59
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,920
It's very quiet at the moment, but at busy times, it's packed.

60
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,600
I'm afraid I can't see any main road.

61
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,720
Oh, you would if you were an expert.

62
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,399
Anyway, I'll point it out to you next time they're on the move.

63
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,199
If I'm in the vicinity, of course, but it's worth looking out for.

64
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,800
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

65
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,300
I'm your next door neighbor, though.

66
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,800
We live quite a long way away.

67
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
I'm Moomin.

68
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,300
Ah! So you must be Moomin Papa, are you?

69
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
Ah, yes.

70
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,300
That's me.

71
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,800
Ha, ha, how did you know?

72
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Ha, ha, ha.

73
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,759
Did someone mention my name to you?

74
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,560
We were told the moments were a bit unusual. Very nice, they said though.

75
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
How very flattering, thank you.

76
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,279
And you're Mrs.

77
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,040
Billy John, mother and housewife.

78
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,000
Well, it's an honor to meet you. Mrs. Philly John.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Well done, Papa. It looks like you found us some new friends to play with.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh, welcome, party.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't you think it's a good idea? We haven't had a party for ages, Mama.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But you hardly know them, and I've never even met them.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But, Mama, how can we show them that they're really welcome

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,199
and they could meet everyone at a party, couldn't they?

85
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,360
And I could take care of all the children.

86
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,360
I know just what to do.

87
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,120
Splendid moment.

88
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,079
Ah, Mr. Hebblin, I know, moment papa.

89
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,079
You'd like me to do the fireworks.

90
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,800
It looks like we're throwing a party.

91
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,000
We'll have lots of pretty flowers. Just tell me what you want, mama, and we'll do it.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's great! Those kids will just love it!

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If they survive, mumen! It's great! Those kids will just love it!

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If they survive, movement!

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Now then, children! The movements are all a little bit odd, so behead properly!

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes, mother, we will!

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They'll be here soon. Take this in, movement! Yes, mother, we will.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
They'll be here soon. Take this in, Mummett. Okay.

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The joke works really well.

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh, good. I must try it.

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Mmm, these look nice.

102
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh, stiff. Leave them alone, will you?

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, all right. Just this one.

104
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,240
Huh? Huh?

105
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,980
They're here.

106
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,180
Come on, everybody.

107
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,279
They'll soon be at the door.

108
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,139
Right.

109
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:33,439
Come on, children.

110
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,839
Help me with the flowers.

111
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,920
Oh, dear.

112
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,079
Fireworks now are later on.

113
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh, later on, I think you'll very hold finally. Welcome to Moomin House, Mrs. Philly John. It was very kind of you to invite us, Moomin Lama.

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Come in, please, and make yourselves at home.

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, thank you all very much indeed.

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,699
Welcome to Moomin Valley. Welcome to Moomin Valley. Welcome to Moomin Valley. Welcome to Moomin Valley. Welcome to Moomin Valley. Welcome to Moomin Valley. You're watching, Deed.

130
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,300
Welcome to Moomin Valley.

131
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,100
All in my hair. It looks very untidy, doesn't it, mother?

132
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,300
It's a surprise.

133
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,500
They should have been rose buds,

134
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,199
but we couldn't find any at all.

135
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,500
Oh, yes.

136
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,199
Dear, what a mess. Mrs. Mrs. Philly chunk let me introduce the

137
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,759
children. They all look different. Well yes only

138
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:39,639
movement is really ours the others are sort of I'm sure they'll all get on. Oh

139
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:45,840
I'm afraid my children do not play. They would much rather read or study.

140
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,799
Oh, are you sure they've got to have some time for play?

141
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,559
I'm sure.

142
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,360
Well, come into the dining room anyway.

143
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,679
You can watch the others play.

144
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,759
Make sure the chairs are clean.

145
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,080
Yes, Mother, we will.

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Won't you let them play at all?

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No, I will not.

148
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,000
Come on, everybody.

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Wouldn't you like to have a go on our slide?

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
No.

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Hmm.

152
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You'd really enjoy it once you got going.

153
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I know you would.

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No, thank you. No, no, not at all.

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
No, definitely not.

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And you're really quite sure, are you?

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I thought so.

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Then we've got it all to ourselves.

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yahoo! No! No! No!

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No!

162
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No!

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No!

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No!

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
No!

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No!

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
No!

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No!

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No!

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
No! No! Oh, and that's little May and sniff.

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Your children seem very quiet, Mrs. Philly junk.

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Good children are seen and not heard right here.

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That was one of mine.

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And that was another.

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, it sounds like they're having fun for once.

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
To have a biscuit Mrs. Philly junk.

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
They have an unusual taste.

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'd run out of flowers, so I used them.

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh!

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't worry.

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Move them a little bit after them.

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh!

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Go on.

184
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's your turn now.

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Wee!

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Wee! Wee! Oh! Go on, it's your turn now.

187
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yay!

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yay!

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Whoa!

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh, my children!

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yay!

192
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh!

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh!

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Stop it, it's too dangerous.

195
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You might hurt yourself.

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,159
Yay! Oh, come on! It's too dangerous. You might hurt yourself. I see. No!

197
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,159
Ha ha!

198
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,960
Oh, come on! Stop it at once!

199
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,799
Now, don't you worry, Mrs. Villageunk.

200
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,720
I got ointment in my bag if I hurt themselves.

201
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
But you'll hear mother.

202
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,240
Ha ha ha ha!

203
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:27,000
Stop children! You hear me? We're going home now.

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Stop it.

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Oh, this is really hard for us to kill them.

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I think it's time for the glorious finale, Papa.

207
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I can't say I wasn't warned.

208
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,320
Exposing them to this,

209
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,279
Movement Valley is no place for proper children.

210
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,799
No place at all.

211
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,600
Oh, dear, what's this?

212
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,799
There are fireworks in your honor.

213
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,840
Fireworks?

214
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:14,720
I made them especially to welcome you.

215
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,639
Goodbye! Come back soon!

216
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,080
Yeah, welcome to the park! No, you will not!

217
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,279
I don't think Mrs. Philly John can enjoy her party.

218
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,000
She's very lucky that I didn't think Mrs. Philly John can join her party. She's very lucky that I didn't bite her.

219
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
She should have had a go on the slide.

220
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm sure she would have loved it.

221
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And then she wouldn't have shouted at her children.

222
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Don't up, don't slide down, shoot sniff.

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They're too afraid of looking silly.

224
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Whoa!

225
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Oh, oh.

226
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Papa.

227
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh, I'm very sorry, moment, but don't worry, I'll fix it.

228
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It is nothing much broken.

229
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What happened, my dear?

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, I thought it had been such a long time since I'd been on the slide that I'd have a go.

231
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I didn't think I'd be too heavy for it.

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I know. When we mend it, why don't we make it strong enough for me and Mama to play on as well?

233
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I think she'd like that.

234
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's a good idea, Papa. But we want to use it too.

235
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, that's a course. I just try it out. Now and again.

236
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I want you to stay here while I'm out. What if somebody asks us to play? What do you mean? Play.

237
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I hope you're not thinking of the mommens, are you?

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't want you mixing with those noisy children ever again.

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You hear me?

240
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Where are you going, mother?

241
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
To look for another house.

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,059
It was a terrible mistake coming to Mumen Valley. again do you hear me where are you going mother to look for another house it

243
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:50,000
was a terrible mistake coming to move in valley

244
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,080
look there's Mrs. Philly drunk good afternoon please stay away from my

245
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,000
children but why?

246
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We thought they might like to come and have an adventure with us.

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh, never mind. Let's go.

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Hey, hang on a minute!

249
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Hey!

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, your tar-sa! Yeah!

251
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

252
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Oh, no!

253
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Oh, no!

254
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I can't see!

255
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's too late for you now, Sniff!

256
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh, no, not the hungry crocodile at the bottom of the porch!

257
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We should have brought the Philly Junks with us.

258
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,200
But Moon and Mrs. Philly Junks... We need to look tall, her.

259
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,000
Have you been killed and eaten yet, Sniff?

260
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,799
No, I fell on top of the crocodile and knocked him out, and then swam ashore.

261
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:18,200
Sniff, but I thought you couldn't swim.

262
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,399
On your own business.

263
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:29,000
Hey, that looks like the Philly Junks!

264
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Why don't they come over here? I bet their mother told them not to talk to us.

265
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Huh? See if I care you!

266
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,960
Hey! What are you doing? Why aren't you playing with Mormon and the others?

267
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,440
I don't think they want to play with us.

268
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,639
They didn't call for us when they went past.

269
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,000
Stinky's arrived and wonder what he's doing here.

270
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,960
I bet you it's no fun stuck in that garden.

271
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,679
No, we'd rather be out here playing.

272
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,559
Well, I know somewhere much better than moments.

273
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,399
It's a great place to play.

274
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,200
Do you?

275
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,720
Yes, would I lie to you?

276
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,279
It's a bit of a way off, but it'll be really exciting

277
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,000
and lots of fun so do you want to come or not.

278
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,080
Well, it is a bit boring here.

279
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Yes, very.

280
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,000
Do you really think they don't want to play with us?

281
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Doesn't look like it.

282
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Your brother's absolutely right.

283
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So come on if you're coming, because I can't wait.

284
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What stinky up, too?

285
00:16:32,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't trust him. Okay, now this is the place I told you about. Good, isn't it? Now, if you hang on to that rope, you can swing over to the other side and back again. Don't worry, it's quite safe.

286
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's great. I've never been anywhere like this.

287
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
A bit frightening.

288
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Without the thrill, where's the fun?

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You need a bit of danger to spice it up.

290
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Gee, Willikers, it looks like the other side is higher than this side.

291
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes, I bet it's all right. You just have to put your legs up. That's all.

292
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,799
Who wants to go first?

293
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,599
I've got it. Why don't you all go together?

294
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,440
What?

295
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,519
The three of us?

296
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,799
See, this way it won't feel so scared, will you?

297
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,799
No, not together.

298
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:38,720
Well, why don't you go one at a time then?

299
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
That way it's always more fun.

300
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,279
Can you do it, stinky?

301
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:47,119
Don't be silly. Of course I can. I do it all the time.

302
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,720
One of the things I'm best at. Even if I do say so myself. So why don't you show us Stinky?

303
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,680
Moonin! I didn't know you were such a rop swinger Stinky. I'm sure he didn't either.

304
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,000
So this is your usual place, is it? Well, sort of.

305
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You know something? If you hadn't said that you'd done this lots of times,

306
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I wouldn't have believed that I could have done it myself.

307
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Come on, Stinky, show us how you do it.

308
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
If you go first, I'll be second.

309
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
No, it's alright. You can go first, Mom.

310
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But I want to see how it's done. Then throw me the rope and I'll follow.

311
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Now, tell the truth. You've never done it. Have you stinky?

312
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Of course I've done it, stupid!

313
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Now come on, come on. Don't be such a spoiled sport.

314
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
We're all here waiting to cheer you on.

315
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,839
Alright, everybody. I give you the brave, evolved Tarzan Stinky.

316
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,279
You watching?

317
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,400
Are you ready, Stinky?

318
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,079
A big cheer, everyone!

319
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:51,599
Ready?

320
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,640
Yeah!

321
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,680
Oh, Stinky, my big brave here, oh, jump!

322
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,640
Well, go on, we're all waiting for you, Stinky.

323
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,160
Come on, Stinky, show us how to jump.

324
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,720
Come on, Stinky, come on, you can do it.

325
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Come on, you can do it.

326
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,200
Jump! Stinky shorts out. Come on, Stinky! Come on, you can do it. You can do it. You can do it.

327
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Whoa!

328
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Huh?

329
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Huh?

330
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Huh?

331
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Huh?

332
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Whoa!

333
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
Whoa!

334
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh, so this is how you've done it lots of times before, is it?

335
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yes, the rope is the straw!

336
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He was trying to fool you.

337
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It was a dangerous game, and he knew very well it couldn't be done.

338
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I did it!

339
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Now, why don't you come with us and play properly?

340
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You're gonna be tired, as long as you like!

341
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And when you get tired, just let go of the rope!

342
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
All right, Steve?

343
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Mama, take it!

344
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah!

345
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You can't just leave me here, you fuck!

346
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Uh, uh, innocent, fair please!

347
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Help! Don't leave me here!

348
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Woo!

349
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Woo! Woo! Woo!

350
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Woo!

351
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Woo! Yeah!

352
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But Stinky was left on his own to decide whether to climb up the rope or drop into the river.

353
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And the Phyllis-Jong children had more fun than they'd ever had before,

354
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
but they didn't get home until very late in the evening.

355
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Bye, we'll see you tomorrow.

356
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,519
Okay, mommy. Okay, Moomin.

357
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,599
Bye, Moomin.

358
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,720
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

359
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,920
Oh, my dear children, I told you to stand home.

360
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,400
What earth have you been?

361
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,920
Where have you been?

362
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,559
With movement and the others.

363
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,400
They kidnapped you, did they?

364
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,000
No, we've been playing with them.

365
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,039
Well, you can just forget about the movements.

366
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,539
We're moving out as soon as we possibly can.

367
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,279
Moving, mother?

368
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,240
Yes, right away from this valley,

369
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,819
this is no place for a spotless and well-ordered home.

370
00:20:56,819 --> 00:20:59,220
What's the matter?

371
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,259
No, we don't want to move.

372
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,619
Ah.

373
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:04,460
We want to stay, mother.

374
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,000
Oh!

375
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Muminhouse is nice and dusty.

376
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We want to stay in Mumin Valley forever.

377
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh, please, mother. We love it here.

378
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, after all I've done for you children.

379
00:21:17,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And my experience children usually get what they want. What? And that was how Phila Junk and her three children became permanent residents of Mumen Valley.

380
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

381
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

382
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
They're always happy and always at play.

383
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

384
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The movements.

385
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The movements.

386
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They love the laughter and they love the living.

387
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The movements, believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

388
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
They're always happy and goes at play.

389
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

390
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The movements, the movements, the moment.
