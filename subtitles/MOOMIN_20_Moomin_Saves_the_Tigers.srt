1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,560
here they are for one and all the moments are about to come on and sit down here with

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:30,440
me they're for you on your TV they are the moments they are the moments so come

3
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:37,240
with me give me your hand I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just

4
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:44,640
like a bird sing that song ever there were the moments there were the

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:57,840
moments there was the moments there were the moments there were the moments

6
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,480
Vah, vva, vva, vva, vva …

7
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:32,060
Vah, vva, vva, vva, vva …

8
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:52,980
The rhino and the tigers that stinky set free from the zoo are now living in the jungle

9
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,420
that has grown up around Moomin house and have settled into the restful life of Moomin

10
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,420
Valley.

11
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,420
Hey, have you seen Moomin?

12
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,420
No, you haven't seen him all evening.

13
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,420
Hmm.

14
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,420
I wonder where they got to.

15
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,700
Meanwhile, Moomin and Snork Maiden chased by the snake and are swimming as fast as they

16
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,700
can out to sea.

17
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,700
I can't swim another.

18
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,700
Soon must not wait until you bust.

19
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,700
Hey!

20
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,700
Hey, you there!

21
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,700
Come on, Snork Maiden!

22
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,700
Nearly there!

23
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,620
Look, there's a couple of hippos that come in towards us.

24
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,860
We better get them on board.

25
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,860
That's funny.

26
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,540
I haven't heard about any hippos reported missing from the zoo lately.

27
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:53,540
Just a bit further, Snork Maiden.

28
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,540
We made it.

29
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,540
I didn't know hippos could climb so well.

30
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,700
Oh, thank you so much.

31
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,780
There was a huge snake chasing us.

32
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,580
Yes, we saw you were lucky we came along when we did.

33
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,900
Thank you for your help.

34
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,380
Who's ship is this?

35
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,380
ours.

36
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,380
We're from the zoo.

37
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,380
The zoo?

38
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,020
Oh, you've got one of the crocodiles.

39
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,060
Yes, and a lot of trouble he gave us as well.

40
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,860
There's another one around here somewhere.

41
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,860
We saw them.

42
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,060
Yes, we know there is, but we haven't been able to find him yet.

43
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,060
Oh, boy.

44
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,780
I wish they'd come as quietly as you hippos did.

45
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,780
Hippos?

46
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,780
Hippos?

47
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,540
Which zoo are you from?

48
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,780
I bet they'd pay well to get you back.

49
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,780
Now look here.

50
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,780
I'm a woman.

51
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Not a hippo.

52
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,780
Are you saying that?

53
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,780
I look like a hippo?

54
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,420
Well, perhaps they don't look exactly like hippos.

55
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,260
No, but they're close enough, Captain.

56
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,060
I'm sure they've escaped from the zoo somewhere, though.

57
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
Yes, sir.

58
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,020
We haven't escaped from anywhere.

59
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,340
Certainly not a zoo.

60
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
We live in Moomin Valley.

61
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,340
We're Moomin's.

62
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,660
It's all right, Snort Maiden.

63
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,220
I'll not be taken for a hippo.

64
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,940
Come on, let's run for it.

65
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,100
Hey, wait.

66
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,580
There's a nice cozy cage already for you.

67
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,900
Hurry, Snort Maiden.

68
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,660
Ask to them.

69
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,580
Stop them now.

70
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,420
Don't let them get away.

71
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,180
Huh?

72
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,020
Where are we going, Moomin?

73
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,020
Now to the sea.

74
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,780
Quickly, man.

75
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,700
Lower the light, boat.

76
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,420
They're not going to put us in any zoo.

77
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,860
Why did you come back?

78
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,980
I thought you were on the boat.

79
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,820
Oh, no.

80
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,780
Don't worry, I never eat anything when I'm not swimming.

81
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,340
Are you sure?

82
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,940
I'm sure I know where's this ship.

83
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,700
Oh, they're catching up with us.

84
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,500
They want to put us in a cage and take us to the zoo.

85
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,940
Me too, I expect.

86
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,700
They're always trying to get me.

87
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,140
They've got one of the crocodiles.

88
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,860
Oh, did they?

89
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,100
They were my friends.

90
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,780
Right.

91
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,260
Hang on to me, you two.

92
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,700
I'm certainly not going back to any zoo.

93
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,740
Never, let's go.

94
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,900
Oh, no.

95
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,340
Now hold on tight.

96
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,380
Come back, you horrible rascal.

97
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,380
Come back.

98
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,540
Moomin's been caught by a big snake.

99
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,220
Yes, mama snorked maiden as well.

100
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,780
Dear stinky, that's not true, is it?

101
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,660
I wish people wouldn't realize that I almost never lie.

102
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,140
I'm sorry about them, but I thought I'd better tell you.

103
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,380
Oh, there aren't any snakes that big in Moomin Valley.

104
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,900
There are tigers here, aren't there?

105
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,220
Well, there's big snakes too.

106
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,260
You brought the snake here, didn't you?

107
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,220
Papa, I'm not saying that I believe him,

108
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,100
but I think we'd better look for them just

109
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,060
to be on the safe side, don't you?

110
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,340
OK, don't believe me.

111
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,420
I've told you so my conscience is clear.

112
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,020
We're exactly to the snake attack them, stinky.

113
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,180
Down in the swamp by the sea.

114
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,100
Let's go, mama.

115
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,260
I'll come with you.

116
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,300
No, you'd better stay little, my, until Moomin, where we've

117
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,620
gone if he comes back.

118
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,180
He'll only worry if there's no one here.

119
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,980
And stinky, you show us where to go.

120
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,460
OK.

121
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,500
Hi!

122
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,620
Oh, oh, oh, I'm thinking now.

123
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

124
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,780
Hey, you.

125
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,460
Have you eaten Moomin and Snark Maiden?

126
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,460
It's all right, mama.

127
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
We're here.

128
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,220
Oh, praise the boo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

129
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,260
Say it.

130
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,260
Me time you, friend.

131
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,860
a very big friend. Please come in as much of you as you like.

132
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,260
Stinky just told us that you and Snorkmaiden

133
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,260
been caught by a big snake, so we...

134
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,260
Where are you going, Stinky?

135
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,260
She did chase us at first, then we managed to get on a boat,

136
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,260
but they wanted to put us in a cage,

137
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,260
so we jumped back in the sea, met the snake again,

138
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,260
then they tried to catch her too,

139
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,260
so she helped us to get away, and now she's our friend.

140
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,260
Who are they?

141
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,260
Men from the zoo. They've come to recapture all the animals

142
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,260
and take them away from the jungle, and put them in cages again.

143
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,260
Nice. Secondly, don't want to go back in the zoo.

144
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,260
Papa, we've got to protect our friends.

145
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
Yes, we have.

146
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,260
I'm sure that the tigers and that nice rhino don't want to go back either.

147
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,260
Oh, of course they don't.

148
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,260
They want to be free and let begin our jungle.

149
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,260
Why don't you go and explore it? I'm sure it'll be just like home.

150
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,260
And if you see the zoo people, you can come back here, can't you?

151
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,260
I'm sure you'll like it here, Missy Snake.

152
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,260
Yes, I'm sure I will.

153
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,260
Come on, I'll show you the jungle.

154
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,260
I'm so relieved that you're both all right at home.

155
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,260
So are we, Mama, but there's something we haven't told you.

156
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,260
Yes, they thought we were hippopotamuses.

157
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,260
What? Who did? They need their eyes, Destiny.

158
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,260
The men from the zoo. They thought we had escaped from another zoo,

159
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,260
and we're trying to catch us, and they nearly succeeded.

160
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,260
Hmm, a rude. We're not at all like hippos, the cheek of it.

161
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,260
So these men were only trying to capture our new friends,

162
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,260
but you and Snork Maiden as well.

163
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
And me and Papa if they'd known about us?

164
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,260
That's right, Mama.

165
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,260
They're idiots.

166
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,260
Hippopotamuses don't wear aprons or right memoirs.

167
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,260
That's really made me angry.

168
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,260
I bet they never faced the wrath of a movement Papa before.

169
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,260
I want to see you wrap yourself round and choke somebody.

170
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,260
I know. How about the tiger?

171
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,260
He do.

172
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,260
I'd rather not. We became friends in the zoo.

173
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,260
Oh, I know. Choke stinky. That'll be much better.

174
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Yes, my dewey did let us out of the zoo.

175
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,260
Well, you're a great disappointment to me.

176
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,260
I let you out because I thought you'd attack the movements,

177
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,260
but you have tea with them instead. You're pathetic. You know that?

178
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,260
I'm sorry, but we were brought up in captivity,

179
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,260
and we never had to hunt for our food. All our meals are brought to us, you see.

180
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,260
But your tigers, what do you eat them?

181
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,260
Well, we love cat food.

182
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,260
Cat food.

183
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,260
Oh, I don't believe it.

184
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,260
Yes, it's easy to chew and it leaves our fur all sleek and shiny.

185
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,260
We like the yellow tins with the black cat. Don't we, honey?

186
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,260
Yes, it's our favorite. You wouldn't happen to have any on you, would you?

187
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,260
Oh.

188
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,260
Mama! Papa, quickly!

189
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,260
They're here. The zoo men are here.

190
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,260
Oh, get all the animals into the house first, you.

191
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,260
Hurry, moment.

192
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,260
Okay, Papa.

193
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,260
The zoo men have come to get you.

194
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,260
Hurry, you'll be safe in the moment house.

195
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,260
Quick as you can, Rhino, into the house. Go on.

196
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,260
Now, Rhino, push them.

197
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,260
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,260
Um, I don't think that's a good place to hide, Mrs. Snake.

199
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,260
I'm afraid that doesn't look quite right, Tiger.

200
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,260
I thought I might just look like a thick rug.

201
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,260
I'll just lie here like a beautiful porcelain ornament.

202
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,260
They'll never know we're here, darling.

203
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,260
Well, they'd never expect to find a Rhino under there.

204
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,260
That's what I thought. Where are they?

205
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,260
They can't just have vanished into thin air.

206
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,260
Look, up there.

207
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,260
In the chimney.

208
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,260
So they're in there, are they?

209
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,260
Papa!

210
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,260
They've seen the snake. They're nearly here.

211
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,260
Now, I want you to calm down and be quiet, everyone.

212
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,260
We won't let them take you away.

213
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,260
I promise you they'll have a fight on the hands if they try.

214
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,260
Keep, please, my love.

215
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,260
Hello?

216
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,260
Hello? Hello?

217
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,260
Having a picnic, are you? It's lovely, Dave.

218
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,260
Not at all. We're all here from the zoo, sir.

219
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,260
Oh, are you on some sort of expedition?

220
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,260
Excuse me, but are you the owner of this house?

221
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,260
Yes, indeed I am. I'm movement papa. What can I do for you?

222
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,260
Why don't you consent out the animals hiding in your house?

223
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,260
That'll do for a start.

224
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,260
Animals?

225
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,260
Oh, no. We have firm believers that they belong out there.

226
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,260
Sir, you can't see from where you are, but I can assure you that there is a python sticking its head out of your chimney.

227
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,260
A python?

228
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,260
Yes, that's right.

229
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,260
No, it isn't.

230
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,260
It isn't.

231
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,260
No, it's my daughter. She happens to look like a python.

232
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,260
Not all the time you understand.

233
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,260
Right, come on, man. We'll go and get the zoo's property.

234
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,260
No, you will not enter my house.

235
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,260
All right, well, you let the animals out. We won't have to.

236
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,260
It's up to you, sir. There are no animals, and you won't enter my house.

237
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,260
Now, wait a minute. I do believe, yes. You're one of those hippos, aren't you?

238
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,260
I am not. I'm movement papa, and I am the owner of this house.

239
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,260
No, you're not. You're a hippopotamus. How dare you?

240
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,260
A hippo who owns a house, and it's also running an illegal zoo.

241
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Break down the doors.

242
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,260
That is against the law.

243
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,260
Oh, it is, isn't? Well, there's a nice cage winning for you as well, movement papa, hippo.

244
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,260
I warn you, if you touch that door, you'll regret it.

245
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,260
No, yeah.

246
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,260
Great boys, let's go in.

247
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,260
Charge!

248
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,260
Ah!

249
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,260
Now then, what's going on?

250
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Little Mike brought the inspector.

251
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,260
Oh, right. What do you mean that you're doing?

252
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,260
Ah, they're hiding animals from the zoo in this house. We want them back.

253
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,260
I tried to reason with the hippo, but it was no good.

254
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,260
Oh, have you know that's willful destruction of property, my good man?

255
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,260
It's not willful. We're from the zoo. We got to get in somehow.

256
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,260
Oh, have you, and can you be sure that there are zoo animals in there?

257
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:20,260
You just take a look up there at the chimney. That's all I'm sure. Go on.

258
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,260
See that python's head sticking out?

259
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,260
That's odd.

260
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,260
I can't see a python's head.

261
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,260
But there was a python's head up there, I saw it.

262
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,260
Ugh, I can't breathe.

263
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,260
Now you listen to me, zoo man.

264
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,260
Either you stop bothering my friends or I'll arrest you.

265
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,260
Is that clear? Well, is it?

266
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,260
Yes, sir, it is. But what about the zoo animals?

267
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,260
You heard the inspector now go away.

268
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,260
Do you see that?

269
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,260
See what?

270
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,260
The hippopotamus.

271
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,260
What?

272
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,260
The hippopotamus. He's the fellows from hiding all our zoo animals.

273
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,260
We got a nice cage lined up for him as well, inspector.

274
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,260
Oh, so that's your plan, is it?

275
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,260
Ha, they want to take them all.

276
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,260
Moomin, snork, me, mama, and papa.

277
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,260
Hmm, the criminal conspiracy.

278
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,260
Conspiracy?

279
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,260
It would probably be called kidnapping.

280
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,260
Once you can't kidnap a hippo.

281
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,260
That's a movement.

282
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,260
It could be white slavery, though.

283
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,260
I'm sure I could add incitement to riot to the list.

284
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,260
Now, I hate paperwork, so I'll tell you one.

285
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,260
If you're gone within 10 minutes, I won't arrest you.

286
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,260
Why don't you put them in the deepest dungeon, inspector?

287
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,260
The one with all the rats and spiders and scorpions

288
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,260
that'll teach them to put Moomin's encages.

289
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,260
That's a good idea, little mind. They like animals.

290
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,260
I'll start counting now.

291
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,260
One, two, three.

292
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,260
Get around men quickly.

293
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,260
All right.

294
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,260
We'll have to think quickly on this one, man.

295
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,260
Come on, now. Does anybody have any smart ideas?

296
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,260
Come on. We're running out of time.

297
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,260
One minute.

298
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,260
Look, guys, we're going to figure something out right now.

299
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,260
Ready and look.

300
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,260
One minute, thirty seconds.

301
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,260
Two minutes. Three minutes, thirty seconds.

302
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,260
Look.

303
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,260
Leave us alone, way we're conferring.

304
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,260
All right. Six minutes and fifty seconds.

305
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,260
Time's up.

306
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,260
You're cheating.

307
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,260
The police don't cheat, and now you've got...

308
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,260
nine minutes and thirty seconds.

309
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,260
How about that?

310
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,260
Nine minutes, fifty bucks, I give up.

311
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,260
Everybody beat it.

312
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,260
But we're still discussing it.

313
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,260
No, we're not. We're getting out.

314
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,260
Look, everyone, the zoom in, they're running off.

315
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,260
Great.

316
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,260
You've got to come and see this, Mama.

317
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,260
Nine minutes and fifty and a half seconds.

318
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,260
And don't come back. We'll be the dungeon for you.

319
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
And I make that ten minutes up to you.

320
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,260
You saved his little life.

321
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,260
It was really clever of you to fetch the inspector.

322
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,260
Well, there were too many of them for me to fight.

323
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,260
Okay? Everyone, come on now.

324
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,260
And so everyone was saved.

325
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,260
And eventually, they all came out of the house

326
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,260
to go and have fun in the jungle again.

327
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,260
As long as the warm weather lasted,

328
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,260
there were plenty of things to do.

329
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,260
But one day, the weather changed.

330
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,260
And cold winds blew down Moomin Valley.

331
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,260
Oh, it feels like autumn has arrived.

332
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,260
The jungle won't like the cold weather.

333
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,260
Do you think it will die, Mama?

334
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,260
I'm afraid it will, little my.

335
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,260
It grew very quickly, so perhaps it will go the same way.

336
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,260
And it did.

337
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,260
The whole jungle withered and died in just one night.

338
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,260
I think I've done a cold coming, Mama.

339
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,260
I'm sorry, I can't get the house any hotter.

340
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,260
I missed the zoo, at least it was warm now.

341
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,260
Yes, this cold is awful.

342
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,260
It would warm them up if we bird the dead jungle.

343
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,260
Now they're happy again.

344
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,260
But for how long?

345
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,260
Well, that's the end of the jungle, you guys.

346
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,260
It's cold again.

347
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,260
It's warm in our cages.

348
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,260
What are you afraid here?

349
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,260
Yes, free to have pneumonia.

350
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,260
I'm sorry, but I can't see my husband spending the winter here.

351
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,260
And so all the animals decided to return to the zoo.

352
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,260
Perhaps we'll let you come back next summer, Mrs. Snake?

353
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,260
I like that, when it's warmer.

354
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,260
Hey, look, the animals are on their way back!

355
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,260
All right!

356
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,260
That wonderful!

357
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,260
Oh, it's good to see you.

358
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,260
You don't know how much we missed you.

359
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,260
Oh, good.

360
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,260
Gosh.

361
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,260
We'll come back right now, old fella. It's good to see you.

362
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,260
Come on now, get back to your cages quickly.

363
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,260
We've been keeping them nice and warm for you.

364
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,260
Go on, off you go now.

365
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,260
You look all right, but I'm sure you must all be starving.

366
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,260
We'll do you a special meal tonight, all right?

367
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,260
Ah, the hippos, too.

368
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,260
For the last time, we're movements, not hippos.

369
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,260
You must be cold as well. We'll warm up a cage for you.

370
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,260
It'll be nice and cozy there.

371
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
No.

372
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,260
No, it just came to send the animals off.

373
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,260
Hey, get a cage ready for the hippos.

374
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,260
Well, you're nice and warm.

375
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,260
At the risk of sounding repetitive, we are movements.

376
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,260
Don't be ridiculous, you mullet here.

377
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,260
But we're nothing like hippos.

378
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,260
We know you're not purebred, but the public will never be able to tell.

379
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,260
Do we have to stay here forever, Papa?

380
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,260
Of course not, Momen. Don't worry. I'll think of something.

381
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,260
You will, won't you? Have you got any ideas?

382
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,260
Well, not yet, but I am a writer, you know.

383
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,260
Don't cry, Snorth maiden.

384
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,260
I'm sure there won't be only hay to eat.

385
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,260
I don't mind as long as we're together,

386
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,260
but what if they put us in separate cages?

387
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,260
Well, that would be awful. They wouldn't do that.

388
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,260
Well, perhaps the inspector will come looking for us.

389
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,260
When he realizes that we've gone as well as the animals,

390
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,260
he'll bring the full power of the Lord to bear on them.

391
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,260
Oh, look, there's someone coming.

392
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,260
It's Snorthkin!

393
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,260
And Hamilton!

394
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,260
And a little Mai! Snorthkin!

395
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,260
Hi, Mumen. Don't worry. We'll have you guys out in just a minute.

396
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,260
Please come out.

397
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,260
Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to let you out.

398
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,260
I'm in charge of this zoo. I'm afraid it was quite an understandable mistake,

399
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,260
but please accept this token of apology from the Board of Trustees. Here you are, madam.

400
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,260
Mr. Hemmilan and I went to the Royal Academy of Science just to sort all this out.

401
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,260
We've been given a letter from the President stating that you are not hippos.

402
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,260
Mr. Hemmilan's scientific background helped persuade him,

403
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,260
so you can all come home now.

404
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,260
Well, it just goes to show you must never judge by appearances alone.

405
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,260
Mama!

406
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,260
Yes, Papa.

407
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,260
Do you think I should grow a beard?

408
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,260
No, Papa.

409
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,260
Papa.

410
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:59,260
And so autumn came to Mumen Valley, a new season with different weather and different pleasures.

411
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:12,260
They love the laughter and they love the living and the moments.

412
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:19,260
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

413
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,260
They're always happy and always at play.

414
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,260
The movements are having fun day after day.

415
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,260
The movements.

416
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,260
The movements.

417
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:41,260
They love the laughter and they love the living and the movements.

418
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:48,260
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

419
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,260
They're always happy and always at play.

420
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,260
The movements are having fun day after day.

421
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,260
The movements.

422
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,260
The movements.

423
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:10,260
The movements.

424
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:16,260
The movements.
