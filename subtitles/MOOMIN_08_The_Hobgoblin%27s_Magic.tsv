37440	46240	like a bird sing that song ever there were the moments there were the moments
46240	58240	there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments
76240	88240	there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments
88240	100240	there were the moments there were the moments there were the moments
100240	112240	there you are
112240	122240	oops
122240	132240	we weren't looking where we were going that's all right thank you think of me are you going out
132240	140240	yes for a walk we'll have fun
140240	146240	it seems that thingamy and bob are well and truly part of movement house now
146240	150960	luckily they don't eat a lot and are small enough to find the pencils that fall
150960	158240	between the floorboards in the porch
158240	164240	hey this looks like a great hiding place nobody would ever find it here
164240	168800	come on bob let's go get the suitcase man are you sure it's not safe for an
168800	175800	arm what would you say someone went in when we went there you wouldn't like it would
175800	182800	you I think the movements are much too nice to do anything like that it's not
182800	189800	them it's the guess I'm thinking about you know the movements let anybody stay
189800	196800	snorke maiden you lied to me little my homie
196800	202800	moment still has the shell that I gave him but you said that he didn't impossible
202800	208800	movement mama gave it to the grove I was there when she did it look I saw it he showed it to me
208800	214800	are you really sure was it the same one of course it was I'm not stupid you know
214800	220800	that's very odd I saw her do it with my own eyes well I'll go and ask moving right now
220800	227800	little my it's a bit awkward but if I'm going to be honest snorke maiden what well
227800	232800	I've decided that from now on I'm only going to tell the truth oh yes and I found
232800	237800	something you might be interested in what is it mumble and I were down on the beach
237800	241800	yesterday and you remember all those things we found washed up by the storm do you
241800	246800	mean on the hatty fatter's island that we sailed to yes and do you remember the
246800	251800	figurehead that movement like best of all you know the lady made of wood and
251800	257800	painted she was really lovely wasn't she yes I remember movement wanted to keep it
257800	263800	so what about it well it's here on the beach it was still the same as beautiful
263800	268800	as ever we said the same one yes I remember her pretty face don't legs though
268800	274800	she's just a silly wooden doll oh I know that but she's got those gorgeous eyes and
274800	279800	lovely long hair little my why all this fuss about this silly figurehead
279800	283800	trust him only someone as stupid as movement could fall in love with a figurehead
283800	288800	it's probably still dreaming about her every night do you think it's still there
288800	293800	Jars snorke maiden if no one else has found her already do you think the ocean
293800	298800	might come and wash her away again why all these silly questions snorke maiden
298800	304800	woman would go and rescue her if he knew so that would be terrible I couldn't
304800	310800	bear it at all I really couldn't how pathetic he'll probably take her home
310800	316800	and keep her in his room forever my expect she's too big to go through the door
316800	321800	he'll just sit and stare at her with that lovesick look on his face I know he will
321800	326800	oh where are you going now I thought you were going to move in house I was but
326800	328800	there's something more important I have to do
328800	335800	okay it's clear
344800	350800	hey you two you're not leaving are you no we're just uh we're going
350800	356800	why have you got the suitcase them look woman would you help us with something
356800	365800	of course thank you very much woman oh that's okay it's a bit too big for you to
365800	372800	carry we can take it from here it's all right it's not very heavy
372800	378800	oh silly me it wouldn't be a very secret place if I'd seen it would it I'll see you
378800	383800	later don't be too long now of course I won't
395800	401800	hey what are you doing up there little my I'm coming down what does it look like
401800	406800	you're much too small to do that the rungs are too far apart for you to reach
406800	413800	just you watch me
419800	425360	movement I have a problem do you mind if I ask you something go ahead did
425360	432040	movement mama give snorke means heart shape shell to the grove yes she did so
432040	438040	you and the grove can't both have it can you that's just where you're wrong but
438040	445040	that's simply impossible you can't have the grove simply got another one that's not true
445040	450040	all right but it would only upset snorke made an if she knew so I'm not going to
450040	455040	tell her you rotten thing why don't you just tell me the truth because it's a
455040	461040	secret but I want to know movement look movement now why don't you tell me your
461040	468040	secret and then I'll tell you mine what is it really very top secret go on then tell me
468040	475040	tell me yours first no you tell me first I know let's say them together all right
475040	482040	ready one two three after we go and I went to the beach yesterday I'm out there we'll
482040	489040	make you like it what did you say the figure head by the
489040	496040	K wait a minute you didn't finish telling me your secret I'll tell you later that's
496040	503040	not there you've got to tell me now
512040	528040	what do you think moments to let I don't know maybe he's looking for shells again
528040	538040	I don't think so he looks a bit worried to me maybe he's lost something important
538040	545040	how much further do we have to go as far as you can road where a long way out
545040	550040	already I know I want to make sure that the lady will never turn up again we must go
550040	557040	further out we must be far enough by now I'm tired no the currents could still drag her
557040	561040	in from here keep going
568040	575040	he looks very unhappy we've got to cheer him up but how is only one way Bob yet you're
575040	578040	right thing to me
586040	594040	hello look so sad moment that we thought we try make you happy again

664040	669040	to sapphire blue and then to pink one minute it was like a flame leaping out of the
669040	674040	center then suddenly it was like a blood tulip it was perhaps that's the king's
674040	681040	ruby it was just beautiful that's the one the hob goblin the searching for oh
681040	687040	no however far away is he'll come back on his black panther looking for it and he's
687040	692040	sure to find it because he'll know that thing of me and Bob have it first the
692040	701040	groke and allow the hob goblin what are we going to do no more than a week
701040	714040	later and like a bolt from the blue a real catastrophe hit mumen valley no it's not
