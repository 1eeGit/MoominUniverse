1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Off we go then, Hank is away, he won't have to road too hard, the wind will pick us up soon.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Goodbye, have a good time, everyone.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Goodbye, Snuffkin, now don't forget to shut all the windows if it rains, will you?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Up towards!

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hey! Wait for me, I want to have a good time too!

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hey, wait!

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Look, Snuff is still waving.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
He's a sweet boy.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's keep waving, Moonman, till we're out of sight.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Bye, Snuffkin! Bye, bye!

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Bye!

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No, I'm not waving goodbye, I want to go too!

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Don't eat all the road, Mary Tabo, we're gone!

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's no good shouting little Mai, he can't hear you.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He's giving us a great send-off though, for Snuff, he should have come with us.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Nancy, I'm going off and leaving me here on my own.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Snuffkin, if you wouldn't mind, I think we need some music to send us on our way.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What do you say?

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Are you sure we're on the right course for the island, Papa?

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, the winds with us and the sails are fine.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I bet if we keep this speed up, we'll be there by tomorrow.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well, if the wind stays like this, you could be right.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The wind's not dying down at all.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm surprised, I never thought we'd keep up this speed.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Now make sure you're allergic.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Of course we will be, Papa, if we carry on like this, perhaps we'll see the light from the lighthouse while it's still dark.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, we don't want to hit anything at this speed.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't worry, we're watching.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ah, this is the light.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Papa, the wind's dropped.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, that's strange, it shouldn't happen that quickly.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Do you want us to start rowing, Moomin, Papa?

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No, Snuffkin, I think we'd better get some sleep.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Stupid wind, I really wanted to see the lighthouse at night.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's getting foggy too.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can't even see the stars anymore.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Right, Snuffkin, wake me in two hours and I'll take over.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay, Moomin, Papa.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What's the matter, Little My?

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I thought I heard something.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's coming from over there somewhere.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Can you see anything?

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No, but I can hear it.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's so good eye, and it's getting closer.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Little Moomin, Papa, get up, Moomin!

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Stop it, Little My! What's the matter with you?

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You too, Moomin, quickly, before it's too late!

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What's the matter, Little My?

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I can hear her ship, I can't see it, but it's very close and getting closer.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
A ship? Where?

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Over there, and she's bearing down on us.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Quickly, we don't have much time.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes, by the boobalier right.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We must let them know we're here, a signal.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Right, all hands on deck.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Maybe if we all shout as loud as we can.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Look!

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh!

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Too late for shouting!

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's huge!

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Look out! It's gonna hit us!

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I think Moomin's right, what can we do?

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's too late for anything, just brace ourselves and be ready to swim for it.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Quick, get down, Little My!

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh!

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't believe it!

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Little My!

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Huh?

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's hard, the ship didn't hit us.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh yes, he did!

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What?

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It went straight into our rudder when nothing happened!

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It went right through us!

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Right through us, that's impossible she couldn't have.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I wonder if there was anyone on board that ship.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I can't see any lights.

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I know, Snuffkin, I think it's a ghost ship.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
A ghost ship?

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, there's no wash and no damage to us.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's the only explanation, I think she's right.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
A ghost ship, we've actually seen one.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh dear, oh dear, I need to sit down, all this excitement's too much.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Papa, don't they say that if you see a ghost ship, something terrible is gonna happen to you?

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What happened in the first place to make it become a ghost ship? That's what I wanna know.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, that's just some old sailor's tail, Moomin.

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If it had been a real ship, we'd probably be sinking now.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't you think so, Snuffkin?

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah, I suppose.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's one way of looking at it.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Come on, cheer up you guys, at least it was fun.

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What's the matter?

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Has something happened?

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What are you laughing at?

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What's so funny?

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you going to tell us?

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Why didn't you wake me up, Moomin?

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh!

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, I think we're doing very well.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We're doing very well.

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We're doing very well.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh!

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, I think we're doing very well.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, what a beautiful sky, just look at it.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, the fog is lifting.

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, what's it dozed off?

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Another beautiful day, not a ghost ship in sight.

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The lighthouse.

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey, wake up everybody, the lighthouse.

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I can see the lighthouse we're there.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, the sun shining, we must have slept for hours.

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, there it is.

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is ridiculous.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We've been next to it all night.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We could have gone and slept there.

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I can't wait to go ashore.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
All right, everyone, jump to it.

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Man the old.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There's something strange going on here.

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What is it, Snuffkin?

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm not sure.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Moomin Papa.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Our boat didn't move at all last night, did it?

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No, it doesn't seem to have moved at all.

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So why couldn't we see the light from the lighthouse,

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
even when the fog cleared?

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I can't work it out.

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes, you're right, Snuffkin, it seems very odd.

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We should have seen it.

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Well, perhaps the lighthouse keeper forgot to put it on, Moomin Papa.

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't think so, little Mai.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can't forget a thing like that.

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I suppose it could be broken.

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
There could be lots of reasons for it.

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why don't we hurry up and get ashore,

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and then we can ask the keeper.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Look, there's someone in a boat.

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hmm.

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It looks like he's fishing.

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He know about the lighthouse.

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He probably lives on the island.

142
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's get closer.

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Easy now.

144
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Now, hoi there, good morning.

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Any luck?

146
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Not yet, but it's still early.

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Hmm, yes, quite.

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll ask him straight out.

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Do you know if the lighthouse was working last night?

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't know.

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He said, no, it wasn't.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What did I tell you?

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He forgot to light it.

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, it wasn't only last night.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You'll never see a light in that lighthouse.

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Not even on stormy nights.

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We'll never.

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So what does the keeper do then?

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Nothing.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There is an lighthouse keeper.

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Why?

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm afraid I don't know.

165
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
All I can say is I haven't seen one.

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you live on the island?

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Hey, mister.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You're asking too many questions.

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Who are you?

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm Moment Papa from Moment Valley, and this is my family.

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We've come a long way in order to do some important work here.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
No work on this island.

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No, you better go back home.

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You see, I've come here to research an epic novel about the sea.

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Just turn around and go back.

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're too far from home.

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh, please, wait.

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Shh.

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Dear, don't shout.

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We mustn't scare the fish away.

181
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's go a show and have some breakfast.

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I expect we're all hungry.

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Bunny, pair.

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The old ones lost his marbles.

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The old ones lost his marbles.

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The old ones lost his marbles.

187
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The old ones lost his marbles.

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The old ones lost his marbles.

189
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The old ones lost his marbles.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The old ones lost his marbles.

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Look, Moment Papa. There's a path here leading to the lighthouse.

192
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We'll leave this stuff here and we'll go and explore it first.

193
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Right, to the lighthouse, everyone.

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Up, bow.

195
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Come on!

196
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What's wrong?

197
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Why do you always get so upset when somebody mentions the lighthouse?

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's not your call, sir.

199
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Business boy doesn't concern you at all.

200
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You were like that when I asked you about it before.

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Maybe if you were to tell me, I might be able to understand.

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I could try anyway.

203
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Either talk about something else or keep quiet.

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You understand that?

205
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's so very rocky, I don't think it would work.

206
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What? A garden.

207
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Hello there!

208
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Is there anybody at home?

209
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
There's nobody here.

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That boy was right. It's been empty for ages, I think.

211
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, the door was left unlocked. I know we do it, but most people don't.

212
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Something terrible's happened.

213
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Something terrible! Please, little my, you know I had things like that.

214
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't worry, snort maiden.

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Little my, it's just trying to scare you.

216
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't like hearing about anything horrible.

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Flag your ears then, snort maiden, because I haven't finished yet.

218
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And the next bit's really horrible.

219
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh, well, where have you been finished there?

220
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Well, the lighthouse keeper is still up there.

221
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
He got scurvy and hats and been able to move for months.

222
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And nobody's heard his cries for help.

223
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And with no food, he's almost a skeleton.

224
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If he isn't dead already, he'll be at the top of the stairs, crawling towards his fingers,

225
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
lading and ripped up ribbons and flowers, mouth.

226
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
God, it's endless, mouth.

227
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Shut up, little my.

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's enough.

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It was a good imagination though.

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll let you use it in your book, if you like.

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Come on, tell me what did she say, Moonman?

232
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh, nothing, really. Nothing at all.

233
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Tell me, Moonman, but leave out the bits I wouldn't like.

234
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Where are you going, Papa?

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Well, listen, everyone.

236
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
First, I'm going to get the lamp working.

237
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Then we'll give the place a good clean and then we'll move in.

238
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We'll be the new lighthouse keepers.

239
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And once again, the seas around this island will be safe for ships to navigate in troubled water.

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Come on, Papa!

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Careful, careful.

242
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Touch anything, that's dangerous.

243
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh!

244
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Will Moonman Papa be able to get the light working again?

245
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Where is the lighthouse keeper?

246
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And what could have made him go without locking the door,

247
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
leaving the ships in peril and the seas with no one to guide them away from the rocks?

248
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And who is the mysterious fisherman?

249
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the moments.

250
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

251
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
They're always happy and always at play.

252
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

253
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The movements.

254
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The movements.

255
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

256
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

257
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
They're always happy and always at play.

258
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

259
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The movements.

260
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The movements.

261
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The movements.

262
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Here they are for one and all.

263
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The movements are about to come.

264
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

265
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
They're here for you on your TV.

266
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
They are the movements.

267
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
They are the movements.

268
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So come with me.

269
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Give me your hand.

270
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll take you up to a moment land.

271
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You can fly just like a bird.

272
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Sing that song ever.

273
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
There were the movements.

274
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
There were the movements.

275
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
There were the movements.

276
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
There were the movements.

277
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
There were the movements.

278
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
There were the movements.

279
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:26,840
The movements came to this island to visit a real lighthouse, but when they got there,

280
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:34,840
I found it was completely deserted, no light, and no lighthouse keeper.

281
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Woman Papa is going to try and mend the lamp, and the others are all helping to clean up.

282
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,840
This is it, then. Do you think it's broken, Papa?

283
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:55,840
Well, I'm not sure. I've not had a great deal of experience with this sort of thing.

284
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Look over there, woman. It's the boy and the fisherman from the boat.

285
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,840
They're a bit strange, aren't they?

286
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,840
They must live somewhere here on the island.

287
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,840
Hmm, let's see. Let's see.

288
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Oh, my God.

289
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:28,840
Oh, thank you. Leave it by the door when you haven't quite finished yet.

290
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,840
Well, at least we can see the floor now.

291
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,840
I think the keeper must be lying dead under the dust.

292
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Nobody's cleaned here for a long time, that's for sure.

293
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,840
That probably means the lighthouse lamp hasn't been working for ages either.

294
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,840
I wonder if Papa will be able to fix it.

295
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,840
I wonder if they're going to manage to get the light working all right.

296
00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Well, the lighthouse without a lamp is pretty sad, isn't it?

297
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Come on, light, will you?

298
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,840
Right, I'll give you one last chance.

299
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Then I'm getting the big spanner. Now, you don't know me, but I don't give in easily, especially to machines.

300
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:22,840
Have you thought, brass brain, what will happen tonight if there's a storm and there's a ship out there looking for land or trying to keep off the rocks and there's no light to guide them?

301
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,840
You'll be sorry, Dan, but it'll be too late.

302
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,840
And all I can say is that if the light hasn't been working for some time,

303
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,840
then I'm afraid that there could have been many shipwrecks.

304
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Oh, that's awful.

305
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,840
It would be dangerous to come too close to the island without a light to help you.

306
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,840
I wouldn't be surprised if that ghost ship went one of them.

307
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,840
It all seems very strange, and I wonder what made the lighthouse keeper leave in such a hurry.

308
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,840
Unspeakable horror, please be quiet, little my.

309
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,840
It's obvious.

310
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Close thrown above dishes left unwashed, jigsaw puzzles have finished.

311
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,840
It's an unsolved mystery of the sea, just like the Marie Celeste.

312
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,840
And if you don't understand that, then you're being even stupider.

313
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Then usual.

314
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,840
Oh dear poor man, I wonder what he was like.

315
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,840
He must have been very lonely here on his own.

316
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,840
He scribbled messages over the walls like no side of a ship.

317
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
It's Christmas, another month gone.

318
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,840
I must clean the lamp, and I need to talk to someone.

319
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,840
Oh, well, if he didn't see many ships, at least they could have been many shipwrecks either.

320
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Oh, I hope not Papa.

321
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
That would be one good thing anyway.

322
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Perhaps the sea came and took him on a dark and stormy night, and he was swept out, and no one saw him go.

323
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,840
That's rubbish, little my.

324
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,840
On dark and stormy nights, lighthouse keeper sits safe by a fire drinking hot tea laced with rum.

325
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,840
He might have run out of rum and gone to get more.

326
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,840
Well, I don't think anything terrible happened to him.

327
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,840
He just got more and more lonely and fed up, and then went off and got a girlfriend.

328
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Be careful, snuffkin.

329
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,840
It's very rough and not even, and you don't want to fall into the sea.

330
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,840
I certainly don't.

331
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,840
Now, watch your step. The rocks are very slippery.

332
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,840
Are you alright?

333
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Yes, Lang, so I didn't think they'd be a slippery as all that.

334
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
What's the matter?

335
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
Look over there. There's something moving, but I can't see what it is.

336
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
It's probably a boat.

337
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,840
No, that's what I call a real ship.

338
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,840
It's not a real one.

339
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,840
What do you mean?

340
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,840
It's the ghost ship, the one we saw last night.

341
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,840
You're right. Why isn't it come back snuffkin? What does it want?

342
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,840
I don't know. Perhaps it followed us to the island and for some reason wants to make contact.

343
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Let's go home snuffkin. I don't like this.

344
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,840
What's up?

345
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,840
I'm having a great dream and you can be with me.

346
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Oh, it was horrible. Someone stepped on my face.

347
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
Well, none of us sleep.

348
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,840
We were all asleep. What are you doing?

349
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840
It's very odd.

350
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,840
No, somebody's on my stomach now.

351
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,840
Don't be stupid.

352
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,840
Oh, I have a look snuffkin. There must be something there. Please snuffkin, please.

353
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,840
I can't see any.

354
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
What's that?

355
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,840
What is it?

356
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,840
I don't know yet, movement. I think I can see a pair of feet.

357
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
A pair of feet.

358
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,840
No legs, just feet.

359
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,840
But that means a ghost.

360
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,840
Oh, help! Get it off me! Go away, go away!

361
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Let me at them! Where are they? I'll teach them to spoil my dream!

362
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,840
They're on my face now. Go away, will you?

363
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
Show me it, but no, stamp on it!

364
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
Stop it, move!

365
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
No, it's my foot!

366
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
You go fishing again today?

367
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
No, I'm not.

368
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Oh, do you need me or is it alright if I go and see those people?

369
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,840
In the lighthouse.

370
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
Oh, don't let you want.

371
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Okay, goodbye then.

372
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
You mean this room is really haunted?

373
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
It certainly is.

374
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
But we only saw a pair of feet.

375
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,840
I'll sleep here tonight. Don't worry. I'll protect you.

376
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Are you going to scare it away, Papa?

377
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
Mm-hmm.

378
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840
I can't find any good shells.

379
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
You're me.

380
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
What about this one?

381
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
Oh, yes, that's lovely.

382
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,840
Go on, take it. I don't collect them.

383
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
Who are you?

384
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,840
Well, I'm a ghost, sort of.

385
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
Are you the rat who walked over us last night?

386
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,840
You were lucky I didn't grab you.

387
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
Sorry, it wasn't just me.

388
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
There were a few of us.

389
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
And walk over each other.

390
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
Can I give you a present?

391
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
You can't get around me that easily.

392
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,840
You better show yourselves or you'll be sorry.

393
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,840
It's just me.

394
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,840
The others have all left me and gone off with the ship.

395
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
Ha, so why didn't you go with them?

396
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,840
Oh, I wanted to, but uh, well...

397
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,840
Come on, out with it.

398
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Never got me and left me all of my own and I was frightened.

399
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Well, I can see why they wouldn't want a drippy thing like you around.

400
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
You call yourself a ghost.

401
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,840
No, I'm sorry.

402
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,840
I just can't work out what's wrong with it.

403
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,840
Let's try and see what happens here.

404
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, heavens, oh, my.

405
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Oh, good.

406
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Oh, no, oh, what?

407
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,840
You were right, papa!

408
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,840
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

409
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Quick, open all the windows, I'm choking!

410
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

411
00:25:50,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Mmm, this is great. That soup I've had for ages, Moome and Mama.

412
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
Would you like some more?

413
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,840
Oh, he has, please. Can I have the recipe? I could make some for the fisherman. I know he'd love it.

414
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
I'll write it out for you. What's his name?

415
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,840
I don't know. He doesn't say. I've come from the north. I left about three months ago.

416
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,840
Although it seems a lot longer, and I'd been rowing south in my small boat, trying to reach Moome and Valley.

417
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
Oh, really? We live there.

418
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,840
Do you? You're lucky. It must be very nice. I've never been there, but I've heard that it's beautiful.

419
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Anyway, there was a violent storm in my little boat capsized. He rescued me, and I've stayed with him in his cabin ever since.

420
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,840
And he doesn't talk about himself at all. That's very strange.

421
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,840
No, but I think he does have a big secret.

422
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
How do you know, Toft?

423
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,840
Well, sometimes he just stares and stares at the lighthouse in any sort of size.

424
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
I wonder why.

425
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,840
I did ask him once, but he glared at me in such a nasty way.

426
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
I haven't dared say a word about it since.

427
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840
You don't want to stay with him then?

428
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:10,840
Oh, yes. Well, most of the time he's really nice to me, and since I've been here, I've sort of taken care of him, because you see he doesn't really look after himself.

429
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Can I have a cup of tea, please, Mama?

430
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,840
Yes, dear. How is the light coming along?

431
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Oh, not very well. There's still a few more things I could try, though.

432
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Hello. You were on that boat fishing, weren't you?

433
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,840
Yes, I was. My name is Toft, Mum and Papa.

434
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,840
Oh, please, to meet you. Is your friend here as well? I wanted to ask him something. There's something ever quite important.

435
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
Ask him what?

436
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,840
Well, about this lighthouse for one thing.

437
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,840
Well, he won't talk about that. He just refuses to.

438
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Oh, dear, does he? The thing is, I'm trying to light this beacon, but having no success.

439
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,840
I wondered whether he might know if there's an easy way of doing it. You never know. I haven't missed something.

440
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,840
It's very quiet.

441
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
He might be out fishing, you know.

442
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Come on, let's go.

443
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,840
Where are you going, Moomin?

444
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,840
I want to ask that man some questions.

445
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
He doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who does a lot of talking.

446
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,840
Do you think he might know something about the lighthouse keeper?

447
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,840
That's what I want to find out.

448
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Hello, my name is Moomin, and this is my friend Snuffkin.

449
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,840
What's your business here?

450
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,840
I wonder, do you live here? I suppose you must have met the lighthouse keeper, have you?

451
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
I didn't want people to talk about that.

452
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,840
We were just curious about why you left the lighthouse. Do you know why?

453
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,840
No, he kept himself to himself.

454
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Oh, so you do know it. When did he leave? Where did he go? You must know.

455
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
Get.

456
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Oh, please. Had the light stopped working before he left?

457
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,840
Why did he leave the door open? Were there any shipwrecks?

458
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,840
Oh! Wait a minute. Just one more question, please.

459
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,840
Oh, don't go. There's something very important I need to know.

460
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,840
You're the only other person on the island apart from the go ship.

461
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,840
Oh, please come back. Look, my father is trying to get the lamp working again,

462
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,840
but not getting anywhere. So if you know where the keeper is, or better still,

463
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,840
how to light it when you please help, it's not only for us, but for all those ships

464
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,840
that might be in danger without it.

465
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,840
Moomin.

466
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,840
I don't think that man knows much about anything.

467
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Well, at least he's heard you and knows what you want.

468
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Let's go, Moomin.

469
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Look, over there, what's Moomin Papa doing?

470
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Snork made an a little Maya helping him.

471
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,840
Hiya!

472
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Come on.

473
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Yeah.

474
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,840
It's about time. Where are you two being?

475
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,840
What are you building now? We're making a raft. Why?

476
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,840
Because we wanted to stupid, why else would we build it? Do you like it?

477
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
But why do you want a raft?

478
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
It's not really a raft, is it Papa?

479
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Let me present our very own hand-built ghost ship.

480
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
A ghost ship?

481
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,840
He must be here somewhere.

482
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Well, if he's the one that walked on me last night, I want a word with him.

483
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Yeah, sorry. I'm afraid that was me.

484
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,840
I want a word with him.

485
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Yeah, sorry. I'm afraid that was me and my friends.

486
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
Oh, where are you?

487
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,840
Show us a bit of leg at least. I like to see you I'm talking to.

488
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Yes, all right.

489
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,840
Oh, well, at least he looks like a ghost.

490
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
Thank you.

491
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Ghosts look pretty silly when the sun's shining if you ask me.

492
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Well, it was your idea.

493
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
I always thought ghosts were frightening.

494
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,840
Yes, we forgot our chains last night.

495
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
It's very hard to be ghostly without them.

496
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
We did our best to scare you, though.

497
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,840
The ghost came to this island because a lighthouse was a bit like an ancient castle.

498
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
We feel more at home in castle.

499
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
And now when they found us here, they changed their minds and gave up.

500
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
That's funny, isn't it?

501
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
What's the matter?

502
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
You look a bit fed up.

503
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,840
That's because he's been left behind by the other ghosts.

504
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
They've gone off in the ghost ship.

505
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
Wow, they didn't tell me they were going straight away.

506
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,840
And I'd gone to the lighthouse keepers cabin.

507
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,840
The lighthouse keeper?

508
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
Why did you go there?

509
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Well, I wanted to tell him that some strange people.

510
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
I'm sorry.

511
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,840
I mean, strangers had moved into the lighthouse and that he'd be better off with us

512
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
because ghosts don't damage things.

513
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
I didn't know you then, of course.

514
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
But some people are very kind.

515
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,840
Where is his cabin?

516
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Is it easy to find?

517
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
At the southern end of the island.

518
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,840
But it was a waste of time because he wouldn't talk to me.

519
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
I shouldn't have bothered.

520
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
And then I would have caught the boat.

521
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Anyway, he's not going back to his job, so that's that.

522
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,840
Bye-bye.

523
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
Thanks again for the raft.

524
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
Take care.

525
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,840
I hope you catch up with your friends real soon.

526
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
Thank you.

527
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
You're okay for mortals.

528
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,840
I promise next time we meet Abbey Rally's scurry.

529
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
Chains and all.

530
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,840
Lots of chains and we promise to be terrified.

531
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,840
You can come and scare me anytime you want.

532
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
Bye-bye.

533
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,840
Relating a try.

534
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,840
Bye-bye.

535
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Bye-bye.

536
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,840
He said anything that could float would do.

537
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,840
But that raft seemed a bit flimsy to me.

538
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
I wouldn't like to chance it.

539
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
It can be rough out there.

540
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

541
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Those can't drown.

542
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,840
Can they?

543
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,840
They're dead already.

544
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Mama.

545
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,840
What is it, Mum and Dia?

546
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Papa's gone fishing again.

547
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Well, he enjoys it.

548
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Well, that's all he seems to do these days.

549
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,840
He's not working on the lamp at all.

550
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Well, perhaps living in a new place makes him want to do a new thing.

551
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,840
And he does catch one now and again.

552
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
What are you making, little boy?

553
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,840
An elevator.

554
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
An elevator?

555
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,840
Yes, and when that's finished, I'm going to build a house.

556
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
Oh, my goodness.

557
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,840
A house of my very own.

558
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,840
Mum and Papa doesn't seem his usual happy self,

559
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840
even though he enjoys his fishing.

560
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,840
He's upset that he couldn't make the lamp work

561
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,840
and isn't used to failure,

562
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,840
but nothing he tries makes any difference.

563
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
What a pity it would be to leave the island

564
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,840
without seeing the beautiful beams shining over the water.

565
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,840
What a pity it would be to leave the island.

566
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,840
And when that's finished, I'm going to build a house of my own.

567
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,840
I'll build a house of my own.

568
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
And that's all he's got.

569
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,840
Yeah, hey, coming up along, everyone, I've finished my house.

570
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Ah!

571
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Hey, Mum and Papa!

572
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Come here, the fisherman's coming!

573
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Wow, the fisherman!

574
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Yes, and the boy is with them!

575
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
He's off to his outside?

576
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,840
You don't want to do it, do you?

577
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,840
No, but I gotta do it.

578
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Right!

579
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Here you are.

580
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,840
So, what can we do for you?

581
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,840
Oh!

582
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you!

583
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,840
Hmm?

584
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Tough just told us it's your birthday today, so all the best wishes from us.

585
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,840
My birthday? Is it really?

586
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,840
Excuse me for asking, but how old are you?

587
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
I just don't remember.

588
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,840
It doesn't matter. I'm sorry we don't have any presents.

589
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,840
I haven't had coffee for many, many years.

590
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,840
Bring the barrel, woman mama.

591
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Yes, dear.

592
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Now, let me see. I found this...

593
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
...sawester.

594
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,840
I wonder if it suits me. What do you think?

595
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
Well...

596
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,840
I suppose this must belong to the lighthouse keeper.

597
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Why don't you try it on?

598
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,840
You look good in a sowester. There it suits you.

599
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:08,840
We'd love to know why you left the island and why you didn't come back here.

600
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,840
And also why you didn't like the land.

601
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,840
We really would like to know if you feel you could tell us.

602
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
I was so lonely.

603
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
For years and years.

604
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Then I just went away.

605
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
I'm afraid that's all.

606
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,840
But you did come back. Surely that must mean something.

607
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,840
I knew I'd lived here for too long. Much too long.

608
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,840
You see, I didn't really fit in anywhere else.

609
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:51,840
This is the lighthouse keeper's uniform, isn't it? Why don't you put it on again?

610
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,840
And look, it's nice here. I'd like to stay. Would you mind that?

611
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
I'll stay if you let me.

612
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
Ah, I'd love that.

613
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,840
It'd be fun to see you looking like a lighthouse keeper.

614
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,840
Oh, hooray!

615
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Three days later, the Moomans left the island.

616
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:37,840
They decided to leave at night with the safe blow of the lighthouse beans guiding their path out and away to Mooman Valley.

617
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Mooman Papa had quite forgotten about his epic novel of the sea, but couldn't wait to start again on his memoirs.

618
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,840
The Moomans

619
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:58,840
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomans

620
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:05,840
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomans

621
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:16,840
They're always happy and always at play. The Moomans are having fun day after day. The Moomans

622
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,840
The Moomans

623
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:27,840
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the Moomans

624
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the Moomans

625
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:45,840
They're always happy and always at play. The Moomans are having fun day after day. The Moomans

626
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,840
The Moomans

627
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:55,840
The Moomans

628
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:29,840
Here they are for one and all. The Moomans are about to call. Come on and sit down here with me. They're for you on your TV. They are the Moomans

629
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,840
They are the Moomans

630
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,840
So come with me, give me your hand

631
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,840
I'll take you up to a moment land

632
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,840
You can fly just like a bird

633
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Sing that song ever, there were the Moomans

634
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,840
There were the Moomans

635
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,840
There were the Moomans

636
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,840
There were the Moomans

637
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,840
There were the Moomans

638
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,840
There were the Moomans

639
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,840
Mom

640
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
Everything's so boring

641
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
Let's do something then

642
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:22,840
Like what, for instance, I think we've done everything one could possibly do

643
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,840
None of you three can think of a single thing to do. You're useless, aren't you?

644
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,840
Well, can you think of anything except catching grasshoppers?

645
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,840
There must be something we can do

646
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:40,840
Now we've all had times like this, haven't we? Fortunately, right then, the mailman arrived

647
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,840
Hello, a letter for you

648
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,840
Oh, a letter that must be from my sister for me

649
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,840
Oh no, it's from a woman Papa this time

650
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,840
That's all? Who would write to him? A woman? Someone called Jane?

651
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,840
Huh?

652
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,840
See that he gets it now

653
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Who could this Jane possibly be?

654
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,840
It's your father's old girlfriend, of course

655
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
Never

656
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,840
Oh, I'm sure he had dozens and dozens

657
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,840
Moom and Papa was very kind and handsome young man

658
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,840
A voice from the past

659
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,840
Moom and Papa, liquid, I've got for you

660
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,840
Hmm

661
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,840
Oh, no

662
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,840
I was right

663
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Yeah, you were

664
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,840
Moom and Mama, I think you should go back to the kitchen

665
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
Whatever, for a little lie

666
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,840
Because Moom and Papa store me youth is catching up with him

667
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,840
Please, Papa, tell us it's not that kind of letter

668
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,840
Oh, what would you do?

669
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,840
Don't worry

670
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,840
Whatever it was, it was a long time ago, long before I ever met you

671
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,840
No, it's not that kind of letter

672
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,840
What sort of letter is it then?

673
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,840
Oh, much worse, it's from Aunt Jane

674
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
Who's that?

675
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Mine, my dear, is on my father's side

676
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,840
Oh, how boring

677
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,840
You look very pale suddenly, dear

678
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,840
Yes, because she's coming for a visit tomorrow

679
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:10,840
Oh, don't worry, there's plenty of time for arranging a welcome party

680
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,840
But I don't like her, and I don't want her to come for a visit

681
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,840
Moom and Papa, why not?

682
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,840
Well, you'll soon see, she's very rich

683
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,840
Very rich

684
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,840
Yes, and she bosses everyone, and we won't have a moment of peace

685
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,840
Oh, maybe she's so rich, she'll give us all wonderful presents

686
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,840
Goodness, this is so unexpected, why is she coming here all of a sudden?

687
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,840
Oh, she says she wants to discuss money matters, good heavens with me

688
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,840
She says there's no one else, so you see, I'm in a very difficult situation

689
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,840
Oh, why can't you tell if you're not an expert?

690
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,840
You don't tell Aunt Jane things, she tells you when that's that

691
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,840
Is that what you explained?

692
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,840
When you meet her, you'll know exactly what I mean

693
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,840
What do I know about money matters?

694
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,840
Nothing

695
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,840
Not surprising since we've never had any

696
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,840
How can she expect a poor creature like you to know anything about money?

697
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,840
Also, she's very, very suspicious

698
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,840
And she says money is a terrible burden

699
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,840
Oh, I wouldn't mind shouldering her burden

700
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,840
Maybe you'll inherit it, and then we could share the money

701
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,840
And have a wonderful time together

702
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:40,840
This time, I almost did it

703
00:43:40,840 --> 00:44:10,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

704
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:39,840
I'm sure she jumped at it. Hmm, there'd be no harm in asking, I guess. What's the matter, Mr.

705
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:45,840
Hamilton, you look so unhappy. I'm stuck, that's my problem. How's that?

706
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:56,840
Stuck in my research, this magnifying glass is very good, of course, but I just can't get any further with my botanical research with this old fashioned equipment.

707
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:06,840
What I really need is a microscope and a laboratory. Hmm, and they're expensive, I guess. Yes, they are, and I don't have any money.

708
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:13,840
Well, moment Papa's aunt is coming over tomorrow, and I know she's got any amount of money. Any amount, Sniff?

709
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:24,840
I'll get her to finance you, Hamilton, and we'll get a big greenhouse, and you'll grow orchids and roses and other things, and then we'll sell them, oh, oh, I'll get rich. You too!

710
00:45:36,840 --> 00:46:04,840
Hey, you over there. Hmm, are you talking to me? Of course I am. Who else? I say do you know the way to move in a house young man? Yes, she might say I do. Show me where it is then.

711
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:13,840
Over there, it's tall and blue, just follow that stream and you can't miss it. Good, would you be kind enough to take my suitcase?

712
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,840
I'm sorry I can't, I'm too busy. I'll reward you handsomely for your efforts, think again young man.

713
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,840
But all I want to do is fish. What? You don't want money?

714
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:31,840
I heard you were coming to visit moment Papa, you're a Jane, aren't you?

715
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:37,840
Oh, well, please to meet you, I'm here to take you to moment house. Is this your suitcase?

716
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,840
Wow, this suitcase is very heavy.

717
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,840
Should be, it's full of golden coins.

718
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:53,840
Oh, I'll take care of this. Let's go and take.

719
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:09,840
I can't stay in this house, I don't think I can take Aunt Jane. I'm going to hide out in the cave until she's gone.

720
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:22,840
Bye bye, then dear. Careful now Aunt Jane. The banks have been slippery here and there.

721
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,840
A roundhouse, how stupid, typical of my nephew.

722
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,840
Welcome to moment house Aunt Jane.

723
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,840
Welcome Aunt Jane.

724
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,840
I'd like you to meet us up in a minute.

725
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,840
Please to meet you.

726
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,840
She's very small for a daughter.

727
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,840
Oh little Mai isn't ours, she just lives here.

728
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,840
And I won't get any bigger, either.

729
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,840
Hmm, she's like a member of the family.

730
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,840
And where's my worthless nephew? Why isn't he here?

731
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,840
Oh, well, he's not, is he not at home?

732
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,840
Well, no, when will he be back? I don't know.

733
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,840
He's away looking for inspiration for his work, so he won't be back for a while.

734
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,840
Since when has he worked? I'm here to see him.

735
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,840
Maybe you can see me instead.

736
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,840
What a splendid idea, how clever of you, moment.

737
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,840
Ridiculous, he knows nothing about money.

738
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:30,840
In that case, it is high time he learned. As for his father, I may still disinherit him.

739
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,840
I'm a member of his family, too. I could talk to you about money matters.

740
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,840
Really?

741
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,840
Oh, sniff is a great friend of mine.

742
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,840
Hmm.

743
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,840
But hardly a member of the family.

744
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,840
Hello, moment. And you must be on Jane.

745
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:54,840
I brought my brother to snort with me. He wanted to meet you.

746
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,840
This is Aunt Jane, the nice dog.

747
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,840
Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane.

748
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,840
This is my lovely sister, snort maiden, who is Moomin's special friend.

749
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,840
The snorts and the Moomin's may one day be related.

750
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,840
So in a way, we're all really family.

751
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,840
You maybe, but not to me.

752
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,840
I'm an inventor, and due to an accident, I'm looking around for a sponsor.

753
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,840
A golden opportunity for anyone with some loose capital.

754
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,840
Welcome to Moomin Valley and Jane.

755
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,840
I'm Hemmielin, a botanist of note.

756
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,840
I heard that you might be willing to fund my scientific research, Aunt Jane.

757
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,840
A golden opportunity for anyone with some spare money, eh?

758
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,840
You'd like me to fund your research?

759
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,840
It was my idea.

760
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:46,840
If we built a greenhouse and grow rare orchids and roses, we can make a lot of money.

761
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,840
And you'll make a lot of money.

762
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,840
Young man, I have a lot of money already.

763
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,840
Oh, hasn't sniff discussed this with you, Mom?

764
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,840
Yes, sniff.

765
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,840
Well, I was just getting around to it, Hemmielin.

766
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,840
Confusing?

767
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,840
When I am famous for my botanical research, Aunt Jane, I...

768
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,840
I don't know that will ever happen.

769
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,840
This is very confusing indeed for me.

770
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,840
Now, you're snorkemaid and a friend of Moomin, is that right?

771
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,840
Oh, no, I'm the snorric snort maiden's brother.

772
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,840
I'm a friend of Moomin, Aunt Jane.

773
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,840
Did you really explain about my important research, Sniff?

774
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,840
Did you really explain that I'm a member of the family?

775
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,840
Hey, she got it!

776
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,840
So, Aunt Jane would be grateful to all of you and make you a member of the family.

777
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,840
Thank you, Aunt Jane.

778
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,840
Here's your rule, Aunt Jane.

779
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,840
Oh, I do hope you'll be comfortable here.

780
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,840
Just call if you need anything.

781
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,840
Oh...

782
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,840
Come out.

783
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,840
Here's your suitcase.

784
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,840
It was very heavy.

785
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,840
Thank you.

786
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,840
Hemm...

787
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,840
What is it?

788
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,840
You want a reward?

789
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,840
No, no, Aunt Jane.

790
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,840
I mean, yes, I do, but...

791
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,840
Uh...

792
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,840
Which is it?

793
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,840
Will you make up your mind, young man?

794
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,840
I know where Moomin Papa is right now.

795
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,840
He's a whale and a trip, I know.

796
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,840
No, no. He's somewhere quite near.

797
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,840
Quite near here?

798
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,840
Well, where is he?

799
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,840
Moomin Papa said not to tell you where he's hiding.

800
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,840
It's a secret.

801
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
A secret?

802
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,840
Yes.

803
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,840
I suppose I could tell you, but he'll be very angry.

804
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,840
Where is he? Tell me now.

805
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,840
Well, if I tell you I'm taking a big risk...

806
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,840
Hmm.

807
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,840
Oh, very well.

808
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,840
How much do you want?

809
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,840
I'll leave that to you.

810
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,840
Thank you for the information.

811
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,840
Now you shall have your reward.

812
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,840
Hold out your hand.

813
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,840
Oh, is that all?

814
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,840
Until I've seen him for myself with my own eyes.

815
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,840
Yes!

816
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,840
Huh?

817
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,840
What?

818
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,840
Oh, there's nobody here.

819
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,840
Where is my worthless nephew?

820
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,840
Hey, this is very strange.

821
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,840
You tricked me, haven't you?

822
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,840
Well, no, I swear I would never do that.

823
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,840
You certainly deserve no reward.

824
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,840
Huh?

825
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,840
But no, wait.

826
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,840
If we just look around, we'll find him.

827
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,840
He's in here somewhere I know it.

828
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,840
Hey, Moomin Papa, I got rid of her.

829
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,840
Moomin, Mama.

830
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,840
Yes, Aunt Jane, what is it?

831
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,840
Tell me where my nephew is hiding.

832
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,840
Well, as I said before...

833
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,840
I want to know the truth.

834
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,840
Dear, he's...

835
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,840
Now let me see...

836
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,840
Come on, hurry up.

837
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,840
He's hiding in the cave down by the beach.

838
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,840
I've just been there, Moomin Mama, and I can't find him.

839
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,840
Then he really must have gone away on a trip.

840
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,840
And why should he want to hide from me anyway?

841
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,840
I think he might be a little bit afraid of you.

842
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,840
Afraid of me?

843
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,840
Afraid of his own aunt?

844
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,840
But why?

845
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,840
Mostly he's afraid of money matters.

846
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,840
Incredible.

847
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,840
Afraid of me because of money matters?

848
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,840
He must be utterly mad.

849
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,840
What a family.

850
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,840
I don't understand.

851
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:02,840
It seems that only Smith knows anything about money.

852
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,840
I know where Moomin Papa is right now.

853
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,840
So you want some of my gold, who do you young lady?

854
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,840
I couldn't care less about your silly gold.

855
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,840
My silly gold indeed.

856
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:17,840
With silly gold, I assure you you can do just anything you want.

857
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:22,840
Seems to me your silly gold doesn't even help you to find Moomin Papa.

858
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,840
Hmm?

859
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,840
I think you should forget about your money.

860
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,840
Young lady, money isn't something you can just forget about.

861
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,840
It needs constant looking after.

862
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,840
That's why I must talk to Moomin Papa at once.

863
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,840
Now take me to that rascal nephew of mine.

864
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,840
If you really know where he is, do you hear me?

865
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,840
Do you have me?

866
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,840
Of course.

867
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,840
Oh wow, frivolous.

868
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,840
Not really.

869
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:52,840
If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too.

870
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,840
Oh well, Frederick and I were frivolous once.

871
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Really?

872
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,840
Of course.

873
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,840
Oh wow, frivolous.

874
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,840
Not really.

875
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,840
If I could find a small enough boyfriend, I'd be frivolous just like them too.

876
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,840
I'd be frivolous once.

877
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,840
Really?

878
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:08,840
If you say so, I suppose I have to believe you.

879
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,840
Huh?

880
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
Look.

881
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
What?

882
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,840
Little May and Anne Jane walking together.

883
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,840
What are they doing?

884
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,840
Little May is plotting something.

885
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,840
Really?

886
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,840
Moomin?

887
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:33,840
Sniffs are right, really.

888
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,840
But sometimes he just can't withstand the lure of gold.

889
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,840
Check me.

890
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,840
No.

891
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,840
Well you can't be right.

892
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,840
Let's go back then.

893
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,840
Fine, just take your time.

894
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,840
Hi guys.

895
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,840
Little May, what's the matter?

896
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,840
We have a guest.

897
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,840
A guest?

898
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,840
Hmm.

899
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,840
Move it, Papa.

900
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,840
What?

901
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,840
Move it, Papa.

902
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,840
Oh, so?

903
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,840
This is where you've been hiding.

904
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,840
Oh, what else?

905
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,840
Wait.

906
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,840
Oh, I'm here to shoot you.

907
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,840
I'm here to save your friend.

908
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,840
Wait, Jane.

909
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,840
No, you wait.

910
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,840
What are you worst?

911
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,840
Wait, please.

912
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,840
Moomin, Papa, was sort of on his way back from a trip

913
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,840
and then stopped by to play chess with me.

914
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,840
Yes.

915
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,840
Exactly.

916
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,840
No, yes.

917
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,840
Moomin, Mama told you the truth.

918
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,840
Oh, I sort of stopped by.

919
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,840
Why are you so afraid of me, young man?

920
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,840
Well, I'm not, not really.

921
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,840
I mean, it's not you.

922
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,840
It's your money.

923
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,840
I'm afraid of it.

924
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,840
Really scared.

925
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,840
Scared of my money?

926
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,840
Well, I'm not.

927
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,840
It's perfectly good money and all in gold coins.

928
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,840
Listen, nephew.

929
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,840
I'm depending on you as my only relative.

930
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,840
Yes, yes.

931
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,840
Please depend.

932
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,840
When I get too old to do it,

933
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,840
you must look after my gold for me.

934
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,840
I'm relying on you.

935
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,840
No, that's not possible.

936
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,840
I know, and Jane, we can give it all away.

937
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,840
Must be those who'd love to have it.

938
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,840
Must be those who need it more than we do.

939
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,840
Oh, a green pearl.

940
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,840
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

941
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,840
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

942
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,840
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

943
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,840
She's crazy.

944
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,840
Don't worry.

945
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,840
We'll think of something.

946
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,840
Oh, you would throw my money away without a cut.

947
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,840
Why didn't you mean to hurt you, Aunt Jane?

948
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,840
I know.

949
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,840
Let's put it all in the bank.

950
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,840
Money likes being in the bank.

951
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,840
My money would hate being in a bag.

952
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,840
It could be a terrible idea.

953
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,840
Oh, no.

954
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,840
Banks are so nice nowadays.

955
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,840
They are.

956
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,840
Of course, they have flowers and shiny piggy banks

957
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,840
and pretty paintings on the wall.

958
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,840
Is that really true?

959
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,840
Right.

960
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,840
Come on, everybody.

961
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,840
Let's hurry home and fix a welcoming party for Aunt Jane.

962
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,840
A party?

963
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,840
Yes, any reason is good enough.

964
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:27,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

965
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,840
This was Grandma's best cake recipe.

966
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,840
Welcome at Jane.

967
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,840
Let's drink a toast to the only millionaire

968
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,840
in our small circle.

969
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,840
May she live a long and healthy life.

970
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,840
Cheers!

971
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,840
Cheers!

972
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,840
Cheers!

973
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:52,840
Now, this is your welcoming party at Jane.

974
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,840
What's the matter?

975
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,840
Never in my life of I and my money

976
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,840
felt ourselves as welcome before.

977
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,840
I'm so happy I could cry.

978
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,840
Oh, and once you start crying,

979
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,840
you just want to go on.

980
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,840
Not again.

981
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,840
Please don't be unhappy at Jane.

982
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,840
Don't cry.

983
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,840
Dear.

984
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,840
Oh, dear.

985
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,840
Mom and Papa.

986
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,840
Mom and Papa.

987
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,840
Yes, Aunt Jane.

988
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,840
What is it?

989
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,840
I'll put some of my gold in a bank,

990
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,840
but you must look after the rest when I'm too old.

991
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,840
Oh, hmm.

992
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,840
And why not?

993
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,840
All right.

994
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,840
We'll keep it in the cellar

995
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,840
and make a nice little niche for it with seashells and moss.

996
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,840
And I'll have someone go down and look at it every week.

997
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,840
Don't you worry, Aunt Jane.

998
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,840
Your money will be in safe hands.

999
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,840
Not quite, but I had in mind.

1000
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,840
I know.

1001
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,840
But I suppose it can't be helped.

1002
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,840
It sounds rather nice.

1003
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,840
A cozy little niche down in the cellar.

1004
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,840
And if you take a look every week,

1005
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,840
but oh, dear, it will miss me.

1006
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,840
Oh, Aunt Jane.

1007
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,840
Very well.

1008
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,840
I have made up my mind.

1009
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,840
I'm leaving this sink.

1010
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,840
It's with you now.

1011
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,840
So you and my gold can get sturdy used to each other.

1012
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,840
Do what you want with it.

1013
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,840
Your friends seem to have ideas about how to spend it.

1014
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,840
Flying ships and botanical research sound rather splendid.

1015
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,840
Oh, dear.

1016
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,840
I'm so happy for you.

1017
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:16,840
Darn.

1018
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,840
I should have let us up better than flowers.

1019
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,840
So ended the visit of the dreaded Aunt Jane.

1020
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:32,840
And I'm sure Sniff will be able to think of some other use for the gold.

1021
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:41,840
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

1022
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:49,840
You're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1023
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:53,840
They're always happy and goes at play.

1024
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:57,840
The movements are having fun day after day.

1025
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,840
The movements.

1026
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:04,840
The movements.

1027
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:10,840
The movements.

1028
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:36,840
Here they are for one and all.

1029
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,840
The movements are about to come.

1030
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,840
Come on and sit down here with me.

1031
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,840
They're here for you on your TV.

1032
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,840
They are the movements.

1033
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,840
They are the movements.

1034
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,840
So come with me, give me your hand.

1035
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,840
I'll take you up to a movement land.

1036
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,840
You can fly just like a bird.

1037
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,840
Sing that song ever!

1038
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:05,840
There were the movements.

1039
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,840
There were the movements.

1040
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,840
There were the movements.

1041
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,840
There were the movements.

1042
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,840
There were the movements.

1043
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:22,840
There were the movements.

1044
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:43,840
One day in Newman Valley, not long before mid-summer on a perfectly ordinary day, Snuffkin suddenly announced that he was going on a short trip.

1045
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,840
Where are you going, Snuffkin?

1046
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:51,840
Well, not very far. I'll be back right after mid-summer.

1047
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,840
Oh, but Snuffkin, you'll miss the bonfire at the big party.

1048
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,840
But why in the world are you going away?

1049
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:03,840
There's something I've been dying to do for a long time, and it has to be done on mid-summer eve.

1050
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:10,840
I promise to tell you all about it, Moonman, as soon as I'm back in Moonman Valley.

1051
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:20,840
Little did Snuffkin know that before he came back, the underwater volcano, which had kept quiet ever since Moonman Papa's youth, would wake up again.

1052
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:38,840
What's all that smoke? Is it the volcano and your father's memoirs?

1053
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:45,840
I don't think I like this.

1054
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:49,840
I think it's exciting. In that case, you can have it.

1055
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,840
Moonman Mama.

1056
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,840
Yes, what is it, dear?

1057
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:57,840
This hammock is shaking. It's very unpleasant.

1058
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:00,840
I think it's that volcano you told us about.

1059
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,840
Yes, I guess it must be.

1060
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,840
Mama! Papa!

1061
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:05,840
Oh!

1062
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,840
There's smoke rising from the sea, Papa!

1063
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,840
Smoke!

1064
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,840
Oh, that's very odd.

1065
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:22,840
What is it, Papa?

1066
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,840
Let me see!

1067
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:29,840
What's going on?

1068
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,840
I don't know, really. I guess there isn't much we can do.

1069
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,840
I can't see.

1070
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,840
Where is it?

1071
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,840
Let me see now. It's my turn.

1072
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,840
No, I'm at first.

1073
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,840
Yes, no, I've got it.

1074
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,840
Oh, I'm clean. Let me see.

1075
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,840
No, I'm at first.

1076
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,840
Moonman Papa, will the Earth quakes as big in your youth?

1077
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,840
No, they certainly weren't. And this one's underwater.

1078
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,840
Oh, my net cause a tide of waves?

1079
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,840
A tide of waves, oh my goodness, I've never thought of that.

1080
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,840
Hey, what's your turn?

1081
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,840
Snatch me the net.

1082
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,840
What do you think? Can you see anything unusual, Moonman Papa?

1083
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,840
I've never seen anything like it. This is very unusual.

1084
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,840
Oh my, I want to see it too.

1085
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,840
How can you bite during a catastrophe?

1086
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:25,840
Whatever you do, don't rip the top off with you.

1087
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,840
You're so stupid, you should have let me have it first.

1088
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,840
It's all your fault little my, anyone can see that.

1089
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,840
How dare you say it was all my fault.

1090
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,840
Oh.

1091
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,840
Snork maiden?

1092
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:53,840
Yes.

1093
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:57,840
I'm standing watch over my flying ship, so why don't you stay over in Moomin House?

1094
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,840
You'd be careful.

1095
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,840
You look after her, won't you, Moonman Papa?

1096
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,840
Certainly, Snork. I don't like the look of things.

1097
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:08,840
No, do I. No, do I. We better get inside, Moonman, house quickly.

1098
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,840
Yes.

1099
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,840
It's scary.

1100
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,840
Yeah, the earthquake started.

1101
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,840
The earthquake started.

1102
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,840
Oh.

1103
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:36,840
What's that noise? Listen, can you hear?

1104
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,840
A noise? What noise?

1105
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,840
I don't know. It sounds like water to me.

1106
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,840
Oh no!

1107
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:51,840
What's happened, Moomin House is drifted off to sea.

1108
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,840
I don't believe this.

1109
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,840
I think Moomin Valley is flooded. It really is.

1110
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:07,840
What's happened to the kitchen and dining room?

1111
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,840
Just because I fear.

1112
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,840
What are we going to do?

1113
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:14,840
Moomin Mama can't even prepare breakfast down there.

1114
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,840
Oh, good morning. You're up early today.

1115
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,840
Mama, Moomin House is flooded.

1116
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,840
All of Moonman Valley is under water.

1117
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,840
Oh, dear. I think you're right, Moomin.

1118
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,840
It's Papa's still asleep.

1119
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,840
Let's go and wake him up. He definitely wouldn't want missed it.

1120
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,840
Boy, I'm sleepy.

1121
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,840
I'm even asleep here.

1122
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,840
I didn't sleep a wink because he was snoring.

1123
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,840
Little my was snoring so hard the whole bed was shaking.

1124
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:42,840
I'm going to have a nap as soon as I've had something to eat.

1125
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,840
Hey, snap.

1126
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:48,840
What's this? Where am I? What's happened here?

1127
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,840
Moomin House is flooded, sniff.

1128
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,840
This means I'll have to swim to get home.

1129
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,840
You'll have to dive to get into your house.

1130
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,840
Unless I'm mistaken, the water is still rising.

1131
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:04,840
Moomin Papa, you've got to do something. Do something right away.

1132
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,840
I think you better start taking swimming lessons.

1133
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,840
And don't worry, sniff. I'll start organizing.

1134
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,840
What do you want to organize, Moomin Mama?

1135
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,840
Well, dear, I guess we should have some breakfast first of all.

1136
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,840
Yes.

1137
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,840
But how do we get into the kitchen, Papa?

1138
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,840
You just leave that to me.

1139
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:27,840
There, your kitchen.

1140
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,840
I've never seen it from above before.

1141
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,840
Oh, my goodness.

1142
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:36,840
People should look at their rooms from above once in a while.

1143
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:40,840
Look, cars of food floating from the cellar.

1144
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,840
What luck we have a trap door.

1145
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,840
Mama, shall I dive in and get them?

1146
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:46,840
Yes, please, Moomin.

1147
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:50,840
Be careful, Moomin. It's got to be done.

1148
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,840
Hurry up, Moomin. I'm hungry.

1149
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,840
Could you get us some bowls and plates this time?

1150
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:13,840
Sure.

1151
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,840
And indeed, the water was still rising.

1152
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,840
It's coming. It's coming. Help!

1153
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,840
The water's up to the third floor.

1154
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,840
What are we going to do, Moomin, Papa? Where's Moomin, Papa?

1155
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,840
He's up on the roof, sniff, with the others.

1156
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,840
What are they doing up on the roof?

1157
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,840
Ah, there goes another poorly built house.

1158
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,840
Why doesn't our house float away, Papa?

1159
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,840
It's all very simple, dear son. I've built it myself.

1160
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,840
If you hadn't, maybe we wouldn't be about to sink altogether.

1161
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,840
Here we are.

1162
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,840
Are you coming to help me, everybody?

1163
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,840
This is one of Grandma's best plates, so please be extra careful.

1164
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,840
I know. But where do you think we're going, Mama?

1165
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,840
Something will float by. Big enough to take all of us. We just have to wait.

1166
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,840
I'm not going to wait for that. I think this family's out in touch with reality.

1167
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,840
Something big enough will float by indeed, huh?

1168
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,840
I'm going to sink my old skin while I'm still tired.

1169
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:26,840
This is something I should have done immediately, but it's not too late.

1170
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,840
Look, there's a whole house drifting by.

1171
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,840
Oh, you're right. It's very odd looking house, though.

1172
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,840
Yes, it does look funny, but I think we'd better take it.

1173
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,840
Hmm. That's the one we're getting.

1174
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,840
Somebody help me!

1175
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,840
Wait, stop! I'm coming with you!

1176
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,840
Don't leave me behind!

1177
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,840
Where's that house?

1178
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,840
Right over there. Just there. Can't you see it, Snapp?

1179
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,840
Oh, that house. What? You call that a house?

1180
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,840
Come on.

1181
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,840
Hurry up, Snapp. What are you doing?

1182
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,840
I just changed my mind. That one looks like it's going to sink.

1183
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,840
No, it's fine. We're all aboard. Come on.

1184
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,840
I don't believe you. As soon as I'm aboard, it'll sink. I can feel it.

1185
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,840
He's scared of his own shadow. Let's leave him. Move any such a whimp.

1186
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,840
Come on. It's all right.

1187
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,840
Now, don't worry about me. You can let go of the ladder. I'm fine.

1188
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,840
Stay behind if you like, Snapp. But what about your breakfast?

1189
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:52,840
We have all the food here, and you might get hungry, and if you do, there'll be nothing to eat.

1190
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,840
Why didn't you say so before?

1191
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:00,840
Now, hold the ladder, Snapp. I don't want to be abandoned.

1192
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:06,840
No, brother. He's kind of making you know what it is that he actually ever followed.

1193
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm falling off your back.

1194
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,840
I'm falling. Don't do the same after all.

1195
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,840
Don't shake it.

1196
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,840
Don't shake it. Hold the steady.

1197
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,840
Excuse us. Hello, anybody home.

1198
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,840
Don't worry. We're not dangerous.

1199
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,840
You isn't breakfast ready yet. I'm starving to death.

1200
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,840
There's no one here, Papa.

1201
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,840
I think you're right. It certainly seems empty.

1202
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,840
Oh, and the most exciting empty house I've ever seen.

1203
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:48,840
Why do you say that? What do you mean exciting? Do you mean interesting or do you mean scary little my?

1204
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,840
Interesting and scary. Look, Snorgmaiden. Look around.

1205
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,840
Oh, what a lot of mirrors.

1206
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,840
This house must have been full of women who loved clothes.

1207
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:03,840
Or maybe just one woman Snorgmaiden who had as many faces as there are mirrors in this room.

1208
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,840
I don't like that. Look, every mirror has a chair in front of it.

1209
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,840
Place just like so.

1210
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,840
This house was full of ladies and he chatted her a little mirror.

1211
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:23,840
Thank goodness we brought some plates with us.

1212
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,840
Woman, woman, woman. Look what I found. Bread and apples.

1213
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,840
How nice, sniff. Now we can have a real breakfast.

1214
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,840
But where is everybody?

1215
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:38,840
Well, I don't know. Somewhere around.

1216
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,840
Whoever lived here must have had a lot of strange hobbies.

1217
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,840
You're so right.

1218
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,840
Hey, who said that?

1219
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:55,840
Wow, look at that cog wheel. This snork would love that.

1220
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,840
I wonder what woman will say about this little my?

1221
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:03,840
I'm sure he'll say you look better without anything.

1222
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,840
One look at you and he won't even notice anything else.

1223
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:10,840
Well, if he has any sense, he will fall for me like a ton of bricks.

1224
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,840
You want about breakfast, woman, mama?

1225
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,840
We'll have breakfast as soon as we are all here.

1226
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,840
I wonder where they can all be.

1227
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,840
You know, it's very bad for me to go hungry. I always feel unwell if I don't eat.

1228
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,840
All right, sniff. You go ahead. But mind you don't eat all the apples.

1229
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,840
Leave some for the others, won't you?

1230
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,840
Oh, don't worry. Of course I will, mom and mama.

1231
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,840
This is an apple.

1232
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,840
Oh, but where on earth did you find them, sniff?

1233
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,840
In a football.

1234
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,840
But normal trick to play on people making false fruit.

1235
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,840
I'm very upset.

1236
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,840
Oh, this is not bread.

1237
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,840
Oh.

1238
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,840
Who could have done such a cruel thing to me?

1239
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,840
Somebody with a very art sense of humor, I'd say.

1240
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,840
Somebody without anything.

1241
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,840
Have some cheese instead. That at least comes from moving valley.

1242
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,840
And it looks delicious.

1243
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,840
Whatever these levers for.

1244
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,840
What's that hear you sound? It's creepy.

1245
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,840
Can't you hear it? It sounds like a new earthquake.

1246
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,840
Yes, I can hear it.

1247
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,840
It's scary and spooky and creepy. All you have to try to be on my mind.

1248
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:42,840
Oh, I wonder what it can be. It's very strange indeed.

1249
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,840
I just don't think I can take another earthquake right now.

1250
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,840
Oh, my goodness. Oh, look. What is it, sniff?

1251
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,840
Last moment, mama.

1252
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,840
Why? Our table is gone.

1253
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,840
This is a haunted mansion, mom and mama.

1254
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:02,840
Well, they can't take grandma's plates just like that.

1255
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,840
You can have the plates back, but I'll keep the cheese.

1256
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,840
I like cheese.

1257
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,840
This is good cheese, dad.

1258
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,840
Yes, I certainly did.

1259
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,840
Better not let our food out of sight.

1260
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,840
Let's get out of this house, please, mom and mama.

1261
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,840
What's this?

1262
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,840
What's happening?

1263
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,840
Oh, we'll have to get out of here.

1264
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:27,840
What?

1265
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:28,840
What?

1266
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:29,840
What?

1267
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,840
What?

1268
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:31,840
What?

1269
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:32,840
What?

1270
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,840
What?

1271
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,840
What?

1272
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,840
Papa, was it the witch who was laughing?

1273
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,840
No.

1274
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,840
The laughter is coming from that ugly one.

1275
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,840
Be behind there.

1276
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,840
Did I hear someone call me an ugly thing just now?

1277
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,840
Oh, excuse us, madam.

1278
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,840
You must be the owner of this house.

1279
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:17,840
No.

1280
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,840
Oh?

1281
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,840
Indeed I am not.

1282
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:21,840
Most certainly not.

1283
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:22,840
You are greatly mistaken.

1284
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:25,840
This is no house you fool. This is a theater.

1285
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:26,840
A theater?

1286
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:27,840
Yes.

1287
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,840
This is a stage where the heroin receives a standing ovation

1288
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,840
at the end of the last act.

1289
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,840
And the bread and the apples are props.

1290
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,840
And the rumour you are playing is where the actors make themselves

1291
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,840
up to become totally different people.

1292
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,840
Kings are murderers.

1293
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,840
Oh, and you are one of these actors?

1294
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,840
An actress.

1295
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,840
You understand less than nothing.

1296
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,840
See this brum here?

1297
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,840
This is my only prop.

1298
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,840
I sweep the dust in this theater.

1299
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:54,840
Oh, really?

1300
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,840
I have wielded this brum for nearly 20 years.

1301
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,840
Would nobody to help me?

1302
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,840
20 years I have cleaned this theater beautifully.

1303
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,840
My name is Emma.

1304
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,840
Emma?

1305
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:07,840
And you?

1306
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,840
You better remember that this is at the theater.

1307
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,840
This is no ordinary house.

1308
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:15,840
And it is a great honor for you to be here at all.

1309
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:16,840
That's true.

1310
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,840
Does this mean that we can stay here just for a while?

1311
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,840
Yes, until the actors return.

1312
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,840
Today they all came to a low-verset.

1313
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,840
Wow!

1314
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,840
That's really cool.

1315
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,840
Yes, it certainly is.

1316
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,840
We'll try not to bother you, Emma.

1317
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,840
Hey you!

1318
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,840
Come on, get in the way!

1319
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,840
Get out, get in the way!

1320
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,840
Get in the way!

1321
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,840
Get in the way!

1322
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,840
You're white.

1323
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,840
Woohoo!

1324
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,840
Woohoo!

1325
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,840
Woohoo!

1326
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,840
Woohoo!

1327
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:56,840
Oh!

1328
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,840
Woohoo!

1329
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,840
Woah.

1330
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,840
Well, what have you done?

1331
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,540
We seem to have hit a tree, so the house has stopped.

1332
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:08,640
This is a theater not a house!

1333
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,040
Oh, it's a Rowan tree.

1334
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:15,540
How lovely it looks, how nice to have crashed into such a beautiful tree.

1335
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,140
It's gorgeous!

1336
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:18,740
And that smell.

1337
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:19,740
You know what?

1338
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:22,740
I'd like to spend the night in that great idea, Moon.

1339
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:25,240
I'm coming with you, how exciting!

1340
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:29,240
You better stay here, you're bound to fall into the water.

1341
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,040
Look who's talking!

1342
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,440
Scary cat!

1343
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,740
That looks safe.

1344
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:35,540
We could easily spend the night here.

1345
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:39,640
We better tie the theater to the tree, so it won't drift away.

1346
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,640
If that's all right with Emma.

1347
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:45,040
Emma, is it all right to tie the theater to the tree?

1348
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,140
Do what you want, as long as you don't damage the theater to get here?

1349
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,140
All right.

1350
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,840
Don't whistle, you idiot!

1351
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,040
Don't ever whistle in a theater!

1352
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,240
That's the worst luck possible!

1353
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:00,340
How dare you!

1354
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:01,340
Oh!

1355
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:16,140
This is great snorkemaiden.

1356
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,840
We can look at the moon.

1357
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,140
And the flowers, they smell so good.

1358
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:24,140
What's the matter?

1359
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:26,140
I hope that snorke's all right.

1360
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:27,240
Don't you worry.

1361
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:31,340
He was standing guard over a flying ship after all.

1362
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:34,340
All you have to do is get on board and fly away.

1363
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,240
What's going on here?

1364
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,240
Huh?

1365
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,240
Hmm.

1366
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:07,240
Ah!

1367
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,240
No, they're trying to destroy the pamphor's box.

1368
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,240
I've never seen anything like it!

1369
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:14,240
These people are bunch of vandals!

1370
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:15,240
Ugh!

1371
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,240
Ugh!

1372
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:44,240
Meanwhile, movement and snorkemaiden are fast asleep, blissfully unaware of what was happening.

1373
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:48,240
But whatever will they do, stranded on the treetop.

1374
01:22:48,240 --> 01:23:00,240
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

1375
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:08,240
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1376
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:12,240
They're always happy and goes at play.

1377
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,240
The movements are having fun day after day.

1378
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:18,240
The movements.

1379
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:22,240
The movements.

1380
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:27,240
The movements.

1381
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:54,240
Here they are for one and all.

1382
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:57,240
The movements are about to come.

1383
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,240
Come on and sit down here with me.

1384
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:03,240
They're here for you on your TV.

1385
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,240
They are the movements.

1386
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,240
They are the movements.

1387
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:12,240
So come with me, give me your hand.

1388
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:15,240
I'll take you up to a movement land.

1389
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:18,240
You can fly just like a bird.

1390
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,240
Sing that song ever.

1391
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,240
There were the movements.

1392
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:26,240
There were the movements.

1393
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,240
There were the movements.

1394
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:32,240
There were the movements.

1395
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:35,240
There were the movements.

1396
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:39,240
There were the movements.

1397
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,240
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1398
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:59,240
Women and snorknaten were still fast asleep in the row and tree.

1399
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:04,240
The sun was high in the sky and the floating theater had floated away a long time ago.

1400
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,240
Oh, I feel so good.

1401
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:10,240
I really slept like a log all night.

1402
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:16,240
It's so lovely to be out in the fresh air with moon and a tree in blue.

1403
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:20,240
No! No!

1404
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,240
The house is gone!

1405
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:25,240
I mean, the theater is gone!

1406
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:28,240
What?

1407
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:31,240
No! The house is gone!

1408
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,240
I mean, the theater is gone!

1409
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,240
Moomin!

1410
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,240
Wake up, Moomin! Wake up!

1411
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:40,240
There's been a catastrophe! Wake up!

1412
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,240
What's a catastrophe?

1413
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,240
Look down!

1414
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:46,240
The theaters floated off during the night.

1415
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:49,240
I don't believe it.

1416
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,240
It has!

1417
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,240
It's gone!

1418
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,240
I can't see it anywhere.

1419
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,240
It must be far away by now.

1420
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,240
Moomin, your father's walking stick!

1421
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:10,240
Huh?

1422
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:15,240
It must have gotten loose in the middle of the night while everybody was asleep.

1423
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,240
Crying won't solve the problems don't made him.

1424
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:27,240
But we're stranded in the row and tree with water all around us.

1425
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:30,240
No!

1426
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,240
We're floating away!

1427
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,240
We're drifting away!

1428
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:58,240
Oh!

1429
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,240
What are we going to do?

1430
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:04,240
Moomin and Snorkmaiden are still up in that beautiful row and tree.

1431
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:06,240
That's just typical.

1432
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,240
Where is it?

1433
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,240
And how can we have drifted so far away?

1434
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,240
He was the last night, didn't you?

1435
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:15,240
I told you never to do that in a theater and brings bad luck.

1436
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:18,240
Oh, never.

1437
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,240
What?

1438
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:23,240
Oh!

1439
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:25,240
No!

1440
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,240
Stop it!

1441
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,240
Backer to heaven!

1442
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,240
Let's go upstairs!

1443
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:30,240
Stop it!

1444
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,240
Oh!

1445
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:32,240
Oh!

1446
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,240
Little Mai!

1447
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:37,240
Oh, no!

1448
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,240
Oh, no!

1449
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,240
That was me!

1450
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,240
Oh, dear!

1451
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,240
Oh, little Mai!

1452
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:44,240
Oh, get this hurry!

1453
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,240
You're so mean!

1454
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:49,240
Little Mai is drifting off!

1455
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:52,240
Scenes were stranded and that's not a bad thing.

1456
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,240
There shouldn't swim about like that.

1457
01:27:54,240 --> 01:28:04,240
I'm too scared to get over to your side!

1458
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,240
You must be brave, Snorkmaiden!

1459
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:09,240
I'll catch you so you won't fall, okay?

1460
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:19,240
I told you so, the branch didn't break, did it?

1461
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,240
Thank you for saving me!

1462
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,240
Ah!

1463
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,240
Ah!

1464
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,240
Ah!

1465
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,240
Ah!

1466
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:26,240
Ah!

1467
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,240
Ah!

1468
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,240
Ah!

1469
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,240
Are you all right, Newman?

1470
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,240
I can stand up, Snorkmaiden!

1471
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,240
Look, the water's only ankle deep!

1472
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,240
Really?

1473
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,240
Ah!

1474
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:37,240
Ah!

1475
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,240
Ah!

1476
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:39,240
Ah!

1477
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,240
Ah!

1478
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:43,240
Are you all right, Snorkmaiden?

1479
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,240
Yes, it's so shallow!

1480
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:52,240
I wonder where I'm going to end up.

1481
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:55,240
It doesn't matter, I rather like this boat.

1482
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:56,240
I'm going to make some noise.

1483
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:59,240
I'll go back to sleep for a while.

1484
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:08,240
It's getting dark, isn't it?

1485
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:09,240
Oh?

1486
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:15,240
Yes, dry land!

1487
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,240
Look there!

1488
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:18,240
A fire!

1489
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,240
Must be people over there.

1490
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,240
Yes!

1491
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:39,240
Of course, I've forgotten tonight's mid-summer eve!

1492
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:53,240
What?

1493
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:06,240
What a strange catch!

1494
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,240
So the movements have split up.

1495
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,240
Are they in trouble, little Mai?

1496
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:19,240
Yeah, seems I was probably the luckiest one as usual.

1497
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,240
Mark!

1498
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:24,240
I'm sorry you can't have anymore, that's all I have.

1499
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:27,240
I don't believe you, your bag's still full.

1500
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,240
Yes, but not with food, little Mai.

1501
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,240
What's in it then?

1502
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,240
You'll soon find out.

1503
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:37,240
Where are we going?

1504
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,240
To a park.

1505
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,240
I hope there's a hot dog stand there.

1506
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,240
Those two over there are the park keeper and his wife.

1507
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:54,240
Look, they're always watching.

1508
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:58,240
They guard a lot of poor orphans who come to the park every day.

1509
01:30:58,240 --> 01:30:59,240
Really?

1510
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:00,240
Look over there!

1511
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:05,240
Unbelievable!

1512
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:22,240
Hey, what's this?

1513
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,240
Hey kids!

1514
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,240
Come on everybody, we're here to let you out.

1515
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,240
Come quickly, hurry!

1516
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,240
What?

1517
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:40,240
We can't go anywhere.

1518
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,240
We have to sit right here so they can see us.

1519
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,240
Yeah, otherwise they might lose one of us.

1520
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:48,240
What a lot of signs, no walking on grass.

1521
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,240
No shouting, no running.

1522
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:53,240
What a lot of rules.

1523
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,240
What are they good for, Snuffkin?

1524
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:56,240
Nothing.

1525
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:57,240
Nothing at all.

1526
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,240
And that's why we're going to pull them up.

1527
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:01,240
No, you mustn't.

1528
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,240
I don't think one is allowed to do that.

1529
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:05,240
And you have to walk on the grass.

1530
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:06,240
Yes indeed.

1531
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:08,240
And I really like walking on the grass.

1532
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:09,240
I always have.

1533
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,240
No buts.

1534
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:14,240
Come on everybody, let's make a start.

1535
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:22,240
That looks like fun, I'll pull some too.

1536
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:26,240
What are you doing?

1537
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,240
Can't you read?

1538
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:30,240
There's a sign saying it's forbidden to pull a charge.

1539
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,240
This one?

1540
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,240
Yeah!

1541
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:33,240
Oh, oh!

1542
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,240
Sorry!

1543
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,240
Oh!

1544
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:36,240
Oh!

1545
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:37,240
Oh!

1546
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,240
Oh!

1547
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,240
Oh!

1548
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,240
Oh!

1549
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,240
Oh!

1550
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:44,240
Oh!

1551
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:46,240
I'm beautiful sign!

1552
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:47,240
Bye bye!

1553
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:48,240
Bye bye!

1554
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:49,240
Oh!

1555
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,240
Oh!

1556
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,240
Oh!

1557
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,240
There you free!

1558
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,240
Go run!

1559
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,240
Okay!

1560
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,240
Stop!

1561
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,240
Wait!

1562
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:02,240
Oh!

1563
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:07,240
What an awesome pose!

1564
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:08,240
My goodness!

1565
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:11,240
Those little balls are shining!

1566
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,240
Oh!

1567
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,240
Oh!

1568
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,240
Oh!

1569
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:17,240
Oh!

1570
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,240
Oh!

1571
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:19,240
Oh!

1572
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:20,240
Oh!

1573
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:21,240
Quick, Brian!

1574
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:22,240
Those were howdy fat receipts!

1575
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:24,240
Come on everybody, run!

1576
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,240
Oh!

1577
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,240
Oh!

1578
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,240
Get out of here!

1579
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,240
Someone help!

1580
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,240
Someone help!

1581
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,240
The rest of me!

1582
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,240
Get down!

1583
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:39,240
Get away!

1584
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:40,240
Quick!

1585
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,240
That's terrible!

1586
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:48,240
Where could that floating theater have gone?

1587
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:51,240
They're still following us!

1588
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:57,240
Come on you kids, you can go wherever you want!

1589
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,240
Do what you like!

1590
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,240
Yeah, but I don't know what I want!

1591
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:02,240
Me neither!

1592
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,240
Me!

1593
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,240
I think they want to go with you, Snuffkin!

1594
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:08,240
But I don't know anything about small children!

1595
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:10,240
I'm not sure I even like them!

1596
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:12,240
All we have to do is find a theater!

1597
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:14,240
Moonman Mama will know what to do!

1598
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,240
In that case, let's go!

1599
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,240
A house!

1600
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:39,240
Yes and look!

1601
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,240
All the lights are on!

1602
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,240
Maybe they're celebrating with some relief!

1603
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,240
Shall we go there?

1604
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:46,240
Yes!

1605
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:59,240
Oh!

1606
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,240
Ah!

1607
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:03,240
At last!

1608
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:04,240
Oh!

1609
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,240
Hello!

1610
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,240
Happy midsummer!

1611
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:08,240
Thank you!

1612
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:10,240
Happy midsummer!

1613
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:12,240
What can I do for you?

1614
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:15,240
Would you have seen a theater drifting around somewhere, ma'am?

1615
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:16,240
A theater?

1616
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:20,240
Yes, you see a drifted away in the flood, and my powers are on it!

1617
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:22,240
Oh dear, I haven't seen anything like that!

1618
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,240
Oh, what a pity!

1619
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:26,240
Thank you! We'll look elsewhere!

1620
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:28,240
Have a nice midsummer party!

1621
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,240
Party?

1622
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:32,240
Oh yes, a party! Thank you very much!

1623
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:35,240
Very well then, I'll say goodnight!

1624
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:39,240
Did we say something wrong, Momen?

1625
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,240
I don't know.

1626
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:53,240
What's the matter?

1627
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,240
I think she's crying.

1628
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,240
Oh!

1629
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:58,240
Hello!

1630
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:00,240
Is there anything we can do, anything at all?

1631
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:02,240
Aren't you having a party, ma'am?

1632
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:06,240
No, unfortunately, she's not coming this year either.

1633
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:07,240
Oh is she?

1634
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:09,240
My aunt, my father's side.

1635
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:13,240
I invite her every year for a midsummer party, but she never comes.

1636
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:16,240
How sad! You must be very fond of her!

1637
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:19,240
Oh no! She's an awful person!

1638
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:23,240
If that's how you feel about her, why don't you invite someone else?

1639
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,240
She's my only relative!

1640
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:28,240
So invite someone who isn't a relative?

1641
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:31,240
Yes, why don't you invite us, for instance?

1642
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,240
Oh!

1643
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,240
Can one really do things like that?

1644
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:36,240
Just like that?

1645
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,240
Of course one can!

1646
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:40,240
Oh, how marvelous!

1647
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:43,240
To be perfectly honest, we're very hungry!

1648
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:46,240
I've made lots of extra pancakes.

1649
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:48,240
Please come in and join me.

1650
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:50,240
Thank you!

1651
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:55,240
Although we have drifted apart tonight, is midsummer's eve?

1652
01:36:55,240 --> 01:37:00,240
Let's drink a toast to Momen, Snork Maiden, and Little Mai, and hope that they're safe.

1653
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:03,240
You better drink to that no-good niece of mine, I guess.

1654
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,240
Who's that, Emma?

1655
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:06,240
My only relative.

1656
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:09,240
She lives all alone in a small house by the sea.

1657
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,240
Oh, is she all alone for midsummer?

1658
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,240
Probably. I always invite me over for pancakes.

1659
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:19,240
I don't like relatives, and I don't like pancakes, and she's boring, so I don't go.

1660
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:24,240
Well, let's toast her anyway, and here's hoping we'll all be together again very soon.

1661
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:26,240
Cheers!

1662
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,240
Good health!

1663
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:34,240
Oh, that was really good. Everything was delicious.

1664
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:36,240
I think I've eaten too much.

1665
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:39,240
Oh, please have some more. Oh, this is so nice.

1666
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:41,240
I couldn't eat another thing.

1667
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:44,240
Oh, sad. It's such fun having someone to cook for.

1668
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:47,240
I'm so pleased you're not at my door.

1669
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:49,240
All that's missing now is a bonfire.

1670
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:52,240
We always have one on midsummer eve.

1671
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:56,240
What a good idea. Let's have one.

1672
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:58,240
Over there.

1673
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:03,240
Help! Help!

1674
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:05,240
Help! Help!

1675
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,240
So glad you came.

1676
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:11,240
See these? The flood brought all of them.

1677
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:15,240
They were lying all over the place, so I tied them into one big pile.

1678
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:17,240
Would they make a good bonfire?

1679
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:19,240
Oh, a terrific one.

1680
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:21,240
Definitely.

1681
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,240
Oh, wow!

1682
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:52,240
We've walked for miles, but I can't see signs of a theater anywhere.

1683
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:55,240
Oh, don't worry. We'll find it soon.

1684
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:58,240
Huh? And what's the matter with you?

1685
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:00,240
I'm hungry. Me too.

1686
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:01,240
And me.

1687
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:03,240
I can't walk anymore.

1688
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:07,240
We don't have any food. If you want food, you'll have to look for it yourself.

1689
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:12,240
Oh, don't cry.

1690
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:14,240
Look over there, little lion.

1691
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,240
What?

1692
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,240
Over there, hidden behind the trees.

1693
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:18,240
Whoa, I have.

1694
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:19,240
And the lights are on.

1695
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,240
We're safe.

1696
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:33,240
Hey, kids, you can't go eating other people's food.

1697
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:37,240
You can if they are home, and it's just what's left over from a party.

1698
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:39,240
In fact, I will have some myself.

1699
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:41,240
It's amazing. I'm always so glad.

1700
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:42,240
Oh.

1701
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:50,240
Hey, kids, you can't go eating other people's food.

1702
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:54,240
You can if they are home, and it's just what's left over from a party.

1703
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,240
In fact, I will have some myself.

1704
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,240
It's amazing. I'm always so glad.

1705
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:07,240
Now we must pick nine flowers.

1706
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,240
Why is that Snorke maiden?

1707
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:12,240
I don't really know. It's always nine or seven of something.

1708
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,240
Okay, nine flowers.

1709
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:19,240
No, not the same kind. You must pick nine different flowers.

1710
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:21,240
And then what do you do?

1711
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:24,240
You turn around seven times like this.

1712
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,240
I get it.

1713
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:46,240
And then you walk backward until you reach a well.

1714
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:50,240
And then when you look down into the well,

1715
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:54,240
there you'll see the man you're going to marry.

1716
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:56,240
How do you get him up?

1717
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:59,240
I think I see him. What a clever well.

1718
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:01,240
That I must try.

1719
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:17,240
I'd like someone more romantic.

1720
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:18,240
Got you.

1721
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,240
What are you doing?

1722
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:22,240
I'm quietly now.

1723
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:25,240
All we did is pick some unprotected well flowers.

1724
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,240
I know what you did.

1725
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,240
Hey, Snorke maiden.

1726
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:30,240
Moon.

1727
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:33,240
Ha, you know each other. That makes it conspiracy.

1728
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:36,240
But I tell you, we've done nothing wrong, nothing at all.

1729
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:38,240
We were only celebrating.

1730
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:39,240
Better for you, if you haven't.

1731
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:42,240
But why? Can't you light a bonfire here, sir?

1732
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:46,240
I must warn you that all you say will be used against you.

1733
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:49,240
I have a complaint from the parkkeeper.

1734
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:52,240
You pulled up these signs from his park and you burnt them.

1735
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,240
That's not true.

1736
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:55,240
It is true that we burnt them, sir,

1737
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:57,240
but we didn't take them from any park.

1738
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,240
They were brought here by the flood.

1739
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:01,240
Older-dash, here's the evidence.

1740
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:02,240
Oh.

1741
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:05,240
I've caught you when that's that.

1742
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:14,240
Oh, I caught something.

1743
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:16,240
Oh, it's just a piece of wood.

1744
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:18,240
Had any ideas yet?

1745
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:20,240
Not a single one. How about you, mama?

1746
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:22,240
Same here, I'm afraid.

1747
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:25,240
I just can't seem to think of anything at all.

1748
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:35,240
You wouldn't have any ideas about what we should do next.

1749
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,240
Would you, Emma?

1750
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,240
About what?

1751
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:41,240
Some ideas about how to let the children know where we are, of course.

1752
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:45,240
How does anyone know where a theater is?

1753
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,240
I don't know.

1754
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:48,240
Please tell us.

1755
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:50,240
Well, you put on a play.

1756
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:51,240
A play?

1757
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,240
Yes, that is correct.

1758
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:54,240
This is a theater.

1759
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:57,240
And when you put on a new play, everybody comes flocking to see it.

1760
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:00,240
They come to laugh, to cry, to shout, and to applaud.

1761
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:03,240
And when your children hear of it, they will be hearing a flash.

1762
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:05,240
What a splendid idea, Emma.

1763
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:08,240
That's exactly what we'll do.

1764
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:11,240
Hmm, I'm sorry. We can't put on a play.

1765
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,240
Why not?

1766
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:17,240
We have no actors. They are pests, but one can't do without them.

1767
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:19,240
I can be one.

1768
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:21,240
And I'm also quite good at acting.

1769
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:23,240
I can act very well.

1770
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:27,240
There are only three of you and not one of you is an experienced professional actor.

1771
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:30,240
Don't forget, we have you, Emma.

1772
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:31,240
Me?

1773
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:37,240
Well, I've always felt that I would make a rather good Shakespearean heroine.

1774
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:41,240
And we can each have many parts, as long as they're not all on the stage at the same time.

1775
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:43,240
He isn't at so moment, Papa.

1776
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,240
Of course, it's possible to do it.

1777
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:47,240
I want the part that finds the treasure.

1778
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:50,240
No, that's impossible. We have no play.

1779
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:53,240
Nothing simple enough for the likes of you.

1780
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:56,240
A moment, Papa, can write one. He's very talented.

1781
01:43:56,240 --> 01:44:00,240
No trouble at all, my dear. Any number of acts.

1782
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:02,240
But we don't want any number. We want three acts.

1783
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:05,240
That's what all proper plays always have, moment, Papa.

1784
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:07,240
Let's start right away.

1785
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:09,240
We gotta print posters.

1786
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:10,240
And clean the stage.

1787
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:12,240
Whatever, if I started.

1788
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:14,240
Aw.

1789
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:20,240
And this was how Woman Papa got started on a short career as a playwright.

1790
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:52,240
But while the birds carry news of the play far and wide,

1791
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:58,240
what has to become of Woman and Snork Maiden?

1792
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:02,240
Their troubles are real ones.

1793
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:18,240
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

1794
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:26,240
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

1795
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:30,240
They're always happy and goes at play.

1796
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:37,240
The movements are having fun day after day. The movements.

1797
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:41,240
The movements.

1798
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:47,240
The movements.

1799
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:15,240
Here they are for one and all. The movements are about to come.

1800
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:18,240
Come on and sit down here with me.

1801
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:23,240
They're here for you on your TV. They are the movements.

1802
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:26,240
They are the movements.

1803
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:30,240
So come with me, give me your hand.

1804
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:33,240
I'll take you up to a movement land.

1805
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:38,240
You can fly just like a bird and sing that song ever.

1806
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:41,240
There were the movements.

1807
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:45,240
There were the movements.

1808
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:50,240
There were the movements.

1809
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:53,240
There were the movements.

1810
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:56,240
There were the movements.

1811
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:57,760
About our brain.

1812
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:06,800
All over Blüven Valley, bits of paper were fluttering down.

1813
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:11,680
No, we're so weak, are you still going?

1814
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:15,040
They were even falling over the lake.

1815
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:22,480
What's this? Oh, litter.

1816
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:26,480
There's some writing on that piece of paper. I think it's a message.

1817
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:29,480
Hmm, hmm. Let's see.

1818
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:33,480
Moomin' theatre presents written by Moomin' Papa.

1819
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:34,480
Moomin' Papa.

1820
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:37,480
The last children of Moomin' Valley.

1821
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:42,480
Starring Moomin' Papa, Moomin' Mama, and Sniff and introducing Emma.

1822
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:46,480
Emma? I'm sure that's my ad. She works in a theatre.

1823
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:50,480
Admission fee? Anything edible?

1824
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:55,480
They're putting on a play. So they can't be lost.

1825
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:59,480
Hmm. I haven't seen a play since I was a kid.

1826
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:05,480
It was wonderful. The best play ever. All about a princess.

1827
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:09,480
She fell asleep in a rose bush. She was so lovely.

1828
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:14,480
I've got to see that one again. But who will guard my prisoners, I wonder?

1829
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:19,480
I'm a good idea, officer. You could take the three of us with you to the theatre to see the play.

1830
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:24,480
Good idea. We love the theatre, so we won't try to run away, officer. I promise.

1831
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:29,480
Hmm. That's possible. I won't let you out of this jail until you write out.

1832
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:36,480
It's forbidden to burn signs 5,000 times each. That's the punishment for vandals.

1833
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:39,480
Well, in that case, you won't be able to see the play.

1834
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:44,480
Ah, who cares? Oh, whoa. Yes, I must see it. I must go.

1835
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:47,480
So you'll take us with you? No, you stay right here.

1836
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:50,480
Well, then you can't go either, officer.

1837
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:52,480
Quiet. You're upsetting me.

1838
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:56,480
No, no. This isn't good enough. It's not true drama.

1839
01:48:56,480 --> 01:49:01,480
Ah, please, woman, papa. I don't want to be just a lion's ugly behind.

1840
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:03,480
But, sniff, I did give you another part.

1841
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:05,480
I don't want to be a baby either.

1842
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:11,480
And she said you wanted parts without lines. Could you do the dusting a bit later, Emma, please?

1843
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:16,480
His script should be ready now. We have to start practicing for the opening night tomorrow morning.

1844
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:19,480
Don't worry, Emma. It's coming along.

1845
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:23,480
I'm only half done. I shall never get ready in time, woman, mama.

1846
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:27,480
You're right to worry. For the curtain will rise tomorrow, no matter what.

1847
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:33,480
Women papa will remember to give Emma lots and lots of lines.

1848
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:36,480
She's really looking forward to her first performance.

1849
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:40,480
All right. Now, leave me. I must be left alone to concentrate.

1850
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:43,480
The writer needs peace and quiet.

1851
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:46,480
There are some things I don't like about this script.

1852
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:50,480
I'll discuss it with you after the performance, sniff, after.

1853
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:55,480
If it's a story about lost children, why do you have to have a stupid lion?

1854
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:58,480
I'm too good an actor to be cast as a lion.

1855
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:02,480
I'll keep them out of my hair when India is giving me a headache.

1856
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:05,480
You come with me, sniff. We'll practice our parts.

1857
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:09,480
This could be a wonderful play if you'd only skip the lions behind.

1858
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:12,480
I've heard enough about this behind.

1859
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:17,480
Remember, we have a lion's head, too, dying to show his acting skills on the stage.

1860
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:21,480
This is my play, and I refuse to write out the lion's butt.

1861
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:24,480
I refuse.

1862
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:30,480
Here is the key. I want you to keep a keen eye on them until I come back.

1863
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:32,480
Do you understand me, cousin?

1864
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:34,480
Are they very dangerous?

1865
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:37,480
Yes, they certainly are. They bite if you let them out.

1866
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:38,480
Okay?

1867
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:40,480
We certainly wouldn't bite anyone, obviously.

1868
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:44,480
I've had enough of your lies. Don't listen to my dear cousin. They do.

1869
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:48,480
Well, then, now I'm up to the theater to see the play.

1870
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:51,480
Take good care of them while I'm gone.

1871
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:06,480
Excuse me. You seem to be a very good knitter.

1872
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:09,480
Oh, thank you.

1873
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:12,480
Nobody ever said that to me before. I enjoy it.

1874
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:14,480
What are you making?

1875
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:18,480
I'm not sure. I don't really know. Nothing in particular.

1876
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:22,480
It's just that knitting is so reassuring somehow.

1877
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:25,480
Nothing bad can happen while you knit, can it?

1878
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:31,480
The trouble is I always seem to forget to decide what to make before I start.

1879
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:35,480
But it feels nice and warm, and I love the color.

1880
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:38,480
Can you make socks? It's a very nice sock color.

1881
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:40,480
Socks?

1882
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:43,480
Yes, it's very, very cold in here.

1883
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:47,480
Oh, yes. That's a very good idea.

1884
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:52,480
Listen, if I knitted each one of you a pair of warm socks,

1885
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:55,480
would you really put them on? Of course!

1886
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:58,480
That would be nice. I'm almost freezing to death in here.

1887
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,480
It's so very, very cold.

1888
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,480
Is it really that cold?

1889
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:07,480
Yes, my teeth are chattering, so I could hardly talk, honestly.

1890
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:12,480
Oh, dear, oh dear. What should I do?

1891
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:17,480
Maybe some steaming hot black currant juice would help to warm us up a little.

1892
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:21,480
Possibly, although it might already be too late.

1893
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:41,480
My cousin would be very angry with me if he knew, but I think...

1894
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:42,480
But you think what?

1895
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:46,480
I think I'll let you out so that we can all be nice and warm indoors.

1896
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:47,480
Really?

1897
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:50,480
Wait, wait, wait.

1898
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:53,480
Don't cry now, baby.

1899
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:57,480
There's a good boy. Don't cry, honey.

1900
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,480
That's enough, baby.

1901
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:06,480
Whoa!

1902
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:10,480
Oh, woman mama, you need to show much more emotion.

1903
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:13,480
Try to be more motherly and more loving.

1904
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:16,480
Listen, dear. This is a very heavy baby.

1905
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:18,480
How am I doing, woman papa?

1906
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:22,480
You're just perfect for the part sniffing your performance was excellent.

1907
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:27,480
Maybe I should add a part with some lines in it.

1908
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:43,480
Look at these. I think they might be ready by now.

1909
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:47,480
I hope they're tasty. They don't always come out very well.

1910
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:50,480
You're so kind. We've had so much already.

1911
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:52,480
But they smell really delicious.

1912
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:53,480
They sure do.

1913
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:56,480
Thank you so much. Now I feel warm again.

1914
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,480
How about some more black currant juice?

1915
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,480
Or maybe one of these freshly baked cookies?

1916
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:03,480
It's very kind of you, but no thank you.

1917
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:06,480
I couldn't eat another thing. I'm so full up.

1918
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:08,480
Me too.

1919
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:11,480
Oh dear, the party is over then.

1920
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:14,480
I'm afraid so.

1921
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:17,480
It's really sad, but I have to lock you up again.

1922
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:19,480
But at least I know you're warm in there.

1923
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:24,480
We're real sorry too, but you don't need to worry because actually we're not going back to jail.

1924
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:26,480
Oh, aren't you?

1925
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:30,480
We've got other plans. We're going to the theater. Just see my parents play.

1926
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:34,480
And I suppose I should say hello to my Aunt Emma, who works there.

1927
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:39,480
Oh, what shall I do? My cousin will be very cross with me.

1928
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:43,480
But you see, we're innocent. We didn't do anything wrong.

1929
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:44,480
You didn't?

1930
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:46,480
I swear it.

1931
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:49,480
Do I look like someone who pulls up signs in a park?

1932
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:52,480
We just burned some flocks and left by the flood.

1933
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:54,480
But your cousin wouldn't believe it.

1934
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:58,480
He's a conclusions, wrongful arrest. That's all it was.

1935
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:02,480
Oh dear, why didn't you tell me that it once?

1936
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:06,480
People shouldn't go to jail when they haven't done anything wrong.

1937
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,480
So we can go to the theaters, that okay?

1938
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:10,480
Of course, better leave right away.

1939
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:14,480
My cousin will be fairly disappointed, but I guess I can't be helped.

1940
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:16,480
Wait for me.

1941
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:23,480
I think I'd better come along and explain to that cousin of mine that his three prisoners are innocent of the charge against them.

1942
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:30,480
All right, all right, bring it in. That's right, Mom.

1943
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:32,480
Papa, stop there.

1944
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:33,480
Okay, sniff.

1945
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:35,480
Mom and Mama, what have you got there?

1946
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:40,480
A baby's crib. I want to use this in the play. If that's all right with you.

1947
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:42,480
Mom and Papa, Mom and Papa.

1948
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:46,480
I've just read your script and I think you have a big problem.

1949
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:50,480
Who is going to pay the parts of Mom and Snork Maiden in this play of yours?

1950
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:55,480
I don't know yet. We don't have any more children and Sniff can't take the part.

1951
01:55:55,480 --> 01:56:02,480
Are you utterly mad? We only have a few hours before the curtain goes up and you don't even have actors for all the part.

1952
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:03,480
What kind of director is that?

1953
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:07,480
Maybe one of us could stand behind something and sort of read their lines.

1954
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:11,480
Wait, thank you, us. I give up. Let's hope the credits are proud.

1955
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,480
Hold on tight, all of you.

1956
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:28,480
Listen kids, you can be as noisy as you like out here but once we're at the dinner you have to be quiet.

1957
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:30,480
You understand me right?

1958
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:51,480
The audience is waiting for us. Come.

1959
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:12,480
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for giving up your valuable time in order to come to our show tonight.

1960
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:19,480
The world premiere of the lost children. This is a brand new company and the players never been performed before.

1961
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:23,480
Ladies and gentlemen, sit back and enjoy the superb acting.

1962
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:26,480
What's that? A baby's cradle. It's for you, Sniff.

1963
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:27,480
For me?

1964
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:31,480
We sincerely hope you'll be thrilled by the originality of the plot.

1965
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:36,480
And so now dear friends, let's get started. Let's get started.

1966
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:44,480
Come on, come on.

1967
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:53,480
There's a good boy. Don't cry, honey. Please don't cry.

1968
01:57:54,480 --> 01:58:03,480
Oh, moment, snorkemaid and my darling children. You've been lost for a whole month and we haven't heard a word from either of you.

1969
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:05,480
Oh, he's forgotten all about me.

1970
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:12,480
I'd give the whole world to be rid of this most terrible agonizing despair.

1971
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:19,480
Oh, make your husband try not to fret so I'm sure he'll be back before very long.

1972
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:29,480
Little children, come and free me from this plight. Your mother worries all day through the baby's awake all night. Come home, come home my children to.

1973
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,480
With all our hearts, we're missing you.

1974
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:38,480
Louder, Sniff.

1975
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:43,480
But what's wrong with you, Sniff?

1976
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:45,480
This rocket's making me sick.

1977
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:48,480
Oh, dear, and right in the middle of movement, Papa's play.

1978
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:54,480
Mama, let us set forth and find our loved one.

1979
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,480
We cannot leave our baby here.

1980
01:58:57,480 --> 01:59:00,480
Oh, anyone would love to have him sweet little thing.

1981
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:03,480
For how long, pray, do you think we would be gone?

1982
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:09,480
For as long as it takes, I can no longer stand being this frightfully upset about my children.

1983
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:10,480
Oh, baby!

1984
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:14,480
Yeah.

1985
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:21,480
Hurry up, Sniff.

1986
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:23,480
I'm trying!

1987
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:27,480
Hurry, scene two is about to start.

1988
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:30,480
Help me somebody, I can't get out of here!

1989
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:32,480
When do they put the princess on?

1990
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:34,480
We still have very far to go.

1991
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:36,480
I'm afraid so hurry, movement.

1992
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:37,480
I am hurrying.

1993
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:38,480
It's for bitten.

1994
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:39,480
It's for bitten.

1995
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:40,480
It's for bitten.

1996
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:41,480
It's for bitten.

1997
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:42,480
What are you writing on that, man?

1998
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:45,480
My cousin won't give up, I'm sure.

1999
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:47,480
So I better write this 5,000 times.

2000
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:48,480
It's for bitten.

2001
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:49,480
It's for bitten.

2002
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:50,480
It's for bitten.

2003
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:52,480
It's for bitten.

2004
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:56,480
A full two weeks has passed.

2005
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:58,480
Oh, what shall we do?

2006
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:02,480
Our dear children have disappeared from the face of the earth.

2007
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:06,480
Oh, what's happened, dear apple of my heart?

2008
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:09,480
I think I sprained my hands really badly.

2009
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:10,480
Oh, it hurts.

2010
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:14,480
If you were in trouble, apart from the wolves, we're all alone.

2011
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:16,480
I'll put you out.

2012
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:17,480
Stop!

2013
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:18,480
Stop!

2014
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:20,480
Why must this happen in my theater?

2015
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:23,480
I've been squeezed in here to make me look smaller.

2016
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:24,480
Help!

2017
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:25,480
I'm trying to.

2018
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:27,480
We can't have the lion on stage without his behind.

2019
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:28,480
Wow!

2020
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:29,480
Whoa!

2021
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:30,480
Whoa!

2022
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:31,480
Oh, whoa!

2023
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:33,480
Whoa!

2024
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:37,480
We have to face the worst and spend the night right here in the wilderness.

2025
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,480
Dear husband, will it be all right?

2026
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:43,480
Fairly in these unhellowed woods, I feel quite queasy.

2027
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:49,480
Sweet wife, I too can smell those frightful beasts howling for a blood.

2028
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:52,480
May not just smell them, dear.

2029
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,480
Anything that I can hear them now.

2030
02:00:56,480 --> 02:01:00,480
I can hear the howling of those hungry beasts.

2031
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:06,480
Paint is the roar, but I can make it out a lion.

2032
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:08,480
Whoa!

2033
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:09,480
Whoa!

2034
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:15,480
Oh, sniff, what's up?

2035
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:17,480
Where are you going, dear?

2036
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:22,480
Oh, listen, I have to go and stop that stupid lion

2037
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:26,480
who's roaming around the countryside watching our every move.

2038
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:29,480
Hey, don't worry, I'll be right back, my dear.

2039
02:01:29,480 --> 02:01:32,480
Was he supposed to say that?

2040
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:35,480
Hey, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be on stage.

2041
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:37,480
It's not my father stuck in his crib.

2042
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:41,480
Moment, mama, stuck on stage. Roll a lion.

2043
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:46,480
Ooh, that lion sounds very close.

2044
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:48,480
My husband must be in great danger.

2045
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:50,480
All right, under that stage, both of you.

2046
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:58,480
Papa, I can't get this thing off, I feel sick.

2047
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:03,480
What are you doing, moment, papa?

2048
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:05,480
You can do it with a cradle on, sniff.

2049
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:07,480
No, I can't. Stop it, please.

2050
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:08,480
Don't do it, moment, papa.

2051
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:10,480
They'll laugh at me out there.

2052
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:13,480
Don't worry, nobody knows it's you hiding in there.

2053
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:15,480
Come on now, hurry.

2054
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:22,480
A lion, a lion is this to be my most untimely end?

2055
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,480
Don't you dare laugh at me.

2056
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:40,480
Whoa, is that lion gonna eat, moment, mama?

2057
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:44,480
Oh, no, what might you do?

2058
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:46,480
What should I do, moment, papa?

2059
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:48,480
I'm scared, can't be bothered to do.

2060
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:51,480
Let's run off across the stage, dear.

2061
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:53,480
We were supposed to run off together.

2062
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:55,480
Well, the situation has changed.

2063
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:58,480
I'll have to come to your rescue some other time, dear.

2064
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:00,480
Oh, help me.

2065
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:08,480
Help me, please.

2066
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:10,480
Please, hold out, everyone.

2067
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:12,480
They got to really see it.

2068
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:22,480
Help me, please.

2069
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:25,480
Someone, come quickly before I get killed.

2070
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:26,480
Oh.

2071
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:28,480
Coming, moment, mama.

2072
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:30,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2073
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:41,480
Oh, it's only snap.

2074
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:43,480
Little Maya, I'm so glad you're all right.

2075
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:47,480
Shirley, weren't worried about me, moment, mama.

2076
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:49,480
Well, just a little, maybe.

2077
02:03:49,480 --> 02:03:52,480
But you're such a lucky girl, I knew you'd manage.

2078
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:53,480
Mama, mama.

2079
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:55,480
I don't believe it.

2080
02:03:55,480 --> 02:03:57,480
Mama, it's me, moment.

2081
02:03:57,480 --> 02:03:59,480
It's me, Snorkemaiden.

2082
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:01,480
Mama, mama.

2083
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:03,480
Moment, Snorkemaiden.

2084
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:05,480
Is it really you?

2085
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:07,480
Come here and let me see you.

2086
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:11,480
We've come back, mama.

2087
02:04:11,480 --> 02:04:13,480
I was dying to see you.

2088
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:16,480
Oh, it's wonderful to have you back.

2089
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:18,480
Isn't that my niece?

2090
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:19,480
And Emma.

2091
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:20,480
Oh.

2092
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:23,480
You look so grown up.

2093
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:26,480
And Emma, so sorry to have missed your show,

2094
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:29,480
but I have so much to tell you.

2095
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:31,480
Hi, everybody.

2096
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:33,480
That was a great performance.

2097
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:35,480
Snorkemaiden, I'm so glad to see you.

2098
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:37,480
Glad you're safe, moment.

2099
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:38,480
Yay!

2100
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:40,480
Yay!

2101
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:41,480
Those are my prisoners.

2102
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:43,480
They've escaped from jail.

2103
02:04:43,480 --> 02:04:44,480
Catch them.

2104
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:47,480
No, cousin.

2105
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:50,480
I let them out because they swear they're innocent.

2106
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:53,480
They didn't pull up a single one of those signs.

2107
02:04:53,480 --> 02:04:54,480
That's right.

2108
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,480
I was the one who did that deliberately.

2109
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:58,480
And I helped him.

2110
02:04:58,480 --> 02:04:59,480
Very well.

2111
02:04:59,480 --> 02:05:00,480
You're both under arrest.

2112
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:02,480
No, no, no!

2113
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:05,480
We were these dreadful children.

2114
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:07,480
Dear dear cousin.

2115
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:11,480
It's forbidden.

2116
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:13,480
Five thousand times. That's what you wanted.

2117
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:16,480
And are you sure there are five thousand?

2118
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:19,480
Oh, yes. Quite sure. I've counted them.

2119
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:22,480
One, two, three, four.

2120
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:24,480
Now that we are all together again,

2121
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:27,480
I would really like to go back to Moomin Valley.

2122
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:29,480
What shall we do with all these little pests?

2123
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:30,480
Snuffkin.

2124
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:31,480
Well, little Mai.

2125
02:05:31,480 --> 02:05:33,480
Someone might like to foster them.

2126
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:36,480
You can leave them in my car, sir.

2127
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:38,480
And yours, Emma?

2128
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:39,480
Yes.

2129
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:41,480
Now I have some acting experience.

2130
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:43,480
I think I would like to start an acting school.

2131
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:45,480
Exactly what this theater needs.

2132
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:46,480
What a good idea.

2133
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:48,480
Do you think I would be too old to attend?

2134
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:50,480
Perhaps character parts.

2135
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:51,480
Like in my play.

2136
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:53,480
All is arranged for the best.

2137
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:54,480
So now we can go home.

2138
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:57,480
It is Moomin Papa. I think it's high time.

2139
02:05:57,480 --> 02:06:00,480
Quiet, please. I've lost my cup.

2140
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:03,480
Now I'll have to start again right from the beginning.

2141
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:06,480
Moomin Papa, do you think we should thank the audience

2142
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:09,480
for their patience because they're still watching us, you know?

2143
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:12,480
Oh, you're right.

2144
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:16,480
Ladies and gentlemen, that's all for tonight.

2145
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:19,480
I hope you have enjoyed the performance.

2146
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:23,480
I think it was very kind of you to stay to the very end.

2147
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:39,480
Sometimes I could almost believe the truth is strange to the fiction of it.

2148
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:42,480
Well, it is, isn't it, Moomin Papa?

2149
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,480
No, not really.

2150
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:46,480
We writers are no better.

2151
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:48,480
Go write more play.

2152
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:51,480
Oh, what a very good idea, Moomin Papa.

2153
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:54,480
I think you're as good with plays as you are with memoirs.

2154
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:55,480
Are you too?

2155
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:59,480
Right, I'll start on the sequel as soon as we're all back home.

2156
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:05,480
There it is, I lovely home.

2157
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:07,480
At least I got a proper wash.

2158
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:09,480
I've never seen it so clean.

2159
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:10,480
What about in sign?

2160
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:12,480
Oh, redecorated, probably.

2161
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:13,480
Yeah.

2162
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:14,480
Let's go.

2163
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:18,480
The Moomin family spent the whole of the following week

2164
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:20,480
making their house cozy and comfortable.

2165
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:23,480
And soon each carpet, each cup and saucer

2166
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:27,480
and every piece of furniture was back in its proper place once again.

2167
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:48,480
They're always happy and goes at play.

2168
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:52,480
The Moons are having fun day after day.

2169
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:55,480
The Moons.

2170
02:07:55,480 --> 02:07:59,480
The Moons.

2171
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:05,480
The Moons.

2172
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:20,480
The Moons.

2173
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:31,480
Here they are for one and all.

2174
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:34,480
The Moons are about to call.

2175
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:37,480
Come on and sit down here with me.

2176
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:39,480
They're here for you on your TV.

2177
02:08:39,480 --> 02:08:42,480
They are the Moons.

2178
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:45,480
They are the Moons.

2179
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:48,480
So come with me, give me your hand.

2180
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:51,480
I'll take you up to a moment land.

2181
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:54,480
You can fly just like a bird.

2182
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:56,480
Sing that song ever.

2183
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:59,480
There were the Moons.

2184
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:02,480
There were the Moons.

2185
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:05,480
There were the Moons.

2186
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:08,480
There were the Moons.

2187
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:11,480
There were the Moons.

2188
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:16,480
There were the Moons.

2189
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:27,480
One night, the moment was having a dream.

2190
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:31,480
What a wonderful feeling to be flying like this.

2191
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:33,480
Look over there, Moons.

2192
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:35,480
What a beautiful lake.

2193
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:39,480
This is one of the most fantastic experiences I've ever had.

2194
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:40,480
Me too.

2195
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:43,480
I never knew birds had such a marvelous life.

2196
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:47,480
Seeing things from a completely different point of view.

2197
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:50,480
We're flying pretty high aren't we?

2198
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:52,480
I'm scared.

2199
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:54,480
We're much too high.

2200
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:55,480
Let's go down.

2201
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:58,480
Please let's go down at once.

2202
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:02,480
I'm not scared of heights.

2203
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:06,480
Oh snort, this time you really have succeeded.

2204
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:10,480
Will I could build hundreds of these if you wanted me to?

2205
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:13,480
Snort, can I steer just for a little while?

2206
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:15,480
Now you're here.

2207
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:17,480
Oh, thank you.

2208
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:20,480
Do you really know how to steer this thing?

2209
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:26,480
Hey, stop it, stinky.

2210
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:29,480
That's dangerous.

2211
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:39,480
This is okay, really.

2212
02:10:39,480 --> 02:10:41,480
It's just a dream.

2213
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:03,480
Oh gosh, my head hurts so.

2214
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:05,480
What a strange dream.

2215
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:08,480
Did my brother let stinky steer his flying ship?

2216
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:10,480
Surely not.

2217
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:14,480
I was talking to the snork while I looked away, suddenly stinky took his place.

2218
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:17,480
Oh, and then the thing began tilting?

2219
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:19,480
Hmm, but it was just a dream.

2220
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:21,480
I don't care, I don't like it.

2221
02:11:21,480 --> 02:11:25,480
You shouldn't have dreams like that just when my brother's flying ship is almost ready.

2222
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:28,480
Dreams often come true, you know.

2223
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:32,480
But it was nothing like the ship your brother's building, it was totally different.

2224
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:34,480
But tell me what happened to it in the end.

2225
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:36,480
Did it fall down?

2226
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:40,480
I don't know, I lost sight of it when I fell off and I didn't see it again.

2227
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:43,480
Well, surely you could have turned your head to take a look.

2228
02:11:43,480 --> 02:11:45,480
Well, I didn't.

2229
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:49,480
Listen, moment, don't say a word to the snork about this.

2230
02:11:49,480 --> 02:11:51,480
He's nervous enough as it is.

2231
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:52,480
Of course not.

2232
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:54,480
Why don't we just forget about it?

2233
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:56,480
Pretend it never happened, eh?

2234
02:11:58,480 --> 02:12:01,480
Oh, snork, it's finally completed.

2235
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:04,480
Sure it is, but it hasn't been flown yet, of course.

2236
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:08,480
But it will, I won't snork, you don't think there's anything wrong with it?

2237
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:10,480
Of course not, but it's just...

2238
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:12,480
Is there some problem, snork?

2239
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:14,480
Well, there might be.

2240
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:15,480
So, what is it?

2241
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:16,480
Fuel.

2242
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:17,480
Fuel?

2243
02:12:17,480 --> 02:12:21,480
But you said you had developed a new fuel that was really good.

2244
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:26,480
It's good, but you see, you see, it might not be powerful enough.

2245
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:29,480
You mean it might not be able to fly?

2246
02:12:29,480 --> 02:12:32,480
No, it won't. You're quite right.

2247
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:36,480
Or it will just be an ordinary ship, not a flying ship.

2248
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:40,480
Oh, that would be nice. What can't go up can't possibly fall down.

2249
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:46,480
But that's not the point if it won't fly. Everyone will laugh at me. I know they will.

2250
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:48,480
I won't laugh, I promise.

2251
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:50,480
Maybe not. Others will.

2252
02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:55,480
But you wouldn't care about that, would you? Who cares what other people think?

2253
02:12:55,480 --> 02:13:00,480
I've already told people that the test flight will be quite soon, in public.

2254
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:05,480
But I'm sure people will be very nice about it, even if it doesn't get off the ground.

2255
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:08,480
That's hardly what I want.

2256
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:14,480
Moomin, I'd like to ask you a favor. That's why I sent for you. Will you help me?

2257
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:17,480
I'll do anything you ask, snork, of course.

2258
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:21,480
What I would like is for you, Moomin, my friend, to be test pilot for me tomorrow.

2259
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:24,480
You want me to be a pilot?

2260
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:55,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

2261
02:13:55,480 --> 02:14:25,480
Stinky, I'm going to steer that ship, is that perfectly clear? You're not to touch the wheel, I'm the pilot now. What on earth was that about? Wouldn't you find it difficult to steer it? Oh, no, it's real easy, but of course, I'd need to practice before the public demonstration. Is the snorke going to fly his own ship? He'll be there, but he has to stay down in the

2262
02:14:25,480 --> 02:14:55,480
engine room, snuff can. I wonder if this ship will really fly. The only problem is the fuel. Only the fuel you say. That's a big problem. I suppose so. Listen, woman, suppose now the snorke's flying ship really gets off the ground. Well, of course, it's going to, Papa. That something could happen, something could break or you could fall into an air pocket. It's such a dangerous undertaking. Think, woman. Papa!

2263
02:14:55,480 --> 02:15:25,480
Not natural for movements to fly about up in the air. Is it snuffkin? Quite right. What would you and the snorke do if things went wrong? We will be wearing parachutes, you know? Parachutes. You do know what they are, don't you, Papa? Of course I do. They come down from the sky like this, like this. Exactly, but of course, we won't need a parachute, because nothing will go wrong. And I will be the first flying ship pilot ever!

2264
02:15:25,480 --> 02:15:55,480
Oh. Hi there. Hello, my young man. Hello. How do you do? How do you do everybody? Hello, sir. I wonder if you can help me. Do you happen to know where the snorke's factory is? You mean the ship? I must see him. I'm most eager to have a look at his famous flying ship. How do you know about that? It's supposed to be very secret. The information must have leaked out somehow.

2265
02:15:55,480 --> 02:16:25,480
You inventors know about what he is trying to do. He's famous throughout Moomin Valley this snorke. Really? Are you an inventor, too? Indeed I am. One of the more famous. I think maybe the most famous of them all. I am Moomin Papa. How do you do, sir? I'm snuffkin. And my name is Moomin. Please to meet you. A very good day to you, one and all. The muffles, my name.

2266
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:55,480
He said I'm the muffle. You mean you've never even heard of me the most famous inventor? Oh yes, I'm sure I am. The muffle, isn't it? Yes, it is the muffle. Have you invented anything exciting, muffle, Mr. Muffle? I would be much easier to tell you what I haven't invented, young man. For instance, the pin that can't prick because it has two heads. The newspaper that reads itself the purse that moans and groans if you take money from me.

2267
02:16:55,480 --> 02:17:24,480
The adhesive tape that sticks only to itself. This is perhaps the greatest of all my latest inventions. Whatever is that? This is proper self a man powered fan. Infanible in Moomin weather. All these are my latest inventions.

2268
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:42,480
You didn't know that, did you? No, it isn't. But try and get a handkerchief, the square balloon, the five wheel car, the hexagonal frying pan, the seven hole button, and a host of others. Indeed, how interesting. What did you want to see the snorkel boat?

2269
02:17:42,480 --> 02:18:01,480
I thought I might be able to help him out with one of my inventions. That's what? Oh, Jill, which one? My new? No, it's very top secret stuff I can tell you. Now, where is the snorke's factory? I'll take you right there. Very kind of you. Come, he'll be so surprised.

2270
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:23,480
Must be off. See you again. It's a pleasure to help these budding inventors. Snorkel be so excited. A famous inventor, eh? What is your opinion, snorke? Have you ever seen a triangular handkerchief, Moomin Papa? No, when I don't want to either. I do wonder what he's cooked up for the snorke, though. It is sort of intriguing. Yes, indeed.

2271
02:18:23,480 --> 02:18:31,480
Moomin will be able to tell us later, I suppose. Yes, but anything could happen before then. Can we wait that long snorke? You're right.

2272
02:18:35,480 --> 02:18:47,480
No, wait for me. I'm coming with you. Oh, I thought we had several guests. Now, where in the world are they all gone?

2273
02:18:53,480 --> 02:18:55,480
Hm?

2274
02:19:03,480 --> 02:19:07,480
Now, where are they off to, I wonder?

2275
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:15,480
Oh, look who's coming!

2276
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:35,480
What are you doing here? We're just interested. Where are the muffle and the snorke? The snorke and the muffle are discussing some top-secret project. It's very harsh. Not a triangular handkerchief, I hope.

2277
02:19:35,480 --> 02:19:47,480
I don't know, Papa. As I said, it's top-secret. Let's see. Oh, bother. The curtains in the way, so I can't see a thing.

2278
02:19:50,480 --> 02:20:01,480
So this is the powerful fuel you've developed, is it, Mr. Muffle? Yes, it is. Not as original as my other inventions, I admit. But very useful. Yes, useful. I call it super fuel.

2279
02:20:01,480 --> 02:20:17,480
Only trouble is my engine has been designed for liquid fuel. No problem at all, young man. If you dissolve this block of fuel in 10 liters of water, your engine will run for at least 10 hours. For 10 whole hours? That's incredible.

2280
02:20:17,480 --> 02:20:31,480
If you doubt the word of the muffle, then try it out and see for yourself right now. Right now? Better still, I guarantee that if used as it is in a solid state, your engine will run not for 10, but for 100 hours.

2281
02:20:31,480 --> 02:20:40,480
100 hours? But that's incredible. You really must be some inventor. Indeed, if what you say is true, it would solve the last problem of my flying ship.

2282
02:20:41,480 --> 02:20:47,480
Oh, now that I've looked more closely at the padlock, this store isn't locked. No, it isn't.

2283
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:55,480
So if one wanted to see the snorke, one could walk right in. But why would you want to see him, Papa? Well...

2284
02:20:55,480 --> 02:21:02,480
Why don't you tell us? I don't want snorke falling for one of the muffles crazy ideas, that's why.

2285
02:21:02,480 --> 02:21:08,480
Well, we'll find out pretty soon. Maybe you don't realize it, but the snorke is pretty clever, you know.

2286
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:13,480
I think I know exactly what they're doing in there. Yeah, what?

2287
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:21,480
I saw that man pouring something into the flying ship. What was it? Well, I guess it must have been fuel, movement.

2288
02:21:21,480 --> 02:21:27,480
Well, how come you saw him? There's a crack that's just about wide enough for me, but I won't tell you where.

2289
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:32,480
What are those two in there talking about? Oh, yeah, so this is the great super fuel.

2290
02:21:32,480 --> 02:21:36,480
Wait a minute, snorke, there must be something wrong with it. Yeah, you're right.

2291
02:21:36,480 --> 02:21:43,480
What the hell? There you are. Solid fuel indeed, huh? A hundred hours? You're an imposter, sir.

2292
02:21:43,480 --> 02:21:53,480
No, it isn't true, if you just let me explain. No, thank you. I know very well why you came over here with that ridiculous story, off with you right now.

2293
02:21:53,480 --> 02:22:00,480
Listen to me. It is not ridiculous, and it is not just a story. Maybe we shouldn't have dissolved it in the water.

2294
02:22:00,480 --> 02:22:09,480
That was a mistake. Imposter? But I'm the muffler. I don't care. Maybe it's just a misunderstanding, and the fuel isn't suited for flying ships.

2295
02:22:09,480 --> 02:22:16,480
Wrong, it suits everything. Forget the fuel. That was just a trick so he could come here and get to see my flying ship.

2296
02:22:16,480 --> 02:22:21,480
So the muffler has come here to spy, man. Ridiculous. I don't steal.

2297
02:22:21,480 --> 02:22:24,480
Papa, was there anything you wanted to see me about?

2298
02:22:24,480 --> 02:22:31,480
Eh? No, I just dropped by. No cause for excitement. The fuels are done.

2299
02:22:31,480 --> 02:22:36,480
No, it's not. That's not true. I don't invent guns. What would be the point of inventing them?

2300
02:22:36,480 --> 02:22:40,480
Oh, listen to me, please. Let's try and use the fuel once more.

2301
02:22:40,480 --> 02:22:46,480
No, thanks. Once was once too many. I'll have to clean my tanks from your gunge. Get out of my sight.

2302
02:22:51,480 --> 02:23:01,480
Oh dear, this must have been a bit of a disappointment for the snork. I know.

2303
02:23:01,480 --> 02:23:14,480
Now listen, stinky. I'm doing this for the snorksake, isn't that so?

2304
02:23:14,480 --> 02:23:19,480
I don't care if you're doing it for all I want is to get a good look at the famous flying ship.

2305
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:26,480
You'd need something very powerful to get a thing like that off the ground. Something so powerful that only I, the muffler, could ever have invented it.

2306
02:23:26,480 --> 02:23:30,480
Remind me one day to show you my famous triangular handkerchief.

2307
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:35,480
Now all we have to do is not dissolve the fuel in water but use the solid fuel.

2308
02:23:35,480 --> 02:23:39,480
Hurry up with that lock, stinky, or maybe I should invent a lock pick.

2309
02:23:39,480 --> 02:23:43,480
Come on, stinky. Hurry, hurry.

2310
02:23:44,480 --> 02:23:45,480
There you are done.

2311
02:23:45,480 --> 02:23:47,480
Good, come. We don't have much time.

2312
02:23:47,480 --> 02:23:58,480
No, I'm dying to steer this ship.

2313
02:23:58,480 --> 02:24:03,480
Oh, stinky, stinky. We're flying at a height of just over 2,000 meters now.

2314
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:05,480
Stinky! Yeah, I'm listening. What is it?

2315
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:10,480
When you hear me say now, that's when I want you to start off the engine immediately.

2316
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:13,480
All right, no problem. I guess it must be this one.

2317
02:24:13,480 --> 02:24:15,480
No, no, not yet. This is it.

2318
02:24:15,480 --> 02:24:20,480
Just a drop of water on the fuel block. Now that should do it.

2319
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:25,480
Can I start it now? Not yet. All right.

2320
02:24:28,480 --> 02:24:34,480
Now, start off the engine stinky. Die, answer.

2321
02:24:34,480 --> 02:24:38,480
Did you really turn on the switch? Yes, I did.

2322
02:24:38,480 --> 02:24:42,480
The engine won't start. Are you quite sure you turned the one I pointed out to you?

2323
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:46,480
I think so. Maybe I turned the wrong one.

2324
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:48,480
Outside these two is where I'll come on.

2325
02:24:48,480 --> 02:24:53,480
Stinky, this is no joke. My reputation as a famous inventor is at stake.

2326
02:24:53,480 --> 02:24:56,480
These two do it, I think. Is that work, Mr. Mapple?

2327
02:24:56,480 --> 02:25:01,480
Nothing is happening. I knew I shouldn't have let you do it better to do it myself.

2328
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:03,480
You're useless. Wait, Mr. Mapple.

2329
02:25:03,480 --> 02:25:06,480
I haven't tried the very last one in the row. This one switched late.

2330
02:25:06,480 --> 02:25:11,480
What? I better throw that one too. You never know. It might just do the trick.

2331
02:25:19,480 --> 02:25:23,480
It works. It works. I know it works. I know it works.

2332
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:25,480
It is working.

2333
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:31,480
I'm not surprised, but I'm so pleased with myself.

2334
02:25:31,480 --> 02:25:37,480
You should be here, Snork. This is my great moment. You should be here to share it with me.

2335
02:25:37,480 --> 02:25:41,480
Come on, I can't wait to try this thing.

2336
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:48,480
Incredible. This ship's arrived.

2337
02:25:48,480 --> 02:25:51,480
This is one of my desert inventions.

2338
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:54,480
Ha, ha, ha!

2339
02:25:57,480 --> 02:26:01,480
Pass! Pass! Pass!

2340
02:26:01,480 --> 02:26:03,480
Pass!

2341
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:10,480
Pass! Pass!

2342
02:26:10,480 --> 02:26:13,480
Pass!

2343
02:26:21,480 --> 02:26:25,480
Come on, let me go! Come on!

2344
02:26:26,480 --> 02:26:32,480
What's your power? I don't think the engine has started up.

2345
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:36,480
I'm very much afraid it's exploding.

2346
02:26:36,480 --> 02:26:39,480
Hey, stinky engines exploding.

2347
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:41,480
Where are you going?

2348
02:26:41,480 --> 02:26:45,480
It's going to explode any minute by wonderful invention.

2349
02:26:45,480 --> 02:26:46,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

2350
02:27:15,480 --> 02:27:45,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh electrodes. Now, come to your nice room on the small side, but the very best one. That explosion, it really was most unexpected, officer. Everybody knows you're a great inventor. I wonder if you could help me, Mr. muffel. Look how? Could you think of something to protect my roses while you're staying with us? An-an explosive, of course.

2351
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:46,480
Of course I couldn't.

2352
02:27:46,480 --> 02:27:48,480
Piece of cake, officer.

2353
02:27:50,480 --> 02:27:52,480
Oh, I really did want to fly.

2354
02:27:54,480 --> 02:27:57,480
Come, come now, cheer up, snorke dear.

2355
02:27:57,480 --> 02:28:00,480
Here you are, a nice cup of tea.

2356
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:01,480
Thanks.

2357
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:08,480
It's very strange, but I had a dream the other night about a flying ship.

2358
02:28:08,480 --> 02:28:11,480
Did you really move in? That sounds very interesting.

2359
02:28:11,480 --> 02:28:13,480
Yes, very interesting.

2360
02:28:13,480 --> 02:28:15,480
Moment, tell me about it.

2361
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:21,480
Yes, it was a peculiar looking ship totally different from your flying ship, snorke.

2362
02:28:21,480 --> 02:28:23,480
Different? Oh.

2363
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:27,480
Well, it was sort of round like this.

2364
02:28:27,480 --> 02:28:31,480
It had a propeller and something hanging underneath.

2365
02:28:31,480 --> 02:28:34,480
And we flew over a high mountain.

2366
02:28:34,480 --> 02:28:36,480
Round?

2367
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:37,480
Yes.

2368
02:28:37,480 --> 02:28:40,480
And you were in a sort of thing hanging underneath.

2369
02:28:40,480 --> 02:28:41,480
Yes.

2370
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:43,480
Round?

2371
02:28:43,480 --> 02:28:45,480
Round, huh?

2372
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:47,480
Round?

2373
02:28:49,480 --> 02:28:51,480
What ever is the matter, snorke?

2374
02:28:51,480 --> 02:28:52,480
What?

2375
02:28:52,480 --> 02:28:54,480
Oh, mama, thanks for the tea.

2376
02:28:54,480 --> 02:28:56,480
I think I'm getting a new idea.

2377
02:28:56,480 --> 02:28:58,480
Moment, see you later.

2378
02:28:58,480 --> 02:29:00,480
Papa, I must go.

2379
02:29:00,480 --> 02:29:02,480
Oh, there he goes again.

2380
02:29:02,480 --> 02:29:04,480
I know that, look, mama.

2381
02:29:04,480 --> 02:29:08,480
You won't get an intelligent answer out of him for the next month or so, honestly.

2382
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:10,480
I'm very happy for him.

2383
02:29:10,480 --> 02:29:14,480
I must say that was a very clever dream you had, moment.

2384
02:29:14,480 --> 02:29:16,480
I'm a better inventor than the model.

2385
02:29:16,480 --> 02:29:20,480
You deserve a triangular acruchy.

2386
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:25,480
So the explosion didn't distress the snort for long.

2387
02:29:25,480 --> 02:29:29,480
Soon he was back at his favorite occupation, planning.

2388
02:29:29,480 --> 02:29:31,480
But planning what?

2389
02:29:31,480 --> 02:29:33,480
Rome?

2390
02:29:39,480 --> 02:29:41,480
Rome?

2391
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:45,480
Yes.

2392
02:29:45,480 --> 02:29:48,480
Rome?

2393
02:29:48,480 --> 02:29:55,480
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

2394
02:29:55,480 --> 02:30:03,480
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2395
02:30:03,480 --> 02:30:06,480
They're always happy and go as it played.

2396
02:30:06,480 --> 02:30:10,480
The movements are having fun day after day.

2397
02:30:10,480 --> 02:30:13,480
The movements.

2398
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:17,480
The movements.

2399
02:30:17,480 --> 02:30:23,480
The movements.

2400
02:30:33,480 --> 02:30:50,480
Here they are for one and all.

2401
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:53,480
The movements are about to come.

2402
02:30:53,480 --> 02:30:56,480
Come on and sit down here with me.

2403
02:30:56,480 --> 02:30:58,480
They're for you on your TV.

2404
02:30:58,480 --> 02:31:01,480
They are the movements.

2405
02:31:01,480 --> 02:31:04,480
They are the movements.

2406
02:31:04,480 --> 02:31:07,480
So come with me, give me your hand.

2407
02:31:07,480 --> 02:31:10,480
I'll take you up to a moment land.

2408
02:31:10,480 --> 02:31:13,480
You can fly just like a bird.

2409
02:31:13,480 --> 02:31:15,480
Sing that song ever.

2410
02:31:15,480 --> 02:31:18,480
There were the movements.

2411
02:31:18,480 --> 02:31:21,480
There were the movements.

2412
02:31:21,480 --> 02:31:24,480
There were the movements.

2413
02:31:24,480 --> 02:31:27,480
There were the movements.

2414
02:31:27,480 --> 02:31:30,480
There were the movements.

2415
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:35,480
There were the movements.

2416
02:31:35,480 --> 02:31:40,480
There were the movements.

2417
02:31:40,480 --> 02:31:43,480
There were the movements.

2418
02:31:43,480 --> 02:31:51,480
There were the movements.

2419
02:31:51,480 --> 02:31:54,480
When the Henry first told movement about the golden fish,

2420
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:59,480
the woman thought to himself that it must look something like that.

2421
02:31:59,480 --> 02:32:08,480
My grandpa told me that his mother had actually seen it.

2422
02:32:08,480 --> 02:32:10,480
So you never saw it yourself, Mr. Hamlin?

2423
02:32:10,480 --> 02:32:12,480
No, I'm a botanist.

2424
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:16,480
It comes to the surface only under very special conditions.

2425
02:32:16,480 --> 02:32:18,480
It's very rarely seen.

2426
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:19,480
Conditions?

2427
02:32:19,480 --> 02:32:20,480
Yes.

2428
02:32:20,480 --> 02:32:23,480
First of all, it must be right between summer and autumn.

2429
02:32:23,480 --> 02:32:25,480
But that's now.

2430
02:32:26,480 --> 02:32:29,480
It has to be in the afternoon sunshine after heavy rain.

2431
02:32:29,480 --> 02:32:31,480
Yes, that does narrow it down.

2432
02:32:31,480 --> 02:32:33,480
And there must be no wind.

2433
02:32:33,480 --> 02:32:36,480
Grandpa said not even a ripple on the water.

2434
02:32:36,480 --> 02:32:37,480
Oh dear.

2435
02:32:37,480 --> 02:32:42,480
And there are some other conditions that he really didn't know about anyway to see it.

2436
02:32:42,480 --> 02:32:44,480
You must be extremely lucky.

2437
02:32:46,480 --> 02:32:49,480
Hmm, just getting to the lake itself isn't too easy.

2438
02:32:49,480 --> 02:32:52,480
It's way beyond lonely mountains.

2439
02:32:53,480 --> 02:32:58,480
Going over lonely mountains and back would take at least two days.

2440
02:32:58,480 --> 02:33:01,480
Not really, because I know a shortcut movement.

2441
02:33:01,480 --> 02:33:03,480
I could take you there and back in one day.

2442
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:05,480
Oh, could you do that?

2443
02:33:05,480 --> 02:33:06,480
Yes.

2444
02:33:06,480 --> 02:33:08,480
Have you already been there, Snuffkin?

2445
02:33:08,480 --> 02:33:10,480
Just once.

2446
02:33:10,480 --> 02:33:12,480
Oh, will you show me the way?

2447
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:13,480
You really want to go?

2448
02:33:13,480 --> 02:33:14,480
Yes.

2449
02:33:14,480 --> 02:33:18,480
I must see that golden fish with my own eyes and maybe capture it.

2450
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:20,480
It won't be easy to capture.

2451
02:33:21,480 --> 02:33:22,480
Why not?

2452
02:33:22,480 --> 02:33:25,480
From what I've heard, the golden fish is far too clever to get caught.

2453
02:33:25,480 --> 02:33:28,480
I know, but it would be so much fun.

2454
02:33:28,480 --> 02:33:29,480
You going alone?

2455
02:33:29,480 --> 02:33:32,480
Well, Snorkmaiden said she wanted to come along.

2456
02:33:32,480 --> 02:33:34,480
She gets these ideas, you know.

2457
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:35,480
Just Snorkmaiden?

2458
02:33:35,480 --> 02:33:36,480
Uh, maybe little Mai.

2459
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:37,480
What about Sniff?

2460
02:33:37,480 --> 02:33:40,480
I think he wants to come along too.

2461
02:33:40,480 --> 02:33:41,480
What would you?

2462
02:33:42,480 --> 02:33:45,480
In that case, we'd better go across the mountains.

2463
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:46,480
Why is that?

2464
02:33:46,480 --> 02:33:47,480
Why can't we take the shortcut?

2465
02:33:48,480 --> 02:33:51,480
The path is rather steep and dangerous, you know, Moomin.

2466
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:53,480
Especially in the forest of witches.

2467
02:33:53,480 --> 02:33:54,480
Hi, the witches?

2468
02:33:54,480 --> 02:33:55,480
Not now, maybe.

2469
02:33:55,480 --> 02:33:57,480
Oh, so it's safe then.

2470
02:33:57,480 --> 02:34:01,480
But it's a very deep forest dark and scary even in daytime.

2471
02:34:04,480 --> 02:34:06,480
That's okay. We'll take the shortcut.

2472
02:34:18,480 --> 02:34:19,480
Oh, dear.

2473
02:34:37,480 --> 02:34:38,480
So long.

2474
02:34:38,480 --> 02:34:48,480
Good morning, Snuffkin!

2475
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:03,480
Sorry, Snuffkin. Guess I overslept.

2476
02:35:03,480 --> 02:35:06,480
Snortmaiden, a little my auntie, yet.

2477
02:35:06,480 --> 02:35:08,480
You're very early.

2478
02:35:08,480 --> 02:35:12,480
I dreamt I caught the golden fish, and then, of course, I couldn't go back to sleep.

2479
02:35:12,480 --> 02:35:14,480
Well, let's go.

2480
02:35:14,480 --> 02:35:16,480
Shouldn't we wait for Snortmaiden and little my?

2481
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:19,480
Oh, they're not really great walkers, are they?

2482
02:35:19,480 --> 02:35:23,480
And anyway, didn't we decide that we wouldn't wait for anybody?

2483
02:35:23,480 --> 02:35:25,480
So it might be better this way.

2484
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:27,480
What's better this way, woman?

2485
02:35:27,480 --> 02:35:29,480
Oh, little my!

2486
02:35:29,480 --> 02:35:31,480
Why don't you stay here?

2487
02:35:31,480 --> 02:35:33,480
This will be a very tough expedition.

2488
02:35:33,480 --> 02:35:35,480
I'm tougher than you.

2489
02:35:35,480 --> 02:35:37,480
Wait for me!

2490
02:35:43,480 --> 02:35:45,480
Hey, walk any faster, Snuffkin.

2491
02:35:45,480 --> 02:35:47,480
I'm still so sleepy.

2492
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:51,480
Why did we have to leave so early, moving?

2493
02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:53,480
To get there, back in a day, Snortmaiden.

2494
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:55,480
But we aren't taking the shortcut, are we?

2495
02:35:55,480 --> 02:35:58,480
Yes, but it still might get dark before we're back.

2496
02:35:58,480 --> 02:36:01,480
I won't be able to walk back this fast, you know,

2497
02:36:01,480 --> 02:36:04,480
because my bucket will be full of water for the golden fish.

2498
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:07,480
Well, don't be disappointed if you don't catch it.

2499
02:36:07,480 --> 02:36:09,480
But that's my whole reason for going!

2500
02:36:09,480 --> 02:36:11,480
But you heard what the Himmelin said, Snuff?

2501
02:36:11,480 --> 02:36:15,480
We'll be extremely lucky to even catch sight of the golden fish.

2502
02:36:15,480 --> 02:36:17,480
I heard him, and now's exactly the right time.

2503
02:36:17,480 --> 02:36:20,480
Maybe the others made too much noise.

2504
02:36:20,480 --> 02:36:22,480
We'll just have to wait and see.

2505
02:36:22,480 --> 02:36:25,480
Don't you worry, I'll catch him all right.

2506
02:36:35,480 --> 02:36:36,480
Where are they?

2507
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:38,480
We're going sorely in the morning.

2508
02:36:41,480 --> 02:36:43,480
How far is the forest of witches?

2509
02:36:43,480 --> 02:36:45,480
I'd say about two hours.

2510
02:36:45,480 --> 02:36:50,480
And can you also tell us how long from one end of the forest to the other, Snuffkin?

2511
02:36:50,480 --> 02:36:52,480
About the same.

2512
02:36:55,480 --> 02:36:57,480
Are there really such things as witches?

2513
02:36:57,480 --> 02:36:58,480
No.

2514
02:36:58,480 --> 02:37:00,480
Baby, because I'm not a bit scared of them.

2515
02:37:00,480 --> 02:37:01,480
Aren't you?

2516
02:37:01,480 --> 02:37:03,480
Not the least little bit.

2517
02:37:03,480 --> 02:37:04,480
There used to be some, though.

2518
02:37:04,480 --> 02:37:05,480
What, witches?

2519
02:37:05,480 --> 02:37:06,480
Well, of course, Snuff.

2520
02:37:06,480 --> 02:37:09,480
What else do you think that they call it the forest of witches, huh?

2521
02:37:09,480 --> 02:37:13,480
And you're absolutely sure that there are no witches now.

2522
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:15,480
I haven't heard of any coming back.

2523
02:37:16,480 --> 02:37:20,480
So you're not absolutely sure that there are no witches.

2524
02:37:27,480 --> 02:37:29,480
Where's Moomeyerner still in bed?

2525
02:37:29,480 --> 02:37:32,480
He was off before you woke up, Papa.

2526
02:37:33,480 --> 02:37:36,480
Oh, the golden fish.

2527
02:37:36,480 --> 02:37:38,480
Good morning, dear.

2528
02:37:38,480 --> 02:37:40,480
I wanted to go with them.

2529
02:37:40,480 --> 02:37:43,480
But you're writing your memoirs you're far too busy.

2530
02:37:43,480 --> 02:37:47,480
And that's very true with the sort of a fish that no one has seen.

2531
02:37:47,480 --> 02:37:50,480
That might have been a whole chapter.

2532
02:37:50,480 --> 02:37:52,480
Do you think they'll catch it?

2533
02:37:52,480 --> 02:37:55,480
No, I doubt it very much. It's highly unlikely.

2534
02:37:55,480 --> 02:37:57,480
In that case, you should have gone with them.

2535
02:37:57,480 --> 02:38:00,480
No, I do know a thing or two bad fishing.

2536
02:38:00,480 --> 02:38:03,480
Snuffkin does, too, but he's still so young.

2537
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:06,480
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure Snuffkin will manage.

2538
02:38:07,480 --> 02:38:10,480
Oh, this is a spooky forest.

2539
02:38:10,480 --> 02:38:12,480
Maybe the witch is every time.

2540
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:14,480
Stop it, little mind.

2541
02:38:14,480 --> 02:38:16,480
Listen, everybody. Don't stray away from me.

2542
02:38:16,480 --> 02:38:18,480
Promise you might get lost.

2543
02:38:30,480 --> 02:38:32,480
Oh, it's so dark in here.

2544
02:38:32,480 --> 02:38:36,480
Sure, isn't so thick the sun can't get through.

2545
02:38:38,480 --> 02:38:40,480
That's because of those clouds.

2546
02:39:00,480 --> 02:39:02,480
I can hear the wind.

2547
02:39:02,480 --> 02:39:04,480
But we need calm.

2548
02:39:04,480 --> 02:39:06,480
Yeah, but we also need heavy rain.

2549
02:39:06,480 --> 02:39:08,480
You're right, that's what the Hemiellin said.

2550
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:10,480
It sure looks like rain.

2551
02:39:10,480 --> 02:39:12,480
Not only looks like...

2552
02:39:14,480 --> 02:39:16,480
Oh, it's raining.

2553
02:39:31,480 --> 02:39:32,480
Here.

2554
02:39:32,480 --> 02:39:34,480
Oh, thank you.

2555
02:39:38,480 --> 02:39:40,480
I gotta say this rainstorm was very sudden.

2556
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:42,480
Don't worry, it won't last that long.

2557
02:39:42,480 --> 02:39:44,480
How do you know that?

2558
02:39:44,480 --> 02:39:46,480
Vagabons do.

2559
02:39:46,480 --> 02:39:48,480
This rain isn't that heavy.

2560
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:50,480
No, it's not bad, but we better hurryer.

2561
02:39:50,480 --> 02:39:54,480
We won't get to the lake till noon, and that'll be too late.

2562
02:39:54,480 --> 02:39:57,480
I don't think we'll get very wet down here, Mum.

2563
02:39:57,480 --> 02:39:59,480
And so why don't we move on?

2564
02:39:59,480 --> 02:40:01,480
I'm excited.

2565
02:40:01,480 --> 02:40:03,480
What should we do, it's nothing.

2566
02:40:03,480 --> 02:40:05,480
Well, we could move on, couldn't we?

2567
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:07,480
Yeah.

2568
02:40:13,480 --> 02:40:15,480
Yeah!

2569
02:40:23,480 --> 02:40:25,480
We really are getting too wet.

2570
02:40:25,480 --> 02:40:27,480
We better find some shelter quickly.

2571
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:29,480
But where can we shelter?

2572
02:40:29,480 --> 02:40:31,480
There's nothing in this wood-except tree.

2573
02:40:31,480 --> 02:40:33,480
On your tree, then, I guess.

2574
02:40:33,480 --> 02:40:35,480
Yeah!

2575
02:40:35,480 --> 02:40:37,480
What is it, Snorke, Nathan?

2576
02:40:37,480 --> 02:40:39,480
There's a house over there.

2577
02:40:45,480 --> 02:40:47,480
It's falling to wreck and ruin.

2578
02:40:47,480 --> 02:40:49,480
Well, at least it'll keep the rain off.

2579
02:40:57,480 --> 02:40:59,480
Yeah!

2580
02:41:07,480 --> 02:41:09,480
Hello there!

2581
02:41:09,480 --> 02:41:11,480
Anyone home?

2582
02:41:11,480 --> 02:41:13,480
There's nobody here.

2583
02:41:23,480 --> 02:41:26,480
No one's lived here for a long time.

2584
02:41:26,480 --> 02:41:30,480
I wonder who could have been who lived here all alone.

2585
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:42,480
I know who it was.

2586
02:41:42,480 --> 02:41:44,480
And so do we all.

2587
02:41:44,480 --> 02:41:46,480
Surely you don't mean.

2588
02:41:46,480 --> 02:41:48,480
The Witches, of course.

2589
02:41:48,480 --> 02:41:54,480
Look around for dried spices, magic herbs, brums, sticks, and a black cat.

2590
02:41:54,480 --> 02:41:56,480
A niren pot.

2591
02:41:56,480 --> 02:41:58,480
A pile.

2592
02:41:58,480 --> 02:42:00,480
But no, bro.

2593
02:42:00,480 --> 02:42:02,480
No, the Witch rode away on it.

2594
02:42:06,480 --> 02:42:08,480
There's someone here.

2595
02:42:08,480 --> 02:42:10,480
Who is it?

2596
02:42:16,480 --> 02:42:18,480
Let's get out of here.

2597
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:20,480
Came from over there.

2598
02:42:24,480 --> 02:42:26,480
No, don't.

2599
02:42:26,480 --> 02:42:28,480
That's okay, Snorke.

2600
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:30,480
We gotta get out of this place.

2601
02:42:40,480 --> 02:42:42,480
Oh, I can't move, Snorke, Nathan.

2602
02:42:42,480 --> 02:42:44,480
Stinky?

2603
02:42:48,480 --> 02:42:50,480
Pretty good.

2604
02:42:50,480 --> 02:42:52,480
I bet you were really scared.

2605
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:56,480
It's very rude of sniff to faint when he hears my voice.

2606
02:42:56,480 --> 02:43:00,480
Where are you off to anyway?

2607
02:43:00,480 --> 02:43:02,480
Oh, come on, tell me.

2608
02:43:02,480 --> 02:43:04,480
Can't you even take a joke?

2609
02:43:04,480 --> 02:43:06,480
Come on, wait for me.

2610
02:43:06,480 --> 02:43:08,480
Okay.

2611
02:43:20,480 --> 02:43:22,480
That way.

2612
02:43:22,480 --> 02:43:24,480
Okay.

2613
02:43:24,480 --> 02:43:26,480
Come on.

2614
02:43:36,480 --> 02:44:04,200
This is it isn't it yes it is where's the golden fish I really don't know I've never seen it either

2615
02:44:04,200 --> 02:44:12,640
with rain sunshine and calm I'm sure all the fish will come the golden fish help me catch it I just got to have that golden fish

2616
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:42,040
oh it's deep down in here somewhere I can't see any fish anywhere

2617
02:44:42,040 --> 02:44:55,120
maybe it was a very funny joke the hamula doesn't show let's sit down and wait I'm sure the golden fish will appear for us I don't believe it do me

2618
02:44:55,120 --> 02:45:02,040
to say you came all this way here just to see some stupid old fish I came to catch it well that's even more stupid

2619
02:45:02,040 --> 02:45:15,600
they stopped making those ripples so they really got excited and walked all the way you say oh to be young again well I would have gone

2620
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:22,680
with them if I hadn't over slept I didn't know that you were that young woman Papa I'm not exactly old you know

2621
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:29,880
pretty interesting to see a fish that hardly anyone's ever seen sniff said that he would catch this

2622
02:45:29,880 --> 02:45:37,200
golden fish if it's the last thing he did oh well he had a net and a very large bucket to carry at home

2623
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:46,800
and that's a good one what do you mean I guess I must have forgotten to tell you all the details there's

2624
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:57,000
so much you don't know about this fish

2625
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:06,000
the hamula was certainly right hardly anyone has seen this golden fish and we're not gonna see it either

2626
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:15,360
maybe somebody ate him years ago stinky be quiet please did you see it where did you see it

2627
02:46:15,360 --> 02:46:25,240
huh I saw a fish jump but I couldn't tell if it was golden it was much too far away with the sun over

2628
02:46:25,240 --> 02:46:32,120
there we just see the outlines norc maiden yes we couldn't really see the color look everybody look I can see

2629
02:46:32,120 --> 02:46:40,520
your raft over there hey let's take it and go on to the middle of the lake but it's much too small for all of us

2630
02:46:40,520 --> 02:46:50,600
don't worry sniff this won't sink I'm staying you do what you like but you'll never catch any fish if

2631
02:46:50,600 --> 02:46:58,880
you're afraid of water stinky you can help me it's gold you know we can sell it for a lot of money

2632
02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:16,320
and then we'll both be very wealthy I think it was somewhere around here wasn't it or unless I

2633
02:47:16,320 --> 02:47:25,960
suppose hard to say well I can't see anything I did see there's certainly no sign of it now well we'll

2634
02:47:25,960 --> 02:47:34,200
just have to sit and wait here we've no choice I'm not going home until I've seen it I'm happy to wait

2635
02:47:34,200 --> 02:47:40,920
all day you won't find it by looking up at the sky you know what fish like it in places where there

2636
02:47:40,920 --> 02:47:47,800
are lots of wings oh the rafts in the middle of the lake and they just want to see the fish but you

2637
02:47:47,800 --> 02:47:53,640
wait I'm going to catch it maybe somebody's already caught it and you can get it in the tin

2638
02:48:00,200 --> 02:48:06,040
over there something shiny jumping see I told you now keep quiet

2639
02:48:18,120 --> 02:48:27,000
I hate fishing guess we better think about getting back otherwise we'll never get home before nightfall

2640
02:48:27,800 --> 02:48:33,160
I don't want to get lost on a raft in the dark on this lonely lake perhaps we were expecting too much

2641
02:48:34,760 --> 02:48:40,360
maybe your right snort maiden but I really thought we'd see it this is the most disappointing day of my

2642
02:48:40,360 --> 02:48:43,720
life we can come back yes

2643
02:48:48,120 --> 02:48:50,120
oh

2644
02:48:56,120 --> 02:48:58,120
it's not going to stop

2645
02:49:02,920 --> 02:49:05,080
now did you see a moment

2646
02:49:18,360 --> 02:49:24,520
oh

2647
02:49:27,720 --> 02:49:30,920
it's gigantic

2648
02:49:47,800 --> 02:50:17,800
I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't

2649
02:50:17,800 --> 02:50:47,800
know what I'm going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do,

2650
02:50:47,800 --> 02:50:49,800
I did it! I caught it!

2651
02:50:49,800 --> 02:50:50,800
Pardon what?

2652
02:50:50,800 --> 02:50:52,800
Why the golden fish, of course?

2653
02:50:52,800 --> 02:50:53,800
What?

2654
02:50:53,800 --> 02:50:56,800
I've got the golden fish in here if you want to have a look at it.

2655
02:50:56,800 --> 02:50:58,800
See? It's in this bucket.

2656
02:50:58,800 --> 02:51:00,800
Huh?

2657
02:51:00,800 --> 02:51:03,800
You don't really believe that is the golden fish.

2658
02:51:03,800 --> 02:51:05,800
Huh? Huh?

2659
02:51:05,800 --> 02:51:08,800
It's just another stupid fish.

2660
02:51:08,800 --> 02:51:11,800
I can swear that it really was golden when I caught it.

2661
02:51:11,800 --> 02:51:15,800
It must have been the sun making it land in the water.

2662
02:51:15,800 --> 02:51:17,800
It was you said it was the golden fish.

2663
02:51:17,800 --> 02:51:19,800
Why don't you let it go?

2664
02:51:19,800 --> 02:51:22,800
You know it's not the right one and he hates it in that bucket.

2665
02:51:22,800 --> 02:51:24,800
Huh?

2666
02:51:29,800 --> 02:51:32,800
There he goes. It looks so happy now.

2667
02:51:32,800 --> 02:51:35,800
It really was gold when I first saw it.

2668
02:51:35,800 --> 02:51:37,800
We believe you sniff.

2669
02:51:37,800 --> 02:51:39,800
Now let's go home.

2670
02:51:45,800 --> 02:51:53,800
Steph and Stinky never really got home together.

2671
02:51:53,800 --> 02:51:57,800
They believed it was actually the golden fish they had caught.

2672
02:51:57,800 --> 02:52:01,800
But moving in the others were in no doubt about what they had seen.

2673
02:52:01,800 --> 02:52:04,800
They are the emulators of Great Britain.

2674
02:52:15,800 --> 02:52:21,800
They believe in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

2675
02:52:21,800 --> 02:52:25,800
They're always happy and goes at play.

2676
02:52:25,800 --> 02:52:29,800
The movements are having fun day after day.

2677
02:52:29,800 --> 02:52:32,800
The movements.

2678
02:52:32,800 --> 02:52:36,800
The movements.

2679
02:52:36,800 --> 02:52:42,800
The movements.

2680
02:52:45,800 --> 02:52:52,800
The movements.

2681
02:53:15,800 --> 02:53:22,800
They are the movements.

2682
02:53:22,800 --> 02:53:25,800
They are the movements.

2683
02:53:25,800 --> 02:53:28,800
So come with me, give me your hand.

2684
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:31,800
I'll take you up to a moment land.

2685
02:53:31,800 --> 02:53:34,800
You can fly just like a bird.

2686
02:53:34,800 --> 02:53:36,800
Sing that song ever.

2687
02:53:36,800 --> 02:53:39,800
There were the movements.

2688
02:53:39,800 --> 02:53:43,800
There were the movements.

2689
02:53:43,800 --> 02:53:48,800
There were the movements.

2690
02:53:48,800 --> 02:53:53,800
There were the movements.

2691
02:53:53,800 --> 02:54:02,800
Snort Maiden was in a very good mood.

2692
02:54:02,800 --> 02:54:06,800
Because that day she was off to collect shells of the sea shore with moon.

2693
02:54:06,800 --> 02:54:16,800
Moonman.

2694
02:54:16,800 --> 02:54:25,800
Hey look, the sun's up and there's Gracie.

2695
02:54:25,800 --> 02:54:29,800
What's the matter Papa?

2696
02:54:29,800 --> 02:54:31,800
What's your moment?

2697
02:54:31,800 --> 02:54:32,800
What are you doing?

2698
02:54:32,800 --> 02:54:35,800
I heard you talking to yourself just now.

2699
02:54:35,800 --> 02:54:39,800
Oh.

2700
02:54:39,800 --> 02:54:42,800
You see this? I'm writing a play.

2701
02:54:42,800 --> 02:54:43,800
Writing a play.

2702
02:54:43,800 --> 02:54:45,800
You remember the last children?

2703
02:54:45,800 --> 02:54:47,800
That was a very successful play.

2704
02:54:47,800 --> 02:54:49,800
Just now I was repeating a line.

2705
02:54:49,800 --> 02:54:53,800
Hey look, another beautiful day and there goes Gracie.

2706
02:54:53,800 --> 02:54:56,800
It's a wonderful line, of course.

2707
02:54:56,800 --> 02:54:57,800
Don't you agree?

2708
02:54:57,800 --> 02:54:59,800
It could be improved.

2709
02:54:59,800 --> 02:55:02,800
I think about it.

2710
02:55:02,800 --> 02:55:05,800
Yeah.

2711
02:55:05,800 --> 02:55:15,800
Well, wait, wait, look at this.

2712
02:55:15,800 --> 02:55:20,800
Beautiful.

2713
02:55:20,800 --> 02:55:21,800
You find anything?

2714
02:55:21,800 --> 02:55:30,800
No, just usual old stuff.

2715
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:33,800
Oh, there's another big one.

2716
02:55:33,800 --> 02:55:38,800
Can't you really find anything, Moonman?

2717
02:55:38,800 --> 02:55:40,800
I'll look somewhere else.

2718
02:55:40,800 --> 02:55:42,800
I still think this is the best place.

2719
02:55:42,800 --> 02:55:46,800
Well, I'm going over there.

2720
02:55:46,800 --> 02:55:50,800
You're so beautiful.

2721
02:55:50,800 --> 02:55:54,800
Oh.

2722
02:55:54,800 --> 02:55:56,800
What are you doing, Moonman?

2723
02:55:56,800 --> 02:55:58,800
No, that's no shell surely.

2724
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:00,800
Oh, so why did you take it out?

2725
02:56:00,800 --> 02:56:05,800
Well, once you see it, you want to find out what it is.

2726
02:56:05,800 --> 02:56:07,800
A very odd thing, isn't it?

2727
02:56:07,800 --> 02:56:10,800
Not very interesting.

2728
02:56:14,800 --> 02:56:16,800
Oh no, I can see what it is.

2729
02:56:16,800 --> 02:56:18,800
I gave it a good wash.

2730
02:56:18,800 --> 02:56:20,800
I see one just like it in the fairy tales.

2731
02:56:20,800 --> 02:56:21,800
It's an old lamp.

2732
02:56:21,800 --> 02:56:24,800
Yes, you remember the story called a ladder?

2733
02:56:24,800 --> 02:56:26,800
He rubbed the lamp and the genie appeared.

2734
02:56:26,800 --> 02:56:30,800
The genie might appear for us if we do what Aladdin did.

2735
02:56:30,800 --> 02:56:33,800
Don't be silly, Snork Maiden.

2736
02:56:33,800 --> 02:56:36,800
Hmm.

2737
02:56:36,800 --> 02:56:40,800
But Snork Maiden, that was a fairy tale.

2738
02:56:40,800 --> 02:56:43,800
Don't laugh, I just want to make absolutely sure.

2739
02:56:43,800 --> 02:56:46,800
The tell you the truth, I've already tried it.

2740
02:56:46,800 --> 02:56:49,800
My hands turned green, that's all that happened to me.

2741
02:56:49,800 --> 02:56:51,800
Maybe you didn't do it the right way.

2742
02:56:51,800 --> 02:56:54,800
You can't even whip cream properly.

2743
02:56:54,800 --> 02:56:57,800
And I'm sure you have to say some magic words,

2744
02:56:57,800 --> 02:57:00,800
such as, apricot dapura, spirit, come forth,

2745
02:57:00,800 --> 02:57:03,800
apricot dapura, try for all your words.

2746
02:57:03,800 --> 02:57:05,800
You've chosen the wrong words.

2747
02:57:05,800 --> 02:57:08,800
You should say, come out, say something or something.

2748
02:57:08,800 --> 02:57:09,800
Huh?

2749
02:57:09,800 --> 02:57:11,800
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness!

2750
02:57:11,800 --> 02:57:13,800
Keep going, Snork Maiden.

2751
02:57:13,800 --> 02:57:15,800
Ah!

2752
02:57:15,800 --> 02:57:19,800
I am the spirit of the lamp.

2753
02:57:19,800 --> 02:57:22,800
What is your command?

2754
02:57:22,800 --> 02:57:26,800
Goodness, did you come out of this lamp?

2755
02:57:26,800 --> 02:57:27,800
You got it.

2756
02:57:27,800 --> 02:57:30,800
So you really are the spirit of this lamp?

2757
02:57:30,800 --> 02:57:31,800
Always have been.

2758
02:57:31,800 --> 02:57:35,800
But, but I have the book and you're not him.

2759
02:57:35,800 --> 02:57:37,800
I can't believe it.

2760
02:57:37,800 --> 02:57:39,800
I've never heard of it before.

2761
02:57:39,800 --> 02:57:41,800
I've never heard of it before.

2762
02:57:41,800 --> 02:57:43,800
I've never heard of it before.

2763
02:57:43,800 --> 02:57:44,800
You're not him.

2764
02:57:44,800 --> 02:57:48,800
I can prove it if you're quite sure you want me to.

2765
02:57:48,800 --> 02:57:51,800
By all means, it probably wasn't a good picture.

2766
02:57:51,800 --> 02:57:54,800
I'm the one and only spirit of the lamp.

2767
02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:58,800
Ah, then you must have the power to make any wish come true.

2768
02:57:58,800 --> 02:57:59,800
Is that so?

2769
02:57:59,800 --> 02:58:01,800
Her wish, certainly, but not yours.

2770
02:58:01,800 --> 02:58:03,800
But I'm the one who'll dug you out.

2771
02:58:03,800 --> 02:58:05,800
That's not so important, kid.

2772
02:58:05,800 --> 02:58:08,800
She's the one who summoned me forth from the lamp.

2773
02:58:08,800 --> 02:58:10,800
What are we going to do about this spirit?

2774
02:58:10,800 --> 02:58:11,800
Why?

2775
02:58:11,800 --> 02:58:12,800
Ask for something.

2776
02:58:12,800 --> 02:58:14,800
Ask for something you've always wanted.

2777
02:58:14,800 --> 02:58:16,800
Ah, let's see.

2778
02:58:16,800 --> 02:58:17,800
A pearl necklace.

2779
02:58:17,800 --> 02:58:18,800
Sorry, me.

2780
02:58:18,800 --> 02:58:20,800
Your wish is my command.

2781
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:23,800
Hey, wait a minute.

2782
02:58:23,800 --> 02:58:24,800
Oh.

2783
02:58:24,800 --> 02:58:27,800
A pearl necklace is only one of the things I wanted.

2784
02:58:27,800 --> 02:58:28,800
I hadn't decided yet.

2785
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:30,800
Don't worry, Snork Maiden.

2786
02:58:30,800 --> 02:58:32,800
I guess you can always send it back.

2787
02:58:32,800 --> 02:58:35,800
If I like the necklace, then it's your turn to wrap the lamp.

2788
02:58:35,800 --> 02:58:37,800
Then you can wish for whatever you've always wanted.

2789
02:58:37,800 --> 02:58:38,800
Yes.

2790
02:58:39,800 --> 02:58:41,800
But where exactly did you rub the lamp?

2791
02:58:41,800 --> 02:58:44,800
Right here, and very, very slowly.

2792
02:58:44,800 --> 02:58:45,800
All right.

2793
02:58:45,800 --> 02:58:47,800
I'll say, spirit come forth.

2794
02:58:47,800 --> 02:58:50,800
It sounds a little better than come out, spirit.

2795
02:58:56,800 --> 02:58:57,800
Oh, nice.

2796
02:58:57,800 --> 02:58:59,800
What was that?

2797
02:58:59,800 --> 02:59:00,800
Always back.

2798
02:59:05,800 --> 02:59:07,800
One royal necklace, Miss.

2799
02:59:08,800 --> 02:59:10,800
This is incredible.

2800
02:59:10,800 --> 02:59:11,800
Right.

2801
02:59:11,800 --> 02:59:14,800
I do think this is exactly what I wanted.

2802
02:59:14,800 --> 02:59:16,800
Oh, thank you ever so much.

2803
02:59:16,800 --> 02:59:17,800
All in a day's wake.

2804
02:59:17,800 --> 02:59:19,800
So pleased to oblige, Miss.

2805
02:59:22,800 --> 02:59:24,800
Are you going back into the lamp?

2806
02:59:24,800 --> 02:59:25,800
Yes, I am.

2807
02:59:25,800 --> 02:59:26,800
I'm so happy.

2808
02:59:26,800 --> 02:59:28,800
Now it's my turn to let you out of here.

2809
02:59:28,800 --> 02:59:31,800
I'd like to have a wish granted, too, please.

2810
02:59:31,800 --> 02:59:33,800
Now, wait a minute.

2811
02:59:33,800 --> 02:59:35,800
If getting in and out is a bother,

2812
02:59:35,800 --> 02:59:38,800
why don't you let me give you my wish right now?

2813
02:59:38,800 --> 02:59:39,800
Can't do it, young man.

2814
02:59:39,800 --> 02:59:41,800
One at a time in the face to call.

2815
02:59:41,800 --> 02:59:43,800
Just wanted to save time.

2816
02:59:43,800 --> 02:59:45,800
Impossible, young say.

2817
02:59:45,800 --> 02:59:46,800
But why?

2818
02:59:46,800 --> 02:59:49,800
Because I am only able to fulfill one wish a week.

2819
02:59:49,800 --> 02:59:51,800
I need my rest.

2820
02:59:51,800 --> 02:59:52,800
It's hard work, you know.

2821
02:59:52,800 --> 02:59:55,800
Oh, well, of course it's tiring.

2822
02:59:55,800 --> 02:59:57,800
Perhaps I expected too much from you.

2823
02:59:57,800 --> 02:59:58,800
Hold on.

2824
02:59:58,800 --> 03:00:00,800
I wouldn't like you to think that I haven't got the power.

2825
03:00:00,800 --> 03:00:03,800
I can do many extraordinary things.

2826
03:00:03,800 --> 03:00:04,800
What kind of things?

2827
03:00:04,800 --> 03:00:05,800
Not telling you.

2828
03:00:12,800 --> 03:00:13,800
Listen, moment.

2829
03:00:13,800 --> 03:00:15,800
We won't tell a soul about this lamp, alright?

2830
03:00:15,800 --> 03:00:16,800
Of course not.

2831
03:00:35,800 --> 03:00:36,800
No!

2832
03:00:36,800 --> 03:00:38,800
Names don't really matter.

2833
03:00:38,800 --> 03:00:41,800
Tulip Hydrangea, who cares?

2834
03:00:41,800 --> 03:00:43,800
No, that's not right somehow.

2835
03:00:43,800 --> 03:00:45,800
And uranium, a fox glove.

2836
03:00:45,800 --> 03:00:47,800
Oh, I'm so tired.

2837
03:01:05,800 --> 03:01:07,800
Oh, yeah.

2838
03:01:16,800 --> 03:01:18,800
Hmm.

2839
03:01:18,800 --> 03:01:21,800
Praise the lad and I didn't tell them I can get out at night.

2840
03:01:21,800 --> 03:01:23,800
I'd have no peace at all.

2841
03:01:23,800 --> 03:01:26,800
My leisure time would be totally ruined by these two.

2842
03:01:26,800 --> 03:01:30,800
Good thing also I can read their minds so I know what I'm up against.

2843
03:01:30,800 --> 03:01:33,800
They're up to something I know they are.

2844
03:01:34,800 --> 03:01:38,800
Oh, yes, dear me, dear me.

2845
03:01:38,800 --> 03:01:41,800
No wonder the young man is worried to death.

2846
03:01:41,800 --> 03:01:42,800
She was.

2847
03:01:42,800 --> 03:01:44,800
I better rewrite this.

2848
03:01:44,800 --> 03:01:49,800
Oh, Edgar, Edgar, I do wish you was somebody else.

2849
03:01:49,800 --> 03:01:52,800
This will certainly have to be changed.

2850
03:01:52,800 --> 03:01:54,800
The whole page, really.

2851
03:01:55,800 --> 03:01:58,800
What's going on here?

2852
03:01:58,800 --> 03:02:01,800
Who did this?

2853
03:02:01,800 --> 03:02:04,800
Mom, not you surely.

2854
03:02:04,800 --> 03:02:05,800
What?

2855
03:02:05,800 --> 03:02:06,800
What?

2856
03:02:06,800 --> 03:02:07,800
What?

2857
03:02:07,800 --> 03:02:08,800
What?

2858
03:02:08,800 --> 03:02:09,800
What?

2859
03:02:09,800 --> 03:02:10,800
What?

2860
03:02:10,800 --> 03:02:11,800
What?

2861
03:02:11,800 --> 03:02:12,800
What?

2862
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:13,800
What?

2863
03:02:13,800 --> 03:02:14,800
What?

2864
03:02:14,800 --> 03:02:15,800
What?

2865
03:02:15,800 --> 03:02:16,800
What?

2866
03:02:16,800 --> 03:02:17,800
What?

2867
03:02:17,800 --> 03:02:18,800
What?

2868
03:02:18,800 --> 03:02:19,800
What?

2869
03:02:19,800 --> 03:02:20,800
What?

2870
03:02:20,800 --> 03:02:21,800
What?

2871
03:02:21,800 --> 03:02:22,800
What?

2872
03:02:22,800 --> 03:02:23,800
What?

2873
03:02:23,800 --> 03:02:24,800
What?

2874
03:02:24,800 --> 03:02:25,800
What?

2875
03:02:25,800 --> 03:02:27,800
Some rascals have been rewriting my play.

2876
03:02:27,800 --> 03:02:29,800
Who could that possibly be?

2877
03:02:29,800 --> 03:02:32,800
Who in need in the middle of the night while I was asleep?

2878
03:02:32,800 --> 03:02:34,800
It's very strange, isn't it, Papa?

2879
03:02:34,800 --> 03:02:36,800
It can't be you, Mom.

2880
03:02:36,800 --> 03:02:38,800
Of course not, Papa.

2881
03:02:38,800 --> 03:02:40,800
I am upset.

2882
03:02:40,800 --> 03:02:41,800
Who can it be?

2883
03:02:41,800 --> 03:02:44,800
Imagine going into your study while you were fast asleep.

2884
03:02:44,800 --> 03:02:46,800
It's very rude, isn't it?

2885
03:02:46,800 --> 03:02:49,800
I find it incredible that anyone could do such a thing.

2886
03:02:49,800 --> 03:02:52,800
And all the rewriting was done on those bits as I knew

2887
03:02:52,800 --> 03:02:54,800
weren't perfectly polished.

2888
03:02:54,800 --> 03:02:58,800
Listen, dear, I'm sure they were far too good for him to improve on.

2889
03:02:58,800 --> 03:03:00,800
No, no, you're wrong.

2890
03:03:00,800 --> 03:03:02,800
That's the worst thing.

2891
03:03:02,800 --> 03:03:04,800
I must admit he did improve them.

2892
03:03:04,800 --> 03:03:07,800
Then I think you should feel pleased, dear.

2893
03:03:07,800 --> 03:03:08,800
Yes.

2894
03:03:08,800 --> 03:03:10,800
No, I'm not a bit pleased.

2895
03:03:10,800 --> 03:03:12,800
A dramatist should write his own plays.

2896
03:03:12,800 --> 03:03:14,800
Looks great, Snork Maiden.

2897
03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:16,800
That is, if you like necklaces.

2898
03:03:16,800 --> 03:03:18,800
Thank you, Little Maiden.

2899
03:03:18,800 --> 03:03:20,800
It was given to me as a present.

2900
03:03:20,800 --> 03:03:21,800
Rather nice.

2901
03:03:21,800 --> 03:03:23,800
Would you mind if I tried it on for a minute?

2902
03:03:23,800 --> 03:03:24,800
Of course not.

2903
03:03:24,800 --> 03:03:26,800
I'm sure you'll look gorgeous.

2904
03:03:26,800 --> 03:03:30,800
I suppose in time one could get to like necklaces.

2905
03:03:30,800 --> 03:03:33,800
I could ask for a similar one for you.

2906
03:03:33,800 --> 03:03:36,800
Deepers, who's your rich friend?

2907
03:03:36,800 --> 03:03:37,800
Yes.

2908
03:03:37,800 --> 03:03:41,800
I searched the whole house, but I can't find it anywhere.

2909
03:03:41,800 --> 03:03:43,800
Someone must have stolen it.

2910
03:03:43,800 --> 03:03:47,800
The three Mrs. Philly Junk, I fully expect to arrest the thief any minute now.

2911
03:03:47,800 --> 03:03:49,800
Good afternoon, Inspector.

2912
03:03:49,800 --> 03:03:50,800
Hello, Snork Maiden.

2913
03:03:50,800 --> 03:03:52,800
Please hurry, Inspector.

2914
03:03:52,800 --> 03:03:55,800
The thief has almost certainly left Moomin Valley already.

2915
03:03:55,800 --> 03:03:56,800
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

2916
03:03:56,800 --> 03:03:58,800
Nothing is safe in this valley anymore.

2917
03:03:58,800 --> 03:04:00,800
Now calm down, Mrs. Philly Junk.

2918
03:04:00,800 --> 03:04:04,800
Did you just say you've had something stolen, Mrs. Philly Junk?

2919
03:04:04,800 --> 03:04:08,800
My pearl necklace, extraordinarily beautiful pearls, 87 of them.

2920
03:04:08,800 --> 03:04:11,800
Looks just like the one you're wearing, Little Maiden.

2921
03:04:11,800 --> 03:04:14,800
You stole it.

2922
03:04:14,800 --> 03:04:16,800
Did you?

2923
03:04:16,800 --> 03:04:17,800
Oh!

2924
03:04:17,800 --> 03:04:18,800
Oh, no, no!

2925
03:04:18,800 --> 03:04:19,800
What are you doing?

2926
03:04:19,800 --> 03:04:20,800
What are you doing?

2927
03:04:20,800 --> 03:04:21,800
Doctor!

2928
03:04:21,800 --> 03:04:22,800
Doctor!

2929
03:04:22,800 --> 03:04:23,800
Arrest her!

2930
03:04:23,800 --> 03:04:25,800
First, believe her she's a bee, she's innocent!

2931
03:04:25,800 --> 03:04:27,800
Little Maiden's beauty!

2932
03:04:27,800 --> 03:04:30,800
The smallest character of the most cunning and generous!

2933
03:04:30,800 --> 03:04:31,800
Yes!

2934
03:04:31,800 --> 03:04:34,800
This is Snork Maiden's necklace.

2935
03:04:34,800 --> 03:04:36,800
No, that's very funny, Mr. Philly!

2936
03:04:36,800 --> 03:04:39,800
Is that the best explanation you can think of?

2937
03:04:39,800 --> 03:04:43,280
No one calls Little Maya Thief and gets away with it.

2938
03:04:43,280 --> 03:04:46,240
Is it really true that this is your necklace, Nork Maiden?

2939
03:04:46,240 --> 03:04:49,480
Of course, Inspector. It was a present. I swear it.

2940
03:04:49,480 --> 03:04:50,760
Who gave it to you?

2941
03:04:50,760 --> 03:04:53,120
That's a secret between me and Moomin.

2942
03:04:53,120 --> 03:04:54,520
A secret?

2943
03:04:54,520 --> 03:04:57,280
That's a lie. They stole it, Inspector.

2944
03:04:57,280 --> 03:04:59,880
I've never known them to lie before, Mrs. Philly John.

2945
03:04:59,880 --> 03:05:01,560
They're from a very bad background.

2946
03:05:01,560 --> 03:05:02,800
You should see their home.

2947
03:05:02,800 --> 03:05:03,840
Zora!

2948
03:05:03,840 --> 03:05:05,680
I'm going to get fucked up.

2949
03:05:05,680 --> 03:05:07,400
Stop the little man.

2950
03:05:07,400 --> 03:05:09,360
Bad background and you got ten things.

2951
03:05:09,360 --> 03:05:10,360
You say that.

2952
03:05:10,360 --> 03:05:11,840
No, there's something I want to ask you.

2953
03:05:11,840 --> 03:05:12,840
Little Maya.

2954
03:05:12,840 --> 03:05:13,840
What are you doing?

2955
03:05:13,840 --> 03:05:14,840
No!

2956
03:05:14,840 --> 03:05:16,840
Little Maya has to be a pain, you know.

2957
03:05:25,480 --> 03:05:26,480
This is it.

2958
03:05:32,680 --> 03:05:34,480
I love to know who did this.

2959
03:05:34,480 --> 03:05:36,680
He's sitting there going to knock with words.

2960
03:05:36,680 --> 03:05:37,680
What?

2961
03:05:37,680 --> 03:05:38,680
Huh?

2962
03:05:38,680 --> 03:05:41,440
Listen to this. This is a good example.

2963
03:05:41,440 --> 03:05:45,640
Hey, look at the sky. The sun's up and there's Gracie.

2964
03:05:45,640 --> 03:05:48,600
That's not great. Sounds very ordinary.

2965
03:05:48,600 --> 03:05:50,520
That's what I wrote, Snuffkin.

2966
03:05:50,520 --> 03:05:52,520
Oh, I'm so sorry.

2967
03:05:52,520 --> 03:05:53,600
That's all right.

2968
03:05:53,600 --> 03:05:56,000
Now, listen to how he rewrote it.

2969
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:59,880
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks.

2970
03:05:59,880 --> 03:06:02,320
It is the East, and Juliet is the sun.

2971
03:06:02,320 --> 03:06:04,400
Arise, Verson.

2972
03:06:04,400 --> 03:06:07,640
And kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale

2973
03:06:07,640 --> 03:06:09,440
with grief.

2974
03:06:09,440 --> 03:06:11,120
What a sunrise.

2975
03:06:11,120 --> 03:06:13,240
And note how clever this writer is to change

2976
03:06:13,240 --> 03:06:16,400
her name from Gracie to Juliet.

2977
03:06:16,400 --> 03:06:18,440
Gracie's worried because her parents don't approve

2978
03:06:18,440 --> 03:06:20,000
of her love, Edgar.

2979
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:22,040
I had it as names don't matter.

2980
03:06:22,040 --> 03:06:24,440
Tulip, I'd rangers, who cares?

2981
03:06:24,440 --> 03:06:25,840
But listen to this.

2982
03:06:25,840 --> 03:06:27,080
What's in a name?

2983
03:06:27,080 --> 03:06:29,560
That which we call a rose by any other name

2984
03:06:29,560 --> 03:06:33,600
would smell as sweet, much more romantic.

2985
03:06:33,600 --> 03:06:34,600
I got a show.

2986
03:06:34,600 --> 03:06:35,600
Oh, you wouldn't.

2987
03:06:35,600 --> 03:06:37,320
Or he'd not a Romeo called.

2988
03:06:37,320 --> 03:06:38,760
Oh, it's simply great.

2989
03:06:38,760 --> 03:06:41,240
Except maybe I wouldn't have mentioned his smell.

2990
03:06:41,240 --> 03:06:45,080
Don't you agree, he's an excellent playwright.

2991
03:06:45,080 --> 03:06:46,040
Yes, I agree.

2992
03:06:46,040 --> 03:06:48,440
He sounds like a very promising playwright.

2993
03:06:48,440 --> 03:06:50,880
And then wordy, perhaps, but really good.

2994
03:06:50,880 --> 03:06:52,760
Very good indeed.

2995
03:06:52,760 --> 03:06:55,520
Write him a note asking him to carry on.

2996
03:06:55,520 --> 03:06:57,080
And there might not be necessary.

2997
03:06:57,080 --> 03:06:59,560
You know, all the changes were made in the middle of the night

2998
03:06:59,560 --> 03:07:01,880
while I was fast asleep, and usually

2999
03:07:01,880 --> 03:07:04,120
writers are in their beds, none of their desks

3000
03:07:04,120 --> 03:07:06,960
when they're asleep.

3001
03:07:06,960 --> 03:07:10,440
Well, yes, that's the only time you're not at your desk, isn't it?

3002
03:07:10,440 --> 03:07:13,400
But there are people you know who walk about at night

3003
03:07:13,400 --> 03:07:16,000
without remembering about it the next morning.

3004
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:17,680
Sleepwalk, as you mean.

3005
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:19,160
Now I come to think of it.

3006
03:07:19,160 --> 03:07:21,680
You were rather sleepy when you woke up this morning.

3007
03:07:21,680 --> 03:07:25,200
You're right, Mum and Mama, even sleepier than usual.

3008
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:26,440
Just so.

3009
03:07:26,440 --> 03:07:28,640
You mean you yourself got up at night

3010
03:07:28,640 --> 03:07:31,640
and then went and rewrote the play in your sleep?

3011
03:07:31,640 --> 03:07:35,600
Well, yes, I have been worried about some minor things

3012
03:07:35,600 --> 03:07:37,000
in my play.

3013
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:40,800
So my subconsciousness, fairly rich and literary talent,

3014
03:07:40,800 --> 03:07:43,000
as we all know, comes to the rescue.

3015
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:44,120
A moment, Papa.

3016
03:07:44,120 --> 03:07:47,720
And in my sleep, my imagination runs riot.

3017
03:07:47,720 --> 03:07:49,880
I have all sorts of good ideas that make me

3018
03:07:49,880 --> 03:07:51,720
grab a pen in the middle of the night

3019
03:07:51,720 --> 03:07:57,600
and rush to my room to let the real skill throw.

3020
03:07:57,600 --> 03:07:58,960
Got it.

3021
03:07:58,960 --> 03:07:59,800
I got it.

3022
03:07:59,800 --> 03:08:00,760
I got it.

3023
03:08:00,760 --> 03:08:02,680
With this, I can have anything.

3024
03:08:02,680 --> 03:08:04,240
I can do anything.

3025
03:08:04,240 --> 03:08:05,240
Stop.

3026
03:08:05,240 --> 03:08:06,240
Stop.

3027
03:08:06,240 --> 03:08:08,680
When I say stop, you have to stop.

3028
03:08:08,680 --> 03:08:10,720
He's not expecting me.

3029
03:08:10,720 --> 03:08:14,720
I can be a fan of him, so you already.

3030
03:08:14,720 --> 03:08:16,880
We've arrived when you weren't getting last.

3031
03:08:16,880 --> 03:08:18,040
Get lost yourself.

3032
03:08:18,040 --> 03:08:19,560
I don't have time for you.

3033
03:08:19,560 --> 03:08:21,440
The inspector's chasing me.

3034
03:08:21,440 --> 03:08:22,480
What, you?

3035
03:08:22,480 --> 03:08:23,520
Stop, little boy.

3036
03:08:23,520 --> 03:08:24,440
I'm the inspector.

3037
03:08:24,440 --> 03:08:26,080
You have to stop when I say so.

3038
03:08:26,080 --> 03:08:27,840
He's not chasing me, Mum.

3039
03:08:27,840 --> 03:08:28,800
Don't deny it.

3040
03:08:28,800 --> 03:08:29,880
I know why you're running.

3041
03:08:29,880 --> 03:08:31,440
You stole that thing, didn't you?

3042
03:08:31,440 --> 03:08:33,440
I know it's true.

3043
03:08:33,440 --> 03:08:35,080
That's from the pure business.

3044
03:08:35,080 --> 03:08:36,400
It's not yours.

3045
03:08:36,400 --> 03:08:39,280
But it must be somebody, so I'll make it my business.

3046
03:08:39,280 --> 03:08:40,960
Get it to me.

3047
03:08:40,960 --> 03:08:42,520
Or is that me?

3048
03:08:42,520 --> 03:08:46,880
Please stop me, I'm going to give it back to me.

3049
03:08:46,880 --> 03:08:51,160
Hey, that looks like the lamp we've found.

3050
03:08:51,160 --> 03:08:53,400
Chase him, it's better not be.

3051
03:08:53,400 --> 03:08:54,880
Oh, no.

3052
03:08:54,880 --> 03:08:58,920
Well, man, Stinky's got our magic lamp right after him.

3053
03:08:58,920 --> 03:08:59,920
Yes.

3054
03:08:59,920 --> 03:09:01,040
We can't let him get away with it.

3055
03:09:01,040 --> 03:09:03,240
Our terrible things might happen.

3056
03:09:03,240 --> 03:09:05,280
Did you hear that, Stinky?

3057
03:09:05,280 --> 03:09:07,840
He said magic lamp or something.

3058
03:09:07,840 --> 03:09:09,400
After him.

3059
03:09:09,400 --> 03:09:10,840
The magic lamp is mine.

3060
03:09:10,840 --> 03:09:12,360
Just leave me alone.

3061
03:09:12,360 --> 03:09:13,960
Well, you guys, Stinky.

3062
03:09:13,960 --> 03:09:15,880
Help me get the necklace.

3063
03:09:15,880 --> 03:09:16,760
No, no, no, no.

3064
03:09:16,760 --> 03:09:18,320
This one is taking me.

3065
03:09:18,320 --> 03:09:19,400
Oh, no.

3066
03:09:19,400 --> 03:09:20,400
Oh, no.

3067
03:09:20,400 --> 03:09:21,400
Get a stick.

3068
03:09:21,400 --> 03:09:22,400
Get a stick.

3069
03:09:22,400 --> 03:09:23,400
Oh, no.

3070
03:09:23,400 --> 03:09:24,400
Get a stick.

3071
03:09:24,400 --> 03:09:25,400
Get a stick.

3072
03:09:25,400 --> 03:09:26,400
Get a stick.

3073
03:09:26,400 --> 03:09:27,400
Get a stick.

3074
03:09:27,400 --> 03:09:28,400
Get a stick.

3075
03:09:28,400 --> 03:09:29,400
Oh, my dear.

3076
03:09:29,400 --> 03:09:30,400
He's coming.

3077
03:09:30,400 --> 03:09:31,400
He's coming.

3078
03:09:31,400 --> 03:09:32,400
No.

3079
03:09:32,400 --> 03:09:33,400
Oh.

3080
03:09:33,400 --> 03:09:41,640
You're the spirit of the lamp, aren't you?

3081
03:09:41,640 --> 03:09:42,640
Yes, my master.

3082
03:09:42,640 --> 03:09:43,640
What is your wish?

3083
03:09:43,640 --> 03:09:44,640
You his master?

3084
03:09:44,640 --> 03:09:45,640
Yes, me.

3085
03:09:45,640 --> 03:09:47,640
I'm the master.

3086
03:09:47,640 --> 03:09:50,800
I let him out, so he'll do what I say.

3087
03:09:50,800 --> 03:09:54,840
I don't believe a word of this fairy tale's untrue.

3088
03:09:54,840 --> 03:09:57,200
Maybe it isn't true, but it works.

3089
03:09:57,200 --> 03:10:01,440
I saw a snork maiden wishing for a pearl necklace, and her wish was granted.

3090
03:10:01,440 --> 03:10:04,440
Uh-huh, so you're responsible.

3091
03:10:04,440 --> 03:10:06,640
Yeah, and I brought it right away.

3092
03:10:06,640 --> 03:10:09,280
God, now let me see.

3093
03:10:09,280 --> 03:10:11,800
What do I want more than anything in the world?

3094
03:10:11,800 --> 03:10:15,080
Stinky, he can only make one wish a week come true.

3095
03:10:15,080 --> 03:10:16,680
You'll have to wait your turn.

3096
03:10:16,680 --> 03:10:19,760
No, that's very unfair.

3097
03:10:19,760 --> 03:10:21,360
Let's get back to the necklace.

3098
03:10:21,360 --> 03:10:22,960
Where did you steal it from, mister?

3099
03:10:22,960 --> 03:10:23,960
I don't steal.

3100
03:10:23,960 --> 03:10:26,680
Well, then tell me where you found it.

3101
03:10:26,680 --> 03:10:28,280
Around here somewhere.

3102
03:10:28,280 --> 03:10:30,360
Mrs. Philly, John's house, baby.

3103
03:10:30,360 --> 03:10:31,760
I don't know who lives there.

3104
03:10:31,760 --> 03:10:34,040
Oh, then you did steal the necklace.

3105
03:10:34,040 --> 03:10:37,160
Well, that's a lot easier, you know.

3106
03:10:37,160 --> 03:10:41,400
How about a magic key that can open anything, Boltson safes and stuff, huh?

3107
03:10:41,400 --> 03:10:44,120
Listen, there's something I'd like to ask you.

3108
03:10:44,120 --> 03:10:48,040
A sack of gold wouldn't be half as much fun as a key that opens anything.

3109
03:10:48,040 --> 03:10:51,920
Tell me, is it possible that you rewrote woman poppers play?

3110
03:10:51,920 --> 03:10:52,920
Yes, I did.

3111
03:10:52,920 --> 03:10:54,240
It was really awful.

3112
03:10:54,240 --> 03:10:56,920
Oh, come on, now I just needed some polishing.

3113
03:10:56,920 --> 03:11:00,480
And what's more, see this young man standing here?

3114
03:11:00,480 --> 03:11:03,400
Well, he was really worried about your play, you know.

3115
03:11:03,400 --> 03:11:04,920
I was just trying to help.

3116
03:11:04,920 --> 03:11:05,920
Is this true?

3117
03:11:05,920 --> 03:11:09,280
Yeah, safer than mercury, of course.

3118
03:11:09,280 --> 03:11:12,400
But then there's professional pride to think of.

3119
03:11:12,400 --> 03:11:13,680
I can explain, Papa.

3120
03:11:13,680 --> 03:11:15,720
I saw you weren't happy about your play,

3121
03:11:15,720 --> 03:11:19,160
and I wanted it to be a big success.

3122
03:11:19,160 --> 03:11:21,880
Of course, I didn't want the spirit to write it himself.

3123
03:11:21,880 --> 03:11:23,800
I'm going to take the key, yeah.

3124
03:11:23,800 --> 03:11:27,880
I've just realized, everybody, the spirit didn't write all that himself.

3125
03:11:27,880 --> 03:11:29,080
I've heard it before.

3126
03:11:29,080 --> 03:11:30,880
I thought it sounded familiar.

3127
03:11:30,880 --> 03:11:32,680
Really, is that so?

3128
03:11:32,680 --> 03:11:36,160
Yes, he stole it from a play by somebody else.

3129
03:11:36,160 --> 03:11:38,960
This spirit is a cheat and a liar.

3130
03:11:38,960 --> 03:11:41,200
Oh, dear me.

3131
03:11:41,200 --> 03:11:43,200
Well, I can't help being so well read.

3132
03:11:43,200 --> 03:11:44,640
Can I go back in the lamp now?

3133
03:11:44,640 --> 03:11:46,760
No, wait, don't run, yes, don't.

3134
03:11:46,760 --> 03:11:48,600
I want to explain this now.

3135
03:11:48,600 --> 03:11:50,320
Sorry, Master, can't oblige.

3136
03:11:50,320 --> 03:11:52,880
Have them put into an impossible situation.

3137
03:11:52,880 --> 03:11:53,880
See you next week.

3138
03:11:58,160 --> 03:12:00,000
But that's ridiculous.

3139
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:03,320
Not next week, nor next month, nor even next year.

3140
03:12:03,320 --> 03:12:05,680
Stinky, this lamp is not yours.

3141
03:12:05,680 --> 03:12:08,600
Besides, I know exactly the sort of thing you'd ask for.

3142
03:12:08,600 --> 03:12:11,960
A master key or something.

3143
03:12:11,960 --> 03:12:14,880
You think you can hide that magic lamp from me, do you?

3144
03:12:14,880 --> 03:12:19,880
Well, there's no hiding place good enough for that.

3145
03:12:19,880 --> 03:12:21,920
Well, then, I really do think that lamp

3146
03:12:21,920 --> 03:12:25,000
is a bit too dangerous to have a rod.

3147
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:26,800
I think you're right.

3148
03:12:26,800 --> 03:12:29,600
Snuffkin, do you have any good ideas for us?

3149
03:12:43,080 --> 03:12:45,520
We can pass, so we can summon the spirit again.

3150
03:12:49,880 --> 03:12:55,880
There's the inspector.

3151
03:13:01,880 --> 03:13:03,880
You do it, Snuffkin.

3152
03:13:03,880 --> 03:13:04,880
Call the spirit.

3153
03:13:13,880 --> 03:13:14,880
Oh, no, not again.

3154
03:13:14,880 --> 03:13:16,880
What do you want this time?

3155
03:13:16,880 --> 03:13:18,880
Can you bring the hobgoblin here?

3156
03:13:19,880 --> 03:13:20,880
I suppose so.

3157
03:13:20,880 --> 03:13:22,880
I'll be back as soon as I can.

3158
03:13:29,880 --> 03:13:32,880
But why on earth do you want the hobgoblin?

3159
03:13:32,880 --> 03:13:36,880
As far as I can see, there's only one safe place for the lamp

3160
03:13:36,880 --> 03:13:38,880
where no one can find it.

3161
03:13:38,880 --> 03:13:41,880
And that's on another planet, and the only one who can put it there

3162
03:13:41,880 --> 03:13:43,880
is the hobgoblin.

3163
03:13:43,880 --> 03:13:44,880
He's coming any minute.

3164
03:13:44,880 --> 03:13:47,880
Geez, that guy ever hard to find.

3165
03:13:47,880 --> 03:13:48,880
Thank you.

3166
03:13:48,880 --> 03:13:50,880
I've done my wake for this week.

3167
03:13:50,880 --> 03:13:51,880
See you next week.

3168
03:13:51,880 --> 03:13:52,880
Goodbye!

3169
03:14:10,880 --> 03:14:13,880
And some of the hobgoblin took the magic ram away

3170
03:14:13,880 --> 03:14:16,880
and hid it on some unknown planet.

3171
03:14:16,880 --> 03:14:20,880
And a good thing too, it would really be very boring

3172
03:14:20,880 --> 03:14:23,880
if all your wishes were granted, wouldn't it?

3173
03:14:46,880 --> 03:14:51,880
The day after day, the moon is.

3174
03:14:51,880 --> 03:14:55,880
The moon is.

3175
03:14:55,880 --> 03:15:00,880
The moon is.

3176
03:15:16,880 --> 03:15:26,880
Here they are for one and all.

3177
03:15:26,880 --> 03:15:29,880
The movements are about to come.

3178
03:15:29,880 --> 03:15:32,880
Come on and sit down here with me.

3179
03:15:32,880 --> 03:15:34,880
They're for you on your TV.

3180
03:15:34,880 --> 03:15:37,880
They are the movements.

3181
03:15:37,880 --> 03:15:40,880
They are the movements.

3182
03:15:40,880 --> 03:15:43,880
So come with me, give me your hand.

3183
03:15:43,880 --> 03:15:46,880
I'll take you up to a moment land.

3184
03:15:46,880 --> 03:15:49,880
You can fly just like a bird.

3185
03:15:49,880 --> 03:15:52,880
Sing that song ever.

3186
03:15:52,880 --> 03:15:54,880
There were the movements.

3187
03:15:54,880 --> 03:15:57,880
There were the movements.

3188
03:15:57,880 --> 03:16:00,880
There were the movements.

3189
03:16:00,880 --> 03:16:03,880
There were the movements.

3190
03:16:03,880 --> 03:16:06,880
There were the movements.

3191
03:16:06,880 --> 03:16:09,880
There were the movements.

3192
03:16:13,880 --> 03:16:16,880
There were the movements.

3193
03:16:16,880 --> 03:16:19,880
There were the movements.

3194
03:16:19,880 --> 03:16:22,880
There were the movements.

3195
03:16:22,880 --> 03:16:25,880
There were the movements.

3196
03:16:33,880 --> 03:16:36,880
Winter was just around the corner.

3197
03:16:36,880 --> 03:16:42,880
And that was the time of year for movement to get restless.

3198
03:16:42,880 --> 03:16:49,880
Snuffkin, why?

3199
03:16:49,880 --> 03:16:56,880
Because this was the time of year for snuffkin to leave movement valley on his yearly trek south.

3200
03:16:56,880 --> 03:17:06,880
Good morning, Papa.

3201
03:17:06,880 --> 03:17:14,880
That bonfire looks inviting.

3202
03:17:14,880 --> 03:17:16,880
You're up already.

3203
03:17:16,880 --> 03:17:21,880
We're buried in leaves this morning after that wind last night.

3204
03:17:21,880 --> 03:17:23,880
Yes, winders on the way.

3205
03:17:23,880 --> 03:17:26,880
Oh, this is a lovely bonfire.

3206
03:17:26,880 --> 03:17:29,880
Yes, isn't it?

3207
03:17:29,880 --> 03:17:31,880
I guess we're hibernating again this winter.

3208
03:17:31,880 --> 03:17:33,880
Are we moving, Papa?

3209
03:17:33,880 --> 03:17:35,880
Well, of course.

3210
03:17:35,880 --> 03:17:37,880
We always hibernate in the winter.

3211
03:17:37,880 --> 03:17:39,880
If snuffkin says I could go with him,

3212
03:17:39,880 --> 03:17:43,880
couldn't I give this winter a miss and hibernate longer next year?

3213
03:17:43,880 --> 03:17:44,880
More.

3214
03:17:44,880 --> 03:17:46,880
Oh, please, moving, Papa.

3215
03:17:46,880 --> 03:17:49,880
Snuffkin would rather go alone, I think, movement.

3216
03:17:50,880 --> 03:17:53,880
But I might get him to train his mind.

3217
03:17:53,880 --> 03:17:56,880
That snuffkin's not really a person who likes to be pressed.

3218
03:17:56,880 --> 03:17:58,880
Why not?

3219
03:17:58,880 --> 03:18:01,880
Well, he's a very solitary person.

3220
03:18:01,880 --> 03:18:05,880
His winter trip is the only time he can really be alone for a while.

3221
03:18:05,880 --> 03:18:07,880
I know, but I was just hoping.

3222
03:18:07,880 --> 03:18:11,880
Snuffkin likes you very much, I know that.

3223
03:18:11,880 --> 03:18:15,880
And I think that's why he stays in movement valley for the rest of the year.

3224
03:18:15,880 --> 03:18:20,880
But at heart, he's a vagabond and he needs time away from us.

3225
03:18:20,880 --> 03:18:23,880
He's not a family man, so he's free to do as he wants.

3226
03:18:23,880 --> 03:18:26,880
And as his friend, you should try to understand.

3227
03:18:26,880 --> 03:18:30,880
I know you'd like to go with him, but I don't think he's such a good idea.

3228
03:18:30,880 --> 03:18:33,880
He'd really hate to turn you down, I know.

3229
03:18:33,880 --> 03:18:35,880
I guess.

3230
03:18:35,880 --> 03:18:37,880
But he'd have to.

3231
03:18:40,880 --> 03:18:42,880
Oh.

3232
03:18:46,880 --> 03:18:48,880
Oh.

3233
03:18:51,880 --> 03:18:55,880
Why aren't they biting?

3234
03:18:55,880 --> 03:18:58,880
I haven't had a proper catch for days.

3235
03:18:58,880 --> 03:19:00,880
Getting too cold, is that?

3236
03:19:03,880 --> 03:19:05,880
When are you leaving?

3237
03:19:05,880 --> 03:19:07,880
You're about to leave, aren't you?

3238
03:19:07,880 --> 03:19:10,880
Yes.

3239
03:19:11,880 --> 03:19:15,880
Could I ask you something?

3240
03:19:15,880 --> 03:19:17,880
What?

3241
03:19:17,880 --> 03:19:19,880
Don't go without telling me.

3242
03:19:19,880 --> 03:19:21,880
But why?

3243
03:19:21,880 --> 03:19:25,880
I'm always sad when you leave, even though I know you'll return in the spring.

3244
03:19:25,880 --> 03:19:28,880
Yeah. Me too, sort of.

3245
03:19:28,880 --> 03:19:31,880
That's why this year I'd plan to leave without saying anything.

3246
03:19:31,880 --> 03:19:35,880
But it makes me even sadder if I can't see goodbye properly.

3247
03:19:35,880 --> 03:19:37,880
I'd like to wish you good luck and all that.

3248
03:19:37,880 --> 03:19:39,880
I miss you so much when you're away.

3249
03:19:39,880 --> 03:19:42,880
Please, Nuffkin.

3250
03:19:42,880 --> 03:19:44,880
Moomin, I have a better idea.

3251
03:19:44,880 --> 03:19:46,880
I won't leave until after you've started hibernating.

3252
03:19:46,880 --> 03:19:48,880
Then you won't miss me, will you?

3253
03:19:48,880 --> 03:19:49,880
You're right.

3254
03:19:49,880 --> 03:19:51,880
I'll take me right out here, Snuffkin.

3255
03:19:51,880 --> 03:19:53,880
Then we won't really part at all, won't we?

3256
03:19:53,880 --> 03:19:54,880
Nope.

3257
03:19:54,880 --> 03:19:58,880
Because I promised to be back here in Moomin Valley before you've even woken up.

3258
03:19:58,880 --> 03:20:01,880
Wonderful! What a super idea!

3259
03:20:01,880 --> 03:20:06,880
Hey, Moomin!

3260
03:20:06,880 --> 03:20:08,880
Oh, Snuff.

3261
03:20:08,880 --> 03:20:10,880
Moomin, come here a minute.

3262
03:20:10,880 --> 03:20:12,880
There's something funny caught up in a tree.

3263
03:20:12,880 --> 03:20:14,880
What do you mean, funny?

3264
03:20:14,880 --> 03:20:17,880
I don't know exactly never saw anything like it before.

3265
03:20:17,880 --> 03:20:21,880
Snork made a little myfounded first, but it's too high to get it down.

3266
03:20:21,880 --> 03:20:23,880
Okay, I'll come have a look.

3267
03:20:28,880 --> 03:20:30,880
Be careful.

3268
03:20:32,880 --> 03:20:36,880
Be careful. What is it, Moomin?

3269
03:20:39,880 --> 03:20:42,880
I know what it is. It's a kite.

3270
03:20:42,880 --> 03:20:43,880
Oh, what?

3271
03:20:43,880 --> 03:20:45,880
A kite is something you find in the sky.

3272
03:20:45,880 --> 03:20:47,880
But it has no wings.

3273
03:20:47,880 --> 03:20:50,880
No, you send it up against the wind on a string.

3274
03:20:51,880 --> 03:20:52,880
Bye!

3275
03:21:15,880 --> 03:21:17,880
Be careful.

3276
03:21:17,880 --> 03:21:24,880
Where'd it go?

3277
03:21:24,880 --> 03:21:26,880
Oh, through it though.

3278
03:21:26,880 --> 03:21:34,880
That's all right!

3279
03:21:34,880 --> 03:21:37,880
Oh, song!

3280
03:21:37,880 --> 03:21:40,880
This is what a kite looks like.

3281
03:21:40,880 --> 03:21:42,880
Looks broken to me.

3282
03:21:42,880 --> 03:21:45,880
I'm sure we can fix it and make it fly.

3283
03:21:45,880 --> 03:21:46,880
Let's see.

3284
03:21:46,880 --> 03:21:47,880
Oh, no.

3285
03:21:47,880 --> 03:21:52,880
The string must have broken when someone was flying it and the wind blew it down into the tree.

3286
03:21:52,880 --> 03:21:54,880
Well, why don't we repair it?

3287
03:21:54,880 --> 03:21:55,880
Yes, let's.

3288
03:21:55,880 --> 03:21:57,880
Looks pretty badly broken to me.

3289
03:21:57,880 --> 03:21:58,880
Well, I don't know.

3290
03:21:58,880 --> 03:22:03,880
We'll have to see.

3291
03:22:03,880 --> 03:22:05,880
It is a kite, isn't it?

3292
03:22:05,880 --> 03:22:07,880
Can we mend it?

3293
03:22:07,880 --> 03:22:12,880
Maybe.

3294
03:22:12,880 --> 03:22:14,880
A very odd kite.

3295
03:22:14,880 --> 03:22:16,880
It must have come from far away.

3296
03:22:16,880 --> 03:22:18,880
You think it can be repaired?

3297
03:22:18,880 --> 03:22:19,880
Of course.

3298
03:22:19,880 --> 03:22:20,880
Well, come on then.

3299
03:22:20,880 --> 03:22:22,880
Snork will help you repair it.

3300
03:22:22,880 --> 03:22:24,880
I can repair it without your help.

3301
03:22:24,880 --> 03:22:27,880
As long as you can find us some really long string.

3302
03:22:27,880 --> 03:22:30,880
Strong but not too thick if possible.

3303
03:22:30,880 --> 03:22:32,880
I think I have what you need.

3304
03:22:32,880 --> 03:22:33,880
Some string.

3305
03:22:33,880 --> 03:22:34,880
Good.

3306
03:22:34,880 --> 03:22:35,880
Excellent.

3307
03:22:35,880 --> 03:22:37,880
I'll start immediately.

3308
03:22:42,880 --> 03:22:43,880
Good.

3309
03:22:43,880 --> 03:22:44,880
Good.

3310
03:22:44,880 --> 03:22:45,880
Good.

3311
03:22:45,880 --> 03:22:46,880
Good.

3312
03:22:46,880 --> 03:22:47,880
Good.

3313
03:22:47,880 --> 03:22:48,880
Good.

3314
03:22:48,880 --> 03:22:49,880
Good.

3315
03:22:49,880 --> 03:22:50,880
Good.

3316
03:22:50,880 --> 03:22:51,880
Good.

3317
03:22:51,880 --> 03:22:52,880
Good.

3318
03:22:52,880 --> 03:22:53,880
Good.

3319
03:22:53,880 --> 03:22:54,880
Good.

3320
03:22:54,880 --> 03:22:55,880
Good.

3321
03:22:55,880 --> 03:22:56,880
Good.

3322
03:22:56,880 --> 03:22:57,880
Good.

3323
03:22:57,880 --> 03:22:58,880
Good.

3324
03:22:58,880 --> 03:22:59,880
Good.

3325
03:22:59,880 --> 03:23:00,880
Good.

3326
03:23:00,880 --> 03:23:01,880
Good.

3327
03:23:01,880 --> 03:23:02,880
Good.

3328
03:23:02,880 --> 03:23:03,880
Good.

3329
03:23:03,880 --> 03:23:04,880
Good.

3330
03:23:04,880 --> 03:23:05,880
Good.

3331
03:23:05,880 --> 03:23:06,880
Good.

3332
03:23:06,880 --> 03:23:07,880
Good.

3333
03:23:07,880 --> 03:23:08,880
Good.

3334
03:23:08,880 --> 03:23:10,880
Good.

3335
03:23:10,880 --> 03:23:11,880
Good.

3336
03:23:11,880 --> 03:23:12,880
Good.

3337
03:23:12,880 --> 03:23:13,880
Good.

3338
03:23:13,880 --> 03:23:14,880
Good.

3339
03:23:14,880 --> 03:23:15,880
Good.

3340
03:23:15,880 --> 03:23:16,880
Good.

3341
03:23:16,880 --> 03:23:17,880
Good.

3342
03:23:17,880 --> 03:23:18,880
Good.

3343
03:23:18,880 --> 03:23:19,880
Good.

3344
03:23:19,880 --> 03:23:20,880
Good.

3345
03:23:20,880 --> 03:23:21,880
Good.

3346
03:23:21,880 --> 03:23:22,880
Good.

3347
03:23:22,880 --> 03:23:23,880
Good.

3348
03:23:23,880 --> 03:23:24,880
Good.

3349
03:23:24,880 --> 03:23:25,880
Good.

3350
03:23:25,880 --> 03:23:26,880
Good.

3351
03:23:26,880 --> 03:23:27,880
Good.

3352
03:23:27,880 --> 03:23:28,880
Good.

3353
03:23:28,880 --> 03:23:29,880
Good.

3354
03:23:29,880 --> 03:23:30,880
Good.

3355
03:23:30,880 --> 03:23:31,880
Good.

3356
03:23:31,880 --> 03:23:32,880
Good.

3357
03:23:32,880 --> 03:23:33,880
Good.

3358
03:23:33,880 --> 03:23:34,880
Good.

3359
03:23:34,880 --> 03:23:35,880
Good.

3360
03:23:35,880 --> 03:23:36,880
Hey.

3361
03:23:36,880 --> 03:23:38,880
Thanks for watching.

3362
03:23:38,880 --> 03:23:43,880
This is a really exciting project I haven't flown a kite for years.

3363
03:23:43,880 --> 03:23:46,880
I do hope that string is long enough.

3364
03:23:46,880 --> 03:23:48,880
Snorke, is this okay?

3365
03:23:48,880 --> 03:23:50,880
Fine, who's gonna fly it?

3366
03:23:50,880 --> 03:23:52,880
I'll do it.

3367
03:23:52,880 --> 03:23:53,880
Okay, Sniff.

3368
03:23:53,880 --> 03:23:56,880
Moving, hold the kite up high.

3369
03:23:56,880 --> 03:23:57,880
Like this?

3370
03:23:57,880 --> 03:24:00,880
Hmm. All right, Sniff, are you ready?

3371
03:24:00,880 --> 03:24:04,880
Yeah, I'm ready. Don't let go until I say win.

3372
03:24:08,880 --> 03:24:10,880
Win, moment!

3373
03:24:12,880 --> 03:24:14,880
Ho!

3374
03:24:16,880 --> 03:24:18,880
Uh-oh, it's falling.

3375
03:24:18,880 --> 03:24:24,880
Try again, and this time start running and when the win catches the kite, you start paying out the lie.

3376
03:24:24,880 --> 03:24:27,880
All right, fine. Hold it up again, moment.

3377
03:24:27,880 --> 03:24:29,880
Right.

3378
03:24:29,880 --> 03:24:30,880
Ready?

3379
03:24:30,880 --> 03:24:33,880
Yeah, I'm ready. Let go of it!

3380
03:24:33,880 --> 03:24:36,880
Easy going up, kid!

3381
03:24:38,880 --> 03:24:43,880
No, it isn't! Stop, Sniff! You're breaking the kite!

3382
03:24:43,880 --> 03:24:47,880
I don't think this kite's any good for anybody!

3383
03:24:47,880 --> 03:24:51,880
The kite's fine. It's just that the wind is too weak.

3384
03:24:51,880 --> 03:24:54,880
All right, we'll have to wait for it to get stronger.

3385
03:24:54,880 --> 03:24:58,880
Pretty though, we certainly had a good strong wind yesterday.

3386
03:24:58,880 --> 03:25:00,880
Is it okay?

3387
03:25:00,880 --> 03:25:03,880
I think the wind is getting stronger, moment.

3388
03:25:08,880 --> 03:25:10,880
Oh!

3389
03:25:20,880 --> 03:25:22,880
There it goes!

3390
03:25:28,880 --> 03:25:30,880
Let me hold the string, moment.

3391
03:25:33,880 --> 03:25:36,880
Boy, this wind is really strong! Can I let out the string now?

3392
03:25:36,880 --> 03:25:38,880
Do it slowly, mind!

3393
03:25:38,880 --> 03:25:40,880
All right!

3394
03:25:43,880 --> 03:25:46,880
Let me do it, Sniff! Come on, it's my turn!

3395
03:25:46,880 --> 03:25:48,880
I'm afraid you can't, little lie.

3396
03:25:48,880 --> 03:25:51,880
Why not? Because you don't win, up to all it!

3397
03:25:51,880 --> 03:25:53,880
I'm very strong!

3398
03:25:53,880 --> 03:25:56,880
The wind is quite strong! You come up with it!

3399
03:25:57,880 --> 03:25:58,880
Yes, Papa?

3400
03:25:58,880 --> 03:26:00,880
It's difficult to hold it for a while.

3401
03:26:00,880 --> 03:26:02,880
Well, yes, you'd like it.

3402
03:26:02,880 --> 03:26:04,880
Hold it really tight, then.

3403
03:26:16,880 --> 03:26:20,880
All right, I could do this long before he was born.

3404
03:26:20,880 --> 03:26:22,880
Oops!

3405
03:26:23,880 --> 03:26:26,880
Oh, what's happening?

3406
03:26:28,880 --> 03:26:30,880
Papa, wipe it up quickly.

3407
03:26:30,880 --> 03:26:33,880
And I'm winding, I'm winding.

3408
03:26:33,880 --> 03:26:35,880
Faster, I'm winding faster!

3409
03:26:35,880 --> 03:26:37,880
What's going on?

3410
03:26:37,880 --> 03:26:39,880
What's going on?

3411
03:26:39,880 --> 03:26:41,880
What's going on?

3412
03:26:47,880 --> 03:26:49,880
That was definitely not my fault.

3413
03:26:49,880 --> 03:26:51,880
Of course it wasn't.

3414
03:26:51,880 --> 03:26:53,880
With such a strong wind up there,

3415
03:26:53,880 --> 03:26:56,880
I think we have to lower the centre of gravity a bit.

3416
03:26:59,880 --> 03:27:01,880
The kite's all right, Papa!

3417
03:27:01,880 --> 03:27:05,880
Hmm, maybe it would take me with it.

3418
03:27:19,880 --> 03:27:21,880
That's it!

3419
03:27:21,880 --> 03:27:24,880
I suppose that's to stop it from spinning around. Is it snorke?

3420
03:27:24,880 --> 03:27:26,880
Yes, that's right.

3421
03:27:33,880 --> 03:27:35,880
What is it?

3422
03:27:37,880 --> 03:27:39,880
Listen, I'm going to ride that kite.

3423
03:27:39,880 --> 03:27:41,880
What did you say?

3424
03:27:41,880 --> 03:27:44,880
I think it's going to be okay now.

3425
03:27:44,880 --> 03:27:46,880
If I hold on really tight,

3426
03:27:46,880 --> 03:27:48,880
I think I could have a wonderful ride on that kite.

3427
03:27:48,880 --> 03:27:51,880
Yes, maybe it'd be wonderful while you're up in the sky,

3428
03:27:51,880 --> 03:27:54,880
but you've seen how fast it can come down again.

3429
03:27:54,880 --> 03:27:57,880
But the snorke just said it won't fall down again.

3430
03:27:57,880 --> 03:27:58,880
Even so!

3431
03:27:58,880 --> 03:28:00,880
I'm going to do it, but no one must see me

3432
03:28:00,880 --> 03:28:03,880
or they might try to stop me if they guess what I'm up to.

3433
03:28:03,880 --> 03:28:05,880
Oh, please don't do it.

3434
03:28:05,880 --> 03:28:07,880
What are you doing?

3435
03:28:07,880 --> 03:28:09,880
Listen carefully.

3436
03:28:09,880 --> 03:28:11,880
Yes.

3437
03:28:11,880 --> 03:28:14,880
When we fly the kite next time,

3438
03:28:14,880 --> 03:28:17,880
what are you two whispering about?

3439
03:28:17,880 --> 03:28:19,880
We weren't snorke, Maiden.

3440
03:28:19,880 --> 03:28:22,880
I was just saying to Sniff that the kite wouldn't fall down again.

3441
03:28:22,880 --> 03:28:24,880
It won't! Snorke is fixed it.

3442
03:28:24,880 --> 03:28:26,880
But you can't be absolutely sure.

3443
03:28:26,880 --> 03:28:29,880
And you'll be holding the kite, won't you, Sniff?

3444
03:28:29,880 --> 03:28:30,880
Me?

3445
03:28:30,880 --> 03:28:32,880
Now then, do you want to do it, Moomin?

3446
03:28:32,880 --> 03:28:35,880
Yes, and this time I'll let out all the line.

3447
03:28:35,880 --> 03:28:38,880
And Sniff, you could hold it up, okay?

3448
03:28:38,880 --> 03:28:39,880
Yes, that's fine.

3449
03:28:39,880 --> 03:28:40,880
No!

3450
03:28:40,880 --> 03:28:42,880
I'm counting on you, Sniff.

3451
03:28:42,880 --> 03:28:44,880
And so am I, Sniff.

3452
03:28:44,880 --> 03:28:46,880
Hmm.

3453
03:28:54,880 --> 03:28:56,880
Are you sure you'll be all right?

3454
03:28:56,880 --> 03:28:58,880
Of course I will, silly.

3455
03:28:58,880 --> 03:29:00,880
Well, I'm not so sure.

3456
03:29:00,880 --> 03:29:02,880
Why don't you keep your eyes closed, then?

3457
03:29:02,880 --> 03:29:04,880
Good idea.

3458
03:29:04,880 --> 03:29:06,880
Okay, Sniff.

3459
03:29:06,880 --> 03:29:08,880
Let go of it when I say ready.

3460
03:29:08,880 --> 03:29:10,880
Bye.

3461
03:29:10,880 --> 03:29:12,880
Ready!

3462
03:29:12,880 --> 03:29:14,880
Go!

3463
03:29:14,880 --> 03:29:17,880
Yay!

3464
03:29:17,880 --> 03:29:20,880
Yay!

3465
03:29:20,880 --> 03:29:22,880
Yay!

3466
03:29:22,880 --> 03:29:25,880
Yay!

3467
03:29:25,880 --> 03:29:28,880
Yay!

3468
03:29:28,880 --> 03:29:31,880
Yay!

3469
03:29:31,880 --> 03:29:33,880
Yay, yay!

3470
03:29:33,880 --> 03:29:35,880
Yay!

3471
03:29:35,880 --> 03:29:38,880
Yay!

3472
03:29:38,880 --> 03:30:02,880
That's it. That's all of the line. It's very high. Must be some wind up there. It's flying really well, isn't it? Certainly is.

3473
03:30:02,880 --> 03:30:16,880
This is getting bumpy. What's that? Let's see if there's something very strange happening on that kite.

3474
03:30:16,880 --> 03:30:27,880
What is it? I can't see properly from here. I saw something. Could it be a bird maybe? The kite is turned again, but it wasn't a bird.

3475
03:30:27,880 --> 03:30:36,880
Or a twig or something, then. Did you see the back of the kite from where you are, Sniff? No, Mom and Mama, because my eyes are closed.

3476
03:30:36,880 --> 03:30:42,880
Oh, I think I know who it is. Little Mai. What?

3477
03:30:45,880 --> 03:30:52,880
No, I haven't seen one of my four. She seems to have disappeared. Don't ask me anything. I know nothing at all about it.

3478
03:30:52,880 --> 03:30:59,880
Sniff, what do you mean? Well, she was dead set on riding the kite. I couldn't stop her. What?

3479
03:30:59,880 --> 03:31:03,880
Moment, bring it down very slowly.

3480
03:31:03,880 --> 03:31:17,880
Take it easy, moving. That wind is strong. It could break the line.

3481
03:31:17,880 --> 03:31:28,880
But that was what a friend was best streamed. It's the knot I wore in the board knot. The one between our line and the bit that was still hanging from the kite when we found it.

3482
03:31:28,880 --> 03:31:35,880
The line is fine, if the knot is another one.

3483
03:31:55,880 --> 03:31:57,880
Hang on tight little Mai.

3484
03:31:57,880 --> 03:32:00,880
That wind is getting stronger.

3485
03:32:03,880 --> 03:32:06,880
Oh, this is more scarier than I thought.

3486
03:32:09,880 --> 03:32:12,880
I'll just have to hang on as best as I can.

3487
03:32:14,880 --> 03:32:17,880
Don't move around so much. I can't help it.

3488
03:32:18,880 --> 03:32:22,880
It's almost down. What?

3489
03:32:27,880 --> 03:32:28,880
Oh.

3490
03:32:35,880 --> 03:32:39,880
It's not open. Come on. Sniff, get up.

3491
03:32:39,880 --> 03:32:42,880
All right. Sniff, play yourself together.

3492
03:32:42,880 --> 03:32:44,880
Yes, all right.

3493
03:32:46,880 --> 03:32:49,880
She's being blown away towards lonely mountains.

3494
03:32:49,880 --> 03:32:51,880
Mama!

3495
03:32:51,880 --> 03:32:55,880
Oh, I do hope little Mai really is indestructible.

3496
03:33:03,880 --> 03:33:06,880
Where in the world is this kite taking me?

3497
03:33:08,880 --> 03:33:12,880
All lonely mountains, I'm a long way from home.

3498
03:33:14,880 --> 03:33:16,880
Little Mai! Little Mai!

3499
03:33:17,880 --> 03:33:19,880
Now she's going towards the forest of witches.

3500
03:33:19,880 --> 03:33:22,880
She'll be all right if she fell into a tree, wouldn't she?

3501
03:33:24,880 --> 03:33:26,880
I can't see her. There's no sign of her.

3502
03:33:26,880 --> 03:33:29,880
Well, I'm almost sure she was heading this way.

3503
03:33:32,880 --> 03:33:34,880
What is it, Sniff?

3504
03:33:34,880 --> 03:33:38,880
Imagine she might have fallen somewhere. She might be lying there waiting for help.

3505
03:33:38,880 --> 03:33:41,880
Oh, stop imagining things, Sniff.

3506
03:33:41,880 --> 03:33:43,880
She's still up there. I'm sure of it.

3507
03:33:44,880 --> 03:33:46,880
Huh?

3508
03:33:46,880 --> 03:33:47,880
What is it, Papa?

3509
03:33:47,880 --> 03:33:49,880
I saw something up there.

3510
03:33:49,880 --> 03:33:50,880
Little Mai?

3511
03:33:50,880 --> 03:33:52,880
No, Sniff.

3512
03:33:52,880 --> 03:33:56,880
No, it looked more like the Hobgoblin riding his panther through the sky.

3513
03:33:56,880 --> 03:33:57,880
Really?

3514
03:33:58,880 --> 03:34:00,880
Did you see that? Did you?

3515
03:34:00,880 --> 03:34:02,880
You found the Mai.

3516
03:34:04,880 --> 03:34:06,880
No, the Hobgoblin. Then it was him.

3517
03:34:06,880 --> 03:34:09,880
Forget the Hobgoblin. We're looking for little Mai.

3518
03:34:09,880 --> 03:34:12,880
And all you can think of is the Hobgoblin.

3519
03:34:14,880 --> 03:34:16,880
Oh, come on, let's go out here.

3520
03:34:25,880 --> 03:34:26,880
Oh, come on.

3521
03:34:26,880 --> 03:34:27,880
Oh, come on.

3522
03:34:32,880 --> 03:34:34,880
Oh, come on.

3523
03:34:34,880 --> 03:34:36,880
Oh, come on.

3524
03:34:36,880 --> 03:34:38,880
Oh, come on.

3525
03:34:38,880 --> 03:34:40,880
Oh, no!

3526
03:34:40,880 --> 03:34:43,880
Stop it, you're screaming!

3527
03:34:43,880 --> 03:34:45,880
Let the white hair stop!

3528
03:34:45,880 --> 03:34:46,880
Oh, no!

3529
03:34:46,880 --> 03:34:48,880
Oh, no!

3530
03:34:48,880 --> 03:34:51,880
Oh, no!

3531
03:34:58,880 --> 03:35:00,880
Where could she be?

3532
03:35:00,880 --> 03:35:01,880
This is no good.

3533
03:35:01,880 --> 03:35:05,880
We'll never find her wondering about like this.

3534
03:35:05,880 --> 03:35:07,880
Moomin, over here.

3535
03:35:07,880 --> 03:35:09,880
You found her?

3536
03:35:12,880 --> 03:35:14,880
There she is.

3537
03:35:21,880 --> 03:35:24,880
Try to cheer up, Snork Maiden.

3538
03:35:24,880 --> 03:35:25,880
I'll try.

3539
03:35:25,880 --> 03:35:27,880
Don't worry, Snork Maiden.

3540
03:35:27,880 --> 03:35:29,880
Moomin Papa will find her for sure.

3541
03:35:29,880 --> 03:35:31,880
Eh?

3542
03:35:32,880 --> 03:35:35,880
Mama, Snork Maiden!

3543
03:35:37,880 --> 03:35:39,880
Oh, no!

3544
03:35:43,880 --> 03:35:45,880
I'm so glad to see you.

3545
03:35:45,880 --> 03:35:48,880
But I just knew you'd be alright.

3546
03:35:49,880 --> 03:35:53,880
Like Moomin Mama said, little lie really is indestructible.

3547
03:35:53,880 --> 03:35:57,880
But just possibly it served her right to have her hair pulled.

3548
03:36:02,880 --> 03:36:04,880
Hmm, there's still no sign of little lie?

3549
03:36:04,880 --> 03:36:06,880
No.

3550
03:36:11,880 --> 03:36:13,880
Be careful, Moomin!

3551
03:36:19,880 --> 03:36:21,880
Go!

3552
03:36:25,880 --> 03:36:27,880
Hang on, Moomin!

3553
03:36:27,880 --> 03:36:29,880
To me, Moomin Papa!

3554
03:36:32,880 --> 03:36:35,880
Finally, Lenin was rescued too.

3555
03:36:35,880 --> 03:36:40,880
But he only certainly had a fine worst scar than little lie.

3556
03:36:43,880 --> 03:36:50,880
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

3557
03:36:50,880 --> 03:36:57,880
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

3558
03:36:58,880 --> 03:37:01,880
They're always happy and goes at play.

3559
03:37:01,880 --> 03:37:05,880
The Moons are having fun day after day.

3560
03:37:05,880 --> 03:37:08,880
The Moons!

3561
03:37:08,880 --> 03:37:12,880
The Moons!

3562
03:37:12,880 --> 03:37:18,880
The Moons!

3563
03:37:28,880 --> 03:37:34,880
Here they are for one and all.

3564
03:37:34,880 --> 03:37:37,880
The Moons are about to call.

3565
03:37:37,880 --> 03:37:40,880
Come on and sit down here with me.

3566
03:37:40,880 --> 03:37:43,880
They're here for you on your TV.

3567
03:37:43,880 --> 03:37:45,880
They are the Moons.

3568
03:37:45,880 --> 03:37:48,880
They are the Moons.

3569
03:37:49,880 --> 03:37:52,880
So come with me, give me your hand.

3570
03:37:52,880 --> 03:37:55,880
I'll take you up to Moomin Land.

3571
03:37:55,880 --> 03:37:57,880
You can fly just like a bird.

3572
03:37:57,880 --> 03:38:00,880
Sing the best song ever.

3573
03:38:00,880 --> 03:38:02,880
There were the Moons.

3574
03:38:02,880 --> 03:38:05,880
There were the Moons.

3575
03:38:05,880 --> 03:38:07,880
There were the Moons.

3576
03:38:07,880 --> 03:38:10,880
There were the Moons.

3577
03:38:10,880 --> 03:38:13,880
There were the Moons.

3578
03:38:13,880 --> 03:38:16,880
There were the Moons.

3579
03:38:17,880 --> 03:38:20,880
There were the Moons.

3580
03:38:20,880 --> 03:38:23,880
There were the Moons.

3581
03:38:23,880 --> 03:38:26,880
There were the Moons.

3582
03:38:41,880 --> 03:38:45,880
These days, women and snuffkin were together even more than ever.

3583
03:38:46,880 --> 03:39:01,880
Winter would hit Moomin Valley any day now, and then they would have to part.

3584
03:39:01,880 --> 03:39:09,880
Moomin, to go into hibernation and snuck into me for his trip south.

3585
03:39:09,880 --> 03:39:14,880
Huh? Well, why? You look sad for something upset you?

3586
03:39:14,880 --> 03:39:18,880
Where are you off to, Moomin? To the lonely mountains.

3587
03:39:18,880 --> 03:39:21,880
How come you two are always stealing off somewhere?

3588
03:39:21,880 --> 03:39:25,880
We're not stealing off. We're just going for a walk to lonely mountains.

3589
03:39:25,880 --> 03:39:30,880
Just the two of you? You're even worse than usual, never taking any of us with you.

3590
03:39:30,880 --> 03:39:33,880
I hadn't noticed are we really doing that?

3591
03:39:33,880 --> 03:39:35,880
I'm not sure, maybe we are.

3592
03:39:35,880 --> 03:39:39,880
No, maybe he's about it and let me tell you it's very rude.

3593
03:39:39,880 --> 03:39:43,880
But we were just off for a walk. I know. Well then, why are you going?

3594
03:39:43,880 --> 03:39:48,880
It'll start snowing any day now, little might, and then we won't be able to go anywhere, will we?

3595
03:39:48,880 --> 03:39:52,880
We wanted a last look at Moomin Valley from above before that happens.

3596
03:39:52,880 --> 03:39:53,880
A likely story.

3597
03:39:53,880 --> 03:39:59,880
But it's true. I'm off very soon, and I wanted to see it all to give me a picture to remember while I'm walking.

3598
03:39:59,880 --> 03:40:03,880
Hmm. Did you hear that, Snarkman? Sniff, come here!

3599
03:40:07,880 --> 03:40:11,880
Moomin, do you mind if we come along with you? Of course not.

3600
03:40:11,880 --> 03:40:16,880
You see, we thought you were probably plotting something secret and weren't letting any of us in on it.

3601
03:40:16,880 --> 03:40:21,880
Oh, come on, we don't have any secrets from you. It's just that, well, you know what I mean.

3602
03:40:21,880 --> 03:40:24,880
Sniff can be leaving for months and months very soon.

3603
03:40:24,880 --> 03:40:26,880
Never mind, off we go.

3604
03:40:34,880 --> 03:40:38,880
It would be fun to see it all from here in the middle of winter all white.

3605
03:40:38,880 --> 03:40:40,880
It must be very beautiful.

3606
03:40:40,880 --> 03:40:41,880
Oh, I don't think so.

3607
03:40:41,880 --> 03:40:43,880
With everything white and clean?

3608
03:40:43,880 --> 03:40:45,880
In summer, it's very beautiful.

3609
03:40:45,880 --> 03:40:49,880
Well, I'm coming back here in winter to see it for myself.

3610
03:40:49,880 --> 03:40:51,880
You can't do that, you're hibernating.

3611
03:40:51,880 --> 03:40:56,880
Well, maybe not. I thought that this year I'd try to keep awake all winter.

3612
03:40:56,880 --> 03:40:59,880
You mean just like Moomin and I did last year? Yes!

3613
03:40:59,880 --> 03:41:01,880
You could never do it.

3614
03:41:01,880 --> 03:41:04,880
What about you? Are you hibernating?

3615
03:41:04,880 --> 03:41:09,880
I'm not all that mad about the snow and the cold and dark, so I'll hibernate.

3616
03:41:09,880 --> 03:41:13,880
I'm very happy to be going home. I've seen it all now.

3617
03:41:13,880 --> 03:41:16,880
Well, we didn't ask you to come along a little light.

3618
03:41:16,880 --> 03:41:20,880
Why don't we go take a look at that beautiful lake against Sniff, the one with the golden fish?

3619
03:41:20,880 --> 03:41:22,880
Oh, no, that's too far away.

3620
03:41:22,880 --> 03:41:26,880
You're just afraid of the forest of witches, aren't you, Sniff?

3621
03:41:26,880 --> 03:41:28,880
Not at all, I'm not a bit scared.

3622
03:41:28,880 --> 03:41:31,880
Hey, look! Who's that?

3623
03:41:35,880 --> 03:41:37,880
Nobody I know.

3624
03:41:37,880 --> 03:41:38,880
Wonder what she's doing here.

3625
03:41:38,880 --> 03:41:39,880
Sitting down.

3626
03:41:39,880 --> 03:41:41,880
Don't say such silly things, Sniff.

3627
03:41:48,880 --> 03:41:49,880
Hello there.

3628
03:41:49,880 --> 03:41:50,880
Hello there.

3629
03:41:50,880 --> 03:41:53,880
What are you doing up there?

3630
03:41:54,880 --> 03:41:55,880
I'm waiting.

3631
03:41:55,880 --> 03:41:57,880
For what? For grandma.

3632
03:41:57,880 --> 03:41:59,880
Out here all alone.

3633
03:41:59,880 --> 03:42:05,880
Well, grandma told me there was a big rock by the path leading up to Lonely Mountains and to wait there.

3634
03:42:05,880 --> 03:42:08,880
But there are other rocks by the path, you know?

3635
03:42:08,880 --> 03:42:09,880
Or there?

3636
03:42:11,880 --> 03:42:14,880
But this is the only one I've seen so far.

3637
03:42:14,880 --> 03:42:17,880
Your grandma must be crazy or something making you wait in a place like this.

3638
03:42:17,880 --> 03:42:21,880
No, our house is in the forest and she's coming to show me the way.

3639
03:42:21,880 --> 03:42:22,880
In the forest?

3640
03:42:22,880 --> 03:42:24,880
You mean the forest of witches?

3641
03:42:24,880 --> 03:42:28,880
Yes, I suppose so. It's not very far from here.

3642
03:42:28,880 --> 03:42:30,880
That's it, definitely.

3643
03:42:30,880 --> 03:42:32,880
How long have you been waiting here?

3644
03:42:32,880 --> 03:42:33,880
About an hour.

3645
03:42:33,880 --> 03:42:34,880
One hour?

3646
03:42:34,880 --> 03:42:36,880
She's not very punctual.

3647
03:42:36,880 --> 03:42:38,880
Perhaps I was early.

3648
03:42:38,880 --> 03:42:40,880
Yes, she was an hour early.

3649
03:42:40,880 --> 03:42:42,880
Oh, it's grandma.

3650
03:42:46,880 --> 03:42:48,880
Welcome, Alicia.

3651
03:42:52,880 --> 03:42:55,880
Where do you find all these children, my dear?

3652
03:42:55,880 --> 03:42:59,880
I hear all alone and then they came along the path and waited to help.

3653
03:42:59,880 --> 03:43:01,880
Very kind of you, I'm sure.

3654
03:43:01,880 --> 03:43:05,880
Well, don't just stand there, my dear. Let's go.

3655
03:43:05,880 --> 03:43:07,880
Come along.

3656
03:43:11,880 --> 03:43:15,880
Excuse me, excuse me, ma'am, but don't you live in the forest?

3657
03:43:15,880 --> 03:43:17,880
Indeed I do.

3658
03:43:17,880 --> 03:43:19,880
In what part of it?

3659
03:43:19,880 --> 03:43:21,880
Let me see. It must be about right in the middle.

3660
03:43:21,880 --> 03:43:23,880
Interesting.

3661
03:43:23,880 --> 03:43:27,880
The only place I know of is an old house where they say witches used to live.

3662
03:43:27,880 --> 03:43:29,880
You don't say, young man.

3663
03:43:29,880 --> 03:43:33,880
Well, what do you know? What will he think of next?

3664
03:43:46,880 --> 03:43:48,880
Her grandmother is...

3665
03:43:48,880 --> 03:43:50,880
A witch, I think?

3666
03:43:50,880 --> 03:43:52,880
But surely, they don't exist.

3667
03:43:52,880 --> 03:43:56,880
Of course not, like dragons don't exist.

3668
03:43:56,880 --> 03:43:58,880
Well, she doesn't seem like a nasty one.

3669
03:43:58,880 --> 03:44:00,880
How can you tell, moment?

3670
03:44:00,880 --> 03:44:04,880
I don't think that nice girl would have a bad one for a grandma.

3671
03:44:04,880 --> 03:44:06,880
Perhaps not.

3672
03:44:06,880 --> 03:44:10,880
So tell me what makes you think she's a witch, eh?

3673
03:44:10,880 --> 03:44:13,880
Who else could live in that forest, Papa?

3674
03:44:13,880 --> 03:44:16,880
I can't think of anyone right now, but some people would like it.

3675
03:44:16,880 --> 03:44:18,880
Yes, I suppose you're right.

3676
03:44:18,880 --> 03:44:20,880
I hope you are.

3677
03:44:20,880 --> 03:44:24,880
I've lived in Moomin Valley for a long time and I've never once seen a witch.

3678
03:44:24,880 --> 03:44:26,880
So they don't exist?

3679
03:44:30,880 --> 03:44:31,880
Yes.

3680
03:44:31,880 --> 03:44:33,880
Oh, stop working now, Snorke. Dinner's ready.

3681
03:44:33,880 --> 03:44:35,880
Fine, coming.

3682
03:44:39,880 --> 03:44:42,880
No wonder it's so light. Look, the moon is up.

3683
03:44:42,880 --> 03:44:48,880
Snorke, Maiden, I think it would be very wise for you to stay with the Moomin's from tonight on.

3684
03:44:48,880 --> 03:44:50,880
Why on earth do you think that's Snorke?

3685
03:44:50,880 --> 03:44:53,880
I've decided not to hibernate this winter.

3686
03:44:53,880 --> 03:44:55,880
Why ever not?

3687
03:44:55,880 --> 03:44:59,880
I want to complete the blueprint for my new flying ship by next spring.

3688
03:44:59,880 --> 03:45:03,880
For a real inventor, sleep is an unnecessary luxury.

3689
03:45:03,880 --> 03:45:08,880
Science, my dear Snorke, Maiden, will not wait while inventors take a nap.

3690
03:45:08,880 --> 03:45:12,880
But you know, dear Snorke, how dependent you are on your sleep.

3691
03:45:12,880 --> 03:45:13,880
I'll stay with you.

3692
03:45:13,880 --> 03:45:17,880
Very well, then, this winter I will hibernate with the Moomin's.

3693
03:45:17,880 --> 03:45:22,880
Excellent. Shall we have dinner? I'm ready now.

3694
03:45:31,880 --> 03:45:35,880
Most certainly, Snorke. Snorke Maiden will be just fine here with us.

3695
03:45:35,880 --> 03:45:37,880
Thank you.

3696
03:45:37,880 --> 03:45:41,880
This is nice for Moomin, too. Now he'll have Snorke Maiden to keep him company.

3697
03:45:41,880 --> 03:45:42,880
Yes.

3698
03:45:42,880 --> 03:45:45,880
But who needs company when they're hibernating?

3699
03:45:45,880 --> 03:45:47,880
After all, Moomin will be fast asleep.

3700
03:45:47,880 --> 03:45:51,880
Never the less. Sleeping is much nicer when someone else sleeps in the same room.

3701
03:45:51,880 --> 03:45:54,880
When do we start hibernating, do you think?

3702
03:45:54,880 --> 03:45:57,880
With weather like this in another few days, I guess.

3703
03:45:57,880 --> 03:45:58,880
So early?

3704
03:45:58,880 --> 03:46:00,880
We'll have snow before the week is out.

3705
03:46:00,880 --> 03:46:02,880
Well, good luck with your new blueprint, Snorke.

3706
03:46:02,880 --> 03:46:05,880
I look forward to seeing your flying ship in the spring.

3707
03:46:05,880 --> 03:46:09,880
Hmm, come this time next year. I'll definitely be flying about.

3708
03:46:13,880 --> 03:46:15,880
Thanks again for taking Snorke Maiden.

3709
03:46:15,880 --> 03:46:18,880
It's not trouble at all. Good night, then.

3710
03:46:18,880 --> 03:46:19,880
Good night, Snorke.

3711
03:46:19,880 --> 03:46:21,880
See you, Snorke Maiden.

3712
03:46:21,880 --> 03:46:23,880
Bye.

3713
03:46:23,880 --> 03:46:26,880
Good luck this winter, Snorke.

3714
03:46:31,880 --> 03:46:35,880
Thank goodness at last I can really concentrate on my work.

3715
03:46:38,880 --> 03:46:40,880
Huh?

3716
03:46:43,880 --> 03:46:46,880
I don't believe this.

3717
03:46:50,880 --> 03:46:52,880
Am I hallucinating?

3718
03:47:03,880 --> 03:47:05,880
Hello?

3719
03:47:06,880 --> 03:47:08,880
Oh!

3720
03:47:13,880 --> 03:47:19,880
Oh, which I'm sure it was. I'm positive. I'm a broomstick.

3721
03:47:19,880 --> 03:47:22,880
And when the Snorke gets an idea in his head,

3722
03:47:22,880 --> 03:47:25,880
it's not much room for anyone or anything else, is there?

3723
03:47:25,880 --> 03:47:27,880
I hope you'll succeed this time.

3724
03:47:27,880 --> 03:47:30,880
At least in my dream that rounding really flew well.

3725
03:47:30,880 --> 03:47:34,880
I often dream that I fly, but I wouldn't dream of trying it out.

3726
03:47:34,880 --> 03:47:37,880
Snorke must have had some sort of a new idea.

3727
03:47:39,880 --> 03:47:41,880
It's Snorke.

3728
03:47:43,880 --> 03:47:46,880
What's the matter?

3729
03:47:56,880 --> 03:47:59,880
Oh, that's my piece of cake.

3730
03:48:00,880 --> 03:48:02,880
You look like you've seen a ghost.

3731
03:48:02,880 --> 03:48:05,880
Not a ghost. She laughed at me.

3732
03:48:05,880 --> 03:48:08,880
Who did? She was flying on a broom.

3733
03:48:08,880 --> 03:48:09,880
No engine at all.

3734
03:48:09,880 --> 03:48:11,880
Are you talking about the witch?

3735
03:48:11,880 --> 03:48:14,880
There's no point if you can do it so easily.

3736
03:48:14,880 --> 03:48:16,880
Pull yourself together.

3737
03:48:16,880 --> 03:48:17,880
You really swore?

3738
03:48:17,880 --> 03:48:18,880
Yes.

3739
03:48:18,880 --> 03:48:19,880
But where?

3740
03:48:19,880 --> 03:48:21,880
Right near here.

3741
03:48:27,880 --> 03:48:30,880
I can't see any witch up there, Snorke.

3742
03:48:30,880 --> 03:48:32,880
Just the moon up in the sky.

3743
03:48:42,880 --> 03:48:44,880
And she was really flying in the sky?

3744
03:48:44,880 --> 03:48:46,880
Is that what Snorke said?

3745
03:48:46,880 --> 03:48:49,880
Well, he should know about things that fly.

3746
03:48:49,880 --> 03:48:52,880
But I just can't believe it until I've seen it myself.

3747
03:48:52,880 --> 03:48:55,880
If she really is a witch, then what about the girl?

3748
03:48:55,880 --> 03:48:58,880
I mean, no one could be happy living with a witch.

3749
03:48:58,880 --> 03:49:01,880
I really don't know. I thought witches had to be old.

3750
03:49:01,880 --> 03:49:05,880
Maybe it's not her real grandmother. She could be adopted.

3751
03:49:05,880 --> 03:49:08,880
Well, moment, we must get to the bottom of this.

3752
03:49:08,880 --> 03:49:10,880
Yes, Snuffkin. We must.

3753
03:49:12,880 --> 03:49:13,880
Huh.

3754
03:49:18,880 --> 03:49:21,880
Ha, I caught you at it again, you and your secret plan.

3755
03:49:21,880 --> 03:49:23,880
Where are you going?

3756
03:49:23,880 --> 03:49:25,880
Today you can't come with us with a little fly.

3757
03:49:25,880 --> 03:49:26,880
And why not?

3758
03:49:26,880 --> 03:49:28,880
Because we're going on a dangerous mission.

3759
03:49:28,880 --> 03:49:30,880
We're going to the forest of witches.

3760
03:49:30,880 --> 03:49:35,880
Well, if you're in any danger, then I must certainly come along to look after you, Moon.

3761
03:49:35,880 --> 03:49:36,880
Come on.

3762
03:49:38,880 --> 03:49:40,880
Besides, nothing's exciting to happen to me since I went up with that kite.

3763
03:49:41,880 --> 03:49:43,880
This is so exciting.

3764
03:49:43,880 --> 03:49:48,880
Ha, sleeping only through a set of four that I must cram in one adventure first.

3765
03:49:48,880 --> 03:49:51,880
This is what we'll do. I grabbed the witch and while she's helpless,

3766
03:49:51,880 --> 03:49:53,880
you two grab the girl and whisk her away to safety.

3767
03:49:53,880 --> 03:49:57,880
That sounds great, but we don't know if she is a witch, little Mai.

3768
03:49:57,880 --> 03:50:02,880
If we grab her and she isn't a witch, it would be embarrassing and we could all be in trouble.

3769
03:50:02,880 --> 03:50:07,880
Maybe the witch needed an innocent maiden to try out some potions to experiment on her.

3770
03:50:07,880 --> 03:50:09,880
Maybe, let's find out.

3771
03:50:09,880 --> 03:50:10,880
How do we find out?

3772
03:50:10,880 --> 03:50:12,880
By snooping around, I suppose.

3773
03:50:12,880 --> 03:50:16,880
I hope you'll think of something a bit better than that before we get there.

3774
03:50:16,880 --> 03:50:21,880
Let's hide as close to the house as we can and then ask the girl as soon as she comes out.

3775
03:50:22,880 --> 03:50:25,880
And what if she doesn't come out, Snuffkin?

3776
03:50:25,880 --> 03:50:27,880
Then we'll improvise, little Mai.

3777
03:50:27,880 --> 03:50:30,880
So this is the famous plan by the great Snuffkin.

3778
03:50:30,880 --> 03:50:35,880
Look, if she doesn't come out of the house, we'll just go up and knock on the door.

3779
03:50:36,880 --> 03:50:41,880
Once we're inside, I'm sure we'll be able to tell what's really what.

3780
03:50:41,880 --> 03:50:44,880
I don't think it's a very good idea.

3781
03:50:44,880 --> 03:50:46,880
What if she catches us, Bell?

3782
03:50:46,880 --> 03:50:50,880
Little Mai will wait outside and if we don't come out, she can run back to Moomin Valley for help.

3783
03:50:50,880 --> 03:50:54,880
That's fine, but Moomin can wait outside and I'll search the house.

3784
03:50:54,880 --> 03:50:58,880
Oh no, little Mai, you can wait outside and I will search the house.

3785
03:50:58,880 --> 03:50:59,880
Let's do it this way.

3786
03:50:59,880 --> 03:51:02,880
You stay outside and if we get caught, try to free us.

3787
03:51:02,880 --> 03:51:06,880
And run for help as quickly as you can only if you can't.

3788
03:51:06,880 --> 03:51:07,880
Is that okay?

3789
03:51:07,880 --> 03:51:11,880
Hmm, that means if you're in trouble, your lives will be in my hands.

3790
03:51:11,880 --> 03:51:12,880
That's right, little Mai.

3791
03:51:12,880 --> 03:51:14,880
I don't like this out of this.

3792
03:51:14,880 --> 03:51:17,880
I'm not sure I want little Mai to be my last hope.

3793
03:51:17,880 --> 03:51:20,880
Well, I wouldn't now but anyone who doesn't trust me, that's for sure.

3794
03:51:20,880 --> 03:51:21,880
Here's that?

3795
03:51:21,880 --> 03:51:22,880
See what I mean?

3796
03:51:22,880 --> 03:51:24,880
Be quiet.

3797
03:51:25,880 --> 03:51:26,880
There's a house.

3798
03:51:32,880 --> 03:51:33,880
Look at this.

3799
03:51:33,880 --> 03:51:37,880
It's very quiet, do you think there's anybody home?

3800
03:51:37,880 --> 03:51:39,880
I don't know, let's wait a while and see.

3801
03:51:39,880 --> 03:51:42,880
Do we have to stay absolutely still?

3802
03:51:42,880 --> 03:51:43,880
But of course we do.

3803
03:51:43,880 --> 03:51:47,880
We'll feel extremely silly if the house is empty.

3804
03:51:47,880 --> 03:51:49,880
They disappeared.

3805
03:51:49,880 --> 03:51:51,880
They could have told us where they were going.

3806
03:51:51,880 --> 03:51:52,880
I'm sure I don't care.

3807
03:51:52,880 --> 03:51:54,880
Little Mai went too, I think.

3808
03:51:54,880 --> 03:51:57,880
She's betrayed us, that's just like her.

3809
03:51:57,880 --> 03:52:00,880
Don't worry, I've got a pretty good idea where they were heading for.

3810
03:52:00,880 --> 03:52:02,880
You know where they've gone?

3811
03:52:02,880 --> 03:52:04,880
Why didn't you tell me, where are they?

3812
03:52:04,880 --> 03:52:07,880
They've gone to the forest of witches.

3813
03:52:07,880 --> 03:52:08,880
What?

3814
03:52:08,880 --> 03:52:11,880
They've gone to see whether the woman we met yesterday is a real witch.

3815
03:52:11,880 --> 03:52:13,880
A real one?

3816
03:52:13,880 --> 03:52:15,880
Why don't we go there too?

3817
03:52:15,880 --> 03:52:18,880
I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find my way, Sniff.

3818
03:52:18,880 --> 03:52:20,880
What is it?

3819
03:52:20,880 --> 03:52:23,880
I don't know, it's my stomach, I better lie down.

3820
03:52:23,880 --> 03:52:27,880
Oh, it's very painful.

3821
03:52:28,880 --> 03:52:32,880
Oh, how much longer we can have to stay here like this.

3822
03:52:32,880 --> 03:52:35,880
This adventure isn't the least bit exciting.

3823
03:52:35,880 --> 03:52:37,880
Well, let's wait a little bit longer.

3824
03:52:37,880 --> 03:52:40,880
Be quiet, at least we know the girl is definitely in there.

3825
03:52:40,880 --> 03:52:43,880
No, we don't, she might be out, she could be anywhere.

3826
03:52:43,880 --> 03:52:46,880
I know that's possible, but I don't think so.

3827
03:52:51,880 --> 03:52:53,880
She's getting some water.

3828
03:52:53,880 --> 03:52:56,880
As I thought, that bitch is working her to the bone.

3829
03:52:56,880 --> 03:52:58,880
Hey, little boy.

3830
03:52:58,880 --> 03:53:00,880
She's following that girl.

3831
03:53:00,880 --> 03:53:03,880
You go with her, moving and find out as much as you possibly can about what's going on.

3832
03:53:03,880 --> 03:53:05,880
I'll watch the house.

3833
03:53:05,880 --> 03:53:07,880
Right.

3834
03:53:08,880 --> 03:53:10,880
Hey, wait for me.

3835
03:53:26,880 --> 03:53:29,880
Oh.

3836
03:53:56,880 --> 03:53:59,880
Oh.

3837
03:53:59,880 --> 03:54:04,880
If you're looking for Alicia, she's out.

3838
03:54:29,880 --> 03:54:30,880
Oh, stop.

3839
03:54:30,880 --> 03:54:31,880
Listen.

3840
03:54:31,880 --> 03:54:33,880
Wait and see.

3841
03:54:33,880 --> 03:54:35,880
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

3842
03:54:35,880 --> 03:54:38,880
Why did you try to run away then?

3843
03:54:43,880 --> 03:54:45,880
Oh, I'll help you with that.

3844
03:54:45,880 --> 03:54:46,880
So will I.

3845
03:54:46,880 --> 03:54:47,880
How kind of you.

3846
03:54:47,880 --> 03:54:49,880
It is a bit heavy to carry, you know.

3847
03:54:49,880 --> 03:54:51,880
I think I remember your name.

3848
03:54:51,880 --> 03:54:52,880
Is it Alicia?

3849
03:54:52,880 --> 03:54:53,880
Yes, it is.

3850
03:54:53,880 --> 03:54:55,880
I'm so glad you remembered it.

3851
03:54:55,880 --> 03:54:56,880
My name is Lulman.

3852
03:54:56,880 --> 03:54:57,880
And I'm Lulman.

3853
03:54:57,880 --> 03:55:00,880
What are you doing here in the forest of witches?

3854
03:55:00,880 --> 03:55:04,880
Well, to be perfectly honest, we came because we were rather worried about you.

3855
03:55:04,880 --> 03:55:06,880
What about me? Why is that?

3856
03:55:06,880 --> 03:55:09,880
Is that a woman really your grandmother?

3857
03:55:09,880 --> 03:55:10,880
Of course.

3858
03:55:10,880 --> 03:55:11,880
You're quite sure?

3859
03:55:11,880 --> 03:55:12,880
Yes, of course.

3860
03:55:12,880 --> 03:55:14,880
She's my mother's mother.

3861
03:55:14,880 --> 03:55:15,880
Why do you ask?

3862
03:55:15,880 --> 03:55:17,880
Well, don't you know?

3863
03:55:17,880 --> 03:55:18,880
He's trying to ask.

3864
03:55:18,880 --> 03:55:19,880
That's cool.

3865
03:55:19,880 --> 03:55:22,880
Well, maybe your grandmother is a witch.

3866
03:55:22,880 --> 03:55:23,880
Yes, she is.

3867
03:55:23,880 --> 03:55:24,880
Of course.

3868
03:55:24,880 --> 03:55:26,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

3869
03:55:26,880 --> 03:55:28,880
I was a bit taken aback.

3870
03:55:28,880 --> 03:55:31,880
You don't mind about your grandmother being a real witch?

3871
03:55:31,880 --> 03:55:32,880
Oh, no.

3872
03:55:32,880 --> 03:55:33,880
That's what she is.

3873
03:55:33,880 --> 03:55:34,880
I was husband.

3874
03:55:34,880 --> 03:55:37,880
I'm going to be one, two, and I'm grown up.

3875
03:55:37,880 --> 03:55:38,880
Oh, no.

3876
03:55:38,880 --> 03:55:39,880
You couldn't.

3877
03:55:39,880 --> 03:55:41,880
Well, you don't look anything like one.

3878
03:55:41,880 --> 03:55:43,880
Well, that's because I'm not one yet.

3879
03:55:43,880 --> 03:55:46,880
When you're born into a witch family, that's what you become.

3880
03:55:46,880 --> 03:55:48,880
But it's not that easy, you know.

3881
03:55:48,880 --> 03:55:50,880
Oh, this is too much.

3882
03:55:50,880 --> 03:55:51,880
Now, tell me.

3883
03:55:51,880 --> 03:55:54,880
What are you doing here in the forest of witches?

3884
03:55:54,880 --> 03:55:56,880
You don't sound like a witch.

3885
03:55:56,880 --> 03:55:57,880
Oh, really?

3886
03:55:57,880 --> 03:55:59,880
What do witches sound like?

3887
03:55:59,880 --> 03:56:02,880
Well, to be honest, you're the first one I've ever met in my whole life.

3888
03:56:02,880 --> 03:56:05,880
I'm sure that's just what you think, young man.

3889
03:56:05,880 --> 03:56:08,880
Is it true that the nice girl is really your granddaughter?

3890
03:56:08,880 --> 03:56:09,880
Certainly.

3891
03:56:09,880 --> 03:56:11,880
A very promising young girl.

3892
03:56:11,880 --> 03:56:15,880
Honest and hardworking, and with a lot of training, she will make an excellent witch someday.

3893
03:56:15,880 --> 03:56:18,880
But how can you possibly turn such a sweet girl into a witch?

3894
03:56:18,880 --> 03:56:21,880
The sweetest girls make the best witches.

3895
03:56:21,880 --> 03:56:23,880
Hello, didn't know you were back, grandma.

3896
03:56:23,880 --> 03:56:25,880
Thank you for getting the water, Alicia.

3897
03:56:25,880 --> 03:56:27,880
Oh, who's that?

3898
03:56:27,880 --> 03:56:28,880
I don't know.

3899
03:56:28,880 --> 03:56:32,880
Some naive young man ought to rescue a damsel in distress now.

3900
03:56:32,880 --> 03:56:34,880
I remember you, your snuffkin.

3901
03:56:34,880 --> 03:56:35,880
Yes.

3902
03:56:38,880 --> 03:56:40,880
Your friend's snuffkins in here.

3903
03:56:40,880 --> 03:56:41,880
Why don't you come in, too?

3904
03:56:41,880 --> 03:56:42,880
In the house?

3905
03:56:42,880 --> 03:56:43,880
Really?

3906
03:56:43,880 --> 03:56:45,880
He's brought friends with him, hasn't he?

3907
03:56:45,880 --> 03:56:47,880
Self-killed.

3908
03:56:47,880 --> 03:56:49,880
Whatever they don't do to you.

3909
03:56:49,880 --> 03:56:51,880
I'll take care of that.

3910
03:56:51,880 --> 03:56:52,880
Wait a second.

3911
03:56:52,880 --> 03:56:53,880
I'll do it for you.

3912
03:56:53,880 --> 03:56:54,880
I'll fix it.

3913
03:57:00,880 --> 03:57:01,880
Wait.

3914
03:57:01,880 --> 03:57:02,880
I'm gonna need you again.

3915
03:57:02,880 --> 03:57:03,880
Where are you going?

3916
03:57:03,880 --> 03:57:06,880
I don't think that snake ever got bitten before.

3917
03:57:06,880 --> 03:57:08,880
I'll get another.

3918
03:57:08,880 --> 03:57:09,880
I'm very curious.

3919
03:57:09,880 --> 03:57:11,880
Why are you free here, huh?

3920
03:57:11,880 --> 03:57:15,880
They came all the way from Moomin Valley because they were really worried about me, grandma.

3921
03:57:15,880 --> 03:57:17,880
Weren't about you?

3922
03:57:17,880 --> 03:57:18,880
Yes.

3923
03:57:18,880 --> 03:57:19,880
They thought you might be nasty to me.

3924
03:57:19,880 --> 03:57:22,880
So they came all this way to see if I needed help.

3925
03:57:22,880 --> 03:57:24,880
This always happens.

3926
03:57:24,880 --> 03:57:29,880
People treat witches as if they weren't ordinary, respectable, responsible citizens.

3927
03:57:29,880 --> 03:57:31,880
No, no, we're very sorry.

3928
03:57:31,880 --> 03:57:32,880
We realize.

3929
03:57:32,880 --> 03:57:37,880
She's quite okay, and she's most welcome to visit us in Moomin Valley at any time.

3930
03:57:37,880 --> 03:57:38,880
Isn't she snuffkin?

3931
03:57:38,880 --> 03:57:39,880
Yes, certainly.

3932
03:57:40,880 --> 03:57:41,880
What?

3933
03:57:41,880 --> 03:57:43,880
You said you'd visit these people?

3934
03:57:43,880 --> 03:57:44,880
Oh, yes.

3935
03:57:44,880 --> 03:57:48,880
I thought I'd go over there sometimes after I'd finished with my homework, of course.

3936
03:57:48,880 --> 03:57:50,880
I would never leave my studies half done.

3937
03:57:50,880 --> 03:57:57,880
Sorry, Alicia, but if you ever want to become a good witch, you mustn't see any ordinary mortals.

3938
03:57:57,880 --> 03:57:58,880
Oh, why not?

3939
03:57:58,880 --> 03:58:01,880
I've only just become friends with them, grandma, please.

3940
03:58:01,880 --> 03:58:02,880
I know.

3941
03:58:02,880 --> 03:58:06,880
Why don't I wait a year and study to be a witch next year?

3942
03:58:06,880 --> 03:58:07,880
Alicia.

3943
03:58:10,880 --> 03:58:12,880
This is family business.

3944
03:58:12,880 --> 03:58:15,880
So if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you were to leave.

3945
03:58:16,880 --> 03:58:19,880
I'd like you to go immediately if you please.

3946
03:58:30,880 --> 03:58:32,880
It's snowing.

3947
03:58:33,880 --> 03:58:39,880
Well, she certainly won't be able to visit us if Moomin Valley is buried in snow, so we might never see her again.

3948
03:58:39,880 --> 03:58:41,880
No, that's right.

3949
03:58:41,880 --> 03:58:44,880
And you'll be leaving soon, won't you, snuffkin?

3950
03:58:45,880 --> 03:58:49,880
Winter had come once again to Moomin Valley.

3951
03:59:01,880 --> 03:59:08,880
They loved the laughter and they loved the living, the movements.

3952
03:59:08,880 --> 03:59:15,880
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

3953
03:59:15,880 --> 03:59:19,880
They're always happy and goes at play.

3954
03:59:19,880 --> 03:59:23,880
The Moons are having fun day after day.

3955
03:59:23,880 --> 03:59:26,880
The Moons.

3956
03:59:26,880 --> 03:59:30,880
The Moons.

3957
03:59:30,880 --> 03:59:36,880
The Moons.

3958
03:59:38,880 --> 03:59:44,880
The Moons.

3959
03:59:44,880 --> 03:59:49,880
The Moons.

3960
03:59:49,880 --> 03:59:53,880
The Moons.

3961
03:59:53,880 --> 03:59:56,880
The Moons.

3962
03:59:56,880 --> 03:59:59,880
The Moons.

3963
03:59:59,880 --> 04:00:02,880
Here they are for one and all.

3964
04:00:02,880 --> 04:00:05,880
The Moons are about to call.

3965
04:00:05,880 --> 04:00:08,480
I wanna sit down here with me

3966
04:00:08,480 --> 04:00:11,080
Therefore you aren't your TV

3967
04:00:11,080 --> 04:00:13,880
They are the movements

3968
04:00:13,880 --> 04:00:16,880
They are the movements

3969
04:00:16,880 --> 04:00:20,080
So come with me, give me your hand

3970
04:00:20,080 --> 04:00:23,080
I'll take you up to a moment land

3971
04:00:23,080 --> 04:00:25,880
You can fly just like a bird

3972
04:00:25,880 --> 04:00:28,280
Sing the best song ever

3973
04:00:28,280 --> 04:00:31,280
There were the movements

3974
04:00:31,280 --> 04:00:34,280
There were the movements

3975
04:00:34,280 --> 04:00:37,080
There were the movements

3976
04:00:37,080 --> 04:00:40,080
There were the movements

3977
04:00:40,080 --> 04:00:42,880
There were the movements

3978
04:00:42,880 --> 04:00:49,880
There were the movements

3979
04:00:49,880 --> 04:00:52,880
The snow was getting thicker on the ground

3980
04:00:52,880 --> 04:00:58,880
and it was high time for the movements to start hibernating

3981
04:01:04,280 --> 04:01:11,280
I'm so glad I've come to see you today instead of leaving a town

3982
04:01:11,280 --> 04:01:15,280
I'm so glad I've come to see you today

3983
04:01:15,280 --> 04:01:17,280
Instead of leaving a town

3984
04:01:17,280 --> 04:01:19,280
What are you doing, my man?

3985
04:01:19,280 --> 04:01:20,280
Alicia!

3986
04:01:20,280 --> 04:01:22,280
What are you doing with these pine needles?

3987
04:01:22,280 --> 04:01:24,280
That's what we always eat before we hibernate

3988
04:01:24,280 --> 04:01:25,280
Nobody knows why

3989
04:01:25,280 --> 04:01:27,280
So you're gonna start hibernating

3990
04:01:27,280 --> 04:01:29,280
Yes tonight

3991
04:01:29,280 --> 04:01:30,280
Oh, that's soon?

3992
04:01:30,280 --> 04:01:31,280
Yes

3993
04:01:31,280 --> 04:01:33,280
I'm so glad I've come to see you today

3994
04:01:33,280 --> 04:01:37,280
Instead of leaving until tomorrow then

3995
04:01:37,280 --> 04:01:40,280
I must say you came on just the right day, Alicia

3996
04:01:40,280 --> 04:01:43,280
We usually have a small party the night we start hibernating

3997
04:01:43,280 --> 04:01:45,280
and you've arrived just in time

3998
04:01:45,280 --> 04:01:48,280
Oh, you mean I can stay for that woman, mama?

3999
04:01:48,280 --> 04:01:51,280
And by the way, Alicia is a matter of interest

4000
04:01:51,280 --> 04:01:53,280
It's the witch, sorry, your grandmother

4001
04:01:53,280 --> 04:01:54,280
I mean, know that you're here?

4002
04:01:54,280 --> 04:01:56,280
No, I'm afraid I didn't tell her

4003
04:01:56,280 --> 04:01:58,280
Better for grownups not to know too much

4004
04:01:58,280 --> 04:02:00,280
Oh, do you say you're right?

4005
04:02:00,280 --> 04:02:03,280
I'm afraid she's not very happy for me to come here to Moomin Valley

4006
04:02:03,280 --> 04:02:05,280
Oh, I have a lot my dear

4007
04:02:05,280 --> 04:02:08,280
I guess she's afraid that if I start coming here to play

4008
04:02:08,280 --> 04:02:11,280
I shall lose interest in studying hard at my witchcraft

4009
04:02:11,280 --> 04:02:14,280
Oh, but you've got a very long time to go before you're a witch

4010
04:02:14,280 --> 04:02:18,280
It takes anything between five to seven years nowadays

4011
04:02:18,280 --> 04:02:21,280
Are you really sure that's what you want to be, Alicia?

4012
04:02:21,280 --> 04:02:23,280
Study something out

4013
04:02:23,280 --> 04:02:24,280
But I want to be a witch

4014
04:02:24,280 --> 04:02:27,280
Perhaps you don't know, but witches aren't terribly popular

4015
04:02:28,280 --> 04:02:30,280
Yes, I do, but I won't be like that

4016
04:02:30,280 --> 04:02:31,280
I'll be popular

4017
04:02:34,280 --> 04:02:36,280
Hey, Snuffkin!

4018
04:02:39,280 --> 04:02:41,280
You're off to the moments?

4019
04:02:41,280 --> 04:02:42,280
Yes

4020
04:02:43,280 --> 04:02:45,280
I thought you'd gone south already

4021
04:02:45,280 --> 04:02:48,280
Last winter you'd gone before the snow started

4022
04:02:48,280 --> 04:02:50,280
Not this year, I promised Moomin

4023
04:02:50,280 --> 04:02:51,280
Promise

4024
04:02:51,280 --> 04:02:54,280
I promised not to leave Moomin Valley until he went into hibernation

4025
04:02:58,280 --> 04:03:00,280
Everybody seems to be here

4026
04:03:00,280 --> 04:03:02,280
And somebody knew

4027
04:03:02,280 --> 04:03:03,280
Who's that?

4028
04:03:03,280 --> 04:03:04,280
Half a guess

4029
04:03:04,280 --> 04:03:05,280
Hmm

4030
04:03:05,280 --> 04:03:08,280
Ah, very well then, it's Alicia, that's my guess

4031
04:03:08,280 --> 04:03:10,280
Ah, how did you know?

4032
04:03:10,280 --> 04:03:11,280
What?

4033
04:03:11,280 --> 04:03:12,280
I'm right?

4034
04:03:12,280 --> 04:03:15,280
Yes, you are, but I think you peaked and saw her earlier on

4035
04:03:15,280 --> 04:03:18,280
I didn't, I just named somebody I thought couldn't be here

4036
04:03:18,280 --> 04:03:19,280
Clever, huh?

4037
04:03:19,280 --> 04:03:21,280
Well, she just happened to stop by

4038
04:03:21,280 --> 04:03:22,280
She's with papa

4039
04:03:22,280 --> 04:03:24,280
Who's showing her around the house

4040
04:03:24,280 --> 04:03:26,280
Is the witch here, too?

4041
04:03:26,280 --> 04:03:29,280
No, she didn't tell the witch she was coming here

4042
04:03:29,280 --> 04:03:31,280
Just as well, thank goodness

4043
04:03:34,280 --> 04:03:36,280
Ah, it's you, Snuffkin

4044
04:03:36,280 --> 04:03:39,280
I finally came over, I told you I would

4045
04:03:39,280 --> 04:03:40,280
Hi

4046
04:03:40,280 --> 04:03:41,280
Remember our friend here?

4047
04:03:41,280 --> 04:03:43,280
He's called Sniff

4048
04:03:43,280 --> 04:03:45,280
Hi, how do you do Sniff?

4049
04:03:45,280 --> 04:03:50,280
Well, you aren't gonna use your magic to cast any spells and stuff, are you?

4050
04:03:50,280 --> 04:03:52,280
No

4051
04:03:57,280 --> 04:04:01,280
Actually, they didn't need just pine needles for dinner that evening

4052
04:04:01,280 --> 04:04:03,280
They had lots of other nice things, too

4053
04:04:03,280 --> 04:04:05,280
All cooked by Mum and Mama

4054
04:04:05,280 --> 04:04:08,280
Snuffkin, I'd like to say how story I am

4055
04:04:08,280 --> 04:04:09,280
Why?

4056
04:04:09,280 --> 04:04:13,280
I persuaded you to stay on here instead of going south as you'd planned

4057
04:04:13,280 --> 04:04:14,280
I'm leaving tomorrow

4058
04:04:14,280 --> 04:04:17,280
But the snow is quite deep

4059
04:04:17,280 --> 04:04:19,280
Don't worry, I'm used to deep snow

4060
04:04:19,280 --> 04:04:23,280
I'm just worried Alicia will find it hard to get home in this

4061
04:04:23,280 --> 04:04:28,280
Well, she could spell the night here, but of course tomorrow will be asleep for the winter, so...

4062
04:04:32,280 --> 04:04:33,280
Huh?

4063
04:04:33,280 --> 04:04:35,280
Hmm, someone's at the door

4064
04:04:35,280 --> 04:04:37,280
I'll see who it is

4065
04:04:43,280 --> 04:04:45,280
Oh, hello, how are you?

4066
04:04:47,280 --> 04:04:49,280
Hello indeed, my young man

4067
04:04:49,280 --> 04:04:51,280
My granddaughter is here, isn't she?

4068
04:04:52,280 --> 04:04:54,280
Who is it that moment?

4069
04:04:54,280 --> 04:04:56,280
Oh, my dear

4070
04:04:56,280 --> 04:04:58,280
You must be Mum and Papa

4071
04:05:02,280 --> 04:05:04,280
Now, you listen to me, Mum and Papa

4072
04:05:04,280 --> 04:05:08,280
I don't want my granddaughter playing with your children under any circumstances

4073
04:05:08,280 --> 04:05:10,280
Do I make myself quite clear?

4074
04:05:10,280 --> 04:05:12,280
But Alicia likes playing with us

4075
04:05:12,280 --> 04:05:13,280
Grandma!

4076
04:05:13,280 --> 04:05:14,280
We're leaving

4077
04:05:14,280 --> 04:05:16,280
Can't I stay a little longer?

4078
04:05:16,280 --> 04:05:19,280
Hello, you're most welcome to stay and have dinner with us

4079
04:05:19,280 --> 04:05:21,280
Don't you know I'm a witch?

4080
04:05:21,280 --> 04:05:23,280
I can't eat that sort of baby food

4081
04:05:23,280 --> 04:05:25,280
Alicia quite likes the food

4082
04:05:25,280 --> 04:05:28,280
The pine needles look okay, the rest is yucky

4083
04:05:28,280 --> 04:05:29,280
Come, Alicia

4084
04:05:29,280 --> 04:05:30,280
Please, let me stay, Grandma

4085
04:05:30,280 --> 04:05:32,280
Certainly not, young lady

4086
04:05:32,280 --> 04:05:35,280
I've told you before, which is never mixed with people like this

4087
04:05:35,280 --> 04:05:37,280
And that goes for novice, which is as well

4088
04:05:37,280 --> 04:05:38,280
Never

4089
04:05:38,280 --> 04:05:40,280
But they're nice, they're really our Grandma

4090
04:05:40,280 --> 04:05:42,280
And I told you, that's the trouble

4091
04:05:42,280 --> 04:05:45,280
They are disgustingly, signally good

4092
04:05:46,280 --> 04:05:49,280
You will hear a lot more about this when we get home

4093
04:05:49,280 --> 04:05:51,280
Come on now

4094
04:05:51,280 --> 04:05:55,280
It's really cold out here, and there's a lot more snow on the way

4095
04:05:56,280 --> 04:05:58,280
All right, I'm coming, Grandma

4096
04:05:58,280 --> 04:05:59,280
Coming

4097
04:05:59,280 --> 04:06:00,280
Oh, thank you

4098
04:06:00,280 --> 04:06:02,280
Mum and Papa

4099
04:06:02,280 --> 04:06:03,280
Yeah

4100
04:06:03,280 --> 04:06:05,280
We understand each other now, don't we?

4101
04:06:05,280 --> 04:06:07,280
I'm sure you understand me

4102
04:06:07,280 --> 04:06:08,280
Never mind about that

4103
04:06:08,280 --> 04:06:12,280
You and your whole family are never to speak to my granddaughter again

4104
04:06:12,280 --> 04:06:14,280
Is that understood?

4105
04:06:14,280 --> 04:06:16,280
But Grandma

4106
04:06:16,280 --> 04:06:19,280
Mind what I say over a vengeance of touch will come upon you

4107
04:06:19,280 --> 04:06:21,280
Or even the revenge of a serious

4108
04:06:21,280 --> 04:06:24,280
If you think cheap threats like that impress Mum and Papa

4109
04:06:24,280 --> 04:06:26,280
You're making a grave mistake

4110
04:06:26,280 --> 04:06:29,280
Mum and Papa is a highly educated gentleman

4111
04:06:29,280 --> 04:06:32,280
But I am a witch with three diplomas

4112
04:06:32,280 --> 04:06:33,280
Maybe so

4113
04:06:33,280 --> 04:06:37,280
But tell me, how can three diplomas help you to get home with all this snow

4114
04:06:37,280 --> 04:06:40,280
Ha, child's play to an accredited witch

4115
04:06:40,280 --> 04:06:42,280
Come, Alicia

4116
04:06:43,280 --> 04:06:47,280
I've never seen one of these before, a little pep square

4117
04:06:47,280 --> 04:06:50,280
Is that really a witch's broom?

4118
04:06:50,280 --> 04:06:51,280
Well, I never

4119
04:06:51,280 --> 04:06:53,280
Let's go and see

4120
04:06:53,280 --> 04:06:57,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

4121
04:06:57,280 --> 04:06:58,280
I'm ready!

4122
04:06:58,280 --> 04:06:59,280
Cold on died, Alicia

4123
04:06:59,280 --> 04:07:02,280
Okay, can you both ride on that broom?

4124
04:07:02,280 --> 04:07:06,280
It looks pretty scrappy to me, could fall to pieces, any minute

4125
04:07:06,280 --> 04:07:09,280
Do drive slowly in this weather

4126
04:07:09,280 --> 04:07:11,280
Oh, please don't fall off, Alicia

4127
04:07:11,280 --> 04:07:13,280
But terrible chatterboxes you all are

4128
04:07:13,280 --> 04:07:15,280
Please keep quiet all of you

4129
04:07:16,280 --> 04:07:18,280
Are you ready, girl?

4130
04:07:18,280 --> 04:07:19,280
Yeah

4131
04:07:19,280 --> 04:07:21,280
Bet they'll never be able to take off

4132
04:07:21,280 --> 04:07:22,280
Huh?

4133
04:07:22,280 --> 04:07:29,280
Ahhh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

4134
04:07:35,280 --> 04:07:37,280
This is nó!

4135
04:07:37,280 --> 04:07:38,280
Oh, this is new at fall

4136
04:07:38,280 --> 04:07:39,280
Come on!

4137
04:07:45,640 --> 04:07:47,000
What is it, Grandma?

4138
04:07:47,000 --> 04:07:48,000
Nothing!

4139
04:07:48,000 --> 04:07:49,000
Oh!

4140
04:07:49,840 --> 04:07:50,840
Ah!

4141
04:07:52,120 --> 04:07:53,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

4142
04:07:53,840 --> 04:07:55,840
Just what I thought, they're too heavy!

4143
04:07:56,840 --> 04:07:59,840
Listen, I could take Alicia's place, I'm not too heavy!

4144
04:08:00,600 --> 04:08:03,000
Don't worry, I'm happy to walk home, Grandma!

4145
04:08:03,000 --> 04:08:04,920
Don't be so ridiculous, child!

4146
04:08:04,920 --> 04:08:06,840
You can't walk home in all this snow!

4147
04:08:06,840 --> 04:08:07,720
You'll never make it!

4148
04:08:07,720 --> 04:08:09,400
Only I had some skis!

4149
04:08:09,400 --> 04:08:11,400
Come on, climb aboard!

4150
04:08:11,400 --> 04:08:12,600
I'll try another spell!

4151
04:08:13,640 --> 04:08:16,600
Grandma, are you worried because all those people are watching you?

4152
04:08:16,600 --> 04:08:17,400
Shut up!

4153
04:08:17,400 --> 04:08:19,000
And help me say the magic spell!

4154
04:08:21,640 --> 04:08:22,440
Go ahead!

4155
04:08:32,600 --> 04:08:33,800
They're doing it!

4156
04:08:33,800 --> 04:08:34,600
They're doing it!

4157
04:08:37,880 --> 04:08:39,440
Yeah, yeah!

4158
04:08:46,840 --> 04:08:47,560
Oh.

4159
04:08:49,480 --> 04:08:51,040
Where do we go?

4160
04:08:58,320 --> 04:08:59,560
Oh!

4161
04:09:01,800 --> 04:09:02,600
Hey!

4162
04:09:02,600 --> 04:09:04,520
Where's the magic spell?

4163
04:09:04,520 --> 04:09:06,200
You are in the water, good bye!

4164
04:09:07,720 --> 04:09:10,220
Oh, stop it, Mama!

4165
04:09:11,220 --> 04:09:14,720
She may have three diplomas, but I don't think she's very good, Mama.

4166
04:09:14,720 --> 04:09:17,720
I wish they'd sing to the ground so I could fly that room.

4167
04:09:17,720 --> 04:09:20,720
Guess they're all right now, Mum and Papa.

4168
04:09:20,720 --> 04:09:22,720
Let's go back to our dinner.

4169
04:09:30,720 --> 04:09:34,720
Oh, I forgot to thank them for asking me to stand at dinner.

4170
04:09:34,720 --> 04:09:38,720
Thank them indeed. I don't think you're cut out to be a witch.

4171
04:09:38,720 --> 04:09:40,720
Oh, but Grandma, I don't want to be one.

4172
04:09:40,720 --> 04:09:44,720
Well, I'm quite happy to help, but the path will certainly be a difficult one.

4173
04:09:44,720 --> 04:09:46,720
Oh? Oh.

4174
04:09:46,720 --> 04:09:48,720
Mama!

4175
04:10:05,720 --> 04:10:07,720
Oh.

4176
04:10:21,720 --> 04:10:25,720
With Alessia and the witch gone home to the Valley of the Witches,

4177
04:10:25,720 --> 04:10:30,720
Snuffkin departed for his trip south, and the Moomins went into hibernation.

4178
04:10:34,720 --> 04:10:49,720
They certainly would have slept till the beginning of the spring, as usual, but this year.

4179
04:10:57,720 --> 04:11:01,720
Quite unexpectedly, something happened.

4180
04:11:04,720 --> 04:11:07,720
Go away, Master!

4181
04:11:07,720 --> 04:11:10,720
Let's get out.

4182
04:11:16,720 --> 04:11:19,720
Scums!

4183
04:11:19,720 --> 04:11:23,720
Go away!

4184
04:11:24,720 --> 04:11:26,720
Oh.

4185
04:11:26,720 --> 04:11:28,720
G-

4186
04:11:28,720 --> 04:11:30,720
Oh.

4187
04:11:30,720 --> 04:11:32,720
Huh?

4188
04:11:32,720 --> 04:11:57,720
There's someone at the window.

4189
04:11:57,720 --> 04:12:01,720
There's someone at the window.

4190
04:12:02,720 --> 04:12:11,720
It's frozen shut.

4191
04:12:19,720 --> 04:12:22,720
Hey, why did you wake me up?

4192
04:12:22,720 --> 04:12:24,720
Well, you shouldn't be asleep.

4193
04:12:24,720 --> 04:12:26,720
Didn't you know Christmas is coming?

4194
04:12:26,720 --> 04:12:29,720
It's tomorrow, so there's not a minute to be lost.

4195
04:12:29,720 --> 04:12:31,720
Christmas is coming tomorrow.

4196
04:12:31,720 --> 04:12:33,720
But who on earth is that?

4197
04:12:33,720 --> 04:12:35,720
Why? Who is Christmas?

4198
04:12:35,720 --> 04:12:37,720
This isn't a joke moment.

4199
04:12:37,720 --> 04:12:39,720
I'm not in the least ready.

4200
04:12:39,720 --> 04:12:41,720
I've lost my mittens and Christmas is coming

4201
04:12:41,720 --> 04:12:43,720
and I haven't got a fir tree yet.

4202
04:12:43,720 --> 04:12:46,720
A fir tree, I really must get a fir tree.

4203
04:12:49,720 --> 04:12:50,720
How very odd.

4204
04:12:50,720 --> 04:12:52,720
Why a fir tree?

4205
04:12:52,720 --> 04:12:54,720
Hey!

4206
04:12:54,720 --> 04:12:56,720
Why?

4207
04:12:56,720 --> 04:12:58,720
Oh, what's that moment?

4208
04:13:00,720 --> 04:13:04,720
Well, Christmas is almost coming and we don't have a fir tree yet.

4209
04:13:04,720 --> 04:13:06,720
Christmas?

4210
04:13:06,720 --> 04:13:07,720
Hmm.

4211
04:13:07,720 --> 04:13:09,720
Did you say Christmas is coming?

4212
04:13:09,720 --> 04:13:11,720
Yes, and before that, one must have a fir tree.

4213
04:13:11,720 --> 04:13:13,720
What's this about a fir tree?

4214
04:13:13,720 --> 04:13:17,720
Well, you need one to protect ourselves against this Christmas person, Mumma.

4215
04:13:17,720 --> 04:13:20,720
I'm not really quite clear on that point.

4216
04:13:20,720 --> 04:13:23,720
But there's something awful that has to be kept away, right?

4217
04:13:24,720 --> 04:13:26,720
Ah, keep it up.

4218
04:13:26,720 --> 04:13:28,720
I better go get a fir tree.

4219
04:13:42,720 --> 04:13:45,720
Ha, about the time you move in, Scotta.

4220
04:13:45,720 --> 04:13:47,720
How are you going to see?

4221
04:13:47,720 --> 04:13:49,720
Pretty good fir tree, Dad.

4222
04:13:50,720 --> 04:13:52,720
Well, thank you, Gavsie.

4223
04:13:52,720 --> 04:13:54,720
But could you tell me something?

4224
04:13:54,720 --> 04:13:56,720
What is one supposed to do with it?

4225
04:13:58,720 --> 04:14:00,720
I'm really moving, Papa.

4226
04:14:00,720 --> 04:14:03,720
The way you can joke with such a straight face.

4227
04:14:03,720 --> 04:14:04,720
Joke?

4228
04:14:04,720 --> 04:14:05,720
Eh?

4229
04:14:05,720 --> 04:14:09,720
Love to stay, but I haven't even finished cooking yet.

4230
04:14:12,720 --> 04:14:13,720
I wasn't joking.

4231
04:14:13,720 --> 04:14:15,720
No one believe me, either.

4232
04:14:20,720 --> 04:14:23,720
Would you like a little more, young man?

4233
04:14:23,720 --> 04:14:24,720
No, thank you very much.

4234
04:14:24,720 --> 04:14:26,720
I'm really nice and warm again now.

4235
04:14:26,720 --> 04:14:30,720
I saw a moment, Papa, and a moment bring up a big tree.

4236
04:14:30,720 --> 04:14:32,720
But what is one supposed to do with it?

4237
04:14:32,720 --> 04:14:33,720
Don't you know?

4238
04:14:33,720 --> 04:14:35,720
No.

4239
04:14:35,720 --> 04:14:38,720
Why, you decorate it as beautifully as you can.

4240
04:14:38,720 --> 04:14:39,720
Really?

4241
04:14:43,720 --> 04:14:46,720
Christmas is coming, so I better be off.

4242
04:14:46,720 --> 04:14:48,720
Everyone's talking of Christmas.

4243
04:14:48,720 --> 04:14:49,720
I know.

4244
04:14:49,720 --> 04:14:51,720
I've got a long way to go.

4245
04:14:53,720 --> 04:14:55,720
Take care, dear.

4246
04:15:01,720 --> 04:15:02,720
Hello.

4247
04:15:02,720 --> 04:15:03,720
Hello.

4248
04:15:06,720 --> 04:15:08,720
Bye-bye!

4249
04:15:08,720 --> 04:15:09,720
Bye-bye!

4250
04:15:09,720 --> 04:15:11,720
Goodbye.

4251
04:15:12,720 --> 04:15:13,720
Who was that?

4252
04:15:13,720 --> 04:15:14,720
I don't know.

4253
04:15:14,720 --> 04:15:17,720
He was in a hurry to get somewhere before Christmas.

4254
04:15:17,720 --> 04:15:19,720
Oh, I gave him some tea.

4255
04:15:19,720 --> 04:15:20,720
That was nice.

4256
04:15:20,720 --> 04:15:23,720
And he told us what to do with the fir tree.

4257
04:15:23,720 --> 04:15:24,720
What did he say?

4258
04:15:24,720 --> 04:15:26,720
To decorate it beautifully.

4259
04:15:26,720 --> 04:15:29,720
Decorate it, but why should we do that, Mama?

4260
04:15:29,720 --> 04:15:33,720
I guess we must decorate the tree to make sure we keep Christmas happy.

4261
04:15:33,720 --> 04:15:34,720
Yes, you're right.

4262
04:15:34,720 --> 04:15:36,720
We'd better start doing it right away.

4263
04:15:36,720 --> 04:15:39,720
Yes, I'm sure there's not a moment to lose.

4264
04:15:39,720 --> 04:15:40,720
No.

4265
04:15:40,720 --> 04:15:41,720
Mama?

4266
04:15:41,720 --> 04:15:42,720
Yes, dear.

4267
04:15:42,720 --> 04:15:45,720
They also say we have to cook lots of food for Christmas.

4268
04:15:45,720 --> 04:15:46,720
Goodness.

4269
04:15:46,720 --> 04:15:48,720
Well, at least he won't be eating us then.

4270
04:15:57,720 --> 04:15:58,720
Here.

4271
04:15:58,720 --> 04:16:00,720
And thank you, Snorkmaid.

4272
04:16:00,720 --> 04:16:04,720
Oh, the ship means rather a rock to me.

4273
04:16:04,720 --> 04:16:06,720
It will look fantastic on the tree, Papa.

4274
04:16:06,720 --> 04:16:07,720
Yes, dear.

4275
04:16:07,720 --> 04:16:08,720
I suppose you're right.

4276
04:16:09,720 --> 04:16:15,720
Oh, why don't we put this at the top?

4277
04:16:15,720 --> 04:16:17,720
This is Mars.

4278
04:16:17,720 --> 04:16:20,720
Don't worry.

4279
04:16:20,720 --> 04:16:24,720
Mmm, that looks beautiful.

4280
04:16:24,720 --> 04:16:27,720
Listen, everybody.

4281
04:16:27,720 --> 04:16:31,720
I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas, too.

4282
04:16:31,720 --> 04:16:32,720
Really?

4283
04:16:33,720 --> 04:16:37,720
I just heard that you need to get lots of presents for Christmas, too.

4284
04:16:37,720 --> 04:16:39,720
Really, Mama?

4285
04:16:39,720 --> 04:16:42,720
I don't wonder what this Christmas will be like.

4286
04:16:42,720 --> 04:16:46,720
What if it's an awful greedy, beastly monster like the grove?

4287
04:16:46,720 --> 04:16:47,720
Don't worry, Snorkmaid.

4288
04:16:47,720 --> 04:16:50,720
We'll give him lots of presents and stuff him full of food.

4289
04:16:55,720 --> 04:16:58,720
Have you thought of any presents for Christmas yet?

4290
04:16:58,720 --> 04:17:00,720
I don't know what to give him.

4291
04:17:00,720 --> 04:17:02,720
Look, a seashell.

4292
04:17:02,720 --> 04:17:04,720
Oh, that's a beauty.

4293
04:17:07,720 --> 04:17:10,720
Oh, look, Mama, what I got for Christmas.

4294
04:17:10,720 --> 04:17:13,720
I'm going to give him a pretty lure for fishing.

4295
04:17:13,720 --> 04:17:15,720
I'm giving him this book.

4296
04:17:15,720 --> 04:17:16,720
Great presents.

4297
04:17:16,720 --> 04:17:20,720
I'm sure he'll be very happy with the moment family and not Thomas at all.

4298
04:17:31,720 --> 04:17:33,720
I think Christmas will come any moment now.

4299
04:17:33,720 --> 04:17:35,720
So do I.

4300
04:17:35,720 --> 04:17:36,720
Oh, dear.

4301
04:17:36,720 --> 04:17:39,720
I do hope he likes my pumpkin pie.

4302
04:17:39,720 --> 04:17:40,720
He will.

4303
04:17:40,720 --> 04:17:43,720
Imagine everyone in Moomin Valley being frightened.

4304
04:17:43,720 --> 04:17:44,720
Mmm.

4305
04:17:54,720 --> 04:17:55,720
Are you sleepy?

4306
04:17:55,720 --> 04:17:56,720
Yes, I am.

4307
04:17:56,720 --> 04:17:59,720
I can't stay this scared for much longer.

4308
04:18:00,720 --> 04:18:03,720
Better come before all the food freezes.

4309
04:18:03,720 --> 04:18:04,720
Oh.

4310
04:18:07,720 --> 04:18:08,720
He's coming.

4311
04:18:11,720 --> 04:18:15,720
I never thought Christmas could be that small.

4312
04:18:15,720 --> 04:18:17,720
Merry Christmas.

4313
04:18:17,720 --> 04:18:20,720
Merry Christmas. Is that what he is?

4314
04:18:20,720 --> 04:18:22,720
Well, it's just what you say.

4315
04:18:22,720 --> 04:18:26,720
All of my life I have dreamed of seeing all this up close, honestly.

4316
04:18:27,720 --> 04:18:30,720
I never really thought a Christmas tree could be this beautiful.

4317
04:18:30,720 --> 04:18:32,720
Brought my friends, too.

4318
04:18:32,720 --> 04:18:34,720
You're all very welcome.

4319
04:18:34,720 --> 04:18:36,720
Oh, thank you.

4320
04:18:36,720 --> 04:18:37,720
Hear that, everybody?

4321
04:18:37,720 --> 04:18:39,720
We're all very welcome.

4322
04:18:39,720 --> 04:18:40,720
Woo!

4323
04:18:40,720 --> 04:18:41,720
Man, let's get him.

4324
04:18:41,720 --> 04:18:43,720
There's some wonderful things here.

4325
04:18:43,720 --> 04:18:44,720
Yeah!

4326
04:18:46,720 --> 04:18:48,720
Oh, what a lot of food you've made.

4327
04:18:48,720 --> 04:18:51,720
Yes, all the food there is for Christmas.

4328
04:18:51,720 --> 04:18:53,720
And are those real presents?

4329
04:18:53,720 --> 04:18:55,720
They are.

4330
04:18:55,720 --> 04:18:59,720
All of my life, I've sort of wondered about those things called presents.

4331
04:18:59,720 --> 04:19:02,720
Papa, I don't think these creatures are Christmas.

4332
04:19:02,720 --> 04:19:04,720
Neither do I.

4333
04:19:12,720 --> 04:19:14,720
You look sleepy.

4334
04:19:14,720 --> 04:19:15,720
I am.

4335
04:19:15,720 --> 04:19:18,720
Must be well past midnight.

4336
04:19:18,720 --> 04:19:21,720
What is Christmas doing, Mama?

4337
04:19:21,720 --> 04:19:23,720
Aren't you sleepy, too, little ones?

4338
04:19:23,720 --> 04:19:27,720
Sleepy with a wonderful Christmas tree like this to look at.

4339
04:19:30,720 --> 04:19:31,720
Hey, Papa.

4340
04:19:31,720 --> 04:19:32,720
What is it?

4341
04:19:32,720 --> 04:19:35,720
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

4342
04:19:35,720 --> 04:19:36,720
Maybe.

4343
04:19:38,720 --> 04:19:41,720
Nobody can get really angry this late at night.

4344
04:19:41,720 --> 04:19:45,720
Surely we'll close the doors and perhaps we'll be safe inside.

4345
04:19:45,720 --> 04:19:47,720
I'm sure you're right.

4346
04:19:47,720 --> 04:19:48,720
Listen, my friends.

4347
04:19:48,720 --> 04:19:51,720
We'd like to give you the tree and the food and the presents.

4348
04:19:52,720 --> 04:19:53,720
What?

4349
04:19:53,720 --> 04:19:54,720
All of this?

4350
04:19:54,720 --> 04:19:55,720
For us?

4351
04:19:55,720 --> 04:19:57,720
Yes, we want to sleep.

4352
04:19:57,720 --> 04:19:59,720
We're far more sleepy than scared.

4353
04:20:03,720 --> 04:20:04,720
Snortman?

4354
04:20:04,720 --> 04:20:06,720
Oh, I see here yet.

4355
04:20:06,720 --> 04:20:09,720
No, but we decided to go back to hibernating.

4356
04:20:10,720 --> 04:20:11,720
Bye-bye.

4357
04:20:28,720 --> 04:20:31,720
I thought Christmas tree should have a star on top.

4358
04:20:31,720 --> 04:20:34,720
I don't think it makes any difference, you know?

4359
04:20:34,720 --> 04:20:37,720
A nice rose is just as good as a star.

4360
04:20:37,720 --> 04:20:38,720
Look at that!

4361
04:21:01,720 --> 04:21:04,720
And apparently it didn't make any difference at all.

4362
04:21:04,720 --> 04:21:07,720
Because the Moonman family slept as peacefully as ever,

4363
04:21:07,720 --> 04:21:13,720
all through the night, without Christmas, coming anywhere near them.

4364
04:21:13,720 --> 04:21:16,720
So probably he went someplace else.

4365
04:21:18,720 --> 04:21:25,720
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

4366
04:21:25,720 --> 04:21:33,720
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

4367
04:21:33,720 --> 04:21:36,720
They're always happy and goes at play.

4368
04:21:36,720 --> 04:21:40,720
The Moons are having fun day after day.

4369
04:21:40,720 --> 04:21:43,720
The Moons.

4370
04:21:43,720 --> 04:21:46,720
The Moons.

4371
04:21:46,720 --> 04:21:48,720
The Moons.

4372
04:21:48,720 --> 04:21:51,720
The Moons.

4373
04:22:03,720 --> 04:22:06,720
The Moons.

4374
04:22:34,720 --> 04:22:37,720
So come with me, give me your hand.

4375
04:22:37,720 --> 04:22:40,720
I'll take you up to a moment land.

4376
04:22:40,720 --> 04:22:43,720
You can fly just like a bird.

4377
04:22:43,720 --> 04:22:45,720
Sing that song ever.

4378
04:22:45,720 --> 04:22:48,720
There were the movements.

4379
04:22:48,720 --> 04:22:51,720
There were the movements.

4380
04:22:51,720 --> 04:22:54,720
There were the movements.

4381
04:22:54,720 --> 04:22:57,720
There were the movements.

4382
04:22:57,720 --> 04:23:00,720
There were the movements.

4383
04:23:00,720 --> 04:23:03,720
There were the movements.

4384
04:23:03,720 --> 04:23:06,720
There were the movements.

4385
04:23:21,720 --> 04:23:23,720
During his long winter sleep,

4386
04:23:23,720 --> 04:23:26,720
Moonman had a dream.

4387
04:23:30,720 --> 04:23:34,720
And strangely enough, he dreamt that he was sleeping.

4388
04:23:34,720 --> 04:23:36,720
Moonman.

4389
04:23:36,720 --> 04:23:38,720
Moonman.

4390
04:23:38,720 --> 04:23:41,720
Huh?

4391
04:23:44,720 --> 04:23:46,720
Alicia.

4392
04:23:46,720 --> 04:23:47,720
Alicia.

4393
04:23:47,720 --> 04:23:50,720
Wow, you can fly on the broomstick now.

4394
04:23:50,720 --> 04:23:53,720
Right, I'm a fully fledged witch now, Moonman.

4395
04:23:53,720 --> 04:23:56,720
Wait, give me a ride, Alicia.

4396
04:23:56,720 --> 04:23:57,720
Can't do that.

4397
04:23:57,720 --> 04:23:59,720
Oh, don't be mean, Alicia.

4398
04:23:59,720 --> 04:24:02,720
Because someone's already riding with me.

4399
04:24:02,720 --> 04:24:04,720
Man, it's me.

4400
04:24:04,720 --> 04:24:05,720
Little boy.

4401
04:24:05,720 --> 04:24:08,720
Would you mind if we went a little higher, Alicia?

4402
04:24:08,720 --> 04:24:10,720
Sure.

4403
04:24:10,720 --> 04:24:12,720
Oh, wow, higher, Alicia.

4404
04:24:12,720 --> 04:24:14,720
Keep going.

4405
04:24:16,720 --> 04:24:18,720
Please, listen.

4406
04:24:18,720 --> 04:24:19,720
Come back.

4407
04:24:19,720 --> 04:24:21,720
Please, give me a ride, Alicia.

4408
04:24:21,720 --> 04:24:23,720
Here you go.

4409
04:24:35,720 --> 04:24:39,720
Oh, thank you, Moonman.

4410
04:24:39,720 --> 04:24:42,720
Will you give me a ride now?

4411
04:24:42,720 --> 04:24:44,720
Come on now.

4412
04:24:49,720 --> 04:24:51,720
Moonman.

4413
04:24:59,720 --> 04:25:02,720
Moonman, Val, he's really beautiful from up here.

4414
04:25:02,720 --> 04:25:05,720
Yes, lovely.

4415
04:25:05,720 --> 04:25:07,720
Oh, Alicia, be careful.

4416
04:25:07,720 --> 04:25:08,720
Don't do things like that.

4417
04:25:08,720 --> 04:25:09,720
What are you talking about?

4418
04:25:09,720 --> 04:25:11,720
We're not doing anything, Moonman.

4419
04:25:11,720 --> 04:25:13,720
A little boy, it's you again.

4420
04:25:13,720 --> 04:25:16,720
No wonder the broom is shaking so much.

4421
04:25:16,720 --> 04:25:17,720
How do you like it?

4422
04:25:17,720 --> 04:25:19,720
I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?

4423
04:25:19,720 --> 04:25:22,720
Where did you get this broom from, little boy?

4424
04:25:22,720 --> 04:25:24,720
I borrowed it from the witch.

4425
04:25:24,720 --> 04:25:25,720
I borrowed it.

4426
04:25:25,720 --> 04:25:26,720
For a while.

4427
04:25:26,720 --> 04:25:28,720
That's the witch, isn't it?

4428
04:25:28,720 --> 04:25:29,720
Looks like it.

4429
04:25:29,720 --> 04:25:31,720
Maybe we better get out of here.

4430
04:25:31,720 --> 04:25:32,720
You're right.

4431
04:25:32,720 --> 04:25:33,720
Stop.

4432
04:25:33,720 --> 04:25:34,720
You two little thieves.

4433
04:25:34,720 --> 04:25:36,720
Give me back my broom at once.

4434
04:25:36,720 --> 04:25:37,720
No.

4435
04:25:37,720 --> 04:25:38,720
Yeah.

4436
04:25:38,720 --> 04:25:39,720
You have your own broom.

4437
04:25:39,720 --> 04:25:41,720
You witches should learn how to share.

4438
04:25:41,720 --> 04:25:43,720
But there's no one who's just a spare.

4439
04:25:43,720 --> 04:25:45,720
I want my veil from back right now.

4440
04:25:45,720 --> 04:25:46,720
Find yours, keepers.

4441
04:25:46,720 --> 04:25:47,720
It's my broom.

4442
04:25:47,720 --> 04:25:48,720
Cut that a broom.

4443
04:25:48,720 --> 04:25:49,720
Huh.

4444
04:25:49,720 --> 04:25:51,720
Why don't you take a closer look at it?

4445
04:25:51,720 --> 04:25:52,720
That's not a broom.

4446
04:25:52,720 --> 04:25:53,720
What do you mean?

4447
04:25:53,720 --> 04:25:54,720
This is not a broom.

4448
04:25:54,720 --> 04:25:55,720
Oh.

4449
04:25:55,720 --> 04:25:56,720
Oh.

4450
04:25:56,720 --> 04:25:57,720
Hey.

4451
04:25:57,720 --> 04:25:58,720
Oh.

4452
04:25:58,720 --> 04:25:59,720
Oh.

4453
04:25:59,720 --> 04:26:00,720
Oh.

4454
04:26:00,720 --> 04:26:01,720
Oh.

4455
04:26:01,720 --> 04:26:02,720
Oh.

4456
04:26:02,720 --> 04:26:03,720
Oh.

4457
04:26:03,720 --> 04:26:04,720
Oh.

4458
04:26:04,720 --> 04:26:05,720
Oh.

4459
04:26:05,720 --> 04:26:06,720
Oh.

4460
04:26:06,720 --> 04:26:07,720
Oh.

4461
04:26:07,720 --> 04:26:08,720
Oh.

4462
04:26:08,720 --> 04:26:09,720
Oh.

4463
04:26:09,720 --> 04:26:10,720
Oh.

4464
04:26:10,720 --> 04:26:11,720
Oh.

4465
04:26:11,720 --> 04:26:12,720
Oh.

4466
04:26:12,720 --> 04:26:13,720
Oh.

4467
04:26:13,720 --> 04:26:14,720
Oh.

4468
04:26:14,720 --> 04:26:15,720
I must have been dreaming.

4469
04:26:15,720 --> 04:26:17,720
You were yelling out loud.

4470
04:26:17,720 --> 04:26:18,720
Oh.

4471
04:26:18,720 --> 04:26:19,720
I'm so sorry.

4472
04:26:19,720 --> 04:26:23,720
I didn't mean to wake you up, Snorkman.

4473
04:26:23,720 --> 04:26:33,720
Can you see anything?

4474
04:26:33,720 --> 04:26:34,720
Only snow.

4475
04:26:34,720 --> 04:26:35,720
Everything's so light.

4476
04:26:35,720 --> 04:26:36,720
Yes.

4477
04:26:36,720 --> 04:26:37,720
The morning's up.

4478
04:26:37,720 --> 04:26:38,720
Oh.

4479
04:26:38,720 --> 04:26:39,720
What an airy light.

4480
04:26:39,720 --> 04:26:40,720
Yes.

4481
04:26:40,720 --> 04:26:41,720
Spring hasn't arrived yet.

4482
04:26:41,720 --> 04:26:42,720
Has it?

4483
04:26:42,720 --> 04:26:43,720
Yes.

4484
04:26:43,720 --> 04:26:45,720
Everybody else is still asleep then?

4485
04:26:45,720 --> 04:26:46,720
Yes.

4486
04:26:46,720 --> 04:26:47,720
Most of them anyway.

4487
04:26:47,720 --> 04:26:49,720
Wonder if my brother's still up.

4488
04:26:49,720 --> 04:26:54,800
Well, he did say before we started hyprinating, he wanted to finish his blueprints before spring

4489
04:26:54,800 --> 04:26:55,800
if he could.

4490
04:26:55,800 --> 04:26:57,720
I hope he'll succeed this time.

4491
04:26:57,720 --> 04:26:58,720
When he go out.

4492
04:26:58,720 --> 04:26:59,720
Huh?

4493
04:26:59,720 --> 04:27:02,720
Outside just to see what the snow looks like.

4494
04:27:02,720 --> 04:27:03,720
Oh, no.

4495
04:27:03,720 --> 04:27:06,720
I don't really feel like it.

4496
04:27:06,720 --> 04:27:07,720
It's nice and warm here.

4497
04:27:07,720 --> 04:27:11,720
Why don't we sleep till spring like the others?

4498
04:27:11,720 --> 04:27:15,720
Spring is still a long way off.

4499
04:27:15,720 --> 04:27:17,720
I guess you're right.

4500
04:27:17,720 --> 04:27:20,720
It is nice and warm in here.

4501
04:27:34,720 --> 04:27:36,720
It's delicious.

4502
04:27:36,720 --> 04:27:39,720
Chocolate cakes, my favorite.

4503
04:27:40,720 --> 04:27:42,720
Did you say something, snorkeweider?

4504
04:27:42,720 --> 04:27:45,720
I'm so very hungry, moment.

4505
04:27:51,720 --> 04:27:54,720
Your mother's raspberry juice is really the best.

4506
04:27:54,720 --> 04:27:55,720
It is, isn't it?

4507
04:27:55,720 --> 04:27:57,720
Everybody said that last winter, too.

4508
04:27:57,720 --> 04:27:58,720
Hey, moment.

4509
04:27:58,720 --> 04:27:59,720
Yeah?

4510
04:27:59,720 --> 04:28:00,720
I have a funny feeling.

4511
04:28:00,720 --> 04:28:02,720
Someone is watching us and I don't like you.

4512
04:28:02,720 --> 04:28:03,720
One little bit.

4513
04:28:03,720 --> 04:28:05,720
Moment, Papa, could explain it.

4514
04:28:05,720 --> 04:28:06,720
I'm sure.

4515
04:28:06,720 --> 04:28:07,720
Of course, someone's watching.

4516
04:28:07,720 --> 04:28:08,720
What?

4517
04:28:08,720 --> 04:28:09,720
But who?

4518
04:28:09,720 --> 04:28:10,720
And how do you know?

4519
04:28:10,720 --> 04:28:11,720
Too thick.

4520
04:28:11,720 --> 04:28:13,720
He told me all about it last winter, snort maiden.

4521
04:28:13,720 --> 04:28:15,720
She doesn't hibernate, you know?

4522
04:28:15,720 --> 04:28:18,720
She lives in our bathhouse and watches over us in the winter.

4523
04:28:18,720 --> 04:28:22,720
She said that many things are too shy to show themselves.

4524
04:28:22,720 --> 04:28:24,720
Oh, have you seen them yourself?

4525
04:28:24,720 --> 04:28:25,720
Sort of.

4526
04:28:25,720 --> 04:28:27,720
Except they were invisible, of course.

4527
04:28:27,720 --> 04:28:29,720
Like under the sink.

4528
04:28:29,720 --> 04:28:31,720
Or in the clock, maybe.

4529
04:28:31,720 --> 04:28:35,720
In the empty fireplace and other dark corners of the room.

4530
04:28:36,720 --> 04:28:39,720
Did you actually look anywhere for them?

4531
04:28:39,720 --> 04:28:40,720
Oh, no.

4532
04:28:40,720 --> 04:28:41,720
They'd be very upset.

4533
04:28:41,720 --> 04:28:44,720
It's better not to let them know we know where they are.

4534
04:28:44,720 --> 04:28:46,720
I wonder what these things look like.

4535
04:28:46,720 --> 04:28:48,720
Some of them look very much like us, too, Tiki said.

4536
04:28:48,720 --> 04:28:51,720
Old ancestors of ours from way back, she thinks.

4537
04:28:51,720 --> 04:28:53,720
Some of them look like us, she said.

4538
04:28:53,720 --> 04:28:55,720
Well, I've never seen them for myself.

4539
04:28:55,720 --> 04:28:58,720
I wonder if there is good looking as we are.

4540
04:28:58,720 --> 04:29:07,720
Wouldn't it be a good idea to stay up and wait for the sunrise?

4541
04:29:07,720 --> 04:29:09,720
A great idea.

4542
04:29:14,720 --> 04:29:16,720
Now, don't say anything to scare them.

4543
04:29:16,720 --> 04:29:20,720
But this is one of the movement's ancestors from way back.

4544
04:29:22,720 --> 04:29:24,720
Is it morning already?

4545
04:29:24,720 --> 04:29:25,720
Are you sure?

4546
04:29:25,720 --> 04:29:26,720
I think so.

4547
04:29:26,720 --> 04:29:29,720
There are no clouds, so why can't we see the sun?

4548
04:29:29,720 --> 04:29:33,720
I guess maybe the sun doesn't come up at all this time of the year.

4549
04:29:33,720 --> 04:29:35,720
Mom and I don't like this.

4550
04:29:35,720 --> 04:29:38,720
I don't like you one little bit.

4551
04:29:38,720 --> 04:29:40,720
You silly little girl.

4552
04:29:40,720 --> 04:29:41,720
What do you need this for?

4553
04:29:41,720 --> 04:29:42,720
Please, grandma.

4554
04:29:42,720 --> 04:29:43,720
I won't be long.

4555
04:29:43,720 --> 04:29:44,720
I promise.

4556
04:29:44,720 --> 04:29:45,720
What are you talking about?

4557
04:29:45,720 --> 04:29:47,720
Is if you could fly a broom.

4558
04:29:47,720 --> 04:29:49,720
Get back back to me at once.

4559
04:29:49,720 --> 04:29:51,720
No, I won't give it back.

4560
04:29:51,720 --> 04:29:52,720
Now give me back that broom.

4561
04:29:52,720 --> 04:29:53,720
And don't be silly.

4562
04:29:53,720 --> 04:29:56,720
How many times from sight tell you you can't go visiting Moomin Valley.

4563
04:29:56,720 --> 04:29:58,720
But it's so boring here.

4564
04:29:58,720 --> 04:30:00,720
I want some company, grandma.

4565
04:30:00,720 --> 04:30:03,720
Come on, broom fly off.

4566
04:30:03,720 --> 04:30:05,720
Take me to Moomin Valley.

4567
04:30:08,720 --> 04:30:11,720
Help me up, grandma.

4568
04:30:11,720 --> 04:30:12,720
Please.

4569
04:30:14,720 --> 04:30:15,720
All right, my girl.

4570
04:30:15,720 --> 04:30:17,720
I'll help you up, shall I?

4571
04:30:17,720 --> 04:30:23,720
I don't believe it.

4572
04:30:23,720 --> 04:30:24,720
I'm floating.

4573
04:30:24,720 --> 04:30:25,720
Oh.

4574
04:30:25,720 --> 04:30:26,720
How far?

4575
04:30:26,720 --> 04:30:27,720
This is great.

4576
04:30:27,720 --> 04:30:28,720
Wait.

4577
04:30:28,720 --> 04:30:29,720
Oh.

4578
04:30:29,720 --> 04:30:30,720
I'm falling.

4579
04:30:30,720 --> 04:30:31,720
Oh.

4580
04:30:31,720 --> 04:30:32,720
Oh.

4581
04:30:32,720 --> 04:30:33,720
Oh.

4582
04:30:33,720 --> 04:30:34,720
How about that of these?

4583
04:30:34,720 --> 04:30:36,720
I don't find them far around here.

4584
04:30:36,720 --> 04:30:37,720
Oh.

4585
04:30:37,720 --> 04:30:39,720
Oh, don't bury things again.

4586
04:30:39,720 --> 04:30:40,720
How about this?

4587
04:30:40,720 --> 04:30:42,720
I don't find them far around here.

4588
04:30:42,720 --> 04:30:43,720
Oh.

4589
04:30:43,720 --> 04:30:45,720
Oh, don't bury things again.

4590
04:30:45,720 --> 04:30:47,720
How about this?

4591
04:30:47,720 --> 04:30:48,720
Oh, no.

4592
04:30:48,720 --> 04:30:49,720
Stop the broom, grandma.

4593
04:30:49,720 --> 04:30:50,720
Please.

4594
04:30:50,720 --> 04:30:51,720
Oh.

4595
04:30:51,720 --> 04:30:52,720
Come on.

4596
04:30:52,720 --> 04:30:54,720
You wanted to ride on the broom, didn't you?

4597
04:30:54,720 --> 04:30:55,720
You first saw the bike.

4598
04:30:55,720 --> 04:30:56,720
Well, here it is.

4599
04:30:56,720 --> 04:30:57,720
Oh.

4600
04:30:57,720 --> 04:30:59,720
Oh.

4601
04:30:59,720 --> 04:31:00,720
Oh, mom.

4602
04:31:00,720 --> 04:31:02,720
Please, don't.

4603
04:31:02,720 --> 04:31:03,720
Oh.

4604
04:31:06,720 --> 04:31:10,720
If you want to learn to fly on this broom, Alicia,

4605
04:31:10,720 --> 04:31:14,720
then forget all about those dreaded movements and really start studying.

4606
04:31:14,720 --> 04:31:16,720
It's hard work, you know, young woman.

4607
04:31:16,720 --> 04:31:18,720
You must learn concentrate.

4608
04:31:24,720 --> 04:31:25,720
Hey, you up there.

4609
04:31:25,720 --> 04:31:27,720
Are you making fun of me, too?

4610
04:31:33,720 --> 04:31:35,720
Oh, I can't climb down there.

4611
04:31:35,720 --> 04:31:36,720
Of course you can.

4612
04:31:36,720 --> 04:31:40,720
Even if you fall, you can't hurt yourself on this soft snow.

4613
04:31:40,720 --> 04:31:42,720
Don't shake the ladder, Moment.

4614
04:31:42,720 --> 04:31:43,720
This is scary.

4615
04:31:43,720 --> 04:31:45,720
Slowly does it.

4616
04:31:45,720 --> 04:31:47,720
Take it easy and don't look down.

4617
04:31:47,720 --> 04:31:50,720
Maybe going out wasn't such a good idea after all.

4618
04:31:50,720 --> 04:31:53,720
We can always change our minds and go back to sleep, you know.

4619
04:31:53,720 --> 04:31:55,720
See, you've made it.

4620
04:31:55,720 --> 04:31:59,720
It's very cold out here, woman, but I rather like it.

4621
04:31:59,720 --> 04:32:00,720
Oh.

4622
04:32:00,720 --> 04:32:04,720
This is the roof over the front door, isn't it?

4623
04:32:04,720 --> 04:32:07,720
Yes, and everything will be snowed up now to spring.

4624
04:32:07,720 --> 04:32:08,720
Oh, no.

4625
04:32:08,720 --> 04:32:10,720
What's happened to our firewood?

4626
04:32:14,720 --> 04:32:16,720
What's the matter?

4627
04:32:16,720 --> 04:32:18,720
There's not much wood left in here.

4628
04:32:18,720 --> 04:32:20,720
Someone else must be burning it.

4629
04:32:20,720 --> 04:32:23,720
Yes, but who and for what I wonder?

4630
04:32:24,720 --> 04:32:26,720
I can feel it.

4631
04:32:26,720 --> 04:32:27,720
We're not alone in this forest.

4632
04:32:27,720 --> 04:32:29,720
I'm sure someone's watching us.

4633
04:32:29,720 --> 04:32:31,720
All those winter creatures.

4634
04:32:31,720 --> 04:32:33,720
No, I don't think it's them.

4635
04:32:37,720 --> 04:32:38,720
The grog.

4636
04:32:38,720 --> 04:32:41,720
Goodness me.

4637
04:32:41,720 --> 04:32:44,720
Look how big she gets in the wintertime.

4638
04:32:44,720 --> 04:32:45,720
Move in.

4639
04:32:45,720 --> 04:32:47,720
I'm scared.

4640
04:32:47,720 --> 04:32:49,720
It'll be all right.

4641
04:32:49,720 --> 04:32:50,720
Grow.

4642
04:32:50,720 --> 04:32:51,720
Stop.

4643
04:32:51,720 --> 04:32:52,720
Right there.

4644
04:32:52,720 --> 04:32:56,720
Don't come any closer if you please.

4645
04:32:56,720 --> 04:32:59,720
You're much, much too cold for us, you see.

4646
04:32:59,720 --> 04:33:02,720
You could freeze a stiff, you know.

4647
04:33:02,720 --> 04:33:03,720
Oh.

4648
04:33:03,720 --> 04:33:06,720
Is it possible that you get cold?

4649
04:33:07,720 --> 04:33:11,720
Is it possible that you get lonely all by yourself?

4650
04:33:11,720 --> 04:33:14,720
I don't think there's anything we can do to help you know.

4651
04:33:14,720 --> 04:33:18,720
Not without fur coats and earmuffs and warm gloves anyway.

4652
04:33:18,720 --> 04:33:20,720
We must go.

4653
04:33:21,720 --> 04:33:22,720
Oh.

4654
04:33:36,720 --> 04:33:38,720
Someone's been stealing our firewood.

4655
04:33:38,720 --> 04:33:40,720
I wonder what they're doing with it.

4656
04:33:40,720 --> 04:33:42,720
Something bad, there's no doubt about that.

4657
04:33:42,720 --> 04:33:45,720
Must've been several people did this.

4658
04:33:51,720 --> 04:33:52,720
Oh.

4659
04:34:02,720 --> 04:34:05,720
We had a lot of fun here in the summer.

4660
04:34:05,720 --> 04:34:06,720
Remember?

4661
04:34:06,720 --> 04:34:09,720
Well, the she is still here round the ice.

4662
04:34:09,720 --> 04:34:10,720
I hope.

4663
04:34:10,720 --> 04:34:12,720
Two, Tiki.

4664
04:34:12,720 --> 04:34:13,720
Two, Tiki.

4665
04:34:15,720 --> 04:34:16,720
There's no one here.

4666
04:34:16,720 --> 04:34:17,720
Are you sure?

4667
04:34:17,720 --> 04:34:18,720
Look for yourself.

4668
04:34:21,720 --> 04:34:24,720
I know they're invisible, but I'm a shroom ice in here.

4669
04:34:24,720 --> 04:34:25,720
Hard to tell.

4670
04:34:25,720 --> 04:34:27,720
Well, things you can't see.

4671
04:34:27,720 --> 04:34:29,720
Oh.

4672
04:34:29,720 --> 04:34:30,720
What is it?

4673
04:34:30,720 --> 04:34:33,720
It felt like something scampering on my back.

4674
04:34:33,720 --> 04:34:34,720
That's all right.

4675
04:34:34,720 --> 04:34:36,720
It must be one of the shroom ice.

4676
04:34:40,720 --> 04:34:41,720
Moman.

4677
04:34:41,720 --> 04:34:42,720
Moman.

4678
04:34:45,720 --> 04:34:47,720
Oh, where could he have gone?

4679
04:34:48,720 --> 04:34:49,720
My goodness.

4680
04:34:49,720 --> 04:34:52,720
I've never seen anything quite like this before.

4681
04:34:52,720 --> 04:34:54,720
Hi, it's good to see you.

4682
04:34:54,720 --> 04:34:55,720
You're right.

4683
04:34:55,720 --> 04:34:56,720
She's fishing.

4684
04:34:56,720 --> 04:34:57,720
Hi, two, Tiki.

4685
04:34:57,720 --> 04:34:59,720
Hello, two, Tiki.

4686
04:34:59,720 --> 04:35:01,720
So this winter's not made in woke up, too, huh?

4687
04:35:01,720 --> 04:35:04,720
I walk her up by mistake.

4688
04:35:04,720 --> 04:35:07,720
You know that spring is still a long way off, don't you?

4689
04:35:07,720 --> 04:35:10,720
I thought it might be seeing there's no sun at all.

4690
04:35:10,720 --> 04:35:13,720
But the sun is going to come back tomorrow, Moman.

4691
04:35:13,720 --> 04:35:14,720
Tomorrow?

4692
04:35:15,720 --> 04:35:18,720
Snork maiden was so worried about the sun not showing.

4693
04:35:18,720 --> 04:35:22,720
The sun will rise tomorrow, Moman, but it'll go down very soon.

4694
04:35:22,720 --> 04:35:26,720
Two Tiki, you know, I think there must be records in Moonwind Valley.

4695
04:35:26,720 --> 04:35:27,720
Records in winter?

4696
04:35:27,720 --> 04:35:31,720
There's an enormous pile of firewood up on the hillside.

4697
04:35:31,720 --> 04:35:32,720
Oh, I know.

4698
04:35:32,720 --> 04:35:34,720
It took a long time to collect that wood.

4699
04:35:34,720 --> 04:35:37,720
But some of it belongs to us.

4700
04:35:37,720 --> 04:35:38,720
Hmm.

4701
04:35:38,720 --> 04:35:40,720
That doesn't really surprise me, though, Moman.

4702
04:35:40,720 --> 04:35:43,720
I'm afraid the winner creatures unfairly careful about ownership.

4703
04:35:43,720 --> 04:35:46,720
They need a lot, so if they see it, they take it.

4704
04:35:46,720 --> 04:35:48,720
It's for their big winner bonfire.

4705
04:35:48,720 --> 04:35:49,720
A bonfire?

4706
04:35:49,720 --> 04:35:53,720
Yes, and now your firewood can take part in the big celebration.

4707
04:35:53,720 --> 04:35:57,720
They light it every winter to make sure the sun comes back, you know.

4708
04:35:57,720 --> 04:36:01,720
Oh, you mean otherwise the sun wouldn't come back to Tiki?

4709
04:36:01,720 --> 04:36:06,720
Well, since they always light it on this day, you don't really know, do you?

4710
04:36:06,720 --> 04:36:08,720
Tonight you might see the winner creatures.

4711
04:36:08,720 --> 04:36:11,720
Oh, can we come along as well to Tiki?

4712
04:36:11,720 --> 04:36:12,720
Yes, you can.

4713
04:36:12,720 --> 04:36:15,720
If you sit quietly and don't scare them in any way.

4714
04:36:15,720 --> 04:36:16,720
Wonderful.

4715
04:36:16,720 --> 04:36:18,720
You're coming along, too, aren't you?

4716
04:36:18,720 --> 04:36:19,720
Of course.

4717
04:36:19,720 --> 04:36:20,720
Stop!

4718
04:36:20,720 --> 04:36:21,720
Help me!

4719
04:36:21,720 --> 04:36:23,720
Someone shouting for help?

4720
04:36:23,720 --> 04:36:24,720
Who could it be?

4721
04:36:24,720 --> 04:36:25,720
Go away!

4722
04:36:25,720 --> 04:36:26,720
Get away from me!

4723
04:36:26,720 --> 04:36:28,720
I didn't do it on purpose!

4724
04:36:28,720 --> 04:36:30,720
I didn't mean any harm!

4725
04:36:30,720 --> 04:36:34,720
If you don't leave me alone, Grandma will turn you into a toad!

4726
04:36:34,720 --> 04:36:36,720
Oh, that's so cold!

4727
04:36:36,720 --> 04:36:37,720
Go away, please!

4728
04:36:37,720 --> 04:36:38,720
Ah!

4729
04:36:38,720 --> 04:36:39,720
Ah!

4730
04:36:39,720 --> 04:36:40,720
Ah!

4731
04:36:40,720 --> 04:36:41,720
Ah!

4732
04:36:41,720 --> 04:36:42,720
Ah!

4733
04:36:42,720 --> 04:36:43,720
Grow!

4734
04:36:43,720 --> 04:36:44,720
Leave her alone!

4735
04:36:44,720 --> 04:36:45,720
What are you doing, Grog?

4736
04:36:45,720 --> 04:36:46,720
Move it!

4737
04:36:46,720 --> 04:36:47,720
Alicia!

4738
04:36:47,720 --> 04:36:48,720
No, listen, Grog.

4739
04:36:48,720 --> 04:36:49,720
Why can't you be nice to her?

4740
04:36:49,720 --> 04:36:50,720
Alicia is one of my friends.

4741
04:36:50,720 --> 04:36:53,720
She was just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis.

4742
04:36:53,720 --> 04:36:56,720
I nearly bumped into her, but I didn't touch her.

4743
04:36:56,720 --> 04:36:58,720
That's all right, Alicia.

4744
04:36:58,720 --> 04:36:59,720
Tell me, Grog.

4745
04:36:59,720 --> 04:37:00,720
Alicia!

4746
04:37:00,720 --> 04:37:01,720
Alicia!

4747
04:37:01,720 --> 04:37:02,720
Now listen, Grog.

4748
04:37:02,720 --> 04:37:03,720
Why can't you be nice to her?

4749
04:37:03,720 --> 04:37:04,720
Alicia is one of my friends.

4750
04:37:04,720 --> 04:37:05,720
She was just standing there looking at nothing when I came down on my skis.

4751
04:37:05,720 --> 04:37:06,720
I nearly bumped into her, but I didn't touch her.

4752
04:37:06,720 --> 04:37:07,720
Tell me, Grog.

4753
04:37:07,720 --> 04:37:08,720
What's gotten into you?

4754
04:37:08,720 --> 04:37:11,720
Why are you so nasty to such a sweet little girl?

4755
04:37:11,720 --> 04:37:13,720
It isn't like you at all.

4756
04:37:13,720 --> 04:37:15,720
I must have startled her, I guess.

4757
04:37:15,720 --> 04:37:18,720
And I did apologize at all, but it made no difference.

4758
04:37:18,720 --> 04:37:20,720
This is really, very odd.

4759
04:37:20,720 --> 04:37:24,720
Then I asked if she had seen you, and that's when she started to get mad at me.

4760
04:37:24,720 --> 04:37:26,720
And she doesn't even know me.

4761
04:37:26,720 --> 04:37:28,720
It's a mystery.

4762
04:37:28,720 --> 04:37:30,720
Whatever's the matter with you, Grog.

4763
04:37:30,720 --> 04:37:46,720
Oh, I was so scared.

4764
04:37:46,720 --> 04:37:48,720
I'm so glad you've come to see us.

4765
04:37:48,720 --> 04:37:50,720
So am I, women.

4766
04:37:50,720 --> 04:37:53,720
Somehow I felt certain you hadn't gone into hibernation yet.

4767
04:37:53,720 --> 04:37:56,720
But what did your grandmother say?

4768
04:37:56,720 --> 04:37:59,720
Nothing because I didn't tell her I was coming.

4769
04:37:59,720 --> 04:38:01,720
Thank you for chasing off that terrible monster.

4770
04:38:01,720 --> 04:38:04,720
The Grog hasn't actually ever attacked anyone.

4771
04:38:04,720 --> 04:38:07,720
Well, maybe she doesn't like the look of Alicia.

4772
04:38:07,720 --> 04:38:09,720
Snork maiden.

4773
04:38:09,720 --> 04:38:12,720
It's really a mystery to me why the Grog was here at all.

4774
04:38:12,720 --> 04:38:15,720
She was here looking for a moment no doubt.

4775
04:38:15,720 --> 04:38:16,720
Was she?

4776
04:38:16,720 --> 04:38:19,720
He suddenly become very popular.

4777
04:38:19,720 --> 04:38:20,720
Huh?

4778
04:38:20,720 --> 04:38:22,720
You don't mean...

4779
04:38:22,720 --> 04:38:37,720
What's the matter with you?

4780
04:38:37,720 --> 04:38:40,720
I think the Grog may have fallen in love with you, woman.

4781
04:38:40,720 --> 04:38:41,720
What?

4782
04:38:41,720 --> 04:38:43,720
Oh, you can't mean that.

4783
04:38:43,720 --> 04:38:45,720
Please tell me you're not serious.

4784
04:38:45,720 --> 04:38:47,720
It's out of the question.

4785
04:38:47,720 --> 04:38:49,720
It's her ridiculous idea.

4786
04:38:49,720 --> 04:38:51,720
Don't be so silly.

4787
04:39:08,720 --> 04:39:11,720
Where's all that drumming noise coming from?

4788
04:39:11,720 --> 04:39:13,720
From the invisible shroom ice.

4789
04:39:13,720 --> 04:39:16,720
How long before everybody arrives?

4790
04:39:16,720 --> 04:39:19,720
Oh, they're here already, moving all around us.

4791
04:39:19,720 --> 04:39:20,720
They are?

4792
04:39:20,720 --> 04:39:21,720
Where?

4793
04:39:21,720 --> 04:39:22,720
I can't see them.

4794
04:39:22,720 --> 04:39:24,720
Are they really invisible?

4795
04:39:24,720 --> 04:39:29,720
I can't see them either, but I can feel their presence all around me.

4796
04:39:29,720 --> 04:39:32,720
But she's been studying witchcraft, hasn't she?

4797
04:39:32,720 --> 04:39:37,720
I'm sure you and moving will be able to feel their presence quite soon.

4798
04:40:17,720 --> 04:40:18,720
Oh.

4799
04:40:21,720 --> 04:40:25,720
I can see some of them looking all over there.

4800
04:40:34,720 --> 04:40:37,720
I think I see them too, you guys.

4801
04:40:38,720 --> 04:40:40,720
What the hell?

4802
04:40:43,720 --> 04:40:46,720
Food, you tell me, why can't we see all of them?

4803
04:40:46,720 --> 04:40:48,720
Well, we can never see them all.

4804
04:40:48,720 --> 04:40:52,720
I don't understand how did you know earlier all the shroom ice was playing the drums.

4805
04:40:52,720 --> 04:40:56,720
I just know because they sometimes play them in the batch house as well.

4806
04:40:56,720 --> 04:40:58,720
What a wonderful celebration.

4807
04:40:58,720 --> 04:41:03,720
Isn't it lucky I came over here if I had not have missed a most memorable evening?

4808
04:41:08,720 --> 04:41:11,720
What's going on here?

4809
04:41:11,720 --> 04:41:13,720
The grog.

4810
04:41:13,720 --> 04:41:14,720
What?

4811
04:41:16,720 --> 04:41:19,720
What's she going?

4812
04:41:19,720 --> 04:41:23,720
She must be looking for a movement again, I guess.

4813
04:41:23,720 --> 04:41:27,720
No, I think she just wants to warm herself by the fire.

4814
04:41:27,720 --> 04:41:30,720
But what's she doing?

4815
04:41:58,720 --> 04:42:03,720
Well, that's the end of the mid-winter bonfire.

4816
04:42:03,720 --> 04:42:07,720
Poor grog, she freezes everything she touches.

4817
04:42:07,720 --> 04:42:13,720
Whatever she sits on, even the hottest bonfire, turns freezing cold in a matter of seconds.

4818
04:42:13,720 --> 04:42:17,720
Well, at least she's managed to save some of our wood.

4819
04:42:18,720 --> 04:42:20,720
Oh, no.

4820
04:42:26,720 --> 04:42:29,720
Hold on tight now, Snorkemaid, and I'll be careful.

4821
04:42:29,720 --> 04:42:32,720
I can't wait to get into bed.

4822
04:42:32,720 --> 04:42:35,720
I wanted to stay up until the sun came up again.

4823
04:42:35,720 --> 04:42:38,720
But I don't know if I could keep awake till then.

4824
04:42:38,720 --> 04:42:41,720
So long till spring, man, man.

4825
04:42:41,720 --> 04:42:43,720
Goodbye.

4826
04:42:43,720 --> 04:42:46,720
And take care, Alicia.

4827
04:42:46,720 --> 04:42:50,720
I will move in. The moon will light my way back.

4828
04:43:08,720 --> 04:43:10,720
This time the movements have gone too far.

4829
04:43:10,720 --> 04:43:15,720
Something must be done. I'll teach them a lesson they'll never forget.

4830
04:43:16,720 --> 04:43:18,720
They won't get the battle with me.

4831
04:43:20,720 --> 04:43:24,720
Now, what does the witch mean by teach them a lesson?

4832
04:43:24,720 --> 04:43:26,720
That sounds very ominous.

4833
04:43:26,720 --> 04:43:30,720
Let's hope at least that she lets them sleep till next spring.

4834
04:43:37,720 --> 04:43:44,720
They love the laughter and they love the living the movements.

4835
04:43:44,720 --> 04:43:51,720
They're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

4836
04:43:51,720 --> 04:43:55,720
They're always happy and goes at play.

4837
04:43:55,720 --> 04:43:59,720
The movements are having fun day after day.

4838
04:43:59,720 --> 04:44:02,720
The movements.

4839
04:44:02,720 --> 04:44:06,720
The movements.

4840
04:44:06,720 --> 04:44:12,720
The movements.

4841
04:44:14,720 --> 04:44:21,720
The movements.

4842
04:44:36,720 --> 04:44:39,720
Here they are for one and all.

4843
04:44:39,720 --> 04:44:42,720
The movements are about to come.

4844
04:44:42,720 --> 04:44:45,720
They're up down here with me.

4845
04:44:45,720 --> 04:44:48,720
They're up for you on your TV.

4846
04:44:48,720 --> 04:44:51,720
They are the movements.

4847
04:44:51,720 --> 04:44:54,720
They are the movements.

4848
04:44:54,720 --> 04:44:57,720
So come with me, give me your hand.

4849
04:44:57,720 --> 04:45:00,720
I'll take you up to a moment land.

4850
04:45:00,720 --> 04:45:03,720
You can fly just like a bird.

4851
04:45:03,720 --> 04:45:06,720
Sing that song ever.

4852
04:45:06,720 --> 04:45:09,720
There were the movements.

4853
04:45:09,720 --> 04:45:14,720
There were the movements.

4854
04:45:14,720 --> 04:45:18,720
There were the movements.

4855
04:45:18,720 --> 04:45:20,720
There were the movements.

4856
04:45:39,720 --> 04:46:09,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

4857
04:46:09,720 --> 04:46:38,860
heh heh heh, heh heh, heh heh heh heh heh, heh heh, heh heh, heh heh.. The witch has come to Murman Valley..

4858
04:46:38,860 --> 04:46:40,860
Could you be up to this time?

4859
04:46:40,860 --> 04:47:01,860
Eldritch Cabalazum!

4860
04:47:01,860 --> 04:47:03,860
Oh, it's snowing again.

4861
04:47:03,860 --> 04:47:05,860
I must get a covered brown.

4862
04:47:08,860 --> 04:47:36,860
The great thaw had come at last.

4863
04:47:36,860 --> 04:47:48,860
The movement valley.

4864
04:47:48,860 --> 04:47:53,860
I think I can smell spring.

4865
04:47:53,860 --> 04:48:04,860
Oh, I've never seen anything like this one before.

4866
04:48:04,860 --> 04:48:06,860
Hello there, Mr. Hemielun.

4867
04:48:06,860 --> 04:48:08,860
Hello, Sniff. You're up early this year?

4868
04:48:08,860 --> 04:48:12,860
Yes. I think I've even beat Momen to it.

4869
04:48:12,860 --> 04:48:22,860
Is that so? Why are the moments so late this year?

4870
04:48:22,860 --> 04:48:27,860
Momen, wake up! Spring is here! It's time to wake up!

4871
04:48:28,860 --> 04:48:31,860
Maybe Snork Maiden's easier to wake up.

4872
04:48:31,860 --> 04:48:34,860
Snork Maiden!

4873
04:48:34,860 --> 04:48:39,860
And I thought I was difficult to wake up. I must get closer.

4874
04:48:49,860 --> 04:48:51,860
What are you doing, Sniff?

4875
04:48:51,860 --> 04:48:53,860
What am I doing? You can see, can't you?

4876
04:48:53,860 --> 04:48:55,860
Of course I can, but why are you climbing up that?

4877
04:48:55,860 --> 04:48:57,860
Momen and Snork Maiden are still asleep.

4878
04:48:57,860 --> 04:48:58,860
I have to wake them up.

4879
04:48:58,860 --> 04:49:02,860
Why don't you go this way? It's easier.

4880
04:49:02,860 --> 04:49:11,860
What do I do now?

4881
04:49:11,860 --> 04:49:19,860
Funny, even Momen still asleep.

4882
04:49:19,860 --> 04:49:23,860
Wrong room.

4883
04:49:23,860 --> 04:49:33,860
Come on, wake up, lazy bones.

4884
04:49:33,860 --> 04:49:37,860
Momen, spring has come.

4885
04:49:37,860 --> 04:49:40,860
Well, look at that. Wake up, you sleepyhead.

4886
04:49:40,860 --> 04:49:43,860
Oh, you really are impossible.

4887
04:49:43,860 --> 04:49:49,860
Momen, Momen, Momen! This is odd, even for Momen.

4888
04:49:49,860 --> 04:49:52,860
Open the window, little Mai!

4889
04:49:53,860 --> 04:50:02,860
Oh, was I scared?

4890
04:50:02,860 --> 04:50:04,860
Oh, I haven't you opened them up.

4891
04:50:04,860 --> 04:50:07,860
I've tried, but they won't.

4892
04:50:07,860 --> 04:50:11,860
You're kidding.

4893
04:50:11,860 --> 04:50:14,860
No one can resist this little Mai.

4894
04:50:14,860 --> 04:50:18,860
Wake up, old man. I know you're ticklish.

4895
04:50:19,860 --> 04:50:23,860
Momen, Momen!

4896
04:50:23,860 --> 04:50:25,860
I told you so.

4897
04:50:27,860 --> 04:50:31,860
Momen, come on!

4898
04:50:33,860 --> 04:50:35,860
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

4899
04:50:35,860 --> 04:50:36,860
Ah, ah, ah!

4900
04:50:36,860 --> 04:50:41,860
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

4901
04:50:41,860 --> 04:50:44,860
How strange!

4902
04:50:44,860 --> 04:50:45,860
How sad!

4903
04:50:45,860 --> 04:50:47,060
Eh? What do you mean?

4904
04:50:47,060 --> 04:50:48,380
I think...

4905
04:50:48,380 --> 04:50:50,060
Well, you don't think...

4906
04:50:50,060 --> 04:50:51,580
You don't think that...

4907
04:50:51,580 --> 04:50:52,660
It's hard to tell.

4908
04:50:52,660 --> 04:50:54,420
I was listening for his heartbeat.

4909
04:50:56,660 --> 04:50:58,060
He's still breathing.

4910
04:50:59,660 --> 04:51:01,060
And snort-baited?

4911
04:51:02,980 --> 04:51:06,060
Wake up, you slug-up ass!

4912
04:51:06,060 --> 04:51:08,060
Snort-baited!

4913
04:51:08,460 --> 04:51:09,860
They won't wake up.

4914
04:51:10,660 --> 04:51:11,860
This is strange.

4915
04:51:11,860 --> 04:51:13,260
Why don't we go and try the other?

4916
04:51:13,260 --> 04:51:14,660
Yes, why not?

4917
04:51:14,660 --> 04:51:17,460
I hate it when others are asleep while I'm up.

4918
04:51:17,460 --> 04:51:20,060
But then I don't like it much the other way around either.

4919
04:51:20,060 --> 04:51:21,060
Do I sniff?

4920
04:51:24,860 --> 04:51:26,660
Moment pop up, please wake up!

4921
04:51:26,660 --> 04:51:29,060
We've tried to wake up moment, but he won't!

4922
04:51:29,060 --> 04:51:31,260
Wakey-moomin' mama breakfast time!

4923
04:51:31,260 --> 04:51:32,860
Come on, moment pop up!

4924
04:51:32,860 --> 04:51:33,860
Wake up!

4925
04:51:35,460 --> 04:51:37,060
This is no use!

4926
04:51:44,860 --> 04:51:48,060
Goodness, it seems the moomin's are still hibernating.

4927
04:51:48,060 --> 04:51:50,060
And so it's snort-baiting.

4928
04:51:50,060 --> 04:51:53,060
That's odd, she always wakes up even before me.

4929
04:51:53,060 --> 04:51:56,660
Oh, moment two, but this year it seems to be different!

4930
04:51:56,660 --> 04:51:59,860
I'll go back home, and I'll come over again in a little while

4931
04:51:59,860 --> 04:52:02,060
when the moomin' family will have woken up.

4932
04:52:02,060 --> 04:52:03,460
If they ever do.

4933
04:52:03,460 --> 04:52:04,460
Huh?

4934
04:52:04,460 --> 04:52:07,460
We've tried everything to wake them up short of buckets of water

4935
04:52:07,460 --> 04:52:09,060
and there's no moving them.

4936
04:52:09,060 --> 04:52:12,260
We've shouted and shook and pinched and tickled and stopped!

4937
04:52:12,260 --> 04:52:13,460
Oh, dear!

4938
04:52:13,460 --> 04:52:15,860
It's not just strange, it's ominous!

4939
04:52:15,860 --> 04:52:17,860
Oh, my, surely not.

4940
04:52:18,860 --> 04:52:20,660
Hello, everybody!

4941
04:52:21,660 --> 04:52:23,460
How is everyone?

4942
04:52:23,460 --> 04:52:24,260
What is it?

4943
04:52:24,260 --> 04:52:26,060
You all look very scared.

4944
04:52:27,460 --> 04:52:28,860
Huh?

4945
04:52:28,860 --> 04:52:30,860
Still hibernating?

4946
04:52:35,060 --> 04:52:37,460
It's all very strange, have you lint?

4947
04:52:39,060 --> 04:52:40,260
Moment!

4948
04:52:41,460 --> 04:52:42,260
See?

4949
04:52:42,260 --> 04:52:43,860
Yes, indeed!

4950
04:52:46,260 --> 04:52:48,460
How we can really do is wait and see.

4951
04:52:48,460 --> 04:52:50,060
I suppose you're right.

4952
04:52:50,060 --> 04:52:53,460
Don't worry, the days are getting longer all the time now.

4953
04:52:53,460 --> 04:52:55,860
So the moomin's can't sleep much longer.

4954
04:52:55,860 --> 04:52:57,860
And snort-baiting?

4955
04:52:57,860 --> 04:52:59,860
Cheat-tool, of course.

4956
04:53:00,460 --> 04:53:03,260
Bet you anything, moment wakes up when Snuffkin returns.

4957
04:53:03,260 --> 04:53:05,260
I think you're right, Sniff.

4958
04:53:06,260 --> 04:53:09,860
And then, one day about a week later,

4959
04:53:09,860 --> 04:53:13,460
Snuffkin did come back from his yearly trip south.

4960
04:53:44,260 --> 04:53:45,260
Snuffkin!

4961
04:53:46,860 --> 04:53:47,860
Snuffkin!

4962
04:53:52,660 --> 04:53:54,260
Snuffkin!

4963
04:54:14,060 --> 04:54:16,060
Snuffkin!

4964
04:54:17,060 --> 04:54:18,460
Where's the moomin'?

4965
04:54:18,460 --> 04:54:19,660
He's in bad.

4966
04:54:19,660 --> 04:54:21,660
Moomin' still asleep.

4967
04:54:22,460 --> 04:54:23,660
A sleep?

4968
04:54:32,260 --> 04:54:34,660
They won't wake up no matter what you do.

4969
04:54:35,860 --> 04:54:37,860
What do you think, Snuffkin?

4970
04:54:37,860 --> 04:54:39,660
I think they're very sick.

4971
04:54:39,660 --> 04:54:41,460
That's a possibility.

4972
04:54:41,460 --> 04:54:43,260
Sleeping sickness, perhaps?

4973
04:54:43,260 --> 04:54:45,460
It's very difficult to say.

4974
04:54:45,460 --> 04:54:47,460
To me, though, if you want my honest opinion,

4975
04:54:47,460 --> 04:54:50,460
I think somebody has cast a very nasty spell on them.

4976
04:54:51,460 --> 04:54:52,660
A spell?

4977
04:54:52,660 --> 04:54:54,460
But who would do that?

4978
04:54:54,460 --> 04:54:56,060
I think I know.

4979
04:54:56,060 --> 04:54:57,060
Huh?

4980
04:54:57,060 --> 04:54:58,660
Are you mean the witch?

4981
04:54:58,660 --> 04:55:00,860
Alice is grandmother, but why?

4982
04:55:00,860 --> 04:55:03,460
To tell you the truth, I haven't the biggest idea.

4983
04:55:03,460 --> 04:55:05,460
How do we find out?

4984
04:55:07,260 --> 04:55:09,260
I'll go to the forest and see her.

4985
04:55:09,260 --> 04:55:12,260
And if she did cast a spell, do you think she'd tell you?

4986
04:55:12,260 --> 04:55:14,860
I really don't know, but we have to do something.

4987
04:55:14,860 --> 04:55:17,660
We can't just leave them sleeping here forever.

4988
04:55:18,860 --> 04:55:20,260
I'll go with you.

4989
04:55:20,260 --> 04:55:23,460
I guess I'd better stay here to take care of things.

4990
04:55:23,460 --> 04:55:26,460
Well, if they suddenly wake up, somebody needs to be here.

4991
04:55:27,660 --> 04:55:29,260
Snuffkin...

4992
04:55:29,260 --> 04:55:29,860
Huh?

4993
04:55:29,860 --> 04:55:31,060
That's him!

4994
04:55:31,060 --> 04:55:32,060
At last!

4995
04:55:32,060 --> 04:55:33,060
Moomin'!

4996
04:55:33,060 --> 04:55:34,260
Moomin'!

4997
04:55:34,260 --> 04:55:35,260
Moomin'!

4998
04:55:37,260 --> 04:55:38,860
He's dreaming.

4999
04:55:38,860 --> 04:55:41,460
Just looking at him makes me feel sleepy.

5000
04:55:43,260 --> 04:55:44,260
Moomin'!

5001
04:55:44,260 --> 04:55:47,260
I promise to get this horrible spell cast off for you.

5002
04:56:13,260 --> 04:56:14,260
Hush!

5003
04:56:18,260 --> 04:56:20,260
Where are you going?

5004
04:56:20,260 --> 04:56:24,260
I've done all the chores, even washed out your old potion jars.

5005
04:56:24,260 --> 04:56:26,260
So, where are you going?

5006
04:56:26,260 --> 04:56:27,260
Spring is here, Grandma.

5007
04:56:27,260 --> 04:56:30,260
I thought I'd take some time off to celebrate.

5008
04:56:30,260 --> 04:56:32,260
But what about your work?

5009
04:56:32,260 --> 04:56:35,260
I'm just going out for the day, Grandma.

5010
04:56:35,260 --> 04:56:37,260
And I know where.

5011
04:56:37,260 --> 04:56:40,260
I only want to know where you're going.

5012
04:56:40,260 --> 04:56:42,260
And I know where.

5013
04:56:42,260 --> 04:56:44,260
I only want to see the Moomin's.

5014
04:56:44,260 --> 04:56:46,260
They're still hibernating.

5015
04:56:46,260 --> 04:56:48,260
No, they're not. It isn't winter anymore.

5016
04:56:48,260 --> 04:56:52,260
Winter or spring, I happen to know the Moomin's are still asleep.

5017
04:56:52,260 --> 04:56:55,260
How could you know what the Moomin's are up to, Grandma?

5018
04:56:55,260 --> 04:56:56,260
Hm.

5019
04:56:56,260 --> 04:56:58,260
Oh, which is no everything, my dear girl.

5020
04:56:58,260 --> 04:56:59,260
Really?

5021
04:56:59,260 --> 04:57:01,260
Well, I'll go and see.

5022
04:57:01,260 --> 04:57:03,260
Come here!

5023
04:57:04,260 --> 04:57:14,260
I have to admit that I can't help being worried about the Moomin's.

5024
04:57:14,260 --> 04:57:17,260
Their windows are open for the spring.

5025
04:57:17,260 --> 04:57:20,260
So they can smell the first spring flowers.

5026
04:57:20,260 --> 04:57:23,260
Well, I suppose I'd miss beginning on.

5027
04:57:28,260 --> 04:57:31,260
Why didn't you tell them about the witch in the spell?

5028
04:57:31,260 --> 04:57:34,260
Well, after all, that was just an idea, I got.

5029
04:57:34,260 --> 04:57:36,260
Ideas can be embarrassing if you were wrong,

5030
04:57:36,260 --> 04:57:39,260
so don't tell anyone for the time being.

5031
04:57:39,260 --> 04:57:40,260
All right.

5032
04:57:40,260 --> 04:57:41,260
I'm going.

5033
04:57:43,260 --> 04:57:45,260
And I'm leaving, too.

5034
04:57:45,260 --> 04:57:46,260
Okay.

5035
04:57:52,260 --> 04:57:54,260
There's Alicia.

5036
04:57:54,260 --> 04:57:57,260
Hi, everyone. It's me.

5037
04:57:57,260 --> 04:57:59,260
Why do you get a teller?

5038
04:57:59,260 --> 04:58:02,260
I can't live the truth, I guess.

5039
04:58:08,260 --> 04:58:11,260
The best thing would be for me to talk to her first.

5040
04:58:11,260 --> 04:58:12,260
Yes, I agree.

5041
04:58:12,260 --> 04:58:15,260
She's unbelievable. How could she?

5042
04:58:18,260 --> 04:58:21,260
I can hardly believe you could be so mean, Grandma.

5043
04:58:21,260 --> 04:58:23,260
Calm down, my dear.

5044
04:58:23,260 --> 04:58:26,260
Why, I did it all for you, Alicia.

5045
04:58:26,260 --> 04:58:28,260
You did it for me.

5046
04:58:28,260 --> 04:58:30,260
The moments are asleep. Why should you go there?

5047
04:58:30,260 --> 04:58:32,260
Do them a world of good, too, along sleep.

5048
04:58:32,260 --> 04:58:34,260
How ridiculous, Grandma!

5049
04:58:34,260 --> 04:58:37,260
Alicia, you've done quite well in your studies, and if you keep at it,

5050
04:58:37,260 --> 04:58:42,260
I see no reason why you shouldn't be a fully fledged witch before 30.

5051
04:58:42,260 --> 04:58:46,260
And if I do see the moments, I won't be a witch till I'm 31.

5052
04:58:46,260 --> 04:58:47,260
Is that what you mean?

5053
04:58:47,260 --> 04:58:50,260
Now, the moments are very bad, and the ones on you.

5054
04:58:50,260 --> 04:58:53,260
They are so disgustingly good, and if you want to be a witch,

5055
04:58:53,260 --> 04:58:55,260
you mustn't see them.

5056
04:58:56,260 --> 04:58:57,260
Hmm.

5057
04:58:59,260 --> 04:59:02,260
And if I promise never to go near Moomin Valley again,

5058
04:59:02,260 --> 04:59:04,260
will you lift the spell, Grandma?

5059
04:59:04,260 --> 04:59:07,260
Good girl, that's exactly what I wanted here.

5060
04:59:07,260 --> 04:59:09,260
You promise me, Dan, Alicia?

5061
04:59:09,260 --> 04:59:10,260
I promise, Grandma.

5062
04:59:10,260 --> 04:59:12,260
Right. The spell should be lifted.

5063
04:59:12,260 --> 04:59:13,260
Snuff guard.

5064
04:59:13,260 --> 04:59:14,260
What do you want?

5065
04:59:14,260 --> 04:59:18,260
There are two different ways of lifting the spell I cast on the moments.

5066
04:59:18,260 --> 04:59:19,260
Uh-huh.

5067
04:59:19,260 --> 04:59:22,260
The first one is that I go to Moomin Valley myself and chant the magic words

5068
04:59:22,260 --> 04:59:24,260
outside their bedroom window.

5069
04:59:24,260 --> 04:59:27,260
Oh, Grandma, that's not a good idea.

5070
04:59:27,260 --> 04:59:32,260
Oh, oh, you mean people might be upset about me casting a spell on the moments?

5071
04:59:32,260 --> 04:59:33,260
You may be right.

5072
04:59:33,260 --> 04:59:38,260
So therefore, Snuff Kid, I have no choice but to ask you to perform the task.

5073
04:59:38,260 --> 04:59:40,260
Oh, but why me?

5074
04:59:40,260 --> 04:59:42,260
You do have your harmonica with you?

5075
04:59:42,260 --> 04:59:43,260
Of course.

5076
04:59:43,260 --> 04:59:44,260
Let me have it, please.

5077
04:59:48,260 --> 04:59:50,260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

5078
04:59:50,260 --> 04:59:51,260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

5079
04:59:51,260 --> 04:59:52,260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

5080
04:59:52,260 --> 04:59:53,260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

5081
04:59:53,260 --> 04:59:54,260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

5082
04:59:54,260 --> 04:59:59,260
If you don't stop staring at me, my witchcraft won't be effective.

5083
04:59:59,260 --> 05:00:02,260
Alicia, get me the next potion now.

5084
05:00:02,260 --> 05:00:03,260
Oh.

5085
05:00:03,260 --> 05:00:04,260
Oh.

5086
05:00:04,260 --> 05:00:06,260
All right, grandmother.

5087
05:00:10,260 --> 05:00:11,260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

5088
05:00:11,260 --> 05:00:12,260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

5089
05:00:12,260 --> 05:00:13,260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

5090
05:00:13,260 --> 05:00:14,260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

5091
05:00:14,260 --> 05:00:16,260
So she can't do it if we look at her, huh?

5092
05:00:16,260 --> 05:00:17,260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

5093
05:00:17,260 --> 05:00:18,260
Eldridge Cabalasum.

5094
05:00:18,260 --> 05:00:20,260
Now, listen, Inspector.

5095
05:00:20,260 --> 05:00:21,260
You must do something.

5096
05:00:21,260 --> 05:00:23,260
You are the police, aren't you?

5097
05:00:23,260 --> 05:00:28,260
Well, I have to tell you, waking people up is not really part of our job.

5098
05:00:28,260 --> 05:00:30,260
But you're our last hope, Inspector.

5099
05:00:30,260 --> 05:00:31,260
You must do something.

5100
05:00:31,260 --> 05:00:35,260
Perhaps if you could possibly use your whistle to wake them up.

5101
05:00:35,260 --> 05:00:36,260
Uh-huh.

5102
05:00:36,260 --> 05:00:37,260
It's very shrill indoors.

5103
05:00:37,260 --> 05:00:38,260
Good frighten them.

5104
05:00:38,260 --> 05:00:39,260
And fire your revolver.

5105
05:00:39,260 --> 05:00:41,260
I'm sure that would do it, Inspector.

5106
05:00:41,260 --> 05:00:43,260
Oh, I don't carry guns.

5107
05:00:43,260 --> 05:00:44,260
They're dangerous.

5108
05:00:45,260 --> 05:00:46,260
Oh, no.

5109
05:00:52,260 --> 05:00:54,260
Hey, Snuffkin!

5110
05:00:54,260 --> 05:00:56,260
Little Y!

5111
05:00:56,260 --> 05:00:57,260
He sounds worried.

5112
05:00:57,260 --> 05:00:59,260
I bet they're still fast asleep.

5113
05:00:59,260 --> 05:01:00,260
Hmm.

5114
05:01:03,260 --> 05:01:05,260
Right, Snuffkin?

5115
05:01:05,260 --> 05:01:06,260
Get on with it.

5116
05:01:15,260 --> 05:01:16,260
No.

5117
05:01:16,260 --> 05:01:18,260
No.

5118
05:01:24,260 --> 05:01:25,260
Hmm.

5119
05:01:25,260 --> 05:01:26,260
It's not working, is it?

5120
05:01:26,260 --> 05:01:28,260
Get my chance, Snuff.

5121
05:01:36,260 --> 05:01:37,260
No.

5122
05:01:37,260 --> 05:01:40,260
Snuffkin!

5123
05:01:40,260 --> 05:01:41,260
Snorkemaedun!

5124
05:01:41,260 --> 05:01:42,260
Wake up!

5125
05:01:42,260 --> 05:01:43,260
Sprang is here!

5126
05:01:43,260 --> 05:01:44,260
Here, come on!

5127
05:01:44,260 --> 05:01:45,260
Ah!

5128
05:01:45,260 --> 05:01:46,260
Hmm.

5129
05:01:46,260 --> 05:01:47,260
Hmm.

5130
05:01:47,260 --> 05:01:48,260
Hmm.

5131
05:01:48,260 --> 05:01:49,260
Hmm.

5132
05:01:49,260 --> 05:01:50,260
Hmm.

5133
05:01:50,260 --> 05:01:51,260
Hmm.

5134
05:01:51,260 --> 05:01:52,260
Hmm.

5135
05:01:52,260 --> 05:01:56,260
Oh, spring is here already.

5136
05:01:56,260 --> 05:01:58,260
Good morning, Papa Deer.

5137
05:01:58,260 --> 05:01:59,260
Hmm.

5138
05:01:59,260 --> 05:02:00,260
Good morning.

5139
05:02:00,260 --> 05:02:02,260
I have a feeling we've over-slaped.

5140
05:02:02,260 --> 05:02:04,260
I wonder whether the others are up yet.

5141
05:02:04,260 --> 05:02:05,260
Hmm.

5142
05:02:05,260 --> 05:02:08,260
Oh, she's made a fool of you, Snuffkin.

5143
05:02:08,260 --> 05:02:09,260
I'm shot up, Snuff!

5144
05:02:09,260 --> 05:02:12,260
Maybe she forgot how to cast off the spell.

5145
05:02:13,260 --> 05:02:14,260
Hi, Snuffkin!

5146
05:02:14,260 --> 05:02:15,260
Hi!

5147
05:02:15,260 --> 05:02:16,260
Ah!

5148
05:02:16,260 --> 05:02:17,260
Morning!

5149
05:02:18,260 --> 05:02:20,260
Morning, everybody!

5150
05:02:20,260 --> 05:02:22,260
Hi, Snuffkin!

5151
05:02:24,260 --> 05:02:28,260
I'm so glad you've arrived back already, Snuffkin.

5152
05:02:28,260 --> 05:02:29,260
Yes.

5153
05:02:29,260 --> 05:02:31,260
You woke up early, too.

5154
05:02:31,260 --> 05:02:33,260
Did you hear that?

5155
05:02:33,260 --> 05:02:35,260
It's you that woke up late, Booman.

5156
05:02:35,260 --> 05:02:37,260
Who me?

5157
05:02:37,260 --> 05:02:38,260
Hmm.

5158
05:02:38,260 --> 05:02:39,260
Ah.

5159
05:02:39,260 --> 05:02:47,260
Now I say, Moomans are ready up and about!

5160
05:02:47,260 --> 05:02:48,260
What?

5161
05:02:48,260 --> 05:02:50,260
I snored!

5162
05:02:50,260 --> 05:02:52,260
Oh, it's you, you're awake.

5163
05:02:52,260 --> 05:02:54,260
I'm glad I didn't blow my whistle.

5164
05:02:54,260 --> 05:02:56,260
But we did have a reason to be worried, Inspector.

5165
05:02:56,260 --> 05:02:57,260
He's right.

5166
05:02:57,260 --> 05:02:59,260
What about Moom and Mama?

5167
05:02:59,260 --> 05:03:00,260
And Moom and Papa?

5168
05:03:00,260 --> 05:03:02,260
Oh, there, everybody.

5169
05:03:02,260 --> 05:03:04,260
Is anything the matter?

5170
05:03:04,260 --> 05:03:05,260
Nothing at all.

5171
05:03:05,260 --> 05:03:06,260
They're awake.

5172
05:03:06,260 --> 05:03:07,260
Oh, there.

5173
05:03:07,260 --> 05:03:08,260
I don't understand.

5174
05:03:08,260 --> 05:03:10,260
You don't understand words.

5175
05:03:10,260 --> 05:03:13,260
We were very worried because you just wouldn't wake up.

5176
05:03:13,260 --> 05:03:14,260
Oh, really?

5177
05:03:14,260 --> 05:03:16,260
You do know we always have a night, don't you?

5178
05:03:16,260 --> 05:03:18,260
We sleep all winter and we always wake up in this room.

5179
05:03:18,260 --> 05:03:22,260
Of course, of course, but this year, start your telling.

5180
05:03:22,260 --> 05:03:23,260
Right.

5181
05:03:23,260 --> 05:03:24,260
Well, we did have a bit of a problem.

5182
05:03:24,260 --> 05:03:27,260
You see, Moom and Papa, we couldn't snuffkin.

5183
05:03:27,260 --> 05:03:29,260
You're back already, yes?

5184
05:03:29,260 --> 05:03:31,260
Why don't you listen to us, Moom and Papa?

5185
05:03:31,260 --> 05:03:32,260
Very well.

5186
05:03:32,260 --> 05:03:33,260
Very well.

5187
05:03:33,260 --> 05:03:36,260
Why don't you all come in and we'll have a nice cup of tea.

5188
05:03:36,260 --> 05:03:39,260
And we can discuss your problem properly.

5189
05:03:39,260 --> 05:03:42,260
But it's your problem, I'm afraid, not ours.

5190
05:03:42,260 --> 05:03:43,260
What does he mean?

5191
05:03:43,260 --> 05:03:45,260
We don't have a problem, do we?

5192
05:03:45,260 --> 05:03:48,260
Please do come in anyway, everybody.

5193
05:03:48,260 --> 05:03:49,260
Please.

5194
05:03:49,260 --> 05:03:50,260
You too.

5195
05:03:50,260 --> 05:03:51,260
All of you, come in.

5196
05:03:51,260 --> 05:03:53,260
Come in, everybody.

5197
05:03:55,260 --> 05:03:56,260
I'm on the side.

5198
05:03:56,260 --> 05:03:57,260
I'm in Georgia.

5199
05:04:02,260 --> 05:04:08,260
Whatever happened to us this year.

5200
05:04:08,260 --> 05:04:09,260
Hey, snuffkin.

5201
05:04:15,260 --> 05:04:16,260
Alicia!

5202
05:04:16,260 --> 05:04:17,260
Alicia!

5203
05:04:22,260 --> 05:04:24,260
Oh, my man!

5204
05:04:24,260 --> 05:04:26,260
We've come to see you, Alicia.

5205
05:04:26,260 --> 05:04:28,260
That was nice of you.

5206
05:04:28,260 --> 05:04:31,260
Your grandmother isn't home, is she?

5207
05:04:31,260 --> 05:04:32,260
No.

5208
05:04:32,260 --> 05:04:34,260
Then we can play hide and seek.

5209
05:04:34,260 --> 05:04:35,260
I can't.

5210
05:04:35,260 --> 05:04:37,260
I promised grandma there.

5211
05:04:37,260 --> 05:04:38,260
Yes, I know.

5212
05:04:38,260 --> 05:04:39,260
Snuffkin told me.

5213
05:04:39,260 --> 05:04:41,260
That was a really great thing to do.

5214
05:04:41,260 --> 05:04:43,260
But you didn't promise not to see us.

5215
05:04:43,260 --> 05:04:46,260
You just promised not to go to Moom and Valley, didn't you?

5216
05:04:46,260 --> 05:04:47,260
Yeah.

5217
05:04:47,260 --> 05:04:50,260
And listen, you never promised not to play with us either, did you?

5218
05:04:50,260 --> 05:04:51,260
No.

5219
05:04:51,260 --> 05:04:55,260
So, if we came here to see you instead of you to us, then it's all right.

5220
05:04:55,260 --> 05:04:57,260
And you don't have to break your promise.

5221
05:04:57,260 --> 05:04:59,260
Oh, I suppose so.

5222
05:04:59,260 --> 05:05:01,260
Yes, I suppose you're right.

5223
05:05:01,260 --> 05:05:03,260
Well, let's play.

5224
05:05:03,260 --> 05:05:04,260
Yeah.

5225
05:05:04,260 --> 05:05:12,260
13, 4, 3, 5, 8.

5226
05:05:12,260 --> 05:05:19,260
Oh!

5227
05:05:19,260 --> 05:05:30,260
That afternoon, they all had the most wonderful time playing hide and seek in the woods.

5228
05:05:30,260 --> 05:05:32,260
Ha ha ha ha ha!

5229
05:05:32,260 --> 05:05:33,260
Hi!

5230
05:05:33,260 --> 05:05:34,260
Jule!

5231
05:05:34,260 --> 05:05:35,260
Three!

5232
05:05:35,260 --> 05:05:37,260
Your teeth are!

5233
05:05:37,260 --> 05:05:38,260
Five!

5234
05:05:38,260 --> 05:05:39,260
Six!

5235
05:05:39,260 --> 05:05:40,260
Seven!

5236
05:05:40,260 --> 05:05:41,260
Ha ha ha ha!

5237
05:05:41,260 --> 05:05:42,260
Nine!

5238
05:05:42,260 --> 05:05:43,260
Ten!

5239
05:05:43,260 --> 05:05:44,260
Eleven!

5240
05:05:44,260 --> 05:05:45,260
One!

5241
05:05:45,260 --> 05:05:49,260
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

5242
05:05:49,260 --> 05:06:11,260
We're leaving and sharing and caring and giving the movements.

5243
05:06:11,260 --> 05:06:15,260
They're always happy and goes at play.

5244
05:06:15,260 --> 05:06:19,260
The movements are having fun day after day.

5245
05:06:19,260 --> 05:06:22,260
The movements.

5246
05:06:22,260 --> 05:06:25,260
The movements.

5247
05:06:25,260 --> 05:06:32,260
The movements.

5248
05:06:45,260 --> 05:06:57,260
Here they are for one and all.

5249
05:06:57,260 --> 05:07:00,260
The movements are about to come.

5250
05:07:00,260 --> 05:07:03,260
Come on and sit down here with me.

5251
05:07:03,260 --> 05:07:06,260
They're here for you on your TV.

5252
05:07:06,260 --> 05:07:09,260
They are the movements.

5253
05:07:09,260 --> 05:07:12,260
They are the movements.

5254
05:07:12,260 --> 05:07:15,260
So come with me, give me your hand.

5255
05:07:15,260 --> 05:07:18,260
I'll take you up to a movement land.

5256
05:07:18,260 --> 05:07:21,260
You can fly just like a bird.

5257
05:07:21,260 --> 05:07:23,260
Sing that song ever.

5258
05:07:23,260 --> 05:07:26,260
There were the movements.

5259
05:07:26,260 --> 05:07:29,260
There were the movements.

5260
05:07:29,260 --> 05:07:32,260
There were the movements.

5261
05:07:32,260 --> 05:07:35,260
There were the movements.

5262
05:07:35,260 --> 05:07:38,260
There were the movements.

5263
05:07:38,260 --> 05:07:41,260
There were the movements.

5264
05:07:41,260 --> 05:07:44,260
There were the movements.

5265
05:07:44,260 --> 05:07:47,260
There were the movements.

5266
05:07:47,260 --> 05:07:50,260
There were the movements.

5267
05:07:50,260 --> 05:07:53,260
What?

5268
05:07:53,260 --> 05:07:55,260
What?

5269
05:07:55,260 --> 05:07:57,260
What?

5270
05:07:57,260 --> 05:08:02,260
Big explosions could be heard in Woman Valley almost every night.

5271
05:08:02,260 --> 05:08:04,260
And women couldn't sleep a wink.

5272
05:08:04,260 --> 05:08:08,260
Usually there was just one, but sometimes even two.

5273
05:08:09,260 --> 05:08:13,260
You heard it too, Mom and Papa.

5274
05:08:13,260 --> 05:08:16,260
Yes, those loud bangs are keeping me awake.

5275
05:08:16,260 --> 05:08:21,260
I wonder if there'll be another one.

5276
05:08:21,260 --> 05:08:24,260
They seem to be coming from the north.

5277
05:08:24,260 --> 05:08:26,260
Hmm, he starts out.

5278
05:08:26,260 --> 05:08:28,260
Or they could be coming from lonely mountains.

5279
05:08:28,260 --> 05:08:31,260
If you ask me, I believe they're the work of the witch.

5280
05:08:31,260 --> 05:08:32,260
The witch?

5281
05:08:32,260 --> 05:08:34,260
But witches don't make a lot of noise.

5282
05:08:35,260 --> 05:08:38,260
You never know. They're sneaky characters.

5283
05:08:38,260 --> 05:08:41,260
Tomorrow I'll have a few words with the inspector.

5284
05:08:41,260 --> 05:08:43,260
It's up to him to put a stop to it.

5285
05:08:43,260 --> 05:08:46,260
Papa, why would the witch want to make explosions?

5286
05:08:46,260 --> 05:08:47,260
Why not?

5287
05:08:47,260 --> 05:08:51,260
The first bang wakes me up and then I lie awake waiting for the second one,

5288
05:08:51,260 --> 05:08:53,260
which might not come at all.

5289
05:08:53,260 --> 05:08:55,260
The bangs might not come from Woman Valley at all,

5290
05:08:55,260 --> 05:08:58,260
and they might be just an echo of the mountains.

5291
05:08:58,260 --> 05:08:59,260
You think so?

5292
05:08:59,260 --> 05:09:00,260
Yes, I do.

5293
05:09:00,260 --> 05:09:02,260
Well, at least that's what Snuffkin thinks.

5294
05:09:02,260 --> 05:09:04,260
Explosions might come from the sea.

5295
05:09:04,260 --> 05:09:05,260
That's what Snuffkin figured.

5296
05:09:05,260 --> 05:09:09,260
He thought it might be pirates or something making the noises.

5297
05:09:09,260 --> 05:09:12,260
He's already had pirates and they went a long time ago.

5298
05:09:12,260 --> 05:09:15,260
I'm plumping for the witch. There's no doubt in my mouth.

5299
05:09:15,260 --> 05:09:17,260
Goodness, what are you doing out here?

5300
05:09:17,260 --> 05:09:19,260
We're waiting for another explosion, Mama.

5301
05:09:19,260 --> 05:09:21,260
You'll wait in vain, dear.

5302
05:09:21,260 --> 05:09:23,260
You know that moment, Mama.

5303
05:09:23,260 --> 05:09:25,260
Well, we had two explosions last night,

5304
05:09:25,260 --> 05:09:29,260
and we've never had double explosions for two nights in a row.

5305
05:09:29,260 --> 05:09:31,260
Until now, that is.

5306
05:09:31,260 --> 05:09:34,260
You heard that. It clearly came from over there.

5307
05:09:34,260 --> 05:09:35,260
Over there?

5308
05:09:35,260 --> 05:09:38,260
Oh, no. It certainly came from over there.

5309
05:09:38,260 --> 05:09:41,260
You couldn't mistake it. I'm sure of it.

5310
05:09:54,260 --> 05:09:56,260
Good morning, Moomin, lovely day.

5311
05:09:56,260 --> 05:09:57,260
Good morning, Snuffkin.

5312
05:09:57,260 --> 05:09:58,260
You look very sleepy.

5313
05:09:58,260 --> 05:10:02,260
So would you be opposed to explosions that kept you awake for most of the night?

5314
05:10:02,260 --> 05:10:05,260
Those explosions are really very odd, aren't they?

5315
05:10:05,260 --> 05:10:09,260
They certainly are. Would you come with me and have a word with the witch?

5316
05:10:09,260 --> 05:10:13,260
Moomin, Papa's convinced that she's the one who's making the bangs.

5317
05:10:13,260 --> 05:10:14,260
I think he's wrong there.

5318
05:10:14,260 --> 05:10:18,260
That's what I thought, but there's nothing I could say to convince him.

5319
05:10:18,260 --> 05:10:21,260
So now I'm going to find out for myself.

5320
05:10:21,260 --> 05:10:25,260
You can certainly ask her, but do you really trust a witch to tell you the truth?

5321
05:10:26,260 --> 05:10:28,260
Do you, Moomin?

5322
05:10:28,260 --> 05:10:31,260
But witches don't have to lie, Shirley.

5323
05:10:39,260 --> 05:10:41,260
Is that you, Little My?

5324
05:10:43,260 --> 05:10:45,260
And where are you two going?

5325
05:10:45,260 --> 05:10:46,260
Little My.

5326
05:10:46,260 --> 05:10:48,260
Are you tailing me full-time or what?

5327
05:10:48,260 --> 05:10:51,260
Yes, whenever you're sneaking off somewhere.

5328
05:10:51,260 --> 05:10:53,260
I'm not sneaking. I'm just walking.

5329
05:10:54,260 --> 05:10:57,260
Well, I've never seen anyone walking in such a sneaky way.

5330
05:11:02,260 --> 05:11:06,260
Last time the witch tried to keep you from waking up, didn't she?

5331
05:11:06,260 --> 05:11:10,260
So, so you think now she's trying to keep you from sleeping?

5332
05:11:10,260 --> 05:11:14,260
Well, if she makes the explosions, it's always possible that someone else is the target.

5333
05:11:14,260 --> 05:11:20,260
We know very little about witches, and those bangs are probably nothing to do with the movements.

5334
05:11:21,260 --> 05:11:24,260
I think you guessed right, but try telling that to the movements.

5335
05:11:24,260 --> 05:11:26,260
We don't think it's like that at all.

5336
05:11:32,260 --> 05:11:34,260
Wonder if she's at home.

5337
05:11:34,260 --> 05:11:36,260
If she isn't, we can visit Alicia instead.

5338
05:11:36,260 --> 05:11:38,260
Better ask Alicia than the witch.

5339
05:11:38,260 --> 05:11:40,260
Anyway, she's more likely to tell us the truth.

5340
05:11:40,260 --> 05:11:42,260
Yes, you're right.

5341
05:11:46,260 --> 05:11:47,260
Uh-oh!

5342
05:11:51,260 --> 05:11:54,260
Look, you don't seem to realize this is a witch's house.

5343
05:11:54,260 --> 05:11:56,260
What do you mean by that?

5344
05:11:56,260 --> 05:12:01,260
I'll tell you what I mean. What I mean is, I don't want to be seen talking with goody-goodies like the moments.

5345
05:12:01,260 --> 05:12:05,260
You think they'll ruin your reputation, is that why you're so worried?

5346
05:12:08,260 --> 05:12:12,260
Uh, there's just something very important we wanted to ask you.

5347
05:12:12,260 --> 05:12:14,260
And then we'll leave straight away.

5348
05:12:21,260 --> 05:12:23,260
That room upstairs, is that Alicia's?

5349
05:12:23,260 --> 05:12:25,260
It is.

5350
05:12:25,260 --> 05:12:27,260
Is Alicia there now?

5351
05:12:27,260 --> 05:12:28,260
No, she isn't.

5352
05:12:28,260 --> 05:12:29,260
Where did she go?

5353
05:12:29,260 --> 05:12:30,260
She went to get some wolf's bang.

5354
05:12:30,260 --> 05:12:32,260
When will she be coming back?

5355
05:12:32,260 --> 05:12:34,260
You're not going to stop her studying.

5356
05:12:35,260 --> 05:12:39,260
No, we wanted to ask her something about that loud noise we hear every night.

5357
05:12:39,260 --> 05:12:41,260
Ah, that one!

5358
05:12:41,260 --> 05:12:44,260
Hey, are you the one making the bangs?

5359
05:12:44,260 --> 05:12:46,260
I don't make explosions.

5360
05:12:46,260 --> 05:12:47,260
Who is it then?

5361
05:12:47,260 --> 05:12:49,260
I really don't know.

5362
05:12:49,260 --> 05:12:51,260
But why did you say that one then?

5363
05:12:51,260 --> 05:12:53,260
Because the explosions bother me, too.

5364
05:12:54,260 --> 05:12:56,260
You think they're coming from near here?

5365
05:12:56,260 --> 05:12:59,260
I think they're coming from far away from the sea, maybe.

5366
05:12:59,260 --> 05:13:01,260
That's what snuffkin' things, too.

5367
05:13:01,260 --> 05:13:04,260
Any sound from the sea echoes off lonely mountain.

5368
05:13:04,260 --> 05:13:06,260
So you think that's where it comes from?

5369
05:13:06,260 --> 05:13:12,260
Why, as young man, a few days ago, I went all the way over to the beach to see what was happening.

5370
05:13:12,260 --> 05:13:17,260
After a whole day's witching and casting magic spells, one needs one sleep, you know.

5371
05:13:17,260 --> 05:13:19,260
So, what did you find them?

5372
05:13:19,260 --> 05:13:20,260
Nothing at all.

5373
05:13:20,260 --> 05:13:25,260
There was only one explosion that night, so when I got there on my brun, there was nothing more to see.

5374
05:13:25,260 --> 05:13:28,260
Then we still have no idea who makes the bangs.

5375
05:13:28,260 --> 05:13:31,260
No, and I really upset you thought it was me.

5376
05:13:31,260 --> 05:13:36,260
When a witch creates an explosion, it doesn't sound anything like a camel cough, I can tell you.

5377
05:13:38,260 --> 05:13:40,260
Camel cough, I like that!

5378
05:13:47,260 --> 05:13:57,260
Thank you very much, Snork Maiden.

5379
05:13:57,260 --> 05:14:01,260
This year I want to grow some black tulips.

5380
05:14:01,260 --> 05:14:04,260
Is there really such a thing as a black tulip?

5381
05:14:04,260 --> 05:14:06,260
There's such a dark red, they look black.

5382
05:14:06,260 --> 05:14:08,260
Oh, I see.

5383
05:14:08,260 --> 05:14:12,260
Although it wouldn't really surprise me, Snork Maiden, if there really were black ones somewhere.

5384
05:14:12,260 --> 05:14:14,260
We must ask the hamulaneel now.

5385
05:14:14,260 --> 05:14:16,260
Oh, yes.

5386
05:14:17,260 --> 05:14:21,260
I know it's embarrassing, but I'm so excited I can't go to sleep at night.

5387
05:14:21,260 --> 05:14:25,260
Oh, I have no problem going to sleep at night, but that noise wakes me up, Pamulane.

5388
05:14:25,260 --> 05:14:26,260
What noise is that?

5389
05:14:26,260 --> 05:14:28,260
I told you that noise.

5390
05:14:30,260 --> 05:14:33,260
Oh, I see, you're talking about the explosion.

5391
05:14:33,260 --> 05:14:35,260
You know anything about it, Mr. Himulane?

5392
05:14:35,260 --> 05:14:37,260
No, nothing at all.

5393
05:14:37,260 --> 05:14:41,260
No, those bangs are not what keeps me awake, moment papa.

5394
05:14:41,260 --> 05:14:45,260
No, I'm waiting for reply from the botanist federation.

5395
05:14:45,260 --> 05:14:46,260
reply?

5396
05:14:46,260 --> 05:14:47,260
Yes.

5397
05:14:47,260 --> 05:14:49,260
Don't you remember a few months ago?

5398
05:14:49,260 --> 05:14:50,260
Power strange.

5399
05:14:50,260 --> 05:14:52,260
I thought I told you about it.

5400
05:14:52,260 --> 05:14:54,260
Well, I certainly told everyone else I know.

5401
05:14:54,260 --> 05:14:57,260
I sent them a brand new species.

5402
05:14:57,260 --> 05:14:58,260
New species.

5403
05:14:58,260 --> 05:15:01,260
I'd never seen anything like it in my whole life.

5404
05:15:01,260 --> 05:15:02,260
A new wild orchid.

5405
05:15:02,260 --> 05:15:05,260
I'm so excited I can hardly speak.

5406
05:15:05,260 --> 05:15:06,260
Really?

5407
05:15:06,260 --> 05:15:07,260
A new wild orchid?

5408
05:15:07,260 --> 05:15:09,260
How very interesting.

5409
05:15:09,260 --> 05:15:10,260
Yes, isn't it?

5410
05:15:10,260 --> 05:15:13,260
Oh, it would be such a great honor for me and for everyone else.

5411
05:15:13,260 --> 05:15:16,260
They call it orchidaca amulensis or amuliformis.

5412
05:15:16,260 --> 05:15:18,260
No, I'm sure they will.

5413
05:15:18,260 --> 05:15:22,260
So now you understand why I've had so many sleepless nights.

5414
05:15:22,260 --> 05:15:24,260
Yes, indeed.

5415
05:15:24,260 --> 05:15:26,260
Trouble is they should have answered by now.

5416
05:15:26,260 --> 05:15:29,260
Maybe they're still trying to decide what to call it.

5417
05:15:29,260 --> 05:15:32,260
Maybe they can't decide between orchidaca amulensis

5418
05:15:32,260 --> 05:15:35,260
and orchidaca amuliformis.

5419
05:15:35,260 --> 05:15:36,260
Mmm.

5420
05:15:36,260 --> 05:15:37,260
Oh.

5421
05:15:37,260 --> 05:15:39,260
What is it?

5422
05:15:39,260 --> 05:15:42,260
Now I see, at last I understand.

5423
05:15:42,260 --> 05:15:45,260
I am getting no reply from the botanist federation

5424
05:15:45,260 --> 05:15:48,260
because it is not a new species.

5425
05:15:48,260 --> 05:15:50,260
Oh, of course.

5426
05:15:50,260 --> 05:15:52,260
Somebody's already found it.

5427
05:15:52,260 --> 05:15:53,260
Oh.

5428
05:15:53,260 --> 05:15:56,260
This is too much money.

5429
05:15:56,260 --> 05:15:57,260
No, no.

5430
05:15:57,260 --> 05:15:59,260
Stupid I am.

5431
05:15:59,260 --> 05:16:03,260
This is the end of me as a scientist, of course.

5432
05:16:03,260 --> 05:16:06,260
Calm down, don't upset yourself, Mr. Himmel.

5433
05:16:06,260 --> 05:16:10,260
Everybody will laugh at me and call me Mr. Amulensis.

5434
05:16:11,260 --> 05:16:13,260
Now listen, Mr. Himmel.

5435
05:16:13,260 --> 05:16:16,260
The reply is a long time coming because they must examine

5436
05:16:16,260 --> 05:16:19,260
your plant most carefully before making a decision.

5437
05:16:19,260 --> 05:16:22,260
They must read all the books first to be sure.

5438
05:16:24,260 --> 05:16:27,260
You really think so, Mum and Patna?

5439
05:16:27,260 --> 05:16:29,260
Could it really take so long, do you think?

5440
05:16:29,260 --> 05:16:31,260
Of course, these things take time.

5441
05:16:31,260 --> 05:16:33,260
When did you send it off?

5442
05:16:33,260 --> 05:16:35,260
A month ago.

5443
05:16:35,260 --> 05:16:37,260
There you are, that's no time at all.

5444
05:16:37,260 --> 05:16:39,260
You have to learn to be patient, Himmel.

5445
05:16:39,260 --> 05:16:40,260
You think so?

5446
05:16:40,260 --> 05:16:42,260
Oh, I feel better already.

5447
05:16:42,260 --> 05:16:45,260
Oh, I'm so glad you feel happier, Mr. Himmel.

5448
05:16:45,260 --> 05:16:47,260
Don't you worry, my friend.

5449
05:16:47,260 --> 05:16:49,260
Mama, great news dear.

5450
05:16:49,260 --> 05:16:51,260
Mr. Himmelens discovered a completely new plant

5451
05:16:51,260 --> 05:16:54,260
and is going to be called Himmelensis.

5452
05:16:54,260 --> 05:16:56,260
Oh, that's wonderful.

5453
05:16:56,260 --> 05:16:58,260
Congratulations, Mr. Himmel.

5454
05:16:58,260 --> 05:17:00,260
Oh, well, it isn't official yet.

5455
05:17:00,260 --> 05:17:03,260
No, they're just thinking about the name still.

5456
05:17:03,260 --> 05:17:05,260
Give them time.

5457
05:17:05,260 --> 05:17:08,260
We should have a party for Mr. Himmel and shouldn't we, Papa?

5458
05:17:08,260 --> 05:17:09,260
What?

5459
05:17:09,260 --> 05:17:11,260
Oh, yes, indeed.

5460
05:17:11,260 --> 05:17:13,260
When, Papa, tonight?

5461
05:17:13,260 --> 05:17:15,260
Let me think.

5462
05:17:15,260 --> 05:17:18,260
We should wait just a little bit longer, perhaps.

5463
05:17:18,260 --> 05:17:20,260
Oh, why do you say that?

5464
05:17:20,260 --> 05:17:23,260
Mr. Himmelens, you know that rare plant you found?

5465
05:17:23,260 --> 05:17:25,260
Does it have any flowers?

5466
05:17:25,260 --> 05:17:26,260
But, of course.

5467
05:17:26,260 --> 05:17:27,260
Are they pretty?

5468
05:17:27,260 --> 05:17:29,260
Very pretty.

5469
05:17:29,260 --> 05:17:32,260
Yes, just like you, Snork Maiden.

5470
05:17:32,260 --> 05:17:34,260
Oh, Mr. Himmelens.

5471
05:17:35,260 --> 05:17:37,260
Hey, look, Snork Maiden.

5472
05:17:37,260 --> 05:17:40,260
Why don't we go and find out about those explosions tonight, huh?

5473
05:17:40,260 --> 05:17:41,260
All right.

5474
05:17:41,260 --> 05:17:43,260
You'll need me to find the way.

5475
05:17:43,260 --> 05:17:44,260
You want to come along?

5476
05:17:44,260 --> 05:17:45,260
You bet.

5477
05:17:45,260 --> 05:17:47,260
They come later tonight.

5478
05:17:47,260 --> 05:17:49,260
I won't go to sleep, bad.

5479
05:17:49,260 --> 05:17:51,260
What do you think, Snork Maiden?

5480
05:17:51,260 --> 05:17:52,260
I'm not sure.

5481
05:17:52,260 --> 05:17:54,260
Isn't there anything you can do to change your mind, Moomin?

5482
05:17:54,260 --> 05:17:55,260
I don't know.

5483
05:17:55,260 --> 05:17:56,260
Listen, little Maiden.

5484
05:17:56,260 --> 05:17:57,260
You have to be careful.

5485
05:17:57,260 --> 05:17:59,260
This could be good.

5486
05:17:59,260 --> 05:18:02,260
I'm not sure, isn't there anything you can do to change your mind, Moomin?

5487
05:18:02,260 --> 05:18:03,260
You have to be careful.

5488
05:18:03,260 --> 05:18:05,260
This could be dangerous.

5489
05:18:05,260 --> 05:18:07,260
Obviously, or I wouldn't come.

5490
05:18:07,260 --> 05:18:08,260
Would I spoil my sleep?

5491
05:18:08,260 --> 05:18:10,260
Well, stick close to us then.

5492
05:18:10,260 --> 05:18:11,260
Yes, do that.

5493
05:18:11,260 --> 05:18:15,260
I also went down to the beach late last night to try and find out what was happening.

5494
05:18:15,260 --> 05:18:19,260
And while I was there, I saw the witch flying around on her broomstick.

5495
05:18:19,260 --> 05:18:20,260
Oh, really?

5496
05:18:20,260 --> 05:18:22,260
Why didn't you tell me so I could have come along?

5497
05:18:22,260 --> 05:18:24,260
I could hide better than you.

5498
05:18:24,260 --> 05:18:25,260
You're so white.

5499
05:18:25,260 --> 05:18:26,260
See, Moomin?

5500
05:18:26,260 --> 05:18:29,260
I'm not big in white like you.

5501
05:18:29,260 --> 05:18:31,260
Oh, there's someone coming.

5502
05:18:31,260 --> 05:18:32,260
Who?

5503
05:18:36,260 --> 05:18:37,260
It's Alicia.

5504
05:18:37,260 --> 05:18:38,260
Hi, Alicia.

5505
05:18:38,260 --> 05:18:39,260
Hi, Alicia.

5506
05:18:39,260 --> 05:18:41,260
Oh, Moomin.

5507
05:18:41,260 --> 05:18:43,260
Hello, Alicia.

5508
05:18:43,260 --> 05:18:44,260
How are you?

5509
05:18:44,260 --> 05:18:47,260
Have you three come here to play with me?

5510
05:18:47,260 --> 05:18:50,260
No, I'm afraid we have, but it's good to see you.

5511
05:18:50,260 --> 05:18:51,260
Yes, Alicia.

5512
05:18:51,260 --> 05:18:52,260
Yes?

5513
05:18:52,260 --> 05:18:55,260
Has your grandmother been kind to you since your last visit to us?

5514
05:18:55,260 --> 05:18:56,260
Very kind.

5515
05:18:56,260 --> 05:18:58,260
She's been treating me very well.

5516
05:18:58,260 --> 05:19:00,260
Ever since I stopped coming to see you?

5517
05:19:00,260 --> 05:19:01,260
Oh, good.

5518
05:19:01,260 --> 05:19:03,260
But we don't miss you, Alicia.

5519
05:19:03,260 --> 05:19:04,260
Oh, I miss you, too.

5520
05:19:04,260 --> 05:19:06,260
But I must keep my promise to her.

5521
05:19:06,260 --> 05:19:08,260
She'd be upset if I broke it.

5522
05:19:08,260 --> 05:19:09,260
What are these wings?

5523
05:19:09,260 --> 05:19:10,260
They're herbs.

5524
05:19:10,260 --> 05:19:12,260
Herbs are very important for a witch.

5525
05:19:12,260 --> 05:19:16,260
And frogs, bellies, and lizard's tails, they're important, too, of course.

5526
05:19:16,260 --> 05:19:18,260
I think that's licorice.

5527
05:19:18,260 --> 05:19:19,260
That's right.

5528
05:19:19,260 --> 05:19:20,260
Very clever, Snuffkin.

5529
05:19:20,260 --> 05:19:22,260
We use that for heartburn and coughs.

5530
05:19:22,260 --> 05:19:24,260
The taste smells quite nice.

5531
05:19:24,260 --> 05:19:27,260
And it also stops cows from giving their milk.

5532
05:19:27,260 --> 05:19:28,260
I see.

5533
05:19:28,260 --> 05:19:29,260
That's interesting.

5534
05:19:31,260 --> 05:19:34,260
Oh, keeps my promise.

5535
05:19:34,260 --> 05:19:36,260
I love you, thanks.

5536
05:19:51,260 --> 05:19:53,260
Oh, it's a ride.

5537
05:19:53,260 --> 05:19:55,260
Hello, Mr Hail.

5538
05:19:55,260 --> 05:19:56,260
Mr. Ann Hehman.

5539
05:19:56,260 --> 05:19:57,260
Splendid days.

5540
05:19:57,260 --> 05:19:59,260
Hello, Mr. Ann Bellin.

5541
05:19:59,260 --> 05:20:00,860
I work so hard.

5542
05:20:00,860 --> 05:20:02,860
Yeah, I guess I do with that.

5543
05:20:05,060 --> 05:20:07,060
Wait, stop.

5544
05:20:07,060 --> 05:20:09,060
What is it, Mr. Hemuellen?

5545
05:20:09,060 --> 05:20:11,860
My letter. I just want my letter.

5546
05:20:11,860 --> 05:20:13,260
There isn't one.

5547
05:20:13,260 --> 05:20:14,460
But why not?

5548
05:20:14,460 --> 05:20:17,360
You didn't have any yesterday or the day before.

5549
05:20:17,360 --> 05:20:20,960
Yeah, I know that. Nobody's written to you. That's why.

5550
05:20:20,960 --> 05:20:22,560
Well, somebody should have written.

5551
05:20:22,560 --> 05:20:26,160
Are you quite, quite sure that you've gone through your bag properly?

5552
05:20:26,160 --> 05:20:30,060
Don't you know I'm expecting an important letter from an important scientist.

5553
05:20:30,060 --> 05:20:31,660
It must be in your bag.

5554
05:20:31,660 --> 05:20:34,160
Ah, alright then. Go ahead.

5555
05:20:34,160 --> 05:20:34,760
What?

5556
05:20:34,760 --> 05:20:38,360
Well, you don't seem to trust me to do my job properly, Mr. Hemuellen.

5557
05:20:38,360 --> 05:20:41,160
Go ahead and have a look for yourself then.

5558
05:20:41,160 --> 05:20:43,660
Oh, but of course I trust you. Sorry.

5559
05:20:43,660 --> 05:20:45,760
No, no. You better have a look.

5560
05:20:45,760 --> 05:20:46,860
What do you think I do?

5561
05:20:46,860 --> 05:20:49,260
Steam them open and read them at night?

5562
05:20:49,260 --> 05:20:50,460
No.

5563
05:20:50,460 --> 05:20:53,860
Oh, you seem to have a lot of letters today.

5564
05:20:54,860 --> 05:20:58,860
Oh, I really think I should ask for a higher salary.

5565
05:20:58,860 --> 05:21:00,360
I deserve it.

5566
05:21:02,860 --> 05:21:04,860
I'm just starving.

5567
05:21:04,860 --> 05:21:08,360
I might have to go over and visit the moments in a minute.

5568
05:21:16,360 --> 05:21:19,360
I'm sleepy too. I could go on sleeping.

5569
05:21:19,860 --> 05:21:21,860
Oh!

5570
05:21:21,860 --> 05:21:23,860
What do you think you're doing?

5571
05:21:23,860 --> 05:21:27,360
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

5572
05:21:27,360 --> 05:21:30,860
Hmm? There's nothing else out here and you didn't see me?

5573
05:21:30,860 --> 05:21:32,360
I'm sorry.

5574
05:21:32,360 --> 05:21:34,860
Oh dear. What does this matter with you?

5575
05:21:34,860 --> 05:21:37,360
Is this place called Moomin Valley?

5576
05:21:37,360 --> 05:21:39,360
Yes. That's right.

5577
05:21:39,360 --> 05:21:43,360
At last, I found it. I never thought I'd really make it.

5578
05:21:43,360 --> 05:21:46,360
Excuse me. Are you alright?

5579
05:21:46,360 --> 05:21:48,360
Doctor me, miss.

5580
05:21:48,360 --> 05:21:51,360
No, tell me what's bothering you.

5581
05:21:51,360 --> 05:21:54,360
Oh, she's ill. She's got a fever.

5582
05:21:54,360 --> 05:21:56,360
Please leave me alone.

5583
05:21:56,360 --> 05:22:00,360
But you can lie here. You should be in bed, young lady.

5584
05:22:00,360 --> 05:22:02,860
Do you know a man called Hamilton?

5585
05:22:02,860 --> 05:22:06,360
Yes. Have you walked all the way to Moomin Valley to visit him?

5586
05:22:06,360 --> 05:22:10,360
So I have come to the right place. He does live here.

5587
05:22:10,360 --> 05:22:12,860
Oh, yes. He lives very close to here.

5588
05:22:12,860 --> 05:22:16,860
I'm so glad I must see him immediately.

5589
05:22:16,860 --> 05:22:19,860
Oh, what shall I do? I must do something.

5590
05:22:19,860 --> 05:22:22,860
Come here, someone. Someone help me.

5591
05:22:22,860 --> 05:22:24,860
Oh, my goodness.

5592
05:22:26,860 --> 05:22:32,860
Help! Anyone help! Help me somebody!

5593
05:22:43,860 --> 05:22:45,860
Papa! Papa!

5594
05:22:45,860 --> 05:22:48,860
He's up in the guest room. If you want him, mom is there as well.

5595
05:22:48,860 --> 05:22:50,860
What for?

5596
05:22:50,860 --> 05:22:52,860
I just rescued a girl, you know.

5597
05:22:52,860 --> 05:22:53,860
A girl?

5598
05:22:53,860 --> 05:22:54,860
Did you sniff?

5599
05:22:54,860 --> 05:22:58,860
That's right. Very pretty, too. She's ill and I put her to bed myself.

5600
05:22:58,860 --> 05:23:00,860
I'm going to see her.

5601
05:23:00,860 --> 05:23:02,860
Me, too.

5602
05:23:02,860 --> 05:23:06,860
I want another look as well.

5603
05:23:06,860 --> 05:23:09,860
First, we must bring her fever down.

5604
05:23:09,860 --> 05:23:11,860
I think you're right.

5605
05:23:12,860 --> 05:23:14,860
Yes?

5606
05:23:16,860 --> 05:23:18,860
Sniff just told us about her.

5607
05:23:18,860 --> 05:23:20,860
Oh, dear. Is she unconscious?

5608
05:23:20,860 --> 05:23:21,860
Yes.

5609
05:23:21,860 --> 05:23:22,860
Where'd she come from?

5610
05:23:22,860 --> 05:23:26,860
We don't know a little, Maya, but Sniff said she'd come here to visit the hemeland.

5611
05:23:26,860 --> 05:23:29,860
That's right. Snort Maidens gone to get him.

5612
05:23:29,860 --> 05:23:31,860
She's pretty, isn't she?

5613
05:23:31,860 --> 05:23:33,860
You're right. Very.

5614
05:23:33,860 --> 05:23:36,860
By the way, Moomin, what did the witch say?

5615
05:23:36,860 --> 05:23:40,860
Oh, dear. I thought I'd really run like this.

5616
05:23:40,860 --> 05:23:42,860
She's missing her young girl.

5617
05:23:42,860 --> 05:23:45,860
Well, if she's sick, why don't you give her some medicine?

5618
05:23:45,860 --> 05:23:47,860
I don't know any young girls apart from her.

5619
05:23:47,860 --> 05:23:49,860
Don't. Just keep running.

5620
05:23:55,860 --> 05:23:58,860
I told you. I do not know this person.

5621
05:23:58,860 --> 05:23:59,860
Maybe she's changed.

5622
05:23:59,860 --> 05:24:01,860
I've already told you.

5623
05:24:01,860 --> 05:24:03,860
I have never known any young girls.

5624
05:24:03,860 --> 05:24:07,860
Then why do you think she'd want to come to visit you, Hamilton?

5625
05:24:07,860 --> 05:24:09,860
She's a botanist.

5626
05:24:09,860 --> 05:24:14,860
And obviously, she's heard of me and wants to come and see the famous hemeland for herself.

5627
05:24:14,860 --> 05:24:17,860
Oh, dear. She can tell us when she wakes up.

5628
05:24:17,860 --> 05:24:20,860
We must leave her now so that grandma's medicine can work.

5629
05:24:26,860 --> 05:24:28,860
I think I'll be getting home.

5630
05:24:28,860 --> 05:24:30,860
Oh, we couldn't let you go just like that.

5631
05:24:30,860 --> 05:24:32,860
Please, stay and have some tea with us.

5632
05:24:32,860 --> 05:24:35,860
Thank you, but no, I have some plans to press.

5633
05:24:35,860 --> 05:24:38,860
And you're sure you're quite sure you don't know this girl?

5634
05:24:38,860 --> 05:24:40,860
Absolutely certain.

5635
05:24:40,860 --> 05:24:42,860
I really must go.

5636
05:24:45,860 --> 05:24:48,860
I'd forgotten all about the bangs.

5637
05:24:48,860 --> 05:24:50,860
Well, we haven't snuffed Ken and I.

5638
05:24:50,860 --> 05:24:51,860
I'm going to look for them tonight.

5639
05:24:51,860 --> 05:24:53,860
I'd like to come too, but I can't.

5640
05:24:53,860 --> 05:24:55,860
I'm going with them.

5641
05:24:55,860 --> 05:24:56,860
Are you snort maiden?

5642
05:24:56,860 --> 05:24:59,860
You'll be hiding on the beach in the middle of the night?

5643
05:24:59,860 --> 05:25:03,860
Yes. And then we'll rush off to where the bangs are coming from as soon as we hear them.

5644
05:25:03,860 --> 05:25:04,860
That's the plan.

5645
05:25:04,860 --> 05:25:06,860
Oh, I'd really love to come.

5646
05:25:06,860 --> 05:25:08,860
I'd rather go to bed.

5647
05:25:08,860 --> 05:25:11,860
I'd be a bit scared of the beach in the middle of the night.

5648
05:25:11,860 --> 05:25:14,860
After all, it's my duty to stay here with movement mama.

5649
05:25:14,860 --> 05:25:16,860
Are you coming, sniff?

5650
05:25:16,860 --> 05:25:18,860
Certainly not. Not me.

5651
05:25:22,860 --> 05:25:24,860
It just occurred to me that's why she's here.

5652
05:25:24,860 --> 05:25:25,860
Oh.

5653
05:25:37,860 --> 05:25:39,860
Here, you better take this movement.

5654
05:25:39,860 --> 05:25:41,860
You might get very hungry.

5655
05:25:41,860 --> 05:25:42,860
Oh, thank you, mama.

5656
05:25:42,860 --> 05:25:45,860
A midnight snack. I really envy you.

5657
05:25:45,860 --> 05:25:48,860
Well, then, Papa. Why don't you come with us?

5658
05:25:48,860 --> 05:25:52,860
Oh, there's nothing I'd love more, but I'd better not tonight. Right, mama?

5659
05:25:52,860 --> 05:25:54,860
Oh, definitely not.

5660
05:25:54,860 --> 05:25:58,860
What would I do if something happened to the girl while you were away?

5661
05:25:58,860 --> 05:25:59,860
Exactly.

5662
05:25:59,860 --> 05:26:02,860
All right, Papa. We'll find out about the bangs for you.

5663
05:26:02,860 --> 05:26:04,860
Thank you, mama.

5664
05:26:07,860 --> 05:26:08,860
Mmm.

5665
05:26:10,860 --> 05:26:11,860
Mmm.

5666
05:26:11,860 --> 05:26:13,860
Mmm.

5667
05:26:13,860 --> 05:26:15,860
Mmm. Good.

5668
05:26:15,860 --> 05:26:17,860
I think we should save this food for a while.

5669
05:26:17,860 --> 05:26:20,860
We might have to wait a long time for the explosions.

5670
05:26:20,860 --> 05:26:22,860
And they might not come tonight.

5671
05:26:22,860 --> 05:26:25,860
Stop stuffing yourself, Moon, and the rest is for a snuck in and me.

5672
05:26:25,860 --> 05:26:27,860
But you can't eat anymore?

5673
05:26:27,860 --> 05:26:31,860
Yes, I can. We must share it in equal parts, otherwise it's not fair.

5674
05:26:31,860 --> 05:26:34,860
I think it should be shared in proportion to how big one is.

5675
05:26:37,860 --> 05:26:38,860
Mmm.

5676
05:26:38,860 --> 05:26:39,860
Mmm.

5677
05:26:43,860 --> 05:26:45,860
Mmm.

5678
05:26:48,860 --> 05:26:50,860
Mmm.

5679
05:26:58,860 --> 05:26:59,860
Mmm.

5680
05:27:03,860 --> 05:27:05,860
Uh, where are the fingerprints?

5681
05:27:05,860 --> 05:27:14,860
to see. Keep a sharp look out. Look over there. What is it?

5682
05:27:20,860 --> 05:27:24,860
That's what I call fireworks.

5683
05:27:26,860 --> 05:27:30,860
Come on. Somebody must be out there in a boat.

5684
05:27:36,860 --> 05:27:40,860
There's a boat.

5685
05:27:41,860 --> 05:27:46,860
The fireworks must have come from there. Hey, come ashore!

5686
05:27:47,860 --> 05:27:53,860
Is that the hemuline you think? No, I don't think so. It looks like him, but he was much younger.

5687
05:27:54,860 --> 05:28:02,860
And so as a result of their excursion to the beach, they finally learned that the big bangs that had been waking everyone up were fireworks.

5688
05:28:02,860 --> 05:28:07,860
They also learned that the fireworks were coming from a boat far out to sea.

5689
05:28:08,860 --> 05:28:12,860
But the man who had sent them up disappeared into the night.

5690
05:28:32,860 --> 05:28:49,860
The Moons are having fun day after day. The Moons. The Moons. The Moons.
