1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,620
here they are for one and all the movements are about to come on and sit down here with

2
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:30,460
me here for you on your TV they are the movements they are the movements so come

3
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:37,260
with me give me your hand I'll take you up to a moment land you can fly just

4
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,660
like a bird sing that song ever there were the movements there were the

5
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:59,380
movements there were the movements there were the movements

6
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:15,180
one night movement was having a dream what a wonderful feeling to be flying like this

7
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,700
look over there movement what a beautiful lake this is one of the most fantastic

8
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,580
experiences I've ever had me too I never knew birds had such a marvelous life

9
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,780
seeing things from a completely different point of view we're flying pretty high aren't we

10
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:44,220
I'm scared we're much too high let's go down please let's go down at once I'm not scared of heights

11
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:53,180
oh snorke this time you really have succeeded will I could build hundreds of these if you wanted me to

12
00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:03,260
snorke can I steer just for a little while oh thank you do you really know how to steer

13
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:24,100
this is okay really it's just a dream

14
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:50,540
oh gosh my head hurt so what a strange dream why would my brother let stinky

15
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:57,140
steer his flying ship surely not I was talking to snorke while I looked away

16
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:03,380
suddenly stinky took his place oh and then the thing began tilting hmm but it was just a dream

17
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,860
I don't care I don't like it you shouldn't have dreams like that just for my brother's flying ship is

18
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,500
almost ready dreams often come true you know but it was nothing like the ship your brother's

19
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,580
building it was totally different but tell me what happened to it in the end did it fall down I

20
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,780
don't know I lost sight of it when I fell off and I didn't see it again well surely you could have

21
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:32,660
turned your head to take a look well I didn't listen moment don't say a word to the snorke

22
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:39,060
about this he's nervous enough as it is of course not why don't we just forget about it pretend it

23
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:48,660
never happened oh snorke it's finally completed sure it is but it hasn't been flown yet of course

24
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,940
but it will I want it snorke you don't think there's anything wrong with it of course not but it's

25
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:02,980
just there's some problem snorke well there might be so what is it fuel fuel but you said you

26
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:09,620
had developed a new fuel that was really good it's good but you see you see it might not be

27
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:17,140
powerful enough you mean it might be able to fly no it won't you're quite right or it will

28
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:23,220
just be an ordinary ship not a flying ship oh that would be nice what can't go up can't possibly

29
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,140
but that's not the point if it won't fly everyone will laugh at me I know they will

30
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,900
I won't laugh I promise maybe not others will but you wouldn't care about that would you

31
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,020
who cares what other people think the thing is I've already told people that the test flight

32
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:48,740
will be quite soon in public but I'm sure people will be very nice about it even if it doesn't get

33
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:56,420
off the ground that's hardly what I want moving I'd like to ask you a favor that's why I sent

34
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:02,420
for you will you help me I'll do anything you ask snorke of course what I would like is for you

35
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:13,060
moving my friend to be test pilot for me tomorrow you want me to be a pilot

36
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:42,660
hey stinky stinky oh listen stinky I'm going to steer that ship is that perfectly clear

37
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,260
you're not to touch the wheel I'm the pilot now

38
00:05:52,820 --> 00:06:00,660
what on earth was that a bear wouldn't you find it difficult to steer it oh no it's real easy

39
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,700
but of course I need to practice before the public demonstration is the snorke going to fly

40
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,700
his own ship he'll be there but he has to stay down in the engine room snuff can I wonder if

41
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:20,420
this ship will really fly the only problem is the fuel only the fuel you say that's a big problem

42
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:28,260
I suppose so listen woman suppose now the snorke's flying ship really gets off the ground well of

43
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,740
course it's going to papa that something could happen something could break or you could fall

44
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:40,100
into an air pocket it's such a dangerous undertaking think moment papa now listen it's not natural

45
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:46,340
for moments to fly about up in the air is it snuff can quite right well would you and the snorke

46
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:52,900
do if things went wrong we will be wearing parachutes you know parachutes you don't know what they

47
00:06:52,900 --> 00:07:01,380
are don't you papa of course I do they come down from the sky like this exactly but of course

48
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:08,660
we won't need a parachute because nothing will go wrong and I will be the first flying ship pilot ever

49
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:20,580
oh hi there hello my young man hello how do you do how do you do everybody hello sir I wonder if

50
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:27,300
you can help me do you happen to know where the snorke's factory is you mean the ship I must

51
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,780
see him I'm most eager to have a look at his famous flying ship how do you know about that it's

52
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:40,260
supposed to be very secret the information must have leaked out somehow oh well all inventors know

53
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:47,620
about what he is trying to do he's famous throughout moving valley this snorke really are you an

54
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:54,900
inventor too indeed I am one of the more famous I think maybe the most famous of them all I am

55
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:02,740
moment papa how do you do sir I'm snuff can and my name is moment please to meet you a very good

56
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:14,900
day to you one and all the muffles my name I said I'm the muffled you mean you've never even heard

57
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:22,420
of me the most famous inventor oh yes I'm sure I am the muffled isn't it yes it is the muffled have

58
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:28,740
you invented anything exciting muffled mr. muffled I it would be much easier to tell you what I

59
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,740
haven't invented young man for instance the pin that can't prick because it has two heads the

60
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,420
newspaper that reads itself the purse that moans and groans if you take money from it the adhesive

61
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:45,780
tape that sticks only to itself this is perhaps the greatest of all my latest inventions

62
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:53,220
whatever is that this is proper self a man powered fan infanible in muddy weather

63
00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:13,220
all these are my latest inventions you didn't know that did you know we didn't but try and give

64
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:19,620
a handkerchief the square balloon the five wheel car the hexagonal frying pan the seven hole

65
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,780
button and a host of others indeed how interesting here what did you want to see the snorke

66
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:31,540
about I thought I might be able to help him out with one of my inventions that's what oh dear

67
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:40,420
which one my new no it's very top secret stuff I can tell you now where is the snorke's factory I'll

68
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:48,020
take you right there very kind of you come he'll be so surprised must be off see you again it's a

69
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:54,980
pleasure to help these budding inventors snorkel be so excited famous inventor what is your

70
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:01,380
opinion snuffkin have you ever seen a triangular handkerchief movement papa no when I don't want to

71
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:08,100
either I do wonder what he's cooked up for the snorke though it is sort of intriguing yes indeed

72
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,380
women will be able to tell us later I suppose yes but anything could happen before then can we

73
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:27,700
wait that long snuffkin you're right no wait for me I'm coming with you oh I thought we had

74
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,300
several guests we're in the world if they all gone

75
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,500
now where are they off to I wonder

76
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:08,420
oh look who's coming what are you doing here we're just interested

77
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:16,020
where are the muffle and the snorke the snorke and the muffle are discussing some top secret project

78
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:22,900
it's very harsh not a triangular handkerchief I hope I don't know papa as I said it's top secret

79
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:31,300
hmm let's see oh bother the curtains in the way so I can't see a thing

80
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:40,420
so this is the powerful fuel you've developed is it mr muffle yes it is not as original as

81
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:47,380
my other inventions I admit but very useful yes useful I call it super fuel only trouble is my

82
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:53,540
engine has been designed for liquid fuel no problem at all young man if you dissolve this

83
00:11:53,540 --> 00:12:00,740
block of fuel in 10 liters of water your engine will run for at least 10 hours for 10 whole hours

84
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,780
that's incredible if you doubt the word of the muffle then try it out and see for yourself

85
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:12,660
right now right now better still I guarantee that if used as it is in a solid state your engine

86
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:19,300
will run not for 10 but for 100 hours 100 hours but that's incredible you really must be some

87
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:27,380
inventor indeed if what you say is true it would solve the last problem of my flying ship oh now

88
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:33,700
that I've looked more closely at the padlock this store isn't locked no it isn't so if one

89
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,660
wanted to see the snorke one could work right here but why would you want to see him papa well

90
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:46,500
why don't you tell us I don't want snorke falling for one of the muffles crazy ideas that's why

91
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,940
well we'll find out pretty soon maybe you don't realize it but the snorke is pretty clever you know

92
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,140
I think I know exactly what they're doing in there yeah what

93
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,420
I saw that man pouring something into the flying ship what was it well I guess it must have

94
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,620
been fuel movement how come you saw him there's a crack that's just about wide enough for me

95
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,860
but I won't tell you where what are those two in there talking about oh yeah so this is the great

96
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:22,180
super fuel wait a minute snorke there must be something wrong with it yeah you are

97
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:29,060
fair you are solid fuel indeed huh a hundred hours you're an imposter sir oh it isn't true if

98
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:34,740
you just let me explain no thank you I know very well why you came over here with that ridiculous

99
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:41,140
story off with you right now listen to me it is not ridiculous and it is not just a story

100
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:47,540
maybe we shouldn't have dissolved it in the water that was a mistake imposter but I'm the

101
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:53,140
mother I don't care maybe it's just a misunderstanding and the fuel isn't suited for flying ships

102
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,500
wrong it suits everything forget the fuel that was just a trick so he could come here and get

103
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:05,620
to see my flying ship so the muffler has come here to spy mean ridiculous I don't steal

104
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:14,660
papa was there anything you wanted to see me about huh no I just dropped by no cause for excitement

105
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,780
the fuels are done no it's not that's not true I don't invent guns what would be the point of

106
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:25,460
inventing them oh listen to me please let's try and use the fuel once more small thanks once

107
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:30,100
was once too many I'll have to clean my tanks from your gunge get out of my sight

108
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,900
oh dear this must have been a bit of a disappointment for the snorke I know

109
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:59,620
now listen stinky I'm doing this for the snorke say isn't that so I don't care

110
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,940
you're doing it for all I want is to get a good look at the famous flying ship you'd need

111
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,740
something very powerful to get a thing like that off the ground something so powerful that only

112
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,540
I the muffler could ever have invented it remind me one day to show you my famous triangular

113
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,780
handkerchief now all we have to do is not dissolve the fuel in water but use the solid fuel hurry

114
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:26,100
up with that lock sticky or maybe I should invent a lock pick come on stinky hurry hurry

115
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:33,300
there you're done good come we don't have much time no I'm dying to steer this ship

116
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,300
oh

117
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,860
me up take it up to 2,000 meters yeah

118
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,140
oh stinky stinky we're flying at a height of just over 2,000 meters now

119
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:52,580
stinky yeah I'm listening what is it when you hear me say now that's when I want you to start

120
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:58,580
up the engine immediately all right no problem I guess it must be this one no no not yet

121
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:05,780
this is it just a drop of water on the fuel block now that should do it can I start it now

122
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,100
not yet all right

123
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,780
now start up the interesting key my answer

124
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:25,300
did you really turn on the switch yes I did the engine won't start are you quite sure you turn

125
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:31,460
the one I pointed out to you I think so maybe I turned the wrong one there outside these two

126
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,500
as well come on stinky this is no joke my reputation as a famous inventor is at stake

127
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:43,300
this should do it I think is that work Mr. Mapple nothing is happening I do I shouldn't

128
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:49,140
have let you do it better to do it myself you're useless wait Mr. Mapple I haven't tried the very

129
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,260
last one in the row this one switch left what I better throw that one too you never know it might

130
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,260
just do the trick

131
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,700
I'm not surprised but I'm so pleased with myself

132
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:31,060
you should be here snort this is my great moment and you should be here to share it with me come on

133
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,820
I can't wait to try this thing

134
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:44,020
incredible this ship to rise like a Phoenix not the most imagine this is one of my desert inventions

135
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,340
wait

136
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,420
come on let me go come on

137
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,100
sheer power I don't think it is starting out

138
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,660
I very much afraid it's exploding

139
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,060
whoa hey stinky religions exploding

140
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,180
where it gets the back to find out about this ship it's going to explode any minute by wonderful

141
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,220
fantastic

142
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,260
oh

143
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:13,900
Now come to your nice room on the small side, but the very best one.

144
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,300
That explosion...

145
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,780
It really was most unexpected, officer.

146
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,340
Everybody knows you're a great inventor.

147
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,820
I wonder if you could help me, Mr. Muffel.

148
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,820
But how?

149
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,740
Could you think of something to protect my roses while you're staying with us?

150
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,340
A non-explosive, of course.

151
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,500
Of course I could.

152
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,140
Piece of cake, officer.

153
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,740
Oh, I really did want to fly.

154
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,300
Come, come now, cheer up, snorke dear.

155
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,980
Here you are, a nice cup of tea.

156
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,980
Thanks.

157
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,420
It's very strange, but I had a dream the other night about a flying ship.

158
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,020
Did you really move in?

159
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,220
That sounds very interesting.

160
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,900
Yes, very interesting.

161
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,700
Moment, tell me about it.

162
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,780
Yes, it was a peculiar looking ship, totally different from your flying ship, snorke.

163
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,220
Different, huh?

164
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:12,460
Well, it was sort of round like this.

165
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,260
It had a propeller and something hanging underneath.

166
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,380
And we flew over a high mountain.

167
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,620
Round?

168
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,540
Yes.

169
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,380
And you were in a sort of thing hanging underneath?

170
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,180
Yes.

171
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,620
Round?

172
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,220
Round, huh?

173
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,580
Round?

174
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,700
What ever is the matter, snorke?

175
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,980
What?

176
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,180
Oh, mama, thanks for the tea.

177
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,140
I think I'm getting a new idea.

178
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,780
Moment, see you later.

179
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,380
Papa, I must go.

180
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,020
Oh, there he goes again.

181
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,300
I know that, look, mama.

182
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,020
You won't get an intelligent answer out of him for the next month or so, honestly.

183
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,020
I'm very happy for him.

184
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,940
I must say that was a very clever dream you had, Moment.

185
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,420
I'm a better inventor than the model.

186
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,580
Unusual triangular acruchy.

187
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,940
So the explosion didn't distress the snort for long.

188
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:15,260
Soon he was back at his favorite occupation, planning, but planning what?

189
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,260
Rome.

190
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,260
Yeah.

191
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,260
Rome.

192
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Yeah.

193
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
Rome.

194
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:42,260
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements, believing in sharing and

195
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,260
giving the movements.

196
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,260
They're always happy and goes at play.

197
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,260
The movements are having fun day after day.

198
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,260
The movements.

199
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,260
The movements.

200
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:07,260
The movements.

201
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:22,260
The movements.

202
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:32,260
The movements.
