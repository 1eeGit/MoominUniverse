580120,582120,"Perhaps he doesn't want to tell anyone.",578300,581500,"SPEAKER_10"
582120,584120,"Yeah, probably because his new pet bites.",581600,584200,"SPEAKER_14"
584120,586120,"Well, it hasn't bitten you yet, hasn't it?",581600,584200,"SPEAKER_14"

596120,600120,"I suppose certain people might keep other small things in jars,",592500,596600,"SPEAKER_13"
600120,604120,"beetles and spiders, mosquitoes, scorpions, or poisonous centipedes,",597200,610300,"SPEAKER_14"
604120,606120,"horrible things that multiply and multiply every week",597200,610300,"SPEAKER_14"

612120,614120,"See? Like that.",597200,610300,"SPEAKER_14"

616120,620120,"and they'll take over moving valley and eat us all.",614600,619400,"SPEAKER_14"
620120,622120,"Oh, well, I haven't got a centipede.",619800,621800,"SPEAKER_13"

624120,626120,"But this is the Earth's deer.",623000,627000,"SPEAKER_07"
626120,630120,"The rain could have brought them down from space, Mama, couldn't it?",623000,627000,"SPEAKER_07"
630120,632120,"Well, you could be right.",627200,629900,"SPEAKER_14"
632120,634120,"It was raining very hard yesterday.",631100,634800,"SPEAKER_07"
634120,636120,"And it wasn't like ordinary rain.",631100,634800,"SPEAKER_07"
636120,640120,"I saw a puddle as big as a lake.",634900,637000,"SPEAKER_14"
642120,644120,"What's the matter, Moomin?",637700,640000,"SPEAKER_11"

648120,650120,"Huh. We're on the right track, though.",643900,645100,"SPEAKER_14"
650120,652120,"Well, I'm glad it's not a poisonous centipede.",648600,650100,"SPEAKER_14"
652120,654120,"I shouldn't have liked that.",650800,654200,"SPEAKER_10"

674120,676120,"Yes, I have.",671300,674700,"SPEAKER_13"
676120,678120,"Tell them they mustn't go into my room.",675000,676300,"SPEAKER_13"
678120,680120,"Or they'll have to take the consequence, sis.",676600,678700,"SPEAKER_13"
680120,684120,"All right, Moomin. I'll make sure no one goes in there.",679300,681600,"SPEAKER_13"
684120,686120,"I promise.",681900,685600,"SPEAKER_10"
686120,690120,"Oh, but he's going to tell Snuffkin the secret.",681900,685600,"SPEAKER_10"
690120,692120,"I should think he is.",687900,690800,"SPEAKER_14"
692120,696120,"Best friends always come first, little Mai.",691400,692800,"SPEAKER_10"

718120,720120,"Fishing again?",717700,718700,"SPEAKER_13"
720120,724120,"Yep. The cards told me that if I caught five minutes, one right after the other, I'd be traveling south.",719300,724500,"SPEAKER_08"
724120,726120,"South?",719300,724500,"SPEAKER_08"
726120,728120,"You're joking.",725300,726000,"SPEAKER_08"
728120,730120,"Not at all. I believe in the cards.",727800,727800,"SPEAKER_08"

730120,734120,"But Snuffkin, winter's not here yet.",728200,730000,"SPEAKER_08"
734120,738120,"I know that. But the cards tell you things for a reason, Moomin.",733600,734300,"SPEAKER_08"
738120,740120,"Do they really?",737600,739200,"SPEAKER_13"
740120,742120,"But it would be awfully few anyway, Snuffkin.",739700,747900,"SPEAKER_13"
742120,745120,"It's just awful. I mean, I'd be very lonely.",739700,747900,"SPEAKER_13"
745120,748120,"And anyway, who would I talk to, or tell my secrets to?",739700,747900,"SPEAKER_13"
751120,755120,"Oh, Snuffkin, quickly. You must come up to Moomin House.",750900,751400,"SPEAKER_13"
755120,756120,"Now?",753200,754900,"SPEAKER_13"
756120,757120,"Yeah.",755700,756200,"SPEAKER_13"
757120,759120,"Well, I suppose I could fish later.",756600,758700,"SPEAKER_08"
759120,761120,"No, no. There's no point.",759000,760500,"SPEAKER_13"
761120,763120,"But I have to catch five minutes.",761100,762900,"SPEAKER_08"
763120,764120,"Oh.",761100,762900,"SPEAKER_08"
764120,767120,"The fish won't bite after all is rain. You'd catch nothing.",763700,769300,"SPEAKER_13"
767120,770120,"It'll be better to wait until it stops flowing so fast.",763700,769300,"SPEAKER_13"
770120,772120,"Well, perhaps you're right.",770000,771500,"SPEAKER_08"
772120,774120,"So what's this big secret all about?",770000,771500,"SPEAKER_08"
774120,776120,"Hey, Moomin.",773800,774200,"SPEAKER_13"
776120,779120,"Have you ever seen a dragon Snuffkin?",774500,775400,"SPEAKER_08"
779120,781120,"No, of course not.",779100,779100,"SPEAKER_13"
781120,785120,"They all disappeared off the face of the earth many hundreds of years ago.",779800,781000,"SPEAKER_08"
785120,788120,"But perhaps they didn't all disappear.",785100,785300,"SPEAKER_13"
788120,790120,"What if there was one alive somewhere?",788100,789900,"SPEAKER_13"
790120,792120,"That's impossible.",788100,789900,"SPEAKER_13"
792120,795120,"It could be so small that it would go in a glass jar Snuffkin.",792000,795100,"SPEAKER_13"
795120,797120,"Are you sure you're not daydreaming Moomin?",792000,795100,"SPEAKER_13"
797120,800120,"But still, anything is possible, I suppose.",795300,800100,"SPEAKER_08"
800120,801120,"But you know me.",795300,800100,"SPEAKER_08"
801120,804120,"I have to see it right in front of me before I believe it.",800500,803900,"SPEAKER_08"
809120,811120,"Oh, where is it?",800500,803900,"SPEAKER_08"
811120,814120,"Mama promised me that she wouldn't let anyone in.",810100,810800,"SPEAKER_13"
819120,821120,"It's not here either.",811600,814000,"SPEAKER_13"
821120,823120,"Well, you were right, Moomin.",819600,820900,"SPEAKER_13"
823120,824120,"What?",821300,822800,"SPEAKER_08"
828120,830120,"Ah, there he is.",823700,824000,"SPEAKER_13"
830120,832120,"I think you've found a real dragon.",829600,829600,"SPEAKER_12"
830120,832120,"I think you've found a real dragon.",829600,831000,"SPEAKER_13"
832120,834120,"How do you get up there?",831000,832700,"SPEAKER_08"
834120,836120,"He mustn't fall. He might lose his tail.",833300,846300,"SPEAKER_13"
836120,838120,"Don't move, little dragon.",833300,846300,"SPEAKER_13"
838120,840120,"And Snuffkin, keep quiet.",833300,846300,"SPEAKER_13"
840120,842120,"He might get frightened and do something silly.",833300,846300,"SPEAKER_13"
842120,844120,"Don't worry. I'll soon have you down.",833300,846300,"SPEAKER_13"
844120,846120,"This will do. I'll lay it on the floor here.",833300,846300,"SPEAKER_13"
846120,849120,"Jump, little dragon. Don't be afraid.",833300,846300,"SPEAKER_13"
849120,851120,"Come on. Hold on to this.",847300,849700,"SPEAKER_13"
851120,853120,"It will bring you down slowly.",850200,854400,"SPEAKER_13"
853120,855120,"Don't panic.",850200,854400,"SPEAKER_13"
856120,858120,"I don't think it's a very good idea, Moomin.",850200,854400,"SPEAKER_13"
858120,860120,"You'll only scare him away.",856200,858000,"SPEAKER_08"
860120,862120,"Why don't you just leave him alone?",858900,860100,"SPEAKER_08"
862120,864120,"He'll come down when he's ready.",861200,862500,"SPEAKER_08"
864120,866120,"Dragons aren't helpless, you know, even little baby ones.",862800,866400,"SPEAKER_08"
866120,868120,"But he's so small.",862800,866400,"SPEAKER_08"
868120,869120,"Come to Moomin.",867000,869500,"SPEAKER_13"
869120,872120,"Come on. Don't you understand?",867000,869500,"SPEAKER_13"
872120,874120,"Hold onto that and I'll listen to that.",870800,872000,"SPEAKER_13"
874120,875120,"Ah!",872200,874000,"SPEAKER_13"

904120,907120,"Be careful, Snuffkin. He might bite.",897800,899600,"SPEAKER_12"
907120,910120,"I don't think so. He's a very unusual pet.",904500,906600,"SPEAKER_13"
910120,913120,"I think he'll like you more than me.",904500,906600,"SPEAKER_13"
913120,915120,"Ah!",904500,906600,"SPEAKER_13"

939120,941120,"He's called Little Dragon.",937600,939400,"SPEAKER_14"
941120,943120,"Huh. I don't think he's lovely at all.",940100,941400,"SPEAKER_13"
943120,946120,"Small but savage, if you ask my opinion.",942000,946300,"SPEAKER_14"
946120,948120,"That sounds just like you, little mind.",942000,946300,"SPEAKER_14"
948120,950120,"You think so?",946500,948600,"SPEAKER_11"

960120,962120,"Ah!",958900,961300,"SPEAKER_13"
964120,967120,"He seems to have a thing about ears, doesn't he?",958900,961300,"SPEAKER_13"
967120,969120,"Steps Snuffkins, why doesn't he bite him?",965100,967500,"SPEAKER_10"

993120,994120,"He might be useful.",989400,989400,"SPEAKER_09"
993120,994120,"He might be useful.",989400,990600,"SPEAKER_08"
994120,996120,"When he's bigger, we can put him in the cellar",993300,999200,"SPEAKER_14"
996120,999120,"and he'll be able to heat the whole house just like a furnace.",993300,999200,"SPEAKER_14"

1103120,1104120,"Why did you do that?",1100300,1102900,"SPEAKER_10"
1104120,1107120,"He was cute and we could have always worn earmuffs.",1103200,1105000,"SPEAKER_14"
1107120,1109120,"You can visit him in Snuffkin's tent.",1105000,1115700,"SPEAKER_13"
