1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here they are for one and all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The movements are about to come.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on and sit down here with me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They're here for you on your TV.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the movements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They are the movements.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, what do you think?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm going to say that I'm not going to say it. I'm going to say it. with me, therefore you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:50,000
so come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a moment land, you can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, There was the moment, there was the moments

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There was the moments, there was the moments One night, the moment was having a dream.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What a wonderful feeling to be flying like this!

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Look over there, woman! What a beautiful lake!

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is one of the most fantastic experiences I've ever had!

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,799
Me too! I never knew birds had such a marvelous life.

15
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:31,599
Seeing things from a completely different point of view.

16
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,799
We're flying pretty high aren't we?

17
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,799
I'm scared.

18
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,599
We're much too high.

19
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,799
Let's go down please. Let's go down at once.

20
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,400
I'm not scared of heights.

21
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,200
Oh, Snork, this time you really have succeeded.

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,799
Will I could build hundreds of these if you wanted me to?

23
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,799
Snork, can I steer it just for a little while? Now you can.

24
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,799
Huh?

25
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, stinky. Do you really know how to steer this thing? Yeah!

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hey! Stop it, stinky!

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's dangerous!

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is okay, really! It's just a dream!

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, right. Oh gosh, my head hurt so...

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What a strange dream!

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why would my brother let stinky stare his flying ship?

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Surely not.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I was talking to a snork while I looked away, suddenly stinky took his place.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, and then the thing began tilting?

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Hmm, but it was just a dream.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't care, I don't like it.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You shouldn't have dreams like that just when my brother's flying ship is almost ready.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Dreams often come true, you know.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But it was nothing like the ship your brother's building, it was totally different.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But tell me what happened to it in the end. Did it fall down?

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't know. I lost sight of it when I fell off and I didn't see it again.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, surely you could have turned your hat to take a look.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, I didn't.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Listen, Mum, and don't say a word to the snork about this.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He's nervous enough as it is.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Of course not. Why don't we just forget about it? Pretend it never happened, eh?

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, snork, it's finally completed.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Sure it is, but it hasn't been flown yet, of course.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But it will, I won't, Snork. You don't think there's anything wrong with it?

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Of course not, but it's just...

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Is there some problem, Snork?

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Well, there might be.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So, what is it?

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Fuel.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Fuel?

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,439
But you said you had developed a new fuel that was really good. It's good,

57
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,080
but you see you see it might not be powerful enough. You mean it might not be able to

58
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,620
fly? No it won't. You're quite right. Or it will just be an ordinary ship, not a flying

59
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:29,439
ship. Oh that would be nice. What can't go up can't possibly fall down. But that's not the point if it won't fly. Everyone will laugh at me. I know they will.

60
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,199
I won't laugh, I promise.

61
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,519
Maybe not. Others will.

62
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,800
But you wouldn't care about that, would you? Who cares what other people think?

63
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,639
The thing is, I've already told people that the test flight will be quite soon. In public.

64
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,860
But I'm sure people will be very nice about it even if it doesn't get off the ground.

65
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,220
That's hardly what I want.

66
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,540
Moomin, I'd like to ask you a favor.

67
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,699
That's why I sent for you. Will you help me?

68
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,300
I'll do anything you ask, Snork, of course.

69
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,000
What I would like is for you, Moomin, my friend, to be test pilot for me tomorrow.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You want me to be a pilot? Hey, stinky stinky! Oh, Mom! Listen, stinky, I'm going to steer that shivers up perfectly clear.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You're not to touch the wheel. I'm the pilot now.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What on earth was that a bird?

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Wouldn't you find it difficult to steer it?

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh no, it's real easy. But of course, I'd need to practice before the public demonstration.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Is the snorke going to fly his own ship?

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He'll be there but he has to stay down in the engine room snuff can.

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I wonder if this ship will really fly.

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The only problem is the fuel.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Only the fuel you say. That's a big problem.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I suppose so.

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Listen, Roman. Suppose now the snorke's flying ship really gets off the ground.

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, of course it's going to, Papa.

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That something could happen, something could break,

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
or you could fall into an air pocket.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's such a dangerous undertaking, think, moment.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Papa!

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Now, listen, it's not natural for the moment to fly about up in the air.

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Is it snuffkin'?

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,100
Quite right.

90
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,699
Well, when do you and the snorke do if things went wrong?

91
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,199
We will be wearing parachutes, you know?

92
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,699
Parachutes.

93
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:54,199
You do know what they are, don't you, Papa?

94
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,500
Of course I do.

95
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,500
They come down from the sky like this, like this.

96
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,699
Exactly.

97
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:03,100
But of course, we won't need a parachute.

98
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,600
Because nothing will go wrong.

99
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,139
And I will be the first flying ship pilot ever.

100
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,620
Oh.

101
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,540
Hi there.

102
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,860
Hello, my young man.

103
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,819
Hello.

104
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:16,620
How do you do?

105
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,300
How do you do everybody?

106
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,100
Hello, sir.

107
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,100
Hello, sir.

108
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
I wonder if you can help me.

109
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,000
Do you happen to know where the snorks factory is?

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,600
Eh? You mean the sherd?

111
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,199
I must see him.

112
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,600
I'm most eager to have a look at his famous flying ship.

113
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
How do you know about that?

114
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,800
It's supposed to be very secret.

115
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,399
The information must have leaked out somehow.

116
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh well, all inventors know about what he is trying to do.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,399
He's famous throughout Moomin Valley this snork.

118
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,480
Really? Are you an inventor too? Indeed I am. One of the more famous. I think maybe the most famous of them all.

119
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,480
I am Moomin Papa. How do you do sir? I'm Snuffkin.

120
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:06,000
And my name is Moomin. Please to meet you. A very good date you won and all. The muffles, my name.

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I said I'm the muffled.

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You mean you've never even heard of me the most famous inventor.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh yes, I'm sure I am. The muffled isn't it? Yes, it is the muffled.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,300
Have you invented anything exciting, muffuffle? Mr. Muffle?

125
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,300
Ah, it would be much easier to tell you what I haven't invented young man.

126
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,779
For instance, the pin that can't prick because it has two heads.

127
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,559
The newspaper that reads itself, the purse that moans and groans if you take money from

128
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,779
it, the adhesive tape that sticks only to itself.

129
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,620
This is perhaps the greatest of all my latest inventions.

130
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,840
Whatever is that?

131
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,860
This is proper self a man powered fan.

132
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,860
Infanible in muddy weather.

133
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,860
Oh!

134
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,860
Oh!

135
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,860
Oh!

136
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,860
Oh!

137
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,860
Oh!

138
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,860
Oh!

139
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,860
Oh!

140
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
Oh!

141
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,860
Oh!

142
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,860
Oh!

143
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Oh!

144
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, these are my latest inventions.

145
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You didn't know that did you?

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No, it isn't.

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But try and give her handkerchief, the square balloon,

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
the five wheeled car, the hexagonal frying pan,

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
the seven hole button, and a host of others.

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Indeed, how interesting.

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What did you want to see the snork about?

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I thought I might be able to help him out

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
with one of my inventions. That's what?

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh, Jill, which one?

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
My new?

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No, it's very top-sequence stuff I can tell you.

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Now, where is the snork's factory?

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll take you right there.

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Very kind of you.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,600
Come, he'll be so surprised.

161
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Must be off. See you again.

162
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,799
It's a pleasure to help these buddy inventors.

163
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,799
Snurker will be so excited.

164
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,299
A famous inventor, eh?

165
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,299
What is your opinion, Snurfkin?

166
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:59,299
Have you ever seen a triangular hanker chief, Moomin Papa?

167
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,100
No, and I don't want to either.

168
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,440
I do wonder what he's cooked up for the snork, though.

169
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,159
It is sort of intriguing.

170
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,279
Yes, indeed.

171
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,679
We'll be able to tell us later, I suppose.

172
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,159
Yes, but anything could happen before then.

173
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,159
Can we wait that long, snuffkin?

174
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,159
You're right.

175
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,039
No, wait for me.

176
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,200
I'm coming with you.

177
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,899
Oh, I thought we had several guests!

178
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:50,000
Now where in the world to, I wonder?

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, look who's coming!

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What are you doing here? We're just interested, Dan. Where are the mufflers and the snorke?

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The snorke and the mufflers are discussing some top secret project.

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's very harsh.

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Not a triangular hanker chief, I hope.

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't know, Papa.

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
As I said, it's top secret.

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Let's see.

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Oh, bother.

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The curtains in the back are all over the place. I don't know, Papa. As I said, it's top secret. Mm-hmm, let's see.

189
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,799
Oh, Father, the curtains in the way, so I can't see a thing.

190
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:38,759
So this is the powerful fuel you've developed, is it, Mr. Muffel?

191
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,759
Yes, it is.

192
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,519
Not as original as my other inventions I admit.

193
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,519
But very useful.

194
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,519
Yes, useful.

195
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,879
I call it super fuel.

196
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:50,639
Only trouble is my engine has been designed for liquid fuel.

197
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,440
No problem at all young man.

198
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,879
If you dissolve this block of fuel in 10 liters of water,

199
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:59,000
your engine will run for at least 10 hours.

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,240
For 10 whole hours, that's incredible.

201
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,919
If you doubt the word of the muffler,

202
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,000
then try it out and see for yourself right now.

203
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Right now?

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Better still, I guarantee that if used as it is in a solid state, your engine will run not for ten, but for one hundred hours.

205
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
A hundred hours, but that's incredible. You really must be some inventor.

206
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Indeed, if what you say is true, it would solve the last problem of my flying ship.

207
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Oh, now that I've looked more closely at the padlock, this store isn't locked.

208
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No, it isn't.

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hmm, so if one wanted to see the snorke, one could work right here.

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But why would you want to see him, Papa?

211
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Well, why don't you tell us?

212
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,559
I don't want snorke falling for one of the muffles crazy ideas, that's why.

213
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,559
Well, we'll find out pretty soon.

214
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,240
Maybe you don't realize it, but the snork is pretty clever, you know.

215
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,039
I think I know exactly what they're doing in there.

216
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,559
Yeah, what?

217
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,559
I saw that man pouring something into the flying ship.

218
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,559
What was it?

219
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,559
Well, I guess it must have been fuel, movement.

220
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,159
How come you show him?

221
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,600
There's a crack that's just about wide enough for me.

222
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,299
But I won't tell you where.

223
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,399
What are those two in there talking about?

224
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,639
Oh, yeah?

225
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,799
So this is the great super fuel?

226
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,960
Wait a minute, Snark.

227
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,559
There must be something wrong with it.

228
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,360
Yeah, you are.

229
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,159
What the...

230
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,240
How do you do it?

231
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
There you are.

232
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,879
Solid fuel indeed, huh?

233
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,000
100 hours?

234
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,559
You're an imposter, sir.

235
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:30,759
Oh, it isn't true if you just let me explain.

236
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,879
No, thank you.

237
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,879
I know very well why you came over here

238
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,360
with that ridiculous story off with you right now.

239
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,559
Listen to me.

240
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,399
It is not ridiculous, and it is not just a story.

241
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,000
Maybe we shouldn't have dissolved it in the water.

242
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,159
That was a mistake.

243
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,080
Imposter!

244
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,960
But I'm the muffler!

245
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Oh!

246
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,080
Well, maybe it's just a misunderstanding

247
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,200
and the fuel isn't suited for flying ships.

248
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,879
Wrong, it suits everything!

249
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,320
Forget the fuel!

250
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,240
That was just a trick so we could come here

251
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,639
and get to see my flying ship.

252
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,639
So the muffler has come here to spy me.

253
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,919
Ridiculous!

254
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:05,500
I don't steal!

255
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,000
Papa, was there anything you wanted to see me about?

256
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Eh?

257
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No, I just dropped by.

258
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No cause for excitement.

259
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,500
The fuels are done.

260
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
No, it's not. That's not true.

261
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,500
I don't invent guns. What would be the point of inventing them?

262
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Oh, listen to me, please.

263
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Let's try and use the fuel once more.

264
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,000
No, thanks. Once was once too many.

265
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'll have to clean my tanks from your gunge.

266
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Get out of my sight!

267
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, dear, this must have been a bit of a disappointment for the snork.

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,159
I know.

269
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,639
Now listen, stinky.

270
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,840
I'm doing this for the snorksake, isn't that so?

271
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,279
I don't care if you're doing it for all I want is to get a good look at the famous flying ship.

272
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,159
You'd need something very powerful to get a thing like that off the ground.

273
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:11,200
Something so powerful that only I, the muffle, could ever have invented it.

274
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,799
Remind me one day to show you my famous triangular handkerchief.

275
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,639
Now all we have to do is not dissolve the fuel in water but use the solid fuel.

276
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:24,399
Hurry up with that log, Sticky, or maybe I should invent a log pick.

277
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,480
Come on, sticky.

278
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
Hurry, hurry.

279
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,559
There you are done.

280
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,679
Good come, we don't have much time.

281
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,559
No, I'm dying to steer this ship.

282
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:37,080
Oh, me up.

283
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,000
Take it up to 2,000 meters.

284
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah.

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,519
Whoa.

286
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,240
Oh, sticky, sticky.

287
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,320
We're flying at a height of just over 2,000 meters now.

288
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
stinky!

289
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,639
Yeah, I'm listening, what is it?

290
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,240
When you hear me say now, that's when I want you

291
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,440
to start up the engine immediately.

292
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,960
All right, no problem.

293
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,480
Guess it must be this one.

294
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,720
No, no, not yet.

295
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,840
This is it!

296
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,879
Just a drop of water on the fuel block.

297
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,519
Now that should do it.

298
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,000
Can I start it now?

299
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Not yet!

300
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Alright!

301
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Now start on the interesting key!

302
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Now you answer!

303
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Did you really turn on the switch?

304
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes I did!

305
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The engine won't start.

306
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Are you quite sure you turned the one I pointed out to you?

307
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I think so. Maybe I turned the wrong one.

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
There. Outside these two is well.

309
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Come on, stinky. This is no joke. My reputation is a famous inventor. Is it steak?

310
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This should do it, I think. Is that work, Mr. Mapple?

311
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,600
Nothing is happening. I do. I shouldn't have let you do it better to do it myself.

312
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,759
You're useless.

313
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,080
Wait, Mr. Mapple.

314
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,159
I haven't tried the very last one in the row.

315
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:50,960
This one switched.

316
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,200
What?

317
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,480
I better throw that one too.

318
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,399
You never know. It might just do the trick.

319
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,399
Oh.

320
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,399
Oh.

321
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,399
Oh.

322
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,399
Oh.

323
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,399
Oh.

324
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,399
Oh.

325
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,399
Oh.

326
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,399
Oh.

327
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,400
It works.

328
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,000
It works. I know it works. I know it works. Oh. It works! It works! I know it works!

329
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I know it works!

330
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It is working!

331
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm not surprised, but I'm so pleased with myself.

332
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You should be here, Snort. This is my great moment, and you should be here to share it with me.

333
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Come on, I can't wait to try this thing.

334
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Incredible! This ship shall rise like a Phoenix.

335
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Not the most demanding thing, but this is one of my diesel inventions.

336
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,240
Ha, ha! Ha!

337
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,500
Casper! Casper!

338
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Winner!

339
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Come on, let's go! Come on!

340
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Sheer power!

341
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't think he ever has started up.

342
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I very much have created exploding!

343
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Hey stinky religions exploding!

344
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Where the fuck are you going?

345
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
A bad shit!

346
00:18:26,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's going to explode any minute by a wonderful invention! Hmm? Ah!

347
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh! Oh! Now come to your nice room on the small side but the very best one.

348
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That explosion...it really was most unexpected officer.

349
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Everybody knows you're a great inventor. I wonder if you could help me Mr. Muffle.

350
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But how?

351
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,200
Could you think of something to protect my roses while you're staying with us?

352
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
A non-explosive, of course.

353
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Of course I could.

354
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,799
Piece of cake, officer.

355
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,599
Oh, I really did want to fly.

356
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Come, come now, cheer up, snorke dear.

357
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,599
Here you are, a nice cup of tea.

358
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,960
Thanks.

359
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,960
Oh.

360
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,480
It's very strange, but I had a dream the other night about a flying ship.

361
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,119
Did you really move in? That sounds very interesting.

362
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,799
Yes, very interesting.

363
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,599
Moment, tell me about it.

364
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:06,160
Yes. It was a peculiar looking ship totally different from Northline ships, Snork.

365
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
Different?

366
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
Oh.

367
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,599
Well, it was sort of round like this.

368
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:16,400
It had a propeller and something hanging underneath.

369
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,839
And we flew over a high mountain.

370
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,839
Round?

371
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,839
Yes.

372
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,440
And you were in a sort of thing hanging underneath.

373
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,000
Yes. Round. were in a sort of thing hanging underneath. Yes.

374
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Round.

375
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Round, huh?

376
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Round.

377
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What, ever's the match I snuck?

378
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What?

379
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Oh, mama.

380
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Thanks for the tea.

381
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I think I'm getting a new idea.

382
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Moving.

383
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
See you later.

384
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Papa, I must go.

385
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,960
Oh, there he goes again. I know that, see you later. Papa, I must go. Oh, fair he goes again.

386
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,400
I know that, look, Mama.

387
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,000
You won't get an intelligent answer out of him for the next month or so, honestly.

388
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,799
I'm very happy for him.

389
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,200
I must say that was a very clever dream you had, woman.

390
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,039
I'm a better inventor than the mobile.

391
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,000
You deserve a triangular acruchy.

392
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So the explosion didn't distress the sword for long.

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Soon he was back at his favorite occupation, planning.

394
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But planning what?

395
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Rome.

396
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Rome? Wrong

397
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Wrong

398
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:47,000
They love the laughter and and caring and giving the movements

399
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
They're always happy and goes at play

400
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The moments I've been fun day after day, the movements

401
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The movements, the movements The most
