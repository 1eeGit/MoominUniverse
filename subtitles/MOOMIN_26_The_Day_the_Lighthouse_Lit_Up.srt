1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here they are for one and all, the movements are about to come, come on and sit down here with me,

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here for you are your TV, they are the movements, they are the movements,

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So come with me, give me your hand, I'll take you up to a movement land,

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You can fly just like a bird, sing that song ever, there were the movements,

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There were the movements, there were the movements, there were the movements,

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:58,000
da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,700
Dan, do you think it's broken, Papa?

9
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,500
Well, I'm not sure. I've not had a great deal of experience with this sort of thing.

10
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,400
Look over there, Moomin. It's the boy and the fisherman from the boat.

11
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,900
They're a bit strange, aren't they?

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,900
They must live somewhere here on the island.

13
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,900
Let's see.

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,500
What?

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,500
Oh, thank you. Leave it by the door when you haven't quite finished yet.

16
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Well, at least we can see the floor now.

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I think the keeper must be lying dead under the desk.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Nobody's cleaned here for a long time. That's for sure.

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,500
That probably means the lighthouse lamp hasn't been working for ages either.

20
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
I wonder if Papa will be able to fix it.

21
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,500
I wonder if they're going to manage to get the light working all right.

22
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Well, the lighthouse without a lamp is pretty sad, isn't it?

23
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Come on, light, will you?

24
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Right, I'll give you one last chance.

25
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,000
Then I'm getting the big spanner. Now you don't know me, but I don't give in easily.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,500
Especially to machines.

27
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:36,000
Have you thought brass brain what will happen tonight if there's a storm and there's a ship out there looking for land or trying to keep off the rocks and there's no light to guide them?

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You'll be sorry Dan, but it'll be too late.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,500
And all I can say is that if the light hasn't been working for some time that I'm afraid that there could have been many shipwrecks.

30
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Oh, that's awful.

31
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Well, it would be dangerous to come too close to the island without a light to help you.

32
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,000
I wouldn't be surprised if that ghost ship went one of them.

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It all seems very strange, and I wonder what made the lighthouse keeper leave in such a hurry.

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Unspeakable horror. Please be quiet, little my.

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's obvious. Close, thrown above dishes left unwashed, jigsaw puzzles have finished.

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's an unsolved mystery of the sea, just like the Marie Celeste.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And if you don't understand that, then you're being even stupider. Then usual.

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh, dear poor man, I wonder what he was like.

39
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He must have been very lonely here on his own.

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He scribbled messages over the walls like no side of a ship.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's Christmas, another month gone. I must clean the lamp, and I need to talk to someone.

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh, well, if he didn't see many ships, at least they could have been many shipwrecks either.

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, I hope not, Papa. That would be one good thing anyway.

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Perhaps the sea came and took him on a dark and stormy night, and he was swept out and no one saw him go.

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's rubbish, little my. On dark and stormy nights, lighthouse keeper sits safe by a fire drinking hot tea laced with rum.

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He might have run out of rum and gone to get more.

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, I don't think anything terrible happened to him. He just got more and more lonely and fed up and then went off and got a girlfriend.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Be careful, snuffkin. It's very rough, but not even, and you don't want to fall into the sea.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I certainly don't. Now, watch your step. The rocks are very slippery.

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, are you all right?

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes, Lang, so I didn't think they'd be a slippery is all that.

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's the matter? Look over there. There's something moving, but I can't see what it is.

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's probably a boat.

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No, that's what I call a real ship.

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's not a real one.

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What do you mean?

57
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's the ghost ship, the one we saw last night.

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're right. Why isn't it come back, snuffkin? What does it want?

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't know. Perhaps it followed us to the island and for some reason wants to make contact.

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's go home, snuffkin. I don't like this.

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What's up?

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh, no. Shut up. I'm having a great dream, and you can see the view.

63
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Wait. Oh, it was horrible. Someone stepped on my face.

64
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, none of us sleepwalking since we were all asleep. Why don't you just be quiet?

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
They're very odd.

66
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No, somebody's on my stomach now. Don't be stupid.

67
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, have a look, snuffkin. There must be something there. Please, snuffkin, please.

68
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can't see any. What's that?

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What is it?

70
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't know yet, movement. I think I can see a pair of feet.

71
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
A pair of feet.

72
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My legs just feet.

73
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But that means a ghost.

74
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh, help. Get it off me. Go away, go away.

75
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let me at them. Where are they? I'll teach them to spoil my dream.

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
They're on my face now. Go away, will you?

77
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
No. Show me it. But no, stamp on it.

78
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Stop it, move away.

79
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No, it's my fault.

80
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You go fishing again today. No, I'm not.

81
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, do you need me or is it all right if I go and see those people in the lighthouse?

82
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No, I don't want you one.

83
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay, goodbye then.

84
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You mean this room is really haunted?

85
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It certainly is.

86
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But we only saw a pair of feet.

87
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll sleep here tonight. Don't worry, I'll protect you.

88
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Are you going to scare it away, Papa?

89
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I can't find any good shells.

90
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're me.

91
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What about this one?

92
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh yes, that's lovely.

93
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Go on, take it. I don't collect them.

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Who are you?

95
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, I'm a ghost, sort of.

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Are you the rat who walked over us last night?

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You were lucky I didn't grab you.

98
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Sorry, it wasn't just me. There were a few of us.

99
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Now walk over each other.

100
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Can I give you a present?

101
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can't get around me that easily.

102
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You better show yourselves or you'll be sorry.

103
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's just me. The others have all left me and gone off with the ship.

104
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Ha, so why didn't you go with them?

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, I wanted to, but well...

106
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Come on, out with it.

107
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Well...

108
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Never got me and let me all of my own and I was frightened.

109
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, I can see why they wouldn't want a drippy thing like you around.

110
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You call yourself a ghost.

111
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I know, I'm sorry.

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I just can't work out what's wrong with it.

113
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Let's try and see what happens here.

114
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, heavens, oh my, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

115
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, no!

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You were right, Pop-Up!

117
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, thank goodness you are here, quick!

118
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Open all the windows, I'm choking!

119
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

120
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh, my God.

121
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Mmm, this is great. That soup I've had for ages, Moome and Mama.

122
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Would you like some more?

123
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh, he has, please.

124
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Can I have the recipe? I could make some for the fisherman. I know he'd love it.

125
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll write it out for you. What's his name?

126
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't know. He doesn't say.

127
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I've come from the north. I left about three months ago,

128
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
although it seems a lot longer, and I'd been rowing south in my small boat,

129
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
trying to reach Moome and Valley.

130
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, really? We live there.

131
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Do you? You're lucky. It must be very nice. I've never been there,

132
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
but I've heard that it's beautiful.

133
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Anyway, there was a violent storm in my little boat capsized.

134
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He rescued me, and I've stayed with him in his cabin ever since.

135
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And he doesn't talk about himself at all. That's very strange.

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No, but I think he does have a big secret.

137
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
How do you know, Taft?

138
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Well, sometimes he just stares and stares at the lighthouse in any sort of size.

139
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I wonder why.

140
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I did ask him once, but he glared at me in such a nasty way.

141
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I haven't dared say a word about it since.

142
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You don't want to stay with him then?

143
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh, yes. Well, most of the time he's really nice to me,

144
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and since I've been here, I've sort of taken care of him,

145
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
because you see he doesn't really look after himself.

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Could I have a cup of tea, please, Mama?

147
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes, dear. How is the light coming along?

148
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Oh, not very well. There's still a few more things I could try, though.

149
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Hello. You were on that boat fishing, weren't you?

150
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes, I was. My name is Taft, Mum and Papa.

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh, please, to meet you.

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Is your friend here as well? I wanted to ask him something.

153
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There's something quite important.

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ask him what?

155
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, about this lighthouse for one thing.

156
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Well, he won't talk about that. He just refuses to.

157
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh, dear, does he?

158
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The thing is, I'm trying to light this beacon, but having no success.

159
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I wondered whether he might know if there's an easy way of doing it.

160
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You never know. I might have missed something.

161
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's very quiet.

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
He might be out fishing, you know.

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Come on, let's go.

164
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Where are you going, Moomin?

165
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I want to ask that man some questions.

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He doesn't seem to be the kind of guy who does a lot of talking.

167
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Do you think he might know something about the lighthouse keeper?

168
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's what I want to find out.

169
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Hello. My name is Moomin, and this is my friend, Snuffkin.

170
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What's your business here?

171
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I wonder, do you live here?

172
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I suppose you must have met the lighthouse keeper, have you?

173
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't want people to have other matters.

174
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We were just curious about why you left the lighthouse. Do you know why?

175
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
No, you kept himself to himself.

176
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Oh, so you do know it. When did he leave?

177
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Where did he go? You must know.

178
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Get.

179
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Oh, please. Had the light stopped working before he left?

180
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Why did he leave the door open? Were there any shipwrecks?

181
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Wait a minute, just one more question, please.

182
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, don't go.

183
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There's something very important I need to know.

184
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You're the only other person on the island apart from the ghost ship.

185
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Oh, no, please, come back.

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Look, my father is trying to get the lamp working again, but not getting anywhere.

187
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So if you know where the keeper is, or better still, how to light it,

188
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
will you please help?

189
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's not only for us, but for all those ships that might be in danger without it.

190
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh.

191
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Moomin.

192
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't think that man knows much about anything.

193
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Well, at least he's heard you and knows what you want.

194
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's go, Moomin.

195
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Moomin.

196
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Look, over there, what's Moomin Papa doing?

197
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Snort made an a little Maya helping him.

198
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Hiya!

199
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Come on.

200
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah.

201
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's about time. Where are you two being?

202
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What are you building now?

203
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We're making a raft.

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Why?

205
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Because we wanted to stupid.

206
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Why else would we build it?

207
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Do you like it?

208
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But why do you want a raft?

209
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's not really a raft, is it Papa?

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Let me present our very own hand-built ghost ship.

211
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
A ghost ship?

212
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He must be here somewhere.

213
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Well, if he's the one that walked on me last night,

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I want a word with him.

215
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes, sorry.

216
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm afraid that was me and my friends.

217
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, where are you?

218
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Show us a bit of leg, at least.

219
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I like to see you I'm talking to.

220
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yes, all right.

221
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh, well, at least he looks like a ghost.

222
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Thank you.

223
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Ghosts look pretty silly when the sun's shining if you ask me.

224
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Well, it was your idea.

225
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I always thought ghosts were frightening me.

226
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes, we forgot our chains last night.

227
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's very hard to be ghostly without them.

228
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We did our best to scare you, though.

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The ghost came to this island because the lighthouse was a bit like an ancient castle.

230
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
We feel more at home in castle.

231
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And now when they found us here, they changed their minds and gave up.

232
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That's funny, isn't it?

233
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What's the matter?

234
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You look a bit fed up.

235
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's because he's been left behind by the other ghosts.

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
They've gone off in the ghost ship.

237
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Wow, they didn't tell me they were going straight away.

238
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And I'd gone to the lighthouse keepers cabin.

239
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The lighthouse keeper?

240
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Why did you go there?

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Well, I wanted to tell him that some strange people.

242
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I mean, strangers had moved into the lighthouse and that he'd be better off with us

244
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
because ghosts don't damage things.

245
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I didn't know you then, of course.

246
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But some people are very kind.

247
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Where is his cabin?

248
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Is it easy to find?

249
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
At the southern end of the island.

250
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But it was a waste of time because he wouldn't talk to me.

251
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I shouldn't have bothered.

252
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And then I would have caught the boat.

253
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Anyway, he's not going back to his job.

254
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So that's that.

255
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Bye-bye.

256
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Thanks again for the raft.

257
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Take care.

258
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I hope you catch up with your friends real soon.

259
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Thank you.

260
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You're okay for mortals.

261
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I promise next time we meet up he rallies, Gary.

262
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Chains and all.

263
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Lots of chains.

264
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And we promise to be terrified.

265
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You can come and scare me anytime you want.

266
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Bye-bye.

267
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Relating a charm.

268
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Bye-bye.

269
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
He said anything that could float would do.

270
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But that raft seemed a bit flimsy to me.

271
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I wouldn't like to chance it.

272
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It can be rough out there.

273
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

274
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Ghost can't drown.

275
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Can they?

276
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
They're dead already.

277
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Mama.

278
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What is it, Moomin, dear?

279
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Poppa's gone fishing again.

280
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Well, he's gone fishing again.

281
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Well, he enjoys it.

282
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, that's all he seems to do these days.

283
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
He's not working on the lamp at all.

284
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well, perhaps living in a new place makes him want to do a new thing.

285
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And he does catch one now and again.

286
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What are you making, little boy?

287
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
An elevator.

288
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
An elevator?

289
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yes, and when that's finished, I'm going to build a house.

290
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, my goodness.

291
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
A house of my very own.

292
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Moomin, Papa, doesn't seem his usual happy self,

293
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
even though he enjoys his fishing.

294
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He's upset that he couldn't make the lamp work and isn't used to failure,

295
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
but nothing he tries makes any difference.

296
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What a pity it would be to leave the island without seeing the beautiful beams

297
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
shining over the water.

298
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh, my goodness.

299
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh, my goodness.

300
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah, hey, come and have a look.

301
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Everyone, I finished my house.

302
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Hey, Moomin, Papa, come here. The fisherman's coming.

303
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Wow, the fisherman.

304
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes, and the boy is with him.

305
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The loft is outside.

306
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You don't want to do it, do you?

307
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
No, but I've got to do it.

308
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Right.

309
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Here you are.

310
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So, uh, what can we do for you?

311
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Oh!

312
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Happy birthday. Happy birthday to you.

313
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Hmm?

314
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Tough just told us it's your birthday today,

315
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
so all the best wishes from us.

316
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
My birthday? Is it really?

317
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Excuse me for asking, but how old are you?

318
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I just don't remember.

319
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It doesn't matter. I'm sorry we don't have any presents.

320
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I haven't had coffee for many, many years.

321
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Bring the barrel, Moomin, Mama.

322
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yes, dear.

323
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Now, let me see, I found this sauerster.

324
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I wonder if it suits me. What do you think?

325
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh.

326
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I suppose this must belong to the lighthouse keeper.

327
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Why don't you try it on?

328
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You look good in a sauerster. There it suits you.

329
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We'd love to know why you left the island

330
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
and why you didn't come back in

331
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and also why you didn't like the land.

332
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
We really would like to know if you feel you could tell us.

333
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I was so lonely.

334
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
For years and years.

335
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Then I just went away.

336
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm afraid that's all.

337
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But you did come back. Surely that must mean something.

338
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I knew I'd lived here for too long.

339
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Much too long.

340
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You see, I didn't really fit in anywhere else.

341
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
This is the lighthouse keeper's uniform, isn't it?

342
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Why don't you put it on again?

343
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And look, it's nice here.

344
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'd like to stay with you, mind that.

345
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'll stay if you let me.

346
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Ah, I'd love that.

347
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It'd be fun to see you looking like a lighthouse keeper.

348
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Oh, hooray!

349
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Oh, hooray!

350
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Three days later, the movements left the island.

351
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
They decided to leave at night

352
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
with the safe blow of the lighthouse beams guiding their path

353
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
out in the way to movement valley.

354
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Movement papa had quite forgotten about his epic novel of the sea,

355
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
but couldn't wait to start again on his memoirs.

356
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

357
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

358
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
They're always happy and always at play.

359
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

360
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The movements.

361
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The movements.

362
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They love the laughter and they love the living, the movements.

363
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.

364
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
They're always happy and always at play.

365
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The movements are having fun day after day.

366
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The movements.

367
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The movements.

368
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The movements.

369
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Believing in sharing and caring and giving the movements.
